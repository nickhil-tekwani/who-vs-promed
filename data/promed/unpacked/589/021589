Fifteen children have now died from Strep A in Britain this winter [2022] as the killer bug outbreak rumbles on. Strep A bacteria can cause a myriad of infections, including impetigo, scarlet fever and strep throat. The vast majority of cases are mild. In extremely rare cases, however, the bacteria can penetrate the blood and trigger a life-threatening complication called invasive Group A Strep (iGAS). Almost 170 children have been hit by this complication already this season, health chiefs confirmed today [8 Dec 2022].

Two of the most severe, but rare, forms of invasive disease are necrotising fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Necrotising fasciitis is also known as the 'flesh-eating disease' and can occur if a wound gets infected. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is a rapidly progressing infection causing low blood pressure/shock and damage to organs such as the kidneys, liver and lungs.

Strep A outbreaks tend to start to gather speed in the New Year, before peaking in the spring. But cases have taken off earlier than usual this year [2022]. Overall, 659 cases of iGAS have been detected so far in England, 60 of which have been fatal. UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) data suggests 5 times as many infants have been struck down this winter [2022], compared to before COVID. Some 169 cases of iGAS in under-14s were recorded between 12 Sep and 4 Dec 2022. For comparison, 431 developed the complication during the entirety of 2017/18 -- considered the last 'bad' year. Among children this year [2022], cases are most common among 1 to 4-year-olds (85), followed by 5 to 9-year-olds (60), under-ones (13) and 10 to 14-year-olds (11).

In England, there have been 13 iGAS deaths among under-15s. There has also been one fatality in Northern Ireland and another in Wales, bringing the UK total to 15. In the last bad season in England, there were 27 deaths among children. But the case fatality ratio -- the number of confirmed infections that die -- is in-line with previous years, the UKHSA said.

And the majority of England's total 659 cases continue to be among adults, with 490 infections and 47 fatalities among over-18s since mid-September [2022]. Some 23 of the deaths have been among over-75s.

Rates of iGAS are highest in Yorkshire (1.8 cases per 100 000 people), followed by the South East (1.4). Levels were lowest in the East of England and London (0.9).

The UKHSA said there is usually a surge in iGAS cases every 3 to 4 years but social distancing during the COVID pandemic 'may have interrupted this cycle and explain the current increase'. It said: 'The increase is likely to reflect increased susceptibility to these infections in children due to low numbers of cases during the pandemic.'

High rates of other respiratory viruses -- including flu, RSV and norovirus -- may be putting children at higher risk of co-infections with Strep A, leaving them more susceptible to severe illness, the UKHSA suggested.

There is no evidence that a new strain of iGAS is behind the outbreak but scientists are investigating what other factors could be behind the spike, it said.

They are also examining an increase in lower respiratory tract iGAS infections in children over recent weeks, particularly emphysema -- damage to the air sacs in the lungs.

Meanwhile, the UKHSA has logged 6601 cases of scarlet fever -- which is caused by Strep A. This is 2.5 times higher than the 2017/18 season. More than 1000 cases were reported in the most recent week alone.

It is 'important' that scarlet fever cases are 'treated promptly with antibiotics to limit further spread and reduce risk of potential complications' among those infected and their close contacts, the UKHSA said.

Phenoxymethylpenicillin, amoxicillin and clarithromycin are 3 antibiotics used to treat Strep A infections.

Health chiefs have advised doctors to have a 'low threshold' for prescribing these to youngsters who have suspected Strep A, raising concerns that this could lead to antibiotic resistance -- when the treatment becomes less effective against bacteria due to overuse. But the UKHSA today [8 Dec 2022] emphasised that antibiotic resistance is not on the rise. Dr Colin Brown, deputy director at the UKHSA, said: 'Scarlet fever and "strep throat" are common childhood illnesses that can be treated easily with antibiotics. Please visit NHS.uk, contact 111 online or your GP surgery if your child has symptoms of this infection so they can be assessed for treatment. Very rarely, the bacteria can get into the bloodstream and cause a more serious illness called invasive Group A strep. We know that this is concerning for parents, but I want to stress that while we are seeing an increase in cases in children, this remains very uncommon.'

He added: 'There are lots of winter bugs circulating that can make your child feel unwell, that mostly aren't cause for alarm. However, make sure you talk to a health professional if your child is getting worse after a bout of scarlet fever, a sore throat or respiratory infection -- look out for signs such as a fever that won't go down, dehydration, extreme tiredness and difficulty breathing.'

As a parent, if you feel that your child seems seriously unwell, you should trust your own judgement. You should contact NHS 111 or your GP if:
- your child is sick and is getting worse
- your child is feeding or eating much less than normal
- your child has had a dry nappy for 12 hours or more or shows other signs of dehydration
- your baby is under 3 months and has a temperature of 38°C, or is older than 3 months and has a temperature of 39°C or higher
- your baby feels hotter than usual when you touch their back or chest, or feels sweaty
- your child is very tired or irritable

You should call 999 or go straight to A&E if:
- your child is having difficulty breathing -- you may notice grunting noises or their tummy sucking under their ribs
- there are pauses when your child breathes
- your child's skin, tongue or lips are blue
- your child is floppy and will not wake up or stay awake

[For a discussion of group A streptococcal (GAS) infections, please see my moderator comments in ProMED posts Streptococcus, group A - UK: (England) invasive, children, fatal 20221126.8706918 and Streptococcus group A, scarlet fever - UK: (England) seasonal increased cases 20220424.8702816.

Although the news report says that there is no evidence that a new strain of iGAS is behind the current outbreak, upper respiratory GAS isolates having a distinctive emm type 1 (designated M1UK) increased significantly in England over the time period of 2014 to 2016, so that by 2016 it represented 84% of all emm1 strains isolated (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6838661/). The new strain's emergence coincided with a rise in invasive GAS infections in the UK. The invasive GAS isolates collected in the same period in the UK were also M1UK (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30446-3/fulltext). M1UK was found to produce 9 times more streptococcal exotoxin than previous versions of emm type 1 isolates. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources as it becomes available. - Mod.ML
