[We are informed that the affected calves are about 10 months old,
born on the same farm. They have been vaccinated twice since birth,
the last time in mid December 2010.

The Kibbutz Beit Zera is situated very close (less than 1 km/0.6 mi)
to the Jordan river on its west side, and 3 km/1.8 mi from the Yarmuq
river separating Israel from the Kingdom of Jordan, on its east. This
area maintains an abundant wild boar population. It will be
interesting to check for the possible circulation of FMD virus within
the wild boars. In addition, it is of importance to obtain information
from neighbouring Jordan on the FMD situation there.

Serotyping was carried out on Friday, 11 Mar 2011; the causative
agent is FMDV serotype O. - Mod.AS
