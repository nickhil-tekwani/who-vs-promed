Cholera has affected 26 people in the Russian Caucasus republic of Dagestan
according to Gennady Onishchenko, the first deputy health minister. The
epidemic broke out in the south of the republic, and measures had been
taken to contain it, he said, adding that nobody had yet died. Onishchenko
said the disease could have come from neighbouring Azerbaijan, but it had
been spread by poor social conditions, including poverty and the lack of
drinking water.
