For years it has been suspected that brucellosis and bovine
tuberculosis, introduced diseases that are common in wood bison in
Wood Buffalo National Park, also occur in bison immediately west of
the park. Evidence of brucellosis exposure has now been detected in 2
bison about 20 km [12.4 miles] west of Wood Buffalo National Park.
Hunters, ranchers, Metis Settlements and First Nations in the area
will continue to be informed on risks of disease and future bison
management.

Under provincial legislation, wood bison east of Highway 35 and west
of Wood Buffalo National Park can be hunted without a license, except
in Caribou Mountains Wildland Provincial Park. Some hunters
participate in disease surveillance by providing samples for testing.
An outfitter, provided with information and sample kits by Sustainable
Resource Development, harvested 2 adult female bison in February and
March [2011] that tested positive for exposure to brucellosis. The
Canadian Food Inspection Agency verified the results on 22 July 2011.


The risk of disease transmission to humans remains very low and those
who continue to harvest bison west of Wood Buffalo National Park are
encouraged to contact the local Fish and Wildlife office for
information on the risks associated with brucellosis and tuberculosis.
As a precaution:

-- any bison harvested should be handled carefully with gloves and
examined for signs of disease, obvious lesions or other unusual
features; and
-- if the meat is to be eaten, it must be cooked thoroughly -- smoking
the meat is not sufficient to kill the bacteria that cause these
diseases.

The Alberta government has a disease-management program to protect the
province's agriculture industry and disease-free wood bison in
northwestern Alberta. All free-ranging wood bison detected on private
agricultural lands near Fort Vermilion, La Crete and within 10
kilometres [6.2 miles] of Highway 35 will be removed. Bison
populations west of Wood Buffalo National Park will continue to be
surveyed to confirm numbers, location and whether they carry any
disease. This effort will continue until a long-term solution is
applied to the bison in and around Wood Buffalo National Park.

[Brucellosis, in cattle, water buffalo, and bison is caused almost
exclusively by _Brucella abortus_; however, _B. suis_ or _B.
melitensis_ are occasionally implicated in some cattle herds. _B.
suis_ does not appear to be contagious from cow to cow. Infection
spreads rapidly and causes many abortions in unvaccinated cattle. In a
herd in which the disease is endemic, an infected cow typically aborts
only once after exposure; subsequent gestations and lactations appear
normal. After exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a short period
and develop agglutinins and other antibodies; some resist infection
and a small percentage of infected cows recover. A positive serum
agglutination test usually precedes an abortion or a normal
parturition but may be delayed in about 15 percent of cows. The
incubation period may be variable and is inversely related to stage of
gestation at time of exposure. Organisms are shed in milk and uterine
discharges, and the cow may become temporarily infertile. Bacteria may
be found in the uterus during pregnancy, uterine involution, and
infrequently, for a prolonged time, in the non-gravid uterus. Shedding
from the vagina largely disappears with the decrease of fluids
following parturition. Some infected cows that previously aborted shed
brucellae from the uterus at subsequent normal parturitions. Organisms
are shed in milk for a variable length of time -- in most cattle for
life.

Natural transmission occurs by ingestion of organisms, which are
present in large numbers in aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and
uterine discharges. Cattle may ingest contaminated feed and water, or
lick contaminated genitals of other animals. Venereal transmission by
infected bulls to susceptible cows appears to be rare. Transmission
may occur by artificial insemination when _Brucella_ -contaminated
semen is deposited in the uterus but, reportedly, not when deposited
in the mid-cervix. Brucellae may enter the body through mucous
membranes, conjunctivae, wounds, or intact skin.

Brucellae have been recovered from fetuses and from manure that has
remained in a cool environment for more than 2 months. Exposure to
direct sunlight kills the organisms within a few hours.

Because organisms are shed in the milk, unpasteurized milk, and cheese
represent a human health concern. Many individuals believe drinking
unpasteurized milk is better for their health. Diseases that are not
killed by pasteurization represent a risk to the consumer. Brucellosis
in humans causes malaise, fever, chills, sweats, headache, neck pain,
low back pain, joint pain, muscle pain, occasionally diarrhea,
constipation, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, weakness,
irritability, insomnia, and depression. Brucellosis has been called
undulating fever because of its habit of producing fever and signs
that wax and wane over an extended period of time.
