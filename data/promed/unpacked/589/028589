Japan's Agriculture Ministry said on Monday a beef cow had been confirmed
to have died of anthrax on a farm in Miyazaki Prefecture, southern Japan,
the first such outbreak in nine years.
It ruled out the possibility of the disease spreading to humans or to other
cattle. "A beef cow on a farm in Miyazaki Prefecture died of anthrax on
Friday," the ministry said in a statement. "It's the first time since 1991,
but we don't expect the disease to spread as we have been taking proper
measures."
The ministry said it had found no further case(s) of anthrax on other
cattle on the farm or cattle on neighbouring farms after destroying the
infected cow on Saturday. It imposed a ban on transport of cattle from the
area, and ordered sanitation steps and vaccination of cattle in the area.
A ministry official said it was investigating the cause of the outbreak.
Anthrax is a bacterial infection which causes rapid death in cattle, sheep
and goats which eat contaminated material. It is very occasionally caught
by people, mainly through scratches or eating contaminated food.

According to the Miyazaki Prefectural Government, one cattle (cow) had died
of anthrax. It is the first case in 9 years in Japan. The Prefectural
Government ordered to destroy the body of the infected cattle and not to
move other 12 cattle in the same farm for about 2 weeks.
Miyazaki is located in the southwest of Japan, where a foot-and-mouth
disease outbreak had been reported in this Spring.

[Two weeks quarantine of an affected herd is the optimum -- for the farmer
and with competent vaccination no further cases should be seen after eight
days. Taking into account the attention lavished on beef stock in Japan, I
must admit to wondering whether this might be a case resulted from
contaminated feed, not grazing. - MHJ]
