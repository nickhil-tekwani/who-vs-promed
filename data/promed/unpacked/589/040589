Gardeners in NSW have been urged to wear face masks and gloves when handling potting mix and compost to avoid contracting legionnaires' disease.

The warning comes after a Sydney woman aged in her 60s died from the disease last week [week of 19 Nov 2022] after handling potting mix. NSW Health said there had been 96 cases of legionnaires' disease this year [2022] from the type of bacteria that can be found in potting mix and soils.

NSW Health executive director Jeremy McAnulty urged gardeners to wear masks and gloves when handling potting mix. '"Most people who breathe in the bacteria don't become ill, but the risk of infection increases if you're older, a smoker, or have a weakened immune system," Dr McAnulty said.

"Wetting the potting mix first also helps prevent any contaminated potting mix dust blowing up into the air and being inhaled. Even if you've been wearing gloves, make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap before eating or drinking as the bacteria could still be there."

_Legionella longbeachae_ bacteria is often found in potting mix and can cause Legionnaires' disease if someone inhales dust from contaminated soil.

NSW Health said that symptoms of legionnaires' disease can develop up to 10 days after exposure to the bacteria and include fever, chills, a cough, shortness of breath, aching muscles, headache, tiredness, loss of appetite, and diarrhoea.

Harriet Whiley, associate professor in environmental health at Flinders University, stressed the importance of wearing a mask when using potting mix. "Legionnaires' disease is not transmitted person to person, but through inhalation or aspiration of the Legionella bacteria," Dr Whiley said. "This is why it is important to wear a mask, wet down soil and wear gloves/wash hands when handling potting mix."

A more common source of legionnaires' disease is due to a different strain [species] of bacteria [_L. pneumophila_], usually found in contaminated air conditioning cooling systems on large buildings. In May this year [2022], 5 people were admitted to hospital after contracting legionnaires' disease after visiting Sydney's CBD. Health authorities suspected contaminated cooling towers spread the harmful
infection.

[Humans acquire legionnaires' disease after exposure to natural or human-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. Possible person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease has also been described (Correia AM, Ferreira JS, Borges V, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374: 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds.

More than 70% of cases of legionnaires' disease are due to _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand, where _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has accounted for only 45.7% of cases of community-acquired legionellosis and 30.4% are _L. longbeachae_ (Yu VL, Plouffe JF, Pastoris MC, et al. Distribution of _Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by culture in patients with sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: an international collaborative survey. J Infect Dis. 2002; 186(1): 127-8; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/186/1/127/837207).

Possible sources include aerosols generated from a _Legionella_-contaminated plumbing systems by showerheads, sink faucets, misters, decorative fountains, hot tubs/spas, car-wash facilities, as well as a building's cooling towers (structures that contain water and a fan as part of centralized air cooling systems), and even wastewater treatment plants. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

However, legionnaires' disease due to _L. longbeachae_ is associated with exposure to aerosols generated during the use of non-sterilized potting soil, which apparently contains free-living amoebae and elevated storage temperatures may foster the intra-amoebic growth of _L. longbeachae_ in the potting soil (Ross IS, Mee BJ, Riley TV. _Legionella longbeachae_ in Western Australian potting mix. Med J Aust. 1997; 166(7): 387; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.5694/j.1326-5377.1997.tb123175.x).

New South Wales (NSW) (pop., over 8 million residents in 2021) is a state on the east coast of Australia; New South Wales' state capital is Sydney, Australia's most populous city (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales).
