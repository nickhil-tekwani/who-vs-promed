Indonesian province plans to kill 170,000 dogs to battle rabies
The Indonesian province of East Nusa Tenggara plans to kill more than
170,000 dogs in a campaign to stamp out a rabies epidemic that has claimed
at least eight lives, a report said Friday. The head of the provincial
livestock office T.H. Salean said Thursday an investigation launched by the
health ministry in April confirmed dogs carrying rabies were responsible for
the deaths, the Jakarta Post reported. The mass extermination will be
carried out in East Flores, where local regent Henke Mukin said the disease
would otherwise soon spread to neighboring islands.
"We anticipate that there will be protests from the community, but there is
really no other way. If we don't, more people will die," he was quoted as
saying by Antara news agency. "We understand that people may feel disgusted
about this but which is better: killing the dogs or letting humans die
because of the rabies carried by the dogs," he added. Before the probe,
officials were puzzled by what they called 'mad dog disease' as victims
sometimes survived for as long as a month. Rabies victims normally die one
week after being bitten, Salean said in April. East Nusa Tenggara is 920
miles east of Jakarta and has a population of about 4 million people.

In 1985-87, I worked with the Animal Disease Investigation Centre at
Yogyakarta, Indonesia (one of at least a half dozen such centres in the
country). At that time, both East and West Nusa Tengara were free of rabies,
as well as Bali and the eastern third of the island of Java (East Java).
Nevertheless, the constant movement of small boats among the 13,000 islands
of the Indonesian archipelago certainly makes the entry of rabies into new
territories possible.
In 1986, we investigated an epidemic of rabies in Central Java; rabies is
endemic in West Java, and we were trying to stop its spread into East Java
and hence across into Bali, where the relaxed attitude towards dogs would
make stopping the epidemic very difficult. In the epidemic area, while the
incidence of rabies was higher in stray dogs vs domestic dogs (Relative Risk
= 3), most rabid bites actually came from domestic dogs, which far
outnumbered strays; multiple biting dogs were more often rabid than single
biters. 90% of the rabid dogs died within a week after showing clinical
signs. A few dogs lived longer than 14 days, and at least one dog -
reportedly not showing any clinical signs other than having bitten someone -
was killed after 14 days and was positive for rabies based on histology and
Fluorescent Antibody Test. (see Preventive Veterinary Medicine 1990; 8:295
-303).
