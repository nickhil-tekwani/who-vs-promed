The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) said that Kano, Plateau, Bauchi, Gombe, Nasarawa, Kaduna and Niger states have reported confirmed human cases of avian influenza H5N1, also called "bird flu." The NCDC Director-General, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on Tuesday [6 Apr 2021] in Abuja, while providing highlights of the epidemiological situation and response activities in Nigeria.

NAN reports that avian influenza is strains of the influenza virus that primarily infect birds but can also infect humans. This type of flu is most often contracted by contact with sick birds and can also be passed from person to person. It spreads by airborne respiratory droplets (coughs or sneezes).

Symptoms begin within 2 to 8 days and are like the common flu. Cough, fever, sore throat, muscle aches, headache and shortness of breath may occur.

Ihekweazu said as of 24 Mar 2021, the 7 states reported outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) cases (H5N1) in poultries. "Health National Rapid Response Team (RRT) from NCDC and the Federal Ministry of Agriculture were deployed to Bauchi, Kano and Plateau states.

"A total of 83 human samples were received and 64 (87.7%) samples were tested. Of the tested samples, 7 (10.9%) were positive for flu A, [and of those 7], 6 (85.7%) were subtype A/H5, while one (14.3%) was unsubtypable," he explained.

The NCDC boss said official notification about the outbreak had been conveyed to the World Health Organisation (WHO) as required by the International Health Regulations (IHR). He added that an official report had also been sent to the authorities at both the federal level and the affected states.

"Avian influenza outbreak emergency operations centre (EOC) at level 1 has been activated at national and in 2 states (Plateau and Gombe). Seven confirmed samples have been shipped to the WHO collaborating centre (WHO-CC) in the United States (US) for further characterisation," he noted.

Speaking on the response activities, he said the 2nd session of EOC had been conducted with a review of the outbreak situation, response terms of reference (TORs) and incident actions plan (IAPs).

"Seven states -- Kano, Plateau, Bauchi, Gombe, Kaduna, Nasarawa and Niger states -- have confirmed cases of avian influenza among poultry. Two states have reported 7 cases among humans: Kano, 4, and Plateau, 3. Only Kano, Plateau, Bauchi and Gombe states have had human contacts of birds followed up," he said.

According to him, of the 83 contacts reported, 27 contacts are from 3 local government areas (LGAs): Nasarawa, Ungogo and Gwale in Kano State. The others are 18 contacts from 2 LGAs (Jos North and South) in Plateau; 19 contacts from 2 LGAs (Bauchi and Toro) in Bauchi State, and 19 contacts from 3 LGAs (Kaltungo, Yamaltu Deba and Gombe) in Gombe State.

Ihekweazu stated that all contacts were farmers, farmworkers, bird handlers and traders, adding that the contacts were still asymptomatic except one who presented catarrh.

"A total of 83 humans nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples have been collected from contacts of confirmed birds in 4 states: Kano (27), Plateau (18), Bauchi (19) and Gombe (19). A total of 13 blood samples have also been collected from the very-close contacts (human) of the birds in 3 states: Plateau (3), Bauchi (5), and Gombe (5).

"Of 83 human samples collected, 64 (87.7%) samples were analysed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Of 64 samples analysed, only 7 (10.9%) were positive for Flu A. Of the 7 samples positive for Flu A, only 6 (85.7%) were positive for A/H5 while one (14.3%) was unsubtypable. All 7 positive samples have been shipped to WHO-CC for further lab analysis," he said.

The NCDC boss noted that sensitisation was carried out by the national and state RRT to farm owners, workers, live bird market (LBM) associations and communities in the affected states. He added that biosecurity measures were extensively discussed for the benefit of the farmers and communities.

[Based on the above report, A/H5 (N subtype not determined as yet) influenza has been reported in human samples from 7 states in Nigeria following outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) cases (H5N1) in poultry in the last week of March 2021. HPAI virus (HPAIV) H5N1 was first officially reported in Africa in 2006; thereafter, this virus has spread rapidly from Nigeria to 11 other African countries. Nigeria confirmed its 1st human case of avian flu A/H5N1 in January 2007 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5682264/). Recent reported data indicate that there is co-circulation/endemicity of multiple subtypes of avian influenza viruses (H5N8, H5N6 and H9N2) in the country, which can present diagnostic challenges as well (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2020.1757999). Influenza presents a constant example where joint activities by public health and animal health sectors vis-a-vis "One Health" actions are required to strengthen surveillance efforts and to contain and monitor virus spread and the emergence of novel viruses of animal and public health concern.

When avian influenza viruses are circulating in an area, the people involved in specific high-risk tasks, such as sampling sick birds, culling and disposing of infected birds, eggs, and litter, and cleaning of contaminated premises, should be trained on how to protect themselves and on proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE). People involved in these tasks should be registered and monitored closely by local health authorities for 7 days following the last day of contact with poultry or their environments.

Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.

Thorough investigation of all potential novel influenza human infections is warranted. All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR), and State Parties to the IHR are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by a new influenza A subtype with the potential to cause a pandemic (please see case definitions for diseases requiring notification under the IHR). Evidence of illness is not required.

For further information and details, please see:
- Current technical information including monthly risk assessments at the Human-Animal Interface WHO
- Case definitions for diseases requiring notification under the IHR (2005)
- International Health Regulations IHR (2005)
- Manual for the laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of influenza (2011)
- Terms of Reference for National Influenza Centers of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System

Since late December 2020, 4 HPAI H5N1 outbreaks have been reported in Nigeria's poultry, of which the 1st one affected a backyard holding, while the last 3 involved commercial or semi-commercial poultry farms. The single, thus far, follow-up report (No. 1), addressing 3 outbreaks, was submitted to the OIE on 15 Feb 2021; it includes a map and is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=38247. All infected flocks were culled.

Human-to-human infection by HPAI H5N1 is not common and sporadically recorded in Asian countries and Egypt. - Mod.AS

The ongoing avian influenza outbreak in poultry has now led to human cases in Kano, Plateau, Bauchi, Gombe, Nasarawa, Kaduna, and Niger states. This is not surprising with the large poultry farms and other smallholdings in the affected states. Kano, Plateau, and Bauchi states reported cases of avian influenza in poultry earlier in 2021 (see ProMED-EAFR post Avian influenza - Nigeria (02): poultry, H5N1, OIE 20210218.8197059). - Mod.AA
