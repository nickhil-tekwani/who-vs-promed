Three new measles cases have been diagnosed in Melbourne, with warnings issued for Melbourne Airport and a popular restaurant in the city's southeast.

On Tuesday [10 Dec 2019], Victoria's chief health officer Dr Brett Sutton confirmed the 3 new cases were recently diagnosed, and those infected had travelled on trams and planes and played futsal.

A woman in her 50s is being treated in the hospital, another woman, aged in her 30s, is recovering at home, and a man in his 30s is also recovering at home.

Victoria's chief health officer has released a list of the public sites where the infected trio had visited.

The 3 cases are unrelated.

A deadly measles outbreak that has gripped Samoa is triggering concerns about low vaccination rates in Hawaii.

The state Department of Health said Tuesday [10 Dec 2019] it is "definitely concerned" with the immunization rate of students starting public school.

Measles vaccination rates need to be at 93% to 95% of the population to prevent measles from spreading, experts said. But in Hawaii, only 91.5% of the state's kindergartners received the measles vaccine.

"We send out notices to our provider community to make sure they vaccinate their patients in a timely manner," said Janice Okubo, communications director for the DOH, in an email to Hawaii News Now. "We provide information and notices to get parents to vaccinate their children."

The state Department of Education added that students must meet immunization requirements before they're allowed to start school. But exemptions are granted for medical or religious reasons. In those cases, parents must provide documentation to the school.

As of April [2019], officials reported that 8 schools had 30% or more of their students unvaccinated.

In a follow-up on the world's largest measles outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) measles outbreak continues to grow and expand.

Since the beginning of the year through 2 Dec [2019], a total of 269 079 suspected measles cases, including 5430 deaths (CFR 2%), have been reported from all 26 provinces in the DRC.

Since 11 Nov [2019], 53 new health zones have confirmed epidemics.

This outbreak has already caused more deaths compared to the ongoing Ebola virus disease outbreak.

WHO notes that in addition to DRC, several other countries in the African region are also experiencing measles outbreaks. The underlying factor for the measles outbreaks in the African region is the inability of the vaccine administration systems to reach vulnerable children, rather than low uptake of the vaccines by the recipients, an increasing phenomenon seen in the developed world.

Some of the reasons for the low immunization coverage in the African region include inadequacies in the healthcare systems and social dislocation due to armed conflicts, poverty, other disasters, etc.

[8] Georgia (Cobb County): travel associated
Date: Wed 11 Dec 2019
Source: WABE [abridged, edited]
https://www.wabe.org/5-unreported-cases-started-cobb-county-measles-outbreak/


The recent Cobb County measles outbreak began in October [2019] with 5 cases that were not reported to public health officials.

Health officials didn't learn of the October [2019] cases -- all within one family -- until they began investigating the 6 additional cases that emerged in November [2019] in the suburban Atlanta county.

Dozens of local and state public health officials mobilized to contain the outbreak, the largest in the state in decades.

The board of the Department of Public Health on Tuesday [10 Dec 2019] was given details of the steps the agency took to address the Cobb outbreak. Amid the reported cases in November [2019], state Public Health identified more than 2500 people, through school or healthcare facility or other means, who were exposed to those individuals. Families were informed of the risk by letter or email and told to monitor possible symptoms.

Public Health had ''daily phone calls to multiple families,'' said Dr. Kathleen Toomey, public health commissioner. At a Cobb middle school that an infected individual attended, students who were unvaccinated were told not to go to school.

Fifty individuals were considered "susceptible'' for contracting measles, most of them infants too young to get the MMR vaccine, which is highly effective in preventing the disease. They received active daily monitoring.

Once public health officials took steps to contain the problem, no secondary cases emerged.

Board chairman Dr. James Curran said the anti-vaccine movement -- a diverse array of people who claim vaccines are dangerous -- has led to substantial public health harm for communities.

Drenzek said the 5 unreported October [2019] cases indirectly led to the 6 others in Cobb. The medical provider did not tell public health officials of those 5 cases, as is required under state law. Like many measles cases, the 5 contracted the disease after travel.

Nationally, there have been 1276 measles cases this year [2019] through early December [2019], by far the highest number since 1994; 3/4 of them were connected to New York outbreaks.

Most cases and outbreaks were related originally to international travel or travelers, followed by further spread in the US among pockets of unvaccinated people.

Recent global data show measles cases are up 30% from 2017, including 140 000 deaths, mostly in children under 5 years old.

In all, 18 individuals -- all unvaccinated -- had measles this year [2019] in Georgia. No cases occurred during the 3 prior years.

Drenzek said Tuesday [10 Dec 2019] that she believed the Cobb outbreak had been contained.

About 2% of the children enrolled in Georgia schools are unvaccinated, state officials say. Their families received a medical or religious exemption from the state's vaccine requirement.

[9] Vaccination: pre-travel
Date: Tue 10 Dec 2019

http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/12/kids-traveling-abroad-often-forgo-measles-vaccine-study-finds


Though most US babies and preschool-age children are eligible to receive the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine before traveling abroad, nearly 60% weren't vaccinated before departing, revealing missed opportunities by doctors, a research team based at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) reported yesterday [Mon 9 Dec 2019].

Since measles was eliminated in the US in 2000, outbreaks have been linked to people who contracted the virus in other countries, half of them in US residents returning home.

The US has reported 1276 cases so far this year [2019], the most since 1992, with the majority of illnesses linked to a few large outbreaks triggered by international travelers. Some of the outbreaks lasted several months, which threatened the nation's measles elimination status.

Though children make up only 10% of US international travelers, they account for nearly half of imported measles cases. Recognizing the risk of infection that young unvaccinated travelers face and their outsized threat of spreading the disease once they arrive home, special MMR recommendations for young international travelers have been in place since 1989.

To see how well doctors follow recommendations for young international travelers, researchers looked at the records of more than 14 000 pediatric travelers who were seen for pre-travel health visits at Global TravEpiNet sites, a consortium supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 2009-2018. They published their findings in JAMA Pediatrics.

Typically, children receive 2 MMR doses, the 1st between 12 and 15 months and the 2nd between 4 and 6 years. Due to the risk of international measles exposure, babies ages 6-12 months old who will travel are recommended to get vaccinated earlier and receive one dose before departure, with preschoolers advised to have received both lifetime doses before they leave.

Of the children seen at the clinics, 92% of infants and 60% of preschool-age kids were eligible for MMR vaccination, but 44% of babies and 57% of preschoolers weren't vaccinated, usually, because the clinicians didn't recognize that the children were eligible. In many instances, the children's' guardians also didn't want them vaccinated.

The study found that only 3% of school-aged travelers were eligible for vaccination, which researchers said points to overall high vaccine coverage. However, that group wasn't typically vaccinated due to guardian refusal, even though there were several measles outbreaks and robust media coverage of them.

Regina LaRocque, MD, PhD, senior author of the study who is with the MGH Division of Infectious Diseases, said in an MGH press release, "This underscores the knowledge gaps that exist about MMR vaccination, even among clinicians with expertise in travel medicine."

The group wrote that more study is needed to determine why clinicians didn't identify MMR-eligible kids or did not administer the vaccine, which they said would help educate providers and improve implementation of vaccination recommendations for young travelers.

Researchers concluded that clinicians have a role to play in discussing the risks of contracting measles abroad and how serious the disease can be. "Clinicians are trusted sources of information about vaccinations and should take advantage of every opportunity to address vaccine effectiveness, even in the context of previous vaccine refusal," they wrote.

Abstract

Importance. The US population is experiencing a resurgence of measles, with more than 1000 cases during the 1st 6 months of 2019. Imported measles cases among returning international travelers are the source of most US measles outbreaks, and these importations can be reduced with pretravel measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination of pediatric travelers. Although it is estimated that children account for less than 10% of US international travelers, pediatric travelers account for 47% of all known measles importations.

Objective. To examine clinical practice regarding MMR vaccination of pediatric international travelers and to identify reasons for nonvaccination of pediatric travelers identified as MMR eligible.

Conclusions and Relevance. Although most infant and preschool-aged travelers evaluated at GTEN [Global TravEpiNet] sites were eligible for pretravel MMR vaccination, only 41.3% were vaccinated during pretravel consultation, mostly because of clinician decision or guardian refusal. Strategies may be needed to improve MMR vaccination among pediatric travelers and to reduce measles importations and outbreaks in the United States.

"Children who are most likely to need MMR vaccination before international travel are aged 6 months to school-age, because they won't have yet received their complete MMR vaccinations routinely," explains Emily Hyle, MD, investigator in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital. "Measles poses serious health risks to people who are infected while abroad, as well as to those in communities to which they return. These risks can be greatly reduced or even eliminated via MMR vaccination prior to departure. Our study suggests the urgent need for greater awareness of the benefits of MMR vaccination for international travelers by pediatricians, as well as by guardians who may fail to recognize measles as a serious illness." - Mod.LK]
