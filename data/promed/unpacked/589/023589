Imported case of Lassa fever in United Kingdom
----------------------------------------------
The diagnosis of Lassa fever in a British soldier recently returned
from duty in rural Sierra Leone has been confirmed by virological
tests performed at the Enteric, Respiratory and Neurological Virus
Laboratory at the Central Public Health Laboratory, London, United
Kingdom. He had been based in an area endemic for Lassa fever. He is
currently being treated at the high-security infectious diseases unit
at Coppetts Wood Hospital, London. This is the sixth case of Lassa
fever to have been imported to the United Kingdom since 1976.

Lassa fever in a UK soldier recently returned from Sierra Leone
--------------------------------------------------
A case of Lassa fever has been confirmed in a British soldier
returned from Sierra Leone, West Africa, it is reported in 3 press
releases issued today by the Public Health Laboratory Service in
London, the Royal Free Hampstead Hospital in London, and the
Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, and Birmingham Public Health
Officials. The man, who became ill on Thu 30 Jan 2003, is being cared
for at a high-security infectious diseases unit in London and is in a
stable condition.
Since 1970, there have been at least 16 cases of Lassa fever imported
into Europe or North America; in none of these has onward
transmission to another person been reported.
From cases of person-to-person spread that have occurred in
developing countries, it is clear that people are only infectious
while symptoms are present or in the period of convalescence, and
then only through direct contact with bodily fluids. No such
transmission has occurred in the United Kingdom (UK). However, in
accordance with established guidelines in the UK, the patient is
being treated in a high-security infectious diseases unit. As a
precaution, close contacts of the patient including hospital staff
involved in the patient's care, and particularly those who have had
contact with the patient's bodily fluids, will be monitored by
occupational health staff and given advice about their level of risk,
which is low.
This follows a previous case in a British aid worker in Sierra Leone
(1), a case imported from Sierra Leone to the Netherlands (2), and 2
cases imported to Germany from Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire, all in 2000
(3).

[Lassa fever virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_, a group
of negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with bisegmented
genomes. Arenaviruses occur throughout the world, their distribution
being determined by their natural reservoir hosts, primarily rodents.
Arenaviruses are associated with only 2 of the 30 families of
rodents; the _Muridae_ (house mice and rats) and the _Cricetidae_
(voles, deer mice, and gerbils). They are maintained within their
rodent hosts in a chronic carrier state; in the case of Lassa fever
virus, long-term viremia and little signs of disease. Most arenavirus
species occur in the New World and a few (_Guarito virus_, _Junin
virus_, _Machupo virus_, and _Sabia virus_) are associated with
severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans. 5 arenavirus species are present
in the Old World, only 2 of which are associated with human disease:
_Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus_ (LCMV) and _Lassa fever virus_.
LCMV occurs worldwide and causes mild to severe disease, whereas
Lassa fever virus occurs only in West Africa (Sierra Leone and
Nigeria) and is associated with severe, often fatal infection of
humans. The rodent reservoir of Lassa fever virus is _Mastomys
natalensis_, an animal which inhabits human dwellings and
surroundings. Rodent-to-human is the predominant route of
transmission of infection in human victims and probably occurs via
aerosols or contact with rodent fluids and detritus. Less frequently
human-to-human transmission can occur also in natural and hospital
settings, probably because of the high aerosol stability of the
virus; hence the need for high-security containment in hospital
environments. - Mod.CP]
