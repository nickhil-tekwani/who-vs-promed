Emerging norovirus strain triggers gastroenteritis outbreaks in China
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The emerging norovirus genotype GII.17 was largely responsible for outbreaks of nonbacterial gastroenteritis in numerous Chinese cities during the 2014-15 winter season, according to recent data.

In the study, investigators responded to an increase in the number of norovirus outbreaks reported to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease.

Control and prevention in late 2014
-----------------------------------
These outbreaks consisted of at least 20 acute gastroenteritis cases within 3 days. The researchers tested samples from each outbreak for norovirus and intestinal bacteria. Samples that tested positive for norovirus were genotyped, and between 5 and 10 samples per outbreak were randomly identified for sequencing. The researchers defined the major causative norovirus genotype in each outbreak as the one detected in more than 80 percent of outbreak samples.

From November 2014 through January [2015], there were 29 outbreaks, including 2340 cases, reported. By comparison, there were 9 outbreaks and 949 cases during the previous winter, the researchers wrote. GenotypeGII.4/Sydney/2012 occurred in 48 percent of outbreaks between January 2013 and October 2014.

The 1st detection of GII.17 occurred in Guangzhou in November 2014 and subsequently spread quickly. Through January [2015], 10 cities within the Guangdong province reported GII.17 outbreaks, representing 83 percent of all outbreaks. After comparing sequences from archived strains of GII.17, the researchers said the genotype in Guangdong is a newly emerged variant that most closely resembles strains reported in Taiwan, Korea and Japan.

"The distribution of GII.17 genotype among patients with sporadic cases of gastroenteritis remains unknown," the researchers wrote. "In future studies, epidemiologic and virologic surveillance should be broadened to better clarify virologic, clinical, and epidemiologic patterns of this newly emerged norovirus."

More than 100 tourists have contracted norovirus infection after eating at a Green Island seafood restaurant off the coast of Taitung, Taiwan. According to Taiwanese health officials, the common link is tainted raw oysters from South Korea. According to the epidemiological investigation, 120 people had eaten raw oysters at the seafood restaurant. 102 tourists in 6 tour groups have displayed the symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea. More than 6 dozen people required hospitalization for their illness. The Taiwan Food and Drug Administration reports norovirus in both oyster and patient samples from the outbreak.

Norovirus is a highly contagious viral illness that often goes by other names, such as viral gastroenteritis, stomach flu, and food poisoning. The symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and some stomach cramping. Sometimes people additionally have a low-grade fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, and a general sense of tiredness. The illness often begins suddenly, and the infected person may feel very sick. In most people, the illness is self-limiting with symptoms lasting for about 1 or 2 days. In general, children experience more vomiting than adults do.

Norovirus is spread person to person particularly in crowded, closed places. Norovirus is typically spread through contaminated food and water, touching surfaces or objects contaminated with norovirus and then putting your hand or fingers in your mouth and close contact with someone who is vomiting or has diarrhea.

[On 16 Jul 2015, Taiwan's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported that a diarrhea outbreak among 102 tourists on Green Island off the coast of Taitung was caused by a norovirus infection. The tourists ate at a local seafood restaurant that served contaminated raw oysters imported from South Korea. The FDA then traced the source of the contaminated oysters and found they were among a total of 16 447.5 kilograms (36 260.5 lb) of raw oysters imported from South Korea by 2 aquaculture companies in New Taipei and Kaohsiung, Taiwan (http://barfblog.com/2015/07/raw-still-risky-102-sickened-with-norovirus-in-oysters-at-taiwan-restaurant/).

Food poisoning acquired from eating oysters infected with norovirus is still common. Seafood is responsible for an important proportion of foodborne illness and outbreaks worldwide. Many norovirus outbreaks have been traced to food that was handled by one infected person. Consumption of raw shellfish and oysters poses a risk of food poisoning. Thorough cooking to an internal temperature of 90 deg C (194 deg F) for 90 seconds can kill norovirus.

Summary
-------
Epidemiological investigations of outbreaks of hepatitis A virus (HAV) and norovirus (NoV) infections in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) in the last 5 years have highlighted frozen berries as a vehicle of infection. Given the increasing berry consumption in the EU over the last decades, we undertook a review of the existing evidence to assess the potential scale of threat associated with this product. We searched the literature and 4 restricted-access online platforms for outbreak/contamination events associated with consumption of frozen berries. We performed an evaluation of the sources to identify areas for improvement. The review revealed 32 independent events (i.e. outbreak, food contamination) in the period 1983-2013, of which 26 were reported after 2004. The identified pathogens were NoV, HAV and _Shigella sonnei_.

NoV was the most common and implicated in 27 events with over 15 000 cases reported. A capture-recapture analysis was performed including 3 overlapping sources for the period 2005-2013. The study estimated that the event-ascertainment was 62 percent. Consumption of frozen berries is associated with increasing reports of NoV and HAV outbreaks and contamination events, particularly after 2003. A review of the risks associated with this product is required to inform future prevention strategies. Better integration of the available communication platforms and databases should be sought at EU/EEA level to improve monitoring, prevention and control of food-borne-related events.

Discussion of contamination events
----------------------------------
We reviewed contamination events of food-borne pathogens in frozen berries. The review combined different sources such as scientific literature and restricted access EU platforms. With the exclusion of one event associated with contamination with _Shigella sonnei_, events were due to contamination with NoV (27 events) and HAV (4 events).

We identified 32 contamination events in a 30-year period, of which 26 occurred after 2004. This rise in number of reported outbreaks of NoV and HAV associated with consumption of frozen berries could be due to several concomitant factors. Increased likelihood of reporting over time and development of appropriate online platforms need to be considered alongside possible boosted interest in the scientific community. Technical developments in the detection of pathogens in food have resulted in the identification of implicated food vehicles with an increased accuracy over time. The evolving molecular typing techniques have allowed matching food and human isolates and the identification of large multinational outbreaks sharing a common source. The increase of RASFF notifications for contaminated frozen berries provides additional evidence on the rise in large contamination events. In 2013, several RASFF notifications were linked to a large multinational HAV outbreak associated with mixed frozen berry consumption in Italy and 12 additional EU/EEA countries. This indicates the extensive environmental and trace back investigations performed by the affected countries when experiencing a large food-borne outbreak.

Liberalisation of markets and increased consumption of 'healthy' and raw food, such as berries, has increased the production and subsequently the risk of exposure to NoV and HAV for the EU population [6]. In 2013, 3 RASFF notifications for NoV contaminated berries were issued following border or other routine food safety controls. This might have been related to the EU regulation issued by the EC in 2012 to intensify the level of official controls on imports of specific food items of non-animal origin, including checks for NoV and HAV in strawberries from China.

Our review highlights the higher frequency of NoV outbreaks compared with HAV in the EU/EEA in the past decades. Although the 2 viruses share some common features, such as low dose infectivity and ability for long survival in the environment, HAV appears to be associated with a lower number of reported cases. This may be due in part to prevalence of individuals with long-lasting immunity after infection or vaccination, a high proportion of asymptomatic HAV infections or, alternatively, to challenging recognition of outbreaks and their association with a particular food item due to the long HAV incubation period and recall bias.

Our review identified one single event associated with Shigella in 1996. Although this does not appear to be a common health risk associated with the consumption of frozen berries, prevention and control measures should also include this pathogen.

There were some limitations in our study approach. We did not perform a systematic review of the available evidence. Hence some records may have not been retrieved. The manual record-linkage based on multiple variables may have resulted in imprecise estimates of the number of independent events reported in the study period. In addition, the number of human cases associated with each event may be affected by considerable under-reporting, typical of self-limiting gastrointestinal diseases and of asymptomatic manifestation of disease.

The different periods during which the sources have been operating and the different reporting practices may have impacted on the information retrieval, especially in the earlier decades. Comparison was also limited, as some of the EU-based platforms were introduced from 2005 onwards. Moreover, while reporting to the RASFF or EFSA database is mandatory for EU Member States, this is not the case for the other sources included in the analysis, resulting in reporting or publication bias. A more in-depth analysis of the grey literature such as national public health institutes reports, may have allowed more events to be retrieved, including a larger fraction of outbreaks with a national dimension, particularly from earlier years covered by our review.

The route by which fresh and frozen berries become contaminated is not fully understood. The 3 pathogens causing the outbreaks are likely to come from human sources. Manually picked fruits such as soft berries are at great risk of viral contamination if the quality of farming practices, e.g. worker hygiene during farming and harvesting, is insufficient. Contamination may also derive from poor quality irrigation water and spraying of berry crops [3,7,17,34]. Frozen as compared with fresh berries, may lead to larger scale contamination due to processing routines such as mixing batches of different origin during freezing and before packaging. As contamination of raspberries with different NoV genotypes has been documented, large batches of product for export may come from different farms [2,3,14,17]. The consequently uneven distribution of contaminated berries may result in poor detection of viruses in food samples undergoing routine food safety checks. The detection of these viruses in contaminated food vehicles is further hampered by the absence of a robust, quantitative method for sampling, concentration and analysis, the low levels of contamination and the effect of inhibitory materials for RT-PCR detection [3,26,27,35-37]. These factors may have impacted on the capacity to identify, and subsequently report, outbreaks or contamination events involving frozen berries, particularly in the earlier decades of the study period.

Although the size of berry farms varies broadly across the EU, small-scale farming is common. Together with wild-picked berries, berries from these farms have been considered to be more vulnerable for HAV and NoV contamination. Nevertheless, there is no evidence of association between farm size and risk of contamination. In addition, small-scale production, as well as inadequate labelling of the site of production, impacts the traceability of batches from wholesalers to the farm level. According to several studies, decontamination of berries proves difficult as the ability to survive of enteric viruses on frozen berries is quite long, with marginal reduction of the infectivity even after several months of storage [39,40]. Considering the long shelf-life and the wide distribution of these products, contaminated batches may result in a long-term source of outbreaks of a national or multinational size. In consideration of this, and due to repeated NoV and HAV outbreaks related to frozen berries, some countries have implemented risk communication interventions and recommended to heat-treat frozen berries before use, for 1 to 3 minutes.

In addition, to enhance the detection, control and investigation of outbreaks due to contaminated berries, and to support the assessment of the health risks, a better integration of the available communication platforms and databases should be sought at EU/EEA level to improve coordinated data collection and reporting.
