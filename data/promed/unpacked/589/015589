Possible foot-and-mouth case in pigs
------------------------------------
A suspected outbreak of foot-and-mouth [FMD] has been discovered in pigs
brought to a factory in Carlow.
The animals were discovered by Department of Agriculture inspectors at
Ballon Meats in the town last night.
The factory was closed off, with no further movement of animals or meat in
or out of the premises allowed.
The farm from where the pigs came from has also been closed to further
movements.
Preliminary test results are expected today with fuller confirmation within
92 hours.

Foot and Mouth Test Results Expected
-------------------------------------
A British laboratory which is testing samples from pigs in Carlow for foot
and mouth disease is expected to deliver preliminary results today.
The animals were discovered with suspicious symptoms by Department of
Agriculture veterinary inspectors at Ballon Meats in Carlow yesterday. The
factory was closed off, while the farm which supplied the pigs was also closed.
The pigs were slaughtered and samples were sent to a British laboratory in
Pirbright, Surrey.
The Department of Agriculture said the laboratory was able to carry out a
range of tests not available in Ireland.
"Its a precautionary measure," said a spokesman.
He said the preliminary results of the tests would be available later today.
"If it turns out to be positive, we would have to take appropriate action
to prevent a possible spread."
In March 2001, severe restrictions were imposed after a single case of FMD
was discovered in the Cooley Peninsula in County Louth.
A ban on angling was imposed and the St Patricks Day parade in Dublin was
cancelled, along with Ireland's Six Nations rugby match against England.
The World Organisation for Animal Health restored Ireland's FMD free status
in September 2001.
The Carlow Farmers Hunt, which was due to hold its annual point to point
race in Ballon tomorrow, has cancelled it as a precautionary measure.
The Department of Agriculture said it did not expect to receive the results
of the tests on the samples until tomorrow.

[Clinically suspected cases of FMD are not that rare and may occur
sporadically in most FMD-free countries. Immediate reporting and rapid
laboratory investigation are required, while in the meantime precautionary
measures are applied to prevent potential spread, even before the lab
results are obtained. Let's hope this remains another false alarm. - Mod. AS].
