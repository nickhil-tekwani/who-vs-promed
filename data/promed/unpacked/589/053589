Official: It's Too Late to Stop Citrus Greening
-----------------------------------------------
Now that the fatal citrus greening disease [Huanglongbing (HLB)] has spread
to 2 commercial citrus groves, including one of the state's largest
growers, the prospects for eradicating the disease may have vanished.
"We can't eradicate the disease at this point, in my opinion,'' Craig
Meyer, Florida's deputy commissioner of agriculture, told The Ledger after
a Friday [14 Oct 2005] morning meeting on efforts to control the bacterial
disease that has spread to 5 counties in less than 2 months. "Our objective
is to develop a set of best management practices for the industry to allow
growers to control this disease.''
Meyer's remarks came at the end of the meeting of more than 20 officials
from the state and U.S. departments of agriculture at the Citrus Research
and Education Center in Lake Alfred. Jim Graham, a soil microbiologist at
the center, agreed the prospects for eradicating the disease are bleak. "I
think the cow's out of the barn,'' said Graham, who added the industry
needs to focus on management practices to control the spread of HLB,
particularly in citrus nurseries.
Others at the meeting declined to give up on eradication. "We haven't come
to that conclusion yet,'' said Michael Shannon, the director of plant
health for the USDA Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service in Gainesville.
Greening is caused by a bacterium that lives in a variety of hosts,
including citrus trees and ornamental plants, for up to 3 years before
symptoms appear. Common symptoms include mottling on leaves, which also
take on a yellowish green color.
HLB always kills a citrus tree eventually, but before that, it retards
fruit growth and gives the juice a salty, bitter taste. It's called
"greening'' because the bottom of the fruit remains green.
Officials believe that HLB came to Florida through infected plant material
imported from areas where the disease is prevalent, including Asia, Africa
and Brazil. Once established, the citrus psyllid, an insect that also
serves as a host, appears to be the main factor in its spread.
Whatever the prospects for controlling HLB, meeting participants agreed
Florida citrus growers are clamoring for information on how to identify
greening symptoms and what to do if they find them. Their demands likely
will grow now that HLB has spread to 2 commercial groves in Hendry and Palm
Beach counties. Since the 1st confirmed discovery of HLB near Homestead in
late August 2005, state and federal inspectors have found HLB on more than
200 residential trees in Miami-Dade, Broward and Martin counties.
But inspectors on Tuesday [11 Oct 2005] confirmed HLB on 6 trees over 4
square miles in a Hendry grove owned by Southern Gardens Citrus processing
Corp., a Clewiston juice company, said Paul Hornby, a state agriculture
official supervising the HLB survey team. A subsidiary of U.S. Sugar,
Southern Gardens is one of the state's 5 largest growers, with more than 30
000 acres of grove.
Earlier this week [2nd week October 2005], inspectors also found HLB in 2
citrus trees on land owned by Callery Judge Grove of Loxahatchee in north
Palm Beach, Hornby said. Infections were found on an orange and a tangerine
tree about 5 miles apart in a 2000-acre grove, said Mark DuBois, Callery
Judge's production manager. HLB surfaced after 4 discoveries of canker
since June 2005 that will result in the loss of almost 1000 acres in the grove.
DuBois got few questions answered at the meeting because officials,
including leading state and federal agricultural researchers, indicated few
scientific studies on HLB exist. The few studies published offer no
effective ways to control the bacteria or the citrus psyllid.
"This is not a well characterized disease,'' said Philip Berger, the
national science program leader for molecular diagnostics and biotechnology
at the USDA office in Raleigh, North Carolina.

[The Asiatic or oriental citrus psyllid, _Diaphorina citri_ [Dc], is widely
distributed in southern Asia where it has been a major pest of citrus in
several countries, particularly India, where there has been a serious
decline of citrus in recent years. Dc had not been recorded to occur in
North America or Hawaii but was reported in Brazil, by Costa Lima (1942;
Rio de Janeiro) and Catling (1970). However, in June 1998, Dc was detected
in Florida, distributed along Highway 1 on the east coast of Florida, from
Broward to St. Lucie counties, but was apparently limited to dooryard host
plantings at the time of its discovery. By September 2000, Dc had spread to
31 counties in Florida (Halbert 2001). Dc and one of its parasites are also
present in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. Both species appear to have been
accidentally introduced in the spring of 2001 on potted _Murraya_
originating in Florida.
The fastidious bacterial pathogen _Serratia marcescens_ [Sm], which causes
HLB, exists in sieve tubes. Electron microscopy, using serial sections and
a 3-dimensional configuration confirms the presence of mature forms of the
pathogen, generally rigid rods with dimensions ranging from 0.25 to 0.5 by
0.8 to 4.0 micrometers. The cells are pleomorphic, and produce flexible
elongated rods which grow into new organisms. Multiplication is generally
accomplished by budding, less frequently by binary fission or beading.
Since 1988, cucurbit crops, particularly watermelon, cantaloupe, and squash
grown in Oklahoma and Texas have experienced devastating losses from
cucurbit yellow vine disease (CYVD), caused by Sm. Squash bug [ _Anasa
tristis_ ] is a putative vector of the pathogen. In 2000-01, overwintering
populations of the squash bug collected from DeLeon, TX were tested for
their ability to harbor and transmit Sm. Individual squash bugs (n = 76)
were caged for a 7-day period on a series of at least 4 squash seedlings. 3
studies were conducted, one with insects collected in November placed on
1st leaf-stage seedlings and the 2nd and 3rd with insects from an April
2001 collection placed on 3-5 leaf-stage squash. Controls consisted of
squash seedlings caged without insects. Squash bug transmission rates of
the pathogen in Studies I-III were, respectively 20, 9.1, and 3.6 percent.
Overall, 10.5 percent of the squash bugs harbored and successfully
transmitted the bacterium to squash seedlings. All control plants were
negative for CYVD symptoms or presence of Sm. Female squash bugs killed a
significantly greater proportion of young 1st leaf-stage seedlings than
males. Feeding on 3-5 leaf stage squash resulted in no plant mortality
regardless of squash bug gender. This study demonstrated that the squash
bug harbors Sm in its overwintering state. The squash bug/Sm overwintering
relationship greatly elevates the pest status of squash bug and places more
importance on development of integrated strategies for reducing potential
overwintering and emergent squash bug populations.
Dc is often referred to as "citrus psylla", but this is the same common
name often applied to _Trioza erytreae_, the psyllid pest of citrus in
Africa. To avoid confusion, _T. erytreae_ should be referred to as the
African citrus psyllid or the 2-spotted citrus psyllid (the latter name in
reference to a pair of spots on the base of the abdomen in late stage
nymphs). These 2 psyllids are the only known vectors of the etiologic agent
of citrus greening disease and are the only economic species on citrus in
the world. 3 other species of _Diaphorina_ have been reported on citrus (2
in Swaziland, one in India), but these are non-vector species of relatively
little importance.
Dc ranges primarily in tropical and subtropical Asia and has been reported
from the following geographical areas: China, India, Myanmar, Taiwan,
Philippine Islands, Malaysia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Thailand,
Nepal, Cecum, Hong Kong, Ryukyu Islands, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia,
Reunion, Mauritius, and Brazil. The discovery of Dc in Saudi Arabia (Wooler
et al., 1974) is the 1st record from the Near East. _T. erytreae_ also
occurs in Saudi Arabia, preferring the eastern and highland areas where the
extremes of climate are present, whereas Dc is widespread in the western,
more equitable coastal areas.
