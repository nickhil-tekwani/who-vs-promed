Ugandan hippo deaths from mysterious disease rise from 25 to 100: official
---------------------------------------------------
Some 100 hippos have died from a mysterious disease in southwestern
Uganda's Queen Elizabeth National Park in the past month, rising from
25 deaths reported a month ago, Ugandan Wildlife Authority (UWA)
official said on Sunday [12 Sep 2004].
"We have lost 100 hippos in the past one month, but the cause of
their deaths has not yet been established. We are still carrying out
tests," UWA board chairman John Nagenda told AFP.
"The leading theory is rinderpest and, should it be the disease, we
suspect it to have been caused by animals, especially cattle, that
had not been inoculated, but had entered the park in search for
pasture," Nagenda said, pointing out: "UWA had always discouraged
this." [If uninoculated cattle were the source of infection to
hippos, there should have been observable mortality in such cattle.
Generally, cattle are regarded to be more susceptible to rinderpest
than hippos. See also commentary below. - Mod.AS]
There are an estimated 4000 hippos in the country, the local weekly
Sunday Vision reported.
Reports reaching Kampala said the areas where the deaths were 1st
reported since 22 Aug 2004, are Katako, Kyambura River, Kashaka,
Kasenyi and Kazinga Channel on the northern shores of Lake Edward
bordering eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
Nagenda said that an exercise to inoculate all cattle near the parks
is going to be embarked on immediately, as actual results of tests on
the hippos are being awaited.

4 die after eating dead hippo's meat in western Uganda
-------------------------------------------------
4 people in western Uganda died recently after they reportedly ate a
dead hippo's meat, The New Vision newspaper reported on Monday [13
Sep 2004].
The dead, from Bunyaruguru county, Bushenyi district, ate the meat
after the hippo died of a strange disease. 3 more [who] ate [have
been] hospitalized at Rugazi Health Center, the report said. [Results
of postmortem investigations, if carried out, and of the clinical
observations and lab tests of the hospitalised patients, particularly
their response to antibiotic (penicillin?) treatment, will be
helpful. - Mod.AS]
Bushenyi district director of health services Charles Katurebe said
they were investigating the deaths.
Bunyaruguru county residents have always complained that hippos from
Queen Elizabeth National Park eat their crops.
A mysterious disease hitting Queen Elizabeth National Park in western
Uganda about a month ago has killed more than 100 hippos out of an
estimated 4000 to date.
The Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) dispatched an expert team made up
of people from the UWA, Makerere University, the Ministry of
Agriculture and an European Union supported disease control program
in mid-August to investigate the deaths.
However, the cause of the deaths remains a mystery.

[There is serologic evidence for the susceptibility of hippos to
infection with the rinderpest virus; however, no clear data on their
clinical susceptibility could be found. Readers who might have such
data are invited to forward them.
On the other hand, sickness and death in humans following the
consumption of meat from diseased animals might indicate a zoonosis,
most probably anthrax, or -- less likely -- a toxic agent. Rinderpest
does not affect humans.
One remark in the news item, namely that "Bunyaruguru county
residents have always complained that hippos from Queen Elizabeth
National Park eat their crops", might indicate that deliberate
poisoning is a possibility, though rather a remote one, in view of
the wide geographic spread of cases.
Results of the current investigations by the Ugandan/EU experts team,
or data on samples already obtained, will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
