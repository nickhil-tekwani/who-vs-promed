A massive house-to-house survey has begun in Darwin, as part of a campaign
aimed at eradicating grapevine leaf rust (GLR), a disease that threatens
Australia's $4.4 billion [about USD 2.7 billion] wine industry. Thousands
of homes with backyard vines will be visited in an attempt to stop the
disease spreading south and east, into the lucrative commercial vineyard areas.
20 teams visited homes in the suburb of Karama on 21 Apr 2003. The survey
will take in 30 000 homes in the Darwin region over the next 10 weeks. It
Ã­s hoped the survey will locate grapevines, one of the biggest tasks in a 3
year campaign to rid the northern capital of the devastating GLV.
The disease was discovered in 2001, and Darwin is the only area in
Australia where the rust has been found. The eradication campaign has
strong support from the wine and table grape industries, who fear the
aggressive disease could move south.

[There are obvious similarities between the attempts to eradicate GLR in
Darwin and those to eradicate the citrus canker [CC] bacterium
(_Xanthomonas axonopodis_ Starr & Garces emend. Vauterin, et al. pv.
_citri_ (Hasse) Dye [Xac] [syn. _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _citri_
(Hasse) Dye]) in Florida. There have been 3 outbreaks of CC in Florida. The
first was in 1910 in northern Florida. Eradication of the disease was
confirmed in 1933 and by 1947 the USA was declared CC-free. A second
outbreak occurred in 1986 in Hillsborough, Pinellas and Manatee counties
and declared eradicated in 1992. CC was detected for a third time in 1995,
however, near the Miami International Airport and additional confirmed
cases were announced in 1997, 1998, 2002, and March 2003. Under Florida
conditions, management of CC is predicated on eradication of exposed trees
within a radius of 1900 ft (about 600 metres) from infected trees, whether
in residential areas or commercial production areas. In areas where CC is
endemic, management depends on use of resistant cultivars, barriers such as
windbreaks to obstruct inoculum spread and application of copper-containing
bactericides. By 31 Dec 2002, 614 344 residential trees and 1 743 236
commercial citrus trees had been destroyed in Florida in the attempt to
eradicate the disease. A comprehensive reference is the following:
