Information on dead seals in 2007:
Status report No. 7: mild epidemic (15 Aug 2007)
------------------------------------------------
According to Tero Harkonen from the Swedish Museum of Natural
History, until 12 Aug 2007, 81 common seals were recorded to have
died as a result of PDV [phocine distemper virus]. Single dead seals
are reported practically daily from Tanum in the north to Ven in the
Oresund [a map is available at the source URL].
There are no positive cases reported from the northern large seal
colonies at Kosteroarna on the Swedish-Norwegian boarder and the
outer Oslo Fjord.
This implies that the virus is present in all local populations along
the Swedish Kattegat and Skagerrak coast without resulting in a
massive seals death. According to Harkonen, it seems to confirm the
1st prognosis of a death rate of about 300 common seals. This was
based on the assumption that almost 60 percent of the seals will be
immune after the 2002 epidemic, which is close to what is considered
the 66 percent benchmark at which the virus cannot cause an epidemic,
resulting in an almost complete immunity of seal populations.
The Museum is still waiting for the result from IAH [Institute for
Animal Health], England where the virus is being sequenced. As this
type of work is not routine and demands more advanced research, it is
difficult to say when the results will be available. In the coming
weeks regular aerial counts will be carried out along the Swedish
Kattegat and Skagerrak coast to determine whether the death rate
balances the number of registered stranded and incoming dead animals.
No unusual increase in mortality has been reported from the Wadden Sea.
