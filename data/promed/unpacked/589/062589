The Director of the Environmental Health Office in Zliten, Mohammed Abu Qamiza, confirmed on [Mon 9 Apr 2018] that the recorded cases of leishmaniasis this year [2018] has increased to 51 persons in the city [Zliten].

In a press statement, Abu Qamiza explained that there is no cure at the current time for the disease in Libya, noting that the cost of treatment for this disease is prohibitively expensive and could amount to 10 000 Libyan dinars per person [approx. 7547 USD].

He called on the Ministry of Health and the National Centre for Communicable Diseases to take the necessary action in order to contain the disease.

Earlier this month [April 2018], Zliten Municipality warned against the spread of leishmaniasis, declaring that 351 cases were recorded in the city in 2017.

Mayor Miftah Hammadi urged the government health officials in to contract a specialized company to combat the disease ahead of summer.

Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease spread to humans by bites of sandflies that are usually active from May to September each year.

[Zliten is a town in Murqub [Al Murqub or Al Marqab] District on the Mediterranean cost approximately 175 km (109 miles) east of Tripoli. We assume that the cases are cutaneous leishmaniasis.

A recent study mapping of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Libya concluded: "Future projection of CL until 2060 showed a trend of increasing incidence of CL in the north-western part of Libya, a spread along the coastal region and a possible emergence of new endemics in the north-eastern districts of Libya. These results should be considered for control programs to prevent the emergence of new endemic areas taking also into consideration changes in socio-economical factors such as migration, conflicts, urbanization, land use and access to health care" (Amro A, Al-Dwibe H, Gashout A et al.
