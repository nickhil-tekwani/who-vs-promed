On 2 Sep [2014], Romanian heath authorities reported 3 indigenous human cases of West Nile virus. Two cases were confirmed, and one was suspected in the districts of Mures, Vrancea and Olt. They are the 1st indigenous cases reported in 2014.

A surveillance of human and animal cases of West Nile virus has been implemented in the South of Romania since 1997 and 2008 in the district of Braila. Other cases were reported in 2012 and 2013.

Many factors contribute to the multiplication of mosquito vector diseases:
- climate: high temperatures and [significant] humidity due to abundant rain from May through September
- favorable natural site (Danube)
- presence of horses and migrating wild birds

[It is clear that West Nile virus (WNV) continues to move in Europe and cause neurological disease in humans and equine animals. Cases of WNV infection in humans have occurred sporadically over the past 18 years. The 2011 season was particularly active for WNV transmission in eastern Europe, including Romania. A report issued in 2008 (see ProMED-mail archive number 20080926.3042) and a serological survey of horses done in 2007 indicated that about half of a small number of animals sampled had WNV IgG antibody. However, there was no mention made of clinical cases in equine animals. There was a major outbreak in 1996, with 352 human cases reported (see ProMED-mail archive number 20010731.1499). The vector for West Nile virus present in Romania is _Culex_ spp. (_Cx. molestus / pipiens_), which is active from May to October each year. It would not be surprising if additional human cases occur until the transmission season ends in October [2014].
