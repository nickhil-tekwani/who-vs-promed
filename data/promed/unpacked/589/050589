The general directorate of livestock warned that any animal or batch of animals imported into the country must be certified by the nation of origin that it is free of diseases.

Through its director, Geovanny Molina, the institution reiterated the importance of the Dominican Republic maintaining and guaranteeing animal health in the national territory. He assured it is a mission that must be fulfilled, and it will always be done while adhering to due respect for norms and protocols, but without twisting its arm in the face of particular interests.

He specifically referred to the cases of bluetongue disease, after a quantity of 12 animals had been received at the Animal Forty Station of the Las Americas International Airport (AILA), imported from the United States, which, after rigorous analyzes were carried out, determined they were positive, so the institution proceeded accordingly.

"Bluetongue is a disease-causing ailment affecting ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats, and other animals. It does not affect humans," added Molina.

He explained that for animals entering the country, compliance with a quarantine is established, which must be rigorously complied with at the Airport of the Americas, since it is the only authorized entry point for live animals.

He specified in the case of sheep from the United States, the presence of bluetongue virus RNA was confirmed by the RT-PCR method and the presence of non-vaccine antibodies by the AGID method (test).

Meanwhile, Dagelia Gomez , director of animal health , explained that bluetongue disease is a disease of ruminants and camelids transmitted by _Culicoides_ vectors.

Details of the sheep entry process
The number of animals received at the AILA Animal Forty Station was 12 Dorper sheep. Tests were conducted at the United States National Veterinary Services Laboratories.

The method was RT-PCR, through which 2 were positive. The AGID method was also used, through which 7 positives were obtained.

The date of evidence collection by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories of the United States was 14 Feb 2022.

Joint tests were carried out at the Central Veterinary Laboratory (LAVECEN) of the Dominican Republic, an entity that has all the standards required for a topic such as the one described.

[Bluetongue virus (frequently shorted to bluetongue) is capable of inducing a severe hemorrhagic disease with high mortality in domestic and wild ruminants, including domestic sheep, cattle, goats, bighorn sheep (_Ovis canadensis_), white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_), and pronghorn antelope (_Antilocapra americana_).

The virus is carried by an insect, a biting midge (_Culicoides_ genus), and is particularly damaging in sheep; half the sheep in an infected flock may die. In cattle and goats, however, bluetongue viruses cause very mild, self-limiting infections with only minor clinical consequences. A bluetongue virus infection causes inflammation, swelling, and hemorrhage of the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and tongue. Inflammation and soreness of the feet also are associated with bluetongue. In sheep, the tongue and mucous membranes of the mouth become swollen and hemorrhagic and may look red or dirty blue in color, thus giving the disease its name.

Animals cannot directly contract the disease from other animals. - Mod.TG
