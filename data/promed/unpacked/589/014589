The state government [of Maharashtra] on Mon 24 Apr 2006 said the
Akola-based veterinary surgeon involved in culling operations in Jalgaon
had died of jaundice and not bird flu as reported by the press.
"There is no connection between the death of veterinary doctor Abdul Kalim
Khan and bird flu. He was suffering from jaundice. He was advised complete
bed rest. But he attended a marriage ceremony and his health deteriorated
further," state animal husbandry department commissioner Bijay Kumar said.
"He was admitted to the hospital immediately in a critical condition. He
was completely drained due to exhaustion. Even after repeated attempts, the
doctors could not revive him," Mr Kumar said.
He assured that there was no reason for anybody to believe that the
deceased doctor died after getting infected with the H5NL [H5N1?] virus.
"Since he was involved in the culling process, people are relating his
death with bird flu. There is still no case of bird flu infection in human
beings in the country," he said. According to the animal husbandry
commissioner, even the 3 samples from the deceased sent to National
Institute of Virology, Pune, have been declared negative.
