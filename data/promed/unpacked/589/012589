Multistate outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections
---------------------------------------------------
CDC, several states, the US Food and Drug Administration, and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service are investigating a multistate outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections. This investigation includes _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections recently reported by the New Jersey Department of Health.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _E. coli_ bacteria isolated from ill people using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE.

Illnesses reported by investigators in New Jersey also included ill people who had a diagnostic test showing they were infected with _E. coli_ bacteria. Laboratory testing is ongoing to link their illnesses to the outbreak using DNA fingerprinting. Some people may not be included in CDC's case count because no bacterial isolates are available for the DNA fingerprinting needed to link them to the outbreak.

As of 9 Apr 2018, 17 people infected with the outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 have been reported from 7 states. Illnesses started on dates ranging from 22 Mar 2018 to 31 Mar 2018. Ill people range in age from 12 to 84 years, with a median age of 41. Among ill people, 65 percent are female. 6 ill people have been hospitalized, including one person who developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure. No deaths have been reported.

State / Ill People
Connecticut / 2
Idaho / 4
Missouri / 1
New Jersey / 6
Ohio / 1
Pennsylvania / 2
Washington / 1
Total / 17

The investigation is still ongoing and a specific food item, grocery store, or restaurant chain has not been identified as the source of infections. State and local public health officials are interviewing ill people to determine what they ate and other exposures in the week before their illness started.

CDC will provide more information as it becomes available.

[ProMED awaits more information regarding this ongoing outbreak which was first reported from New Jersey and was possibly linked to a restaurant chain. This initial CDC report does not make that assertion. - Mod.LL
