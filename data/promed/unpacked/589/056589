Africa Cases Deaths

South Africa 1.II-30.IV (*1*)
(*1*) Cholera outbreak in South Africa
Between February and April 1998, 20 cholera cases and 1 death occurred in
migrant farm workers from a neighbouring country and inhabitants of Phiva
village, after contamination of the Lomati river in the Lowveld region of
Mpumalanga province.
Lowveld region is a predominantly rural area bordering Mozambique in the
east and Swaziland in the south. Domestic water supplies and sanitation on
most farms in the area are substandard and conducive to the spread of
waterborne infections.
Urgent steps were taken to avert a larger outbreak.
Sanitation facilities were constructed, and health education, in local
languages, was provided to farm workers. In Phiva village, a safe
alternative water supply from a reservoir was utilized, while the
implicated Lomati river treatment plant was decommissioned. A large-scale
community education campaign was also instituted.
No new cases have been reported since May 1998.
(Based on: A report from the Department of Health and Welfare, Mpumalanga
province.)

[This outbreak should have been reported by South Africa much earlier. Let
us hope that at least the "neighbouring country" was swiftly informed -
