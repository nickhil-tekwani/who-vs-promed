Zambia Post reported on 14 Nov 2007 that 6 villagers in Mongu
District in Zambia's Western Province were hospitalized after
contracting anthrax from diseased beef.

Along with other measures, the local government has provided vaccines
for domestic livestock and has urged local farmers not to panic,
saying it will work exhaustively to control the disease. Local
veterinary officials have advised residents not to eat meat from
diseased carcasses.

The report says that Mongu District health agency has requested the
central government to urgently dispatch 23 000 units of anthrax
vaccine for vaccination of livestock in villages surrounding the area
where anthrax was discovered to prevent a large scale outbreak.

[Our thanks to Dan for finding and translating this report via China.

Mongu in Western Zambia has long been enzootic for anthrax. And
unfortunately, reactive livestock vaccination will do little to
control this disease in the medium term, much less the long term. It
is an area with poor roads and weak infrastructure, and therefore the
District Veterinary Officers have problems responding to any reports
of livestock problems, and especially acute problems. Thus, we see
this situation, where response comes as a reaction to human cases. To
cost-effectively control livestock anthrax, one must have a program
of routine annual vaccination of at-risk herds and flocks. It is even
more efficient if there is surveillance for unexpected livestock
deaths so that they can be promptly investigated, whether due to
poisonings, blackleg, or even anthrax. - Mod MHJ]
