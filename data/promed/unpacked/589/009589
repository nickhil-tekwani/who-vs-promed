Cluster of wound botulism cases in injecting drug users in the United
Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland
--------------------------------
Since 1 Aug 2002, 6 cases of wound botulism in injecting drug users (IDUs)
have been reported by the Public Health Laboratory Service Food Safety
Microbiology Laboratory (PHLS FSML) in London (1). This brings the total
number of clinically diagnosed cases of wound botulism in IDUs reported in
the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland to 13 in 2002 (2, 3). The recent
cases may be caused by a batch of drugs contaminated with the anaerobic
bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. Reports of wound botulism in IDUs are a
relatively new phenomenon with no clinically diagnosed cases in the UK and
Republic of Ireland up to the end of 1999. There were, however, 6 reports
in 2000 and 4 in 2001 (4 and references therein, 5 and references therein).
Cases of wound botulism in Europe, although rare, continue to be reported.
In recent years reports of suspected botulism in IDUs have come from Norway
(6) and Switzerland (7).
Wound botulism occurs when spores of _C. botulinum_ contaminate a wound,
germinate, and produce botulinum toxin in vivo. The symptoms of botulism
are caused by the toxin, which blocks the release of acetycholine at the
neuromuscular junction resulting in a descending flaccid paralysis.
Patients with botulism may present with blurred vision, drooping eyelids,
slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness.
There is usually no fever, no loss of sensation and no loss of awareness.
If untreated, paralysis may progress to the arms, legs, trunk and
respiratory muscles. If onset is very rapid, there may be no symptoms
before sudden respiratory paralysis occurs. Clinicians should suspect
botulism in any patient with an afebrile, descending, flaccid paralysis.
Botulinum antitoxin is effective in reducing the severity of symptoms if
administered early in the course of the disease. _C. botulinum_ is
sensitive to benzyl penicillin and metronidazole. In cases of wound
infection, antimicrobial therapy and surgical debridement should reduce the
organism load and therefore toxin production, but circulating toxin can
only be neutralised by the early administration of antitoxin. Where there
is a definite clinical suspicion of botulism, treatment with antitoxin
should not be delayed pending microbiological testing.
IDUs are susceptible to wound botulism when anaerobic conditions exist at
injection sites. Injecting drug users should be advised to smoke heroin
rather than inject and to avoid injecting into muscle or under the skin
(skin popping). The injection of substances that increase tissue damage may
facilitate the growth of anaerobic bacteria and therefore IDUs should try
to use as little citric acid as possible to dissolve heroin, and should
avoid the injection of mixtures of heroin and cocaine. They should also be
advised to seek urgent medical attention if they develop swelling, redness,
or pain at injecting sites.
Investigators (see email addresses below) at the PHLS in England and Wales
would be interested to hear of any recent cases of botulism in IDUs in
other European countries.

[Borrowing from a prior ProMED-mail posting moderator comment (Botulism,
wound, drug-related - UK: alert 20020223.3614), wound botulism has been
reported in injecting drug users (IDUs) in the United States and in
Europe. Association with drug injection was first reported in 1982 in New
York City (1). In 1995 there were 19 cases reported in California
associated with contaminated black tar heroin (2). In 1998 there was an
outbreak of 5 cases reported in Switzerland, all associated with illicit
injection drug use.
In October 2001 ProMED reported a case of wound botulism in Scotland, and
questioned whether the heightened surveillance for unusual illness in IDUs,
as an aftermath of the outbreak of _C. novyi_ associated with contaminated
heroin might have led to isolated case reports. In this article there is
mention of 13 cases since the beginning of the year, suggesting the
possibility of a contaminated batch of heroin on the market in the UK,
somewhat reminiscent of the outbreak in California in 1995 (2). One wonders
if other countries have been seeing a similar increase in wound botulism in
recent months.
