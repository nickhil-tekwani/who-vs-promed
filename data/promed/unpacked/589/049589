The Food and Drug Administration is issuing a nationwide warning to
consumers against drinking unpasteurized orange juice under a variety of
brand names manufactured by Sun Orchard, Inc. of Tempe, Arizona because
they have the potential to be contaminated with _Salmonella_, an organism
which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children,
frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy
individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe
headache, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Long term
complications can include severe arthritis.
Although the company has already issued a warning and undertaken a recall
of some of the affected product, FDA is taking action because more lots of
contaminated product are being reported by the firm.
The recalled unpasteurized orange juice was distributed to restaurants and
other food service establishments in California, Washington, Oregon, Utah,
New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, Arizona, and British Colombia, Canada and to
one retail store, Zupan Grocery, in Portland, Oregon. The product is sold
in clear gallon, quart, pint and 1/2 pint plastic containers marked with
the following:
9306 "Enjoy by" 11/18/99 9307 "Enjoy by" 11/19/99 9309 "Enjoy by" 11/21/99
9309 "Enjoy by" 11/22/99 9309 "Enjoy by" 11/23/99. The following labels are
involved: Sun Orchard, Sysco, Aloha, and Zupan. Unlabeled 1/2 pint
containers were sold to Epicurean Provisions, Tempe, Arizona for the
Enchantment Resort. Consumers should inquire about the source of any
unpasteurized orange juice they may be served at a restaurant or other
dining facility.
To date no illnesses have been reported in connection with this problem.
The potential for contamination was noted after routine testing by the
company revealed the presence of _Salmonella_ in a holding tank that had
been used to process the orange juice. The FDA has not identified the
source of the contamination.
Production of the unpasteurized product has been suspended. FDA and the
company continue their investigation as to the source of the problem. To
date, no definitive conclusions have been reached about the possible source
of this problem.
Consumers who have purchased unpasteurized orange juice with the Zupan
label are urged to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund.
Consumers with questions may contact the company at 1-800-505-8423.

[This appears to be a second incident involving this company. A widespread
outbreak of salmonellosis linked to unpasteurized orange juice was covered
by ProMED-mail last June and July. References are cited above. - Mod.ES
