Mass culling? Not for the USA
--------------------------------------
A previous post on ProMED-mail (reference above) discussed why vaccination
is out of the question for controlling a future FMD outbreak in the USA; it
could be used for protecting breeding stock. This contribution discusses
why mass culling -- as opposed to selective culling -- although being used
in the UK, is also out of the question for the USA.
There are several arguments against mass culling, which taken together add
up to making it an impossible task for a country with the density of
livestock the USA has in many states. First, it kills many adult animals
which would otherwise have survived infection, albeit with perhaps a 10
percent loss in productivity (as compared with a 100 percent loss if they
were killed). That leaves a legacy of surviving but infectious animals,
which would take perhaps years to eliminate in order for the USA to return
to FMD-free status.
But since Japan & South Korea, which together account for over 60 percent
of US beef & pork exports, will ban imports of both from the US at the
first report of an outbreak (Australia and New Zealand will be only too
glad to fill the gap), a 10 percent loss in meat production would not
affect the capacity to export to other markets.
Second, the logistics of slaughtering and disposal of possibly millions of
head of livestock quickly overwhelms capacity. During the FMD outbreak in
Taiwan in 1997, 4 million pigs were culled, at a peak rate of 130 000 per
day, after the army got up to speed. Let´s say the US Army could do the
same on the larger US feed lots. That´s still 30 days to kill 4 million; 30
days in which the disease is still spreading. It is questionable, however,
whether the public would stand for the TV spectacle of the US Army or
National Guard shooting livestock. Even the UK has not yet gone that far.
Third, the risk of delays due to litigation are great. Farmers and national
associations of breeders would seek injunctions, animal rights and
environmental groups would do the same. Slaughtering could be held up for
weeks. Also, the huge amounts of money needed to finance a big emergency
would exceed existing provisions and require additional legislation,
preceded by much debate, before being approved. Even emergency funds from
the White House would take time to arrive. My experience with public health
authorities has shown that they will always live in hope that the outbreak
will be contained with minimum expenditure, leading inevitably to too
little funding too late to do any good. I have no reason to believe animal
health authorities will react differently.
Models exist that purport to show for US conditions under the most
optimistic circumstances, if culling of 95 percent of latently infected
plus infectious herds can be achieved beginning in the second week after
recognition of the first outbreak, "only" 20 percent of an affected
region´s herds need be destroyed to achieve control. But if culling to that
level is delayed by just one week, the eventual destruction will have to be
more than 90 percent. I don´t think anyone can seriously believe any state
agency is going to be able to move that fast, or be able to cull to that level.
Finally, a recent analysis of the potential cost of FMD in California
projects direct costs, plus production losses, plus trade losses would sum
to around US$8000 per head culled, or US$ 8 billion per million head -- and
this may be a conservative estimate. Twenty percent of the cattle in Texas
alone is 1.6 million head.
I rest my case.
