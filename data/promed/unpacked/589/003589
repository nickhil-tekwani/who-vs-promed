In the Khabarovsk territory in January 2016 the veterinary service Komsomolsk-on-Amur has identified 3 cases of infection with trichinellosis.

According to the press service of the administration of this city, trichinellosis was diagnosed in 2 residents of the taiga village of Tuluchi, Vanino district, and 1 man from the village of Molodezhniy, close to the city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur. Also a spouse of 1 of the infected persons is now under medical investigation with similar symptoms. ['taiga' refers to the largest land biome on earth, the high-latitude boreal forest between the tundra and the temperate forest - CopyEd.PG]

The inhabitants of taiga rural areas usually do not check the meat of wild animals for the presence of pathogens, for instance trichinellosis.

During 2015 only 55 requests for investigations for a veterinary-sanitary examination of potentially hazardous foods were recorded in the laboratories of the Komsomolsk-on-Amur. The Russian News Agency Vostok-Media more than once wrote that such [lack of attention] to health in various regions of the far Eastern Federal district caused outbreaks of trichinellosis. In 2012, after dried bear meat had been eaten in the village of Manila on the Kamchatka peninsula, trichinellosis was confirmed in 14 patients.

[Trichinellosis is endemic in wildlife in the Russian Federation and is sometimes seen even in domestic pigs. It is especially dangerous if the meat is used in sausage, where it is often not thoroughly cooked. This is very much a public-health issue, and the fact noted here -- that wild animals for human consumption are not submitted to veterinary authorities for recommended tests for trichinellosis -- is the key issue. - Mod.EP
