The epidemiological forecast for hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome (HFRS) in Udmurtia is not favorable for 2008, as more cases
among rodents are expected and because of this, more cases among
humans as well. This happens every 3-4 years, according to the press
service of Rospotrebnadzor (Territorial Directorate of the Federal
Services for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare).

During the past year, 383 cases of HFRS have been registered in
Udmurtia. The morbidity in rural population is 2.9 times higher than
in urban population. 30.5 percent of cases came from the city of
Ijevsk. In 2 territories of Udmurtia -- Kezsky and Krasnogorsky -- no
cases were registered. The most affected territories were Syumsinsky,
Kiznersky, Yak-Bodyinsky, Grakhovsky, Uvinsky, Alnashsky,
Karakulinsky, Vavozhsky, M-Purginsky, and Igrinsky.

Infection occurred occasionally in forested areas in 37.9 percent
cases; in households, 32.1 percent; in industry, 12.5 percent; and in
urban garden settings, 9.7 percent. To escape the risk of infection
officials recommend taking measures to prevent incursion of rodents.
This includes paying attention to sanitation, eradication of garbage
dumps, clearing undergrowth from nearby forest, active rodent control
measures, etc. Gardens require special attention, as every 5th
infection occurs there. The most dangerous time for infection is the
1st visit to the cottages after the winter months. The cleaning of
cottages by "wet methods" only is recommended. The most frequent mode
of infection is air-dust in up to 85 percent of cases. It is
necessary also to ventilate the rooms thoroughly. The food should be
protected from rodents and rodent-"exposed" food should not be used.
Hand washing is mandatory before meals and smoking. Bed linens should
be exposed to sunlight for 2-3 hours. All these simple measures will
prevent infection.

[The HFRS situation is expected to be tough in the summer of 2008.
Forest rodents have bred in significant numbers due to the warm
winter and they may migrate to human habitations. Rodent control
measures and dissemination of disease prevention information would be
beneficial. - Corr.VM
