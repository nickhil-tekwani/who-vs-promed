Peak Passed In Deadly Fever Outbreak
-----------------------------------------
An outbreak of a rare and deadly infectious virus that killed six people in
southern Russia and raised a national media-fuelled alarm appears to be
subsiding, local emergency officials said on Tuesday.
Gennady Vyakhirev, head of the civil defense unit at the Rostov office of
the Emergencies Ministry, said 90 patients were still being treated but were
thought to be out of danger.
"We can say the peak seems to have already been reached. It is under
control," he told Reuters by telephone.
The disease first struck the village of Oblivskaya in the Rostov region,
about 1000 km (620 miles) from Moscow, earlier this month. Vyakhirev said
health officials had diagnosed it as Congo-Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever [CCHF.

Dr Stephen Wright, a consultant at London's Hospital for Tropical Diseases,
said by telephone that the virus was transmitted mainly by bites from ticks,
although it was possible to catch it from close contact with infected
people.
It has appeared previously in Russia, the Middle East and Africa, causing
death in between 2 and 50 percent of those infected. In its worst form it
causes the patient to bleed to death through the nose, eyes, uterus or other
mucous membranes. The lurid symptoms caused a fever of speculation about
the "mystery disease" in the Russian press.
The disease has an incubation period of about 3 to 12 days, which means
doctors can determine fairly reliably when an outbreak has subsided if no
new cases appear among family members of those infected, Wright said.

Not a single new patient was hospitalized today in the Rostov region, but
there are 2 teenagers in the city of Ryazan with symptoms that fit the
profile of the disease. Both are from Rostov.
[This was carried under a broadcast headline of "Pandemic in the Rostov
Region". No news from the Stavropol Region.
I've just found Ryazan on the map and it is a region unto itself, with
Ryazan the city in Ryazan the region (an oblast?). It is north and west of
the Rostov and Stavropol regions, about halfway between Rostov and Moscow.

[If this is CCHF -- which the Rostov outbreak appears to have been -- there
is no danger of the teenagers from Rostov spreading it in Ryazan, since any
ticks they are carrying wonÂ´t spread it to other humans - Mod.JW
