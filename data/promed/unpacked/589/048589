Denmark is investigating an increase in the number of registered cases of a type of _E. coli_ reported in the past month. Enteroinvasive _E. coli_ (EIEC) is usually associated with travel diarrhea but the patients in the current outbreak have not been abroad, which suggests a common food may have made people sick, according to the Statens Serum Institut (SSI).

Between 23 Nov 2021 and 16 Dec 2021, 63 infected people with EIEC or ipaH-positive were registered at the Statens Serum Institut and 18 of them have been hospitalized. EIEC was isolated from 22 patients and the remaining 41 are PCR positive for the invasion plasmid antigen H (ipaH) gene, which is specific to _Shigella_ species and EIEC.

Patients live all over the country, and there are 43 women and 20 men sick. They are aged from 1 to 91 years old with a median age of 53.

Hovedstaden has the most cases with 23, Sj√¶lland has 19, Midtjylland has 14, and 7 live in Syddanmark. The Statens Serum Institut, Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (Fodevarestyrelsen) and DTU Food Institute are trying to find the source of infection.

EIEC can cause intestinal infections and is typically seen among travelers. It is closely related to _Shigella_. EIEC is transmitted from person to person or through drinking and bathing water as well as foods contaminated with human or animal feces. Microscopic amounts of feces can cause illnesses. The time between being infected and symptoms occurring is typically 1 to 3 days. Infection can cause diarrhea, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, or a fever lasting several days and usually goes away on its own. Plenty of fluids are important to prevent and treat dehydration related to diarrhea and vomiting. In case of severe diarrheal disease, consult a doctor.

EIEC primarily infects children in the developing world. There is no formal surveillance system for diarrheagenic _E. coli_ and most laboratories are unable to identify them, according to the CDC.

[A number of _E. coli_ strains have acquired virulence factors to become pathogens that could be called enteropaths, diarrheagenic _E. coli_. These strains differ relating their virulence factors, and clinical manifestations are referred to as:
Enterotoxigenic _E. coli_ (ETEC)
Enteropathogenic _E. coli_ (EPEC)
Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC)
Enteroaggregative _E. coli_ (EAEC)
Enteroinvasive _E. coli_ (EIEC)
Diffusely adherent _E. coli_ (DAEC).

In the past, most clinical laboratories had not been able to specifically identify any of these except for EHEC. Newer technologies using multiplex PCR (polymerase chain reaction) have become available and are moving from reference to more standard clinical laboratories to test for a cluster of organisms, including:
Enteric adenovirus
Astrovirus
Norovirus
Rotavirus A
Sapovirus
Cryptosporidium
_Cyclospora cayetanensis_
_Entamoeba histolytica_
_Giardia lamblia_
_Campylobacter (jejuni, coli and upsaliensis_)
_Clostridium difficile_ (toxin A/B)
_Plesiomonas shigelloides_
Salmonella
Shigella
_Yersinia enterocolitica_
_Vibrio (parahaemolyticus_, _vulnificus_, and _cholerae_)
Enteroaggregative _E. coli_ (EAEC)
Enteropathogenic _E. coli_ (EPEC)
Enterotoxigenic _E. coli_ (ETEC)
Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC)
Enteroinvasive _E. coli_ (EIEC).

EIEC is a human enteric pathogen that causes dysentery and is transmitted through contaminated food or water and person-to-person contact (1). Infections occur most commonly in developing countries (1,2). The 1971 outbreak in the United States was associated with imported cheese (3). More recently, contaminated vegetables were implicated in outbreaks in Italy in 2012 and the United Kingdom in 2014 (4,5). A 2018 outbreak investigation did not reveal the specific vehicle through which EIEC was transmitted.
