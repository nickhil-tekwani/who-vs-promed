I have noticed that trichinellosis is henceforth banished from the list but
being quoted in the latest ProMED-mail report about trichinellosis in
France, I would add the following and final comments:
1. I discuss in a previous ProMED-mail posting (Trichinosis, testing of
horse meat - European Union) how horses could be infected. Contaminated
pork fed to the horse is a possibility but accidental ingestion of wild
rodents or small carnivores grounded up in hay could explain horse
infections by wild isolates of _Trichinella_. Such a possibility could
occur in Mustangs...
2. Carcasses imported from North America are not frozen but refrigerated.
Carcasses from North America were responsible for two important outbreaks
involving 431 & 538 cases in 1985 and 1993 (Ancelle T et al., Am J
Epidemiol 1988 ;127:1302-11 & Am J Trop Med Hyg 1998 ;59:615-9).
Therefore, banning importations from Eastern Europe would not totally
suppress the risk of a new outbreak.
3. Horse meat related trichinellosis is definitely an emerging disease in
France and Italy. No outbreaks were described before 1975, 5 outbreaks were
described between 1975 and 1985 and 8 outbreaks were described since 1985
(3 of them reported in 1998 and involving more than 600 cases).
4. The veterinary control of trichinellosis, compulsory since 1985, is
inaccurate and inefficient. This is particularly worrying since a
veterinary control could be suggested for BSE prevention. If finding one
millimetre larvae in meat samples appears so difficult, what about finding
prions? An efficient prevention of horse meat trichinellosis could
therefore be a good model for preventing BSE.

I am a food animal veterinarian in North America and went to school in NA
so my experience with the food safety of horse meat is virtually nil. I had
no idea that _Trichinella_ spp. were of concern in equine but that may be
my faulty memory cells after 25 years out of school. I am also a
pathologist and a Diplomate of the American College of Vet Pathology but
that is 12 years past and that also makes me rusty. I was very appreciative
to read the article on the outbreak in France and without it being on
ProMED-mail I would not have been so well informed. Alberta also has one of
the few horse processing plants in NA and the falling market prospects for
the product were also very enlightening.
_Trichinella_ spp. occur only in very isolated pockets in swine in NA and
if it occurred it would be a "big news" emerging disease within the whole
very sensitive area of food safety. This is particularly true now that pork
is developing diversified products with more emphasis on not over-cooking
pork (done traditionally for fear of _Trichinella_ spp. infestation).
Your comment that trichinellosis now be banished forever struck a cord of
fear that access to such information would be restricted on ProMED-mail,
which I have come to rely on for up-to-date health and food safety
information. Indicators of failures of inspection systems is extremely
important information to prevent negative public health occurrences and
even more important with our global agriculture trade environment that is
ever expanding. The numerous occurrences seen on your list from food
imports underscores that information need.
I would encourage you to reconsider your position on trichinellosis.

Re your comment about American horsemeat coming from 'spent' horses going
direct to slaughter.
Not so.
The American (and Canadian) horsemeat business is concentrated amongst a
very few operators. I believe 65% of Canadian horsemeat exports come from 1
operator who has 3 plants, I think. These big operators 'feed' horses, just
like cattle. And a lot of the meat comes from younger animals. There are a
couple of feedlots here in Alberta, and others in Kansas and Texas that I
know of though others exist too.
Don't know if this affects your thoughts on _Trichinella_, but I thought
I'd let you know in the event it's relevant.
Enjoy this list-server very much. Thank you for your work and comments as a
moderator!

From: Schantz, Peter M. <pms1@cdc.gov>

I would be inclined to argue that trichinellosis associated with horsemeat
consumption is indeed an emerging zoonosis. Horses are a relatively newly
recognized source and since 1974 there have been at least twelve outbreaks
totaling more than 2800 cases. Horsemeat has been ingested by the French
and Italians, among others, for generations but the new outbreaks are
presumably related to factors associated with the international economy,
such that infected carcasses are now reaching a vulnerable population
supported by diagnostic services capable of properly diagnosing the disease.
Another factor associated with re-emergence of trichinellosis is the
resurgence of the disease in many of the former SS Republics and some
Eastern European countries where the apparent breakdown in government and
social services, including reliable meat inspection, have conspired to
result in the acquisition of many thousand of cases of trichinellosis from
pork.

[Thanks for the information on Horse Feedlots. I was unaware of their
existence. Being in three very different states will increase the
possibility that equine trichinosis might exist in North America. It
wouldn't take a bunch of students long to do the necessary slaughter house
surveys and produce some numbers, instead of opinion.
And thanks to all of you who responded which resulted in Jack's Pauline
conversion. - Mod.MHJ
