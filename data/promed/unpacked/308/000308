[Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is one of the diseases for which the OIE grants official recognition status; see commentary in ProMED-mail post 20130906.1926591.

In November of 2013, Senegal also reported an outbreak of CBPP in the Kolda region; see ProMED-mail post 20131119.2061886. The event was resolved in May 2014. In response to this outbreak, 137 180 susceptible cattle were vaccinated in Medina Yoro Foulah Department. See final report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000015266_20140521_141022.pdf.

Humans are not known to be susceptible to CBPP, so there is no public health risk (http://tinyurl.com/km6t6w7). - Mod.CRD
