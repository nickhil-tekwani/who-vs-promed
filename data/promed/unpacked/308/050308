A 2nd Massachusetts resident has been diagnosed with cholera, and 4
others are suspected of having the intestinal ailment, state disease
trackers reported today [28 Jan 2011].

Like the man treated this week at Massachusetts General Hospital for
the disease, the other patients attended a lavish wedding at a resort
in the Dominican Republic and fell ill upon returning home. All the
patients are recovering, and there is no evidence the disease is
spreading in Massachusetts, said Dr. Larry Madoff, director of the
Division of Epidemiology and Immunization at the Massachusetts
Department of Public Health [and Editor, ProMED-mail - Mod.LL].

A young woman complaining of diarrhea, one of the hallmarks of
cholera, was treated in the emergency room at Brigham and Women's
Hospital earlier this week and given oral rehydration, said Erin
McDonough, spokeswoman for the Boston hospital. Preliminary testing
found that the woman, who was not identified because of patient
confidentiality laws, had cholera.

"The physician I spoke with said there is very little concern with
cholera cases in the US because of the availability of medications and
clean water," McDonough said. "It's unlikely there would be any
transmission."

A father and his 3 children are suspected of having the bacterial
condition, said Madoff, adding that disease specialists are awaiting
laboratory tests on at least one member of the family before a firm
diagnosis can be made. "We're certainly very suspicious that one or
more of the family members may turn out to be positive as well,"
Madoff said. That family, he said, was "in the same setting where we
know everybody else acquired it."

That setting was a high-end resort in the Dominican Republic, where
more than 400 guests celebrated a wedding last weekend. Dozens,
including attendees from Venezuela, the USA, and elsewhere, became
sick after returning home. The timing of their symptoms suggests they
were infected while in the Dominican Republic.

The source of the outbreak is unknown. It has been reported that
guests dined on lobster, and shellfish can harbor the germs. But if
food is cooked thoroughly, the risk of infection should be mitigated.
Cholera most often spreads through tainted water or sewage but can be
conveyed by contaminated food. The resort issued a statement saying
that while it "deeply regrets the food poisoning/cholera cases that
recently occurred during an exclusive wedding party in a private villa
residence within our resort," the food, drinks, and ice were provided
by an outside catering company hired by the party's hosts.

[All 6 cases acquired the infection in the Dominican Republic. It
would be unlikely that spread of cholera would occur in areas like the
USA with adequate sanitary facilities and the availability of clean
water. - Mod.LL]
