See also: 14 Oct 2005, 26 Aug 2005, 12 Aug 2005, 5 Aug 2005, 29 Jul 2005
Information received on 18 and 19 Oct 2005 from Dr Evgueny A.
Nepoklonov, Head of the Main Veterinary Department, Ministry of
Agriculture and Food, Moscow:
End of previous report period: 5 Oct 2005 (see Disease Information,
18 [41], 336, dated 14 Oct 2005).
End of this report period: 19 Oct 2005.
Precise identification of agent: influenza A virus subtype H5N1.
Date of first confirmation of the event: 23 Jul 2005.
Date of start of the event: 18 Jul 2005.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
Details of new outbreak
First administrative division (region): Tula
Lower administrative division (district):Efremov
Type of epidemiological unit: village
Name of the location: Jandovka village
Date of start of the outbreak: 14 Oct 2005
Species: avi
Number of animals in the outbreak
susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
approx. 3000 / -- / -- / approx. 3000 / --
Diagnosis:
Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed: Federal Centre for
Animal Health (ARRIAH), Vladimir (national reference laboratory for
avian influenza)
Diagnostic tests used: PCR(1)
Date: 19 Oct. 2005
Results: positive for virus subtype H5N1
Diagnostic tests used: sequencing of HA cleavage site
Date: ongoing
Results: pending
The reasons for suspicion were the clinical signs, the presence of a
lake on the territory of the affected village, and the presence of
migratory birds (unidentified ducks, probably mallard) during the
week before the outbreak.
Control measures applied:
- stamping out applied to all birds within the affected village;
- quarantine (all transport of poultry, poultry products, feed, etc.
is prohibited; restriction measures are being applied to the affected village);
- disinfection of backyards and roads in the village.
Other details/comments: the mortality rate within the infected
backyard farms was estimated as follows:
- ducks: greater than 4 percent;
- muscovy ducks: greater than 44 percent;
- chickens: greater than 51 percent;
- geese: greater than 75 percent;
- turkeys: 100 percent.
It should be noted that these are minimum values, as they do not take
into account the sick birds that had already been destroyed.
(1) PCR: polymerase chain reaction

[The Tula oblast is in the far western part of the country, just
south of Moscow in the Central Federal District. This outbreak was
first recognized last July (2005), so it has been around a while.
Another interesting feature of this outbreak is the variation in
mortality rates from only 4 percent in ducks, which doesn't sound
like a new influenza virus to as high as 100 percent in turkeys. - Mod.PC]
