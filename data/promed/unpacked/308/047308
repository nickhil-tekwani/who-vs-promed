The Illinois Department of Public Health is investigating an outbreak of
_E. coli_ 0157:H7 that has been linked to a private party for 1800 held
Sept. 4 at a farm near Petersburg that has left 281 persons ill.
Dr. John R. Lumpkin, state public health director, is urging those who
attended the event to seek medical attention for sicknesses involving
abdominal cramps with diarrhea. "This particular strain of _E. coli_
produces a powerful toxin that can cause severe illness and even death,"
Dr. Lumpkin said. "People who are ill should immediately contact their
physician."
Laboratory tests have confirmed that 27 of those who are ill were positive
for _E. coli_ 0157:H7. Interviews with those hospitalized, others who are
ill and their doctors linked the illnesses to the party, which was held in
a cow pasture.
Staff from the Department, Menard County Health Department and local health
departments have telephoned more than 500 persons who attended the event.
Those called are told of the outbreak and asked if they have been ill with
symptoms associated with _E. coli_. They also have been questioned about
the food they ate, what they drank and other possible exposures .
Information about the outbreak has been sent to local health departments
throughout Illinois, to Springfield area physicians and to states with
residents who attended.
Preliminary information indicates that persons from 16 Illinois counties
and seven other states attended the event. The counties are Cook, Franklin,
Fulton, Greene, Logan, McLean, Macon, Macoupin, Mason, Menard, Morgan,
Peoria, St. Clair, Sangamon, Tazewell and Winnebago. The seven states are
California, Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio.

weekend party near Petersburg have reported symptoms of _E. coli_ and, of
those, 22 have required hospitalization. Forty-four persons are culture
positive for _E. coli_. State and local health department staffs have
contacted 592 of the estimated 1800 persons who were at the party.
