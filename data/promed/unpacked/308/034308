Investigation of a _Salmonella_ Infection Linked to Rattlesnake Pills
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The CDC and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment have linked one person's _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Oranienburg infection to taking rattlesnake pills. Rattlesnake pills are often marketed as remedies for various conditions, such as cancer and HIV infection. These pills contain dehydrated rattlesnake meat ground into a powder and put into pill form. CDC recommends that you talk to your health care provider if you are considering taking rattlesnake pills, especially if you are in a group more likely to get a severe _Salmonella_ infection.

Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicate that one person in Kansas became sick after taking rattlesnake pills purchased in Mexico. The ill person reported taking rattlesnake pills in the week before getting sick. Advanced laboratory testing called whole genome sequencing showed that the involved _Salmonella_ matched the _Salmonella_ found in rattlesnake pills from Mexico collected in an earlier, unrelated investigation.

Reptiles and their meat can carry _Salmonella_ and make people sick. Past outbreak investigations have identified rattlesnake pills as a source of human salmonellosis.

People in the following groups are more likely to get severe salmonellosis: people with weakened immune systems, including people who are receiving chemotherapy or have HIV; pregnant women; children younger than 5 years; and older adults. If you get sick after taking rattlesnake pills, contact your health care provider.

[Snakes and other reptiles and amphibians are well known sources of salmonellae. This case report predates _Arizona hinshawii_ being renamed _Salmonella arizonae_:

CDC: _Arizona hinshawii_ Septicemia Associated with Rattlesnake Powder -- California MMWR. 1983;32:464-5

In November 1982, a 61-year-old Hispanic woman who had been undergoing palliative chemotherapy for an unresectable primary adenocarcinoma of the gall bladder was hospitalized in Oakland, California, with abdominal discomfort, rigors, fever to 39.4 deg. C (approx. 103 deg. F), and a neutropenia of 264 white blood cells per cubic mm. Admission blood cultures grew _A. hinshawii_.

Initial questioning revealed no apparent source for infection. After reading a report of overwhelming infection with _Arizona hinshawii_ in a cancer patient who had taken snake powder capsules (1), her physician asked about this and other non-prescribed remedies. A daughter had administered snake capsules to her mother daily, along with medicine prescribed by her physician. One such capsule obtained from the daughter grew _Escherichia coli_, _Enterobacter cloacae_, _Enterococcus_, _Salmonella_ Phoenix, _Staphylococcus epidermidis_, and _A. hinshawii_. After treatment with ampicillin, the patient's white blood cell count returned to normal, and blood cultures became negative, but fever persisted. Chloramphenicol was started, and she gradually improved and returned home.

Joint investigation by state and federal food and drug agencies at the Oakland retail herb and medicine shop where the capsules were purchased led to a state embargo and seizure of the rattlesnake powder (Pulvo de Vibora). Recovered capsules grew _Salmonella_ species _S._ Newport, _S._ Poona, _S._ Anatum, and several _A. hinshawii_ serotypes. A total of 2 Los Angeles importers selling these folk remedies were identified; both agreed to discontinue importation and sale of Pulvo de Vibora. The source of the rattlesnake capsules in Mexico was not determined.

Editorial Note
--------------
Editorial Note: _Arizona hinshawii_ is a gram-negative bacillus in the _Enterobacteriaceae_ family and resembles the genus _Salmonella_ antigenically, clinically, and epidemiologically. It was 1st recovered in 1939 from diseased reptiles in Arizona and was initially called "_S._ Dar-es-Saalam variety from Arizona." It was later distinguished from _Salmonella_, but as of 1 Jul 1983, CDC reclassified _A. hinshawii_ with the genus _Salmonella_, as _Salmonella_ (_Arizona_) and the appropriate serotypic reference. Reptiles constitute the main natural reservoir, but man, poultry, and other animals have also developed disease from _A. hinshawii_. Human infection with this pathogen should suggest inquiries of a possible connection with reptiles (also poultry and eggs). In the case reported here, it led to public health action involving state embargo of rattlesnake powder that had been used as a cancer remedy.

Because cancer patients are often severely immunocompromised, neutropenic, and cachectic, they are at high risk of infection. Their infections tend to be serious and often fatal. Yet, such patients are known to consume high-risk foods and drugs, such as raw liver, raw beef, raw milk, and, as in this case, raw rattlesnake powder.

Rattlesnake powder (ground rattlesnake) may be widely available in California and elsewhere in the nation. The California State Food and Drug Branch continues to monitor herb stores in Hispanic areas, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has increased its surveillance of imports from Mexico.

The following article is a good review of the relationship and public health importance of squamates and salmonellae:

Whiley H, Gardner MG and Ross K: A Review of Salmonella and Squamates (Lizards, Snakes and Amphisbians): Implications for Public Health. Pathogens. 2017;6(3). pii: E38. doi: 10.3390/pathogens6030038

Abstract
--------
Globally, there has been an increase in squamates (particularly lizards and snakes) being kept as pets. Additionally, urban spread has resulted in greater human encroachment and interaction with the natural habitat of wild squamates. A potential consequence of increasing human interaction with squamates is the increased potential for disease transfer. This review collates the literature describing clinical salmonellosis cases that were definitively linked to a squamate through testing of the animal and population-based studies which investigate the risk of salmonellosis linked to pet squamates. It was demonstrated that although squamate-acquired salmonellosis accounted for a small percentage of total cases, children under 5 were at greatest risk, with the clinical manifestations tending to be more severe. In many cases, it was noted that the patient was unaware of the risks associated with keeping squamates and did not practice proper hand hygiene after handling the animals or cleaning cages. This highlights the need for more education focused on informing the general public of ways to reduce the risk of salmonellosis from pet squamates. There is also the need for future research into the role of wild squamates in the spread of human salmonellosis, both directly and indirectly through cross contamination
