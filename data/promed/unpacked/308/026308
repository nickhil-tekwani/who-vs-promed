3. "If #Ebola cases continue to accrue at this rate for the rest of the month there will be approximately 80 cases in [October 2019]. In a normal outbreak, that's a lot -- more than the entire Equateur outbreak in the spring-early summer of 2018. But it is 35% fewer cases than October 2018. So, good!"
2. "October [2019] is on track to record the fewest #Ebola cases since [September 2018], when the North Kivu-Ituri outbreak really kicked into gear. There's been an average of 2.6 cases/day in October, half of the daily increase in [September 2019. At the height of the outbreak, there were 14.8/day in May [2019]."

UNICEF DR Congo Ebola situation report 45: North Kivu, Ituri, and South Kivu - reporting period: 30 Sep-13 Oct 2019
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Highlights
----------
- In Mambasa, UNICEF engaged in a successful negotiation that led to the reduction of community resistance and gaining access to 2 informal mining areas where a number of Ebola virus disease (EVD) contacts were suspected to circulate. Communication teams worked with local community to promote acceptance of the overall EVD response and recommendations were made on potential pillar 3 interventions.
- In Butembo health zone, UNICEF and its implementing partner, Enseignement Primaire, Secondaire et Technique (EPST), trained 28 inspectors on the Guidance Notes and Ebola prevention. In turn, inspectors trained more than 3000 teachers, school directors and members of parents' committees, in 352 schools in eight EVD-affected health zones. These teachers subsequently sensitized more than 60 000 students.
- In Lwemba hotspot, a new office was opened in Biakato following the security incident with the community. UNICEF worked with local communities' leaders in Lwemba to reestablish humanitarian access and identify community priority needs and lay the ground for reconciliation and social cohesion. An initial six wells were refurbished, and plans were agreed with the community for the construction of latrines for five priority schools.
- A total of 750 478 children were vaccinated against polio (91 per cent coverage) in 17 health zones affected by EVD in North Kivu as a result of the oral polio vaccination (OPV) campaign conducted by UNICEF in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MoH). The OPV campaign was combined with vitamin A supplementation for children aged 6-59 months and deworming for children from 12-59 months.

Key epidemic numbers
--------------------
- 3106 confirmed cases (WHO, 13 Oct 2019);
- 876 children younger than 18 years among confirmed cases (WHO, 13 Oct 2019);
- 2036 deaths among confirmed cases (WHO, 13 Oct 2019)

Key figures
-----------
- 35 implementing partners, including 14 national actors;
- 2775 community workers and mobilizers;
- 113 community radio partners;
- 1082 psychosocial agents, including caregivers, in UNICEF-run nurseries;
- 90 IPC/WASH [infection prevention and control/water, sanitation, and hygiene] supervisors and 433 hygienists for decontaminations.

Epidemiological overview
------------------------
With an additional 29 new confirmed cases reported in the last 2 weeks, a total of 3220 EVD confirmed cases were reported as of 13 Oct 2019, among which 3106 confirmed and 114 probable cases. More than 2/3 (2150) of EVD cases died (global case fatality rate remains 67 per cent). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56 per cent (1806) were female and 28 per cent (915) were children aged less than 18 years.

- Fri 25 Oct 2019. Butembo cases
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/10/more-ebola-cases-drc-including-butembo
[byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

More Ebola cases in DRC, including Butembo
------------------------------------------
Today [25 Oct 2019] the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) Ebola technical committee (CMRE) confirmed that the virus had returned to Butembo, just 10 days after the former hot spot was cleared of the disease. In a report detailing 6 new cases confirmed yesterday [24 Oct 2019], the CMRE said 4 of the cases were from Mandima, and both Butembo and Kalunguta reported a single case. 3 deaths were also recorded yesterday, including a community death in Mandima. As of yesterday, the CMRE said officials had vaccinated 241 946 people with Merck's Ebola vaccine.

Earlier this month [October 2019], DRC officials tweeted that the last remaining patients at an Ebola treatment center in Butembo had been discharged, a sign the virus was on the retreat from that area of North Kivu province [see next item].

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) online Ebola dashboard, 4 more cases were confirmed today, bringing the outbreak total to 3260, including 2177 deaths. A total of 486 suspected cases are still under investigation, and 117 cases remain categorized as probable.

US leads Ebola donors, but future uncertain
-------------------------------------------
Today [25 Oct 2019], the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) published the 1st analysis of donor funding during this Ebola outbreak -- the world's 2nd largest -- and said the United States leads donors.

From August 2018 to September 2019, KFF estimates USD 546 million was provided by donors to address Ebola in the DRC, with USD 148 million coming from the United States. Other top donors included the World Bank (USD 130 million), the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies (USD 73 million), the United Kingdom (USD 64 million), and the European Commission (USD 52 million).

But not all of the USD 546 million provided direct support to the DRC's response efforts. "Only half of funding (50%), including about 1/3 of US funding, was provided in direct support of the official DRC response plans, which guide national response strategy and enumerate resource needs," the KFF analysis said. "This could have implications for the coordination of donor efforts and whether funding is being directed to the most critical or pressing activities."

KFF said the status of US donor funding going forward is uncertain, including whether the current administration or Congress will provide additional funds. Also uncertain is how much, if any, leftover funds from the 2015 emergency Ebola response funding still exist within the US Agency for International Development or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

- Tue 15 Oct 2019. Butembo apparently free of new Ebola cases
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/10/butembo-treatment-center-cleared-ebola-patients-drc
[byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Butembo treatment center cleared of Ebola patients in DRC [BUT see item above -- Ebola back in Butembo after 10 days apparently free of disease - Mod.LK]

For the 1st time since September 2018, the Butembo Ebola treatment center is clear of the deadly virus, as the last 2 patients still being treated were just released, according to the Twitter feed of Ibrahima Soce Fall, MD, the WHO assistant director-general for emergency response. Butembo had been a hot spot of Ebola virus activity throughout the 14-month-long outbreak in DRC.

Yesterday [14 Oct 2019], the DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) said the 2 cases confirmed yesterday were from Mandima, which has been a more recent hotspot of virus activity. Officials confirmed 4 new cases today [15 Oct 2019], according to the WHO's online Ebola dashboard. The new infections raise outbreak totals to 3224, including 2,150 deaths. Officials are still investigating 411 suspected cases.

Cases continue at low levels
----------------------------
From 7-14 Oct 2019, the DRC tracked 14 Ebola cases in 6 health zones: Mandima, Beni, Kalunguta, Nyankunde, Lolwa, and Oicha. According to the latest update from the WHO's regional office, 41% of cases in the past 3 weeks were from Mandima, 14% from Mambasa, and 12% from Oicha.

"The number of new confirmed cases does seem to be declining, but previous experience shows that this trend needs to be interpreted with caution," WHO's regional office said. "Notwithstanding this, in areas where robust public health measures have succeeded, no new confirmed cases have been reported, showing that these approaches need to continue."

The case fatality rate in the outbreak remains at 66%, with 162 health workers infected (5% of total cases).

As of yesterday [14 Oct 2019], the CMRE said 237 956 people have been vaccinated with Merck's Ebola vaccine. And as the CMRE noted recently, officials will introduce a 2nd vaccine -- the one made by Johnson & Johnson -- in November [2019], after 500 000 doses are expected to arrive in the DRC on 18 Oct 2019.

[3] Response
- Sun 27 Oct 2019. North Kivu: UNESCO
[Radio Okapi; in French, machine trans., edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2019/10/27/actualite/sante/lutte-contre-ebola-lunesco-va-mener-des-actions-prevention-dans-les

UNESCO joins the fight against Ebola in the province of North Kivu through preventive actions in schools and sensitization of the public through community radio.

The memorandum of collaboration signed on Fri 25 Oct 2019 between the United Nations Office for the Coordination of the Emergency Response to the Ebola Epidemic in the DRC and this UN agency provides USD 80 000 for these actions. The start-up is planned, according to the UNESCO representative in DR Congo, from 1 Nov 2019.

"The 1st action will be to carry out prevention at the school level. The 2nd action will consist of sensitizing communities through community radios in local languages. We will also equip 200 schools with complete hygiene kits; we will train 200 school directors and the prefects on the prevention and fight against the Ebola virus; then we will train 36 journalists from the 36 community radios on the prevention and the fight against the Ebola virus on the messages to pass to the communities through their antennas," explained Jean-Pierre Ilboudo [UNESCO representative in the DRC].

ref: Mulangu S. The PALM Consortium: A multicenter, multioutbreak randomized controlled trial of Ebola virus disease therapeutics. Open Forum Infectious Diseases 2019; 6 (Suppl_2):S12-S13
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
----------
Recent outbreaks of Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) reinforce the desperate need to establish definitively the comparative safety and efficacy of different medical countermeasures (MCM).

Methods
-------
Through a multipartner governance framework under WHO coordination, the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale, and NIAID collaborated with clinical partners (the MOH, ALIMA, MSF) to launch a randomized controlled trial in 2018 in the North Kivu/Ituri provinces of DRC. PCR+ participants receiving enhanced supportive care are being randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive either ZMapp(TM) (control arm), remdesivir, mAb114, or REG-EB3 according to standard treatment regimens. Stratification is by site, country, and baseline nucleoprotein (NP) PCR cycle threshold (CT) of 22 or less, or higher than 22. The primary objective is a comparison of 28-day mortality relative to the control arm. The planned accrual is for 125 patients per arm. Secondary objectives include an evaluation of the comparative safety and tolerability of the 4 investigational MCMs, relative changes in viral load over time, comparisons of treatment efficacy according to baseline risk categories, 58-day mortality, RNA clearance from semen, and an assessment of the validity of drug-class comparisons, including efficacy. The study is monitored by an independent data and safety monitoring committee (DSMB).

Results
-------
Enrollment commenced in the Ebola treatment unit in Beni in November, 2018, with sites in Butembo and Katwa added in early 2019. Time from study concept initiation to study start was only 3.5 months. Ongoing hurdles encountered to date include maintenance of cold chain requirements for the MCMs and marked volatility in the security situation surrounding sites affecting staff and patient safety. Despite these challenges, data quality and completed follow-up have been remarkably high and by mid-April, 2019, accrual to date (see table -- available at the source URL above) had already surpassed the predefined threshold triggering an interim DSMB review.

Conclusion
----------
Scientifically rigorous and ethically sound clinical research can take place during disease outbreaks even within a conflict zone. Results about the relative efficacy of the evaluated investigational MCMs are pending the completion of the trial.

["In November 2018, NIAID and the Democratic Republic of the Congo's National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB) began a phase 2/3 clinical trial testing multiple investigational Ebola therapies. The trial, known as PALM (short for "Pamoja Tulinde Maisha" a Swahili phrase which roughly translates to "together save lives") was conducted by a research consortium overseen by the World Health Organization that included nongovernment organizations and the DRC Ministry of Health. It was designed to compare mortality among patients receiving one of three investigational drugs (mAb114, REGN-EB3 and remdesivir) with a control group of patients receiving the investigational monoclonal antibody cocktail treatment ZMapp. Preliminary results announced in August 2019 indicated that patients receiving REGN-EB3 and mAb114 had a greater chance of survival compared to patients receiving ZMapp or remdesivir. The results prompted an independent data and safety monitoring board to recommend the study be stopped and that all future patients be randomized to receive REGN-EB3 or mAb114 in an extension phase of the study."

- Wed 23 Oct 2019. Social resistance fuels Ebola [edited]
https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/6/Supplement_2/S12/5604780

ref: Q Mian et al. Social resistance fuels Ebola transmission in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Open Forum Infectious Diseases 2019; 6 (Suppl_2):S12
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
----------
The 2nd largest Ebola epidemic in history is currently raging in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Stubbornly persistent Ebola transmission has been associated with social resistance, ranging from passive noncompliance to overt acts of aggression toward Ebola response teams.

Methods
-------
We explored community resistance using focus group discussions and assessed the prevalence of resistant views using standardized questionnaires.

Results
-------
Despite being generally cooperative and appreciative of the foreign-led Ebola response, focus group participants provided eyewitness accounts of aggressive resistance to control efforts, consistent with recent media reports. Mistrust of Ebola response teams was fueled by perceived inadequacies of the response effort ("herd medicine"), suspicion of mercenary motives, and violation of cultural burial mores ("makeshift plastic morgue"). Survey questionnaires found that the majority of respondents had compliant attitudes with respect to Ebola control. Nonetheless, 78/630 (12%) respondents believed that Ebola was fabricated and did not exist in the area, 482/630 (72%) were dissatisfied with or mistrustful of the Ebola response, 60/630 (9%) sympathized with perpetrators of overt hostility, and 102/630 (15%) expressed noncompliant intentions in the case of Ebola illness or death in a family member, including hiding from the health authorities, touching the body, or refusing an official burial team. Denial of the biomedical discourse and dissatisfaction/mistrust of the Ebola response were statistically significantly associated with indicators of social resistance.

Conclusion
----------
We concluded that social resistance to Ebola control efforts was prevalent among focus group and survey participants. Mistrust, with deep political and historical roots in this area besieged by chronic violence and neglected by the outside world, may fuel social resistance. Resistant attitudes may be refractory to short-lived community engagement efforts targeting the epidemic but not the broader humanitarian crisis in Eastern DRC.
