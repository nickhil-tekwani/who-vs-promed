["Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is a disease of ruminants (_Bos_ and _Bubalus_ genuses) caused by _Mycoplasma mycoides_ subsp. _mycoides_ (Mmm). It is manifested by anorexia, fever and respiratory signs such as dyspnoea, polypnoea, cough and nasal discharges in bovines. Definite diagnosis requires the isolation or detection of the aetiological agent. The main problems for control or eradication are the frequent occurrence of subacute or subclinical infections, the persistence of chronic carriers after the clinical phase and the lack of extensive vaccine coverage". (https://www.woah.org/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.04.08_CBPP.pdf)

The current and previous outbreaks in Namibia are located in zones without a recognized CBPP status. See map at https://www.woah.org/app/uploads/2021/05/eng-namibia.png. - Mod.CRD
