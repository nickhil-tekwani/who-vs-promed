[The 5 outbreaks are located in 3 provinces, 2 in northern and one in
central Algeria (see map at the URL above and the maps with
administrative boundaries at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/reports/en_imm_0000008439_20090915_180505.pdf> and
<http://www.maparchive.org/details.php?image_id=46&sessionid=cfb5efa7a5d4b841decb84fe53b>.
The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Algeria is available at
<http://healthmap.org/r/009O>).

It may be assumed that the virus (or rather infected _Culicoides_
vectors) is not restricted to these 5 reported locations. The
bluetongue season in the region may be taken to be from June-July to
November-December.

In 2006, a bluetongue outbreak, caused by BTV-1, affected Algeria and
its 2 Maghreb neighbours, Morocco and Tunisia -- see ProMED archives
below. Since a BTV-1 vaccine has become available (in Europe), its
application now, at least for the protection of high-value breeding
sheep flocks, may be considered.- Mod.AS]
