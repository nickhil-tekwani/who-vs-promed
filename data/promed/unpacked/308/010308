West Nile fever may become a widespread infection in the Republic of
Tatarstan. West Nile virus antibodies have been detected in 12
percent of blood donors among 500 persons tested, according to
Professor Vladimir Boyko, head of the department in the Institute of
Ecology and Land Use. These data were presented at a roundtable of
the Academy of Science of the Republic of Tatarstan.

As a consequence of the construction of the Kuybyshevskoe water
reservoir and a warming climate, the numbers of waterfowl -- a
reservoir of West Nile virus -- have increased significantly.
Infection is transmitted by a species of mosquito which feeds on the
blood of nestlings. During recent years, conditions in the summer
have been favorable for virus spread and an increase in mosquito
numbers.

[The 1st outbreaks of West Nile fever were recorded in Russia in 1999
in the Volgograd, Astrakhan and Krasnodar regions (see ProMED archive
below). Cases of West Nile fever have also been recorded in recent
years in the Rostov region. All of these regions are in the south of
Russia in the Southern
Federal District. Cases of West Nile fever, however, have also been
recorded in more northerly regions, namely in the the Privolzhsky
Federal District. - Mod.NP

This is unsurprising news. Tatarstan (capital Kazan) straddles the
Volga river, the flyway for WNV-infected waterfowl migrating to and
from Africa -- see ProMED/Healthmap
<http://healthmap.org/r/009n>.

Information from GideonOnline

is that there were at least 10 human cases in the Volga delta between
1963 & 1968, and that human seropositivity rates of up to 8 percent
were found in European Russia & Western Siberia (see ProMED post West
Nile virus - former Soviet Union: background 20060908.2548).

The Republic of Tatarstan can be located (at No. 46) on the map of the
Privolzhsky Federal District at:
