Outbreaks of diarrhea and gastroenteritis caused by _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_ have been recently reported in many countries and
regions where this pathogen was previously unknown (1,2). In
mid-January 2005 (Figure - for figure see original URL - Mod.LL), the
number of cases of acute diarrhea produced by _V. parahaemolyticus_
dramatically increased in Puerto Montt, a major city in Region X of
Chile. The epidemic subsequently peaked in February 2005 and then
declined with isolated cases in March and April 2005. A total of 3725
cases of acute diarrhea were detected during the summer months of
January-April 2005 throughout Region X. This epidemic rapidly spread
to other urban areas in Region X and to the rest of Chile because
Region X is the source of about 75 percent of the seafood consumed in
Chile. By the end of March 2005, the total number of cases in Chile
was 10 783, making this the largest documented occurrence of _V.
parahaemolyticus_ diarrhea in the world.
Analysis of a questionnaire prepared by the health authority of
Region X and completed by 341 patients during January 2005, indicated
that all patients had clinical signs compatible with acute diarrhea
caused by _V. parahaemolyticus_ (3,4). Stool samples of 60 patients
with acute diarrhea were analyzed by standard procedures (5,6).
Serotyping confirmed that all _V. parahaemolyticus_ isolates were
O3:K6 (5,6), did not produce urease, and showed the Kanagawa
phenomenon (virulence-associated hemolysis) (5-8). PCR [polymerase
chain reaction] analysis indicated that the genome of these isolates
contained tdh, tlh, and toxRS/new open reading frame 8 DNA sequences
and lacked trh sequences (1,8), which are consistent with molecular
characteristics of the pandemic clone O3:K6 (1,5-8). Pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis confirmed that _V. parahaemolyticus_ strains isolated
from patients throughout the epidemic corresponded to pandemic clone
O3:K6, as did the strains isolated in Chile from 2 smaller outbreaks
in 1998 and 2004 (1,8). Strains of this clone also constituted the
only pathogenic strain of _V. parahaemolyticus_ detected in mussels
and the only pathogenic strain that has persisted in shellfish
throughout this period (1,8). The most common vectors in this
outbreak were clams and mussels, not oysters, which reflect the
pattern of consumption of shellfish in Chile during the summer (1,8,9).
This epidemic in 2005 points to the potential of _V.
parahaemolyticus_ O3:K6 to affect many susceptible persons if
preventive measures are not taken and enforced quickly (6-9).
Temperature and salinity have been reported as factors that influence
concentrations of _V. parahaemolyticus_ in the oceans (2,5,7,8).
During summer 2005, seawater temperatures of about 19 deg C (66 deg
F) were recorded in several places along the coast of Region X where
shellfish are collected (8). These temperatures were almost 3 degrees
above the average seawater temperature for January and February
measured at the official weather station in Region X. Many of these
areas with high seawater temperatures also have a wide tidal range,
and shellfish in these locations are exposed to solar radiation in
intertidal dry beds at ebb and low tides and can reach temperatures
of 30 deg C (86 deg F). Elevated seawater temperatures and intertidal
exposure to solar radiation can increase the concentration of _V.
parahaemolyticus_ in shellfish (and in the ocean), thereby increasing
the risk for human infection after consumption.
Spread of _V. parahaemolyticus_ toward the more northern and southern
latitudes, as demonstrated by the course of this epidemic and the
recent Alaskan outbreak, might be the result of climatic changes; a
warming trend in seawater was noted in both events (2,8). Expansion
of the _V. parahaemolyticus_ O3:K6 pandemic clone may have also been
facilitated by expansion of international trade because bacteria
could have been transported to Chile by ballast water from the
Northern Hemisphere (1,4,6). As in previous outbreaks, shellfish
responsible for this epidemic were harvested near international
shipping lanes (1,3,4,6). The appearance of _V. parahaemolyticus_
O3:K6 in Chile has thus converted the expansion of this strain into a
real pandemic because this vibrio is now present in 5 continents. The
persistence of _V. parahaemolyticus_ in Region X might also have been
encouraged by an expansion of finfish and shellfish aquaculture in
that area. As in other parts of the world, expansion of these food
industries could provide physical and nutritional substrates for
vibrios to persist and propagate when growth is triggered by
increases in temperature of seawater (1,2,8).
Emergence of _V. parahaemolyticus_ in Region X has also coincided
with expansion of harmful algal blooms in the same area. These blooms
are triggered by increases in seawater temperature and degradation of
the coastal environment (9,10). A connection has been established
between algal blooms and the presence of _V. cholerae_ and cholera
epidemics in the Gulf of Bengal and off the coast of Peru at the
start of the Latin America epidemic (10). Further research is
necessary to ascertain whether persistence of _V. parahaemolyticus_
and epidemics are related to algal blooms in this region of Chile.

[ProMED-mail covered this outbreak in 2005 in real time. The posting
summarizes the outbreak, stressing increased seawater temperature as
a major variable. Epidemiologically, the outbreak is quite impressive
in its size (more than 10 000), continued spread despite early
recognition, and the involvement of clams and mussels rather than
oysters. - Mod.LL]
