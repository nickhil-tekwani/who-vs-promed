Ethiopia has immunized 14.2 million children for measles over the past 3 weeks, the country's Ministry of Health disclosed on Sat 25 Jul 2020. The achievement has been recorded despite COVID-19 pandemic pressures and unrest in some parts of the country.

"Health workers across the country are the unsung heroes of our time," Dr. Meseret Zelalem, Maternal, Child Health and Nutrition Director at the Ministry, tweeted regarding the success.

Ethiopia has reached 14 344 285 children through the vaccination drive, achieving 96 percent of the planned 15 million, Dr. Meseret stated.

Out of the total immunized children, 89 386 were accessed in several refugee camps across the nation.

Ethiopia recorded more than 700 cases of measles in January this year [2020]. However, the actual caseload in the community was undetermined, due to inaccessibility of some among the affected areas.

The outbreak was declared in the East Wollega Zonal Health Bureau, in the country's southern district of Nunu Kumba, with the 1st case dating back to early December 2019.

The outbreak claimed 5 lives in East Wollega, but thanks to intensified surveillance and case management, no further measles-related deaths were recorded after 27 Jan 2020.

A mass vaccination program for migrant children in Lesvos completed its 1st round over the weekend.

The National Public Health Organization (EODY) announced it provided the 1st repeat shots of MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella/German measles) to over 2000 children at Moria hotspot.

Future phases include vaccinations at Samos and Leros islands migrant reception centres in the 1st half of August 2020. On Mon 27 Jul 2020, EODY will begin vaccinations of children at reception centres on the mainland (Attica and northern Greece), prioritising 1st shots over the repeat ones, in order to be finished by the start of the new school year on 1 Sep 2020.

[Both countries should be congratulated on achieving such high vaccination numbers, especially in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted vaccination programs worldwide.

According to a WHO/UNICEF report: "The disruptions in immunization services are largely due to the low supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers, travel restrictions, and low availability of health workers as focus shifted to COVID-19 response.

Officials said, due to the pandemic, at least 30 measles vaccination campaigns faced a risk of cancellation, which could result in further outbreaks in 2020 and beyond."
