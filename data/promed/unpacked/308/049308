Influenza Update number 138
---------------------------
Summary
-------
-- Influenza activity in the temperate regions of the northern
hemisphere remains at baseline inter-seasonal levels.
-- Countries in the tropical zone mostly report low influenza
activity but with some transmission reported in countries of the
Americas, western Africa, and southern Asia.
-- The influenza season is ongoing in South Africa though it appears
to have recently peaked. Some detailed preliminary information is now
available for severe cases in South Africa (see below). In Australia
the season appears to have started with notable increases in
influenza-like illness (ILI) consultations and confirmed cases. The
most common virus detected nationally in Australia is influenza
A(H1N1)2009, though this is not consistent in every state.

The influenza season in the northern hemisphere temperate areas has
ended. Nearly all of the countries of North America, Europe, northern
Africa and north Asia reported low or no influenza activity.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Influenza activity in countries of tropical zone was low overall with
a few areas of active transmission, most notably in West Africa and
South Asia. In countries of the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre (CAREC)
countries, there was a small increase in the percent of severe acute
respiratory infection (SARI) admissions. No SARI deaths were reported
but approximately 3 percent of total hospitalizations were for SARI in
children between 6 to 48 months of age. In the Dominican Republic, the
percentage of samples testing positive for respiratory viruses
decreased slightly; influenza A(H1N1)2009 has been the primary virus
in circulation there since late March [2011]. No influenza virus
activity was reported in Central American countries. In Colombia,
there was low level co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)2009 and
A(H3N2). In Brazil, there are reports of the increased number of
influenza cases especially in the south, southeast, and midwest of the
country. Influenza viruses including A(H1N1)2009 were identified in
circulation. In sub-Saharan Africa, influenza type B virus continues
to be predominant strain in both western and eastern Africa. Active
transmission of predominantly influenza B appears to be ongoing in
Ghana mixed with smaller numbers of influenza A(H1N1)2009. Much
smaller numbers of cases of influenza B reported in Nigeria and
Cameroon. Transmission in Kenya and Uganda has dropped to low levels
and the previously noted influenza A(H3N2) transmission in Rwanda has
also diminished to very low levels.

The overall influenza activity in the tropical Asia remained low with
some notable localized areas of transmission. Low numbers of influenza
A(H1N1)2009 viruses were reported from India associated with
unconfirmed media reports of cases occurring in the southern part of
the country. In Singapore ILI made up only 2 percent of polyclinic
attendances for acute respiratory illness, which is considered low,
however 51 percent of ILI cases tested positive for influenza virus in
the last 4 weeks. 83 percent of influenza viruses from ILI cases were
influenza A(H3N2); influenza A(H1N1)2009 and influenza B accounted for
11 percent and 6 percent of positive cases respectively.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
South America
-------------
Only low influenza activity was reported in the temperate regions of
South America. In Chile, ILI activity was less than [in] the previous
week, no deaths from influenza were reported, and influenza virus
detects were in low proportion compared to other respiratory viruses.
In Argentina, about 2 percent of respiratory specimens tested were
positive for influenza, mostly influenza A(H1N1)2009, but rates of ILI
are low. In Uruguay percent of SARI deaths among all deaths remained
stable and less than 5 percent. However, the percent of SARI
admissions to intensive care among all ICU admissions has been
trending upwards over the last month.

Southern Africa

Influenza transmission in South Africa appears to have peaked and is
in early decline, though still quite active. Transmission in the
country has been primarily associated with influenza A(H1N1)2009,
which has accounted for more than 83 percent of influenza viruses in
ILI cases. Influenza A(H3N2) and type B have accounted for 7.5 percent
and 3.8 percent of viruses respectively in that group. Notably,
influenza type B has made up a larger proportion of cases with severe
infections admitted to hospital (17 percent of all influenza viruses
from SARI cases). Based on a preliminary analysis of case data by the
National Institute for Communicable Diseases, the case-fatality ratio
among influenza positive patients admitted to hospital in 2011 is less
than in the 2010 season when influenza B was the most common
circulating strain (3 percent vs. 9 percent respectively (p=0.06)).
The age distribution of severe cases has been similar this season as
compared to 2010; 37 percent of cases have been between the ages of 2
and 4 years (37 percent in 2010). Another 30 percent of severe cases
occurred in the age group from 25 to 44 years and only 19 percent of
cases were over the age of 45 years. Of the 4 influenza positive
patients enrolled into the SARI sentinel surveillance programme that
have died so far in 2011, 3 were positive for influenza A(H1N1)2009
and one was positive for influenza B.

Australia and New Zealand and South Pacific
-------------------------------------------
ILI consultations have continued to rise nationally in Australia
along with notifications of laboratory confirmed influenza, most
notably in South Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. The
distribution of virus types has varied somewhat between states.
Nationally, influenza A(H1N1)2009 has accounted for the majority of
virus detections; however, 85 percent of viruses detected in the state
of South Australia have been influenza B. These accounted for the
majority of influenza B virus reported from the country as a whole.
There numbers of confirmed cases of influenza reported through the
National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System is much higher than in
the same period of 2010 (5640 to date in 2011 vs. 1088 for the same
period of 2010).

In New Zealand, the rate of national ILI consultations has not
crossed the baseline levels although some of the districts were well
above the national average. For this week, influenza B virus was the
predominant strain followed by influenza A(H3N2) virus.

>From the peer-reviewed literature:
----------------------------------
A recently published study assessed the frequency and distribution of
risk factors globally among influenza A(H1N1)2009 patients reported
during the pandemic. Risk factors were evaluated at 3 levels of
severity: hospitalization, intensive care admission, and death. The
study found that while the highest per capita risk of hospitalization
was among patients <5 years old and 5Â­--14 years old (relative risk
[RR] = 3.3 and 3.2, respectively, compared to the general population),
increasing age was associated with an increasing risk of severe
disease and death. Though infection rates were observed to be very low
in the oldest age group, as reflected in the proportion of
hospitalized cases in that group, their risk of death upon infection
was found to be higher than younger groups. The study demonstrated
that risk factors for severe influenza A(H1N1)2009 infection were
similar to those for seasonal influenza including many chronic medical
illness and pregnancy but also found some evidence to support obesity
as a risk for severe disease. The study reinforced the need to
identify and protect groups at highest risk of severe outcomes for
vaccination and early treatment. (Risk Factors for Severe Outcomes

Source of data
--------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide
and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on
available epidemiological and virological data sources, including
FluNet (reported by the Global Influenza Surveillance Network) and
influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States.
Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of
data available at the time when the update is developed.
