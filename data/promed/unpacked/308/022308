State health officials aren't calling it an outbreak but with at
least 4 cases of dengue fever in the Pearl City area [Oahu] it's a
warning for all to safeguard your home. These cases are a big concern
for the health department and the state is taking precautions.

The 4 cases have been isolated to one Pearl City neighborhood. They
involve 3 family members and a neighbor. All 4 became sick at the end
of February [2011] and have since recovered. About 70 other people
that live around them have been notified and some have taken blood
tests to see if they too have the disease [infection].

"The reason we're concerned typically we get cases any time of year
when someone comes back from Polynesia or Central America and they get
exposed to dengue [virus] and they come home and get sick. In the case
we have here these are people that have not traveled so it means
someone that did travel brought the disease home and the exposure was
here locally, by local mosquitoes," said Gary Gill, Hawaii Health
Department deputy director.

The state is not expecting a widespread outbreak. The type of
mosquito that carries the disease in Hawaii only travels about 100
yards and it has to bite an infected person then bite you in order to
spread the disease. The state's vector control branch was hit by
budget cuts. The department went from dozens of workers to just 5.
They stopped taking measures to prevent mosquitoes. The state won't
say for sure if that caused these cases.

The state is not sure how the disease was introduced in Oahu for
these cases.

[An additional Hawaii News Now report
(<http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/20110325_Dengue_fever_hits_Pearl_City.html>.)
indicated that, these 4 cases are the 1st known Hawaii cases of
locally contracted dengue fever since a 2001 outbreak in which 153
people were infected with the mosquito-borne viral illness. In that
outbreak, cases occurred on Maui, Oahu, and Kauai Islands (see
ProMED-mail archive no 20011019.2571). The vector mosquito of the Maui
outbreak at that time was _Aedes albopictus_, _Ae. aegypti_ having
been eradicated on the island in the 1940s (see ProMED-mail archive no
20010926.2348).

[2] Cases in various countries:
- Paraguay. 27 Mar 2011. The Paraguay Ministry of Health stated today
[27 Mar 2011] that so far this year [2011] at least 18 people have
died from dengue, an historical figure for [dengue cases] registered
in previous years in this South American country. According to the
director of Health Surveillance, physician Ivan Allende, in addition
to this high number of deaths, there were also 2495 confirmed cases of
this endemic disease and more than 1300 hospitalizations in the whole
country. He stated that this is the highest number of dengue deaths in
the history of Paraguay, surpassing the fatalities registered during
2007 and last year [2010], and added that some 80 per cent of the
deaths had a history of dengue. The 1300 hospitalizations also
exceeded those of past epidemics and this year there is a greater
occurrence of serious cases, although the minister of health,
Esperanza Martinez, still does not consider that it is viable to
declare a "national [health] emergency."
