Preparations for the 2015 ITU World Triathlon Edmonton are underway at Hawrelak Park in Edmonton. Alberta Health Services issued a warning 26 Aug 2015 about the dangerous levels of blue-green algae in the pond at the park where the triathlon is scheduled to take place on 5 & 6 Sep 2015.

Organizers of the ITU World Triathlon promised athletes an update within 48 hours of Wednesday to let them know if the swim portion of the race will go on.

Alberta Health Services found a blue-green algae bloom in the Hawrelak Park lake Tuesday, just 10 days before the international race comes to Edmonton.

It's unknown why the algae bloom occurred in 2015, since city staff said they haven't noticed blooms in the past. During the winter of 2013, the city drained the lake, dug a deeper swimming channel and repaired the liner in advance of last year's world final event.

A team of experts will look at every option, from draining and refilling the lake to pumping large amounts of oxygen through the water, in an attempt to get rid of the toxin in time for the race.

"It's all hands on deck for those individuals to determine how to move forward," said Rob Smyth, community and recreation facilities manager for the city. "This is absolutely critical."

Dr. Chris Sikora, medical officer of health for the Edmonton Zone, said officials visited the lake in preparation for the triathlon, but even before they took water samples, knew there was a problem.

The lake has taken on a green, pea-soup appearance, he said.

Samples came back with readings from 5000 to 1.2 million parts per millilitre, far more than the 100 000 parts per millilitre threshold considered safe.

A toxin left in the water by the algae causes an itchy rash if it comes into contact with skin. If swallowed, it can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.

"We do have time to be able to remediate," said Sikora. "If (the triathlon were) held today, it wouldn't be a good idea. ... Every swimmer I've known ingests water."

Sheila O'Kelly, general manager for the local organizing committee, said the worst-case scenario would see organizers cancel the swimming portion of the event and just have athletes bike and run, as was done once in New York. But the team will also be looking for alternate venues. The absolute last minute they can make a change is 4 p.m. the Friday before the race, when they update the approximately 1000 athletes expected to compete here in Edmonton.

The ITU world triathlon is scheduled for Hawrelak Park on 5-6 Sep 2015.

"I said, 'No, no, no!' " said athlete Paul Wallace, describing his reaction when he heard of the algae bloom.

Wallace is also the chair of the local triathlon club. The 44-year-old IT network administrator has been training 7 months to compete in his age category, hoping to earn a chance to compete at the world championship in 2016.

There are 10 spots available in each age category for the sprint distance, a tantalizing prize likely attracting athletes for miles around, he said. "If you can come in under 1 hour, 10 minutes, you have a strong shot at going to Mexico."

But swimming is his strong sport. If the 750-metre swim is cancelled, "there goes my advantage."

At noon Wednesday, Don Lowry, chair of the World Triathlon Series for Edmonton, said officials will have another update for athletes and the public in 24 to 48 hours.

Safety for the athletes will be the primary concern, he said. "Even if someone has to scratch their head and say, 'I'm not sure,' we're not going ahead."

Athletes should still be training hard, he said.

For the general public, AHS issued a health bulletin advising people to avoid contact with any visible blooms, and not to swim, wade or allow pets to enter areas where the blue-green algae can be seen.

Areas of the lake in which algae is not visible can still be used for recreational purposes, the bulletin said.

Blue-green algae, also called cyanobacteria, is naturally occurring when nutrient levels, air temperature and sunlight conditions are appropriate. It appears like scum, grass clippings, fuzz or globs on the surface of water, the advisory said, and can be blue-green, greenish-brown, brown or pinkish-red, and often smells musty or grassy.

[There are a number of very toxic blue-green algaes or cyanobacteria. The toxin may be present even if the algae is not, and likewise the algae may be present but the toxin may not. However, safety for humans and animals means avoiding bodies of water with any blue-green algae.

Athletes and many non-athletic swimmers will ingest some water despite their best efforts to avoid that. However, just swimming in water that looks like pea-green soup does not sound appealing or healthy.

There are a number of blue-green algae, many of which are toxic, frequently resulting in rapid death for animals. Blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, are a group of photosynthetic bacteria that many people refer to as "pond scum." Blue-green algae are most often blue-green in color, but can also be blue, green, reddish-purple, or brown. Blue-green algae generally grow in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams when the water is warm and enriched with nutrients like phosphorus or nitrogen.

When environmental conditions are just right, blue-green algae can grow very quickly. Most species are buoyant and will float to the surface, where they form scum layers or floating mats. When this happens, we call this a "blue-green algae bloom." Blue-green algae blooms generally occur between mid-June and late September, although in rare instances, blooms have been observed in winter, even under the ice.

Many different species of blue-green algae occur, but the most commonly detected include _Anabaena_ sp, _Aphanizomenon_ sp, _Microcystis_ sp, and _Planktothrix_ sp. It is not always the same species that blooms in a given water body, and the dominant species can change over the course of the season.

Blue-green algal toxins are naturally produced chemical compounds that sometimes are produced inside the cells of certain species of blue-green algae. These chemicals are not produced all of the time, and there is no easy way to tell when blue-green algae are producing them and when they are not. When the cells are broken open, the toxins may be released. Sometimes this occurs when the cells die off naturally and they break open as they sink and decay in a lake or pond. Cells may also be broken open when the water is treated with chemicals meant to kill algae, and when cells are swallowed and mixed with digestive acids in the stomachs of people or animals.

Typical clinical signs in dogs exposed to blue-green algae include seizures, vomiting, and/or diarrhea after contact with surface water. Although the water appears clear, if a "bloom" is just starting, it may be difficult to see any sheen, an early indication of blue-green algae formation. Some forms of blue-green algae may start forming slightly below the surface, and may not be visible, but are just as toxic.

One toxic alga frequently involved in illness and deaths is _Microcystis aeruginosa_, a single-celled blue green alga, or cyanobacterium, that occurs naturally in surface waters. _Microcystis_ can proliferate to form dense blooms and mats under certain conditions. Many variants of these cyanobacteria produce multiple toxins, including the potent liver toxin microcystin. When _Microcystis_ die, their cells break open, releasing the toxin microcystin into the water. Ingestion of water or algal cells containing microcystin has produced adverse effects in fish, dogs, cats, livestock, and humans. Sometimes the mats and the sheen of the organisms are visible on the surface of the water, if it is a pond. In larger bodies of water, such as large lakes, it may be more difficult or impossible to see the sheen or the mat of accumulation.

People swimming in dense _Microcystis_ blooms have experienced irritation such as skin rashes, burns, and blistering of the mouth. Ingestion or inhalation of water containing dense bloom material may cause vomiting, nausea, headaches, diarrhea, pneumonia, and fever. Ingestion of significant levels of the toxin microcystin can cause liver damage and dysfunction in humans and animals. No deaths from ingestion of microcystins have been reported in humans in the US; however, Brazil has reported human deaths. Dogs, wildlife, and livestock have died following exposure to this toxin.

_Microcystis_ blooms typically thrive in warm, turbid, and slow-moving waters. The blooms with the highest biomass occur in waters that are high in nitrogen or phosphorus (eutrophic waters). _Microcystis_ also requires sufficient light intensity to conduct photosynthesis, which results in blooms.

The most common route of exposure to microcystin is drinking water, followed by recreational exposures and food supplements. Typical water treatment processes do not fully remove microcystin that might be present in drinking water supplies stored in reservoirs. Swimming and playing in water that contains, or recently contained, _Microcystis_ blooms is another common exposure route. Children have the highest risk of exposure since they tend to unintentionally ingest water while swimming. Microcystin can move through the aquatic food web, exposing fish and shellfish, as well as the people who consume them. Microcystin does not remain in edible fish and shellfish tissues for more than a few weeks. However, people who frequently consume sport fish caught from a water body that supports _Microcystis_ blooms have a higher risk of exposure. Dogs can ingest large amounts of _Microcystis_ cells when they clean their coats after playing in water. Livestock, wildlife, and dogs are exposed through drinking water containing _Microcystis_ or through ingesting algal mats.
