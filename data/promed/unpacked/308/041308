Beef and dairy producers in the Gippsland [Victoria state, Australia] are being warned of an emerging disease in the region.

Theileria is thought to be spread by ticks and enters the bloodstream, causing anaemia. This reduces the animal's capacity to carry oxygen and therefore makes it ill. Other symptoms include lack of appetite.

It has been well known in the warmer areas of New South Wales and Queensland. However, the annual East Gippsland Beef conference has heard from Bairnsdale vet Dr Jade Hammer that the disease has been detected in the region.

"We have recently found a new vector tick in Gippsland and that tick has not been detected in the area before. It's likely the outbreak is due to the distribution of that tick," explained Dr Hammer, who is researching the disease as part of his studying for a Masters degree.

"It could have possibly come down with stock, but it is more likely that the climatic zones in Victoria have changed. We are now more of a subtropical climate. Ticks require higher humidity and higher rainfall."

While ticks are viewed as the main carrier, Dr Hammer is also examining other possible forms of transmission through mosquitoes and biting flies.

"Also whether farmers transmit the disease amongst cattle in their herds through reusing the same needles, ear notching between cows using the same castration knives -- all of those husbandry mechanisms of blood transfer between animals."

[Theileria are protozoan parasites carried by ticks. When ticks carrying theileria feed on cattle, the parasite gets into their bloodstream and enters red blood cells. In some animals, sufficient red blood cells are destroyed to cause anaemia -- a reduction in the red blood cell numbers. This reduces the ability of blood to carry oxygen and makes the animal ill.

A protozoan referred to as _Theileria buffeli_ has been present in Australia for around 100 years. It has been seen occasionally in blood smears of cattle from "ticky" country, but seldom caused any illness. It was considered a benign infection.

Generally ticks are the carriers (vectors) responsible for spread of theileria throughout the world. In New South Wales, the bush tick (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) is suspected to be responsible, though other ticks could be involved. Small numbers (less than 10 ticks) are able to spread the infection. Many farmers on affected properties have not observed ticks on affected cattle. Experimentally lice and march flies have also been shown to transmit infection.
