Diluting the deadly effects of anthrax - with a nice cup of tea
---------------------------------------------------------------
Scientists from a Welsh university have discovered a potential
antidote to the deadly bio-terrorism weapon anthrax -- the humble cup
of tea. The team of researchers, led by Cardiff University anthrax
expert Professor Les Baillie of the Welsh School of Pharmacy,
stumbled upon tea's ability to kill the deadly bacteria after trying
to prove its medical benefits to their American colleagues. While
working with Doctor Theresa Gallagher and her team at the Biodefense
Institute, part of the Medical Biotechnology Centre of the University
of Maryland in Baltimore, the 2 groups of scientists tested the
effects of tea and coffee on anthrax, or _Bacillus anthracis_.

Prof. Baillie said, "The discovery came out of some Friday afternoon
science. Our American colleagues were drinking vast amounts of
Starbuck's coffee and we wanted to show them how much better tea was
for you. We decided to research, under very strict laboratory
conditions, if English breakfast tea was more effective than a
commercially available American medium-roast coffee at killing
anthrax. We found that special components in tea such as polyphenols
have the ability to inhibit the activity of anthrax quite
considerably. The Chinese and Japanese have said for many, many years
about the medicinal qualities of tea and there have been studies to
show it can protect against some forms of radiation."

Having spent nearly 20 years researching anthrax -- including working
at the British Defence Science Technology Laboratory in Porton Down
for 12 years and 5 years at the US Navy Biological Defense Research
Directorate -- Prof. Baillie was pleasantly surprised at the results.
"I certainly wouldn't suggest anyone who discovers anthrax, not to
call the emergency services and just pour a cup of tea over it,"
added Prof. Baillie. "But I like the idea a nice cup of tea could
help to get you through a moment of terror. It's a very British way
of dealing with a problem."

But that's tea without milk. The scientists found that adding milk
negated tea's antibacterial qualities, leaving it useless against the
biological weapon.

Professor Baillie continued, "I would suggest that in the event that
we are faced with a potential bio-terror attack, individuals may want
to forgo their dash of milk, at least until the situation is under
control. What's more, given the ability of tea to bring solace and
steady the mind, and to inactivate _Bacillus anthracis_ and its
toxin, perhaps the Boston Tea Party was not such a good idea after all."

Researchers now hope to use their findings from studying anthrax in
America to help their understanding of _Clostridium difficile_, the
harmful bacteria which is suspected to have caused a number of
deaths, including 90 people at a hospital in Kent from April 2004 to
September 2006. The team at Cardiff University said they would like
to be able to apply their science to save lives in Wales and across
the world. [Indeed. - Mod.MHJ]

[This account of the teams' research was not absolutely clear so I
checked with Les. He replied: "Yes indeed, we looked at English
breakfast tea and as one would expect it worked in the lab on agar
plate. That's as far as we have gone." It is probably wise that they
limited their research to tea and not the possible benefits of a
single malt. On the other hand we would get into real trouble if tea
starts competing with chicken soup's effects on flu. - Mod.MHJ]
