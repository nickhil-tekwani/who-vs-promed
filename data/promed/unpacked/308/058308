The Veterinary Laboratory Agency (VLA) today announced new guidelines
to help farmers protect their stock from botulism.
Incidence of suspect botulism has increased substantially since 2003.
Evidence suggests that direct access to litter from broiler houses is
a significant factor in most of the recent outbreaks of suspected and
confirmed botulism in cattle and sheep. Litter stored or spread on
neighbouring farms may also be a factor.
The use of poultry litter containing carcasses or any carcass
material as fertiliser to spread on agricultural land is contrary to
the Animal By-Products Regulations 2005 in England, with equivalent
legislation in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Any poultry
carcasses have to be taken out before litter is removed from the poultry house.
The VLA guidelines for farmers aim to control these risks. Advice
includes not using litter on ruminant farms wherever possible and
adopting good personal hygiene when moving or spreading litter.
Other recommendations include:
-Moving stock away from direct contact and close proximity to fields
where litter has been stored or spread (as fertilizer), including on
neighbouring premises
-Not using machinery used for handling litter for storing, mixing or
moving feedstuff
-Ensuring litter stores are secure enclosed constructions to prevent
access by scavenging birds and animals, including domestic animals
and comply with relevant environmental regulations
The full guidelines, including additional advice for poultry keepers,
can be found at:

The Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (ACMSF),
an independent advisory committee advising the Food Standards Agency
(FSA) has reviewed the risks to public health associated with cattle
botulism. The available data suggest the public risks are very low.
Accordingly the FSA has suspended the need to withhold meat or milk,
from the food chain, from healthy cattle from farms affected by
suspected botulism. There is no change in the restrictions on sheep
or goats affected by suspected botulism.
The recommendations and full text of the ACMSF [draft, Sep 2006] are
available at

[Interestingly, the ACMSF Group also reviewed evidence for the
occurrence of human cases associated with meat and milk consumption
and concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that any clinical
cases of botulism were associated with consumption of meat or milk
derived from animals from herds affected by botulism. The following
conclusions and recommendations are derived from chapter 7 "Public
health advice" in the draft Report on Botulism in Cattle published by
ACMSF, September 2006:
"a. Conclusions
7.18 In view of the low apparent risk to humans presented by
botulinum toxin types C and D (which predominate in animal outbreaks)
statutory notification does not currently appear to be merited.
Although voluntary reporting of botulism outbreaks in cattle may
result in under-reporting of the disease, clinically affected animals
are likely to be investigated.
7.19 Voluntary restrictions on meat and milk from clinically
affected cattle appear appropriate but restrictions applied to
unaffected animals could be considered over-cautious. However this
would need to be reviewed if evidence emerges that toxin types such
as A, B and E (more commonly associated with humans) were causing
outbreaks in UK [and elsewhere. - Mod.AS] animal populations.
b. Recommendations
7.20 From the evidence presented to the Group, we recommend that, in
the absence of other signs, there should be no requirement to
restrict sales of milk from clinically healthy cattle from farms
where there have been clinically suspected cases of botulism in cattle.
7.21 Only animals that are healthy should be sent for slaughter for
human consumption and therefore any clinically affected animals
should not pass ante mortem meat inspection. We recommend that there
should be no requirement to restrict the slaughter of healthy cattle
from herds where cases of confirmed or suspected botulism have
occurred, but that meat and milk from clinically affected animals
should not enter the food chain due to concern that this may pose a
risk to consumers.
7.22 It would be worthwhile to undertake a small study on the
stability of toxin activity in milk, for native and proteolytically
activated toxin types A-E, with and without pasteurisation."
The situation of botulism (types C and D) from poultry-litter origin
in British cattle (and small ruminants) is common to numerous
industrialised countries. Public health aspects of the issue are,
obviously, of particular significance. Hence, the above
recommendations deserve attention elsewhere.
At present, botulism in animals is not notifiable in the UK or in the
EU and many other countries. Could this be related, among other
factors, to the difficulties associated with existing diagnostic
tests for the detection of botulinum toxins in suspected animals? - Mod.AS]
