Source: WHO/WER Notifications received from 27 Oct to 2 Nov 2000

Oman notified at the end of October 2000 one imported non-fatal case of
cholera with onset on 1 Aug 2000 (which should have been notified to WHO
within 24 hours).
As always, ProMED-mail would like to know the strain involved & the country
of origin, as this information is useful to travel agents & travel clinics
counselling travelers, physicians seeing patients returning from the
country involved, and to the public health authorities of many countries.
