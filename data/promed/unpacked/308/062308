An outbreak of salmonellosis, apparently linked to chopped liver sold by
the Oakwood delicatessen in Southgate, Enfield (North London) has caused 91
persons to fall ill. Confirmation of disease caused by _Salmonella_ sp. is
available for 10 of the victims and the remainder of the tests will be
completed shortly. Ninety percent of the victims have eaten the chopped
liver. There have been no fatalities to date, but several persons have
been hospitalized.
A number of other independent delicatessens in London, Essex and
Hertfordshire are supplied with chopped liver by the Oakwood delicatessen,
so consumers have been advised by the Enfield council, Enfield and Haringey
Health Authority and the Public Laboratory Service to check the source of
any chopped liver that they have purchased recently. The delicatessen does
not supply supermarkets or larger stores.
Public health officials are investigating to determine whether the source
of contamination was the ingredients (which include eggs) or a food
handler, and the extent to which improper food handling practices may have
been responsible.
