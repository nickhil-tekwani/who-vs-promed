H5N1 HPAI global overview February 2009
---------------------------------------
[The overview includes an introduction, stating that 250 outbreaks of
H5N1 HPAI in poultry were reported officially worldwide in February
2009 from 8 countries: Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia,
Lao People's Democratic Republic, Nepal and Viet Nam. H5N1 infections
were also confirmed in 4 wild birds in Hong Kong, China. The number
of reported outbreaks/cases by country and their geographical
location are presented graphically. Further detailed reports cover
the situation in the various regions, respectively in Africa, South
and central Asia, Southeast Asia, and Europe. For the full overview,
which includes several tables and illustrations, subscribers are
referred to the URL above. Since this FAO document was prepared in
February 2009, obviously one significant recent event, namely the
massive mortality of wild migratory birds in Qinghai, China in May
2009, due to HPAI H5N1, is not included. Here we reproduce the final
'conclusions' paragraph. - Mod.AS]

Conclusions
-----------
Since 2003, 62 countries/territories have experienced outbreaks of
H5N1 HPAI. Effective control measures for outbreaks in poultry have
been associated with reduced risk of human infections in several
countries. However, H5N1 HPAI remains entrenched in poultry in parts
of Asia and Africa (Egypt) and thus the risk of human infection
remains, as proven by the five human cases reported this month in two
countries considered endemic.

Data from previous years have shown a peak in the number of
outbreaks/cases during the January-March period in both poultry
outbreaks and human cases. In fact, February 2009 represents a peak
in this period.

It is difficult to undertake thorough epidemiological analysis of the
situation of HPAI globally, based only on official disease reporting
and the poor disease outbreak investigations carried out in some
affected countries. HPAI prevalence and incidence are likely much
greater. A number of countries that had not reported HPAI activity
for some time have faced outbreaks in the last few months. That is
the case of Cambodia, China, India, and Thailand. It remains unknown
whether these new cases are because of (a) a re-introduction of the
infection, or (b) if the virus was circulating at low level.

February 2009 showed a similar activity when compared to February
2008 both in terms of affected countries (8 vs 11) and the number of
outbreaks (86 vs 116). When compared to February 2006 and 2007,
however, HPAI activity seems to be much lower in February 2009.
February 2006 experienced a particularly high activity (33 countries
reporting 292 outbreaks/cases), reflecting when the panzootic was
spreading across Europe. Although there has been an improvement in
disease awareness, outbreaks/cases of HPAI are likely still
underestimated and under-reported in many countries and regions
because of limitations in the capacity of veterinary services to
implement adequate and effective disease surveillance for HPAI, and
because of the weakness in compensation schemes.

A recent paper reports on the phylogenetic analysis done on African
H5N1 HPAI isolates from the 11 countries affected from its emergence
in Nigeria in early 2006 to early 2008. The research group generated
494 full gene sequences from 67 African isolates and applied
molecular analysis tools to a total of 1152 A/H5N1 sequences obtained
from viruses isolated in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East between
2006 and early 2008. Detailed phylogenetic analyses of the 8 gene
viral segments confirmed that 3 distinct sub-lineages were introduced
that persisted and spread across the continent over this 2-year
period. Additionally, the molecular epidemiological studies
highlighted the association between genetic clustering and area of
origin in a majority of cases. Molecular signatures unique to strains
isolated in selected areas also gave a clearer picture of the spread
of A/H5N1 viruses across the continent. Mutations described as
typical of human influenza viruses in the genes coding for internal
proteins or associated with host adaptation and increased resistance
to antiviral drugs have also been detected. These findings raise
concern for the possible human health risk presented by viruses with
these genetic properties and highlight the need for increased efforts
to monitor the evolution of H5N1 viruses across the Africa. The paper

[The following excerpt, addressing the zoonotic aspects of the Novel
A/H1N1 epidemic, has been derived from the FAO paper 'Influenza
A/H1N1 in Humans and Swine' published in the same source as item 1
above. - Mod.AS]

----------
Avian influenza viruses, swine influenza viruses, and human influenza
viruses all belong to the same class of viruses known as
Orthomyxoviruses. Both H1N1 and H5N1 are subtypes of the influenza
type A virus. Both viruses contain the neuraminidase 1 (N1) protein
helping virus to become released from an infected host cell after
replication. While there is some similarity between the viruses, the
emerging H1N1 virus in humans does not in any direct way relate to
the HPAI H5N1 virus circulating in poultry.

Avian influenza viruses circulate in wild and sometimes also domestic
birds populations. Certain sub-types, including the highly pathogenic
H5N1, are occasionally transmitted to mammals, including humans.
Swine influenza viruses circulate in swine populations and are
occasionally, albeit infrequently, transmitted to birds and to
humans. Human influenza viruses circulate in human populations and
are transmitted from person to person. Human influenza viruses are
also transmissible to animals, pigs in particular. Pigs can therefore
harbour viruses from avian and human sources, and act as "mixing
vessels" for these viruses. An example of humans infecting pigs is
the recent case reported by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency
(CFIA) on 2 May 2009, announcing that it had found H1N1 flu virus in
a swine herd in Alberta, and that it was highly probable that the
pigs were exposed to the virus from a worker who had recently
returned from Mexico and had been exhibiting flu-like symptoms.

National authorities are encouraged to carefully investigate possible
occurrences of influenza-like events in domestic animals. Virus
samples may be collected and sent to national labs and/or
international reference centres. National authorities can always get
in touch with FAO, and by contacting
<EMPRES-Shipping-Service@fao.org>, avail of support for transporting
samples for laboratory testing. Guidance on laboratories accepting
samples for analysis, as well as the applicable regulations for the
shipment of samples to these labs can be found at the FAO website
<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/AH1N1/Guidance.html>.

In order to reduce the risk for transmission of influenza A/H1N1
(humans-to-animals or animals-to-animals), FAO recommends that
surveillance for porcine respiratory disease should be intensified
and all cases of porcine respiratory syndrome should be immediately
reported to the national veterinary authorities. The international
organizations -- OIE and FAO -- should be informed when presence of
the new A/H1N1 influenza virus is confirmed in any pig populations.
Furthermore, movement restrictions should be implemented for all
farms or holdings with swine showing signs of clinical respiratory
illness until diagnosis of the illness have been made. Where
influenza A/H1N1 is confirmed, these restrictions should be in force
until 7 days after the last animal has recovered. Animals suffering
from swine influenza can be separated from healthy herd-mates and
allowed to recover; there is no need to cull affected animals. Animal
handlers and veterinarians should wear protective gear to minimize
risk of being infected by zoonotic agents, including influenza.
Persons who work directly with swine should be urged not to go to
work if they have any signs respiratory disease, fever or any
influenza-like illness. In high risk areas a swine influenza vaccine
could be used in swine as long as it is considered effective against
the circulating strain, and is permitted by relevant authorities.

FAO is working in close coordination with the World Health
Organisation (WHO), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE),
as well as other national and international actors, to clarify and
interpret the evolution of this new disease, and advise member
countries on how to best deal with this worrying turn of events, with
maximum efficiency.

[According to the FAO overview on HPAI H5N1, this virus is currently
circulating in Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Lao
People's Democratic Republic, Nepal, and Viet Nam. These are thus the
countries in which coinfection of both H5N1 and novel A/H1N1 may
occur, particularly in pigs. The novel H1N1 virus has, so far, been
reported from 41 countries, including 2 H5N1 counties, namely China
and India. FAO's indication that "surveillance for porcine
respiratory disease should be intensified and all cases of porcine
respiratory syndrome should be immediately reported to the national
veterinary authorities" are thus of particular significance in those
2 countries. - Mod.AS]
