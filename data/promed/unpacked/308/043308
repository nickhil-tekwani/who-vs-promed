[The 2 reports above take the total number of cases reported from Jiangxi to 4 in the last few days; cases have also been reported in neighboring Guangdong region, as well as in Shandong and Henan provinces.

The sudden increase in human cases is indeed alarming and calls for strict implementation of control measures to prevent transmission events. - Mod.UBA
