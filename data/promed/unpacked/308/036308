Plague suspected in Valmont Butte prairie dogs
----------------------------------------------
A population of prairie dogs inhabiting the Valmont Butte site could
have the plague, according to Boulder County Public Health officials.

Signs were posted today [2 May 2008] at the site, warning people to
stay away from the critters as the county investigates.

Officials say the population of the rodents has declined sharply in
recent months -- a sign of possible disease.

Flea samples being collected this weekend [3-4 May 2008] will be
tested for plague. Results are expected within 2 weeks.

The city was preparing to relocate the prairie dogs after discovering
the animals have dug through soil caps meant to protect wildlife and
people from 2 toxic tailing ponds on the butte.

The city had anticipated that the population would have increased by
as much as 60 percent since last year [2007], however their numbers
have dropped by about 75 percent.

Until the test results are announced, the city will postpone any
plans to relocate prairie dogs or continue with any remediation work.

Plague is an infectious disease that can be transmitted to humans by
the bites of infected fleas or by direct contact with infected animals.

For general information about plague, call the Boulder County Public
Health Alert Line at 303-441-1460 or visit

[Praire dogs are sentinel animals for plague. They are often the 1st
indication that plague is moving through an area. Plague has often
been found in the western portions of the United States and this year
(2008) may be no exception.

It is possible the toxic trailing ponds have a legal substance to the
prairie dogs. Hopefully in addition to testing the fleas, the
authorities will be testing the trailing ponds and conducting full
necropsies on some of the prairie dogs.

We are looking forward to the results and any other information that
an authoritative source can share. - Mod.TG]
