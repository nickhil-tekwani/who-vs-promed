Increase in rabies cases in animals in Belarus
-----------------------------------------------
There has been an increase in the number of rabies cases in animals
in Belarus, starting from 1996 with 27 cases, with peaks in 2003
(1077 cases) and 2006 (1628 cases) [1, 2]. In comparison, a decade
earlier (1988-1995), only sporadic cases of rabies in animals were registered.
Although most cases of rabies in Belarus are found in foxes, raccoon
dogs are increasingly affected, with steeply increasing numbers of
cases in this species, in line with data from the World Health
Organization indicating the increased role of this animal in the
rabies epizootic in the European territory. In 1999, in Belarus,
there were 65 cases of rabies reported in foxes and 5 in raccoon
dogs, whereas in 2003, 666 foxes and 133 raccoon dogs were found to
be infected (a 10- and 27-fold increase respectively). An increase of
rabies incidence in other animal species has also been observed,
albeit to a lesser extent (grey wolves - 7-fold increase, domestic
dogs - 8-fold, domestic cats - 4-fold, farm animals - 5-fold) [1].
In 2001, a 3-year program was implemented to combat the growing
spread of rabies among animals. It consisted of 3 elements:
immunization of wild animals with oral vaccine in bait, immunization
of domestic animals, and capturing of stray dogs and cats. As a
result of these measures, the number of registered rabies cases in
animals dropped to 224 in 2004, according to the official data
provided by the Belarusian authorities [1].
However, in the following 2 years, the number of cases peaked again,
and the most recent data for January 2007 do not indicate any change
in this trend. In 2005, Belarus registered 632 cases of rabies in
animals; in 2006 this number increased sharply, reaching 1628, even
more than the previous peak noted in 2003 [2]. This year [2007], 91
cases of rabies in animals were reported in January, almost the same
number as in the same period last year (92 cases in January 2006) [3].
Data gathered by the WHO Rabies Information System shows lower
numbers of cases reported in 2005 and 2006: 591 and 849 respectively.
However, the information on 2006 is not complete and covers only the
1st half of the year [4].
Rabies cases in humans
----------------------
The incidence of rabies among animals does not seem to have affected
the number of people seeking post-exposure rabies treatment in
Belarus. During times when only sporadic cases of rabies in animals
were reported, as well as when these numbers peaked, the frequency of
requests for post-exposure rabies treatment remained rather high but
stable (around 200-250 per million population since the 1990s) [1].
On average, more than 70 percent of people needing post-exposure
rabies treatment had been bitten by dogs, approximately 14 percent by
cats, more than 2 percent by farm animals and 4.5 percent by wild
animals [1]. For vaccinating humans, cell-culture inactivated rabies
vaccine is used routinely.
Between 1951 and 2003, 135 people were reported to have died from
rabies [1]. There were no cases of rabies in humans registered in
2004 and 2005. In 2006, however, 2 people died of this illness: a
43-year-old woman bitten by a cat and a young man bitten by a raccoon
dog. Neither of them sought medical help before the onset of symptoms
[5]*. (*The epidemiological data published monthly on the website of
the Belarusian centre of hygiene, epidemiology and public health
<http://rcheph.by>
only includes rabies cases in animals. The situation in humans is
described in the official bulletin: "Rabies in the Republic of
Belarus." The most recent edition, however, covers the 1st half of
2006 and therefore does not contain information about the human
cases, both of which occurred in July.

Discussion
At present, the epizootic and epidemiologic situation in Belarus is
of concern. Due to changes in lifestyle (tourism, summer houses), the
number of people, including inhabitants of big cities and tourists,
who are in contact with potentially rabid wild or domestic animals is
growing. An additional challenge is posed by the neighboring
countries; the highest numbers of rabies cases in animals have been
in the northwestern region of Belarus, bordering Latvia and
Lithuania. In 2003, in Belarus, about 5 cases of rabies were
registered per 1000 sq/km, while in Latvia and Lithuania, the
corresponding figures were 15 and 17 respectively [1]. In 2004, all 3
countries observed a decrease in the number of reported cases, but
this downward trend continued in 2005 and 2006 only in Latvia. In
Belarus and Lithuania, the numbers of rabies cases in animals rose
again during this time [4].

[According to the Eurosurveillance report, a 3-year program,
including oral vaccination of wildlife, was implemented in 2001 to
combat the growing spread of rabies among animals in Belarus. This
was followed by a subsequent reduction of rabies cases, as recorded
in 2004. It would be helpful to note whether the oral vaccination was
continued in following years; if not, the recent deterioration of the
rabies situation, with the number of cases peaking again during
2005/2006, should not be a surprise. - Mod.AS]
