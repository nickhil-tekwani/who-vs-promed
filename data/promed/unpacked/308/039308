A rice disease suspected to be rice blast has invaded farmlands in Bauchi state. The disease, noticed in the area in the last 3 weeks, has wreaked havoc infesting about 20 hectares [about 49 acres] of rice farms across the area. "It is very difficult to assess the extent of damage to yields as the crops are at varying stages of growth," [a local official] stressed. "We have never recorded such pests in the last 4 years we have been carrying out irrigated (dry season) farming in the affected areas." He called on appropriate authorities to come to their assistance to avoid future occurrence.

An official with the department of Crop Protection, BSADP, [said] "The state is ill-prepared for the pest due to lack of information or warnings. The farmers lack knowledge and requisite skills on how to contain the damages." [He] claimed that he had visited the affected areas on different assignments [and] confirmed that significant hectares of farms were affected.

The Director, Federal Ministry of Agriculture, in charge of Bauchi, Alhaji Mohammed Yusuf, said the disease was first identified in the state over 20 years ago. "It was so prevalent then that the Japanese government assisted farmers with agrochemicals which was very effective. I am surprised that the disease has come back because for long we have not heard of it. But early detection is an advantage."

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_ (previously _Magnaporthe oryzae_). It is one of the most destructive diseases of the crop worldwide, with potential yield losses of more than 50 percent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed; infection late in the growth cycle generally leads to less severe damage. Depending on which plant parts are affected, the disease may manifest itself as leaf, collar, node, or neck blast. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

The fungus also causes wheat blast (for example, see ProMED-mail posts 20170306.4883233 and 20170123.4784298). Although the pathogens are currently classified as the same species, the wheat blast pathogen is a distinct population (referred to as _P. oryzae_ Triticum population) and does not cause disease in rice.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions, including high humidity. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilizers). The fungus is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity), water, and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence. Use of certified clean seed is essential, and farm saved seed poses a high risk of carry-over of the fungus to subsequent crops.

The report above states that an outbreak was not expected because for a long time there had been no reports of the fungus in the area. However, absence of the disease for periods of time does not safeguard against new outbreaks due to its multiple routes of spread, especially considering that the disease was reported recently from other parts of the country (ProMED-mail post 20181029.6119130). Frequent monitoring of crops is required so that control methods can be taken at the earliest possible stages of infection, to be able to prevent large scale outbreaks.
