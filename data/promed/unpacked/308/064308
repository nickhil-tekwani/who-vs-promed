Piura. - After 27 months of not having reported a single case of Foot and
Mouth Disease (FMD) in the country among livestock (sheep, steer and swine),
the National Service of Agrarian Health (Senasa) detected an outbreak of the
virus recently in the district of Marcavelica, province of Sullana, situated
approximately 40 kilometers from this city.
As an emergency measure, 161 head of livestock infected were terminated
yesterday morning.
Days before it was determined the animals of the provinces of Sullana and
Ayabaca were kept in quarantine. The disposition ended when Senasa informed
the risk was over.
According to the information from the regional coordinator of this entity
[Senasa, Eduardo Pisfil Diez, it is presumed the virus that infected the
cattle "entered with contraband livestock, coming from Ecuador, where FMD is
an endemic disease".
He specified that of the animals terminated, 54 were cattle, 17 were sheep
for skin, 4 were sheep for wool, and 86 were swine.
The Epidemiological Surveillance System of Senasa will continue working in
order to determine if there are other cases of this disease.
With respect to the destiny of the steers, Pisfil indicated that, as the
virus does not affect the meat, they incinerated pelts, heads and bones,
parts [of the animals that are directly contaminated. "There is no problem
to consume the meat; in contrast with the bones, where the virus is found in
the bone marrow", he explained.
Senasa has begun an emergency campaign to vaccinate 20 000 head of livestock
in Sullana and Ayabaca.

pleasant tasting, I have been told - Mod.TG
