Bangalore: Mysterious epidemic grips colony
2 dead, over 98 persons affected with hyper-fever,
doctors don't have a clue
------------------------------
A mysterious fever has assumed epidemic
proportions in Bijapur Colony of Lingappayya Kadu,
Mulky, near Bangalore, since Thursday.
The fever, noticed a week ago, has claimed the lives
of a one-year-old & a 5-year-old child and affected
98 people.
Nearly 63 people have been admitted as in-patients
and 35 are being treated in government hospitals, Dr
Gurusiddappa, district medical officer, told The
Times of India.
The actual number of those affected might be more
than 98. Since Mulky hospital is under repair, many
cases are being treated at private hospitals and it is
difficult even for district health officials to ascertain
the exact number of patients.
The hyper fever, which reduces a patient's immunity
for six days, has baffled the medical community.
They are checking blood samples for malaria and
typhoid but have no clue to what the fever could
be.
Dr Gurusiddappa said the patients were being treated
symptomatically. The fever had all the symptoms of
influenza, he added.
The DMO said the one-year-old had died of fever
and a bout of fits. The 5-year-old died after fever,
vomiting and diarrhoea.
He said the very young and old were particularly
susceptible to the disease since their immunity was
low. In this case, the two children were both
malnourished.
The doctor said blood samples would be sent to the
National Institute of Communicable Diseases in
Bangalore. Some samples had been sent to the
Kysanoor Forest Disease Centre in Shimoga, he
added. The results are expected within a week.
Water sources in the area are being checked for
contamination at KMC hospital here. The
Linagappayya Kaadu area has two bore wells which
are said to be polluted. Residents have been advised
to use chlorine.
Dr Gurusiddappa said some cases had been reported
from the area a few weeks ago, but the situation
reached epidemic proportions only after 21 Jan 1999.
Dr P.P. Venugopalan, head of the department of
community medicine, said the residents, who had
nomadic habits and hailed from Bijapur, might have
contracted the disease while on the move.

[Could this be yet another outbreak of the"virulent
flu" that's been going around? But Bangalore is in
south India, a long way from Afghanistan & Nepal.
This was in January; has anyone seen any followup?
