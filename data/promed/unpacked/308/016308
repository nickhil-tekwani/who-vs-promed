North Dakota State Veterinarian Susan Keller is urging ranchers in areas with a history of anthrax to take action to protect their cattle from the disease after a confirmed case in Hettinger County.

Anthrax bacteria spores that lie dormant in the ground become active under extreme weather conditions, such as flooding or drought. North Dakota typically has a few cases each year. The case in an unvaccinated beef cow in Hettinger County is the 1st this year [2013].

Keller says ranchers should consult with their veterinarians to make sure vaccinations are up to date for their animals.

As of the last communication with the herd veterinarian, 2 animals have died; one was confirmed positive for anthrax. Vaccination was underway.

We have received significantly above average rainfall throughout the state over the past several weeks.

[Hettinger County is in southwest North Dakota and away from the usual run of outbreaks in the eastern counties adjoining Minnesota. It could be that this ranch has had outbreaks in the past but either ignored them or not realised that they were from anthrax, and as a result had failed to vaccinate. I hope they have learned their lesson.

The usual pattern for North Dakota is for outbreaks to start in the last week of June, continue through August, then be sporadic in September and October. But in 2010, there was a case in mid-May 2010, and Susan Keller tells me that they had a case in March in some undefined year previous to our records, which only go back to 2005. But it has started now in North Dakota, and we can assume that a similar risk is at hand for Minnesota and South Dakota. It has been a strange year for weather in the northern US states and Canadian prairie provinces. But a comforting fact is that this outbreak involved unvaccinated stock, yet again, and this gives the veterinary authorities time to beat their drum loudly for any procrastinating rancher to get their stock vaccinated as soon as possible.
