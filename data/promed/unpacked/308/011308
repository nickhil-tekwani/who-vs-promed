Monkeypox Cases in Midwest Rise to 40
----------------------------
Health officials investigating an outbreak of monkeypox that apparently
spread from pet prairie dogs to people in 3 Midwestern states said
yesterday the number of possible cases has risen to at least 40.
In a precautionary response to the outbreak, the Allegheny County Health
Department has ordered a quarantine for 2 prairie dogs and 2 hedgehogs that
were sold in April 2003 by a pet store in northern Illinois. The health
department would not say whether the store was the same one that has been
identified as the source of the monkeypox outbreak. The county quarantine
is indefinite, but was ordered solely as a precaution. The Health
Department has no reason to believe the animals were ever infected with
monkeypox virus, according to spokesman Guillermo Cole. "The animals are in
good health," Cole said. "They are well past the 12-day incubation period
for developing illness and spreading monkeypox virus."
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 4 confirmed human
cases yesterday of monkeypox virus infection, a smallpox-related virus that
has never before appeared in the Western Hemisphere. 7 people have been
hospitalized; no one has died. Steve Ostroff, deputy director of the CDC's
National Center for Infectious Diseases, said he expects the numbers to
rise as human and animal samples are tested. But Ostroff said that only
people who had direct contact with infected prairie dogs, or in one case a
rabbit [that was in contact with a sick prairie dog], have come down with the
illness. "For the average citizen, I would not necessarily be concerned at
this point of being exposed to monkeypox," he said.
State health officials have reported 19 suspected cases in Wisconsin, 13 in
Indiana, and 4 in Illinois. 4 cases have been confirmed in Wisconsin and
Illinois.
Investigators said the prairie dogs were probably infected with the virus
by a Gambian giant rat, which is native to Africa, at a Chicago-area pet
distributor. The Illinois Department of Agriculture, along with state and
federal health officials, is trying to track down 115 customers -- both
individuals and pet stores -- that bought exotic animals from Phil's Pocket
Pets since 15 Apr 2003. The distributor, Phillip Moberley, said yesterday
that he voluntarily quarantined his home-based business and put to death 70
prairie dogs.
The Allegheny County animals will be quarantined in the homes of the 2
residents who purchased them. There is no evidence that any people here
were sickened by the animals, Cole said. The prairie dogs were sold to a
pet store owner, who kept one of the animals on display in his store and
the other in his home. The prairie dog on display had no contact with other
animals, Cole said. The hedgehogs went to a woman who bought them as pets.
Aside from their owner, the animals have had contact only with the woman's
cat, which is in good health. "It's not clear to us whether hedgehogs can
be infected," Cole noted. [Hedgehogs belong to the Order Insectivora and
are unrelated to any of the rodents displaying signs of disease. - Mod.CP]
Monkeypox in humans is not usually fatal but causes rashes, fevers, and
chills. Doctors initially feared they might be facing smallpox, which
causes similar symptoms. 2 patients at Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital
in Milwaukee were reported in satisfactory condition Sunday. The 2 were
isolated, and doctors treating them wore caps, gowns, and masks. Other
suspected victims were treated and released.
Health officials are trying to contain the virus by preventing more animals
from becoming infected. Wisconsin's Department of Agriculture warned people
not to release prairie dogs into the wild. The agency also told state
humane societies to isolate any prairie dogs people bring in. Both
Wisconsin and Illinois have banned the sale, importation, and display of
prairie dogs. The Illinois ban also covers Gambian rats.
The popularity of prairie dogs as pets has grown in recent years. Last year
10 000 prairie dogs were shipped out of Texas to become pets, said David
Crawford, executive director of Rocky Mountain Animal Defense.
