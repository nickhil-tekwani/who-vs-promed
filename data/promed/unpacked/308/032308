An outbreak of avian influenza H5N1 was detected last week in a backyard flock in the Dordogne, marking the return to France of this potentially deadly virus to humans, more than 8 years after the last confirmed cases.

Bird flu has reappeared in particular in hens raised for personal consumption in Biras, said the prefect of Dordogne, Christophe Bay, at a press conference last Wed 25 Nov 2015. The government has just announced 2 new cases on 30 Nov 015, according to FranceTV Info. The Veterinary Services Department was alerted Fri 20 Nov 2015 after the death of the 30 birds. Analyses revealed the presence of virus, probably transmitted by wild ducks, according to the prefecture. Survivors were euthanized and the backyard disinfected. The samples were sent to the National Health Security Agency (ANSES), which confirmed on Tuesday the 1st results.

"This is a highly pathogenic H5N1 in poultry, 'appearing corresponding [similar?] to' a strain detected already in Europe that presented a previously LPAI [low-pathogenic] profile," said the Ministry of Agriculture in a statement. The risk of [transmission] to humans of this strain is not established at this stage. The Ministers of Agriculture, Stephane Le Foll, and health, Marisol Touraine, said "as a precautionary measure, it will be necessary to evaluate the potential dangerousness of the strain to humans."

Bird flu is however "not transferable to humans through the consumption of meat, eggs, foie gras, or more generally any food product," the ministry said. "This virus has no effect in terms of consumption of anything derived from poultry products," said Mr Le Foll, also spokesman for the government, from the council for ministers.

"Poultry that have been slaughtered are healthy. Sick poultry do not reach the slaughterhouse," said Denis Lambert, head of the poulterer LDC, showing its confidence in "the quality of French veterinary services. We will identify the area and there is no reason to extend it."

As expected in this situation, the Government has activated the national health emergency response plan. In Biras a protection zone of 3 km has been set up around the site, [within which] all pets must be confined, including dogs and cats, "to prevent any further spread," said Mr. Bay. 2 other Dordogne farms have been placed under special surveillance; the usual checks have revealed high levels of antibodies, suggesting that the birds were in contact with the disease, reported the prefect. [Specifically, these are] breeding geese in Domme, 90 km south of Biras, and a duck farm in Saint-Paul-la-Roche, 50 km north.

The most recent crisis caused by the H5N1 virus in France dates back to early 2006. After destroying all the poultry in a factory farm in Ain, the government of the time imposed the general containment of birds and free-range poultry held by individuals on the entire territory for 3 months. During this period, 64 cases were confirmed [among the] dead birds found, almost all in Ain. The latest isolated cases were detected in Moselle in the summer of 2007 among swans and wild ducks. Since its revival in Southeast Asia in late 2003, bird flu has killed 449 people out of 844 confirmed cases, mostly in Egypt, Indonesia and Vietnam, according to the latest report of the World Health Organization (WHO).

[The initial outb5eak of this continuing event was reported to the OIE on 25 Nov 2015 (see 20151125.3819479).

H5N1 HPAI was last reported in France in wild ducks in August 2007 in Lorraine, Moselle, eastern France. All H5N1 HPAI viruses detected in Europe since 2005 are derived from the common progenitor A/goose/Guandong/1/96 lineage of Asian origin.

H5N1 LPAI of the European lineage has been isolated sporadically from both poultry and wild birds in Europe.

Results of epidemiological investigations into the source of infection on the 3 holdings, and results of genotyping the virus strain(s) involved, are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
