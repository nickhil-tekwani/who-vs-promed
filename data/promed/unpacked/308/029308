The Cooch Behar district health department is already forming special teams with health workers. The team includes health workers, as well as municipal and gram panchayat [village council] workers. They are roaming around the area and collecting the blood of those suffering from fever. Did you have a fever? Then it's not too late. Go to the doctor now. This is what experts advise the residents of Cooch Behar in West Bengal.

The reason for this is that scrub typhus has increased the concern in this district of North Bengal. According to the district health department, as of May this year [2022], there were close to 60 cases of scrub typhus. Along with [coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and] monkeypox, scrub typhus is increasing the concern in Bengal. Suddenly, the number of scrub typhus cases in Cooch Behar district has started increasing. In the last few months, the number of scrub typhus cases in the district (Cooch Behar) has crossed 80. The district health department has been rushed to deal with the situation.

The health department officials are hopeful that scrub typhus cases will be found and the prevalence of the disease can be prevented only if the public is aware.

According to the district health department, last year [2021], the number of cases of scrub typhus was 4. This time in the 1st 5 months, the reason for the increase in the number by almost 15x [if the current total cases in 2022 are actually 80, that is 20x last year's total of 4 cases], the health officials of the district say that more tests are done.

Scrub typhus causes:
Doctors say that just as dengue is [transmitted by the bite of] the _Aedes_ mosquito, the scrub typhus bacteria [_Orientia tsutsugamushi_] enter the body by the bite of a type of insect [actually not an insect, but the larvae, called chiggers,] of trombiculid mites. If caught [early], it is possible to quickly deal with scrub typhus [with antibiotic therapy]. Scrub typhus [can] become life-threatening when the diagnosis is delayed.

[Cooch Behar is a city (pop., almost 78 000 residents in 2011) in the Indian state of West Bengal and is the headquarters of the Cooch Behar district (about 2.8 million residents in 2011), in the foothills of the Eastern Himalayas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooch_Behar). A map showing the location of Cooch Behar district can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cooch+Behar,+West+Bengal,+India.

Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation.

Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ in nature (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/12/03-0212_article).

Endemic regions for scrub typhus extend from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and the Indian subcontinent, and westward to Pakistan and Afghanistan (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5687757/).

Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and eschar at the site of the chigger bite; regional lymphadenopathy occurs at the site of the bite and may lead to generalized lymphadenopathy (https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/231374-clinical).

Other than the necrotic skin lesion at the site of mite inoculation (the eschar), scrub typhus has no distinctive clinical features to make an accurate clinical diagnosis and the presence of an eschar in patients has been reported to vary widely. Confirmation of the diagnosis requires laboratory testing, but we are not told in the news report above how the diagnosis was made in these patients from West Bengal. The Weil-Felix test is commonly used to make the diagnosis of rickettsial infections, including scrub typhus, in resource-limited areas where more current diagnostic methods are not available (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559225/). The Weil-Felix test is an agglutination reaction based on the fact that certain serotypes of _Proteus_ bacteria display antigenic cross-reactivity with _Rickettsia_ species. This test has largely been replaced due to its low sensitivity and specificity with new serological techniques. For example, false positive results have been seen in 54% of healthy volunteers and 62% of non-rickettsial fever patients with the Weil-Felix test (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trstmh.2008.11.020).

The gold standard for diagnosis of rickettsial infections is indirect immunofluorescent IgG antibody assays of paired serum samples (one taken during the acute phase of the disease and one taken 2 to 4 weeks later in the convalescent phase) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559225/). Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region like India. Having an accurate, available, and affordable point-of-care diagnostic test for scrub typhus would be important to avoid unnecessary or inappropriate antibiotic therapy (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5892940/#abstract-2title).

Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline in both adults and children (https://www.cdc.gov/typhus/healthcare-providers/index.html), and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting results of laboratory confirmation. - Mod.ML
