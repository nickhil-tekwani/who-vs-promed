Dog with rabies put down in Amsterdam
-------------------------------------
Health officials in Amsterdam have tracked down at least 50 people who have been in contact with a puppy found to have rabies, news agency ANP reported on Fri 17 Feb 2012.

The puppy, aged 8.5 weeks, arrived in the Netherlands several days ago from Morocco via Spain.

The dog had a microchip and a certificate of good health. It has since been put down.

The last case of rabies in the Netherlands was in 1991.

[The details of this incident are sparse. It is unclear when the puppy left Morocco, the means of its transportation through Spain, and how many people had contact with the animal during its journey to the Netherlands through Spain.

In 2008 importation of a rabid dog from Morocco resulted in a chain of transmission of canine rabies in France. In the preceding 7 years 9 rabid dogs have been illegally introduced in France. All but one had been imported from Morocco through Spain.

It would seem that there are still unresolved surveillance issues relating to the importation of animals from North Africa into northern Europe through Spain. - Mod.CP
