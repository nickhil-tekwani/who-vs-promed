Smallpox shot infects soldier's toddler son
-----------------------------------------------
In the 1st case of its kind in years, a 2-year-old boy is being
treated in Chicago for a rare and life-threatening infection that he
contracted from his father, a U.S. Army soldier recently vaccinated
against smallpox. The Indiana boy is in critical condition with
eczema vaccinatum, an unusual side effect of the smallpox vaccine
that can affect [unusually susceptible] people who receive the shot
or their close contacts.
Doctors also said the boy appears to have passed the infection to his
mother, who has a much milder case of the virus in the smallpox
vaccine, which is also called vaccinia virus. The virus is not
smallpox, though it is similar enough to offer protection from that
deadly disease, which was declared eradicated in 1980.
The mother and child are being treated at the University of Chicago's
[U. of C] Comer Children's Hospital, which withheld their names at
the family's request. There is no infection risk for the general
population, government officials say, since the vaccine virus can
spread only through close physical contact.
But the boy's diagnosis last week has prompted a frenzy of activity
and daily conference calls involving the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention [CDC], the U.S. Department of Defense, and the
state and city public health departments. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration [FDA] gave emergency authorization for the hospital to
treat the boy with ST-246, an experimental drug for smallpox that is
untried as a therapy in humans.
The smallpox vaccine fell out of general use in the 1970s, but the
case could be a lesson for the U.S. military, which has vaccinated
1.2 million personnel against smallpox since 2002 amid fears of bioterrorism.
It's unclear why the father was allowed to have contact with his son,
who had a history of eczema, shortly after the vaccination. The skin
condition is a well-known risk factor for eczema vaccinatum, and
official guidelines warn that people with eczema should avoid contact
with vaccinees. "We are looking into how this could have happened,"
said U.S. Army spokesman Paul Boyce.
Officials say the general population could receive smallpox
vaccinations in the event of a bioterrorist attack or other
unforeseen exposure. For that reason, experts want to study the
Indiana family to learn more about treatment and transmission of the
vaccinia infection. "There certainly are also conceivable insights
into smallpox infection," said Dr. Inger Damon, chief of the CDC's
poxvirus and rabies branch. Damon has been involved in the daily
conference calls on the boy's treatment. Experts said they knew of no
cases of eczema vaccinatum since at least 1990, when the military
last had a program of smallpox vaccination. The vaccinia virus in
modern smallpox vaccines is closely related to an older form of
vaccinia called cowpox, the disease English doctor Edward Jenner used
in the late 1700s to develop early methods of vaccination. Jenner
relied on the observation that milkmaids who had cowpox seemed to be
protected from later smallpox infection. He found that patients
inoculated with material from cowpox sores also got protection from
smallpox. That history is why the word vaccine stems from the Latin
word for cow. Vaccinia was modified from its original form over the
years but remains an infectious agent with the potential for side effects.
The father of the Indiana boy received the vaccine in late January
2007 before a planned military deployment. The Army delayed his
departure and permitted him to visit his family in mid-February 2007.
Two weeks later, a rash broke out on the boy's skin. He came to the
U. of C. on 3 Mar 2007 after being transferred from St. Catherine's
Hospital in East Chicago. Doctors 1st identified his widespread rash
as a different form of eczema, but it worsened in his 1st few days at
the U. of C. His mother developed sores after she and her son arrived
at the Chicago hospital. Doctors believe she contracted the disease
from the boy because of their lengthy close contact.
A pediatric dermatologist, Dr. Sarah Stein, noticed the boy's lesions
had changed to look like round blisters with a dimple in the middle,
a potential sign of vaccinia infection. The medical team took
scrapings from the lesions, which they analyzed and sent to the
Illinois Department of Public Health's Chicago office for further
testing. Rapid tests by the state and further tests at the CDC
confirmed the boy had the vaccinia virus, officials at those agencies
said. The hospital also sent the CDC photos of the boy's lesions.
The hospital already was using infection precautions with the boy,
but staffers then added such measures as gloves and face masks. They
also placed the boy in a room with negative pressure so the air would
always blow inward, keeping the virus inside. The boy's rash had
spread to cover 80 percent of his body, said Dr. Madelyn Kahana,
chief of pediatric intensive care medicine at the U. of C. He was
going into sepsis, a devastating, system-wide infection rarely seen
with viral cases. "In the later stages of [eczema vaccinatum], it can
look like smallpox," said Damon of the CDC. The boy needed a
ventilator to help his breathing because of the powerful pain
medication he needed for the lesions.
The boy received the primary treatment for eczema vaccinatum, a drug
called vaccinia immune globulin, or VIG. The drug came from a
stockpile the CDC keeps in case widespread vaccination ever becomes
necessary. He also got an antiviral drug called cidofovir and the
experimental drug ST-246, which has been shown to protect laboratory
animals from exposure to smallpox. The drug recently entered
preliminary human trials but had never been used in a sick patient.
U. of C. officials said the boy has shown signs of improvement since
hitting a low point last weekend. His mother's health was never in
serious danger, but she has remained in his hospital room to keep
others from being exposed. Health officials in Chicago and Indiana
have tracked all of the family's contacts and found no additional
cases so far. Kahana said the boy probably will lose 20 percent of
his outer skin layer, but she hopes he will recover without the need
for skin grafts. She believes the case should be a lesson to the
military, which must educate service members about the risks of the
vaccines it requires them to take. "I think the information simply
wasn't disseminated properly or impressed in a manner that was
understood," Kahana said, "because I don't think anyone would
knowingly expose their child to this."

Dad's smallpox shot infects son, 2; Experimental drugs bring Indiana
boy back from brink of death
-----------------------------------------------
A 2-year-old boy stricken with a rare infection from the smallpox
vaccine is improving but remained in critical condition Saturday [17
Mar 2007] at the Comer Children's Hospital at the University of
Chicago [U. of C.]. The boy was infected by his father, a U.S.
soldier who was vaccinated in January 2007 in preparation for service
in Iraq. But his deployment was delayed, and he returned home to
Indiana late last month. His son, who suffers from skin lesions known
as eczema, then became infected by vaccinia, a virus similar to
smallpox and used in the vaccine against it.
The boy is the 1st person to suffer from the severe infection, known
as eczema vaccinatum since the U.S. military began inoculating troops
in 2002. But his condition is so uncommon that U. of C. experts said
they could not find reports of any cases in the United States since
before 1972, when routine vaccinations for smallpox were halted.
"This is something that is new to us," said Kenneth Alexander, head
of pediatric infectious disease at U. of C. The boy, whose name was
not released, was sent to U. of C. from a northwest Indiana hospital
on 3 Mar 2007 after he developed a severe rash. He didn't improve
after treatment, and by 7 Mar 2007, a dermatologist noticed his
lesions resembled those caused by smallpox, something doctors had
only seen in photos because the disease was eradicated.
Doctors contacted the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention [CDC], which agreed to fly in a treatment never used on a
child, vaccinia immune globulin (VIG). The drug was hand-delivered by
U.S. marshals.
The boy's condition continued to worsen, and last weekend, his lungs
and kidneys began to fail. "He was near death," said Madelyn Kahana,
chief of pediatric critical care medicine. Painful skin lesions
covered most of his body.
The CDC then asked the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] to grant
emergency permission to try ST-246, an experimental drug being
developed to fight smallpox. It had been effective in treating mice
and monkeys infected with the virus, said U. of C. pediatrician John
Marcinak, who is spearheading the boy's treatment. But it had never
been used on a sick person. That, combined with VIG and another drug,
seems to be working. Since he 1st got the drug on 11 Mar 2007, "he is
slowly improving," Marcinak said.
The boy's mother contracted a milder form of the vaccinia virus from
the boy and has been quarantined in the boy's room but is recovering
well, officials said.
Doctors said the father -- who has since returned from his deployment
at the hospital's urging -- had no idea he should stay away from his
son after receiving the vaccine. Kahana said the "military has to be
careful" in making sure soldiers understand the risks and that they
stay away from high-risk populations, such as people with
eczema. "They are trying to figure out where the misstep was," she
said of the military. A military spokesman could not be reached
Saturday [17 Mar 2007].
The boy has 2 siblings, but no one else appears to have been
infected, doctors said. The hospital has taken extreme precautions in
treating the boy, including keeping him in a room where the air only
flows inward. Officials say the general public is not at risk because
the infection is only transmitted through close physical contact.

ProMED-mail
<promed@promedmail.org>
[Following the intentional release of anthrax spores [in letters] in
the USA in October 2001, the USA decided to embark upon vaccination
campaigns with the smallpox vaccine. During the period leading up to
the vaccination activities, ProMED-mail had significant coverage of
the discussions on the risks and benefits of using the smallpox
vaccine that was available at that time (and is still the vaccine being used).
In a prior ProMED-mail posting Smallpox vaccine, ACIP recommendations
- USA (02) 20020621.4560, this moderator presented a discussion on
the risks of vaccination with the currently available vaccine. Kemper
et al. did a "back of the envelope" presentation of possible risks
associated with smallpox vaccination for the Effective Clinical
Practice, March/April 2002 issue of the American College of
Physicians (ACP) journal. They concluded:
"After excluding high-risk individuals and their contacts, we
estimate that a vaccination strategy directed at people aged one to
29 years would result in approximately 1600 serious adverse events
and 190 deaths. Vaccinating people aged one to 65 years would result
in approximately 4600 serious adverse events and 285 deaths.
Limitations: While advances in health care over the past 3 decades
could mitigate vaccine complications, the increased number of
un-immunized high-risk individuals (e.g., those with eczema or immune
suppression) could increase complication rates."
They then went on to discuss the limitations and additional dangers
to "high-risk" individuals of a mass immunization campaign. "We
assumed that individuals would be screened before vaccination for
risk factors, such as eczema, immunodeficiency, or pregnancy, in
themselves or in their close contacts. The prevalence of eczema and
the number of immunocompromised individuals have increased over the
past 3 decades. High-risk populations would be excluded from
vaccination, as would their potential contacts, since recent vaccine
recipients are "infectious" and can transmit the virus (vaccinia).
Individuals with eczema are at high risk for developing eczema
vaccinatum. The prevalence of eczema is at least 10 percent, or more
than 28 million people in the United States. Immunocompromised
persons are at high risk for progressive vaccinia. We know of no
overall estimate for the number of immunocompromised individuals in
the United States. This number would include recipients of organ
transplants (184 000 solid-organ transplants in the 1990s),
individuals with diagnosed and undiagnosed HIV infection or AIDS (850
000), and patients with cancer (approximately 8.5 million). We
estimate, therefore, that in the entire U.S. population as many as 10
million individuals (3.6 percent) may be at increased risk for
developing progressive vaccinia.
Therefore, approximately 15 percent of the population may have
increased risk for a direct adverse event after smallpox vaccination.
In addition to exclusion of these individuals from vaccination,
persons in close contact with them should not be vaccinated to avoid
inadvertent transmission and subsequent indirect adverse events.
Close contacts would include, at minimum, household members.
Insufficient data are available to estimate precisely the number of
close contacts who would be excluded from a vaccination campaign. We
estimate that another 10 percent of the population would be excluded.
On the basis of the foregoing, we further estimate that 25 percent of
the population would be excluded from vaccination because of high
risk or the possibility of coming in contact with a high-risk individual"
<http://www.acponline.org/journals/ecp/marapr02/kemper>.
The incident discussed in this current posting relates to a vaccine
recipient exposing a family member with a disease that is a known
high risk for complications following vaccination with the smallpox
vaccine (eczema in an individual or close contact of an individual is
a reason to self exclude from receipt of smallpox vaccine). Self
exclusion from events for medical reasons involves a very complicated
set of issues for the individual who needs to self exclude. In the
above incident, the father theoretically should have self excluded
from receipt of the vaccine, or if not, should not have gone to his
home to expose his son (and wife) to the vaccine virus. But how easy
is/was it for a military recruit about to be deployed to (1) self
exclude from the vaccination (and risk losing his deployment
possibilities and possible promotions related to the service) and (2)
refuse to visit with his family prior to deployment that would
theoretically remove him from the possibility of seeing his family for months?
One is also reminded of a generalized vaccinia infection that
occurred in Israel during their vaccination campaign in 2002. In the
prior ProMED-mail posting Smallpox vaccination strategy - Israel (03)
20021222.6113, we carried the following: "An Israeli surgeon ignored
warnings that people should not be vaccinated if someone at home has
low immunity. His wife was on medication that lowers immunity. The
surgeon infected her with the vaccinia virus, a cousin of smallpox."
Again, reasons for non-appropriate self exclusion are very complex.
The occurrence of a secondary contact case in the above household
suggests that perhaps the mother of the child may have had a similar
predisposing immune disorder, making her at risk of contact for
vaccinia infection as well.
As the risk of infection with variola virus is presently a
theoretical risk of intentional release of smallpox virus as part of
a biological warfare act, the risk of adverse events from the use of
the current vaccine remains significantly higher. A question that
comes to mind is whether we are any closer to having a safer vaccine
for use among those individuals felt to be at high risk of early
exposure to intentionally released smallpox virus. - Mod.MPP]
[Report [2] above indicates that the soldier did not self-exclude for
selfish reasons, but because he had not heard of any
contra-indication to exposing his son. However, the potential
problems with self-exclusion discussed above remain valid. - Mod.JW.]
