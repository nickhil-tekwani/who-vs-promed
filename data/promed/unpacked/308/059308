NSW Health is urging the community to stay vigilant and take precautions against mosquito bites after a 5th NSW resident was confirmed to have Japanese encephalitis (JE).

The confirmed case is a man aged in his 60s from Goulburn. He was treated in hospital before being discharged and is continuing to recover in a rehabilitation facility.

This is the 1st confirmed case from the Goulburn area. Urgent investigations into the location of his exposure are underway.

Several more people in NSW are currently undergoing further testing for JE and more cases are expected to be confirmed over the coming days and weeks.

Locally acquired cases of JE have never previously been identified in NSW in animals or humans. Since late February 2022, the JE virus has been confirmed in samples from pig farms in NSW, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia.

The JE virus is spread by mosquitoes and can infect animals and humans. The virus cannot be transmitted between humans, and it cannot be caught by eating pork or other pig products.

There is no specific treatment for JE, which can cause severe neurological illness with headache, convulsions and reduced consciousness in some cases.

The best thing people throughout the state can do to protect themselves and their families against JE is to take steps to avoid mosquito bites.

Simple actions you can take include:
- Avoid going outdoors during peak mosquito times, especially at dawn and dusk, and close to wetland and bushland areas.
- Wear long sleeves and pants outdoors (reduce skin exposure). Also wear shoes and socks where possible. There are insecticides (e.g. permethrin) available for treating clothing for those spending extended periods outdoors.
- Apply repellent to all areas of exposed skin, especially those that contain DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus which are the most effective against mosquitoes. The strength of a repellent determines the duration of protection with the higher concentrations providing longer periods of protection. Always check the label for reapplication times.
- Reapply repellent after swimming. The duration of protection from repellent is also reduced with perspiration, such as during strenuous activity or hot weather so it may need to be reapplied more frequently.
- Apply the sunscreen 1st and then apply the repellent. Be aware that DEET-containing repellents may decrease the sun protection factor (SPF) of sunscreens so you may need to re-apply the sunscreen more frequently.
- For children in particular -- most skin repellents are safe for use on children aged 3 months and older when used according to directions, although some formulations are only recommended for children aged 12 months and older -- always check the product. Infants aged younger than 3 months can be protected from mosquitoes by using an infant carrier draped with mosquito netting that is secured along the edges.
- If camping, ensure the tent has fly screens to prevent mosquitoes entering.
- Mosquito coils and other devices that release insecticides can assist in reducing mosquito bites but should be used in combination with topical insect repellents.
- Reduce all water holding containers around the home where mosquitoes could breed. Mosquitoes only need a small amount of liquid to breed.

[Transmission of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus remains active in New South Wales. The number of reported human JE cases in the state has increased from 2 on 7 Mar 2022 to 5 today (11 Mar 2022). No reports have been issued yet of the frequency and locations where JE virus has been found in vector mosquitoes, although vector surveillance is doubtless going on. Given the reports of flooding and rains in eastern Australia, mosquito populations are likely to remain abundant with ongoing JE virus transmission to people and pigs. Avoidance of mosquito bites as recommended above is the only preventive measure, other than vaccination, for people to avoid JE virus infections. - Mod.TY]
