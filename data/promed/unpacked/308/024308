Bird flu re-emerges in Thai fowl, spreads in southern Viet Nam
-----------------------------------------------
Bird flu resurfaced in Thailand and spread to a 7th Vietnamese province in
a fresh wave of poultry outbreaks in Asia. Officials in Egypt are testing a
20 year old woman suspected of being the country's 19th case.
The H5N1 strain of avian influenza killed ducks in a northern Thai
province, the 1st outbreak reported in more than 5 months in the world's
4th-largest poultry-exporting country. The virus also infected ducks in
Viet Nam's southern Soc Trang province, after re-emerging in fowl in Japan
last week.
The new infections signal a resurgence of outbreaks similar to last year
[2006], when the virus spread to more than 30 countries in the 1st quarter.
Infections in birds and people are increasing, particularly in Asia, where
the virus was 1st identified a decade ago. Hong Kong, South Korea and
Nigeria have reported diseased birds in the past month, while Indonesia,
China and Egypt found new human cases.
A 20 year old woman is being treated for suspected avian flu at a hospital
in Fayoum, south west of Cairo, the government-run newspaper Al-Ghomhuria
reported, without citing a source for the information. A 23 year old woman
died from virus in the same province, Al-Ghomhuria said. The WHO office in
Cairo and Egypt's Health Ministry wouldn't confirm the report. The health
ministry also found 4 poultry outbreaks in the delta governorate of
Qaliyoubia, in northern Egypt, the newspaper said.
Thailand's Agricultural Ministry said about 2100 poultry were culled to
contain an outbreak in the province of Phitsanulok, about 377 km (234
miles) north of the capital, Bangkok. Outbreaks in the South East Asian
country last year [2006] killed 3 people in July and August.
Japan's agriculture minister Toshikatsu Matsuoka will return early from a
visit to the United States to assist officials in containing an outbreak on
the southern island of Kyushu, where 3900 chickens died of the disease and
more than 8000 fowl were culled.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries plans to release a
preliminary report of an investigation into the outbreak, which occurred on
a farm in Miyazaki prefecture, vice minister Yoshio Kobayashi told
reporters in Tokyo today [15 Jan 2007].

Thailand has 1st bird flu outbreak in 6 months
----------------------------------------------
Thailand has suffered its 1st outbreak of the H5N1 bird flu virus in 6
months, an Agriculture Ministry official said on Monday [15 Jan 2007],
after a rash of outbreaks in Viet Nam and 4 human deaths in Indonesia this
year. "The lab results confirmed that some ducks in the northern province
of Phitsanulok have been infected with H5N1 bird flu virus," Livestock
Department chief Pirom Srichan told Reuters. "We have culled about 1900
ducks in the area."
The last outbreak of the virus in poultry in Thailand was in late July 2006.

Govt bans commercial animal husbandry in residence areas
--------------------------------------------------------
The government banned on Monday [15 Jan 2007] the presence of commercial
animal husbandry in residence areas, Elshinta radio station reported. The
decision was made to limit the spreading of bird flu virus, which has
claimed 4 lives in Jakarta last week. The radio station stated that the
government would ask the local government to issue bylaw to implement its
decision.
An official from Tangerang regency said that a regency administration would
need one or 2 months to issue a bylaw as an approval from the legislative
council was also required.

[The reemergence of H5N1 during the winter season might be another
indication of the possible though controversial role wild birds may play in
its spread. It will be interesting to follow the data obtained in the
coming weeks by the European Union's H5N1 surveillance in wild birds.
According to the results obtained during 2006 by the said surveillance in
the 14 participating member states, a total of 748 H5N1 infected wild birds
were identified and notified from 1 Feb to 30 Nov 2006. Their occurrence
was restricted to the months February to May 2006. The figures were: Feb
200; Mar 362; Apr 166; May 18; Jun 0; Jul 1; Aug 1; Sep 0; Oct 0; Nov 0.
The ADNS summary report for highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild
birds, including the data pertaining to each state and to each of the 5
bird groups (swans, ducks, geese, birds of prey and "others"), is available
at <http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/adns/adns_wildbirds.pdf>. -
