This is the newest and up-to-date report on Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever
in IRAN, from the Arboviruses and Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers Laboratory
(National Center) of the Pasteur Institute of Iran, in Tehran. This completes
our report published on ProMED in May 2004 [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever,
2004 - Iran 20040517.1324].
For the period 1 Jan to 22 Aug 2004 the total number of suspected cases was
53. Among the 53 suspected cases from different provinces of Iran we found 12
IgM antibody-positive and 8 RT-PCR-positive, and there was one death among
the confirmed cases. The province of Sistan and Baluchistan [had the highest
number of infections] in Iran during this period.
