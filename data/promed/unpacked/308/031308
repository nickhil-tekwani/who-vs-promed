MENINGITIS & MENINGOCOCCAL INFECTION - TEXAS, USA (2)
=====================================================
There have been recent discussions on meningococcal disease activity,
specifically the activity in the state of Florida, and a request for
information on meningococcal disease activity in the state of Texas.
The preliminary number of invasive meningococcal disease cases
reported in Texas in 1995 is 256. Below lists the number of cases
and incidence rate for each year since 1982. Historical data for
meningococcal disease in Texas shows a cyclic trend of increasing
number of cases every 10-12 years. Typically, incidence rates in
children are higher compared with adults. In 1994, the rate per
100,000 children under one year of age was 11.0; in 1-4 year olds,
3.9; in 5-9 year olds, 2.3; in 10-14 year olds, 1.0. Rates for age
groups over 15 years of age are usually 1.0 or less. A high
percentage (57%) of cases occurred in the winter months of January,
February, March, Novermber, and December.
In 1994, 149 Neisseria meningitidis isolates were serotyped at the
Texas Department of Health laboratory. Sixty percent were group C;
28% were group B; 9% were group Y; and 3% were group W135.
Recent community-wide outbreaks with Group C have occurred in counties
in East and North Texas. These outbreaks have lasted several months.
Increased activity in Gregg County (106,000 population) in East
Texas occurred from March 1994 through October 1995. A total of 28
cases occurred primarily in children and adults less than 29 years of
age. From March 1994 through October 1995 over 30,000 county
residents received meningococcal vaccine.
