MEASLES, IMPORTED - USA ex PHILIPPINES: ALERT
**********************************
A ProMED-mail post

A 24-year-old woman from the Philippines arrived at JFK Airport [New York,
USA] at approximately 1 PM on 17 Jan 2003 after a 4-hour stopover at Narita
Airport in Japan to visit family. She was on a Northwest airlines flight
from Manila to Tokyo, and the flight from Tokyo, Japan to JFK was another
Northwest airlines non-stop flight. Within hours of arrival, she had a
temperature of 104, cough, rhinitis, sore throat, and conjunctivitis.
Within 2 days she developed a morbilliform rash starting on her face and
proceeding downward, reaching her legs by the third day of the rash. She
gave a vague history of having measles at age 3 and never received a
measles-mumps-rubella immunization. She was diagnosed serologically as
having measles by the New York City Department of Health and has recovered.
The local and national public health authorities are involved.
Physicians should be aware that any susceptible contacts on the airplane or
at the airport may present with measles after an
incubation period of 10-14 days, i.e., from 27 - 31 Jan 2003.

[ProMED-mail readers are reminded that Japan and the Philippines are both
countries with continued transmission of measles virus (see ProMED-mail
postings referenced below).
In recent years, the Department of Health of the Philippines has declared
interruption of measles transmission a goal and has reduced the annual
morbidity from a high of 75 290 cases reported in 1984 (GIDEON database) to
a low of 3898 cases reported by the Philippine Department of Health in 2001.

(See ref. Measles, imported - Taiwan ex Philippines (02) below for more data
from the GIDEON database on the background of measles in the Philippines )
Given this background, travellers to both countries should make sure they
are up-to-date on measles immunizations; in the USA this applies to
individuals born after 1956. The current recommendation for revaccination of
previously vaccinated
adults is: <http://www.cdc.gov/nip/publications/pink/meas.pdf>
Readers are reminded of the presumed imported cases of measles in Mexico in
1991 with possible contact in Texas, USA. According to a report from the
Texas Department of Health (see ref. Measles, imported cases - Mexico ex USA
(02) below) the route of travel through the Dallas airport included probable
contact with a group travelling from Korea, where there was an ongoing
measles outbreak (approximately 40 000 cases). The ongoing outbreak in
Korea was also associated with measles outbreaks in Washington and Illinois
earlier that year.
Hence, the real purpose of this posting and alert is to remind readers of
the importance of up-to-date measles immunization in
general, whether travelling or not, as we really do live in a global
community. While individuals themselves may not travel far from home, they
are in contact with others that are travelling or have been travelling to
areas where measles transmission is ongoing. - Mod.MPP]
