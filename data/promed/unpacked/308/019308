A cow died and 14 are infected by an outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease (FMD) in Chapcha and Lamgong gewogs under Chukha and Paro.

On 1 Feb 2011, the outbreak occurred in a household in Gemo village
under Chukha, where 6 of its 59 cattle were infected. The last case
was recorded on 8 Feb 2011. The outbreak in Jagathang village under
Paro occurred on 10 Feb 2011, where a cow died and 8 were infected.

The source of outbreak at Jagathang is not known, as the owner said
that they never sent their cattle anywhere else; in Chapcha's case,
livestock officials said since the gewog witnessed an outbreak last
year [2010], there could have been a carrier phase.

The regional veterinary officer, Dr Basant Sharma, said the signs
have subsided and no further spread has been reported so far. "The
situation is under control," he said.

Dr Basant Sharma said, under the annual FMD vaccination programme,
about 9755 cattle were vaccinated in Paro, while 842 cattle were
vaccinated in Chukha. About 23 243 cattle were vaccinated in the
country.

Death from FMD usually occurs in calves, which are less than a year
old, and is not very common in adults, said livestock officials. FMD
reduces milk yield drastically, which affect the farmers economically.
An FMD-infected bull will breathe heavily and won't be able to plough
properly.

[According to the information available on OIE's WAHID interface, FMD
is endemic in Bhutan. The control measures in bovines, ovines and
porcines include vaccination, but figures are not given (last
available report covering the period Jan-Jun 1010). The cattle
population of Bhutan (2009 figures) is 374 784. In case the cattle
vaccination figures in the above newswire are correct (23 243), then
vaccination coverage is less than 10 percent of the national cattle
herd.

According to the Bhutan page in the website of the World Reference
Laboratory (WRL, Pirbright), the following FMDV serotypes have been
identified in Bhutan (in brackets, years of typing): when the serolast
year of identification):
FMDV-O: 1983, 1985, 1990, 1993, 1998, 2002-2004, 2007-2009
FMDV-A: 1982, 1984, 2002-2003
FMDV-C: 1991
FMDV-Asia 1: 1986, 2002

Further details, including genotyping results, up to 2009, are
available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/bhu.htm>.

Confirmation of the current suspected cases and information on the
serotype involved are requested. - Mod.AS
