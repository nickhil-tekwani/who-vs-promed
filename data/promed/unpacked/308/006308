Kindly permit our comments on: Alkhurma virus - Saudi Arabia: (MK)
20100106.0056

In the 1st place, the recent 4 cases of Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever (AHF)
were NOT detected in January 2010. All the cases were linked to last year's
Hajj and diagnosed in the post Hajj period (late November/early December
2009). The date of exposure (22 Nov 2009) to the risk factor -- the
slaughtering or processing of slaughtered sheep -- was shared by all 4
cases. These unrelated cases were all diagnosed in different private
hospitals in Jeddah. Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV) RNA was
detected at the Ministry of Health (MOH) Jeddah virology lab. Their
symptoms were successfully managed: they were discharged prior to the end
of last year [2009].

Secondly, only one of the patients resides north of Jeddah. One of the
other patients was a Taif-based butcher who slaughtered and processed sheep
in Makkah during the last Hajj season. He came to Jeddah to seek medical
attention for his illness. He could have had multiple, continuous exposures
to potentially infected animals. As such, these cases are in no way
clustered as the report suggests.

Thirdly, since an enhanced surveillance system was hitherto not in place,
it cannot be said that AHFV was absent for 15 years. Presently, the viral
hemorrhagic fever (VHF) surveillance in Jeddah is being enhanced to ensure
prompt clinical dengue virus infection: the MOH is immediately notified of
suspected dengue cases occurring in private and government health care
settings. Clinical dengue and AHF share symptoms and are considered
differential diagnoses for one another in this region. Clinically suspected
but laboratory negative dengue cases were tested for AHFV. All suspected
VHF cases are now tested simultaneously for dengue and AHFV infection.

As part of this enhanced surveillance, and 2 months prior to the last Hajj
season, blood samples of patients with clinically suspected dengue but
negative lab results (dengue IgM and IgG, dengue antigen test NS1 and PCR)
were further tested for chikungunya, Rift Valley fever, West Nile fever and
Alkhurma at the Jeddah virology lab. All tests were negative. In the past,
there have been clinically suspected dengue cases that were laboratory
negative by IgG and IgM serology as well as PCR. These cases were not
tested for AHFV infection (Ayyub, et al. 2006; Khan, et al. 2008).

The MOH, drawing on presently available scientific data, concurs that AHFV
is a tickborne virus and a genetic variant of the Kyasanur Forest disease
virus. With this in mind, it is making concerted multidisciplinary efforts
to further our understanding of AHFV epidemiology and facilitate
evidence-based prevention. If it were mosquitoborne, the time lag between
exposure and clinical onset in these 4 cases would have ensured that
mosquitoes in their neighbourhoods were infected and thereby infected
others. Additionally, all the 4 cases were adults (range: 39-56; mean: 46):
there arises the entomological quagmire as to why our local mosquitoes
preferentially bite adults in a community where children and the young are
in greater numbers. Dengue, the main differential diagnosis for AHF as well
as the predominant mosquitoborne virus in the region, is known to affect
mostly the young (Ayyub, et al. 2006; Khan, et al. 2008).

In contrast, our epidemiological investigation indicated that the 4
patients were exposed to infected animal during slaughtering or meat
processing. Efforts to trace the source of sheep slaughtered for 3 cases
have so far been unsuccessful: though the sheep market was identified, poor
documentation of animal sales and movement stalled our efforts. Not
unexpected, there was hard tick infestation of goats, sheep and camels in
the market.

In summary, the present outbreak of the AHFV is sporadic and the potential
for spread highly limited. The MOH and the Ministry of Agriculture are
fully collaborating and following developments.

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs Memish, Fagbo, Dashhash, Akbar, and Hussein for
their correction of the earlier report of 6 Jan 2010 (archive number
20100106.0056), with comments based on the MOH's thorough epidemiological
investigation of the 4 cases of Alkhurma virus infection. The results of
their concerted multidisciplinary efforts to further understanding of AHFV
epidemiology and facilitate prevention are awaited with interest.
