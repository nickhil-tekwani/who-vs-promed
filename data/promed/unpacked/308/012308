As of now 3 people have died of yellow fever [YF] in this province
[Misiones]. On admission to hospital, the YF victim presented with severe
symptoms. She had not been vaccinated against the disease [YF virus infection].

The 36 year old woman died with symptoms compatible to yellow fever [virus
infection] in the hospital in Posadas city, thus there are now 3 cases that
have occurred in the provincial capital that might be related to this
tropical disease. The woman died this past Monday [11 Jan 2009] in the
Madariaga Hospital a few hours after having arrived at this center for
medical assistance, with a severe clinical picture. At the time she was
taken to the hospital, she presented with fever accompanied by headache,
abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting with typical icteric signs, that is a
yellow color tinge of the skin. These symptoms alerted the local health
authorities, and they immediately initiated studies to establish if the
woman had contracted yellow fever [virus infection].

According to the information obtained, the dead woman resided at the
intersection of Zapiola and Tambor de Tacuari streets, she had not been
vaccinated against the disease [virus infection], but she had not traveled
[out of the city] in recent days and had not been in forested areas of this
northern province.

According to information given by her relatives when interviewed by public
health agents of the province, the patient had had health problems in
recent months, which had caused weight loss, and she also had a chronic
disease. The woman was alone in the city; her family had traveled to the
interior of the province, from which they came originally, according to
what was mentioned.

For now, there are another 2 fatal cases suspected of being due to yellow
fever -- a man and a youth who resided in the Alta Gracia neighborhood of
Posadas, but who worked as woodcutters/gatherers in the forested area in
which dead monkeys had been discovered, probably dead as a result of the
disease [yellow fever virus infection]. [These 2 cases were reported in
ProMED-mail archive no. 20081231.4119 posted on 31 Dec 2008.]

[The area involving Misiones province in the extreme north east of
Argentina and nearby areas in Rio Grande do Sul Brazil are currently a
hotspot of sylvan YF virus transmission. Although the recent cases have
clearly been a result of sylvan (jungle) transmission of the virus, this
latest case, if it is confirmed as YF, is not as clearly sylvan cycle
related. It raises the possibility that this case might have been the
result of urban transmission involving _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. Should
this case prove to be YF, one hopes that the population of Posadas City is
well vaccinated against YF virus.
