Russia: rotavirus outbreak in Yekaterinburg
-------------------------------------------
The management of the municipality-owned company in Yekaterinburg has
rejected statements by leading epidemiologists that the main cause of
epidemics in the mid-Ural region is contaminated tap water. Despite the
registration of outbreaks of rotavirus infection in the Sverdlovsk region
at the beginning of 2007, the management was not alarmed. However, it could
be that they are trying to downplay the seriousness of the situation, as
the same people have reported a 3-fold increased incidence of infection.
In Verchnaya Salda, a settlement in the Sverdlovsk region, the incidence of
rotavirus infection increased 6-fold. A survey of hospitalized patients
revealed that 60 per cent of diarrheal cases could be attributed to
rotavirus infection, and rotavirus was isolated from the local water
reservoir. In the other settlement, several children have been infected by
rotavirus, and the local manager of the Water Supply Company was charged
with failure to comply with regulations relating to the quality and supply
of drinking water.
The deputy technical director of the same company in Yekaterinburg said
that a similar situation was not possible in the capital of the Ural region
[Yekaterinburg], as the water quality is monitored daily. He also stated
that the source of infection could be bottled water of questionable quality.
Despite public concern, the chief public health physician of the Sverdlovsk
region, Andrey Yurovskikh, declared that the current situation does not
exceed the normal pattern and is not more than endemic occurrence of
disease, as current rates are comparable to seasonal highs. The chief
epidemiologist of Yekaterinburg, Ivan Kharitonov, supported the assertion
of his colleague. He says that current rates are the same as last year
[2006] and even lower by 10-15 per cent if compared with 2003-2004.
The press secretary of the Sverdlovsk Public Health Epidemiology Station,
Anna Kalinina, commenting on the rotavirus issue stated that the term
"outbreak" is more appropriate in the cases of enteric pathogens and
indicated that the closure of schools and children's institutions is out of
the control and responsibility of these institutions. She pointed out that
the reporting of this disease is encouraged but is not mandatory. Many
parents complained of the absence of vaccine, but the press secretary says
that it is costly and will not be free of charge like some other vaccines.
The specialists advise "established" preventive measures for rotavirus
infection, that is to boil the water in every case where it is destined for
a baby under 1 year old, for food, bath and wash. They comment that
children are susceptible and the infective dose is low. Some preventive
measures can be taken for protection against secondary waves of infection,
including control of the water supply network and hygiene in children's
institutions. However, statisticians claim that these measures are ineffective.

[This report provides an overview of problems relating to prevention of
rotavirus infection in Yekaterinburg and the Sverdlovsk region. It would be
encouraging if the efforts of health care workers and community services
resulted in decreased incidence, but the problem remains that in the case
of children, air droplet transmission is possible. A more effective measure
might be the reduction in contact between children's institutions and
organizations; something that has not been considered so far. - Corr.VM
