The Prime Minister of Tibetan government in exile (Sikyong) Dr. Lobsang Sangay on Mon 7 Dec 2015 expressed his concern over the rising number of hepatitis patients in the Tibetan exile community. The Harvard graduate, who swept the recent preliminary elections, was
speaking on the 1st day of the workshop on Tibetan Medicare System (TMS) at the New Reception Center in Dharamshala from 7 to 9 Dec 2015.

"In our society, the rate of hepatitis cases is 11 percent of 10 000, which is extreme. In the western world, 2 to 3 percent is considered
normal and 4 to 5 are considered alarming. But we are hovering above 9-10 percent. This shows our negligence and lack of awareness on its
preventions," Sikyong said. [This moderator left the statistics as they were, but it is totally unclear whether this represents incidence (the number of new cases in a certain time span, usually expressed in cases per 100 000 per year) or prevalence (the number of new and still-infected patients, which is usually expressed as cases per 100 000). Neither is expressed as a percentage. - Mod.LL]

Organized by the health department of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), 44 executive secretaries of hospitals and staff from 33 Tibetan settlements participated in the 3-day training workshop. CTA also have invited 4 experts to guide them on how to spread awareness and to increase enrollment.

"Many people are still confused over it. So the main objective through this workshop is to clear up any doubts regarding TMS and to increase enrollment," said Minister of Health (Kalon) Dr. Tsering Wangchuk. He also expressed similar concerns regarding the rate of hepatitis patients [please refer to moderator's note above] and assured that his department has initiated a big drive against hepatitis.

In 2015, they visited around 33 schools for hepatitis checkups and vaccinations for students from 6 to 18. We have many programs underway because hepatitis B is among the most threatening disease in our society," he said.

["Tibetan diaspora" https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_diaspora is a term used to refer to the communities of Tibetan people living outside the People's Republic of China. Tibetan emigration has had 3 separate stages. The 1st stage was in 1959 following the 14th Dalai Lama's pilgrimage to Dharamsala in India, for fear of persecution by the Red Army. The 2nd stage happened in the 1980s, when Tibet opened up to foreigners. The 3rd stage began in 1996 and continues today, with Taiwan being among the favorite destinations of Tibetan Lamas. Not all emigration from Tibet is permanent; today some parents in Tibet send their children to communities in the diaspora to receive a traditional Tibetan education. The 2009 census registered about 128 000 Tibetans in exile, with the most numerous part of the community living in India, Nepal, and Bhutan. However, in 2005 and 2009 there were estimates of up to 150 000 living in exile.

Although hepatitis B is specified in the last paragraph, it is not clear if the discussion centers on HBV or viral hepatitis in general. - Mod.LL
