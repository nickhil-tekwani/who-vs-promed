On 31 Oct 2012, the local health authorities of the neighbouring districts of A and B in Lower Saxony, northern Germany, detected an increase of hepatitis A (HA) cases. 13 serologically-confirmed HA cases had been notified within 3 days (incidence: 7.76 per 100 000 inhabitants), whereas during October to December 2011, only 1 case (incidence: 0.37 per 100 000 inhabitants) was notified in the same area.

Notification of laboratory-confirmed infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV) and notification of clinical cases of viral hepatitis are mandatory in Germany. From 2001 to 2011 in Lower Saxony, the incidence of notified HA cases declined substantially. Fitting a linear trend to the incidence rate per 100 000 population reveals an average reduction by 0.13 per year, from 2.13 in 2001 down to 0.78 in 2011. During this time, the proportion of cases that could be assigned to known outbreaks was 28 percent on annual average with a slightly increasing trend (unpublished data). In general, the true number of infections is presumed to be higher than the number of notified cases due to underreporting and the fact that many individuals, especially children, may experience HAV infection without symptoms [1].

HAV is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, either by a direct contact with a contagious person infected with HAV or by ingestion of HAV-contaminated food or water or from contaminated surfaces [2]. The average incubation period of HA is 28 days (range: 15-50 days) [3]. The period of highest infectiousness is assumed to range from 2 weeks before until 1 week after onset of jaundice. Viral shedding with highest HAV concentration in stool occurs before jaundice [4].

Food items that have been described or assumed to have caused HA outbreaks include mussels, oysters, vegetables and salad fertilized with feces [5,6], fruits including raw blueberries [7], frozen raspberries [8], frozen strawberries [9], green onions [10] and shellfish [11]. Contamination of food by infected food handlers in restaurants has also been described [12]. Several HA outbreaks have been associated with bakeries [13]. In an outbreak observed in 1968 in Michigan, United States (USA), the vehicle of infection was pastries covered with glaze or icing [14]. In an outbreak in New York, US, HA was associated with sugar-glazed baked goods [15]. An HA outbreak took place in Germany in 2004 where a bakery employee most probably contaminated the products that caused the outbreak [13].

The tenacity of HAV is higher than of other non-enveloped viruses belonging to the family of Picornaviridae. The ability of HAV to survive on hands and on inanimate surfaces plays an important role for HAV transfer from hands of infectious persons to food items and from contaminated surfaces to fingertips [16,17]. Disinfection with alcohol and hydrogen peroxide (3 percent and 6 percent concentration) has been found ineffective against HAV on surfaces [18]. According to Mbithi, unmedicated liquid soap was ineffective for reducing virus titer on hands [18], indicating that hand washing with ordinary soap is not sufficient to prevent HAV transmission. HAV is acid-stable [19] and seems to remain viable while passing through the stomach [1]. The minimum infectious dose is estimated to be very low with 10-100 virus particles. The amount of HAV shed by infected humans ranges from 106 to 108 virus particles per 1 gram of stool [20,21].

In cooperation with local and regional public health and food safety authorities, we conducted epidemiological, laboratory and molecular investigations to identify the vehicle of the outbreak to prevent further cases. The local health authorities were aware that both of the most-affected villages had a shop of a bakery company (bakery X); this bakery runs 4 shops in total. Additionally, during the standardized interviews, cases reported, without being asked, having observed signs of jaundice in a bakery X employee. Taking into consideration the literature on bakery-associated HA outbreaks [13-15], a causal link to bakery X or its products was a major hypothesis for the outbreak investigation.

Methods

Case definition
Based on the regional and temporal distribution of cases, we defined primary outbreak cases as persons:
- residing in the affected districts (A or B) or having visited the outbreak area during 15 Sep to 3 Oct 2012 and
- reported with serologically-confirmed HAV infection and
- with disease onset between 8 Oct and 12 Nov 2012.

Serologically confirmed HAV infection was defined as IgM and/or IgG positive results, depending on the time lag between apparent symptoms and taking of blood sample. If sequencing data were available and did not match the outbreak strain, the person was not regarded as case. We excluded cases with travel history to HA-endemic areas during the probable period of infection.

Secondary outbreak cases were defined as persons:
- reported with serologically-confirmed HAV infection and
- suffering from HA with onset after 12 Nov 2012 and
- having close contact with primary outbreak cases.

In the course of the outbreak investigation, 2 HAV-infected persons were detected who did not meet the primary and secondary outbreak case definition but appeared to be important to clarify the outbreak. We refer to them as early cases and they were defined as persons:
- with serologically-confirmed HAV infection (IgG and IgM) and
- with symptom onset before 8 Oct 2012 and
- residing in the outbreak area.

Cases are described in terms of time, place and demographic information.

Case-control study
In a case-control study, we investigated the hypotheses that the occurrence of disease was associated with bakery X in general, with particular food items from bakery X, or with other exposures like festivals and markets in the outbreak area during time of infection. We also considered well-known risk factors for HAV infection such as travelling abroad or consuming seafood.

We aimed to recruit primary outbreak cases according to the case definition with the following additional restrictions:
- at least 18 years of age and
- physical and mental state and language skills sufficient to allow successful participation in the interview and
- no household contact with the suspected early cases (because such persons might have had other routes of transmission than the majority of cases).

We recruited control persons by random-digit dialing, aiming for a case-control ratio of 1:1. We used an approach adapted to the German landline system [22] since landlines are still common in the outbreak region. The landline telephone numbers of residential cases were modified by incrementing the last 2 digits. This was to ensure a regional matching of controls with the cases. In addition, the controls were frequency-matched to the cases by sex and 5-year age bands. Persons were not selected as controls if they reported symptoms of HAV infection, a history of HAV infection, or an HAV vaccination (other than recent post-exposure vaccination). For the interviews, we used standardized questionnaires for cases and controls. Both cases and controls were interviewed within 2 weeks after notification of the cases by trained interviewers. The exposure data were dichotomised by classifying 'don't know' and 'no reply' into one group. The associations were estimated by univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. All exposures were investigated and assessed by odds ratios (OR) with 95 percent confident intervals (CI) and 2-tailed p-values of chi-squared test. Exposure variables with an OR over 1 and a p-value under 0.2 in univariable analysis were included in a multivariable logistic regression analysis. A stepwise backward elimination was used until all remaining variables were significant at the 0.05 level, keeping age and sex in the model. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata version 12.1.

Environmental investigation
We analysed surface swabs which were taken indoors in all 4 bakery X shops (hereafter referred to as A, B, C, D, Figure 1). HAV RNA was isolated by using a QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). Subsequently, a real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was used for detecting HAV RNA in surface specimens following the methods of Costafreda et al. [23].

Results

Descriptive epidemiology
A total of 83 outbreak cases with disease onset between 8 Oct and 29 Dec 2012 were identified (77 primary and 6 secondary outbreak cases). The median age of the primary cases was 44 years (range: 4-77 years) and 78 percent of the cases (n=61) were 18 years and older. A total of 45 percent of the cases were female (Figure 2 [For figures and tables, see original URL. - Mod.LL]).

We found that 77 cases (91 percent) were residents of the districts of A (n=52) and B (n=25) in Lower Saxony. The primary cases' places of residence (not including the visitors) were clustered mainly around 2 bakery X shops (shop A and B, see Figure 1). Seven primary cases were visitors to A or B from different German districts during the possible period of infection (15 Sep-3 Oct 2012). Three of these 7 stayed in the area for the weekend of 22-23 Sep 2012; 2 more spent a holiday from 15 to 29 Sep 2012, and 2 worked regularly in this area but lived in other districts.

Disease onset for the 1st primary outbreak case was 8 Oct 2012 (calendar week (CW) 41). The outbreak peaked in CW 43 and 44 and ended in CW 52 (Figure 3). Besides the notified cases, the outbreak investigation revealed 2 persons having experienced HAV infection with an earlier disease onset than the primary outbreak cases. Thus, we categorized them as 'early cases'. One was a bakery X employee. This person was not involved in preparing products but sold products in shop A and B and packed products for shop C and D. Henceforward, this particular employee will be referred to as 'the salesperson' (although the bakery X shops had several other salespersons), and we will use the pronoun 'they'. Onset of jaundice was early October 2012 (CW 39). The other early case was a close contact with disease onset in early September 2012 (CW 36, Figure 3). These 2 infections only became known to the health authorities in the course of the outbreak investigation. They had not previously been notified to the surveillance system. A 2nd employee of bakery X was notified as a case, but their disease onset occurred at the peak of the outbreak (CW 44).

Case-control study
Of the total 77 primary outbreak cases, we enrolled 50 cases (including 6 who were not resident in district A or B) in the case-control study together with 52 frequency-matched controls. The median age of enrolled cases was 51 years (range: 18-77 years) and of controls 52 years (range: 27-80 years). The sex distribution was almost equal. A total of 25 of the 50 cases were female, as were 30 (58 percent) of 52 controls. The univariable analysis revealed a significant association between HAV infection and being a customer of bakery X (Table 2).

A total of 41 of the 50 cases reported eating bakery X products, as did 31 of 52 controls (OR: 3.09; 95 percent CI: 1.15-8.68; p=0.013). None of the other exposures, which were unrelated to bakery X, was significantly associated with the disease. To find out more about the specific products of bakery X, we performed a nested analysis (Table 3) of cases and controls who were customers of the bakery. Sweet pastries (OR: 5.97; 95 percent CI: 1.43-34.91; p=0.005), apple cake (OR: 3.86; 95 percent CI: 0.89-23.18; p=0.043), and Bienenstich (a German cake typically made with a custard, butter cream or cream filling) (OR: 4.68; 95 percent CI:0.87-46.58; p=0.043) were significantly associated with HAV infection in univariable models. In a multivariable modeling approach adjusted for age and sex and other bakery products, only consumption of sweet pastries remained significant (ORadj: 5.74; 95 percent CI: 1.46-22.42; p=0.012). Five of 6 non-residents were among the group of bakery X customers who reported having eaten sweet pastries or cake.

Laboratory diagnostics
Six persons fulfilling the spatial and temporal requirements of the primary outbreak case definition provided specimens for additional testing. In addition, specimens were collected from both the early cases. They all tested positive for recent HAV infection (IgG and IgM positive). HAV RNA in stool specimens was detected for 1 early case, the salesperson. No HAV RNA was available for the salesperson's contact. The salesperson suffered from an underlying condition that may prolong shedding of the virus. Follow up investigations revealed that the salesperson was shedding a large amount of HAV (4.5x104 copies/ml) for about 6 months.

There were 43 other bakery staff members, of whom 14 did not provide specimens (including the HAV positive employee in CW 44). A total of 24 employees tested HAV-antibody negative. Of the remaining 5, 4 had been vaccinated or had a previous HAV infection, results showing them to be IgG positive and IgM negative; the salesperson had an acute HAV infection, as indicated above.

Environmental investigation
Surfaces in all 4 bakery X shops were examined. Overall, 129 swabs were taken from surfaces in the kitchen, bathrooms and sales spaces. HAV RNA was detected by PCR in 4 swabs from 2 bakery shops (A and B, Figure 1) at the following locations:
- cash desk and refrigerator handle (shop A)
- PC keyboard and door handle of staff toilet (shop B)

Three of the 4 surface specimens contained enough HAV RNA for molecular sequencing. Analyses of food items were not conducted because no leftover samples were available.

Molecular biology
The PCR analysis for HAV demonstrated that 7 human and 3 surface specimens contained sufficient HAV RNA to be molecularly sequenced. These 10 specimens were reanalysed using a nested PCR protocol targeting the variable VP1/P2A genomic region (Table 1). Sequence analysis of the 349 bp amplicons (PCR primer sequences not included) revealed 9 isolates (3 surface and 6 human specimens) with identical nucleotide sequences (Figure 4).

For the outbreak isolate (accession number HF677201), the closest matches in the EMBL viral sequence database (accessed April 2013) were strain TunS4-01, isolated in 2001 in Tunisia (acc. AY875664) and strain number 148, isolated in 2007 in Germany (acc. EU416238), both with 98.9 percent identity. Phylogenetic analysis allowed the 2 novel isolates to be classified as HAV genotype I, subgenotype IA (Figure 4). Genotype and subgenotype nomenclatures were applied according to a previously proposed classification scheme [26]. One of the 7 human isolates (HSCK100034 (acc. HF677202)), differs significantly from the sequence with 21 mismatches, translating into 94 percent similarity (Figure 5). Consequently, this person was not regarded as a case belonging to this outbreak. They were a sporadic visitor to the B district, had not visited the narrower outbreak region, and had not consumed products from bakery X.

Outbreak management
The local health authorities began management of the outbreak immediately after the 1st notifications. The most important measures to control the outbreak were the vaccination of all susceptible bakery X employees and cases' household contacts, and the cancellation of a fair that was to be held in the most affected village. In addition, the above-mentioned laboratory testing of bakery X staff and surface sampling in bakery X were part of the control strategy, as they facilitate the exclusion of infectious staff members from work and detect contaminated surfaces in food processing facilities.

Discussion and conclusions
-------------------------
We described a point-source HA outbreak in northern Germany with 83 laboratory-confirmed cases who developed symptoms between 8 Oct and 27 Dec 2012. This is the largest recorded autochthonous HA outbreak since the start of standardized surveillance in Germany in 2001. By means of the case-control study, we found a significant association between HAV infections and being a customer of bakery X. In particular, consuming sweet pastries was identified as a significant risk factor. This epidemiological evidence is supported by the strong laboratory evidence of the molecular identity of HAV sequences of specimens from cases, the bakery X salesperson, and surfaces inside bakery X shops. In addition, sequencing of non-residential cases confirmed their relation to the outbreak.

Onset of cases' symptoms and travel data from non-residential cases indicate that the period of infection may have lasted from 15 Sep to 3 Oct 2012, but definitely covered the weekend of 22-23 Sep 2012. In the telephone interviews, all 5 visitors with sequence-identical isolates reported having eaten sweet pastries or cake (apple cake or Bienenstich) from bakery X. Thus, epidemiological and laboratory results suggest that contaminated bakery X products were vehicles of infection. It was not possible to test bakery X products for containing HAV. There were no leftover samples from the period of infection due to the short shelf life of bakery products and the long incubation period of HA.

Considering the time of the salesperson's disease onset and their work schedule, they might have worked while being infectious and contaminated baked goods and surfaces. A potential reason for sweet pastries being the vehicle of transmission could be the fact that those often are coated with fatty substances that help the virus to persist on the surface and maybe as well help to weather the acidic milieu of the stomach. Furthermore, inactivation of HAV requires heating foods to more than 85 C [185 F] for at least one minute and sweet pastries are usually not fully baked or have unheated fillings or toppings.

Since the salesperson was suffering from a chronic disease and was treated with cortisone, the secretion of virus in their stool might have started at very high titers 1-2 weeks prior to their onset of illness, and continued for several months at lower titers after their jaundice occurred. A month after onset of jaundice, the titre was still at a high level (4.5x104 copies/ml).

It remains unclear where the infected salesperson and their close contact acquired their infections. However, we learned that the salesperson had packed and sold bakery products 1-2 weeks prior to the onset of jaundice, which correlates with the time period the visitors reported eating bakery X products. The epidemiological results may raise questions about how 9 of the cases might have been exposed as they were not costumers of bakery X. In fact, further investigation of these cases revealed that it was very likely that they all had consumed bakery X products, for example when visiting the homes of other bakery X customers. However, as we did not perform these extensive additional investigations for controls in the same way, we did not include this information into the case-control study's analysis.

The laboratory investigation showed that HAV-positive human and surface specimens had identical RNA sequences, while one case differed. Therefore, we excluded this case from the case-control study and the outbreak. This shows the importance of accomplishing outbreak investigation by sequence-based molecular methods which can verify or disprove an assumed epidemiological link. As a consequence of prompt outbreak management, the cooperation of all involved parties, and follow-up with the cases by the regional health authority, only 6 secondary cases occurred, and the outbreak was interrupted.

There were several limitations. Based on the long incubation period of HAV, a recall bias regarding the answers of consumed bakery items may have occurred. And, considering the age distribution and knowing that children have more often asymptomatic HAV infection [27], we assume that we did not identify every case.

Recommendations
-------------
Nationwide, 2 previously-reported HA outbreaks associated with baked goods were documented [13, 28]. In both, contamination of filled or glazed pastries by a baker was the probable source of HAV infection. Both of these conclusions were based on epidemiological evidence alone. In our study, we were able to sequence the HAV strains of the salesperson, primary cases and environmental specimens. It may be possible to avoid similar outbreaks in the future by addressing the potential spread of HAV through food handlers and educating food handlers as well as their employer to recognize hepatitis A symptoms and to be aware that HAV has a long incubation period.

Considering the high tenacity of HAV, we strongly recommend the supervised use of disinfectants with virucidal activity against HAV and appropriate application of virucidal disinfection in outbreak situations. For all food handlers, we recommend wearing plastic gloves while handling baked and unbaked products provided that correct handling is assured (e.g. changing gloves at the recommended intervals).

In view of the availability of an effective HAV vaccine [29] and several HA outbreaks with food handlers being the probable source, the evidence for the role of food handlers in HAV transmission and disease burden in Germany should be reviewed to inform a decision for a vaccination recommendation targeting food handlers. Future risk assessment should determine whether food handlers with chronic diseases requiring immunosuppressive treatment could be more at risk of contaminating food and might, therefore, benefit from HA immunization.

[Although the outbreak is from 2012, the source of the hepatitis A is unusual enough to post at this time. Although we often think of bakery goods as cooked, early contamination can occur following the cooking process from untreated icings or fillings. The not infrequent reports of restaurant food handlers developing acute hepatitis A and clusters like this one underscore the need for routine vaccination of food handlers for this virus. - Mod.LL
