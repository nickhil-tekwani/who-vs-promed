A study coordinated by the Ministry of Health has detected the presence of ticks infected by the virus that causes Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] in several areas of Madrid, Castilla-La Mancha, Extremadura, and Castilla y León. Despite the finding, they assert that the risk of human infection in Spain remains low.

"There is no cause for alarm; we cannot rule out any sporadic case of the disease but the risk is very low," said the General Director of Public Health of the Ministry, Elena Andradas, after the results were presented to the autonomous communities.

The research was based on an analysis of 9000 ticks obtained from wild animals and domestic livestock, following the first 2 autochthonous cases of this infectious disease detected in Spain in September 2016, one of which was deadly.

The presence has been detected in 7 of the 11 "comarcas" [subregions] studied. In total, the presence of the Crimean-Congo virus has been identified in about 300 ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_, which is equivalent to only 3 percent of all the samples analyzed, in 7 of the 11 districts studied, all near the area of Avila where the 1st human infection could have occurred last year [2016].

In addition, all infected parasites had been extracted from wild animals, especially deer, although they were also detected in cattle, wild boars and wild sheep. Around 90 percent of the ticks with the virus were probably infected by the animal from which they were extracted; another tick would previously have infected them, said Ricardo Molina, head of the Laboratory of Medical Entomology of the National Center of Microbiology and one of the authors of the study.

There is little risk of infection in humans. The Ministry of Health says that another human case like the one detected last year [2016] is unlikely, although it cannot be completely ruled out.

To avoid contagion, prevention information and recommendations have been released to the general public, especially regarding hiking or other activities in the countryside in contact with nature.

[Ticks of the genus, _Hyalomma_, particularly _Hyalomma marginatum_ are believed to be both a reservoir and a vector for the CCHF virus. The geographical distribution of CCHFV cases corresponds most closely with the distribution of members of the genus _Hyalomma_, which suggests their principal vector role. CCHFV has been isolated from numerous tick species, including 28 _Ixodes_ and 2 Argaisdae spp. Argasids do not play important roles in the geographical spread of virus because CCHFV fails to replicate in adults and nymphs of argasid tick species.

Ticks have 4 life stages: egg, larvae, nymph, and adult. Larvae hatch from the eggs, climb vegetation, and attach to passing animals; attraction to the host occurs due to heat and carbon dioxide concentrations. Some species of _Hyalomma_, _Dermacentor_, and _Rhipicephalus_ genera are capable of transstadial transmission (ie, passing the virus from larva to nymph to adult) of CCHFV after feeding on a viremic host. Transovarial transmission (ie, passage of virus to offspring) of CCHFV occurs within some of the species in these genera. Also, venereal transmission has been demonstrated among some vector species, which may contribute to maintaining the circulation of the virus in nature. Also, ticks can be infected by co-feeding with infected ticks on uninfected hosts.

The virus is transmitted to humans through tick bites or by direct contact with infected animal blood (farmers, slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians, etc). In addition, person-to-person transmission can occur due to direct or indirect contact with the skin, mucous membranes, or body fluids of infected patients. The virus may also be transmitted from human to human, primarily in the hospital setting. Climate may contribute to increased tick abundance because high temperatures, especially in the spring and summer, may accelerate the _Hyalomma_ cycle by switching on its interstadial development and host-seeking activity (https://academic.oup.com/labmed/article-lookup/doi/10.1309/LMN1P2FRZ7BKZSCO). Work by other researchers has shown the presence of the CCHF virus in up to 12.3 percent of the tested tick pools using antigen ELISA and RT rt PCR (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10493-012-9642-x).

Extremadura, a western Spanish region bordering Portugal, comprises the provinces of Cáceres and Badajoz. It's a remote area of mountains, forests, lakes and reserves, notably Monfragüe National Park and Cornalvo Natural Park, both sheltering diverse birdlife. In view of the above report, a complementary human survey of CCHF antibody prevalence could be valuable for understanding the epidemiology of the infection in the region. - Mod.UBA
