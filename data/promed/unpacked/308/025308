---------------------------------------------------
A fresh case of polio has surfaced from Duki district of Balochistan. According to sources in the provincial health department, an 18 month old boy from Killi Babran of Duki fell victim to the virus that was diagnosed in him on Friday [8 Jun 2018] morning.

Sources in the health department said [the boy] was administered the anti-polio vaccine only once during the last 6 months. He was not found present at home 5 times during the polio drive.

This is the 3rd case of polio virus from Balochistan and all over Pakistan in 2018.

Prior to [this boy], 2 other children were diagnosed with polio from the same district, Duki, in March and May [2018]. In 2017, 3 cases of polio surfaced from Balochistan, while 2 were reported in 2016.

In 2015, 7 cases of polio virus surfaced from the province, while in 2014 the count was 25. The year 2013 saw no cases of the virus from Balochistan, while 4 were reported in 2012 and 73 in 2011. This makes the total number of cases from Balochistan 117 during the last 8 years.

[As stated in the media report above, this is now the 3rd case of polio reported from Duki district, Balochistan during 2018 (see prior ProMED-mail postings referenced below in the see also section for further details]. While the virus type involved in this case is not mentioned, given the preceding 2 cases with WPV1 isolated, it is highly likely this case will be due to a WPV1 infection. Once official confirmation is received, this will represent the 3rd case of polio confirmed in Pakistan during 2018, and the 11th case this year (2018).

Duki district in Balochistan borders with Afghanistan and is known to be an area with ongoing tribal conflicts. Female literacy is reported to be less than 10 per cent, with male literacy around 30 per cent. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duki_District,_Pakistan).

More information on the poliovirus isolated would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP
