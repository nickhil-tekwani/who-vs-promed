["Contagious equine metritis (CEM) is a highly communicable venereal disease of horses, caused by the bacterium _Taylorella equigenitalis_. This disease can spread widely from a single asymptomatic carrier, particularly a stallion. Infected horses do not become systemically ill or die, but reproductive success is reduced. Additional economic impacts include the cost of pre-breeding tests and treatment in endemic areas, as well as screening before importation into CEM-free countries" (Source: Spickler, Anna Rovid. 2015, Contagious Equine Metritis, retrieved from https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/contagious_equine_metritis.pdf).
