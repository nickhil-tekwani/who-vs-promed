Shredded lettuce is taking the blame for sickening 124 people across
the USA, primarily in Western states, and 12 people in Canada, with
salmonella during the summer of 2009.

Bill Keene, senior epidemiologist for The Oregon Public Health
Division, said shredded lettuce, possibly from quick-service
restaurant locations, is the likely cause of a _Salmonella [enterica_
serotype] Typhimurium outbreak that started mid-July 2009, peaked in
August 2009, and tapered off later that month.

Keene has been involved in the epidemiological traceback for weeks,
he said, and recently saw the investigation mostly handed over to the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and state departments of
agriculture, as shredded lettuce seems to be a fairly common
denominator for affected people.

"FDA launched its involvement around the 1st of September 2009," said
Sebastian Cianci, spokesman for the FDA. "So far we have not been
able to identify a vehicle of transmission, so we don't know a
vehicle yet, but we do believe it's food related."

There were no lettuce recalls associated with this outbreak, which
makes the investigation difficult. Any contaminated product would
have been consumed by now, Keene said, so traceback cannot be
confirmed by testing. Consumer reports of food consumption are being
used as primary evidence, along with invoices and shipping and
receiving records from restaurants, distributors and shippers.

Cianci said the outlet for the unconfirmed source of contamination
seems to be fast food restaurants, although not necessarily chain
restaurants. "People reported eating at one or more fast food
restaurants, often multiple restaurants," Cianci said. "But it
doesn't seem to be one restaurant chain or one type of food served.
And it does not seem to be associated with food sold at grocery
stores."

There are still a few loose ends to tie up in epidemiological
testing, Keene said. "The epidemiological evidence can be
confirmatory, and that's what's still in progress," Keene said.
"There still is work to be done to rule out other possibilities. But
it's fair to say that most people say this is the one."

Although Keene and a portion of his colleagues are convinced,
authorities hesitate to convict shredded lettuce, partly in light of
false allegations against tomatoes during the _Salmonella_ Saintpaul
outbreak in 2008.

Cases were reported across the USA and in Canada, although most were
in the Western part of the countinent. Keene could not confirm
whether any one state or any one shipper is suspected, but he did say
at least one obvious lettuce growing state is involved.

The outbreak did not cause any fatalities, although 2 people were
hospitalized, according to media reports.

[It may well be that shredded lettuce may be statistically related to
this outbreak but without "smoking" lettuce, that is, produce
culturing the outbreak strain, the link may never be made with
confidence. - Mod.LL]
