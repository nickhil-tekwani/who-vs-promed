UNDIAGNOSED DIE-OFF, FISH - USA: (PENNSYLVANIA, IDAHO), CORRECTION
***********************************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.promedmail.org>
ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases
<http://www.isid.org>

ProMED-mail reported on a fish die-off in "Undiagnosed die-off, fish
- USA: (PA, ID) 20100716.2373," mistakenly stating it was from Idaho,
because the source report was from Idaho. The body of water in
question, Long Lake, is actually in Washington State. See
"Undiagnosed die-off, fish - USA (WA) natural causes 20100718.2408" below.

ProMED-mail regrets the error. - Mod.TG
