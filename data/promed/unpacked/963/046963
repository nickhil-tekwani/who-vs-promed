[According to the full OIE follow-up report No 10 (item 1 above), as
well as previous reports, the control measures applied include the
terms "No vaccination". It will be interesting to note which FMD
vaccine users are targeted by the Chinese enterprise mentioned, whose
"revenue from sales of vaccines for foot-and-mouth disease will
increase by a large margin," according to the analyst's forecast. A
decision not to vaccinate against FMD in China, against an FMD
serotype O strain known to be highly infectious in multiple species,
is a policy which is in need of confirmation or explanation.
