Exotic Newcastle disease (END) was confirmed on 1 Oct 2002 in California,
and has now spread beyond backyard flocks to affect 6 commercial operations
in California. On 16 Jan 2003, END was also confirmed in a backyard flock
in Nevada. Laboratory confirmation for END was received on 4 Feb 2003 for
samples that were taken from a backyard flock in Arizona.
Arizona Situation (as of 5:00 pm PST, 4 Feb 2003)
END has been confirmed in a backyard flock in La Paz County, AZ. Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is currently developing a federal
quarantine for the affected area in Arizona. APHIS and the state of Arizona
have begun surveillance efforts of the backyard bird population and have
established a Task Force in Arizona.
Number of premises positive: 1
Number of contact premises: 1
Number of premises released: 0
Number of premises depopulated: 1
Premises waiting to be depopulated: 1
Birds depopulated to date: 50
Counties with positive flocks: La Paz
All birds on the infected premises in Arizona have been depopulated.
Clinical signs in infected birds include respiratory, nervous, and
gastrointestinal signs. Mortality is up to 90 per cent of exposed birds.
Investigations are ongoing and all figures are pending final validation.
Veterinary Services is working rapidly to expand staff on the task force in
the states of California and Nevada and is exploring all options to send
APHIS personnel, other federal government personnel, and is working with
the states to consider additional resources to meet the labor demands.
APHIS is continuing to develop a plan for national END surveillance. This
plan will enhance the already extensive surveillance underway in California
and Nevada.
Nevada Situation (as of 5:00 pm PST, 3 Feb 2003)
END has been confirmed in a backyard flock in Las Vegas, NV. Federal and
State quarantines have been established for all of Clark County and a
portion of Nye County, NV. The US Department of Agriculture has also
declared an extraordinary emergency. APHIS and the state of Nevada have
begun surveillance efforts of the backyard bird population and have
established a task force in Nevada.
Number of premises positive: 7 (no change from 4 Feb report)
Number of contact premises: 90 (up 1 from 4 Feb report)
Number of premises released: 0 (no change from 4 Feb report)
Number of premises depopulated: 96
Premises waiting to be depopulated: 1
Birds depopulated to date: 1670
Counties with positive flocks: Clark
California Situation (as of 5:00 pm PST, 3 Feb 2003)
Officials with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and
APHIS continue to work closely on efforts to control the END outbreak in
southern California. USDA has instituted a federal quarantine zone that
serves as a buffer around the END-affected area in Southern California. The
department has also declared an extraordinary emergency to provide
additional resources and authorities to the eradication campaign for END in
Southern California.
Number of premises positive: 492 (up 9 from 4 Feb report)
Number of contact premises: 1046 (up 8 from 4 Feb report)
Number of premises released: 28 (no change from 3 Feb report)
Number of premises depopulated: 1382
Premises waiting to be depopulated: 167
Birds depopulated to date: 1 889 101
Counties with positive flocks: Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San
Bernardino, San Diego, Ventura
Operational Update
Of the 96 premises in Nevada designated for depopulation, 92.7 per cent
have been completed.
Of the 1549 premises in California designated for depopulation, 89.2 per
cent have been completed.
Samples taken from backyard birds from the state of Arizona came back
positive for END. The sequencing identical to the END virus being found in
California and Nevada. The infected premises in Arizona has already been
depopulated. A short incident command team has been dispatched and is
working on surveillance in Arizona to assess the situation in Arizona.
Effective 7 Jan 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that regulates the
interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry products from
Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa
Barbara, and Ventura Counties, CA.
Effective 17 Jan 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that regulates
the interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry products from
Clark and a portion of Nye County, NV.
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has declared an extraordinary
emergency for the States of California and Nevada. These declarations allow
USDA to apply federal authority within California and Nevada. Additional
commercial premises are currently under investigation. Samples have been
submitted for diagnostic testing. Virus isolation is pending. Task force
personnel are conducting a door-to-door campaign to identify affected
premises. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing.
Entities that sell birds continue to be monitored in affected areas. If a
flock tests positive, officials will quarantine the premises immediately
and order the destruction of the flock as soon as it is logistically possible.
Veterinary officials from Mexico are observing Task Force surveillance,
depopulation, and cleaning and disinfection operations in California and
Nevada through the end of this week.

Arizona finds bird virus, sets quarantine
-----------------------------------------
The governor declared a state of emergency on Tuesday after a deadly bird
virus was found in chickens at an Indian reservation in western Arizona.
The state Department of Agriculture was expected on Wednesday to quarantine
Yuma County, La Paz County and part of Mohave County south of the Grand
Canyon, said Lori Faeth, natural resources adviser to governor Janet
Napolitano. "It's highly contagious," she said.
A USDA lab announced that the birds had contracted exotic Newcastle
disease, which has led to the slaughter of 1.7 million chickens in southern
California and about 1600 birds in Nevada. The disease was discovered in
Arizona after a farmer on the Colorado River Indian Tribes' reservation
near the California border reported last week that about 30 chickens had
died suddenly.
The rest of the flock, about 20 birds, was immediately euthanized and the
tribal government quarantined all domestic birds on the reservation.The
disease is highly contagious among poultry and birds but poses no health
risks for humans. Declaring a state of emergency makes Arizona eligible to
receive federal aid. Meanwhile, officials in Nevada eased restrictions
imposed in the southern part of the state [in January 2003] after the
discovery of the disease in some backyard chickens.
David Thain, Nevada's chief veterinarian, said the disease had been mostly
stamped out in Clark and Nye counties and it was safe for businesses to
sell all birds except poultry. A quarantine remains in effect in those
counties, meaning birds can't be transported outside the area and to
neighboring states without a permit, officials said. "We are not willing to
go out on a limb and say it is eliminated," Thain said. "But we haven't
found any spread to the pet-bird population."
Since the disease turned up in backyard poultry flocks in Southern
California in September 2002, authorities are conducting an intensive
eradication campaign and have imposed a quarantine throughout that region
to try to protect the state's $3 billion poultry industry. Nevada does not
have a commercial poultry industry. Exotic Newcastle is caused by a virus
found in the droppings, breath, and eggs of birds. An infected bird can
pass the disease to another bird by being in close proximity.
