Two Minnesota infants have fallen ill with salmonellosis after eating a brand of tahini sesame paste that is the subject of a multistate recall, state officials said Fri 17 May 2013.

Consumers are being directed to not eat Krinos brand tahini from the affected batches. The product was recalled on 28 Apr 2013 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after the Michigan Department of Agriculture found salmonellae in routine sampling. Further testing by the FDA found salmonella in other samples from the same brand, and the strains matched the DNA fingerprint of salmonella associated with a small multistate cluster of cases.

Neither of the Minnesota children was hospitalized, and both are recovering.

Samples of tahini from the homes of the affected Minnesota children have been collected and are being analyzed by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture. The Minnesota Department of Health has confirmed that the infections in the Minnesota cases match the 2 strains identified by the FDA.

State officials said the product should be thrown out and the lid from the product returned to Krinos for a refund. The Krinos brand tahini sesame paste was distributed nationwide through retail stores. It is sold in 1- and 2-pound jars, and in 40-pound pails. The recalled lots have a code stamped on the lid of EXP JAN 01 -- 2014 up to and including EXP JUN 08 -- 2014 and EXP OCT 16 -- 2014 up to and including EXP MAR 15 -- 2015.

Salmonellosis has been on the upswing in the USA in recent years, with at least 6 multistate food-borne outbreaks reported by the FDA in 2013. The nation records about 42 000 cases of the illness each year.
