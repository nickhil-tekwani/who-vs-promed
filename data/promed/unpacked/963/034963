5th area case of measles is reported
------------------------------------
Health officials said yesterday (Mon 20 Apr 2009) that a DC [District of
Columbia] man has measles, and the authorities are retracing his steps
earlier this month [April 2009] in the District [of Columbia] and
Montgomery [Maryland] and Arlington [Virginia] counties to determine
whether anyone might have been exposed to the highly infectious disease. It
is the 5th case of measles in the region this year [2009], but is not
related to the others. The rare outbreak has prompted health officials in
the District, Virginia, and Maryland to focus on small pockets of
unimmunized individuals, mainly babies who have not yet been vaccinated and
people born outside the United States.

The man from DC contracted the virus during a 3-week trip to India but did
not show symptoms until after he returned home, said DC Health Department
director Pierre Vigilance. Doctors believe the man's wife also has measles
and are awaiting test results. Vigilance said the man had never been
immunized but wouldn't comment on his citizenship or why he had not been
vaccinated. The reasons don't matter to us, Vigilance said. We just want to
contain this.

By the time the man realized he had measles and sought medical attention,
he had already visited 7 places throughout the Washington region.
Authorities urged any unimmunized people who visited those locations during
the time the man visited to contact health officials.

The virus usually causes a red skin rash, high fever, and watery eyes,
symptoms that last for about a week. The 1st symptoms can appear as long as
21 days after exposure. Although most people recover within a week, measles
can lead to pneumonia and, in rare cases, can be fatal. Those who suspect
that they might have measles are encouraged to call ahead before going to
doctors' offices or hospitals to avoid spreading the virus.

Measles cases are uncommon in the United States because vaccinations are
required of most schoolchildren and foreign-born individuals who become US
citizens. Outbreaks often begin when an unimmunized person visits a country
where the disease is still prevalent and then returns with the infection.
The virus is usually spread through sneezing and coughing and can remain in
the air or on surfaces for 2 hours.

The other measles cases were in Montgomery County [Maryland]. In February
[2009], a man contracted measles while traveling abroad and then infected a
co-worker. That employee visited Shady Grove Adventist Hospital in March
[2009], where he infected an 8 month old baby. A 4th man learned he had
measles earlier this month [April 2009], but his case is not related to the
others. Officials have notified people with whom he might have come into
contact at Shady Grove's emergency room on the evenings of 5 and 6 Apr
2009, and at the hospital's short-stay unit during most of 7 Apr 2009. They
also contacted members of the man's church.

So far, no additional cases have surfaced, but signs of infection could
appear as late as 29 Apr 2009, said Ulder Tillman, Montgomery health officer.
