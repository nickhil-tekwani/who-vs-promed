It is probably safe to assume that the immigrant working population
received screening tests for hepatitis B with serum HBsAg, for venereal
disease with serum VDRL and for tuberculosis with a PPD skin test. A
positive result on any of these tests however is not equivalent to
HAVING the disease. For instance one could "simply" be a chronic
hepatitis B carrier which is highly prevalent in the developed world.
The VDRL is non-specific ,especially in the developed world, and
false-positives occur or it can remain positive in a low titer even
after succesful treatment for syphilis. The PPD skin test is also
non-specific or it signifies only past exposure to _Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_.

[All very true, but a carrier is still a carrier and a menace to
others. Granted that the other tests are somewhat non-specific, can
anyone suggest a more cost-effective way of screening would-be
immigrants? Chest xrays are expensive - Mod.JW
