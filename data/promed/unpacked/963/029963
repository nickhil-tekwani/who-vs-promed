The health minister, Jose Van-Dunem, reported on Wednesday [20 Jan 2016] in Luanda [province] that 23 cases of yellow fever were recorded that resulted in 7 deaths of Eritrean and Congolese citizens in Zango I ward in Viana municipality.

According to the official, who was speaking at a press conference, of the 16 survivors, 13 were discharged and 3 are given special care. Among the victims, 22 are men and one is a woman, aged between 20 and 46 years old.

He said that the 1st case of yellow fever was recorded on 5 Dec 2015 by a citizen of Eritrea.

To detect hemorrhagic fever that affects the citizens of Viana, Jose Van-Dunem recalled that the Ministry of Health had sent 3 samples in South Africa and found that it was yellow fever, but still he stressed, it is awaited the final result of the tests sent to the laboratory of Dakar, Senegal, by the World Health Organization (WHO).

He assured that after the final result, the Ministry of Health will hold vaccination campaign in Viana, targeting firstly children, pregnant women, health professionals and finally the population in general.

The official explained that yellow fever is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes fever, muscle aches, loss of appetite, nausea and may lead to death.

This disease can expand nationally, so measures must be taken to prevent and combat this disease so as to avoid its expansion nationwide.

[This report provides little epidemiological detail about the 23 yellow fever (YF) cases in the Viana municipality of Luanda province. ProMED-mail would be interested to know, if these are cases are confirmed as YF, whether they involve the urban cycle of transmission. If so, there is a significant risk of further, rapid ongoing transmission if the population in this area has not been vaccinated previously. ProMED-mail would also be interested in the specific location and dates where and when the YF virus infections occurred, as well as information about the sex and ages of the victims. Is the YF vaccination campaign planned in the areas where the cases occurred or over a larger area?

There was a suspected YF outbreak in Uige province in 2006. ProMED-mail was unable to learn if this outbreak was subsequently laboratory confirmed. - Mod.TY

Because YF vaccine needs 10 days to take effect, vaccination should be carried out in the area while waiting for confirmation from Dakar. - Mod.JW
