The Ministry of Public Health and Population of Yemen reported 16 308 suspected cases and 14 associated deaths during epidemiological week 32 (5-11 Aug) of 2019. 12 percent of cases were severe. The cumulative total number of suspected cholera cases from 1 Jan 2018 to 11 Aug 2019 is 936 822, with 1313 associated deaths (CFR 0.14%). Children under 5 represent 24.5 % of total suspected cases during 2019.

The outbreak has affected 22 of 23 governorates and 305 of 333 districts in Yemen. From week 8 in 2019, the trend of weekly reported suspected cholera cases started increasing and reached to more than 29 500 cases in week 14. These were the maximum number of cases reported so far. The trend of suspected cases has been fluctuating over the past weeks. Starting from week 23, the number of cases increased with the start of the rainy season. However, since week 27, fewer cases were reported every week.

The governorates reporting the highest number of suspected cases of cholera during 2019 were Amanat Al Asimah (81 947), Al Hudaydah (27 128), Sanaa (69 526), Hajjah (53 794), Dhamar (48 745), Ibb (50 950), Lahj (5013) and Arman (38 077). Out of a total of 86 819 samples tested since January 2019, 4279 have been confirmed as cholera-positive by culture at the central public health laboratories. During this reporting period, the governorates reported that highest number of positive cultures were 1104 from Taizz; 1148 from Amanat Al Asimah, and 433 were positive from Sanaa.

WHO continues to provide leadership and support for activities with health authorities and partners to respond to this ongoing cholera outbreak, including case management, surveillance and laboratory investigations, hotspot mapping and OCV campaign planning, water sanitation, hygiene (WaSH) and risk communication.

[The calculated case fatality rate from this is quite low, strongly suggesting that many of the cases are not cholera. Even with that, the numbers reported in this continuing catastrophe are difficult to wrap one's head around. - Mod.LL
