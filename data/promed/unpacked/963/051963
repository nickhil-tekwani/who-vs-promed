My apology for the typographical error. H3N8 is the viral agent
responsible for [the equine influenza mutation] CIV I referred to in
my comments, not H3N5 as I unintentionally wrote.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Lelli and our sharp-eyed readers
for pointing out the typographical error which I perpetuated
unintentionally. Canine influenza virus is caused by H3N8 not H3N5. I
regret the error. - Mod.TG]
