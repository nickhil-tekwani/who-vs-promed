Honduras: Over 200 Cases of Dengue Fever so far This Year
---------------------------------------------------------
At least 9 new cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever and 195 cases of
classic dengue fever have been registered so far this year in
Honduras, health officials said. Nine of the 36 suspected cases of
dengue hemorrhagic fever have been confirmed so far, but no deaths
have been reported, Health Ministry Environmental Health Office chief
Mirna de Lobo said.
"We're still operating within the safety zone" in controlling the
disease, which reached epidemic proportions in Honduras last year.
Schools are being fumigated to destroy the breeding grounds of the
mosquito that transmits dengue fever before the school year gets
under way next week, the official said.
In addition, vehicles are being fumigated at border crossing stations
to keep the virus from entering the Central American country. Some 32
000 cases of classic dengue and 877 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever
were reported in Honduras in 2002, resulting in 16 deaths.
Honduras received aid from Cuba, Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and
other countries and international organizations to fight the
epidemic, the most virulent in recent history.
