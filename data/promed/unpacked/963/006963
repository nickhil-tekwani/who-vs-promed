RABBIT CALICIVIRUS DISTRIBUTION (2)
===================================
This is in response to a distribution list in Promed Digest, V96,
Number 007, which indicated that the United States has a low
sporadic occurrence of rabbit calicivirus (RC). There is no
scientific evidence to support the presence of RC in the United
States.
There have been no recent or historic reports of death losses or
clinical signs compatible with RC. In addition, the Foreign Animal
Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL) at Plum Island, NY, has never
confirmed a domestic case or RC. Finally, surveillance by several
hundred state, federal and university Foreign Animal Disease
Diagnosticians (FADD's) placed in the field and diagnostic
laboratories throughout the United States has revealed no positive
cases. The FADDL has been training FADD's in the clinical signs and
post mortem lesions of RC since 1989.
Information on domestic animal and poultry disease occurrences,
surveillance, and monitoring programs, or import-export regulations
