According to details, a Congo [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever; CCHF] victim was a resident of Murree, Pakistan, and he was under treatment in the Holy Family Hospital, Rawalpindi for 3 months, but today [19 Oct 2015], he lost the fight of his life.

Since the start of year 2015, the total number of causalities [in Rawalpindi?] due to Congo virus has reached 3.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread tick-borne viral disease that is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia.

[This must be the 3rd case in Rawalpindi or the entire Punjab province this year (2015), since there are many more cases in other provinces. It seems a bit odd that the patient died 3 months after admission at the time when acutely infected. The clinical details of this case are not provided.

The circumstances under which the patient acquired his CCHF virus infection are not stated. It could have been via tick bite or via exposure to the blood of an infected animal. From the above report, it seems unlikely that he was infected from close contact with an infected individual, as most of these cases of transmission occur in health care facilities. Implementation of the WHO protocol in treatment of these patients is prudent to avoid nosocomial infections.

The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur, which is why there is concern for the health care workers who are in contact with patients.

The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.
