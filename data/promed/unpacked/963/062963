Poultry farmers complain of impact of unconfirmed bird flu reports
------------------------------------------------------------------
Japan's decision to halt poultry imports from Taiwan following a news
report about a suspected bird flu outbreak on the island has sparked
widespread discontent among Taiwan's poultry farmers, who demanded
Thursday [18 Dec 2008] that the government swiftly resolve the
problem. Poultry farmers, particularly those in southern Taiwan,
complained that their livelihood will be impacted and lashed out at
what they called irresponsible media reports.

The problem was sparked Wednesday when the Liberty Times reported
that a large number of chickens at a poultry farm in Tainan County
were confirmed by a government laboratory to have died from the H5N2
bird flu virus last month [November 2008]. The report alleged that
the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) sought to cover up the
matter so as not to mar the launch of direct air, shipping and postal
links between Taiwan and mainland China on Monday.

The COA denied the report. Huang Kuo-ching, deputy director of the
COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine,
said Wednesday [17 Dec 2008] that there is no H5N2 avian flu outbreak
in Taiwan, except for an incident in late October at a poultry farm
in Luchu township, Kaohsiung County.

As the fatality rate among chickens at the farm was below 3 percent,
which is far lower than the average mortality rate in cases of the
low-pathogenic H5N2 virus, the COA was hesitant to categorize it as
an epidemic, Huang explained, adding that the council did not try to
cover up any bird flu outbreak. All the remaining 18 000 chickens at
the farm were culled in an effort to prevent a spread, Huang said,
adding that the situation was under control and that nothing unusual
has been detected so far.

Despite the COA's explanation, Japan announced later Wednesday that
it was immediately halting poultry meat imports from Taiwan on a
temporary basis to prevent the H5N2 bird flu virus from entering its territory.

Tang Jung-sheng, chairman of the Kaohsiung County chicken-raising
association, said Thursday [18 Dec 2008] that such unconfirmed
reports will hurt the domestic industry, particularly at the current
time of economic recession when consumers are paring back spending
and buying less chicken. Representatives of industry associations
across the country will call a meeting Thursday in central Taiwan's
Changhua County to discuss countermeasures in the face of the latest
development, said Tang.

An executive at the Taiwan's largest frozen poultry meat exporting
company said the Liberty Times report has dealt a heavy blow to
Taiwan's frozen duck meat exports to Japan. One of his company's duck
meat containers shipped to Japan has been destroyed there, he said.
Taiwan's frozen chicken meat exports are uncompetitive in the
international market, but the company's duck meat exports are popular
in Japan and are sold in the quality-conscious Japanese market at a
similar price level as U.S. beef, he said.

Duck farmers urged the COA to quickly provide a clear explanation to
Japan to help farmers reduce possible losses. Chen Chien-chu, a duck
raiser in Fongyuan township in Changhua County in central Taiwan said
he felt very distressed after learning of the news, since most of his
ducks are exported to Japan at a very stable price.

"Poultry farmers suffer a lot of monetary losses every time there are
such news report," Chen complained. "I lost some NTD 2 million (USD
60 000) in just one month last time when there was a similar false
report," he said.

The value of Taiwan's poultry meat exports to Japan totals around USD
23 million per year, with frozen duck meat as the bulk. In 2007,
Japan imported 5128 tons of poultry meat and 148 tons of chicken eggs
from Taiwan, Japanese government statistics showed.

The COA is still trying to track the cause of the deaths among the
dead chickens, and will publish the findings upon completion of
tests, the COA's Huang said. Meanwhile, the impact of the Japan's
newest measure is relatively small in the rest of the country where
the poultry industry is not prominent.

[There are additional, conflicting newswires on the above mentioned
suspected H5N2 outbreak in Taiwan, questioning the fire behind the
smoke. A 1st-hand, official information on the actual situation, from
the competent authority -- namely the Bureau of Animal and Plant
Inspection Quarantine, Council of agriculture, Executive Yuang,
Taipei, Taiwan -- is urgently needed. We shall be glad to post such
information as soon as it becomes available. -Mod.AS]

[2] Hong Kong update

Dead chickens get H5N1 mutation all-clear
-----------------------------------------
The H5N1 virus found in dead chickens in a Yuen Long farm had not
mutated, Undersecretary for Food and Health Gabriel Leung told the
Legislative Council's panel on food safety and environmental hygiene
yesterday [Thu 18 Dec 2008]. The genetic sequencing of the bird flu
virus detected in the farm on 9 Dec 2008 did not contain obvious
differences from previous viruses, Leung told the panel. Leung also
said more tests were needed to find out how the chickens contracted the virus.

There was also good news for the public: Live chickens can be sold
again as early as 30 Dec 2008 if things go smoothly. The early end to
the normal 21-day no-chicken ban means the birds will once again be
on the menu for Lunar New Year family festivities.

Meanwhile, an Agriculture Fisheries and Conservation Department
spokeswoman yesterday [18 Dec 2008] explained why the government has
been using an H5N2 vaccine manufactured in the Netherlands to protect
local chickens from the flu since 2003, even though recent outbreaks
showed the virus strain to be subtype H5N1. She said when vaccines
were 1st introduced to local chicken farms, tests had shown the H5N2
vaccine to be effective against the viruses found in South China.

"The H5N2 vaccine is also effective against H5N1 viruses," the
spokeswoman said, adding that in 2006, the government had let US
authorities test the vaccine, which also showed it is effective for
use in southern China. "However, no vaccine is 100 percent effective.
The government has set up an investigation group on avian influenza
to look into the matter," she said.

[The use of an H5N2 vaccine in Hong Kong for the control of H5N1 was
discussed in ProMED-mail's postings several times, initially in
January 2004. Posting 20040129.0339 included the following statements:

1. The use of H5N2 as a vaccine to protect against H5N1 is designed
to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals.
2. The application of avian influenza vaccines with a heterologous
neuraminidase (not N1, in the current case) is meant to enable their
use as natural "marker" vaccines or DIVA (acronym for differentiating
infected from vaccinated animals). This method has been advocated and
applied in recent years in several countries, initially Northern Italy.

Further background on the various HPAI vaccine types currently
available is to be found in the review postings 20050307.0680 and
20050308.0689. See also Ref 1 and chapter 2 . 3 . 4 . "Avian
