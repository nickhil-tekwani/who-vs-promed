Doctors on the scene are seeing some cases of diarrhea and skin infections.
Mayor Ray Nagin of New Orleans appeared today on CNN saying that mosquitoes
are breeding there and will be feeding on dead bodies and spreading disease.
He is wrong; mosquitoes are not attracted to dead bodies, since they feed on
blood.

<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/disasters/hurricanes/infectiousdisease.asp>

Includes:
- Decaying bodies create very little risk for major disease outbreaks.
- Outbreaks of infectious diseases following hurricanes are rare in developed
countries (such as the USA).
- Because cholera and typhoid are not commonly found in the U.S. Gulf States
area, it is very unlikely that they would occur after Hurricane Katrina.
