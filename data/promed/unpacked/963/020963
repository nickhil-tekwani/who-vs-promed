[1] EC-supplied vaccine, Algeria & Tunisia
Date: Mon 4 Aug 2014
From: Keith Sumption <Keith.Sumption@fao.org> [edited]

[ProMED-mail's post 20140802.2654821 of 2 Aug 2014 included a request for information "on the vaccine strain included in the vaccines to be soon supplied by the European Commission to Tunisia and Algeria." We are grateful for the following immediate, firsthand response. - Mod.AS]


The vaccine (to be formulated by Merial) will be trivalent (O/A Iran-05/SAT-2 Eritrea), with minimum potency 6.

The strains have been chosen following vaccine matching results on the circulating O India 2001 topotype, on recent type A strains in Libya/West Eurasia, and relevant SAT2 isolates received by Pirbright in 2013-14.

[This is good news, particularly since the incorporated FMDV-O strain has, reportedly, been included following vaccine matching results on the circulating "O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage" strain. The need for vaccine matching tests has been raised in the 2 recent EUFMD quarterly reports (see 20140802.2654821).

FMDV "O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage" strain is known to have spread in recent years from the Indian sub-continent into West Eurasia and North Africa (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria). The availability of an efficient vaccine against this invasive FMD virus strain is of particular importance globally. - Mod.AS]

The National Union of Algerian Farmers warned of the dangerous spread of foot and mouth disease [FMD], which has infected cattle and livestock. FMD will have an impact on livestock prices, with a remarkable rise ahead of Eid al-Adha in the coming 2 months if the virus spread is not controlled.

Taher Djaref, a member of the National Union of Algerian Farmers, asserted in phone interview with Echorouk that FMD, which has spread recently in many eastern and central cities of Algeria, would affect the prices of sacrificed animals with the approach of Eid al-Adha due to the large loss of sheep and cows because of the spread of the disease, and the deaths of a huge number of cattle and livestock.

"Red meat prices will notice a remarkable rise because of FMD. Government will be forced to import additional quantities of meat from abroad to compensate for the large shortage caused by the disease and to ensure adequate sheep for citizens in Eid al-Adha."

"The Farmers Union rushed to launch an extensive awareness campaign and coordinate with the Ministry of Agriculture for the benefit of cattle ranchers following the announcement of the discovery of the disease in the eastern and central cities of Algeria, and this is to raise awareness about the dangers of FMD and [instruct] them on how to deal with the disease by isolating the infected cattle from the rest of healthy cattle."

"It is better not to allow [contact] between the cattle in the markets and take all the necessary precautions, especially [to vaccinate them]. The Ministry of Agriculture has stepped up its efforts to curb the spread of the disease to the rest of the states. Algeria's veterinary services announced an emergency since the early hours of the disease's discovery in the area of Bir Laarche in Setif (eastern Algeria), where cows' dead bodies were discovered. After the preview, authorities cordoned off the area and closed livestock markets."

"Livestock owners should report on the cases if they see symptoms of the disease in their cows or sheep and call the veterinary services, and then separate the infected cattle from the rest of the cattle so as not to infect more animals. Government will compensate all the peasants who face a loss by 100 percent for every cow infected with FMD, as the Agriculture Ministry will grant 80 percent of the real market price and 20 percent for each cow that is slaughtered and sold as red meat."

[3] Algeria, spread, potential regional impact

FMD appears to be spreading at high speed in cattle. After the provinces of the eastern and central parts of the country, namely Setif, Bouira, Constantine, Bejaia, Tizi Ouzou and Medea, 2 new outbreaks were detected yesterday [1 Aug 2014] in [the province] Algiers, according to the Department of Veterinary Services of the Ministry of Agriculture [According to earlier media-derived information, Algiers is the 9th province affected. - Mod.AS].

Boughanem Karim, Director of Veterinary Services, told us that "21 cattle were slaughtered to prevent the spread of disease." A total of 149 animals with FMDV were culled in the affected areas since the inception of the epidemic: 75 of them in slaughterhouses and 74 on farm premises. Mr. Boughanem has reminded the population of the country that the disease has no impact on public health and that the meat of the slaughtered animal is proper for consumption. However, slaughter of affected animals can only be ordered by a decision of the veterinary services.

There will be no impact on the price of meat as long as supply and demand do not change. The only losses would be those that may occur should the disease not be confined. "If the virus spreads more significantly, it will be difficult to rebuild slaughtered herds, and the economic damage will be enormous." For now, we are not there.

Mr. Boughanem said they are not likely to see the damage recorded in 1999, when the disease reached Algerian cattle and spread very quickly, reaching Morocco (and Tunisia. - Mod.AS) in 4 days. "Vaccination efforts undertaken around contaminated holdings will contain the disease and prevent it from reaching the western part of the country," he added.

The Ministry of Agriculture has decided to allocate a budget of 100 million dinars [USD 1.34 million] for the purchase of 900 000 doses of vaccine from 2 European laboratories. As livestock owners fear financial losses, Mr. Boughanem said the compensation procedures were initiated, and up to 80 percent of the value of the animal will be reimbursed.

Cases of FMD have been reported by some cattle farmers in the wilaya of Tizi Ouzou. For this reason, the weekly cattle market of the province did not opened its doors yesterday [Fri 1 Aug 2014], we learned from a breeder from Timizart n'Sidi Mansour.

When asked about measures taken for the prevention of the disease, the president of the Association of cattle and milk collectors of the province, Hocine Mohand, told us that "there is nothing official about the disease in the region; however, as breeders and milk collectors, we are enforcing some preventive measures even though FMD is indeed already here.

Hocine Mohand declared that these measures consist of avoiding the purchase of cattle from outside the province and mixing them with our cattle; these measures were adopted when they heard of the presence of the disease in neighbouring provinces. He added: "Our livestock have been vaccinated after the warning, i.e. since last May 2014 when the disease made an incursion into Algeria from Tunisia."

Athman Lamrache, a milk collector of Ath Jennad region, told us that "drastic precautions in any breeder or milk collector are observed in this region, namely the enforcement of quarantine of suspected herds and vaccination of cattle. Thus, we avoid attending livestock markets, although our herds are regularly vaccinated and monitored by veterinarians, and we will maintain this attitude until the scourge disappears."

For milk production [decline?], Mr. Lamrache says he has "found no drop, except [for the] natural decrease of milk yield observed in this season (August-September)."

Note that a case of FMD was reported in the village of Ait Ouchene, in the municipality of Aghribs (Azeffoun), we learned from a veterinarian in the area. The affected farm has been quarantined pending follow-up by veterinary services. In 1999, it must be remembered that beef cattle in the province of Tizi Ouzou became infected with FMD following illegal purchase of animals from local cattle breeders in souk Boufarik (Blida).

[The spread of the virus in Algeria is of particular concern to its western neighbour, Morocco, where vaccination against FMD has been discontinued since 2007. In fact, Morocco, with considerable animal populations (2013 data) of nearly 3.2 million cattle, 6.3 million goats and 20 million sheep, has been striving to achieve a status of a country "free of FMD without vaccination." On the other hand, the 2 other Maghreb countries, Tunisia and Algeria, have been striving to obtain the status of countries "free of FMD with vaccination." All 3 tried to achieve their respective goals by endorsing OIE's "official FMD control programme," described further.

On 27 May 2014, during OIE's recent General Session, the World Assembly adopted resolution No. 16, resolving as follows:
"The Director General publishes the following List of Member Countries with endorsed official control programmes for FMD, according to the provisions of Chapter [8.7] of the Terrestrial Code: Algeria, Bolivia, Ecuador, Morocco and Tunisia" (see posting 20140618.2548794). The recognition was meant to facilitate those countries a roadmap to obtain an FMD-free status (with or without vaccination). Resolution No. 16 can be read at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/2014_A_RESO-16_FMDControlProg.pdf.

The overall objective of an OIE endorsed "official control programme for FMD" is for Member Countries to progressively improve the situation and eventually attain free status for FMD. The conditions required from countries applying for endorsement of their official control programme for FMD are spelled out in article 8.7.48. of OIE's Terrestrial code, available on pages 18-19 of the document at
http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahc/2010/chapitre_fmd.pdf.

In contrast to Morocco, where FMD vaccination has been banned for several years, Tunisia and Algeria have opted for vaccination policy. Their 2013 vaccination statistics, as reported to the OIE, were the following:

Tunisia:
cattle: 413 651 vaccinated out of a population of 646 157 (coverage, 64 percent).
Sheep & goats: 3 731 517 vaccinated out of a population of 8 129 980 (coverage, 46 percent).

Algeria:
cattle: 861 836 vaccinated out of a population of 1 909 455 (coverage, 45 percent).
Sheep and goats: No vaccination performed.

The disease has spread, since April 2014, in Tunisia in spite of the earlier, preventive vaccination. This may be attributed to the vaccination coverage being partial and possibly also to the field strain (O/ME-SA/Ind-2001) being different from the vaccine strain applied. However, the morbidity rate (and mortality) recorded in the affected flocks in Tunisia seemed to be kept low, probably thanks to the (partial) protection conferred by vaccination.

The prospects of the disease in Algeria seem to be less encouraging, in view of the lower coverage in cattle and the total absence of vaccination in small ruminants. Information on the efficacy of the vaccine applied (reportedly, "DECIVAC FMD DOE bivalent, seortypes O1 & A17/77, produced by Intervet India) is requested.

FMD signs in sheep are generally mild and sometimes subclinical, but these animals do get readily infected, and they certainly are effective disseminators of the virus. This should be a cause for concern in Algeria, and even more so in neighbouring Morocco, with the entire ruminant population being susceptible and sheep flocks known to cross the borders.

According to article 8.7.48 of the Terrestrial Code, the OIE may withdraw the endorsement of the official FMD control programme from a country if there is evidence of:

- non-compliance with the timelines or performance indicators of the programme; or
- significant problems with the performance of the applicant's Veterinary Services; or
- an increase in the incidence of FMD that cannot be addressed by the programme.

Hopefully, sufficient quantities of potent vaccines (see item 1 above) will become soon available and quickly applied in the cattle and small ruminant populations in Tunisia and Algeria. In the latter, the primary vaccination of the fully susceptible sheep and goats may require booster vaccinations if effective protection is to be acquired.

It will be interesting to follow Morocco's policy in the near future; general vaccination might become an issue for consideration. - Mod.AS
