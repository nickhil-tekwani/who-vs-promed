[The following commentary on RVF in animals includes the most recent (today's) available information. - Mod.AS]

The Mauritanian Ministry of Livestock announced Tuesday evening [27 Sep 2022], that the number of confirmed cases of Rift Valley fever in livestock has reached 231 cases in 7 wilayat (regions).

Assaba becomes the 7th wilaya in the country where this disease is reported, after Adrar, Hodh el Gharbi, Hodh el Chargui, Tagant, Trarza, and Tiris Zemmour. In its daily bulletin, the ministry said that this result was obtained after the analysis of 948 samples (see https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=177436041482474&set=ecnf.100076482360984).

The total number of Mauritania's wilayat is 15; an administrative map, indicating the affected wilayat, is available in the said bulletin.

According to the daily Elilam dated Wed 28 Sep 2022, all affected animals are camels (https://elilam.net/node/18075). The apparent absence of reported cases in small ruminants, in particular sheep, which are regarded as the most RVF-susceptible species, is remarkable.

[The report above indicates that, in addition to RVF, there are 2 cases of Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever as well.

The numbers of affected livestock have increased from 14 Sep 2022, when the Ministry of Animal Development announced on that the number of livestock infected with RVF had risen to 149, distributed over several states. The report above indicates that the number is 231 cases in 7 regions.

People in the affected areas need to be aware of the risk of handling infected animals, including their slaughtering and processing, as well as fresh animal products (uncooked meat and crude milk). RVF virus can also be mosquito-transmitted. However, vector control over this large geographic area would be difficult. There is no vaccine available for humans. - Mod.TY
