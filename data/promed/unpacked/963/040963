Old salmonella strains
---------------
I wonder whether you can help me locate Salmonella strains collected in the
1950's or earlier. I want to look at the genomes of these strains to
determine whether there have been shifts since the introduction of antibiotics.

Are there, for example, typing centers that would have saved strains for
this long, and would be willing to share them?

Direction to someone who might have a suggestion would be greatly appreciated!
