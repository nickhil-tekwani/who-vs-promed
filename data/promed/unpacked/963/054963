NEW DELHI: Indian health experts have dubbed the reappearance of
human anthrax in several parts of southern India "an extremely
disturbing phenomenon." Anthrax outbreaks have occurred in pockets
of the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and
the union territory of Pondicherry in recent years.
"From 1990 to February 2000, 35 cases of human anthrax have been
documented in Pondicherry," Dr. T.K. Dutta, from Jawaharlal Nehru
Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research, said at the
Joint Annual Conference of the Association of Physicians of India in
Pondicherry. India is considered an endemic region for animal anthrax
because of a large unprotected and uncontrolled livestock population.
Human anthrax is also considered more or less endemic in southern
India. "The disease has never been contained in India due to lack of
vaccination efforts on the part of authorities [or? ineffective vaccines,"
Dutta said.
Anthrax is an animal disease that can be transmitted to humans who
come into contact with the [infected animals' skin, meat or blood.
Most [human cases occur when infected material comes into contact
with an open cut. About 20% of untreated cases of such "cutaneous"
anthrax will result in death.
Of 49 cases of [human anthrax reported by Christian Medical College
in Vellore, Tamil Nadu between 1977 and May 1996, 23 occurred in
1994-1995. "It is this increasing incidence and similar increasing trend
from Pondicherry which has alarmed us to its resurgence in southern
India," Dutta told Reuters Health.
Some 182 cases of human anthrax have been reported in India since
1953. "There have also been focal outbreaks in Mysore (South India)
and West Bengal in eastern India in the past 2 years," an official of the
National Institute of Communicable Diseases in Delhi told Reuters
Health. Experts are also concerned that many strains of anthrax are
being found resistant to penicillin, the drug of choice for treatment.

[For 1999, India reported to OIE (Office International des Epizooties)
80 bovine outbreaks with 228 animals affected, and 50 outbreaks
involving sheep and goats with 318 animals affected. I suspect that
these numbers are short. As far as I can tell from my Indian contacts
the national control policy for livestock anthrax is not actively pursued,
and many regional programmes are ineffective. Like most (countries)
they use the Sterne vaccine, which is perfectly adequate when deployed
properly. - Mod.MHJ
