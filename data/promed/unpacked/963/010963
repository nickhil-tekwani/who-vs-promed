Residents of the village of Bela Palanka are panicking because they found dead calves on the slopes of Suva planina. There are still no results from analysis, and veterinarians suspect the cause of death is anthrax, reports Serbian Daily Telegraf.

Predrag Pesic from the village of Mokra said that it had never happened that so many animals died suddenly, according to "B92". According to him and the people from the nearby villages of Kosmovac and Bela Palanka, they found dead animals without any signs of a struggle or bite. Mokra villagers raised suspicion of poisoning. They fear that the number of dead animals will rise, as currently it is greater than 10.

The vet Mladen Popovic says he does not believe that it is a disease, because in this case, more animals would die. Results of the analysis of the Veterinary Specialist Institute in Nis are expected in about 10 days.

[Anthrax usually starts with one animal from which others get infected in waves of 5-8 days. Over 10 animals quickly is more indicative of a poisoning. Secondly, the article has a photograph of a dead bovine with horns. Calves do not have horns. It is either a heifer or a young cow. [Newspapers do use library pictures as well as direct photo reporting. - Mod.SH] While the account may be confused and has lumped all the 10 plus dead animals into one village instead of 3 (Bela Palanka, Mokra, and Kosmovac), for the moment it would be best if this is just regarded as "suspected". Anthrax in Serbia is barely sporadic, with just one or 2 outbreaks each year involving cattle, sheep or horses.
