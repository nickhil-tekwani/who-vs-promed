At least 20 dairy cows have died and 3 people have been infected since an
outbreak of anthrax was discovered in Hua Hin district early this month.
More than 3500 cows aged over six months at the Thai-Danish Dairy Farm's
cooperatives at Ban Huay Sat Yai and Ban Pa Teng in Tambon Huay Sat Yai,
have been vaccinated to prevent the spread of the disease. Tambon Huay Sat
Yai was earlier declared an epidemic control zone after tests showed a cow
from Ban Huay Sat Yai had died of anthrax.
Dr Vichai Vejosotsakda of the Phetchaburi Public Health Office said he
believed the cows belonging to cooperative contracted anthrax from cattle
smuggled in from Burma. When the cows that contracted anthrax died, the
owners consumed the meat and became infected. He said symptoms of the 3
patients were not serious -- only inflammation of the skin -- and that the
disease would be brought under control very soon.
Dr Somsak Vatanasri of the Public Health Ministry's Epidemiology Division
said the ministry and other concerned agencies knew well how to cope with
the outbreak, and that the more worrisome problem was the smuggling of
cattle along the border, as most of the smuggled cattle were not vaccinated
and were often found to be carriers of anthrax bacteria.
Dr Supamitr Chunsuthivat, director of the General Communicable Diseases
Division, explained anthrax has been around in Thailand for a long time, but
has never reached epidemic proportions, and most of the cases occurred along
border provinces particularly in the North and Northeast. He said the 3
victims in Hua Hin were the first cases to be reported this year.

[This is the traditional pattern of livestock & human anthrax in Thailand.
Anthrax 'carriers' are unlikely but latent infections are long suspected. It
is more likely that they are incubating the disease while being smuggled
