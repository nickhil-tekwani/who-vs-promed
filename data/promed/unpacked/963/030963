West Nile virus human cases, 1st in 2007, confirmed
-------------------------------------------------------
The Mississippi Department of Health today confirmed the state's 1st
human cases of West Nile virus this year, with one each in Lawrence
and Walthall counties. West nile virus is a year-round virus,
according to interim State Epidemiologist Dr. Lovetta Brown.
"Personal protection is the key to avoiding mosquito bites. Take
steps to keep the areas in and around homes mosquito-free," Brown
said in a news release.

[Mississippi joins the ranks of states with year-around West Nile
virus (WNV) transmission. As mean annual temperatures continue to
increase in the southeastern states and west coast, we can expect to
see areas of year-around WNV transmission move northward. A map of
