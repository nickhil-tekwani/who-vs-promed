[African swine fever (ASF) remains one of the most devastative
infections in the pig industry and its control is difficult in the
absence of a vaccine and the presence of reservoir hosts such as the
warthogs, bush pigs and soft ticks which inhabit the burrows of
warthogs. The last outbreak in the country was in October 2008 around
Erongo region which is further south and closer to the capital,
Windhoek, while other previous outbreaks were in 2001 and 2005 and
were relatively isolated cases. ASF is an infection which can cause
havoc and should be handled judiciously.

In the OIE report there is a map with the location of Omusati region
in the north which shares borders with Angola. Angola has experience
recent outbreaks of in 20005 to 2008 but no reports of ASF in 2009.
In 2008, there were 16 outbreaks reported in November(1), October(3),
September(1) and August(9), January(2). In 2007 there were 2
outbreaks, 2006 -- 3 outbreaks, and 2005 -- 3 outbreaks in Angola.
Namibia last OIE report, on the other hand, was 1 outbreak in January
2005. Given the potential for porous movement through Angola's
southern border and transboundary spread of this disease, ProMED-mail
would appreciate any information on the presence or lack of ASF
outbreaks in Angola at this time. - Mods.FE/PC]
