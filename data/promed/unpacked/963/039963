[Re: ProMED-mail Filariasis - Indonesia: (EK) 20120409.1094954]
---------------------------------------------------------------
This is not really 'news' -- sadly. Both _Wuchereria bancrofti_ and _Brugia malayi_ remain prevalent infections in many rural areas of Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo). A 70 percent infection prevalence as indicated in the cited article is unusually high but well within probability. It is not known what "test' was used to make the diagnosis in the 1st place and what species of filarial worm is involved. The notion that "disease control experts [are] scrambling to contain an outbreak" is only reflective of the poor health care coverage and surveillance in many rural areas of Indonesia to begin with.

The high number of apparent infections (more likely _W. bancrofti_) detected in Sebakung Jaya Village would not be consistent of an 'outbreak' per se. With a disease that typically has a pre-patent period of around one year or more, the reported infections are reflective of long-term, persistent transmission.

To my knowledge, lymphatic filarial infections do not lead to "blindness" (although several cases of ophthalmofilariasis have been recorded presumably with _W. bancrofti_ and _B. malayi_). Furthermore, acute inflammation rarely, if ever, leads to a rapid (rather eventual) progression of chronic stage fibrosis and hypertrophy of affected tissues producing elephantiasis. Damage to the lymphatic system takes time and presumably aggravated by multiple overlapping infection episodes. Not all persons infected with lymphatic filariae go on to develop elephantiasis and the most extreme cases represent a small percentage of the entire infected population.

Lastly, the statement that "A mass drug administration initiative to prevent filariasis [_W. bancrofti_] in Bandung [West Java] in late 2009 resulted in 9 deaths believed to be linked to the free medication meant to fight the disease." is misleading and the association of diethylcarbamazine [DEC] albendazole + paracetamol having caused or contributed to those unfortunate deaths is highly questionable.

[ProMED-mail thanks Michael J Bangs for his comments. We certainly agree that deaths due to treatment with DEC and albendazole are extremely rare and should not prevent patients with filariasis from receiving treatment. - Mod.EP
