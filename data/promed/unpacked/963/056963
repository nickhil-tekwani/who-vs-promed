Nunavut's whooping cough (pertussis) outbreak has now spread throughout the territory, according to a public health advisory issued today 17 Oct 2016 by the territory's Department of Health. Earlier in October 2016, cases were confirmed in Igloolik. A total of 4 other communities in the Baffin region - Cape Dorset, Hall Beach, Pond Inlet and Iqaluit - had previously reported confirmed cases. The advisory says whooping cough is "a serious and active health concern."

Iqaluit pertussis cases now up to 29 and cases in Pond Inlet rose to 13.

Babies who get whooping cough can become very sick. Officials are urging pregnant women in their last trimester and their families to get vaccinated at their local health centre to protect babies from being infected.

[Most of the morbidity and mortality from pertussis occurs in infants less than 6 months of age, especially neonates. Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different, with periods of apnea [breathing arrest] sometimes with hypoxia-induced [low oxygen] seizures usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000 and severe pulmonary hypertension, are ominous signs for mortality.

In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental oxygen in the hospital, and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care.

A 2014 publication confirms the safety of maternal pertussis immunization: Kharbanda EO, Vazquez-Benitez G, Lipkind HS, et al: Evaluation of the association of maternal pertussis vaccination with obstetric events and birth outcomes.
