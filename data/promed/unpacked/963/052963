About 100 people in at least seven states have become ill recently with an
unusual form of _Salmonella_, according to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.
Six people in Illinois have been hospitalized in the past two months with
_Salmonella agona_ infections, according to Carl Langkop, an epidemiologist
who is chief of the Communicable Diseases Control Branch of the Illinois
Department of Public Health. Because _Salmonella agona_ is so unusual,
doctors suspect that the cases are from a single source, but have not yet
tracked that down. The bacterium is found in chicken, turkeys, cattle and
pigs. Dr. Laurence Slutsker, a medical epidemiologist with the CDC, said
that there are no reports of deaths from the illness.
The cases started in early April, and Illinois received reports of four new
illnesses Thursday, Langkop said.
The investigation is centered in Illinois, where there are more cases than
any other state. In a normal year, Illinois records about 40 cases of
_Salmonella agona_ illnesses; in the last seven weeks alone, 34 cases have
been confirmed.
Cases also have been recorded in Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, Michigan, New
York and Pennsylvania.
The CDC is now launching a new system [Pulse Net - Mod.PC] that can track
such outbreaks in the future. The system lets epidemiologists track the DNA
fingerprints of individual strains of _Salmonella_. But right now, the CDC
does not know what is causing the current outbreak.
