Migratory birds may be the cause of bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
The 2 areas where birds tested positive for the H5N1 virus were a haven for
migratory birds. Perak Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Mohamad Tajol Rosli Ghazali
said the Ecopark of Bukit Merah Laketown Resort near Taiping was renowned
for migratory birds, while Kampung Changkat Tualang in Kota Baru near
Gopeng was near a bird sanctuary. "The infection could be from migratory
birds," he said at a press conference yesterday [16 Mar 2006]. "As such, I
have instructed that all bird sanctuaries, such as Kuala Gula, Teja and
Kampung Gajah, be monitored closely."
Tajol Rosli said 38 749 birds located within a one km radius of the
affected areas would be culled to prevent the virus from spreading. "We
sympathize with the farmers and the resort, but we have to cull the birds,
chickens and ducks so that the virus does not spread to commercial farms,"
he added.
Tajol Rosli said the state had the biggest chicken and duck industry in the
country, with poultry exported to Singapore. "If we are quick in culling
the birds located within the one km radius, it will be faster for those
areas to be declared bird flu-free," he said. "It is not a problem for
people to continue visiting the Ecopark if the birds have been culled."
He said that 500 kampung (free range) chickens at Kampung Changkat Tualang
and chickens and ducks at a poultry farm nearby would also be culled. "The
farm has 8000 day-old chicks, 20 000 day-old ducks and 10 000 ducks that
were 50 days old," he said.
At the Ecopark, a total of 249 birds from 30 different species will be
culled. "The birds, some of which were trained by the resort staff, are on
an island," he said.

Another outbreak of bird flu [Malaysia]
-----------------------------------------------
2 cases of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian flu strain have been detected
in Perak. Agriculture and Agro-based Industry Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin
Yassin said one case was detected at the Ecopark in Bukit Merah Laketown
Resort, a tourist spot. "As a routine surveillance, we sent five fecal
samples of birds to the Veterinary Research Institute for testing on 9 Mar
2006. The presence of the virus was confirmed yesterday [Wed 15 Mar 2006],"
he said in a statement here Thursday.
There are 249 birds from 30 species living in an enclosed area at the
Ecopark. When contacted, MK Land Holdings executive chairman Tan Sri
Mustapha Kamal Abu Bakar, whose company owns Bukit Merah Laketown, said the
0.404 ha bird park at the 1.2 ha resort would be closed indefinitely. He
said, however, business elsewhere in the resort would go on as usual.
The other case, Muhyiddin said, was detected in Kampung Changkat Tualang,
some 100 km from the Ecopark, after villagers reported the suspicious
deaths of 9 chickens to authorities. Officers from the Perak Veterinary
Services Department took samples from the chicks at a poultry farm in
Kampung Changkat Tualang near Gopeng on Thursday [date?]. "We received the
report last Saturday. Testing confirmed the virus yesterday [16 Mar 2006].
Staff from the Health Ministry will be going to the affected areas to
conduct surveillance on residents there," he said, adding that staff began
culling all birds and chickens within one km of the affected areas last night.
Muhyiddin urged the public not to move any chickens or fowl out of the 2
affected areas.
At a press conference, Veterinary Services Department acting
director-general Datuk Dr Mustapa Jalil said the affected village was near
to a chicken and duck farm. "I have recalled all the enforcement officers
in the state. We will have a team of some 50 officers to cull the birds and
conduct surveillance within the 10 km radius of the affected area," he said.
On the source of the virus, Dr Mustapa said in the case of Ecopark, it was
possible that the virus could have been transmitted by migratory birds at a
large lake nearby. "Currently, we would advise those hoping to visit the
Ecopark in Bukit Merah resort to stay away from the bird enclosure. But
they can still visit other areas at the tourist spot," he said.
The latest cases came just as the authorities were embarking on a final
operation within a 10-km radius of the villages in Setapak where the virus
1st surfaced before declaring the country free of avian flu.

I am not a legal expert, so I do not know the exact laws of Malaysia that
may apply or exempt them from other treaty agreements, but other options
are on the table:
International treaties and national laws regarding endangered and/migratory
species may or may not apply to specific actions related to the euthanasia
(culling) of birds in a collection in one particular country. Regardless of
legal restrictions, alternatives to euthanasia exist for captive
collections of birds and include identification marking, quarantine and
testing of individuals at risk, as well as these steps coupled with
vaccination. These approaches as scientifically, ethically, and
economically sound alternatives are being discussed by government
authorities in many countries around the world and have been agreed upon in
a number of countries as options for avian influenza control, just as they
have in the past for other infectious diseases found in well managed,
captive collections.

Penang bird park culls fowl as precaution
-----------------------------------------------
Penang Bird Park officers in Seberang Jaya here have slaughtered the few
chickens, ducks and geese in the premises. This follows the discovery of
bird flu cases at Bukit Merah Laketown Resort and at Kampung Changkat
Tualang in Perak. Park director Dr Gino H.C. Ooi said that although the
park's 20 chickens, 5 ducks and 7 geese were free from the virus, the
management took the decision to slaughter the birds. He said the rest of
the park's attractions were wild birds and unlikely to be at risk. "We
strongly believe that the virus does not affect wild birds, because they
have a natural immunity against the H5N1 avian flu strain," he said.
"Poultry is more susceptible because of inbreeding. To produce chickens
that can lay more eggs or have leaner meat, poultry breeders practice
inbreeding. But this causes the birds to have a weaker immune system."
The park has over 2500 birds of 300 different species, both local and those
found around the globe.
At the Bukit Merah Laketown Resort, it was business as usual. However, the
22 staff members at the resort's Ecopark had been asked to undergo medical
check ups, said general manager Calvin Ho. He said the resort's
veterinarian had been sending samples to the Veterinary Research Institute
on a regular basis following the bird flu outbreak in Gombak, Selangor, in
late February 2006. "We believe the virus might have originated from the
droppings of migratory birds, as the resort is located along their flight
path," he said.

Highlights include swan and duck ponds and a walk-in aviary that houses 800
birds from around the world, an on-site children's area, collection of
native plants, and dining at The Bird Park restaurant."

"Penang Bird Park, Seberang Jaya: The 1st and largest bird park of its kind
in Malaysia. Established in 1988, the 5-acre park on the mainland portion
of Penang State has a collection of more that 300 species of birds from all
over the world, of which more than 150 species are of Malaysian species.
More than 3000 birds in this park are carefully and scientifically housed
in more than 150 cages for breeding and conservation purposes. The Geodesic
Domes and 2 giant sized Walk-in-Aviaries keep hundreds of tamed birds,
which offer a priceless memory and exciting moment for visitors upon
hand-feeding them. Exotic birds ranging from tiny sunbirds to huge,
gigantic 8-foot tall Ostriches frolic in an environment that imitates their
natural habitat. Penang Bird Park is particularly proud of its hornbill,
sunbird, and pheasant collection." It is an avian zoological garden. - Mod.MHJ]
