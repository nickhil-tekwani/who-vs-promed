The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Travel Alert on 30 Sep 2021, regarding an ongoing outbreak of monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

The World Health Organization recently reported over 8800 monkeypox cases in Africa during 2021.

Monkeypox is a rare, sometimes fatal disease caused by a virus. The 1st symptoms of monkeypox include fever, malaise, headache, and sometimes sore throat and cough. A distinguishing feature of monkeypox from smallpox is lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes).

The CDC says visitors to the DRC can protect themselves from monkeypox by washing their hands often and avoiding contact with wild animals and products made from wild animals. Furthermore, international travelers should also avoid contact with people who are sick.

Recently, the WHO reported 9 suspected monkeypox cases in Nigeria in August 2021. Nigeria is located to the west of the DRC in Africa.

There is a preventive monkeypox vaccine available in the US.

The JYNNEOS (IMVANEX, IMVAMUNE) vaccine was initially approved by the US FDA in 2019 and is indicated for preventing smallpox and monkeypox.

On 21 Jun 2021, the US FDA issued an update for JYNNEOS for adults 18 years of age and older.

JYNNEOS is based on a live, attenuated vaccinia virus (Modified Vaccinia Ankara, MVA-BN), incapable of replicating in the body, yet still capable of eliciting a potent immune response monkeypox disease in adults 18 years of age and older determined to be at high risk for smallpox or monkeypox infection.

During the US CDC's vaccine committee meeting on 29 Sep 2021, Agam Rao, MD CAPT presented the 'US Public Health Service, presented: Background information to interpret GRADE tables and Evidence to Recommendations framework about JYNNEOS vaccine.'

However, this smallpox-monkeypox vaccine is not recommended for the general public in the USA and is only available from authorized providers.

[It is interesting to note that a vaccine against monkeypox (MPX) is now available for human use. Because MPX cases are rare, the challenge will be to determine who, amongst a large population in those countries where MPX virus is endemic, is at risk of infection and should receive the vaccine.

Although the wildlife reservoirs have not been determined, the recommendation above to avoid contact with them is prudent. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of the prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports.

The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp, an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so the continued occurrence of cases can be expected. MPX virus can be transmitted between people, but not readily. - Mod.TY
