First report of _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ in tomato in Belgium
------------------------------------------------------------------
During August 2006, a sample of a tomato plant (_Solanum
lycopersicum_, formerly _Lycopersicum esculentum_) from a greenhouse
in Belgium was received for diagnosis. The plant showed severe growth
reduction and the young leaves were chlorotic and distorted. In the
greenhouse, the disease had been spreading slowly along the row.
These observations suggested the presence of a viroid infection, and
reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR [polymerase chain reaction] for
pospiviroids yielded a positive result (amplicons of approximately
196 and 360 base pairs). Sequence analysis of the larger amplicon
[PCR product] revealed that the genome was 358 nucleotides and 100
percent identical to 2 previously published isolates of _Potato
spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd) from the United Kingdom and Australia.
A pathogen associated with the symptomatic tomato plants was
therefore identified as PSTVd.
Tracing the origin of the infection revealed the following
information: during November 2005, 8-day-old tomato seedlings raised
from seed by a Dutch nursery were transferred to a small part of the
greenhouse of the Belgian grower; 7 to 8 weeks later, the plants were
transplanted to their final destination; during May 2006, the grower
first observed growth reduction in a single plant; several weeks
later, similar symptoms were observed in 2 more plants in the same
row close to the 1st symptomatic plant; and by September [2006],
there were approximately 20 symptomatic tomato plants, all located in
2 adjacent rows.
The viroid outbreak was fully eradicated by destroying all tomato
plants in the affected rows as well as in 2 adjacent rows at both
sides. The absence of further infections was confirmed by testing
approximately 1200 tomato plants in pooled samples for PSTVd by
RT-PCR (2) and real-time RT-PCR (1). The origin and the method of
introduction and spread of the viroid remain unclear.

[_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd; type member of genus
_Pospiviroid_) is an important pathogen of solanaceous crops, causing
the diseases 'spindle tuber' in potato and 'bunchy top' in tomato.
Yield losses can be up to 65 percent in potato and as much as 50
percent in tomato. Symptoms in tomatoes include stunting, leaf
chlorosis and distortion, and shortening of internodes. All varieties
of tomato and potato appear to be susceptible, with no natural
resistance to PSTVd available in either host. Other solanaceous crop
and weed species are also susceptible to PSTVd.
Spread occurs via infected plants or plant parts, seed, pollen,
mechanical means, or plant-to-plant contact. Only in the presence of
_Potato leafroll virus_ (PLRV; genus _Polerovirus_), PSTVd can also
be transmitted by an aphid vector (_Myzus persicae_). PSTVd (like
viroids in general) is exceptionally stable due to its molecular
structure and can survive in sap or leaf litter for considerable time.
PSTVd has been found in many countries around the world, including
parts of North and South America, Asia, and Oceania. The pathogen is
not endemic to Western Europe, but in recent years outbreaks have
been reported in France, UK, Germany, and the Netherlands. In
addition, the disease is established in Eastern Europe, including for
example Poland and Russia. The European Plant Protection Organisation
(EPPO) has therefore listed PSTVd as an A2 quarantine pathogen.
