Abstract
--------
To analyze the whole genome sequence and pathogenicity of H9N2 subtype influenza virus carried by pet dogs in Guangxi, we amplified and sequenced the whole genome by RT-PCR. The amino acid homology and evolutionary tree were analyzed in DNA-Star and MEGA 6.0 software, and pathogenicity was studied through mouse infection experiments. 8 gene segments of 13 H9N2 strains were derived from 5 different lineages, which belonged to the new genotype. The amino acid sequence identity was 99.0% with respect to A/equine/Guangxi/3/2011 isolated from Guangxi. 6 internal genes were closely related to the H7N9 strain from human influenza virus in 2013. The HA cleavage site of all strains was RSSR-(cleavage site)-GLF, thus indicating low virulence. The amino acid sites HA226, NA119, NP375, and PB2 showed some changes, among which HA226 was changed to leucine L, which binds human SAalpha2, 6-Gal. In BALB/c mice infected with H9N2 virus isolated from healthy dogs, the virus did not replicate in vivo, but the strains Ca/GX/8 and Ca/GX/10 from symptomatic dogs replicated in vivo and caused clear clinical symptoms but not death. The virulence of the virus was enhanced after passage in mice, a finding speculated to be caused by the changes in amino acids at positions PA623 and 611 of PB2. A total of 13 H9N2 subtype influenza virus strains obtained from dogs in Guangxi have avian origin, specifically bind human receptors, and have a complex genetic evolution relationship, thus posing a great threat to mammals and humans. Therefore, prevention and control measures must urgently be strengthened.

"It's worth mentioning that influenza A(H9N2) viruses are enzootic in poultry populations in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Most human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness.

Avian H9N2 influenza A virus has caused repeated human infections in Asia since 1998. An H9N2 influenza virus infected a 5-year-old child in Hong Kong in 2003. The human H9N2 influenza virus, A/Hong Kong/2108/03, is of purely avian origin and is closely related to some viruses circulating in poultry in the markets of Hong Kong. The continued presence of H9N2 influenza viruses in poultry markets in southern China increases the likelihood of avian-to-human interspecies transmission. Since the mid-1990s, 2 lineages of H9N2 influenza A viruses have become established in domestic poultry in southern China, Duck/HK/Y280/97 (Y280-like) and Quail/HK/G1/97 (G1-like) viruses, which are predominantly found in chickens and quail, respectively. These viruses have been sporadically introduced into humans and cause a flu-like illness. In the meantime, H9N2 influenza Y280-like viruses were also isolated from domestic pigs in Hong Kong in 1998. These findings indicate that the interspecies transmission of H9N2 influenza virus from avian to mammalian hosts continues to occur and poses a persistent threat for humans.

Furthermore, the number of human infections with A/H9N2 avian influenza viruses has been higher in 2021 (13 cases including the new case from China [covered in https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2021/05/hk-chpwho-wpro-report-another-h9n2-case.html] as of 8 May 2021 -- compared with earlier years, which is a cause for concern and highlights the need for continuous monitoring and risk assessments of these viruses with pandemic potential."

Further studies of the dog-derived A(H9N2) virus strain, while checking its pathogenicity rate in birds, are warranted. It will be interesting to note if and what contact the investigated pet dogs had with poultry, or if they were fed with uncooked poultry meat. - Mod.AS
