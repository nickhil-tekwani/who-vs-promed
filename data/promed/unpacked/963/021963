The laboratory of the Istituto Superiore di Sanit E0-ISS (Superior
Institute of Health), the leading technical and scientific public
body of the Italian National Health Service, has confirmed that the
blood samples, taken from patients in the small city of Castiglione
(province in Ravenna, Italy), have resulted positive for the
mosquito-borne chikungunya fever [virus].
Meanwhile other clinical cases are emerging in neighboring places.
Castiglione is a few kilometers south south-east of Ravenna, in
Emilia Romagna Region, Italy.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Pavan for the additional information about the
chikungunya virus outbreak in Italy. Given the potential of mobility
of virus-infected people before they become too ill to move far, it
is not surprising that this virus is being transported to nearby
areas where _Aedes albopictus_ vectors are present, extending the
region of the outbreak. ProMED would be interested in receiving
further reports on the extent of the outbreak, the numbers of cases
occurring over time, and success of the vector control efforts.
