A 37-year-old man from the Shfela region [South-center Israel] was bitten at his leg by a jackal during an excursion to the Ein Harod Ihud fishponds, in the Gilboa Region, northern Israel ["Hazafon"]. He is the 8th person bitten by jackals in the area during the past 2 months.[map at http://tinyurl.com/yax4hccg].

The traveler told the medical staff that while he was struggling with the jackal, a woman had shot the animal with a rifle. The woman, who holds a permit to shoot pests of agriculture, was working nearby. The bitten man's condition is defined as mild, and he is treated in the emergency room at Ha'emek Hospital in Afula. Later, he will receive post-exposure vaccinations.

The Nature and Parks Authority [NPA] said that at first it was unknown what had happened to the jackal and NPA patrols searched for it in the area. Later on, the inspectors found a jackal behaving strangely; it was shot dead and sent for lab examinations.

Earlier today [Sat 18 Nov 2017], a jackal attacked a cat in the Moshav Sdey-Trumot in the southern part of the Springs Valley. The jackal was shot and killed, and the carcass was sent to the laboratory to determine if he had the disease. The cat was quarantined. The day before yesterday [Thu 16 Nov 2017] the Health Ministry said that a cow from the dairy farm in the village of Yokneam was found positive for rabies.

The Gilboa Regional Council says that "the authorities must declare an emergency situation and handle effectively the 2 emerging wildlife populations - jackals and boars - which have increased beyond reasonable limits, breaching natural balance. Appropriate budget for these activities should be secured. We also call upon the residents to obey the instructions that have been published in order to protect everybody against the serious, life threatening disease". Residents of the area have described the recent events as "sharp and dramatic".

At the beginning of the week [week of Sun 12 Nov 2017], a sick sheep was discovered in Moshav Ramat Zvi, and later an infected cat in the settlement of Gan Ner, where it behaved strangely and attacked dogs. Residents of these 2 communities, belonging to the Gilboa Regional Council, were called upon to vaccinate all domestic animals, including those vaccinated during the past year [2016]. Infected animals were discovered in Beit Shean, Afula and the regional councils of the Valley of Springs, Jezreel Valley and Gilboa, spreading as far as Ein Hashofet. [several additional human and pets exposures are described].

The Gilboa Regional Council claimed this week [week of Sun 12 Nov 2017] that the Ministry of Agriculture has cut the number of oral vaccine baits spread from the air. "For some reason, at the end of 2015, oral vaccines were not distributed in the same quantity as in previous years, and the result is probably what we are experiencing now". They added: "The authorities must change their approach in terms of reducing the density of the jackal population, moving to a deeper deeper dilution."

The Ministry of Agriculture has denied claims that the number of vaccinations has been cut. However, according to the ministry's data, in the fall of 2015 only 175 000 baits were dispersed [countrywide], compared to 375 000 the year before. Last year (2016) the number of baits increased to 475 000. The ministry could not provide an unequivocal explanation to the current explosive outbreak in the area.

The Ministry of Agriculture said in response that "the Veterinary Services of the Ministry of Agriculture are working in cooperation with the Israel Nature and Parks Authority to prevent the spread of the disease and are annually dispersing an oral vaccine from the air that contains an immune vaccine intended for wild animals such as jackals and foxes." In the past year [2016], it was decided to disperse an increased number of vaccine baits.

"Any contact with stray dogs and cats and with wild animals should be avoided. It is forbidden to adopt a stray animal before being examined by a veterinarian. Sick wild animals should not be approached or treated, due to rabies risk. "

"In the past 3 years, Israel has cooperated with Jordan in the matter of dispersing baits, and we hope that this year [2017] we will enjoy a similar cooperation."

[The striking recent spread of rabies in the valleys of north-east Israel, mainly involving jackals, may be clearly visualized by visiting and comparing the 2 following rabies maps, published by Israel's national rabies laboratory at the Kimron Veterinary Institute (note also the decreased number of cases in dogs, during 2017, along the Lebanese border):

1. 2016 (01 Jan - 31 Dec):

<www.moag.gov.il/vet/Yechidot/Machon/maabada_kalevet/airueim%20kalevet/Documents/mapa_kalevet_13.11.17.jpg>

Since [Mon 13 Nov 2017], 5 additional rabies cases have been reported from the same area, of which 2 are yet to be lab-confirmed.

Jackals are declared by law as a protected species in Israel. However, the law empowers the relevant Ministries to allow control measures undertaken in certain circumstances, predominantly for the protection of public health. In case the disease continues its march westwards, it may reach the abundant, urban jackal population in and around the city of Haifa.

No human case of rabies has been recorded in Israel since 2003. - Mod.AS
