Four horses have tested positive for glanders -- a highly contagious and often fatal zoonotic disease -- in Chhattisgarh's Durg and Rajnandgaon, and the state administration has imposed restrictions on the movement of equines in and out of the 2 areas. One horse tested positive for glanders in Durg, and 3 horses tested positive in Rajnandgaon.

In response to an urgent letter from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India regarding a report that the deadly zoonotic disease was detected in horses in the state, the animal husbandry department of Chhattisgarh issued a circular notifying the municipal corporation areas of Durg and Rajnandgaon as "controlled areas" and imposing restrictions on movement of equines in and out.

The circular directed that all disease-hit equines in the controlled area of a minimum 5 km [3.1 mi] radius be euthanised. It also directed that all equines in the controlled area and 25% of the equines beyond the controlled area, up to 25 km [15.5 mi] (5-25 km), be screened.

As per the circular, beyond 25 km [15.5 mi], in all 27 districts of the state, the district animal husbandry department must undertake a physical or sero-surveillance programme for the equines. It states that provisions of the Prevention and Control of Infectious and Contagious Diseases in Animals Act 2009 must be implemented mandatorily, a PETA statement said.

In its letter, PETA India had urged the state government to ban the use of horses for weddings and other ceremonies, citing the potential and possibly fatal threat to humans who come in contact with infected horses.

"Horses forced to pull overloaded carts and paraded during weddings commonly face being controlled through the use of weapons like spiked bits fitted into their mouths, thirst, malnourishment, untreated injuries, and other pain, and now their use is exposing Chhattisgarh's citizens to the risk of dangerous zoonotic diseases like glanders," Manilal Valliyate, veterinarian and CEO of PETA India, said.

Glanders is a contagious, fatal disease in horses, mules, and donkeys caused by the bacteria _Burkholderia mallei_ and characterised by the serial development of ulcerating nodules commonly found in the upper respiratory tract, in the lungs, and on the skin. Humans may become infected with the disease through contact with infected animals or inhalation, and it can affect the skin, lungs, and entire body and, in the absence of proper treatment, can lead to a painful death.

Glanders, a zoonotic, OIE-listed equid disease, is endemic in India. According to the OIE records, the annual numbers of reported glanders outbreaks (in Equidae) countrywide in India in 2017 (the most recent available full annual report) was 106, of which not a single one reported from Chhattisgarh (89 were in Uttar Pradesh).

Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form, known as "farcy," also occurs. Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of reactors. Glanders is transmissible to humans by direct contact with diseased animals or with infected or contaminated material. In the untreated acute disease, the mortality rate can reach 95% within 3 weeks. However, survival is possible if the infected person is treated early and aggressively with multiple systemic antibiotic therapies. In fact, fatal cases, which were known to be common, have become rather uncommon.

In view of its zoonotic potential, all infected or contaminated (or potentially infected or contaminated) material must be handled in a laboratory with appropriate biosafety and biosecurity controls following a bio-risk analysis.

The above and additional information on glanders, its causative agent, and its diagnosis is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.05.11_GLANDERS.pdf. A useful updated review on the disease, including its recent global distribution, is available in reference 1.

No vaccine against this disease is available. No statistics on the incidence of glanders in humans in India could be obtained. - Mod.AS
