Mystery disease kills 37 more kids in UP
----------------------------------------
In the last 2 days, 37 more children have succumbed to the mysterious viral
disease in western Uttar Pradesh, taking the death toll to 177 since its
outbreak. In Saharanpur, where the highest number of deaths (98) were
reported, 17 children died of the disease, which produces symptoms
consistent with Japanese encephalitis and meningitis, officials said in
Ghaziabad.
At least 6 more died in Muzaffarnagar, while 4 succumbed to the disease at
Bagpat. 8 children died in Bulandshahr district, while 2 died in Ghaziabad,
they said.
In addition, the director of health, Meerut, Dr SK Arora, said that blood
samples from the patients had been tested by the Institute of Virology, the
Institute of Communicable Diseases, and the All India Institute of Medical
Science, New Delhi, but no concrete conclusion could be drawn on the nature
of the virus.

[The death toll due to this as yet undiagnosed outbreak continues to climb.
(In the last report of 9 Nov 2004, there were 98 deaths attributed to this
outbreak; there are now 177). We have heard from other sources that there
may be 2 different outbreaks involved in Uttar Pradesh, but the media
persist in referring to this as a single, as yet undiagnosed, outbreak in
Western Uttar Pradesh.
As we have heard nothing from authoritative sources within the Indian
Ministry of Health, or the Department of Health of Uttar Pradesh, or from
international organizations that may be working in the region, it seems
appropriate to repeat the previous posting's moderator comment here, with
minor editing to update this report. "This is now the [6th] posting in this
thread of these "undiagnosed deaths" in Uttar Pradesh, India. In earlier
newswires, there were descriptions of "malaria" and "cholera," but also, of
encephalitis. With the encephalitis description, we did speculate that
Japanese encephalitis might be the etiologic agent responsible for this
"undiagnosed" outbreak, not unrelated to the observations that Uttar
Pradesh has annual outbreaks of Japanese encephalitis. In all prior
postings, we have requested more information from official sources, hoping
that one of our subscribers in India, or among the international public
health community, might have some information based on the actual
investigations rather than on the newswires we have been posting. While
Japanese encephalitis is the most likely etiology, we should not forget
that henipavirus has been responsible for unusual encephalitis outbreaks in
Bangladesh and North Bengal in India. A lack of a definitive diagnosis of
Japanese encephalitis now [7+] weeks following the 1st newswire posting
might be considered cause for concern. - Mod.MPP]
