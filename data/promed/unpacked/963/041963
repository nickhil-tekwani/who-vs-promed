["Rabies is still a pervasive global threat. Half of the world's population live in an endemic area, and more than 80% of deaths occur in rural areas, where access to health-education campaigns and post-bite prophylaxis is limited or inexistent. Africa and Asia are the continents with the highest risk of human mortality, with more than 95% of the world's fatal cases. These regions are also those where canine rabies is controlled the least."
