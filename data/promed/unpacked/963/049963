Farmer Brand peanuts recalled
-----------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency advised the public last night not to
eat some kinds of Farmer Brand peanuts that may be contaminated with
_Salmonella_ bacteria.
Importer Le Kiu Importing Co. Ltd., of Vancouver, has voluntarily recalled
the products, which have been distributed in B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan,
Manitoba, and the Yukon.
One product, garlic flavoured Peanuts, may have been distributed
nationwide. The recalled Farmer Brand peanuts are:
Name / Package size / UPC code number
Shandong Peanuts / 180-gram / 0 82312 12406 3
Garlic Flavour Peanuts / 180-gram / 0 82312 12401 8
Dried Peanuts / 200-gram / 0 82312 12350 9
Dried Peanuts / 400-gram / 0 82312 12351 6
Roasted Peanuts / 200-gram / 0 82312 12345 5
Roasted Peanuts / 400-gram / 0 82312 12349 3
Food contaminated with _Salmonella_ bacteria may not look or smell spoiled.
The products should not be consumed by humans or animals, and should be
disposed of immediately.
Common symptoms of _Salmonella_ infection are nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain, and diarrhea, although more serious consequences are possible.
There have been several reported _Salmonella_ illnesses in Canada.

[This is the same brand of peanuts recalled by Australian authorities for
_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Stanley contamination earlier this month
(see ProMED-mail reference cited above). It is unclear whether the
Canadian isolates are the same serotype, or whether the illnesses reported
here have been conclusively linked to peanut consumption. Further
information would be welcomed. - Mod.ES
