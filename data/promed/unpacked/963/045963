Preventing introduction and spread of avian influenza among bird flocks in
Europe: recommendations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
by European Animal Health Panel
A series of recommendations to prevent the entry and transmission of avian
influenza among bird flocks in Europe has been made by the European Food
Safety Authority's Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) [1].
The panel considered the risks posed by avian influenza, migrating and
imported birds, and bird products. The most serious risk identified was
that of the potential mutation of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI)
into highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). The AHAW panel recommended
that LPAI strains H5 and H7 be subject to notification and control by
legislation, just as HPAI now is because, in the past, these have mutated
to highly pathogenic strains.
Contact between poultry and wild migratory birds that could carry avian
influenza is a risk that cannot be entirely eliminated. The panel
recommended that biosecurity measures, such as limiting movements and
contacts of animals and people between farms, should be increased. The
panel also recommended more education of farmers about avian influenza, and
structured cooperation between avian influenza epidemiologists and
ornithologists who map migratory bird routes.
The import of live birds and bird products from countries where there have
been recent outbreaks of avian influenza is already banned in the European
Union [2,3]. The panel believe this will be a more effective measure if
LPAI is included and recognised by this legislation, and if the legislation
is properly enforced. Import controls concerning live birds and poultry
should be further tightened.
As poultry faeces are important means of spreading LPAI and HPAI viruses,
the panel recommended that only appropriately treated faeces and litter
should be permitted to be traded as animal manure. Poultry feathers and
down which may be faecally contaminated must also be treated before
importation.
Other key recommendations included the development of early warning systems
for detection of LPAI, the identification of high-risk exposure areas
(close proximity to migratory bird pathways or wintering sites), safe
distances being established between farms, regional planning rules for
areas densely populated with poultry, contingency plans for mass culling of
poultry in case of outbreaks, and the use of certain humane culling methods
named by the panel. In the event of outbreaks, vaccination should also be
considered as a control measure, if used in combination with other control
measures.
The recommendations were presented at a meeting of the Chief Medical and
Veterinary Officers on avian influenza at the European Commission on 22 Sep
2005 [4].The conclusions of this meeting included a recognition of the need
for consistent and coordinated actions by national veterinary and public
health authorities in preparing for the event of an avian influenza
outbreak. More cooperation between public and animal health surveillance
systems, epidemiologists and virologists is required, as well as more
support for countries experiencing avian influenza outbreaks. Finally the
meeting participants concluded that there was an urgent need to update
avian influenza contingency plans and pandemic preparedness plans in all
European countries.

for the Middle East, Manama (Bahrain), 26-29 Sep 2005 [edited]
<http://oie.int/eng/press/en_050929.htm>

The Government of the Kingdom of Bahrain kindly agreed to host the 8th
Conference of the OIE Regional Commission for the Middle East in its
capital city, Manama. This Regional Commission has 20 Member Countries and
is one of the 5 Regional Commissions of the OIE. The Director General of
the OIE, Dr Bernard Vallat, the OIE Regional Representative for the Middle
East, Dr Ghazi Yehia, Delegates of Member Countries of the OIE,
representatives of international and regional organisations and observers
also attended the Conference.
Speaking on the current threat of a potential human flu pandemic, Dr Vallat
commented "I would like to reiterate my previous assertions that the best
way to prevent the pandemic is to reduce or eliminate the virus from the
animal source and in this respect, the OIE has provided Member countries
with the necessary tools and/or advice to achieve that goal". He explained
that the OIE has through its world-wide network of Reference Laboratories
and experts provided Member Countries with AI surveillance guidelines,
standards to continue trade of poultry and poultry products, a choice of
vaccines that can be applied and a joint OIE/FAO forum for the exchange of
scientific information and virus strains which may be used for the
manufacture of human vaccines. He also announced that the OIE is leading a
high-level delegation of world-renowned experts comprising epidemiologists,
laboratory specialists and ornithologists to proceed to Siberia in order to
investigate whether these birds are really carriers of the virus and
whether they can carry the virus over long distances and, if so, when and
where they can present disease risks.
Dr Vallat also addressed a special message to politicians and other
policy-makers urging them to consider strengthening of the veterinary
service as an 'International Public Good' and to ensure that adequate
resources are provided to veterinary services to enable them to develop a
rapid and early warning and response system with respect to disease
incursions. He stressed "investment in animal health through Veterinary
Services should be considered as a priority for its role in more
effectively controlling animal diseases, in protecting public health and in
improving regional and international market access for the benefit of the
Middle East region and the international community as a whole".
