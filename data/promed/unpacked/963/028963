- Sat 15 Aug 2020. Ebola outbreak: New cases reported in Lotumbe and Monieka health zones
[Outbreak News Today, abridged, edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/ebola-outbreak-new-cases-reported-in-lotumbe-and-monieka-health-zones-88848/

Officials with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported (computer translated) 2 new confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) on 13 Aug [2020] in the health zones of Lotumbe and Monieka in Equateur province, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

This brings the outbreak total to 88 cases reported (including 84 confirmed and 4 probable), and the death toll remains at 36. The number of health zones affected by the outbreak is now up to 10.

The current EVD outbreak, the country's 11th, began at the beginning of June 2020.

[There is a gradual increase of cases as noted in this report, as well as gradual spread to new health zones. While case numbers seem low, this situation is very dangerous and could explode at any time. It is very difficult to completely eliminate a virus that is being transmitted in the community unless there is massive vaccination. The additional health problems in the DRC -- measles, malaria, COVID-19 -- as well as the poor health infrastructure and cost make such a vaccination effort difficult. - Mod.LK]

Tests confirmed 2 more Ebola infections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Equateur province outbreak, raising the total to 86 [now 88, see above], the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said today [14 Aug 2020] on Twitter.

No new deaths were reported, keeping the total at 36.

At a WHO media briefing on COVID-19 yesterday [13 Aug 2020], WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said the DRC and its partners face significant logistical challenges in investigating and establishing response capacities in extremely remote and hard-to-access areas. The outbreak's geographic spread is vast, and some areas can be accessed only by helicopter or boat.

Tedros added that the WHO has about 100 staff on the ground who are working with the DRC health ministry, other United Nations agencies, and other groups. So far, the WHO has released USD 2.5 million from its contingency fund, but it needs more funding to bring the outbreak under control and end it.

The outbreak began in early June [2020], marking the DRC's 11th involving Ebola. It is occurring in the same region as a short-lived outbreak in 2018 that affected at least 54 people, 33 of them fatally.

- Thu 13 Aug 2020. Ebola cases in western DR Congo rise to 84 in latest outbreak
[CGTN Africa, edited]
https://africa.cgtn.com/2020/08/13/ebola-cases-in-western-dr-congo-rise-to-84-in-latest-outbreak/

The number of Ebola cases in the latest outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo's Equateur Province currently stands at 84, according to the World Health Organisation.

The outbreak, announced in June [2020] in Mbandaka in Equateur Province, now has 80 confirmed cases and 4 probable cases. A total of 36 people have been killed by the deadly virus while 37 others have recovered, according to data from the WHO.

More than 12 000 people have been vaccinated since the outbreak, the 11th one in the DR Congo, was announced.

The United States, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), pledged more than USD 7.5 million in additional humanitarian assistance to help end the outbreak. The assistance will include support for the deployment of rapid-response teams to remote areas, surveillance for cases of the disease, and treatment facilities, in addition to helping survivors facing stigmatization.

Nearly 2 months ago, Congolese authorities declared the 10th Ebola outbreak in the country's northeastern region in Ituri and North Kivu provinces officially over.

The DR Congo's health authorities are battling a number of diseases in addition to Ebola, including cholera, measles, and COVID-19.

#Ebola: 5 new cases yesterday in the Equateur outbreak in DRC. That's a lot, especially as they are spread over 3 different health areas. This outbreak doesn't seem to be going well, though there's very little information coming out about it. Totals: 84 cases & 36 deaths (up 3).

- Sun 9 Aug 2020. Ebola update: 3 additional cases, USD 7.5 million additional humanitarian aid
[Outbreak News Today, abridged, edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/ebola-update-3-additional-cases-7.5-million-in-additional-humanitarian-aid-16593/

Three additional Ebola virus disease cases were reported in Equateur Province, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), bringing the outbreak total to 77 total (73 confirmed, 4 probable). An additional death was recorded, bringing the total to 33.

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) announced Friday [7 Aug 2020] more than USD 7.5 million in additional humanitarian assistance to help end the 11th Ebola outbreak in the country.

The funding also will support Ebola survivors and maintain a rapid-response capacity in eastern DRC, where the DRC's 10th outbreak, the 2nd-largest outbreak of the disease in history, was declared over in June 2020.

Through USAID's NGO and UN partners on the ground, the United States is scaling up to providing life-saving assistance in northwestern DRC's Equateur Province, where a new outbreak of Ebola was declared on 1 Jun [2020].

This assistance includes support for the deployment of rapid-response teams to remote areas, surveillance for cases of the disease, and treatment facilities. Additionally, this assistance will help survivors facing stigmatization, as well as fund continued engagement with communities on prevention and post-outbreak training on safe and dignified burials.
