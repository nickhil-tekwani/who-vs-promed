The Ministry of Agriculture will be taking steps to counter the purple blotch disease wreaking havoc on scallion [spring onion] production in sections of Manchester and St Elizabeth [parishes].

Some farmers say they have lost some crops due to the disease. Agriculture Minister Audley Shaw said his Ministry will quickly deal with the situation so it does not worsen.

[Purple blotch of onions (_Allium cepa_) and related crops, such as leek (_A. porrum_) and garlic (_A. sativum_), is caused by the fungus _Alternaria porri_. Crop losses depend on environmental conditions and may range from 25 to 90 per cent. The damage may continue to develop post-harvest. Symptoms on onion include small, water-soaked lesions with purple centres on leaves, leaf bases, and flower stalks, which expand and result in necrotic patches; symptoms may be confused with stemphylium blight of onion (_Stemphylium vesicarium_; see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). On leek, _A. porri_ leads to white or purple spots appearing on leaves; affected leaves crack and eventually die.

The disease is favoured by high humidity and often occurs as a secondary infection on plants already affected by other pathogens or pests (for example, onion thrips). The pathogen is mostly spread with infected plant material and by mechanical means (including insects and human activities). Disease management may include fungicides, clean planting material, phytosanitation to minimise inoculum and crop rotation.

Other species in the genus cause, for example, early blight of potato and tomato (_A. solani_) and leaf blight of tea (_A. alternata_).
