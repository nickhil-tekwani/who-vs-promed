---------------------------------------------------------------------------
From 2005 to 2007 in Southern Wielkopolska, Lower Silesia, and
Malopolska regions, maize (_Zea mays_) plants showing leaf mosaic and
stunting symptoms were found. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay) tests using commercial polyclonal antisera against _Maize
dwarf mosaic virus_ (MDMV) gave positive results in 71 samples.
However, the ELISA response for symptomatic plants, in most cases,
was low. Therefore, only 8 plants with relatively high virus
concentration were chosen for further identification assays.

Examination of leaf extracts with an electron microscope revealed the
presence of potyvirus-like particles. Symptomatic leaves were
positive for MDMV by using immunosorbent electron microscopy (ISEM)
with antiserum raised against the Spanish isolate of MDMV used as
positive control. A set of test plants, including sweet corn, dent
corn, sorghum (_Sorghum vulgare_), and true millet (_Panicum
miliaceum_), were mechanically inoculated with extracts from
symptomatic plants. Inoculated plants developed symptoms typical of
MDMV in 2 to 5 weeks.

For further investigations, 3 virus isolates were chosen. To confirm
the identification of MDMV, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR
(polymerase chain reaction) was performed with total RNA isolated
from infected plants. The RT-PCR products obtained were analyzed by
agarose gel electrophoresis. Amplicons of the expected sizes (635 and
560 bp) were obtained with RNA from symptomatic plants, but not from
asymptomatic plants. The highest nucleotide sequence identities were
99 percent with 3 Spanish MDMV isolates, 91 percent with the
Hungarian isolate "Sc/H, sweet corn", 90 percent with "MDMV-A"
U07216, and 87 percent with an Israeli MDMV. On the basis of these
findings, the virus isolated from diseased maize plants was
identified as MDMV. The significance of MDMV detection is noteworthy
because maize has become an important crop in Poland in recent years
and acreage is increasing systematically.

[_Maize dwarf mosaic virus_ (MDMV, genus _Potyvirus_) affects maize,
sorghum, millets, and several grass species. Symptoms may vary
according to hosts and environmental conditions, but generally
include leaf mosaic or streaks, leaf discolourations, stunting of
plants, excessive tillering, and low seed set. In maize, early
infection can lead to root and stalk rots and plant death. Infection
sites in the field are often sporadic and may be individual plants,
clusters, or rows along the edge of the field (often close to grasses
serving as virus reservoirs). Several strains of MDMV exist denoted
as A to F and possibly additional ones. The virus is spread by
several species of aphid vectors in a non-persistent manner and may
also be transmitted by mechanical means and seed. MDMV survives
between seasons in rhizomes of some host species. Disease management
includes use of resistant crop varieties and control of virus
reservoirs.
