[1] Dysentery, amoebic - Uganda (northeast)

Two more people in Agago district have died of [amoebic] dysentery.
This brings the number of people who have died of the disease since
the outbreak begun in October 2010 to 15. 3 other people have been
quarantined at Kalongo after presenting symptoms of the disease.

The district health officer, Dr Emmanuel Otto, said the 2 people, who
had been quarantined at Dr Ambrossoli Hospital in Kalongo town
council, died over the weekend [20-21 Nov 2010]. "All the 5 victims
are from Paimol sub-county, which borders Abim district," Otto said.

Last week [week of 15 Nov 2010], 13 people died of the disease, 5
from Paimol and Omiya P'Chua sub-counties in Agago district and 8
from the neighbouring Abim district, where the disease is said to
have originated.

The health ministry spokesman, Paul Kaggwa, recently said preliminary
laboratory tests revealed that the disease was [amoebic] dysentery.

[2] Cholera - Chad
Date: Mon 29 Nov 2010

In the village of Tchinfogo in southern Chad, men and women
repeatedly sprint along a dirt path, their tears mixing with sweat as
they wail. They go for about 30 m before running back and lying on
the tomb of a woman who days earlier, at the age of 28, died of cholera.

It is a mourning ritual of the Massa ethnic group, predominant in
this part of Chad, Tchinfogo residents told IRIN. Normally, they
said, people would also throw themselves onto the body, often hugging
and kissing it. But amid a cholera outbreak that as of 24 Nov 2010
had killed 166 people and infected 5787 across Chad, communities have
had to alter their mourning rites.

Government health agents and aid workers working round the clock to
treat cholera patients and educate people on how to prevent the
disease (left untreated it can kill within hours) must contend with
people's desire to visit and touch ailing loved ones, or the bodies
of those who have died.

[3] Diarrhea - Honduras

Cases of diarrhea in children under 15 have increased by 279 cases
during epidemiological week number 45 [7-13 Nov 2010], with higher
incidence in Choloma, Puerto Cortes, Villanueva, and Omoa.

Delia Tercero, the Regional Department of Health epidemiologist,
reported that 87 patients were older than 15 years old, so that (the
department) began an investigation, to determine what accounted for
this increase. "Most cases are in minors, and are allegedly caused by
bad food handling or improper storage of the same. Housewives, or
those who prepare food, are urged to keep a strict control of hygiene
when cooking."

Tercero indicated that if the percentage of cases in adults increases
investigations will be undertaken to confirm if the diarrhea is due
to poisoning through contaminated food or the water supply.

[4] Diarrhea - Mexico (Tampico)

Due to the continued spread of cholera cases in Haiti, the appearance
of some patients in the USA, and the risk that a case could enter and
pass through Tamaulipas Mexico, officials of Sanitary District Number
Two in Tampico, in conjunction with the State Commission for
Protection Against Health Risks (Coepris), are monitoring this
epidemiological situation closely.

The head of Sanitary District Number 2, Sergio Camargo Uriegas, said
samples have been taken of the more serious cases of diarrhea, so far
1500 samples and they are constantly analyzing clean water and sewer
water through Moore swabs every 15 days to verify if cholera is present.

Camargo Uriegas said 670 cases of diarrhea are recorded weekly but
there is concern for problems related to cholera, so they ask the
public that if anyone is evacuating up to 5 times daily for more than
5 days, to consult the Health Center because it could be cholera.

[5] Cholera - Papua New Guinea (Western province)
Date: Fri 26 Nov 2010

<http://www.theage.com.au/national/cholera-outbreak-spreads-to-png-20101125=-1895s.html>


An outbreak of cholera in the Torres Strait has spread to scores of
island and coastal villages in the Fly River delta area of Papua New
Guinea's [PNG] Western Province, killing more than 100 people and
infecting hundreds of others.

The disease had already killed 32 people and infected 888 others on
Daru, the most highly populated island in the Torres Strait. Many of
the victims are children.

Ian Kemish, Australia's high commissioner in Port Moresby, told The
Age the new outbreak is much harder to handle than on Daru because it
is in remote areas where there is poor communication, difficult
travel conditions, and widely dispersed villages.

Mr Kemish, who led a delegation of foreign officials to Daru island,
said the situation among the 21 000 population there was now
"relatively stable".

"There have been 2 deaths on the island since last week compared to 2
or 3 deaths a day when the disease broke out," he said.

Australia closed the Torres Strait border with PNG 3 weeks ago as a
precaution against the spread of the disease into Queensland. Since
10 Nov 2010, 314 PNG nationals who traveled across the border into
Australian territory have been turned back. Normally, traditional
visits to Australia by indigenous inhabitants are allowed under
free-movement provisions of the Torres Strait Treaty. The latest
restrictions do not apply to other travelers, including those holding
passports and visas.

Australian officials say the restriction will remain in place until
further notice, but will be subject to ongoing review. They say the
border was closed in consultation with PNG authorities in Daru, which
is 4 km [2.5 mi] from the PNG mainland and 50 km [31 mi] from the
nearest Australian island.
