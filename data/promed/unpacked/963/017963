At least 12 people have died in Meru North district in the past 2 months
after eating contaminated maize.
As a result, more than 17 200 tons of grain worth Sh68 million believed to
be contaminated will be destroyed.
Dr Dietmar Ziegler, the medical superintendent at Maua Mission Hospital,
said the dead were among 24 patients who had been admitted to the hospital
since last August after eating the maize. They had liver complications,
which he attributed to aflatoxin, a toxic chemical [mycotoxin produced by
fungi due to poor grain storage. Dr Ziegler said the patients had initially
shown symptoms of Hepatitis B.
He said results of blood samples taken to the Kenya Medical Research
Institute indicated they contained aflatoxin, a fungal substance which
causes liver inflammation.
He said those visiting the hospital with similar symptoms complained of
high fever, headache and abdominal pains.
The district public health officer, Mr Robert Kitulya, confirmed 40 percent
of maize harvested during the last season from Ndoleli, Tigania East,
Igembe South and Uringo was contaminated. Mr Kitulya said the contaminated
maize was being sold in the local market and warned consumers and farmers
against buying it. He announced the launch of a 2-week joint education
campaign by agricultural and public health officers to sensitize farmers
and consumers on how to identify the contaminated grain.
Mr Kitulya said the contaminated grain had mold or fungus stains and a
bitter taste when cooked. He attributed the contamination to poorly
ventilated storage facilities, adding some farmers stored their maize in
plastic containers which retained moisture.
The officer said some tobacco farmers in the affected areas did not know
how to use and safely handle chemicals. Half of the maize samples collected
from food kiosks and some local markets and which were tested by government
chemists had aflatoxin. Mr Kitulya said 8 of the 16 samples taken for tests
were contaminated. The tests followed an alarm raised by health
institutions in the district after receiving numerous patients suspected to
have consumed the grain.

Poisoned Maize Destroyed in Kenya
---------------------------------
Kenya's public health officers have seized and destroyed more than 13 230
kg [of contaminated maize in the Meru District of Central Province the
Daily Nation newspaper reported on Friday. The area public health officer,
Robert Kitulya said that [maize was seized from local markets from where
45 more samples were collected and taken to the government chemist for
further tests.
In the past 2 months, 12 people have died while 12 others [were treated at
a local hospital after consuming maize contaminated with aflatoxin. Kitulya
said a high percentage of the maize harvested in the area could be
contaminated with aflatoxin, a toxic chemical produced by fungi due to poor
grain storage.
"The situation could be worse and we are advising consumers, especially in
the rural areas, to be extra-cautious when buying maize grain or maize meal
even from shops," he said.
Agricultural and public heath officers were also targeting hawkers selling
maize in open-air markets and food kiosks, and advised people to inform his
office of any grain or maize products suspected to be contaminated.
Though only maize in some divisions was affected, the education campaign by
agricultural officers would cover the whole district, he said, calling on
farmers to avoid storing strong agro-chemicals or veterinary drugs in food
[storage areas.

[Aflatoxin is one of several mycotoxins produced by different fungi during
development of grain seeds and when grain is stored under conditions of
high moisture and temperature. The authorities acted quickly and appear to
have contained the contaminated seed. What is worrisome is other people may
still be at risk if contaminated grain has been distributed to unsuspecting
people in the normal course of daily life.
Kenyan authorities are to be commended for the education program and for
emphasizing food stuffs must never be stored in areas containing pesticides
and veterinary drugs.
For the first report of this poisoning, see the following URL:

For a follow-up, see the following URL which documents the fatal poisoning
of a family of 4 who died following consumption of food contaminated with
tobacco pesticides:

[Levels of aflatoxin must have been very high to have resulted in death
within 2 months. Typically aflatoxin affects the liver. Most treatments
consist of removing the contaminated grain/products from consumption and
providing supportive care. Aflatoxin will clear the body fairly rapidly
once the source is removed. - Mod.TG
