UNDIAGNOSED DISEASE, PORCINE - CHINA (08): REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Beijing's 1st report on the scale of an outbreak that has disrupted the pig
industry and caused pork prices to soar, said a contagious pig disease
killed 18 000 in the 1st 5 months of 2007.
A report on the agriculture ministry website (<http://www.agri.gov.cn>, in
Chinese), said the blue ear disease outbreak had infected 45 000 pigs
through May [2006], of which 18 000 had died. It was the 1st official
assessment since an outbreak of the disease a year ago [2006] killed what
feed industry officials estimate at as many as one million pigs.
The ministry did not say how many pigs had died last year [2006], but noted
the highly contagious disease had "caused heavy losses to the pig breeding
industry".
The widespread disease has partly contributed to the soaring domestic pork
prices -- and has put pressure on national inflation levels -- prompting
Premier Wen Jiabao to visit a pig farm last month [May 2007], where he
pledged to ensure meat supplies for the poor.
The disease, caused by a variation of porcine reproductive and respiratory
syndrome (PRRS) virus, was still being found among pigs in some provinces,
according to the ministry. It did not elaborate.
The ministry urged all local governments to boost vaccination efforts and
to take more preventive measures to stop the spread of the disease.
In a separate report, the agriculture minister, Sun Zhengcai, toured the
northern province of Shandong and urged local governments to encourage
farmers to raise more pigs. "Hog production and supply not only relate to
the people's life and farmers' income, but a situation as a whole," Sun was
quoted as saying in a report posted on the ministry website.
Since the outbreak, many farmers have been unwilling to breed more pigs for
fear of losing money because of the high mortality rate from the disease
and because of high feed prices.

ProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall
[China reported to the OIE (Office Internation des Epizooties; World
Organization for Animal Health) earlier this year (2007), a single outbreak
of PRRS, in the village of Laosi, Guandong Province, starting on 23 Apr
2007, confirmed and reported on 9 May 2007. The report mentioned an
apparent morbidity rate of 55 per cent and a fatality rate of 20 per cent.
See details at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5387>.
The current, apparently official, publication speaks about a "widespread"
disease "in some provinces". It mentions figures which represent a case
fatality rate of 40 per cent while no data related to the morbidity rate
are disclosed. The number of infected (45 000) and dead (18 000) pigs are
significantly lower than figures cited in previous, unofficial
communications on the so-called "swine high fever disease" (SHFD), of which
PRRS was regarded to be one of several contributing causal factors.
According to the unofficial data, SHFD has been spreading since 2006 within
at least 10 provinces, with death figures mounting to the millions, causing
heavy economic losses.
The flood of newswires, originating from various (official, semi-official,
unofficial, central, provincial, and foreign) sources, with contradictory
pieces of information on SHFD, its etiology and distribution, could be put
on hold if/when detailed, 1st hand, authoritative results of laboratory
investigations from all affected provinces become available, pertaining to
the entire range of potential causal agents and preferably officially
submitted to the OIE.
A request for information on the described, so far undiagnosed porcine
syndrome spreading in China, was already posted by ProMED-mail on 30 May
2007; the request is hereby repeated. It would also be interesting to note
which vaccine is the one recommended for use by the Chinese authorities;
several modified-live virus (MLV) and killed virus PRRS vaccines are in use
in the USA and Europe. - Mod.AS]
