Date palm farmers must watch out for black scorch, which is spreading in Oman. Delay in eliminating the disease may lead to hotspots, spread to other trees, and death of palms. Farmers should pay attention to irrigation, fertilisers, weed control, and cleanliness of the plantings. They also need to monitor the palms on an ongoing basis. Farmers are asked to cooperate in combating the disease.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Water Resources advises a combination of different fungicides in the recommended doses. Crown and trunk must be sprayed with the same solution. Spraying should be repeated after 2 to 3 weeks. Affected fronds should be cut and burnt, surrounding tissues sprayed with lime-sulphur solution or copper-based fungicides. Severely affected palms are to be removed and burnt.

[Black scorch of date palm (_Phoenix dactylifera_) is caused by the fungi _Thielaviopsis radicicola_ and _Ceratocystis paradoxa_, either alone or as coinfection. The disease has been reported in all date growing areas worldwide and in many date varieties. The pathogens cause a range of symptoms on the host, which has led to other disease names such as bud rot, bending head, crazy disease (Medjnoon), inflorescence blight, trunk rot, stem bending, dry basal rot and heart rot. Symptoms mostly include dark lesions on leaves, necrosis of affected tissues, as well as black discolouration ("scorch") of fronds and fruit stands. If, in severe cases, the terminal bud is affected, the palm most likely dies. Occasionally, palms have been reported to have recovered, showing a characteristic bend in the region of infection which reduces fruit production for years. External stress factors are thought to increase host sensitivity to infection.

Not much appears to be known about the epidemiology of the black scorch fungi. Other species in the genera can be soil borne; spread may also occur by water, mechanical means (for example on cutting tools) and with plant material. Beetles have been reported as important vectors in some hosts. Disease management for black scorch may include orchard sanitation (burning of infected plant matter or whole palms), disinfection of cutting tools and wounds resulting from harvesting or frond pruning, as well as sprays of copper-based fungicides.

_T. radicicola_ can also affect other hosts causing, for example, fruit rot of citrus. _C. paradoxa_ may cause stem bleeding disease of coconut palm after infecting wounds in the trunk.
