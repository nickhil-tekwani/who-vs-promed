A strain of bovine tuberculosis that's new to the United States [see ProMED-mail post 20170318.4910416] has been discovered in a Harding County cattle herd and state officials are taking big steps to prevent its spread.

The infection is the 1st time since 2011 bovine TB has been found in a South Dakota cattle herd.

The investigation has been ongoing since February [2017]. A total of 41 animals were found to be infected with the disease. Thirteen neighboring ranches were quarantined in an effort to prevent the disease from spreading. So far 6 of those ranches have been released [from the quarantine]. The remaining 7 still have testing to complete, state agriculture officials say.

A total of 3 cattle were identified at 2 Nebraska slaughtering facilities during a routine USDA inspection in February [2017]. They had been in 3 separate feedlots in Nebraska and South Dakota since November 2016.

The National Veterinary Services Laboratory [NVSL] in Ames, Iowa identified a strain of _Mycobacterium bovis_, [as the causative agent] nearly identical to a strain previously only seen in central Mexican dairy cattle.

State Veterinarian Dustin Oedekoven said there is much speculation, and at least 2 possibilities, as to how that specific strain entered South Dakota.

"One, it came with cattle. A million to a million and a half cattle are imported from Mexico to here. They're all tested and inspected for animal health issues. We also have additional test requirements if they enter from Mexico into South Dakota. We don't know if these cattle are of Mexican origin. It's a possibility, but it's a long shot," Oedekoven said.

He said the other possibility is that it was brought in by people. Bovine tuberculosis can infect humans, Oedekoven said. "Both those possibilities are difficult to prove at this point. We don't know how this herd was infected at this time," he said.

As to if the TB-free status would be revoked from South Dakota, Oedekoven said it depends on how and if this tuberculosis strain spreads.

"At this point, our staff at the Animal Industry Board and USDA Vet Services are working with producers in this state, and other states where cattle may be related to this herd. We're assessing the spread of this disease."

An initial herd test was done to determine if the cattle contracted TB. All animals that tested positive on the initial herd test were removed from the herd and the remaining tested negative.

The cattle testing negative for the disease at this point does not mean they aren't infected with TB. The test shows which animals in the herd are infected, but it also has a known false negative rate, Oedekoven said, so there could be more infected animals.

Oedekoven said the way the Animal Industry Board would like to handle the herd is by depopulating it or moving the animals to slaughter. The ranchers who own the cattle will be paid by the USDA for the loss of their animals, Oedekoven said. The state currently is awaiting approval for that step.

As far as wildlife are concerned, harvesting animals to test for tuberculosis is still in progress. Deer and pronghorn antelope in a 3-mile radius of the infected herd will be harvested said Mike Kintigh, South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks (GF and P) regional supervisor for Region I. Traps for possums, raccoons and badgers also were set on the ranch with the infected herd.

"We've been advised that coyotes are a pretty good indicator species of how far the disease had spread if it's in wildlife," Kintigh said. For coyotes, there are 2 [depopulation] radius circles around the ranch; one at 10 miles and another at 20 miles.

Kintigh said there are no direct links to wildlife yet. "That's what we're doing this work for -- to see if it's there."

Harvesting wildlife either happens on the ground or by air from a helicopter. The goals were to harvest 50 antelope, 100 whitetail and mule deer, and an open number of coyotes.

The animals, older than 1 year, are targeted, picked up and carried to a lab in their entirety. The [deceased] big game animals are hung [on the rack] before being processed. Then their lymph nodes are removed from the head, near the heart, and other locations. A federal veterinarian looks at the heart and lungs for signs of external lesions. Once the organs are inspected, the veterinarian will look at the chest walls for abnormalities. Six to 8 samples come from each animal, Kintigh said.

Kintigh said GF and P staff had almost reached their goal on antelope and deer and could finish testing on those animals by Thu 30 March 2017.

[Bovine TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph node enlargement may also be present.

There is also a nationwide surveillance program in slaughter plants. If lesions consistent with TB appear on a carcass, a sample is sent to APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) for confirmation. The state officials will likely be tracing the movements of animals into and out of this herd in an effort to find the originating herd or herds.

We will be interested to see how this investigation develops and if any wildlife has the disease. This article mentioned the possibility of the disease being transmitted from people, but it does not indicate if authorities will ask any of the owners and workers at these facilities to be tested for this strain of TB. - Mod.TG
