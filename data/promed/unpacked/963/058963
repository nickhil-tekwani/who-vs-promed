MANAGEMENT OF A CLUSTER OF CASES OF INVASIVE GROUP C NEISSERIA MENINGITIDIS
INFECTIONS IN THE HAMILTON-WENTWORTH REGION Â– ONTARIO
Introduction
The Canadian Laboratory Centre for Disease Control (LCDC) held a Canadian
Consensus Conference in February 1993 on meningococcal disease.
Subsequently, the Advisory Committee on Epidemiology (ACE) revised its
guidelines for the management of clustered cases of meningococcal disease
to reflect the recommendations of the consensus conference.
Invasive meningococcal disease continues to be a source of public concern
in communities across Canada. Of the 13 serogroups, groups A, B, C, Y, and
W-135 are the most common. The incidence of disease is cyclical in nature,
increasing in late winter and early spring in Canada. In 1985, 46% of
isolates grouped were serogroup B and 24% were serogroup C. In 1992, 24%
were serogroup B and 56% were serogroup C. In addition, beginning in 1989,
the incidence of serogroup C in the age group 5 to 19 years old has more
than doubled. Outbreaks of serogroup C meningococcal disease have been
occurring more frequently since the early 1990s and the use of
meningococcal vaccine to control these outbreaks has also increased.
ACE recommends the administration of chemoprophylactic antimicrobials to
all close contacts of a sporadic case of meningococcal disease but not to
school contacts, transportation and workplace contacts, nor social contacts
who are not close. In addition, where evidence suggests that an outbreak is
occurring or where there is a cluster of cases in a delineated population
caused by a vaccine-preventable serogroup, vaccination of all persons at
risk should be considered. When two cases of the same vaccine- preventable
serogroup occur in the same school within one month, one should immunize
vaccine-eligible students attending the entire school.
This paper describes the application of the 1994 guidelines for the control
of meningococcal disease in a school community in the Hamilton-Wentworth
region in 1996, and presents a framework to assist in the management of a
cluster of invasive group C infection in a school...
Discussion:
Follow-up investigation to obtain important epidemiologic information along
with timely and accurate results of all laboratory testing cannot be
undervalued in a potential outbreak situation. Initially, Case 1 was not
considered part of the school-based cluster because of the 4-week time
interval between Cases 1 and 2. However, all three cases were serogroup C,
lived in the same geographic area, and were in the same age group. This
information strengthened the decision to coordinate a school-based
immunization program.
The final laboratory results, received 16 November 1996, showed that all
three cases had similar phenotype with the same electrophoretic type (ET)
and grouped into similar genetically related ET complexes. Therefore, even
though the investigations found no apparent connection between the three
students, the final results showed that a similar strain of meningococcal
disease was circulating in the community.
The cost of the immunization program was approximately $43,740.00, based on
average hourly rates for the staff and excluding vaccine costs and supplies.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, planning and implementing this urgent program was made
possible by the essential and important community partnerships already in
place with the local hospitals, physicians, and the school. In addition,
the collaborative consultation with the Public Health Branch in the
interpretation and application of the revised ACE guidelines was an
integral part in the management and prevention of an outbreak of
meningococcal disease.
