On [17 May 2020] at about 4:00 pm, Xicheng [Beijing] District Disease Control Center received reports from the fever clinic of a medical institution of multiple fever occurrences at No. 55 Fuxingmen Inner Street in Xicheng District [the headquarters of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China]. A total of 33 patients from this site were seen at the clinic. Nucleic acid tests for novel coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] were all negative. Respiratory pathogen multiplex testing found that many were positive for group A _Streptococcus_ [_Streptococcus pyogenes_]. COVID-19 pneumonia has been ruled out. Many patients said that their fevers were related to the recent use of central air conditioning. It has been preliminarily concluded that the fevers were caused by exposure to a common factor. The pathogen has preliminarily been determined to be group A _Streptococcus_.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dan Silver for contributing and translating the news report above.

The information available from the report is limited. We are told that 33 workers at an office building were seen at a "fever" clinic. Other than fever, we are not told their symptoms; presumably, they had respiratory symptoms, because respiratory pathogen multiplex testing was done; but, for example, did they have a sore throat? Tests were positive for group A streptococci (GAS) in "many", but we are not told how many of the 33 patients were positive for GAS. Tests for SARS-CoV-2 were all negative.

The respiratory pathogens multiplex panel tests for the presence of multiple viral and bacterial microbes in a single respiratory sample. Respiratory viral pathogens frequently included in these panels are influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus (serotypes HKU1, NL63, 229E, OC43), and adenovirus, but we are not told the results of these tests. In addition, we are not told if these office workers experienced anything in common, that is work in the same office, eat together, or in any other way have epidemiological links other than working in the same office building?

Outbreaks of GAS infections have previously been reported among school-aged children, in hospitals, in long-term care facilities, and in military training centers. GAS are spread between people who are in close contact with one another by contact with nose and throat discharges of an infected individual or with infected skin lesions. The risk of spread is greatest when an individual is ill, such as when people have strep throat or an infected wound. Individuals who carry the bacteria but have no symptoms are much less contagious. In addition to person-to-person transmission, GAS can also be transmitted by consumption of foods by infected food handlers. Examples of foodborne outbreaks of GAS pharyngitis include the following: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16126564/, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23868521/, and https://jcm.asm.org/content/56/5/e01884-17.

M protein is the major virulence factor of GAS and GAS are divided into serotypes based on the antigenic differences in the M protein molecule. More recently, GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the _emm_ gene that encodes M serospecificity (http://medbox.iiab.me/modules/en-cdc/www.cdc.gov/streplab/m-proteingene-typing.html).

The news report above does not specify the M protein type(s) involved in the Beijing outbreak. Molecular typing of isolates may aid in documenting whether this outbreak is caused by a common strain, which would suggest a common source, or if multiple different strains are involved. _emm_ typing may lack the discriminatory power to confirm a common source outbreak. Other molecular techniques to further characterize outbreak strains include pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of chromosomal DNA fragments, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), detection of exotoxin-encoding genes, and whole genome sequencing.

More information from knowledgeable sources on this outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
