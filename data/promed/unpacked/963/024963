[This outbreak, like the one in May 2020, involves sheep, but this one also includes cattle.

Anthrax is a zoonotic disease that represents a threat to human and veterinary health in many parts of the world. Control of anthrax depends on several factors, including proper management of outbreaks and livestock vaccination, which have been implemented. Proper disposal of the infected animals is also key to controlling and limiting the disease. - Mod.TG
