[1] Johnson & Johnson vaccine
Date: Fri 23 Apr 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/04/acip-opts-lift-pause-johnson-johnson-vaccine


Today [Fri 23 Apr 2021] the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the independent group of experts that advises the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), recommended that the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine be reinstated in the Unites States' vaccination campaign in a 10 to 4 vote. One member abstained from voting because of a conflict of interest.

This ends a 10-day pause on use of the vaccine. The pause began after rare blood clots, called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), were detected in a handful of patients in the weeks following vaccination.

At the time of the pause, the Johnsons & Johnson vaccine made up only 5% of immunizations given in the United States but has been considered an important tool in reaching patient populations that would benefit from the single-dose COVID-19 vaccine.

CDC: 15 TTS cases, 3 deaths
----------------------------
ACIP members heard from Tom Shimabukuro, MD, MPH, MBA, the deputy director of the Immunization Safety Office at the CDC, who shared that the agency had detected a total of 15 TTS cases, including 3 fatalities, up from 6 when the pause was first instated. The cases had been detected using the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

"TTS is rare but clinically serious and potentially life threatening, and a potentially life-threatening adverse event that has been observed in association with the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine," Shimabukuro said.

All 15 of the cases were women, and all but 2 were under the age of 50. Seven of the 16 [sic] cases were in women ages 30-39. As of 21 Apr [2021], the CDC was investigating less than 10 additional possible cases, Shimabukuro said.

Seven of the 15 cases were in obese women, and 2 women were taking oral contraceptives. None had blood clotting disorders. Of the 15 cases, 3 women died, 5 were recovered or recovering at home, and 7 remained hospitalized, including 4 in the intensive care unit. All women experienced symptom onset no sooner than 6 days post-vaccination, but no later than day 15, and all reported headache, fatigue, and abdominal pain.

Using the data that's been collected, Shimabukuro said the risk of TTS from the J&J vaccine would be 7 TTS cases per 1 million doses administered to women ages 18-49. The risk for women older than 50 would be 0.9 per 1 million doses.

Shimabukuro said no TTS has been documented in recipients of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, the 2 mRNA vaccines authorized for COVID-19 in the United States.

ACIP weighed benefits of vaccine against risks
----------------------------------------
During the meeting, J&J officials reminded listeners that the vaccine had been tested in South America and South Africa and was highly effective in protecting against severe disease despite the presence of circulating variant strains in those locations.

None of the officials from J&J denied the link between their single-dose adenovirus-based vaccine and TTS, but emphasized that their vaccine played a necessary role in controlling the pandemic at home and abroad.

"Our vaccine offers a high level of protection against variants, and the benefits of single-dose regimen cannot be overstated," said Mathai Mammen, MD, PhD, the Global Head of Janssen Research and Development.

In the United States, the J&J vaccine was 85% effective in preventing symptomatic illness in clinical trials, and 100% effective in preventing death.

Various ACIP members raised the point that in the United States, adults have the choice of J&J or the mRNA vaccines, which are also effective and have an extensive safety track record. They also voiced concerns that reinstating the J&J vaccine would add to vaccine hesitancy.

Those who were in favor of lifting the pause said the 10-day window had allowed clinicians to understand the threat of TTS and improve clinical outcomes in patients. They also cautioned that most vaccination sites do not offer a choice of vaccines, but rather have one option for adult recipients.

In the end, the group decided to fully recommend the vaccine for use in all adults over the age of 18. Those who voted against lifting the pause argued the vaccine should contain patient warning language for women under the age of 50.

J&J said the company had agreed on warning language with the FDA, which will say the vaccine has, in rare instances, caused TSS in women under the age of 50.

Now that the motion has passed to go forward with administration of the J&J vaccine, it is important that everyone is well informed before accepting it, particularly women under the age of 50. But the vaccine is now recommended for persons 18 years of age and older in the US population under the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization. - Mod.LK]

[2] AstraZeneca

[2a] Adverse effects and age

UK government scientific advisers are split on whether to recommend that all under-40s should be offered an alternative to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, as cases of the rare blood-clotting condition linked to it continue to rise.

The move followed growing evidence that the shot could trigger a blood disorder in extremely rare cases and an assessment of the risk it posed in various age groups compared with the benefits.

A study by the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge University released at the time showed that only for those adults under 30 were the risks posed by COVID-19 and the jab comparable, depending on infection rates.

The JCVI [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation] is now debating whether the same advice to offer an alternative to the AstraZeneca jab, if possible, should be extended to the healthy cohort under 40, when the mass vaccination programme begins for them next month [May 2021].

The JCVI is expected to make a decision as early as next week, according to one of its members, but is waiting for more data, including the analysis of blood samples from some of those affected by the blood disorder.

"I would for sure support giving people who are 30-40 another vaccine," said Maarten Postma, professor in pharmacoeconomics at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, and a member of the JCVI. "There are alternative [vaccines], so we can be careful."

The latest data from the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency on Thursday [22 Apr 2021] showed 68 new cases of the blood disorder in people who had received the AstraZeneca shot were reported in the last week.

The clotting condition has led to 32 deaths in 168 affected people aged between 18 and 93 in the UK with 21.2m doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine administered so far. One case was reported in an individual following their 2nd shot of the vaccine.

Postma added that the overall risk-benefit balance for all ages was clearly in favour of continued use of the vaccine, given that, statistically, 1000 COVID-19 deaths would be prevented for every 1m people inoculated, while scientists would expect one fatal case of the blood disorder.

"But people do not think in terms of risk-benefit," he said. "We give these vaccines to healthy people, so there's zero tolerance when it comes to severe side effects."

Another member of the JCVI, who backs an alternative jab for the under-40s, said the risk-benefit calculation of the AstraZeneca vaccine for those in their 30s "doesn't really square up."

The incidence rate of the clotting condition for people in that age group who had the AstraZeneca jab appeared to be between 1 in 50 000 to 1 in 100 000, the person said, while modelling suggests roughly 1 in 30 000 to 1 in 50 000 people need to be vaccinated to prevent a single death in the same cohort from COVID-19, the JCVI member added.

Others on the committee are more sanguine. Robert Dingwall, professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University and a member of the JCVI, said he believed there was enough uncertainty about the exact relationship between the vaccine and the clotting disorder to justify giving AstraZeneca to those between 30 and 39.

"Offering an alternative to AZ to all under-40s would be a big step in terms of confidence," he said, adding that any effective restriction would slow the rollout of the UK's vaccine programme and increase the risk to those who remain unvaccinated.

Analysts at Airfinity have previously estimated the change in guidance for the use of AstraZeneca in the under-30s could set the UK's inoculation drive back by a month.

Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said the JCVI had to make the "best decisions on the evidence they have."

AstraZeneca declined to comment.

[2b] AstraZeneca clots rise to 168
Date: Thu 22 Apr 2021 2:50 p.m. PDT
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/british-regulator-says-astrazeneca-covid-shot-clots-rise-168-2021-04-22/


Britain's medicines regulator on Thursday [22 Apr 2021] said there had been 168 major blood clots following a dose of AstraZeneca's (AZN.L) COVID-19 vaccine, a rate of 7.9 clots per million doses, a jump in incidence from the previous week's figure.

This was up from the 100 cases reported last week, when the overall case incidence was 4.9 per million doses.

There has been scrutiny of the AstraZeneca vaccine on the issue of the very rare clots, and some countries, including Britain, have recommended that only people over a certain age get the shot.

Adam Finn, Professor of Paediatrics at Bristol University, said the jump in reported cases was expected.

"Cases are being reported reliably and quickly, but there are also cases that occurred previously now being recognised and reported as well," Finn said. "I would expect the true number of cases per million doses of vaccine to become clear fairly soon as these reports stabilise, but it is already clear that it is going to remain a very rare event."

There have been 21.2 million 1st doses of AstraZeneca's shot given in Britain's rollout, with all except one of the side effect case reports coming after a 1st dose. A total was not given for 2nd doses administered.

There were 32 reported deaths from clots in total, compared to 22 reported last week, but the fatality rate of the reported clots dropped to 19% from 22%.

Britain has advised that under-30s receive an alternative to the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, after the MHRA [Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency] medicine regulator found there was evidence of a link to rare clots with low platelet levels.

Officials have emphasised the side effect is "vanishingly" rare and advised that most people still get the shots. The preference for under-30s to get a different shot is mainly informed by that age group's low risk from COVID-19, combined with Britain's low prevalence of infection.

That differs from several European countries such as France, which has decided to restrict use of AstraZeneca's shot to people over 55.

"On the basis of this ongoing review, the advice remains that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks in the majority of people," the MHRA said on Thursday [22 Apr 2021], reiterating its advice for the shot.

This report covers the period 9 Dec 2020-14 Apr 2021.

Summary
At the time of this report, over 127 000 people across the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus (COVID-19).

Vaccination is the single most effective way to reduce deaths and severe illness from COVID-19. A national immunisation campaign has been underway since early December 2020.

Three COVID-19 vaccines, Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford University/AstraZeneca, and Moderna vaccines, are currently being used in the UK. All have been authorised for supply by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) following a thorough review of safety, quality, and efficacy information from clinical trials. In clinical trials, the vaccines showed very high levels of protection against symptomatic infections with COVID-19. Data are now available on the impact of the vaccination campaign in reducing infections and illness in the UK.

All vaccines and medicines have some side effects. These side effects need to be continuously balanced against the expected benefits in preventing illness.

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was evaluated in clinical trials involving more than 44 000 participants. The most frequent adverse reactions in trials were pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pains), chills, arthralgia (joint pains), and fever; these were each reported in more than 1 in 10 people. These reactions were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. Adverse reactions were reported less frequently in older adults (over 55 years) than in younger people.

The Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine was evaluated in clinical trials involving more than 23 000 participants. The most frequently reported adverse reactions in these trials were injection-site tenderness, injection-site pain, headache, fatigue, myalgia, malaise, pyrexia (fever), chills, arthralgia, and nausea; these were each reported in more than 1 in 10 people. The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity and usually resolved within a few days of vaccination. Adverse reactions reported after the 2nd dose were milder and reported less frequently than after the 1st dose. Adverse reactions were generally milder and reported less frequently in older adults (65 years and older) than in younger people.

The Moderna vaccine was evaluated in clinical trials involving more than 30 000 participants. The most frequent adverse reactions in these trials were pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pains), arthralgia (joint pains), chills, nausea/vomiting, axillary swelling/tenderness (swelling/tenderness of glands in the armpit), fever, injection site swelling and redness; these were each reported in more than 1 in 10 people. These reactions were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. Adverse reactions were reported less frequently in older adults (over 65 years) than in younger people.

The MHRA's role is to continually monitor safety during widespread use of a vaccine. We have in place a proactive strategy to do this. We also work closely with our public health partners in reviewing the effectiveness and impact of the vaccines to ensure the benefits continue to outweigh any possible side effects.

[3] Pregnancy

[3a] COVID-19 in pregnancy and adverse effects
Date: Thu 22 Apr 2021
Source: Science [abridged, edited]
https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/04/clear-link-emerges-between-covid-19-and-pregnancy-complications


Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, it has become increasingly clear that COVID-19 hits pregnant women harder than the general population. Now, one of the 1st large studies with a proper control group has firmed up earlier evidence for how the virus can alter the course of pregnancy and harm mothers and their newborns.

The study of more than 2100 pregnant women enrolled at hospitals in 18 countries found that, compared with uninfected pregnant women, those with COVID-19 are at higher risk for severe illness, death, pregnancy complications, and preterm birth. Those results underscore the importance of including pregnant women in priority groups for COVID-19 vaccines and limiting their exposure to ill people, says corresponding author Aris Papageorghiou, a fetal medicine specialist at the University of Oxford.

"This is a great study," says physician, epidemiologist, and public health specialist Nathalie Auger of the University of Montreal Hospital Research Centre, who was not involved with the research. "They followed women through pregnancy, which is a really great design, and helped confirm the previous studies that are much easier to critique."

Many studies have linked pregnancy to worse COVID-19 outcomes, but they have either included too few participants to draw firm conclusions or have relied on health records that women agree to share after the fact. These registries tend to lack details such as when in pregnancy a woman got infected. They also attract sicker patients, which could make the effects of COVID-19 look worse than they actually are.

Such studies also often compare the outcomes for infected women with those for women who gave birth before the pandemic. This lack of a contemporary control group means researchers aren't getting a realistic picture of the risks to uninfected women who gave birth after COVID-19 had upended global health care systems.

To avoid such biases, the new study enrolled women at any stage of pregnancy who received care at 43 medical centers, from Russia to India to Brazil, between March and October 2020. For each infected woman, the researchers immediately enrolled 2 pregnant women at the same hospital and same stage of pregnancy without a known infection. They then followed both groups of women -- 706 with a COVID-19 infection and 1424 without -- through their babies' deliveries and after discharge from the hospital.

Clear differences emerged between the 2 groups. Those with COVID-19 had a 76% greater chance of pregnancy-induced high blood pressure, known as preeclampsia or eclampsia. They were 3 times as likely to have a severe infection and 5 times as likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit, Papageorghiou's team reports today [Thu 22 Apr 2021] in JAMA Pediatrics. Eleven women with COVID-19 died, compared with just one woman in the uninfected group.

The study also linked COVID-19 to a 60-97% increased rate of preterm birth, and -- in infected women with a fever and shortness of breath -- to a 5-fold increase in neonatal complications such as immature lungs, brain damage, and eye disorders. About 13% of babies tested positive for the virus, and cesarean delivery was linked to a higher risk of transmission. Breastfeeding didn't appear to transmit the virus, a small bit of good news.

The risk estimates are roughly in line with what other studies have found, Papageorghiou says, including a recently published study that looked at health records for more than 400 000 U.S. pregnant women, nearly 6400 with COVID-19.

The new study helps makes the case for offering all pregnant women COVID-19 vaccines, Papageorghiou says. "We believe pregnancy itself [puts women into] a sufficiently high-risk group," he says. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) includes pregnancy under high-risk medical conditions with priority for vaccines, but not all states have included pregnancy in priority groups. In the United Kingdom, pregnant women were only recently added to such groups.

Because the approved vaccines were not tested in pregnant women, some health authorities are hesitant to prioritize them for vaccination, despite reassurances from obstetrics experts that the shots appear safe in this group. Preliminary evidence published yesterday [Wed 21 Apr 2021] in The New England Journal of Medicine supports this view. Using data from a CDC reporting system, researchers found no obvious safety problems in more than 800 U.S. women who gave birth after receiving messenger RNA vaccines in December 2020, January [2021], and February [2021].

The higher rates of preterm birth found in the study are especially relevant in lower-income countries, where healthcare systems are less able to care for premature infants, Papageorghiou adds. "The challenge will be much more severe in those settings."

Key points
Question: To what extent does COVID-19 in pregnancy alter the risks of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes compared with pregnant individuals without COVID-19?

Findings: In this multinational cohort study of 2130 pregnant women in 18 countries, women with COVID-19 diagnosis were at increased risk of a composite maternal morbidity and mortality index. Newborns of women with COVID-19 diagnosis had significantly higher severe neonatal morbidity index and severe perinatal morbidity and mortality index compared with newborns of women without COVID-19 diagnosis.

Meaning: This study indicates a consistent association between pregnant individuals with COVID-19 diagnosis and higher rates of adverse outcomes, including maternal mortality, preeclampsia, and preterm birth compared with pregnant individuals without COVID-19 diagnosis.]

Summary from Johns Hopkins report:
Pregnant women with COVID-19, compared with those not infected,
- were 5X as likely to be admitted to an ICU;
- were 3X as likely to have a severe infection;
- had a 60-97% increased rate of preterm birth; and
- had a 76% greater chance of preeclampsia or eclampsia.
Encouraging finding: Breastfeeding didn't appear to transmit the virus.

This study is one of the 1st large studies of its kind with a "proper control group," Science noted.]

[The best approach for a pregnant woman to protect herself and her unborn baby is to get vaccinated with one of the mRNA vaccines. These vaccines appear to be safe even during pregnancy and will prevent risk to the fetus should the mother become infected [see next report]. An infection of the new coronavirus in newborns is associated with a "3-fold risk of severe medical complications, according to the study described above conducted by scientists at the University of Oxford (https://bit.ly/3tNwkJ7).

Pregnant women are at higher risk of complications such as premature birth, high blood pressure with organ failure risk, need for intensive care, and possible death" (https://www.reuters.com/world/more-risks-pregnant-women-their-newborns-covid-19-than-known-before-study-2021-04-23/). - Mod.LK]

Abstract
Background
Many pregnant persons in the United States are receiving messenger RNA (mRNA) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines, but data are limited on their safety in pregnancy.

Methods
From 14 Dec 2020-28 Feb 2021, we used data from the "v-safe after vaccination health checker" surveillance system, the v-safe pregnancy registry, and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to characterize the initial safety of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines in pregnant persons.

Results
A total of 35 691 v-safe participants 16-54 years of age identified as pregnant. Injection-site pain was reported more frequently among pregnant persons than among nonpregnant women, whereas headache, myalgia, chills, and fever were reported less frequently. Among 3958 participants enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry, 827 had a completed pregnancy, of which 115 (13.9%) resulted in a pregnancy loss and 712 (86.1%) resulted in a live birth (mostly among participants with vaccination in the 3rd trimester). Adverse neonatal outcomes included preterm birth (in 9.4%) and small size for gestational age (in 3.2%); no neonatal deaths were reported. Although not directly comparable, calculated proportions of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in persons vaccinated against COVID-19 who had a completed pregnancy were similar to incidences reported in studies involving pregnant women that were conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic. Among 221 pregnancy-related adverse events reported to the VAERS, the most frequently reported event was spontaneous abortion (46 cases).

Conclusions
Preliminary findings did not show obvious safety signals among pregnant persons who received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. However, more longitudinal follow-up, including follow-up of large numbers of women vaccinated earlier in pregnancy, is necessary to inform maternal, pregnancy, and infant outcomes.

Bangladesh recorded 98 coronavirus-related deaths in the last 24 hours till 8:00 a.m. yesterday [22 Apr 2021] as the 2nd wave of the deadly virus overwhelms hospitals and pushes the health sector to its limits.

The virus also infected 4014 others during the period, the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) said in a handout.

Coronavirus deaths now stand at 10 781 with a mortality rate of 1.46%, according to the DGHS.

The daily infection rate fell to 14.63% from Wednesday's [21 Apr 2021] 15.07%.

On [Mon 19 Apr 2021], the country had broken all the previous records of COVID-19 deaths, registering 112 fatalities. It saw over 100 deaths on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday [16-18 Apr 2021].

Bangladesh reported its 1st coronavirus cases on [8 Mar 2020] and the 1st death on [18 Mar 2020].

Health authorities have so far confirmed 736 074 cases. Among them, 642 449 people -- 87.28% of all patients -- have recovered.

India added more than 3.3 lakh [330 000] cases on [Thu 22 Apr 2021], the 2nd consecutive day it added over 3 lakh [300 000] new cases, and a new record for any country anywhere in the world. No country had so far added these many cases for 2 consecutive days.

If cases continue to grow at this rate, then India could add about a million cases in 3 days, another dubious global record the country could have done without.

[Thu 22 Apr 2021] also marked the 17th consecutive day that more than a lakh [100 000] new cases have been added, and the impact is evident on the healthcare system and the surge in daily fatalities. For the 10th consecutive day, India witnessed over 1000 daily deaths, of which the last 3 days saw over 2000 daily deaths. In the past 10 days alone, over 15 000 people have died because of COVID or related complications.

Among states, Maharashtra continued to lead with 67 013 new cases. Uttar Pradesh (34 379), Kerala (26 995), Delhi (26 169), and Karnataka (25 795) were the other 4 states that reported over 25 000 daily cases. Chhattisgarh reported 16 750 new cases while cases reported from Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, and Andhra Pradesh were between 10 000 and 15 000. Similarly, cases reported from Haryana, Jharkhand, Odisha, Telangana, and Punjab were between 5000 and 10 000. Even smaller states like Uttarakhand, J&K [Jammu and Kashmir], Himachal Pradesh, and Goa have also reported 1000-5000 cases. With 1931 new cases, Assam is the only large state on this list.

As in cases, Maharashtra is also leading the country in daily deaths as the state reported 568 deaths on [Thu 22 Apr 2021]. It was followed by the national capital, which reported 306 deaths, and Chhattisgarh, which reported 207 deaths. Uttar Pradesh (195), Gujarat (137), and Karnataka (123) were the other states that reported over 100 deaths on [Thu 22 Apr 2021]. Apart from these states, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Bihar, West Bengal, and Haryana all reported over 50 deaths.

Prime Minister Imran Khan has convened a meeting of the National Coordination Committee [NCC] on COVID-19 on Friday [23 Apr 2021] to review the pandemic situation and devise a future strategy as over 5800 persons tested positive for the contagious virus and 98 lost their lives over the past 24 hours.

The decision to convene the NCC meeting was announced by the Prime Minister Office after Mr Khan received a briefing on the COVID-19 situation from Minister for Planning and Development Asad Umar and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Health Dr Faisal Sultan here on Thursday evening [22 Apr 2021].

Talking to Dawn after his meeting with the prime minister, SAPM Dr Sultan said that during the NCC meeting they would take up with the provinces the issue of non-implementation of SOPs (standard operating procedures) required to prevent the spread of the disease.

Dr Sultan said they would ask the provinces to ensure strict implementation of the existing SOPs to avoid the imposition of more curbs. Expressing concern over the current situation, the SAPM regretted that the people even in a small city like Islamabad were "taking it lightly, what to talk about other big cities."

The SAPM said the data about the disease would be shared with the provinces in the NCC meeting. He said the media was wrongly reporting about the extended lockdown during Ramazan, saying that any such decision would only be made with the consensus of the provinces. He said it was not possible for them to take decisions without consulting the provinces and the country's leadership. The SAPM said that whatever the decision would be made it would be taken with consensus.

Dr Sultan said that though the burden on the country's health system was constantly increasing, the situation in Pakistan was still better than in many counties of the world. He refuted the allegations that the government had failed to tackle the situation. He gave the example of neighbouring India where, he said, the situation was worse than in Pakistan.

According to a source, the NCC in its meeting will also discuss if more countries should be included in the list of category C for travel restrictions.

According to data released by the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC), 5857 new cases and 98 deaths were reported on [Thu 22 Apr 2021], of which 28 died on ventilators. Overall, 559 ventilators were in use across the country; however, no patient was on a vent in Gilgit-Baltistan and Balochistan.

Moreover, 100% vents were occupied in Mardan, 88% in Gujranwala, 85% in Multan, and 82% in Lahore. About 85% oxygenated beds were occupied in Gujranwala, 74% in Peshawar, and 67% in Nowshera and Swabi.

The number of active cases rose to 84 935 on [Thu 22 Apr 2021]. A total of 778 238 cases have been detected so far, while 676 605 people have recovered. As many as 16 698 deaths have been reported since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in February last year [2020]. Moreover, 5450 more patients were admitted to hospitals across the country on [Thu 22 Apr 2020].

The NCOC is also scheduled to meet on [Fri 23 Apr 2021] before its members' participation in the NCC meeting under the prime minister. The meeting, the sources said, is set to consider imposing further curbs across the country in case of the failure of the authorities to implement SOPs.

Minister for Planning and Development Asad Umar had on [Wed 21 Apr 2021] announced that the NCOC would impose further curbs during its meeting on [Fri 23 Apr 2021] as the number of cases and positivity ratio were increasing continuously. He said the decision to put more countries on the list of category-C had been deferred as SAPM Dr Faisal Sultan could not attend the meeting due to his visit to Peshawar along with Prime Minister Khan. The decision would be taken on [Fri 23 Apr 2021].

"We have reached the edge, and the situation can get out of control anytime. The cities which are under pressure include Lahore, Peshawar, Mardan, Nowshera, Faisalabad, Multan, and Rawalpindi. Islamabad is still included in the list of safe cities. 2 months ago, Karachi's positivity ratio was just 2%, but on [Wed 21 Apr 2021] it was recorded at 13%, and 14% in Hyderabad. There might not be a need to make an official announcement of closing down cities as everything would automatically come to a halt if the current trend persisted," Mr Umar had said.

The NCOC had on [19 Apr 2021] placed India on category C countries and banned the entry of inbound passengers from the country for 2 weeks to stop the transportation of the Indian virus which has a double mutation. The forum had also announced that it would consider imposing similar restrictions on some other countries.

International travel to Pakistan from category C countries is restricted and only allowed as per guidelines of the NCOC.

A PAF [Pakistan Air Force] special plane carrying 500 000 doses of SinoVac vaccine had arrived at Nur Khan Airbase from China on [Wed 21 Apr 2021]. The consignment has been procured on payment.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 23 Apr 2021 at 05:48 GMT:

Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 16 263 695 / 186 928 / 134
Pakistan: 784 108 / 16 842 / 75
Bangladesh: 736 074 / 10 781 / 65
Nepal: 292 152 / 3117 / 105
Sri Lanka: 98 722 / 634 / 30
Afghanistan: 58 542 / 2565 / 65
Maldives: 27 084 /71 / 130
Bhutan: 992 / 1 / 1

Over the last 7 days, 1 971 778, 28 712, and 38 926 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, respectively, compared with 1 231 375, 41 230, and 34353 cases in the preceding 7 days, revealing the continuation of the sharp-uptrend of the disease in India, a decreasing trend in Bangladesh, and a slightly increasing trend in Pakistan.

On 16 Apr 2021, for the 1st time, Bangladesh registered the deaths of more than 100 people in a single day due to COVID-19, and the highest number of deaths (112) associated with the disease was recorded 2 days later, on 19 Apr 2021. The country-wide lock-dock imposed from 14 Apr 2021 might have had a contributory role in seeing a decreasing trend of the disease over the last 7 days; but the daily case-positivity, which was 14.6% yesterday (22 Apr 2021), is still alarming.

The COVID-19 situation in India is going from bad to worse over time. The country registered around 330 000 cases yesterday (22 Apr 2021), and around a million in the course of just 3 days, as indicated in item [2] above. The daily number of new cases in the country is now more than 3 times higher than the highest peak recorded during the 1st wave of the disease. It is difficult to predict when this exponential surge of new cases in the country would eventually reach the peak in spite of the vaccination rollout across the country. By 22 Apr 2021, at least 132.3 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered across the county (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-cumulative-covid-19-vaccination-coverage-exceeds-13-23-crores/articleshow/82194831.cms).

Over the last 7 days, 10 098 and 2773 new cases were reported in Nepal and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared with 2954 and 1696 cases in the previous 7 days, indicating more than 3-fold increase in Nepal and more than 50% increase in Sri Lanka over a period of just 7 days. The sharp increase of new cases continually over the last 2 weeks in Nepal suggests that a new wave of the disease has seemingly started in the country as well. The country should take immediate stringent measures to curb the spread of the disease until it proves to be too late. Only time would say whether or not Sri Lanka would see the same outcome in the near future despite the ongoing vaccination rollout across the country.
