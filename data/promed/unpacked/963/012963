A girl from Bernalillo County has contracted bubonic plague, the 4th
case of plague in New Mexico in 2006. She is being treated at the
University of New Mexico Hospital.
The Albuquerque Environmental Health Department says it will conduct
an investigation at the girl's home to assess any possible risk for
other people to contract the illness.
