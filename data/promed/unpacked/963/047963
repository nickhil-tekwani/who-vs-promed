make up the difference in cumulative cases and number of deaths. The
variance seen in number of discharged and number of suspected may be due to

[A] China - asymptomatic infection from Australian Broadcasting Company 31
May 2003
<http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/scitech/SciTechRepublish_868748.htm>
China has found that some people infected with SARS do not show any
symptoms of the disease and are not infectious after their bodies develop
antibodies to fight the disease, according to state media.
The findings, by Government scientists in Heyuan city in southern China's
Guangdong province, add further mystery to Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS), for which there is no known vaccine or cure. The China
News Service (CNS) reports that scientists have concluded that SARS can be
asymptomatic, after studying people who had come in contact with Heyuan's
first SARS case. Heyuan SARS experts checked [the case's] family members,
health workers who treated him, the doctor in his village, and conducted
blood tests on 5 of these people. CNS reports they found some of the 5
people have the SARS virus in their blood, but have not fallen ill and have
developed antibodies to fight the virus. The scientists believe people who
have developed antibodies for the SARS virus are not infectious. The
report could not immediately be confirmed.
[B] Democratic Republic of the Congo from All Africa 30 May 2003
<http://allafrica.com/stories/200305300538.html>
Several persons suspected of being carriers of the SARS virus were put in
quarantine last Sunday, 25 May 2003 at Kinshasa airport. The DR Congo's
minister of health, LÃ©onard Mashako Mamba, announced on Monday that all had
come from Hong Kong via South Africa. 2 Gambian citizens, a Congolese
national and a unspecified number of Hong Kong Chinese traveled in the same
flight from the Far East to Johannesburg with passengers who showed the
symptoms of the disease, said Congolese health officials. The Congolese
ministry of health says the passengers were allowed to board the flight to
Kinshasa despite their request to the South African authorities, before the
plane's departure, not to allow them to do so. The 2 Gambians and the
Congolese were quarantined at Kinkole, to the east of Kinshasa, in a
special clinic designed to host suspect SARS cases. But the Chinese
citizens could be expelled to South Africa, writes the independent APA news
agency.

[In the past 24 hours there have been reports of 8 new probable cases in
Ontario, Canada, 5 new probable cases in Taiwan, 3 new probable cases in
Hong Kong, and 2 new probable cases in China (1 each from Beijing and Hebei).
The newswire report about asymptomatic infections in China (see [5][A]),
while not substantiated through an official report, are not surprising. It
is not unusual to have asymptomatic infections. Some of the questions that
arise are what proportion of those infected have an asymptomatic infection
(or in reverse, what proportion of those infected have a clinical illness);
and of significant import, do those individuals who have asymptomatic
infections transmit the SARS-associated coronavirus to others? More
details on the study mentioned in the newswire would be appreciated, as
would information from other areas that may have addressed similar questions.
The newswire report from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) [5][B]
is a bit confusing as it is unclear if the individuals mentioned were
isolated because of contact with individual(s) with symptoms compatable
with SARS, or if they themselves had symptoms compatable with SARS. There
is mention that the prior flight (before the flight to the DRC) was via
Johannesburg, and there have not been reports of additional probable cases
from South Africa. Clarification of this from official sources would be
appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
