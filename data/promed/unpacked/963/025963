Abstract
--------
The World Health Organisation has targeted the elimination of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) as zero transmission by 2030.

Continued surveillance needs to be in place for early detection of re-emergent cases. In this context, the performance of diagnostic tests and testing algorithms for detection of the re-emergence of _Trypanosoma brucei gambiense_ HAT remains to be assessed.

We carried out a door-to-door active medical survey for HAT in the historical focus of Batié, South-West [Sud-Ouest] Burkina Faso. Screening was done using 3 rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). 2 laboratory tests (ELISA/_T. b. gambiense_ and immune trypanolysis) and parasitological examination were performed on RDT positives only.

In total, 5883 participants were screened, among which 842 (14%) tested positive in at least one RDT. Blood from 519 RDT positives was examined microscopically but no trypanosomes were observed. The HAT Sero-K-Set test showed the lowest specificity of 89%, while the specificities of SD Bioline HAT and rHAT Sero-Strip were 92% and 99%, respectively. The specificity of ELISA/_T. b. gambiense_ and trypanolysis was 99% (98-99%) and 100% (99-100%), respectively.

Our results suggest that _T. b. gambiense_ is no longer circulating in the study area and that zero transmission has probably been attained. While a least cost analysis is still required, our study showed that RDT preselection followed by trypanolysis may be a useful strategy for post-elimination surveillance in Burkina Faso.

[Batié is a town located in the province of Noumbiel (Sud-Ouest region) in Burkina Faso. It is the capital of Noumbiel Province and has a population of 17 991 (2019) and is the epicenter of trypanosomiasis (African sleeping sickness) in Burkina Faso. Another recent study mapped tsetse flies in Burkina Faso (Percoma L et al. An atlas to support the progressive control of tsetse-transmitted animal trypanosomosis in Burkina Faso. Parasit Vectors. 2022; 15(1): 72; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-05131-4).

Interestingly, pigs have been identified as reservoirs for _Trypanosoma brucei_ in Côte d'Ivoire as cattle has previously been identified as the main reservoir (Traoré BM et al. Free-ranging pigs identified as a multi-reservoir of _Trypanosoma brucei_ and _Trypanosoma congolense_ in the Vavoua area, a historical sleeping sickness focus of Côte d'Ivoire. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2021; 15(12): e0010036; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010036).

PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2022; 16(1): e0010047; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010047).

The study states that "Togo and Côte d'Ivoire were the 1st countries to be validated for achieving elimination of HAT as a public health problem at the national level; applications from 3 additional countries are under review by the World Health Organization (WHO). - Mod.EP
