[2] Guinea: resurgence
Date: Thu 4 Mar 2021 14:07 EST

On 14 Feb [2021], Guinea's health authorities declared the country "in an epidemic situation" after the confirmation of 7 cases of infection with the Ebola virus, including 3 deaths. The whole of West Africa finds itself in a delicate situation, with a real risk of a resurgence of the Ebola epidemic 5 years after a 1st deadly wave that left more than 11 000 dead.

Between March 2014 and December 2015, a national epidemic due to the Ebola virus was declared in Guinea (a resurgence was recorded in 2016 in the prefecture of Nzerekore, but it was quickly contained). The disease then spread very quickly to neighboring countries, notably Liberia and Sierra Leone, with 10 066 and 12 666 cases, respectively. Faced with the rapid spread of the virus, movement restrictions had been imposed, borders closed, and air links suspended.

This year [2021], the virus appeared in the sub-prefecture of Gouecke, a locality with high mobility towards the regional capital, Nzerekore. Being an agroforestry production area, the movement of people and products is a major risk factor for the spread of the disease. Already, a contact of patient zero has been identified in Conakry: he would have previously traveled a distance of about a thousand kilometers (about 620 mi). This means that the risk of the virus spreading to other prefectures or other countries is real. It is this fear that motivates the closure of borders and the slowdown in trade and tourism flows.

At the end of the 2014 epidemic, Guinea had carried out an analysis of the risks of epidemics and disasters that populations could face. This analysis highlighted the significant risk of a resurgence of certain diseases, in particular that caused by the Ebola virus. In total, 9 priority zoonotic diseases (rabies, anthrax, Ebola, dengue, brucellosis, avian influenza, yellow fever, Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever) have been identified and placed under surveillance within the framework of the One Health integrated approach. It is therefore not surprising that the Ebola virus is now resurfacing in Guinea.

At the end of the epidemic in 2016, the Guinean government set up the National Health Security Agency (ANSS), the national institution in charge of managing epidemics, emergencies and health disasters. The agency has been provided with 38 epidemic treatment centers for the management of cases of diseases with epidemic potential, in accordance with the administrative subdivision of the country. For the management of epidemic cases in the communities, 17 improved health centers were built.

The national capacity in terms of laboratories and logistics has been improved. The country now has a network of 5 certified laboratories in Conakry, capable of detecting the main diseases with epidemic potential. Two local laboratories have been set up in the prefectures of Gueckedou and Kindia. The means of transport (motorcycles and cars) have been reinforced to ensure better mobility of the intervention teams.

For emergency interventions in the response to epidemics, the management of the agency has been decentralized. In addition to the national management, epidemic alert and response teams have been set up at the level of regions (regional epidemic alert and response teams [ERARE]) and prefectures (prefectural epidemic alert and response teams [EPARE]). The capacity of the vaccination teams has been strengthened for the implementation of screening activities.

The experiences of the response to the 2014 epidemic and the participation of Guinean teams in the response to Ebola in the DRC have strengthened national capacities in terms of epidemic management.

The principle of responsiveness in interventions is one of the lessons learned from the management of past epidemics. Epidemics spread quickly, with lots of rumors supporting them. The ANSS has already acquired the vaccines to prevent the spread of the virus. The epidemic treatment centers are on alert. With the experience resulting from the management of COVID-19, a videoconferencing system has been set up to coordinate interventions in the different prefectures. Measures have also been implemented to mobilize and involve community nationals in crisis management alongside the ANSS.

The media are also called upon to counter rumors about the existence of the disease, about preventive behavior or even those linked to the involvement of political authorities. To do this, information on the epidemic is regularly shared with them through the social networks of the agency to which they are members.

The 2014 epidemic was marked by the persistence of community reluctance. These take the form of the refusal to identify contact persons; hiding and/or caring for the sick in the community; transporting and cleaning the bodies of people who have died from Ebola; exposure for funeral orations of suspected or proven bodies; unsafe community burials; refusal to allow Red Cross agents to disinfect places believed to be infected, etc.; and verbal and physical violence against actors who do not share these beliefs. This reluctance, whatever its form and nature, is due to ignorance of the disease, received ideas and intervention errors by actors.

It has often happened that it was not the messages that were the problem, but the people who conveyed them. People often tend not to trust people outside their own community. Likewise, the hasty recruitment of inexperienced young people into communities is not without consequences. It was observed during the 2014 epidemic that the protocols for appointing members of community teams (village/neighborhood watch committees) were not respected. The new recruits lacked legitimacy, motivation and availability. The actions they carried out were not based on any result indicator. The gender dimension has often been ignored in the constitution of community teams.

It has been observed that contact persons leave their homes as soon as (a) the monitoring agents are not trustworthy and are considered as strangers in the locality; (b) the disease considered fatal is associated with their locality; (c) the contact is gossiped or stigmatized. Often, people fleeing their locality will already have developed 3 types of fears that will encourage them to leave: fear of suffering the same fate as the deceased, fear of going to the Ebola Treatment Center (CTE) considered as a dying [place], and fear of stigma. Taxi drivers are the 1st accomplices of people who secretly leave their communities.

The Ebola death management system disrupts funeral practices. As a result, cases of community deaths are not reported to allow dignified and secure care (DHS) by specialists. The populations accused the agents in charge of the DHS of not being reactive enough. This poses the problem of the conservation of bodies. Also, families reserve the "sacred" duty to wash the body for the 1st time before community rituals.

Finally, the massive deployment of agents and vehicles for the response in the same place at the same time provokes a feeling of invasion among the populations. This spirit of competition between the partners in the response is detrimental to the spirit of teamwork and sharing.

Although a lot of what is written here has been stated in the past, it is important to review what the lessons from the past outbreaks are and try to implement changes accordingly. - Mod.LK]

[3] Guinea: International Organization for Migration (IOM)
Date: Thu 4 Mar 2021

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is mobilizing to help stop the resurgence of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Guinea and appealing for USD 8 million to support essential outbreak preparedness and response activities, and critical coordination efforts at the national and prefectural levels and key border crossings.

Within days [of the 14 Feb 2021 declaration of the outbreak in the sub-prefecture of Gouecke], IOM deployed the necessary resources to set up 5 health screening points around Gouecke, and on the borders with Cote d'Ivoire and Liberia. In addition, 3 Public Health Emergency Operations Centers were activated with IOM's support to facilitate coordination and intensive contact tracing efforts.

"Since 2014, IOM has had a strong working relationship with national and local health authorities, communities, and other key stakeholders," said Maximilian Diaz, IOM Guinea's Officer in Charge. "We were able to mobilize our teams immediately and help activate strong disease surveillance measures around the epicentre, but much more is needed to make sure the outbreak is contained as fast as possible."

IOM's response strategy will focus on the Gouecke sub-prefecture, the current epicentre, and the surrounding health districts of the N'Zerekore region, which borders Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The Organization carried out preparedness activities in those countries following the 2014 EVD outbreak and is now planning to scale up efforts, including working with public authorities and communities to enhance surveillance at border areas, outreach to inform and engage communities, deployment of additional handwashing stations, and more.

IOM's public health interventions use analysis of human mobility within and across international borders to inform targeted preparedness and response measures to infectious disease outbreaks. The Organization's new plan, in line with the Government's priorities laid out in the National EVD Response Plan, aims to prevent further EVD transmission by:

- strengthening coordination and emergency management capacities at all levels;
- carrying out disease surveillance activities;
- implementing infection prevention and control measures, for example, by setting up handwashing stations;
- and mapping local mobility trends and dynamics to inform decision-making.

Overall, some 4.5 million people are targeted to benefit from these activities.

As of 1 Mar [2021], 4 probable and 13 confirmed cases have been identified, 8 of whom have died. As IOM-supported surveillance activities are already underway, hundreds of contacts have been identified, the majority of which are in N'Zerekore, and some others in the Conakry, Dubreka and Coyah areas. Despite some movement restrictions across official border crossings due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number of cross-border movements continue to take place, which pose a risk for international EVD spread.

"We have witnessed the devastation that delayed action on public health emergencies can do to a community and societies at large," stressed Diaz. "We must stand by the people of Guinea, and we must act fast."

IOM's Global Crisis Response Platform provides an overview of IOM's planned activities and funding requirements to respond to the evolving needs and aspirations of those impacted by, or at risk of, crisis and displacement in 2021 and beyond. The Platform will be regularly updated with new crisis response plans published over the coming weeks.

In line with the 2005 International Health Regulations, IOM uses a mobility-focused approach to public health preparedness and response to infectious diseases, through analysis of the way people travel, with interventions at points of entry, along transit corridors and in congregation spaces.

The aim is to strengthen systems to ensure cases are detected early through health screening points, contact tracing, and community-based mechanisms, targeting locations where the risks are the highest, to ultimately prevent transmission.

In addition, in contexts where access to clean water can be challenging, IOM works to improve people's abilities to wash their hands -- a key aspect of effective EVD and COVID-19 infection prevention -- for example, by rehabilitating boreholes, installing portable handwashing stations, and distributing hygiene kits with soap, among other things.

In recent years, IOM has implemented Ebola-related interventions across a dozen countries -- including Burundi, the DRC, Guinea, Liberia, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Uganda -- to mitigate in-country and cross-border infection.

https://www.guineenews.org/ebola-seule-la-vaccination-peut-briser-la-chaine-de-transmission-prefet-de-nzerekore/amp/?__twitter_impression=true


As announced in one of our previous editions of the morning, the 2nd shipment of vaccines, which should allow the chain of transmission of the Ebola virus to be broken as quickly as possible in N'Zerekore, has just been received by the local administrative and health authorities.

This 2nd batch of vaccines was conveyed by Dr. Sakoba Keita, the Director General of the National Agency for Health Security (ANSS), who was accompanied by representatives of the WHO.

By receiving these vaccines, the prefect of N'Zerekore expressed to the press not only his joy, but also appealed to the populations to avoid any reluctance to this vaccination campaign: "I am happy to receive these vaccines at the moment. Because only vaccination can allow us to end very quickly with this Ebola virus. It is for this reason that I am asking the population to take more responsibility and to cooperate fully in order to break all forms of reluctance."

For the moment, Guinee News could not know the exact quantity of vaccines received this Thursday [4 Mar 2021].
