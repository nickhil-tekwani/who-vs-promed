Sierra Leone: Outbreak of Lassa Fever in Refugee Camps
------------------------------------------------------
On Thu 3 Apr 2003 an outbreak of Lassa fever was reported in refugee camps
in the south and east of the country. This follows the return of a British
solider from Sierra Leone to the UK with Lassa fever in February 2003. This
dangerous viral disease is transmitted by rats and by contact with body
fluids of infected people.
