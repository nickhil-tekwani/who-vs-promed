France confirms new case of deadly SARs-like virus
------------------
A 2nd person has become infected with the new deadly SARs-like coronavirus in northern France after sharing a hospital room with the country's 1st victim, French health authorities said on Sunday [12 May 2013]. Two more potential cases are being investigated.

French health authorities said early Sunday [12 May2013] that a 2nd person had contracted a deadly new SARS-like virus, after sharing a hospital ward with the 1st victim identified in the country.

The virus, [also] known as nCoV-EMC, is a cousin of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which triggered a scare 10 years ago when it erupted in east Asia, leaping to humans from animal hosts and killing some 800 people.

The latest victim shared a hospital room with a 65-year-old man who is in intensive care in the northern town of Lille after being diagnosed with the virus that has already killed 18 people, mostly in Saudi Arabia.

"Positive results (for the virus) have been confirmed," for both patients, who are being treated in isolation wards, the health ministry said in a statement.

Laboratory exams on specimens from a person who shared a room with the 1st case in the hospital in Valenciennes were positive [for the nCoV].

With respect to another close household contact of the 1st patient, laboratory results processed by the Pasteur Institute were negative [for the nCoV].

France confirms new deadly SARS-like virus case
------------------------
French health authorities said one person was suspected of contracting a deadly new SARS-like virus after coming into contact with a man confirmed to be infected, following tests that cleared another 3 patients.

"Further examinations are necessary" to determine if the patient has come down with the deadly novel coronavirus, the health ministry said in a statement.

The patient shared a hospital room with a 65-year-old man who is in intensive care in northern France after being diagnosed with the virus that has killed 18 people, mostly in Saudi Arabia.

The regional health authority said the man, who was hospitalised after returning from a holiday in Dubai in April 2013, was being treated in isolation in a "very serious but stable condition".

It was 1st detected in September 2012 and since then more than 30 cases have been reported in different countries, with 18 deaths.

[with the confirmation of the 2nd case of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) associated with infection with the novel coronavirus (nCoV) in France, this brings the total of confirmed cases of infection with this nCoV to 34. It also brings the number of clusters involving person-to-person transmission of this nCoV to 4 - with prior clusters of person-to-person transmission confirmed in Jordan [April 2012], the UK [February 2013], and Saudi Arabia [April/May 2013]. The prior clusters in Jordan and Saudi Arabia have been associated with contact in health care facilities, while the cluster in the UK involved family contacts. Of note is that these current clusters (Saudi Arabia and France) involve individuals who have been admitted to these health care facilities for medical care of other illnesses, suggesting that risk infection with this nCoV may be increased in individuals with pre-existing co-morbidities. Information on the specific co-morbidities involved is not fully available as yet, although some of the earlier cases were reported to have had illnesses with associated immunocompromise.

As stated in the above press releases, as well as prior ProMED-mail posts on this current situation in France, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health in France is identifying all close contacts of these 2 confirmed cases and continues to monitor for additional cases with placing of suspected infected individuals into isolation while laboratory tests are pending.

As of today, 12 May 2013, the breakdown of total confirmed cases of SARI associated with infection with the nCoV (and deaths) by country of report is:
- Saudi Arabia: 24 (13 deaths)
- Jordan: 2 (2 deaths)
- UK: 4 (one patient from Qatar -- under treatment, 3 patients from UK -- one with history of travel to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan prior to illness; one recovered, 2 deaths)
- Germany: 2 (one patient from Qatar -- discharged, one patient from the UAE -- one death).
- France: 2 (one with a history of travel to the UAE prior to illness; 1 health care facility contact of other case)

(note that the above table shows cases by country of report -- of the total 34 cases confirmed at this time, 25 were presumed to be infected in Saudi Arabia, 2 in Jordan, 2 in Qatar, 2 in the UAE, 2 in the UK and 1 in France).
