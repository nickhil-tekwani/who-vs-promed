In Germany, within the last 4 weeks, a total of 7 adult _Hyalomma_ [genus] ticks were reported to our laboratory. This number is unusually high as during the last 3 years (2015 to 2017) only 2 specimens of _Hyalomma_ ticks were reported to us. At least 2 more _Hyalomma_ ticks are announced to be sent during the next days.

The ticks came from 3 horses (3 ticks from one single horse, 3 ticks on 3 other horses) and from one sheep. Also, 5 ticks arrived at the institute and were identified as _Hyalomma marginatum_ (4 specimens) and _Hyalomma rufipes_ (one specimen). Of the 3 ticks from one horse, 2, unfortunately, got lost during sampling from the horse.

Ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are known to be competent vectors for several tick-borne viruses (among them CCHF virus, Alkhurma virus) and rickettsiae (_Rickettsia aeschlimannii_). All available ticks tested negative for CCHF virus, but one specimen was positive for _Rickettsia aeschlimannii_. Testing of the ticks for Alkhurma virus, Babesia and Theileria is currently underway.

_Hyalomma marginatum_ and _Hyalomma rufipes_ nymphs need prolonged high temperature and low humidity for the development into adults. We hypothesize that due to the more than 8 weeks long hot and dry weather situation in Germany this year [2018], more _Hyalomma_ nymphs, which had been imported by migrating birds from Southern Europe and Africa, could develop into adult ticks and, therefore, be found on livestock. Horses are probably overreported, as they will be checked by their owners regularly, while other free ranging livestock might also be infested without any notice by the owners.

The actual situation this year [2018] indicates that climate change might also facilitate the development of tropical tick species in temperate regions like in Germany and increase the risk of introduction and transmission of tropical tick-borne diseases of medical and veterinary importance.

_Hyalomma marginatum_ ticks are widely distributed geographically, and organisms genotypically indistinguishable from _Rickettsia aeschlimannii_ have previously been detected in these ticks collected in Portugal and Zimbabwe. _R. aeschlimannii_ was 1st characterized following its isolation from _H. marginatum_ ticks in Morocco and in Niger. _Rickettsia aeschlimannii_ is in the spotted fever group but not associated with human disease except for one individual, a South African patient who, on returning from a hunting and fishing trip, discovered a _Rhipicephalus appendiculatus_ tick attached to his right thigh and an eschar around the attachment site. Sequence analysis of the amplification products from a biopsy showed both to be identical and to share over 99 percent similarity with the ompA of _R. aeschlimannii_ (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732514/). Ticks of the _Hyalomma_ genus have transmitted the much more serious Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus in southern Europe. Fortunately, this virus was not present in the ticks tested above.
