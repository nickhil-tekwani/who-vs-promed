Arakan state [now Rakhine state] has the largest outbreak of schistosomiasis cases among 14 states and regions in Myanmar, said Dr. Kyi Lwin, head of the Department of Public Health in Arakan State. "The outbreaks of schistosomiasis are still discovered here. Diarrhea is also prevalent here. Arakan has the most rampant cases of schistosomiasis in Myanmar," Dr. Kyi Lwin told the media in a campaign held on [21 May 2019] at U Ottama Hall in Sittwe to prevent schistosomiasis disease caused by parasitic worms from freshwater snails.

Currently, children are the worst affected group with schistosomiasis, which can lead to anemia, a life- threatening condition, said Dr. Phyu Phyu Aye, Director of Health Education Division. "[The] parasitic worms eat all the nutrients in the body and cause anemia, so, it affects children the worst," she said.

To prevent the disease, people need to access clean food and safe water to ensure personal hygiene and good health.

[Arakan state was renamed Rakhine state 30 years ago. Schistosomiasis has probably been endemic but neglected for decades. The region has seen conflict between the Burmese state, Rakhine nationalists and Rohingya rebels. In more recent times, Rakhine state has been notable for the exodus of refugees into neighboring countries because of military operations by the Myanmar Army against the Rohingya minority (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arakan). - Mod.EP
