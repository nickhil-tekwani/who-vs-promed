Information received on (and dated) 3 Sep 2008 from Dr John Clifford,
deputy administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service,
United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, United States of America

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Start date: 25 Aug 2008
Date of first confirmation of the event: 2 Sep 2008
Report date: 3 Sep 2008
Date submitted to OIE: 4 Sep 2008
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of last occurrence: July 2008
Disease: low pathogenic avian influenza [LPAI] (poultry)
Animal type: terrestrial
Causal agent: low pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype(s): H5N8

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species
Epidemiological comments:
- The game bird owner recently submitted 3 dead birds to the
Pennsylvania Animal Diagnostic Laboratory and Pennsylvania State
University (PSU) for diagnostic work-up.
- The PSU laboratory identified _Pasteurella_ and _Mycoplasma_ from
culture but also ran the PCR [polymerase chain reaction] test for
avian influenza (AI), which is a routine testing procedure. The PCR
test gave positive results for AI. Samples were also forwarded to the
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) for confirmation.
- 29 Aug 2008: the NVSL confirmed an H5 positive, N1 negative PCR finding.
- The premises was quarantined by the Idaho Department of Agriculture
on 29 Aug 2008.
- Enhanced surveillance and epidemiological investigation of the game
bird premises began on 29 Aug 2008 by the Idaho Department of
Agriculture officials, in conjunction with USDA APHIS [US Department
of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service] Veterinary
Services personnel.
- 2 Sep 2008: the NVSL confirmed and reported an H5N8 positive virus
from samples taken from pheasants on the game bird premises.
- 3 Sep 2008: sequencing results from NVSL were compatible with low
pathogenic avian influenza. The sequence is approximately 98.5
percent similar to A/mallard/BC/373/2005 H5N2 and 98.3 percent
similar to A/tundra swan/AK/44049-168/2006 H5N2.

Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: H5 and H7 avian
influenza in its low pathogenic form in poultry is a notifiable
disease as per Chapter 2.7.12. on avian influenza of the Terrestrial
Animal Health Code.

Idaho bird farm quarantined after bird virus found
--------------------------------------------------
A southwestern Idaho bird farm has been quarantined after a bird
there was found to have a low pathogenic bird flu, but Idaho
Department of Agriculture officials say it is not the same bird flu
virus that has spread through birds in Asia, Europe, and Africa.

According to a statement from the Agriculture Department, the type of
virus found in the Idaho game bird is commonly found in wild birds
and normally causes only minor illness in the animals. The statement
said the virus poses little or no risk to human health and it's not
believed that any people have gotten sick in connection with the ill bird.

The Agriculture Department quarantined the farm and will test the
flock, investigate the source of the illness, and notify neighboring
game bird and poultry farms.
