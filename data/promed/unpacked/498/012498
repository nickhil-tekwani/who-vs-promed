Around 80 cases of the mumps (called kusma in Norwegian) have been recorded in Norway recently, mostly among college students. The outbreak began in Trondheim, but residents of Oslo, Bergen and elsewhere along the west coast have also fallen ill.

Mumps is caused by a virus that leaves those infected with painful swelling of the glands in their neck. Symptoms include fever, muscle pain, headache, fatigue and, ultimately, the swelling. It's mostly viewed as a children's disease but can also infect adults, including some who were infected as children or had vaccinations that have worn off over time.

Doctors in Trondheim alerted state officials at the Institute for Public Health (Folkehelseinstituttet) late last week. By then, cases were spreading beyond Trondheim. All students suffering symptoms that can be confused with flu were urged to undergo testing. Dr Karin Ronning of the health institute said the outbreak is believed to have been brought in by foreign students.

"Since 1969, all children in Norway have been offered vaccination against measles via the Childhood Immunisation Programme. The measles vaccine is given in the form of 2 doses of MMR vaccine at 15 months and at 11 years (Grade 6). If there is an increased risk of infection, the vaccine may be given as early as 9 months, but a booster dose at 15 months of age is recommended."

There is an option in Norway to not take vaccines, thus outbreaks such as this current one may occur. Nonetheless, the case count has dropped significantly since 1960; see the URL above for Figure 1 - Cases of measles per 100 000 inhabitants in Norway from 1900 to 2014.
