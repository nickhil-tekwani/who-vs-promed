The Ecuadorian Agriculture Quality Assurance Agency (Agrocalidad)
reported that the outbreak of bovine rabies detected in the Olmedo
canton and parish of Manabi province, is being handled in a timely way
in order to control the effects caused by the disease.

Javier Rodriguez and Luis Mena, Agrocalidad specialists in bovine
rabies control, reported from Olmedo canton that they carried out
follow up for this neurological disease and that the Leopoldo Izquieta
Perez National Institute of Hygiene confirmed the diagnosis of bovine
rabies. So far, the deaths of 4 animals have been confirmed.

Because of this, Agrocalidad, in coordination with local authorities
and the public and private sectors, is implementing the emergency
sanitary measures aimed at control of this pathology [disease] such
as: timely diagnosis, communication of risk (authorities and
producers), focal peripheral vaccination [of livestock], and vector
[vampire bat] control. Officials of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Livestock organized as brigades, have been trained prior to
vaccination, which will start today [10 Jun 2011] in the countryside,
in an area with a 5 km [3 mi] radius around the outbreak.

Bovine rabies is an infectious disease caused by a virus that attacks
domestic and wild mammals, including humans, affecting the nervous
system and without control measures [post exposure treatment] causes
death. The animals can be infected by the bite of the hematophagous
[blood feeding] bat, _Desmodus rotundus_ that in a clinical [infected]
state are carriers of the virus.

[Vampire bat transmitted rabies is a sporadic problem throughout the
tropical Americas. Bovine and equine animals are the preferred hosts
for this bat, but there are occasional human cases, as has been the
case in Amazonas of neighboring Peru in February and March of this
year (2011) (see ProMED-mail no 20110312.0799). Vaccination of cattle
and horses against rabies is prudent and cost effective.
