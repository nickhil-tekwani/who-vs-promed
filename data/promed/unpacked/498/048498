Update on Shared Mutations
--------------------------
The following update on shared mutations [see: SARS - worldwide (63):
etiology 20030423.0994] has been received from Dr Henry Niman.
Yesterday I gave several examples of mutations shared between CUHK-W1 and 5
isolates from the mainland (GZ01, BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04). Since these
mutations were well conserved among mainland isolates, but not found in
other isolates linked to the Metropole Hotel, I thought that the data
supported a Metropole source containing a mixture of variants. Although
CUHK-W1 was isolated from a patient from the Prince of Wales Hospital, I
have been informed by Dennis Lo and Stephen Tsui, who were involved in the
sequencing of this isolate, that the patient was not one of the 138
patients linked to the visitor of the Metropole Hotel. This patient had
traveled to Thailand and mainland China shortly before developing SARS
symptoms, suggesting an origin outside of Hong Kong, consistent with the
shared mutations found with mainland China isolates.
In addition to the D-to-E mutation at position 5768 in orf1ab, which is
found in CUHK-W1, GZ01, BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04, there is another mutation
of a T changing to I at position 244 in E2. This amino acid is found in all
6 isolates. Thus, these 2 sets of shared mutations define 2 hot spots where
6 of the sequenced isolates have one amino acid while the other 4 have
another. This distribution raises the possibility that the true mutations
are the amino acids shared by the Tor2, Urbani, KYK, and HKU-39849
isolates. I have not yet been able to obtain the history of the HKU-39849
isolate. However, there is another shared mutation at position 577 of E2 in
which S replaces A. This mutation is found in KYK, which is from a tourist
who stayed at the Metropole Hotel. However, the mutation is shared with,
BJ01 and GZ01, isolates from the mainland. This mutation is not seen in
Tor2 or Urbani, 2 isolates closely linked to the Metropole Hotel. Thus, the
distribution of this mutation supports the notion that the infections at
the Metropole Hotel involved a number of variants. As noted above, however,
Tor2, Urbani, KYK, and HKU-39849 share amino acids found at position 5769
in orf1ab and position 244 in E2, which supports a more closely related
source of the infections at the Metropole Hotel.
These shared mutations, especially the 2 loci that are shared by the 5
mainland isolates and CUHK-W1, support an etiological role for SARS
coronavirus in SARS.
Here is the list of shared mutations:
(1) orf1ab [the putative polymerase gene]:
3047 V to A [Val to Ala] in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, CUHK-W1
3072 V to A [Val to Ala] in CUHK-W1*
3196 A to V [Ala to Val} in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03
5768 D to E [Asp to Glu] in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04, GZ01, CUHK-W1
(2) E2 [putative glycoprotein gene]:
77 G to D [Gly toAsp] in BJ03, CUHK-W1
244 T to I [Thr to Ile] in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04, GZ01, CUHK-W1
577 A to S [Ala to Ser] in KYK, BJ01, GZ01
(3) N [putative nucleoprotein gene]
387 N to P [Asn to Pro] in GZ01, BJ02
* This change is only in CUHK-W1, not BJ01, BJ02, BJ03 as reported
yesterday [see: SARS - worldwide (63): etiology 20030423.0994] - the 3
Beijing isolates have a shared mutation at position 3196, which is A to V,
as well as V to A change at position 3047.

2 distinct SARS virus variants from the same patient
----------------------------------------------------
This issue of SARS mutations will likely be viewed with increased interest.
More information is now available on the 5 isolates from mainland China
<http://www.genomics.org.cn:8080/bgi/news/zhongxin/news030416-2_fasta.htm>.
One area of interest is a comparisons of mutations in 2 isolates (BJ01 and
BJ03) from the same individual. The partial data have been submitted to
Genebank, and it is possible that there are some sequencing errors, but the
data are quite strong for multiple variants in the same individual.
There are 4 mutations shared between BJ01 and BJ03. 2 of them are found in
all 5 mainland china isolates as well as CUHK-W1, and the 4 other isolates
may be the true mutations. The 2 widely shared alterations are at position
5768 in orf1ab [the putative polymerase gene] (D changing to E) and I
changing to T at position 244 in E2 [putative glycoprotein gene]. Another
mutation shared between BJ01 and BJ03 is also found in BJ02 and CUHK-W1 (V
changing to A at position 3196). This change is found in BJ02 and CUHK-W1
at position 3047 in orf1ab [the putative polymerase gene]. The fourth
change shared between BJ01 and BJ03 is also found in BJ02 (A changing to V
at position 3196 in orf1ab).
However, in addition to the 4 mutations shared between BJ01 and BJ03, each
isolate has mutations not shared. BJ01 has 3 additional mutations not
shared with the 9 other isolates. All 3 changes are in orf1ab at positions
1718 (L to W), 2230 (A to V), and 2770 (V to I). Since these changes have
not been seen elsewhere, sequencing errors remain a possibility (although
not likely).
In contrast, BJ03 also has 3 mutations not found in BJ01, but 2 of these
mutations have been found in other isolates, reducing the likelihood that
they are due to sequencing errors. The mutation unique to BJ03 is also in
orf1ab at position 3426 (V to I). Of interest are the 2 other mutations in
E2. At position 78, the change of G to D is also found in CUHK-W1, while
the A to S change at position 577 is also found in KYK and GZ01, which were
from patients in Singapore and Guangzhou, respectively.
The finding of this A to S mutation in isolates from 2 other geographically
distinct regions, but not in another isolate from the same patient, raises
issues of multiple variants within the same patient as well as tissue
tropism linked to specific amino acid changes.

sequence comparisons of a small number of SARS coronavirus isolates are
intriguing, it is perhaps too early to speculate on the biological
significance of any of these variable sites. - Mod.CP]
