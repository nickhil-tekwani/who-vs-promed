Q fever: infection possibly by fresh cell therapy/outbreak in Germany
---------------------------------------------------------------------
In the context of the international Health Regulations, Canadian health authorities informed the RKI in the past week about a case of Q fever in a female resident of Canada, who had probably acquired the infection in Germany. The woman had received intramuscular injections in May 2014 containing material from sheep fetuses and sheep placenta (so-called "fresh cells"). The woman became ill nine days later with fever, buttock pain, increased liver enzyme values and pleural effusion. In Jul 2014 the diagnosis Q fever was confirmed. The treatment in the form of so-called fresh cell injections took place in a treatment facility in the Federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate (RP). More information on the case from Canada is still pending.

By investigations of responsible public health authorities in the aforementioned Federal state at the beginning of August 2014, a Q fever outbreak was discovered. 12 cases (5 male, 7 female, median age 49 years [range: 28-59]) from RP with a laboratory diagnosis were announced, with 10 of the 12 people ill, and 6 hospitalized. A further epidemiologically linked case from the Munich urban area was announced.

All laboratory-confirmed cases lived or worked in close proximity to sheep enterprises.

[It appears that the Canadian woman was infected from cells from sheep fetuses in the midst of an outbreak of German cases linked geographically to infected ovine farms, an unusual form of transmission.

_Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen, causes Q fever. _C. burnetii_ is highly resistant to drying and heat, which is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle. Domestic ungulates such as sheep, cattle, and goats serve as the reservoir of infection for humans.

Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms that are shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products of infected animals; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness with hepatitis or pneumonia usually develop within 2-3 weeks after exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever recover, others may experience serious chronic illness within a few months or several years after acute infection, with complications that include endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), infected aneurysms or vascular prostheses, and chronic hepatitis.

Usually, Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with infected domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats and for laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures and working with _C. burnetii_-infected animals (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88923/). Sporadic cases can also occur in people living in urban areas that are downstream from farms or abattoirs where the organisms have become aerosolized. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites and ingestion of unpasteurized milk or dairy products (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm). Q fever has rarely followed blood transfusion, bone marrow transplantation, and suspected sexual transmission via infected sperm (http://www.gezondheidsraad.nl/sites/default/files/201115EQfever.pdf).

Q fever spreads easily in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing the _C. burnetii_ for a considerable distances to involve people living downwind from infected livestock. Widespread transmission of Q fever was recently documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm from a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5 km [3 mile] high-risk zone (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2).

The acute and chronic stages of infection correspond to 2 distinct antigenic phases of antibody response. During an acute infection, an antibody response to _C. burnetii_ phase II antigen is predominant and is higher than the response to the phase I antigen, whereas chronic infection is associated with a rising phase I immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer.

CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has recently issued recommendations for the recognition, clinical and laboratory diagnosis, treatment, and management of Q fever (CDC. Diagnosis and Management of Q Fever -- United States, 2013: Recommendations from CDC and the Q Fever Working Group. Morb Mortal Wkly Rep (MMWR). Recommendations and Reports. 29 Mar 2013/62(RR03); 1-23. Available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm).

Cell therapy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_therapy), also called cellular therapy or cytotherapy, is therapy in which cellular material is injected into a patient; this generally means intact, living cells. For example, T cells capable of fighting cancer cells via cell-mediated immunity may be injected in the course of immunotherapy.

Cell therapy originated in the 19th century when scientists experimented by injecting animal material in an attempt to prevent and treat illness; such attempts produced no positive benefit. In some forms of alternative medicine, the practice of injecting animal materials in an attempt to cure disease is perpetuated. The practice, according to the American Cancer Society, is not backed by any medical evidence of effectiveness, and can have deadly consequences. - Mod.LL]

[ProMED reported a similar case in a Canadian injected with sheep cells in Germany in 1997 -- see: Q fever, suspected - Canada ex Germany: RFI Archive No. 19971210.2462. - Mod.JW]

[Q fever, a zoonotic bacterial disease, is endemic in Germany where it is included in the lists of notifiable human and animal diseases. The common transmission route is inhalation of infected aerosolized particles carried over distances of up to 2-5 km (1.2-3.1 mi) or by direct contact with birth products of infected ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats).

Reportedly, between 80 and 400 human cases per year are reported in Germany, with 40-80 percent of these related to outbreaks (clusters of human cases). The incidence of human disease is usually lower in winter, half the number of human cases found in summer (ref 1). However, a recent outbreak started during the winter, namely in January 2014, continuing to mid April 2014. This outbreak, in the community of Sulzfeld, Bavaria (south Germany) was reported and described in posting 20140511.2464862, citing a media report of 9 May 2014. A later report of 16 May 2014 indicated that 14 people had been infected in Sulzfeld since January 2014, 6 of which had to be hospitalised, 24 others suspected. As source of infection, the public health authorities mentioned a sheep and a goat (see, in German, at http://www.br.de/nachrichten/unterfranken/q-fieber-welle-sulzfeld-100.html).

According to the 2013 annual report of Germany's RKI (Robert Koch Institut), the number of human cases officially reported during 2013 was 115, 58 percent lower than in 2012 and the lowest number since 2007. A graph showing weekly figures for the years 2008-2013 is available in fig 6.41.1 (page 168) of the report (ref 2). According to OIE's most recent available data from Germany (January-June 2013), during these 6 months, 106 Q-fever outbreaks were reported in animals, of which 102 in cattle, 3 in sheep, and 1 in a goat. The data for (entire) previous years are: 2009: 106, 2010: 121, 2011: 171, 2012: 246 outbreaks. This may be indicative of a continuous increased incidence. Information on the number of outbreaks in animals during the 2nd semester of 2013, and about their respective species, will be appreciated.

The animal population of Germany (2013 figures) is: cattle 12.7 million, sheep 1.57 million, goat 150 000. According to OIE data, no vaccination of animals against Q fever is applied in Germany.
