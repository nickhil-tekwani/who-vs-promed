Children at 2 schools in southeast England offered hepatitis A vaccination
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
More then 200 schoolchildren have been offered hepatitis A vaccine
after the identification of 2 clusters of the disease in the
southeast of England. The index case was a schoolchild who developed
clinical symptoms on 3 Mar [2008]. Subsequently, infection of 3
members of a 2nd family was microbiologically confirmed on 28 May
[2008]

The existence of a 2nd cluster was confirmed when 2 cases were
microbiologically confirmed in a 3rd family, one of whose members
attended a special needs school. Another school-aged child in the 2nd
family was a classmate of the index case.

The local Health Protection Unit subsequently made available
hepatitis A vaccine to children at the 2 schools where cases have
been identified. It also disseminated advice about the importance of
good hygiene in school settings.

Staff members who had direct contact with children at the special
needs school are also being offered hepatitis A vaccine. Specimens
from the cases are currently undergoing further testing at the HPA's
Centre for Infections.

Groups most commonly at risk of infection with hepatitis A are
intravenous drug users, men who have sex with men, and international
travellers between the ages of 25 and 44 years. The disease is less
severe in young children who are often asymptomatic despite being
infected.

The HPA believes that susceptibility in the general population is
high and that the potential risk of outbreaks has increased in recent
years.

[It is not clear whether there is a link between the 2 clusters or if
there is a common source of infection. Hepatitis A is a self-limiting
disease and there should no long-term consequences of the infection
for these children. - Mod.CP]
