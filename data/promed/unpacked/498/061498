An outbreak of influenza in four nursing homes in Sheffield
Outbreaks of influenza have occurred in four nursing homes for elderly
people in Sheffield (A, B, C, D). The first case in home A arose on 21
March, and 46 out of 60 residents have since been affected, with nine
deaths. Fifteen out of 65 staff have also had symptoms. Influenza
vaccination is known to have been provided in this nursing home. In home
B, 12 out of 56 residents have been affected and two deaths have
occurred Â– five staff are also ill. In home C, 20 out of 30 residents
and one staff member are ill, but no deaths have been reported. Most
recently, in home D, 12 of 58 residents and four staff are ill.
Nasopharyngeal aspirates and serum specimens from cases in the first
three homes were sent to Sheffield Public Health Laboratory and
confirmed influenza A virus infection. The use of agency nursing staff
common to the nursing homes may have contributed to the sequential
spread of the localised outbreak.
Although consultation rates in general practice for influenza and
influenza- like illness reported by the Royal College of General
Practitioners sentinel surveillance scheme have fallen below baseline
levels (25 cases per 100,000 population in week 15), increased levels of
activity are still being seen in some areas.
Influenza outbreaks can occur in nursing homes despite good vaccination
coverage and may be associated with significant mortality. The antiviral
drug amantadine may be useful in controlling outbreaks of influenza A.
Recent guidance from Canada suggests that amantadine should be given to
all residents simultaneously, regardless of vaccination status, as soon
as an outbreak is recognised. Amantadine will not benefit and should not
be given to residents who have been ill for longer than 48 hours, or who
have already recovered. Residents who are given amantadine should be
monitored carefully.
