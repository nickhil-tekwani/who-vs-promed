[2] French Mediterranean
Date: 24-29 Jul 2015

Lacour G, L'Ambert G, Cross M, et al: A retrospective review of chikungunya and dengue outbreaks in French Mediterranean area in view of the biology of the Asian tiger mosquito
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
The Asian tiger mosquito, _Aedes albopictus_, is an invasive species that is extending its distribution range in the Mediterranean Basin since 1990. The establishment of this vector represents s new health issue which resulted in several chikungunya (CHIKV) and dengue (DENV) outbreaks since 2007. Within Western Europe, France is very exposed as shown by the frequently reported autochthonous cases (11 CHIKV and 4 DENV confirmed indigenous cases in 2014). Here we present an integrated analysis of these cases using biological, environmental and socio-economic parameters. The entomological risk was modeled and mapped to point out the influence of the seasonal dynamics of the vector (female density, diapause status, etc.) on the start and potential duration of outbreaks. The mosquitoes' sensitivity to deltamethrin was studied in function of their different seasonal phenotypes. The recurrent ecological patterns of indigenous transmission are discussed to optimize vector control strategies and surveillance.

Discussion
----------
The recurrent autochthonous transmission of CHIKV and DENV in France is linked to the vector competence and population dynamics. Indigenous transmission occurred less than 3 full years after a local introduction of _Ae. albopictus_. No outbreak began before August, partly due to lower transmission risk. Early outbreaks are possible which could lead, at worst, to a large-scale outbreak. The possibility of reappearance of an outbreak from diapausing mosquitoes should also be considered. To avoid these scenari, we recommend a generalized spring larval source reduction by operators (preceding and/or following autochthonous transmission) and an increased vigilance at the beginning of summer by physicians. Hence the French surveillance and treatment process sows a elative efficiency, even though it is impossible to prove that actual outbreaks have been avoided.
