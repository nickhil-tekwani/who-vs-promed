Montana recorded its 1st suspected case of chronic wasting disease [CWD] in wild elk Monday [25 Nov 2019]. The cow elk was harvested by a landowner on private land northeast of Red Lodge earlier this month [November 2019], and samples were extracted from the carcass in Billings on 6 Nov [2019]. Test results confirming the suspected presence of the disease were returned to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP) and the hunter on Monday [25 Nov 2019].

CWD was found in a herd of captive game-farm elk near Philipsburg in 1999, and the herd was depopulated. Until this week, however, the disease had not been found in wild elk in Montana.

In addition to the elk, Monday's [25 Nov 2019] test results confirmed the presence of CWD in 3 more deer in Southcentral Montana. They included a mule deer harvested on national forest land near Crooked Creek in the Pryor Mountains, a white-tailed deer northwest of Worden, and a white-tailed deer on private land northeast of Silesia.

Tissue samples from the suspected CWD-positive animals will undergo additional testing for confirmation. Hunters who harvested the animals have been informed of the test results.

CWD 1st was confirmed in the wild in Montana in a mule deer in Carbon County in 2017 as a result of scheduled searches on harvested game. Earlier this month [November 2019], tests showed a moose in northwest Montana was suspected to have CWD. All other cases since the disease was discovered in Montana in 2017 have been in white-tailed deer and mule deer.

This fall, FWP is encouraging anyone who harvests a deer, elk, or moose in Montana to submit tissue samples for CWD testing at no cost to the hunter.

CWD is an always-fatal, prion-based disease affecting the nervous system of deer, elk, and moose. Transmission can most commonly occur through direct contact between animals, including urine, feces, saliva, blood, and antler velvet. Carcasses of infected animals may serve as a source of environmental contamination as well and can infect other animals coming into contact with that carcass.

There is no known transmission of CWD to humans. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hunters harvesting an animal in an area where CWD is known to be present have their animal tested. The animal's head and throat area are required for testing purposes. If the animal tests positive, CDC advises against eating the meat.

The 2019 general hunting season ended on Sun 1 Dec 2019.

Southcentral Montana hunters wanting to have their animals tested for CWD may collect the samples themselves and mail them using instructions posted online at http://fwp.mt.gov/cwd.

Technicians are available to help extract and submit tissue samples during normal business hours at FWP's Region 5 Headquarters, 2300 Lake Elmo Dr. in Billings Heights.

[This represents an expansion into wild elk, and likely represents an increase in CWD territory.

What is fascinating is this article indicates that the prion (infective agent for CWD) can be found in urine. So why is it that many baits are urine or urine based, and no one seems to be testing the urine or prohibiting deer urine from attracting other animals? I am uncertain if any work has been done on how long the agent is viable in the urine used to attract the animals. - Mod.TG
