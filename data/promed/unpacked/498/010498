[1] Hawaii
[2] US FDA recall

More reports of salmonella poisoning, after people ate previously
frozen 'ahi bought from local grocery stores, prompt the State Health
Department and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to launch an
investigation to trace the origin of the infected fish.

Health officials traced 11 cases of salmonella poisoning to Choyce
Products, who voluntarily recalled close to 55-hundred pounds of
yellow fin 'ahi a week ago [see recall below. - Mod.LL]

"They need to go to the larger grocery chains and remove that product
or have those grocery chains show that in fact this product is safe,"
EnviroWatch Carroll Cox said. "In this case the alarm is greater
because this is Paratyphi B associated with fecal matter," Cox added.

Health experts say this specific type of salmonella is extremely rare
in the US and most commonly found in Southeast Asia. "Most likely
indicates a lack of good manufacturing practices and sanitation...
you can have all the rules and regulations in place but you need to
have the practice," Pacific Management Resources Dr John Kaneko said.

Choyce Products says they "unknowingly received the tainted 'ahi,
immediately recalled it and stopped purchases from this specific
supplier indefinitely." Choyce continues to say "the suppliers we buy
from test in the government certified labs before shipment."

Health officials say to use caution when buying raw fish, make sure
to purchase the fish from a guaranteed fresh market.

[Although not specifically stated, the serotype here is the
d-tartrate fermenting variant _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_
serovar Paratyphi B dT+ (sometimes referred to as _S._ Java). This
organism has well-characterized animal reservoirs and has been
involved in 2 recent outbreaks reported in ProMED-mail, one in the
USA (Salmonellosis, human, pet turtles - USA 20080125.0317) and the
other in Europe (Salmonellosis, serotype Paratyphi var Java - Europe
20071221.4100).

Exactly how many more reports of illness is not clear. Purchasing
fresh and not frozen product does not guarantee its safety, rather it
would not be related to this recall. - Mod.LL]

[2] US FDA recall
Date: Sat 9 Feb 2008

Choyce Products of Honolulu, Hawaii is voluntarily recalling 5452
pounds (2473 kg) of frozen yellowfin tuna because it has the
potential to be contaminated with salmonella.

The frozen product was distributed on Oahu and most likely reached
consumers in the form of a mixed, previously frozen, seafood product
through its customers. Choyce Products received the tuna from a
mainland importer who confirmed the tuna was sent from Indonesia.

Choyce Products' customers received the cubed tuna in frozen form.
The frozen product is packaged in labeled white cardboard shipping
boxes containing 22 pounds (10 kg) of product. These boxes each
contain 11 2-pound (0.9 kg) packages of vacuum-packed product in
unlabeled plastic bags. White stickers on the cardboard shipping
boxes have the following code information:

Lot Number 0727408005899 with Production Dates 1 & 2 Oct 2007
Lot Number 0725008005899 with Production Date 7 Sep 2007
Lot Number 0726408005899 with Production Date 21 Sep 2007

Choyce Products unknowingly sold the tuna to its customers before
learning of the possible contamination. The FDA and the state of
Hawaii are conducting a joint investigation of a variety of vendors
due to the state receiving salmonellosis reports between 1 Oct 2007
and 31 Dec 2007. The source has not yet been identified. Choyce
Products will destroy all returned and inventoried recalled product.

recall was linked to the human cases. Besides Hawai'i, cases have
been reported in Colorado and California.
