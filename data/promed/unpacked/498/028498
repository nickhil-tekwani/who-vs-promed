The Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) has commenced a comprehensive survey on Cadang-cadang disease in coconut in Camarines Norte.

PCA Camarines Norte's Editah P. Idnani said that the province and other provinces in Bicol region as well as in Region IV-A and Region VII are affected by the Cadang-cadang viroid infestation based on the yearly monitoring conducted by the PCA - Albay Research Center.

Under the Cadang-cadang Containment and Rehabilitation program, PCA targets to eliminate Cadang-cadang disease in coconuts not only in this province but also in other provinces in the regions cited.

Some 100 000 hectares of land planted with coconut will be under surveillance. The ground survey is being conducted by enumerators in all the 12 municipalities in the province.

[Cadang-cadang disease (CC) of coconut palm is caused by _Coconut cadang-cadang viroid_ (CCCVd; type member of genus _Cocadviroid_). In its 246nt form, it is the smallest known pathogen. It is unusual amongst viroids in that it affects monocot species and is invariably lethal to its host. CC occurs on coconut and some other palm species in the central Philippines, where it is estimated to have killed more than 40 million coconut palms. The disease goes through 3 well defined stages which include leaf spots, reduced leaflets, reduced crown, scarification of nuts, and eventually nut production ceases. It may take more than 20 years for palms to die.

Variants with only few nucleotide changes have been identified causing severely increased symptoms on coconut ("brooming" form) and are also associated with the widespread "genetic" orange spotting (GOS) of oilpalm. Other variants have been shown to occur in symptomless herbaceous monocots throughout the Pacific region. The related _Coconut Tinangaja Viroid_ (CTiVd) causes a similar disease on coconut palm on Guam.

CCCVd spreads naturally in both coconut and oilpalm, but its epidemiology and means of natural spread are as yet unknown. No insect vectors have been identified. Transmission can occur by cutting tools; seed transmission occurs at a very low level, and spread by pollen is also suspected. Herbaceous monocots may play a role in CCCVd epidemiology, possibly as pathogen reservoirs. Resistant palm varieties are not known. Disease management for coconut palm relies solely on replacing affected palms before they cease to bear. For oilpalm, symptomatic seedlings are usually removed from commercial plantings, but symptomless palms have been shown to exist and may serve as pathogen reservoirs.
