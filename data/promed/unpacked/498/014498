Medical experts from the Federal Ministry of Health have confirmed
that Lassa fever, a virus disease carried by rodents like rats,
caused the recent death of 2 medical doctors at the Ebonyi State
University Teaching Hospital (EBSUTH).

As a result the state government has declared war on rats as a way of
curtailing the spread of the virus.

Yesterday [20 Mar 2008], Dr Mike Ochoga, leader of a team of medical
experts from Abuja to Abakaliki, said that although investigation is
still ongoing, definitive diagnosis identified the virus, Lassa
fever, which he said was first reported in Ebonyi state in 2005, as
the killer of the medical doctor that died recently in EBSUTH.

He explained that the 1st victim had already died and had been buried
before his team was invited and so they could not definitely say that
his death was also caused by Lassa fever since no specimen from his
remains was tested.

Dr Ochoga revealed that Lassa fever was first discovered in Borno
state, Nigeria in 1969 in a village called Lassa; hence the name
Lassa fever.

Two medical doctors had recently died in EBSUTH in quick succession,
resulting in the invitation of medical experts from the Federal
Ministry of Health, Abuja to investigate the matter. Subsequently,
the Ebonyi state government has declared that since Lassa fever virus
is being carried by a special type of rat that is common in West
Africa, the state's ministry of health has decided to carry out
enlightenment campaigns against bush burning and rat hunting for
consumption.

Commissioner for Health in the state, Dr Sunday Nwangene said: "In
fact we shall be encouraging people to kill all rats in their houses;
my environmental officers will go about rat decapitation and
fumigation of possible environments like the teaching hospital has
just done."

Nwangene stated that government's reaction was sparked off by the
sudden death of a medical doctor in his prime, early this month
[March 2008], at EBSUTH where a similar death was recorded on 23 Jan
[2008].

Speaking in a statewide sensitization campaign for health workers,
the health commissioner said: "It is quite proper to inform you of
the reason for your gathering this noon...it is simply because of an
outbreak of a disease threatening the precious lives of everyone
including you since January this year [2008] and appears to have
summoned more courage in its severity of morbidity and frightening
mortality." The commissioner explained that Lassa fever is a viral
disease carried by rodents like rats, stressing that the virus
infects humans with its infected urine, saliva, and stool
contaminating human food, adding that it could spread among humans
through contact with infected body fluids.

[It is not clear if laboratory diagnosis of Lassa fever virus was
made in the 2nd case cited in this article. ProMED-mail would
appreciate receiving confirmation. Lassa fever virus, in the
arenavirus family, is endemic in West Africa in the rodent _Mastomys_
spp. A description of Lassa fever and its epidemiology, with an image
of _Mastomys_ can be accessed at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/lassaf.htm>.

Lassa fever is a common infection in West Africa, with estimates that
range from 100 000 - 300 000 cases annually with 5000 deaths.
Prevention of transmission from rodents to people requires continuous
rodent control. This is extraordinarily difficult to get ordinary
people to do in the absence of human cases in their immediate
vicinity. Many cases occur in hospital settings, where barrier
nursing is not practiced and staff are exposed to blood, exudates,
and excreta from infected patients. Infection of health care staff is
common.

Although Lassa fever is endemic, not emerging, in West Africa, the
justification for reporting it on ProMED, which focuses on emerging
diseases, is that it is a hemorrhagic fever. - Mod.JW]
