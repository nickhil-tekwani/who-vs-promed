As two pathogens have been identified in this incident and the vehicle of tranmission is known the thread name has been changed from "Aspergillus meningitis - USA" to "Fungal infection, contaminated drug - USA". - Mod.SH

As of 10 Oct 2012, CDC's fungal disease laboratory has confirmed the presence of the fungus exserohilum in 10 people with meningitis and the fungus aspergillus in [only] 1 person with meningitis.

Clinicians should continue to contact patients who have received medicines associated with 3 lots of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (80mg/ml) from the New England Compounding Center (NECC) that were recalled on 26 Sep 2012. The potentially contaminated injections were given starting 21 May 2012. See updated Clinician Guidance webpage for more information, including new case definitions.

CDC's guidance to patients has not changed as a result of the expanded voluntary recall of all NECC products, announced on 6 Oct 2012. Patients who feel ill and are concerned about whether they received a medication from one of the NECC products recalled on 26 Sep 2012 should contact their physician.

Patients need to remain vigilant for onset of symptoms because fungal infections can be slow to develop. Typically in this outbreak, symptoms have appeared 1 to 4 weeks following injection, but it's important to know that longer and shorter periods of time between injection and onset of symptoms have been reported. Therefore, patients and physicians need to closely watch for symptoms for at least several months following the injection.

[The 1st non-CNS infection was reported on 12 Oct 2012, as expected, in an infected joint.

_Exserohilum_ is one genus of a group of molds causing pheohyphomycosis, disease caused by the so-called dematiceous or darkly pigmented fungi. Formerly referred to as _Helminthosporium_ or _Drechslera_, there are 3 species found in human disease, _E. rostratum_, _E. longirostratm_, and _E. mcginnisii_ although molecular studies have suggested that they may be the same. The organism is characterized by its long, multidistoseptate conidia and a protruding hilum connecting to a geniculate conidiophore cell. A picture of _E. rostratum_ can be found at http://www.doctorfungus.org/imageban/images/init_images/251MIKE.JPG.

Melanin in the molds is probably a virulence factor and it is in the form dihydroxynaphthalene melanin. The substance may confer a protective advantage by scavenging free radicals and hypochlorite produced by phagocytic cells in their oxidative burst and could bind to hydrolytic enzymes and antifungal drugs (1).

Most reported human infections have occurred in area with warm climates such as India, Israel, and the southern USA. Noninvasive disease due to the mold such as superficial keratitis and allergic fungal keratitis are related to local trauma and atopy, respectively. Invasive infections with the organism occurs mostly in immunocompromised hosts such as those with leukemia on chemotherapy, aplastic anemia, organ transplantation, diabetes and corticosteroid use (2) and manifest as cutaneous and subcutaneous infection as as well as invasive sinusitis invading the CNS.
