KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE, NOSOCOMIAL, DRUG-RESISTANT: REQUEST FOR INFO
*******************************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

At the moment we have highly epidemic extended spectrum beta
lactamase-producing (ESBL) _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ at our intensive care
department and in [the] trauma department.
For 15 years we used to use garamycin for prophylactic and empiric
treatments (intensive care). Today almost all [isolates of] _K.
pneumoniae_ are resistant to garamycin and tobramycin, but only few to
amikacin.
We want to [stop using] garamycin for at least 2 years, and to use amikacin
instead.
Any experience with such a procedure? We are afraid of [development of
resistance to] all aminoglycosides.
The usual procedures (hand washing, gloves...)didn't bring results. Is it
better to stop using ceftazidim or other antibiotics. We still believe,
its just epidemic and not endemic.
