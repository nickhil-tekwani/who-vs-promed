A recent ProMED posting (11 Nov. 1997) [citation 02 above from Geoff
Letchworth pointed out that human infection with vesicular stomatitis (VS)
serogroup viruses (members of genus _Vesiculovirus_) is not uncommon among
veterinarians, animal handlers and laboratory personnel having contact with
sick livestock or infected laboratory materials. It is important to remind
readers that serological surveys done among human populations living in
rural areas of tropical America and Central Asia indicate that many other
people are also infected with VSV group viruses. Most of these people have
no history of contact with infected animals or laboratory exposure to the
viruses. The mechanism of their infection or of virus transmission is
uncertain, although biting insects have been implicated. Furthermore,
infection with VS group viruses is not always benign. At least two cases
of severe encephalitis due to VS group viruses (VS Indiana and Chandipura)
have been reported in children. For those interested in reading more on
the subject, the following references are recommended:

[A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, Karl Johnson hypothesized that
VS viruses might really be plant viruses. As I recall, his thinking was
that many plant viruses are transmitted by plant-feeding arthropods, that
male mosquitoes also feed on plants, and that, perhaps by venereal
transmission (to breeding partners, which take blood meals), male
mosquitoes might introduce a plant virus to the vertebrate world. It
remains a fascinating hypothesis. Thanks to the marvelous Bob Tesh for the
historical perspective and, in the manner of the good Professor, providing
germane references. Now, if we can just get him into a tweed jacket with
patched elbows ... - Mod.CHC
