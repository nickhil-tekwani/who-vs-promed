INFLUENZA VACCINES, NEW TECHNOLOGY NEEDED: OPINION
**************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Greg Poland <poland.gregory@mayo.edu>

Above and beyond all the obvious things that need to occur, we must begin
to develop technology that will allow the rapid, large-scale manufacture of
influenza vaccines that are NOT dependent upon chicken eggs. Our current
influenza vaccine manufacturing processes (devised in the 1940's!) require
the inoculation of chicken eggs with the given strain(s) of influenza.
Whole virus particles are then harvested from chick embryo allantoic fluid,
inactivated and purified for vaccine manufacture. The current H5N1 flu
issue should, I hope, make us aware of the problem of using 1940's era
technology, and prompt more investment into new technologies of influenza
vaccine manufacture.

[The old "feather and beak" vaccine days are gone, thank goodness.
Nonetheless, there are some changes that are needed. A number of alternate
influenza vaccines are being developed and evaluated; it's actually a hot
(and potentially remunerative) area of research. These include oral
vaccines as well as non-chicken origin vaccines. Rather than begin a
string about which we know little or nothing, I suggest that those
interested in alternative influenza vaccines contact Brian Murphy or Bob
Channock at NIH/Bethesda, Alan Kendal or Nancy Cox at CDC/Atlanta, or Greg
Tannock <gtan@rmit.edu.au> in Melbourne. I am absolutely certain there are
many other people out there who are knowledgeable about this avenue of
research but I ain't one of them. - Mod.CHC]
