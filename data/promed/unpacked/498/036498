[Equine rhinopneumonitis (ER) is a historically derived term that describes a constellation of several disease entities of horses that may include respiratory disease, abortion, neonatal foal pneumonitis, or myeloencephalopathy. The disease has been recognised for over 60 years as a threat to the international horse industry, and is caused by either of 2 members of the _Herpesviridae_ family, equid (or equine) herpesvirus-1 and -4 (EHV-1 and EHV-4). The 2 herpesviruses are enzootic in all countries in which large populations of horses are maintained as part of the cultural tradition or agricultural economy. ER is highly contagious among susceptible horses, with viral transmission to cohort animals occurring by inhalation of aerosols of virus-laden respiratory secretions.

There is no recorded evidence that the 2 herpesviruses of ER pose any health risks to humans working with the agents.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, and references please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2013, Chapter 2.5.9 - Equine rhinopneumonitis, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.09_EQUINE_RHINO.pdf.

Recommendations for international trade for EHV-1 (abortigenic and paralytic forms only) are spelled out in chapter 12.8 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.12.8.htm.

According to the last 6-monthly report (January-June 2013) sent to the OIE, equine rhinopneumonitis is an endemic disease in Chile. It is reported as present in the country (clinical disease); http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Animalsituation. Chile has reported ER to the OIE since 1996 -- see data on Handistaus II at http://web.oie.int/hs2/sit_pays_mald_pl.asp?c_pays=34&c_mald=66.

This is the 1st time that EHV-4 has been specifically identified suggesting that perhaps only EHV-1 had been occurring in the country.

Quantitative information provided by OIE's WAHID database -- the detailed country disease incidence section shows that outbreaks of ER have occurred in the following regions of the country: Arica y Parinacota, Tarapaca, Bio-Bio, Coquimbo, Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins, Maule, Santiago Metropolitan Region, and Valparaiso. http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail.
