ProMED posting Yellow fever - Peru (Cuzco)
20070216.0592 is causing some reaction in the travel medicine world.

Cuzco (3400 m) is actually much higher than Machu
Picchu (2300m), and both are too high for _Aedes_
capable of transmitting YF. This is a common
misconception, as most often people fly into a
place and then have to go up to get to the final
target, but in this case travelers actually fly into Cuzco and go down.

US CDC guidelines state
explicitly: "Travelers who are limiting travel
to the cities of Cuzco and Machu Picchu do not
need vaccination". The 3 cases of yellow fever
which have [just now] been reported in a
long-infected place, La Convencion, in the
low-jungle in a remote northern area of Cuzco
department (not Cuzco city) would not impact the
thinking behind these recommendations.

Cuzco and Machu Picchu are the most visited
purely tourist destinations in South America, and
attract many elderly travelers who are at much
higher risk of severe adverse reactions to yellow
fever vaccine, so it would be unwise to over-vaccinate unecessarily.

Of course, yellow fever vaccine is also
underutilized in many travelers going to true
risk areas, or on uncertain itineraries, so
consultation with a qualified travel medicine
practitioner is always advisable prior to travel.

[I regret this serious error. I did not know
this detail in the CDC guidelines, but I did know
that maps show Cuzco city lying outside the area
of risk for YF in Peru. However, I based my
comment on maps showing the whole country of Peru
as infested by _Aedes aegypti_, presumably
including the major cities, and the risk that a
case from the valleys could be hospitalized in
Cuzco city. Since I now know there are no such
mosquitoes in the city, obviously there is no risk there. - Mod.JW]
