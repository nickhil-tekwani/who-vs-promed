Alberta Agriculture Minister Nate Horner says an older animal has tested positive for atypical mad cow disease in the province.

It's Alberta's 1st case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also known as BSE, in almost 6 years.

Horner says atypical BSE presents no risk to human health and is not transmissible.

He says the case is not expected to affect the market and quick detection demonstrates that inspectors and producers are dedicated to keeping the disease out of Canada's cattle herd.

This type of BSE happens at a rate of about one in one million cattle and has been reported 6 times in the United States, the last time in 2018.

Classic BSE is what caused previous mad cow epidemics, says Sabine Gilch, professor at the University of Calgary's faculty of veterinary medicine. But atypical BSE has a different story.

Gilch says it's very unlikely that atypical BSE is caused by infection, it happens spontaneously in older cows with a very low frequency.

To date [17 Dec 2021], there is no evidence that it is transmitted to humans or from cow to cow. It's thought to be a spontaneous disease, and the same thing can happen in humans, which is called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is leading the response and officials are to meet with stakeholders Monday [20 Dec 2021] to answer any questions.

[Atypical and classical BSE

BSE is an always fatal, progressive disease of cattle. It belongs to a group of diseases affecting the nervous system of humans and animals called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. BSE is associated with the presence of an abnormal form of a protein called prion protein. There is no treatment or vaccine currently available for the disease.

There are 2 different forms of BSE

Atypical BSE (H type and L type):
• Develops spontaneously in any cattle population
• Transmission to humans has never been reported
• The two types of atypical BSE (H and L) were identified in 2004. It is a very rare disease, and is expected to occur in all cattle populations, regardless of the control measures in place
• Has worldwide distribution, even in countries where no classical BSE has been reported
• Its occurrence is not considered for the purpose of the official BSE risk status recognition by the OIE
• The vast majority of cases (about 92%) worldwide have been detected in animals 8 years or older. The youngest case reported to date was 67 months old
• Three cases in Canada (2 H-type and 1 L-type)

Classical BSE:
• Occurs through an animal's consumption of contaminated feed
• Can cause variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans through the consumption of contaminated beef
• Was 1st diagnosed in cattle in 1986. The implementation of appropriate control measures resulted in its decline worldwide. Today, there are few scattered cases of classical BSE in the world as part of the tail end of the epidemic
• Cases have been reported in more than 20 countries
• Its occurrence may be considered for the purpose of the official BSE risk status recognition by the OIE
• Can affect cattle of any age. The youngest case reported to date was 20 months old
• A total of 17 cases in Canada, the last case in 2015

Canada is required to notify the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) of any occurrence of a confirmed BSE case (either classical or atypical).
