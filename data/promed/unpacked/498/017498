Men hospitalised with anthrax [edited]
--------------------------------------
Two men were admitted to hospital this Tuesday, 10 days after slaughtering
and butchering an infected cow in Carvan in the south east of Romania. The
men were suffering from a high fever and muscular pains, said Camelia
Ciobotary, chief of public health in Constanta. At least 8 people were exposed.

The health officials examined the meat [from the cow] and having diagnosed
anthrax, burnt the carcass, and buried the ashes. Vaccination of the other
[Carvan] livestock has been organised, but no other cases have been seen.

[Our thanks to Marcia for noticing this distant report. Further details
have been requested, but if any readers can provide other information on
this outbreak and the general situation in that part of Romania, it would
be appreciated. The river Danube sweeps around to the west of Constanta and
then north and east to empty into the Black Sea. In the past we have had a
number of anthrax reports from the delta. It seems likely that this deltaic
soil ecology must play a part in maintaining the disease in this part of
Romania and is somehow related to the significant subsoil movement of river
water into the sea in this whole region. - Mod.MHJ]
