Summary of newly-reported viruses this week:
- Afghanistan:
2 new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) from Kandahar, and
1 new WPV1 positive environmental sample from Kandahar.
- Pakistan:
2 new WPV1 positive environmental samples from Islamabad and Punjab (Rawalpindi).
- DR Congo:
1 new case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) from Tanganika.

Afghanistan
- Following advance notification last week, 2 new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were officially reported in the past week, from Kandahar, with onset of paralysis on [5 and 6 Jan 2018]. The total number of WPV1 cases in Afghanistan in 2018 is 3.
- 1 new WPV1 positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, from Kandahar, with collection date on [8 Jan 2018].
- The next set of supplementary immunization days are planned on [12 Feb 2018], during which vaccinators will aim to vaccinate children across 24 provinces. The days are synchronized with a campaign that will take place in Pakistan, part of efforts to interrupt transmission of the virus across the shared border.

Pakistan
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of officially reported WPV1 cases in Pakistan in 2017 remains 8. There are no cases reported in 2018. The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Zhob district, Balochistan province, with onset on [15 Nov 2017].
- 2 new WPV1 positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, from Islamabad and Punjab (Rawalpindi), both collected on [10 Jan 2018].
- The next set of supplementary immunization days are planned on [12 Feb 2018], during which vaccinators will aim to vaccinate about 37 million children across the country. The days are synchronized with a campaign that will take place in Afghanistan, part of efforts to interrupt transmission of the virus across the shared border.

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017.
- The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Monguno Local Government Area, Borno, with onset on [21 Aug 2016].
- Nigeria continues to implement an emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016).
- Post-campaign data from the January [2018] supplementary immunization days in Nigeria is being collated. The campaign aimed to vaccinate over 26 million children using bOPV.
- The next immunization days are planned for early March [2018].
- As part of the emergency response, subnational surveillance continues to be strengthened.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno state, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto states in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These activities include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons camps, and at international borders.
- The next set of supplementary immunization days are planned for early March [2018] and will be synchronized across the whole Lake Chad region.

Central Africa
- 1 new case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), from Tanganika, with onset of paralysis on [20 Nov 2017].
- The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Ankoro district, Tanganyika province, with onset on [25 Nov 2017].
- The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in the DRC in 2017 is 18. There are no cases reported in 2018.
- Outbreak response continues to take place across the country, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.
- Children living in the districts where the latest cases were reported were last targeted with mOPV2 during December [2017] vaccination days.
- The next set of supplementary immunization days are planned for late February [2018].
- Surveillance and immunization activities continue to be strengthened in neighbouring countries.

Middle East
- No new cases of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported this week.
- The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Boukamal district, with onset on [21 Sep 2017].
- The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 remains 74. There are no cases reported in 2018.
- An IPV vaccination round is currently in progress as part of the 2nd phase of the outbreak response, in Damascus, Hasakah, Aleppo governorates and Jurmana district of rural Damascus. IPV is being delivered through fixed centres.
- Children in Hasakah governorate who were missed by mOPV2 vaccination in the 1st round will receive mOPV2 alongside IPV.

[The 2 advanced-notification (and media reported) cases of WPV1 in Afghanistan have been confirmed. The new additional information on these cases includes the dates of onset in January 2018. A positive environmental sample from the same province collected about the same time is consistent with the identification of these cases.

In contrast, Pakistan hasn't reported a case of polio since mid-November 2017, yet there continues to be positive environmental samples for WPV1 in areas that have not been documented to have had cases in some time. Hence, the WPV1 is circulating in the country, and somewhat widely (in last week's update, there were positive environmental samples from Sindh (where there have been cases) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces, whereas this week, the samples are from Islamabad and Punjab (Rawalpindi), "twin cities" in the central region of the country. A map showing the provinces of Pakistan can be found at: https://lizardpoint.com/geography/images/maps/pakistan-labeled.gif?v=20141009 where the somewhat widespread diversity of locations with positive environmental samples can be more clearly seen.

Of additional import is the continuation of identification of cVDPV2 cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. These cases are somewhat delayed in confirmation (date of onset of the current case is in November 2017), so it might be some time before one can be certain that circulation of the virus has been interrupted.

On the good news side, it does appear as though transmission of the cVDPV2 in Syria has been interrupted, with most recent date of onset around the autumn equinox in September 2017.
