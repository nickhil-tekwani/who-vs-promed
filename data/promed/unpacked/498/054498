The international pledge to eradicate a devastating livestock disease affecting mostly sheep and goats has taken on new urgency in the wake of a mass die-off of a rare Mongolian antelope.

Some 900 saiga antelopes (_Saiga tatarica mongolica_) -- almost 10 percent of the sub-species' population -- have been found dead in Mongolia's western Khovd [Hovd] province. Samples taken from carcasses indicated the animals were positive for peste des petits ruminants (PPR), a highly fatal viral disease with plague-like impact on domestic sheep and goat herds, killing up to 90 percent of infected animals.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) are leading a multinational effort to eradicate PPR, which can have devastating food-security and economic impacts, by 2030.

80 percent of the world's estimated 2.1 billion small ruminants live in affected regions and constitute an important asset for a 3rd of poor rural households. PPR, 1st identified in CÃ´te d'Ivoire in the 1940s, is now threatening over 75 countries.

While wildlife has long been considered potentially vulnerable, relatively few actual cases of PPR infection have been documented in free ranging wild goat-like species and never in free-ranging antelope.

The dead are highly suggestive of a spillover event from domestic animals with whom they share common grazing areas, especially in winter when foraging ranges are fewer. Efforts are ongoing to investigate the situation on the ground, geared, in particular, to investigating possible other causes, such as the bacterial infection (_Pasteurella multocida_) that is now suspected to have been the cause of death of hundreds of thousands of saiga in Kazakhstan in 2015.

Saiga in Mongolia are not truly migratory but are certainly nomadic, with an extensive range of about 130 000 square km with seasonal movements in autumn for breeding and early spring for calving. The species, once widely spread across the Eurasian steppes, is classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Mongolia reported its 1st-ever outbreak of PPR in September 2016, when sheep and goat deaths were linked to an extension of PPR cases occurring in China.

The domestic small ruminant population in Mongolia is currently 45 million and plays an essential economic and social role in a country where more than 1/3rd of the population derives its livelihood directly from livestock. Mongolia exports live animals, meat, milk, and is the world's top producer of high-quality cashmere wool.

At that time, FAO and OIE immediately mobilized their Crisis Management Center for Animal Health (CMC-AH) to Ulaanbaatar to help local veterinary services assess the epidemiological situation and propose immediate and medium-term actions aimed at controlling the spread of the disease. More than 11 million domestic small ruminants -- crucial for food security and nutrition -- were vaccinated in the effort.

The saiga deaths, which highlight the extreme vulnerability of animals that have not been exposed to PPR as well as the challenge of protecting wildlife, are an "unprecedented and worrisome development," said OIE Director-General Monique Eloit.

"The OIE will continue to work closely with FAO to assist the Government of Mongolia in dealing with the PPR outbreaks and protect both livestock and wildlife, starting with a new CMC-AH mission in a few days," she said. "To avoid a quick and catastrophic spread of the disease, a close cooperation between the veterinary services and those responsible for wildlife management will be particularly essential."

"More field investigations will have to be carried out to know the extent of the recent outbreak. If PPR is confirmed to be the main cause, the saiga death toll is likely to reach into the thousands in the next 3 months," said Bouna Diop, Secretary of the joint FAO-OIE PPR Eradication Programme.

"For this reason, preparations to face even more extensive disease spread should be made, and we must try to separate contact between domestic ruminants and these prized and endangered wildlife," he added.

Heightened surveillance and vaccination of domestic animals should be considered as the main tool currently available to safeguard this endangered species.

"In parallel, critical communication efforts must be made to let Mongolian herders know the risks of the PPR virus spilling over from saiga to livestock," added Richard Kock Professor of Emerging Diseases from the Royal Veterinary College, London.

"We have learned that these events require a particularly high level of international cooperation and the inclusion of the FAO and OIE world reference laboratories network to ensure full understanding of the epidemiology."

To eradicate the disease worldwide by 2030, FAO and OIE launched in 2016 the PPR Global and Eradication Programme (PPR-GEP), building on a broad international consensus.

A 1st phase covers the period 2017-2021, with a USD 996 million cost estimate.

"The recent Mongolian events show that, in the framework of the PPR-GEP, a regional strategy to contain and eradicate PPR needs to be implemented," underlined Ren Wang, FAO's Assistant Director General in charge of FAO's Agriculture and Consumer Protection Department.

"Resources need to be made available to prevent further spread of the virus in Mongolia as well as in Kazakhstan, Russia or China, where outbreaks were 1st reported in recent years," Wang added.

Saiga populations suffer large, apparently spontaneous disease outbreaks, causing massive mortality. The attributed causes have been foot and mouth disease and pasteurellosis. The possibility of peste des petit ruminants virus infection in saigas has been anticipated, especially since the virus was found in hoof stock in the region. This is the 1st confirmed case in saigas, and an additional threat for the conservation of populations of this bovid species. It should also be taken into account that these recurrent die-offs may be caused by the combination of multiple factors that interact synergistically. Due to their complexity, understanding multifactorial phenomena usually requires integrated and sustained research efforts. - Mod.PMB
