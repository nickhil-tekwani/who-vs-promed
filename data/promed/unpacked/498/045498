On 17 Aug 2006, the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL)
in Ames, Iowa confirmed vesicular stomatitis in a 10-year-old horse
on a premises in Natrona County, Wyoming (near Casper). This is the
1st confirmed case of vesicular stomatitis (VS) in the United States
in 2006; the last case of VS was confirmed in late 2005.
VS is a viral disease which primarily affects horses, cattle, and
swine. The viruses that cause VS have a wide host range. VS also
occasionally affects sheep and goats. In affected livestock, VS
causes blisterlike lesions to form in the mouth and on the dental
pad, tongue, lips, nostrils, hooves, and teats. These blisters swell
and break, leaving raw tissue that is so painful that infected
animals generally refuse to eat and drink, and show signs of
lameness. Weight loss usually follows, and in dairy cows, a drop in
milk production commonly occurs. Affected livestock may appear to be
clinically normal and continue to eat, but may consume only about
half of their normal quantity of feed.
The clinically ill horse was positive for antibodies to vesicular
stomatitis New Jersey (VS-NJ) virus on the competitive enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (cELISA) and was also positive on virus isolation
for VS-NJ virus. The VS-compatible clinical signs and presence of
VS-NJ virus meet the definition to classify this horse as the index
case for the Nation in 2006. There are an additional 29 clinically
normal horses and 25 clinically normal cattle also on the premises.
The affected horse was initially examined as part of a routine
physical exam by a private veterinary practitioner on 12 Aug
2006. The next day, the owner of the horse noticed that the horse
had a swollen muzzle and contacted the veterinarian who came back to
the premises to re-examine the animal on 14 Aug. During the
re-examination, the practitioner noticed that the horse had oral
lesions that were consistent with a vesicular condition and
immediately contacted APHIS, Veterinary Services in Wyoming. A
foreign animal disease investigation was initiated that same day;
appropriate samples were collected and submitted to NVSL. There is
no history of recent movement of this horse from the premises;
however, the owners did report a large burden of Culicoides and large
numbers of biting flies in the vicinity.
The affected premises is currently under State
quarantine. Additional control measures include isolating the horse
from the rest of the animals to ensure that water troughs and feed
buckets are not being shared with other susceptible animals, and
increasing insect control measures.
The Wyoming Department of Agriculture is beginning a public and
veterinary practitioner information and education campaign regarding VS.
APHIS Veterinary Services and the Wyoming Department of Agriculture
will continue to monitor the situation and conduct response
activities in an effort to minimize trade restrictions.

[Typically VS has outbreaks that follow a roughly 10-year cycle.
However, VS has been more common lately. Research has not been able
to identify why the virus often appears in cycles separated by so
many years. - Mod.TG]
