Alert: localised stem rust epidemic in southern Ethiopia
--------------------------------------------------------
A severe, localised stem rust epidemic has broken out in southern Ethiopia during November-December 2013. Bale zone is the most seriously affected, but some spread into other areas is now being reported. The previously resistant cultivar "Digelu" is showing extreme susceptibility, with unsprayed crops exhibiting 100 percent incidence. Fields with close to 100 percent loss have been observed. Approximately 10 000 ha [24 711 acres] of wheat have been effected. Some effective control has been achieved with fungicides.

Samples are currently undergoing analysis. Currently no definitive information is available on the race(s) involved in the epidemic. Within the next few weeks causal race(s) should be determined.

To determine the potential risk in the surrounding region, comprehensive modelling of viable spore deposition from the Bale epidemic has been undertaken. Extreme caution and vigilance is needed in East Africa and the Middle East region. This is an on-going situation.

[Wheat stem rust is caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_. Overall yield losses of up to 80 percent are reported, but some fields are totally destroyed. Stem rust spores are spread by wind and with infected straw. Some grasses or volunteer wheat may generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum for the next cropping season. Disease management may include fungicide applications, control of volunteer wheat, and resistant varieties if available.

New races are emerging, and the most dangerous at present is strain Ug99 (discovered in Uganda in 1999, see ProMED-mail post 19990519.0812), which has overcome the major resistance gene Sr31 used in our current wheat varieties. Since then Ug99 has spread and more Ug99 group strains (that is, strains with Sr31 virulence) overcoming additional host resistance genes and/or with added fungicide resistances have emerged. Such strains are even more difficult to control and counteract the resistance breeding efforts. Breeding programmes have been set up in international cooperation (Delhi Declaration) to establish wheat varieties resistant to Ug99 strains.

Ug99 strains are known to be present in Ethiopia, but from the report above it appears that yet another new strain able to overcome resistance in the currently used cultivar (Digelu) may have appeared. Identification of the races involved in the current outbreak will provide important information for directing current resistance breeding programmes.
