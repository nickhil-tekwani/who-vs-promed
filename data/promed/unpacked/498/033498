Typhoid is on rise in Baglung due to the high temperature and contaminated
water. According to Baglung district hospital, most of the affected come
from Baglung municipality, Bhakunde, Pala, and Khunga.
At least 15 patients of typhoid are visiting the hospital daily for the
treatment over the last few days, said Dr Sagar Rajbhandari of Baglung
hospital.

[Rainy seasons and poor sanitation contribute to all of these outbreaks of
typhoid as well as many other waterborne infections.
The district of Baglung is located in the Western region of Nepal, which is
between the Central and the Mid Western Regions. It can be found on the map

The Kangpokpi area of Senapati district [in the Manipur state - Mod.LL] is
gripped by fear as the number of people affected by a typhoid epidemic, now
under treatment at the community health centre, increased.
A total of 12 people suffering from typhoid were admitted to the Kangpokpi
community health centre in the last few days. Out of them, 6 have been
discharged and another has been referred to the RIMS [Regional Institute of
Medical Sciences] hospital due to seriousness of the condition. The
remaining 5 are undergoing treatment, official reports said.
Out of a total of 83 patients admitted at the center during the current
month [June 2007], most were typhoid patients, hospital sources said.

With the mercury rising, 5 to 6 typhoid cases on average are reported daily
at the city's hospitals. Doctors anticipate the number of patients
complaining about this food- and waterborne disease growing in the coming
days, citing the likely increase in water and food consumption as a reason.
Sharif Astori of Polyclinic said 5 to 7 [new] cases of typhoid are reported
daily at the hospital. Doctors at the Pakistan Institute of Medical
Sciences (PIMS) and the CDA Hospital put the number of typhoid cases
reported to them daily at 6 to 7 and 4 to 5 respectively.
After the beginning of summer, private hospitals and clinics have also
witnessed a gradual surge in the cases of this infectious disease. Dr Asma
Rehman, who runs a private clinic, said she received 12 to 15 patients,
mostly children and youths, each week with symptoms of typhoid. She feared
the number would further increase in the coming days with the rising
temperatures. She said that children drinking unboiled water [were the
commonest] victims of the disease.
Typhoid spreads fast among people and in places where proper sanitation and
hygiene are not taken seriously. "In our country, unfortunately, there are
several such places where people are subjected to various kinds of fatal
diseases, including typhoid due to a lack of awareness," said Dr Rehman.
She said industrialized countries were free from typhoid but that
developing countries were still facing this serious public health problem.
Referring to official statistics, doctors said 1000 in every 100 000
Pakistanis suffered from typhoid each year.
