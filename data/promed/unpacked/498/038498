A comment on: Re: Rabies - China (04): (Shanghai), canine, human
---------------------------
More people could be saved from rabies if the authorities promoted a
10-day quarantine observation of the dog after the bite. Stray dogs
could be contained for observation for this time period. Owned dogs
could be contained in or near their homes. If the dog's appetite (i.e.
pharyngeal function) and alertness remain normal for the entire 10
days, the bite victim would NOT need rabies post-exposure prophylaxis
(PEP). Such quarantines should cost little.

Experimentation in the past showed that infected dogs shed the virus
for only about 5 days or less before the symptoms start in the dog. If
the dog were to become ill during the observation period, it could be
cut short: ideally, the dog would be tested for rabies at that time.
If no testing were available, then the bite victim could just receive
rabies PEP as a precaution. This would allow the biologicals to be
reserved for someone who does need them.

Focusing on canine health is the key to protecting human health when
it comes to rabies. See the Compendium of Animal Rabies Prevention and
Control, 2011: "Rabies virus is excreted in the saliva of infected
dogs, cats, and ferrets during illness and/or for only a few days
before illness or death (59-61). Regardless of rabies vaccination
status, a healthy dog, cat, or ferret that exposes a person should be
confined and observed daily for 10 days from the time of the
exposure." http://nasphv.org/Documents/RabiesCompendium.pdf.

This story also highlights the importance of basic dog vaccination,
licensing, and animal control services.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Beeler for this useful comment. The logistics
and economics of providing such quarantine facilities in a city the
size of Shanghai would be challenging but nonetheless worthy of
consideration by the local authorities. - Mod.CP]
