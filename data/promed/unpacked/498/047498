Local health officials said Thu, 2 Jan 2003, that the salmonella outbreak
linked to a local dairy didn't begin there. Since last month, 47 people
have been confirmed with cases of the food-borne illness.
Test results pointed to unpasteurized milk as the culprit, and people who
recently tested positive [may have gotten] it from others. But analysis of
bacterial strains statewide show the salmonella connected to the dairy is
the same as one found in Ross County in south-central Ohio in October 2002
and in Columbiana County, Ohio near Pennsylvania in the summer of 2002.
"It did not originate [at the dairy]," said Charles Patterson, Clark
County's health commissioner. "We're trying to find some epidemiological
link between [the dairy] and where it came from." But finding that link may
be difficult, he said.
Dairy employees accounted for 16 cases. Now health officials want to see
whether those workers are linked to Ross or Columbiana counties. The Ohio
Department of Health is also asking health officials in those counties
whether the people who tested positive traveled in the Springfield area. A
person in Columbiana County, he said, may have passed the bacteria to
another person who didn't show any symptoms, which include abdominal pain,
vomiting, and diarrhea. That person may have passed it on to someone
else."It could have been 10 people later before it ended up in Ross County,"
Patterson said. "If they're not sick, it is possible for someone to be a
carrier. Instead of getting rid of it, they may shed it for a year. They may
shed it forever."
A Columbiana County person with salmonella in September 2002 still carried
the bacteria as late as last month, Patterson said. Salmonella is usually
contracted from [eating] such things as raw eggs or uncooked meat or from
improper hygiene, such as not washing hands.
The dairy's chief executive officer said Thu 2 Jan 2003 he was relieved to
learn the problem didn't begin at his operation. "We've been and still are
trying to figure this out," he said. "I'm glad science is at a level [that
makes it possible for us to] determine that it didn't originate from here."
Employees who tested positive are not handling food, and won't until they
are confirmed negative twice in tests done more than 24 hours apart,
Patterson said.
The dairy stopped selling raw milk after health officials began
investigating the dairy on 10 Dec 2002. The business also used the milk in
shakes, but now uses milk that has been pasteurized, a heating process that
kills contaminants. The dairy spokesman said it's too soon to decide
whether sales of raw milk should resume. Patterson said he would allow it
because bottles are labeled and include warnings. But the commissioner said
it's uncertain whether the milk can be used again in shakes.

[A variety of infectious and presumptive infectious diseases (including
Brainerd diarrhea) are readily spread to humans by the ingestion of
unpasteurized milk or dairy products produced from unpasteurized milk, such
as cheese. From an infectious diseases standpoint, the labeling of milk as
unpasteurized, even with health warnings, is not adequate to prevent a
number of situations including deaths related to _Listeria monocytogenes_ in
neonates, fetuses, and the immunocompromised, and deaths from salmonellosis
in the elderly and immunocompromised host.
Even if the milk is "certified," it is certified to be unpasteurized, not to
be without risk. The epidemiology of this outbreak has yet to be made clear,
but unpasteurized milk may well have a large role. Even if the outbreak
strain didn't begin there, the milk from this dairy could well have helped
to magnify the outbreak. - Mod.LL]
