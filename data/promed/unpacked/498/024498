There have been further outbreaks of 2 different serotypes of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Taiwan.

Four outbreaks of the H5N2 serotype of the virus have been confirmed in the country. This is the same serotype as has caused the epidemic in the United States.

In these outbreaks, there have been 32 639 cases out of a susceptible population of 54 845 farm birds. 28 634 animals died from the disease, and 26 211 were destroyed to prevent the spread of the disease.

In addition, there has been one outbreak of H5N8 avian influenza, involving 6570 cases in a susceptible population of 12 000 birds. There were 6570 deaths and 5430 birds destroyed.

The areas are under increased monitoring and surveillance.

[The above report is based upon the 2 recent follow-up reports from Taiwan to the OIE pertaining to the continued spread of the HPAI serotypes H5N2 and H5N8 as follows:

1. HPAI H5N2 follow-up 22, Chinese Taipei.
This epizootic started on 7 Jan 2015, causing, so far, 505 outbreaks. See all 22 follow-up reports and an updated summarising map at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=16936.

2. HPAI H5N8 follow-up report 17, Chinese Taipei.
This epizootic started on 8 Jan 2015, causing, so far, 294 outbreaks. All 17 follow-up reports and an updated summarising map is accessible at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=16935.

Both follow-up reports were submitted on 29 May 2015, during the last day of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) 83rd general session of the assembly of delegates (24-29 May 2015). During this general session, Dr Monique Eloit, the current deputy director general of OIE, was elected as the new director general of the OIE for a 5-year term of office (2016-2020). The election by the national delegates representing the member countries of the OIE was performed by secret vote in accordance with the rule "one country, one vote." After 3 consecutive terms of office as director general of the OIE, Dr Bernard Vallat will pass the baton to Dr Monique Eloit on 1 Jan 2016. Both deserve ProMED-mail's heartiest wishes!
