Influenza activity continues, but declines in many countries in the
WHO European Region
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
-------
- Clinical influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory
infection (ARI) activity are decreasing in 24 countries of the [53 in
the] Region.
- According to sentinel surveillance, severe acute respiratory
infection (SARI) shows declining trends in some countries, but remains
above pre-season levels.
- 39 percent of sentinel specimens from patients with ILI and/or ARI,
and 56 percent of specimens from sentinel SARI patients tested
positive for influenza.
- Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 and influenza B continue to
co-circulate in the Region.

Current situation -- week 8/2011 [21-27 Feb 2011]
-------------------------------------------------
During week 8/2011, ILI or ARI consultation rates decreased in all
age groups in 24 of the 35 countries reporting clinical data. Among 38
countries reporting on the geographical spread of influenza, most
reported either widespread (15) or regional (7) activity, while 16
reported either sporadic or local activity. Only 5 countries reported
high-intensity influenza activity (compared with 9 countries last week
[14-20 Feb 2011]), while 21 countries reported medium intensity and 11
countries, low intensity. The impact of influenza on health care
systems was low in 14 and moderate in 10 of the 24 countries reporting
on this indicator.

Data from sentinel hospital-based surveillance for SARI were received
from 9 countries (Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Romania,
the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Serbia, and Ukraine).
Sentinel SARI hospitalizations have decreased substantially in
Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and the Russian Federation,
concurrent with overall declines in outpatient ARI or ILI consultation
rates in these 4 countries. In Romania, Serbia, and Ukraine, SARI
hospitalizations increased, as did the percentage of SARI specimens
testing positive for influenza. Among countries testing 10 or more
sentinel SARI specimens, the percentage testing positive for influenza
ranged from 40 percent in Kazakhstan to 67 percent in Ukraine with a
median of 65 percent (mean: 53 percent). Further information on the
sentinel SARI surveillance systems represented in the EuroFlu bulletin
can be found in the "Overview of sentinel SARI systems in EuroFlu".

Virological situation - week 8/2011 [21-27 Feb 2011]
----------------------------------------------------
Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 was reported to be dominant in 7
countries and co-dominant with influenza B in 16 countries. Influenza
B was dominant in 7 countries.

Sentinel physicians collected 1611 respiratory specimens, of which
621 (39 percent) were positive for influenza virus: 273 (44 percent)
were influenza A and 348 (56 percent) were influenza B. Of the
influenza A viruses, 243 were subtyped: 224 (92 percent) as pandemic
A(H1) and 19 (8 percent) as A(H3). In the 20 countries testing 20 or
more sentinel specimens, influenza positivity ranged from 3 percent to
94 percent, with a median of 39 percent (mean: 39 percent). In
addition, 3639 non-sentinel specimens were reported positive for
influenza: 2538 (70 percent) influenza A and 1101 (30 percent)
influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 2110 were subtyped: 2088 (99
percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 22 (1 percent) as A(H3).

Out of 226 sentinel SARI specimens collected during week 8/2011 (data
from 8 countries), 126 (56 percent) tested positive for influenza: 65
(52 percent) were influenza A; 61 (48 percent) were influenza B. Of
the influenza A viruses, 41 were subtyped: 39 (95 percent) as pandemic
A(H1), and 2 (5 percent) as A(H3).

Cumulative virological update - weeks 40/2010 - 8/2011 [4 Oct 2010-27
Feb 2011]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 69 762 influenza virus detections were reported during
this period, of which 50 098 (72 percent) were influenza A and 19 664
(28 percent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 38 790 were
subtyped: 37 395 (96 percent) as pandemic A(H1), 1 394 (4 percent) as
influenza A(H3) and 1 as influenza A(H1).

From week 40/2010 [4-10 Oct 2010] to week 8/2011 [21-27 Feb 2011],
1057 out of 3626 sentinel SARI specimens (29 percent) tested positive
for influenza. Of these influenza viruses, 526 (50 percent) were
influenza A and 531 (50 percent) influenza B. Of the influenza A
viruses, 357 were subtyped: 331 (93 percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 26
(7 percent) as influenza A(H3).

Since week 40/2010, 2771 influenza viruses have been characterized
antigenically: 1478 were A(H1) pandemic A/California/7/2009
(H1N1)-like; 1107 were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria/2/87
lineage); 102 were A(H3) A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like; 83 were
B/Florida/4/2006-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage); and 1 was
B/Bangladesh/3333/2007-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage). Based on the
genetic characterization of 384 influenza viruses, 164 belonged to the
pandemic A/California/7/2009 A(H1N1) clade; 8 belonged to the pandemic
A/Christchurch/16/2010 A(H1) clade; 38 belonged to the pandemic A/Hong
Kong/2213/2010 A(H1) clade; 34 were reported as A(H1) pandemic not
attributed to group category but belonging to the recently emerged
A/England/142/2010 subgroup characterized by S185T substitution in the
HA; 9 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by A/Perth/16/2009; 6
belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by A/Victoria/208/2009; 20
belonged to the subgroup represented by A/Hong Kong/2121/2010 in the
A/Victoria/208/2009 A(H3) clade; 9 belonged to the
B/Bangladesh/3333/2007 clade (Yamagata lineage); and 96 to the
B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade (Victoria lineage).

Since week 40/2010, 7 countries (Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway,
Spain, Switzerland, and the UK) have screened 990 viruses for
susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and
zanamivir. The UK analysed most of the viruses screened (671). Out of
the 924 pandemic A(H1N1) viruses that were tested, 892 were sensitive
to both inhibitors and 32 viruses (3.5 percent) carried the NA H275Y
mutation. These 32 viruses were resistant to oseltamivir but remained
sensitive to zanamivir. 3 influenza A(H3N2) viruses were tested and
found to be sensitive to both inhibitors. All of the 62 influenza B
viruses tested for susceptibility to oseltamivir and the 63 tested for
susceptibility to zanamivir were found to be sensitive. All 115
pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 viruses and 2 A(H3N2) viruses that
were screened for susceptibility to adamantanes were found to be
resistant.

Comment
-------
Clinical ILI and ARI consultation rates continue to decline
throughout most parts of the WHO European Region with most countries
reporting medium activity. A few countries, however, observe
persisting and increasing clinical outpatient activity. The percentage
of sentinel specimens testing positive for influenza is declining
overall, but remains high in several countries. Whereas pandemic
influenza A(H1N1) 2009 and influenza B currently co-dominate in
northern and western Europe, pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 is the
dominant virus in the central and eastern parts of the Region.

Sentinel surveillance for SARI indicates that SARI hospitalizations
are declining in the south eastern part of the Region, while some
countries in central Europe are observing increasing trends. Prior to
seasonal increases in influenza activity, a relatively large portion
of sentinel SARI hospitalizations occurred in the group aged 0-4. With
increases in influenza activity, however, particularly that associated
with circulation of pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 viruses, there have been
associated increases in the relative proportion of SARI
hospitalizations in older children, young adults and adults.

[In brief: only 5 countries reported high-intensity influenza
activity compared with 9 countries in the previous week (14-20 Feb
2011], The percentage of sentinel specimens testing positive for
influenza is declining overall.

Whereas pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 and influenza B are currently
co-dominant in northern and western Europe, pandemic influenza A(H1N1)
2009 is the dominant virus in the central and eastern parts of the
Region.

Most pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 belonged to one of 3 distinct
clades with the exception of 34 isolates belonging to the recently
emerged subgroup in England characterized by an S185T substitution in
HA.

The EuroFlu website features an interactive map presenting
qualitative indicators of influenza activity (intensity, trend,
geographical spread, and impact) and the dominant virus as assessed by
each of the countries. This information can be accessed by clicking on
the individual countries in the map and readers are recommended to
make use of this facility. - Mod.CP]
