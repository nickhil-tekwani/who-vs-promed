The Community Journalists Network, an independent news service, reported that Cuban health care authorities are not capable of stopping the cholera epidemics in Granma, where according to the official figures shown in local TV, 257 cases have already been confirmed.

The Cuban government has not published information at the national level about this disease since 14 Jul 2012, when they recognized 158 cases of cholera and stated that 3 persons had died. Reports about cholera are restricted to Granma provincial bulletins.

Kenia Gonzalez Medina, provincial director of the Center for Hygiene and Epidemiology, indicated that as of Wed 8 Aug 2012, 11 432 patients in Granma have been treated for diarrhea and vomiting

Significant outbreaks of diarrheal disease have occurred in other provinces as well, such as Villa Clara, often accompanied by respiratory diseases, reported Cubanet, an independent news service.

"We have not declared an epidemic, but the situation is worrisome. More than 7000 cases of respiratory diseases and about 7350 cases of diarrheal disease have been treated, with many massive outbreaks that worsened because of the spring rainy season," recognized Orlando Diaz, director of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Villa Clara, according to a report published in the web.

Cubanet mentioned that Diaz declared that no fatalities had occurred, but according to non official sources, there are at least 3 deceased persons.
