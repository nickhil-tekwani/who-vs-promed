West Nile Virus Found in Liverpool, up-state N.Y.
------------------------------------------------
Onondaga County health officials ordered an emergency spraying of
pesticides Friday night in the Liverpool area after learning that a dead
crow found in the village was infected with West Nile virus. The spraying
over a 2-mile radius in and around the village continued until 2 a.m. today
to kill mosquitoes that can transmit the rare encephalitis virus from birds
to humans. Mosquito larvicides will be applied in the same area next week.
The discovery of the virus in the Liverpool crow makes Onondaga County the
northernmost spot in the United States where the virus has been confirmed,
and that has officials closely watching the situation here. Earlier this
week, health officials in Massachusetts confirmed the presence of the virus
in a dead bird found in a Boston city park. In New York state, the virus
had not spread north of Ulster County [this is an outdated assessment in
view of the isolate from Saratoga Springs -Mod.ES.
So far, there is no reason to believe the virus is present in the local
mosquito population, Novick said. Tests on about 200 pools of mosquitoes
collected this summer showed no evidence of West Nile virus. Onondaga
County and most Central New York health departments began a surveillance
program for the virus this summer, collecting dead birds and sending them
to the state's Wildlife Pathology Laboratory and state Health Department
lab for testing. Since the beginning of the mosquito season, the Onondaga
County Health Department received 60 calls about dead birds, said Robert
Burdick, the county's environmental health director. As a result of those
calls, 30 birds were collected and sent to the state laboratories. Eighteen
of the dead birds sent for testing were crows. At 1 p.m. Friday, state
health officials called Novick's office to confirm the West Nile virus had
infected a young crow found dead July 17 on Tamarack Street in Liverpool.
Because the crow had only recently left the nest, health officials said it
is highly unlikely the bird flew into Onondaga County from another area
where the virus has been detected.
Pirro said the county has experience in dealing with mosquito-borne
diseases because Eastern equine encephalitis is endemic to Cicero Swamp.
The county operates an annual mosquito testing and surveillance program for
EEE virus, a rare but sometimes deadly virus. Only two case of EEE have
been confirmed in the past 30 years in Central New York - one that resulted
in the death of a 7-year-old Onondaga County boy in 1983 and another case
that killed a 2-year-old Oswego County boy in 1973. When the West Nile
virus made its entry into the United States in New York City last summer,
state health officials turned to Onondaga County's experts for help.
Several members of the county health department traveled to Queens to help
set up a mosquito surveillance program for the new virus. Novick said it is
unlikely the test result gave a false reading for the presence of the virus
in the Liverpool crow. The dead crow's heart, spleen and kidney were each
tested twice to confirm the infection with West Nile, he said.

West Nile virus creeps into 4 U.S. States
--------------------------------------------
The potentially deadly West Nile virus has been discovered creeping across
the northeastern United States as New Jersey became the 4th state affected
by the mosquito-borne virus. The New Jersey State Department of Health and
Senior Services acknowledged late Friday discovering 9 dead crows, which
had tested positive for the virus. About 2 dozen people showing symptoms
[similar to St. Louis encephalitis, which can be caused by the West Nile
virus, underwent blood testing, according to a statement issued by the
department. "All results reported to date have been negative," assured the
document.
Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, where no virus has been discovered, have
launched preventive public awareness programs.
Similar outbreaks of West Nile virus-triggered encephalitis have also
occurred in Algeria in 1994, in Romania in 1996 and 1997 and in the Czech
Republic in 1997, according to the US Center for Disease Control and
Prevention.

Canadian Government issues West Nile virus alert
-----------------------------------------
In an effort to protect Canadians against West Nile virus, Health Canada is
advising tourists travelling to the U.S. to beware of mosquitoes. The
Laboratory Centre for Disease Control says people travelling to areas of
New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and Massachusetts should go armed with
mosquito repellent and dress in skin-shielding, light-coloured clothes. It
also advises people to stay in well-screened or enclosed, air-conditioned
areas.
The advisory comes one day after authorities discovered the mosquito-borne
virus had moved into Massachusetts, where it was detected in 2 dead birds
late last week. While the virus hasn't affected any people yet this year --
and has never appeared in Canada -- it has been found in mosquitoes and
birds in 5 northern states. West Nile virus first appeared in North America
in New York last year, where it was blamed for 7 deaths and infections of
55 others. While the virus poses little threat to most healthy people, in
rare cases, it can cause encephalitis, a deadly swelling of the brain. It
is spread by mosquitoes which bite infected birds, though the birds
themselves cannot spread the virus. Despite protests from some residents,
New York officials began a regular regimen of insecticide spraying.
Officials in Boston followed suit when a dead crow was found to be carrying
the virus. New York also has a 24-hour toll-free information line on West
Nile virus.
In Canada, the much-publicized posse of sentinel chickens patrol
mosquito-infested areas along the border. From Saskatchewan to Atlantic
Canada, the hens act as an early warning system by way of mosquito bait.
Researchers take weekly blood samples from the birds looking for telltale
West Nile antibodies. Chickens -- like sparrows and pigeons -- don't get
sick from West Nile virus but can carry the disease. Health Canada strongly
recommends an insect repellent using DEET, saying a repellent containing 33
per cent of the toxin should provide 8 hours of protection, though it goes
on to list various health hazards associated with DEET, including seizures
in children.
