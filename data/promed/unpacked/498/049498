China reported 3 more cases of human infection with a new strain of bird flu [avian A/(H7N9) influenza virus] on Sunday [7 Apr 2013], raising the total number of cases to 21. 6 of those who contracted the H7N9 virus have died. All 21 cases have been reported in the eastern part of the country. Health officials believe people are contracting the virus through direct contact with infected fowl and say there's no evidence the virus is spreading easily between people.

China's official Xinhua News Agency reported 2 new cases in Shanghai and one in east China's Anhui Province on Sunday [7 Apr 2013], citing local authorities.

Shanghai has been ordered by the agriculture ministry to halt its live poultry trade and slaughter all fowl in markets where the virus has been found. The capital cities of the neighboring provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu also have suspended sales of live poultry. Both provinces have reported H7N9 cases.

[It is presumed that these three new cases include the 2 cases previously described in ProMED post: "Avian influenza, human (32): China (SH, AH) H7N9 archive no. 20130407.1628294". This press report, therefore identifies one additional case in Shanghai. The tally of confirmed cases now becomes 21 with the number of fatalities remaining 6. Confirmation of the current incidence and death toll from the local Chinese authorities would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
