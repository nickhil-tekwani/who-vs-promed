CDC is collaborating with public health officials in several states and the FDA to investigate a multistate outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ O157 (STEC [or EHEC] O157) infections. Preliminary results from this ongoing investigation indicate that Wegmans brand Organic Spinach and Spring Mix blend produced by State Garden of Chelsea, Massachusetts, is one likely source of this outbreak.

Public health investigators are using DNA "fingerprints" of _E. coli_ bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. They are using data from PulseNet, the national subtyping network made up of state and local public health laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories that performs molecular surveillance of foodborne infections.

The type of bacterium responsible for this outbreak is among those referred to as Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC) [or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC)] . EHEC bacteria are grouped by serogroups (such as, O157 or O145). The EHEC serogroup found most commonly in USA patients is _E. coli_ O157.

A total of 28 ill persons infected with the outbreak strain of serotype O157:H7 have been reported from 5 states. The number of ill people identified in each state with the outbreak strain is as follows: Connecticut (2), Massachusetts (2), New York (22), Pennsylvania (1), and Virginia (1).

Among persons for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from 18 Oct 2012 to 3 Nov 2012. Ill persons range in age from 4 years to 66 years, with a median age of 24 years. 68 percent of ill persons are female. Among 24 ill persons with available information, 10 (42 percent) reported being hospitalized. 2 ill persons have developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure. No deaths have been reported.

This PFGE pattern has very rarely been seen before in PulseNet. It has been seen only 7 times prior to this outbreak. Illnesses that occurred after 30 Oct 2012 might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
State public health officials are interviewing ill persons to obtain information regarding foods they might have eaten and other exposures in the week before illness. The outbreak was initially confined to New York, where preliminary information indicated that Wegmans brand Organic Spinach and Spring Mix blend was one likely source for illnesses, leading to a recall of this product on 2 Nov 2012. Since that time, more ill persons in other states have been reported, and the investigation has expanded.

24 (100 percent) of 24 ill persons reported eating pre-packaged leafy greens. In New York, 13 (81 percent) of 16 ill persons for whom we have information report eating Wegmans brand Organic Spinach and Spring Mix blend in the week before becoming ill. Outside of New York, all 5 (100 percent) of the ill persons interviewed in other states report eating several different brands of pre-packaged leafy greens that did not come from Wegmans. Investigations are ongoing to determine if other contaminated foods are also a source of illness in this outbreak.

Testing conducted by the NY Department Health Wadsworth Center Laboratories isolated the outbreak strain of serotype O157:H7 from 4 leftover packages of Wegmans brand Organic Spinach and Spring Mix blend collected from the ill persons' homes.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview ill persons about foods eaten before becoming ill. FDA is continuing to work closely with CDC and state partners during this investigation. CDC will update the public on the progress of this investigation as information becomes available.

[ProMED-mail has previously posted regarding the initial part of this cluster, when all of the cases were located in New York State. The cluster has now grown to affect 5 states in total to this point. "Smoking" spinach has been identified, that is, the identical organism has been isolated from both patient and vehicle. - Mod.LL]
