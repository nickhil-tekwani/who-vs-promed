Cholera - Togo
--------------
From 11 Nov [2020] to 28 Dec [2020], a total of 67 suspected cholera cases presenting with diarrhea and vomiting, including 2 deaths (CFR 3%), were reported from the municipalities "Golfe 1" and "Golfe 6" in Lome, Togo. A total of 4 health areas (Katanga, Adakpame, Gbetsogbe in Golfe 1, and Kangnikope in Golfe 6) in the affected municipalities reported at least one case.

On 17 Nov [2020], cholera was confirmed by culture in the laboratory of the National Institute of Hygiene (INH) in Lome, Togo, and WHO was informed. On 19 Nov [2020], the Minister of Health, Public Hygiene and Universal Access to Care of Togo issued a press release declaring a cholera outbreak, and on 24 Nov [2020], WHO was officially notified. From 11 Nov [2020] to 28 Dec [2020], a total of 17 out of 41 stool samples tested positive for _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 serotype Ogawa by culture in the National Institute of Hygiene (INH) in Lome, Togo.

The daily number of cases peaked on 16 Nov [2020] with 6 cases, including one death. Then, after a decrease in the number of daily cases, they once again peaked with 6 cases reported on both 16 and 22 Dec [2020]. The cases with symptom onset between 11 and 15 Nov [2020] were found retrospectively by active case searches in health facilities from consultation registers. Of the 67 cases, 19 (28%) were fishermen who move frequently between Togo and neighboring countries (especially Ghana, Benin, and Nigeria). The male / female ratio is 1.48 (40 males and 27 females) with an average age of 24 years.

Public health response
----------------------
Full response is ongoing in Lome, including but not limited to:
- Implementation of the outbreak response plan is in progress
- Strengthening of active surveillance: briefing of health workers and community health workers, active case finding
- Hygiene promotion in the community
- Case management
- Strengthening of infection prevention and control in health facilities
- Distribution of water treatment products (chlorine tabs) to the population
- Installation of drinking water tanks for distribution to the population
- Disinfection of the homes of the cases
- Risk communication and community engagement
- Coordination meetings
- Sample taking at water points for biochemical and bacteriological analysis

The possibility of an oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaign is under discussion.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
Cholera is an acute enteric infectious disease caused by ingesting water or food contaminated with _V. cholerae_ bacteria. Cholera is a potentially serious disease, causing high rates of morbidity and mortality in the absence of timely treatment. Due to the short incubation period of cholera, outbreaks can develop rapidly depending on the frequency of exposure, the population exposed, and the context involved.

Cholera outbreaks have previously occurred in Togo with the last outbreak reported in 2016. The city of Lome, currently affected by the outbreak, is one of the known hotspots for cholera. In addition, Togo borders countries where this disease is endemic. A cholera outbreak in the Togolese capital, Lome, with a population estimated at around of 2 million, has so far amounted to 67 suspected cholera cases including 2 deaths (CFR 3%), of which 17 have been confirmed by culture between 11 Nov [2020] and 28 Dec [2020].

The currently affected health zones (Katanga, Adakpame, Gbetsogbe and Kangnikope) are mostly located in port areas with poor hygiene and sanitation conditions. Strong response activities are necessary to prevent the possible spread, given the fishing activities carried out in the affected localities that attract inhabitants from several districts of Lome and other regions of Togo as well as Lome's proximity to Ghana and Benin. One imported confirmed cholera case and one 2ary case were reported in the Netherlands in travelers from Togo. The index case was infected in Togo and, upon return to the Netherlands, tested positive for cholera on 17 Nov [2020]. The partner of the index case developed cholera-like symptoms including "rice water" diarrhea and vomiting and is considered to have acquired the disease through 2ary transmission via the index. Even though there is no risk for further spread of the disease in the Netherlands, this event represents an international spread.

Togolese health authorities have been implementing all necessary response measures; nevertheless, the possibility of exportation of additional cases to other countries cannot be excluded.

With the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is a risk of disruption to health-care access due to both COVID-19-related burden on the health system and health-care workers and a decreased demand because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance.

Another aspect to take into consideration during the current COVID-19 pandemic is the capacity of the local and national reference laboratories to handle cholera testing due to the overdemand in processing COVID-19 samples. As of 3 Jan [2021], Togo reported 3683 COVID-19 cases with 68 deaths.

WHO advice
----------
Suspected cholera cases are detected based on clinical suspicion in patients who present with severe acute watery diarrhea in at-risk areas, areas with ongoing cholera transmission, or in persons who have travelled to areas with ongoing transmission. Detection can be facilitated using cholera rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs); confirmation is made by culture or PCR. Proper and timely case management in dedicated cholera treatment centers (CTCs), improving access to potable water and sanitation infrastructure, and improved hygiene and food safety practices in affected communities are the most effective means of controlling cholera. Key public health communication messages should be provided to modify behavioral practices, including handwashing, to contain the spread of the disease.

WHO advises against any restriction to travel to and trade with the international community based on the information available on the current outbreak.

[2] Cholera - Mozambique (Cabo Delgado)
Date: Wed 6 Jan 2021

A cholera outbreak in the northern Mozambican province of Cabo Delgado has spread to Montepuez district, so far claiming one life out of 11 confirmed cases that have checked into the local cholera treatment centre, according to a report in Wednesday's [6 Jan 2021] issue of independent daily "O Pais." The latest records have led the provincial authorities to declare a cholera outbreak in Montepuez. There were already 5 districts grappling with the disease, namely Mocimboa da Praia, Macomia, Ibo, Metuge, and the provincial capital, Pemba.

Addressing a press conference on Tuesday [5 Jan 2021], the secretary of state for Cabo Delgado, Armindo Ngunga, confirmed the Montepuez outbreak after the health authorities had confirmed more than 200 cases of acute diarrhea.

"Laboratory surveillance to determine the root causes for diarrhea enabled us to confirm one positive case of cholera on 20 Dec [2020]. On 2 Jan [2021], a 2nd positive case was confirmed, thus meeting the conditions for declaring an outbreak in Montepuez," Ngunga said. The provincial government, Ngunga added, is profoundly concerned with the spread of the disease to Montepuez. "From January 2020 until last night [5 Jan 2021], 2125 cases have been confirmed across the province with 37 deaths. The lethality rate is 1.7%," Ngunga said.

The cholera outbreak was first reported from Ibo Island and swiftly spread to Pemba and to Metuge district. A few weeks later, the disease was reported in Macomia and Mocimboa da Praia. But these are among the districts worst hit by Islamist terrorism, and so there is no accurate data available about the outbreak. To make matters even worse, the residents have no access to health care because the attacks have closed down most health units in these districts.

The increase in the number of cases and the rapid spread have occurred despite the mass immunization drives undertaken earlier in 2020. It is estimated that over 10 000 people received 2 doses of the cholera vaccine, which, according to the Ministry of Health, provides immunity for about 2 years.

[3] Cholera - Somalia
Date: Mon 4 Jan 2021
Source: ReliefWeb [a WHO News and Press Release] [edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/outbreak-update-cholera-somalia-27-december-2020


The Ministry of Health of Somalia has announced 64 new suspected cases of cholera, with no reported death, for epidemiological week 52 [21-27 Dec 2020]. The cumulative total number of suspected cholera cases since the beginning of the year [2020] is 6589, including 33 associated deaths (CFR 0.5%). In 2020, active transmission was reported from the regions of Banadir, Bay, Hiran, and lower Shabele. The last cholera cases in Jowhar district of middle Shabelle were reported in week 17 [20-26 Apr 2020]. Of the 6589 reported cases, 3036 (46%) are aged 2 years and below, while 18 (55%) of the 33 registered deaths are aged 2 years and below.

The current cholera outbreak started in December 2017 following floods that affected districts in the basins of Jubba and Shabelle rivers. It was contained in 5 of the 6 regions, while active transmission has continued to be reported from Banadir. Flash floods caused by heavy Gu rains in April 2020 led to the contamination of water sources that led to an increase in the number of cholera cases in Banadir (4037 cases), Hiran (948 cases), Middle Shabelle (560 cases), Bay (935 cases), and Lower Shabelle (109 cases). Of the 33 deaths reported since week 1 of 2020, 20 (65%) were reported in Banadir region.

Of the 587 stool samples tested since January 2020, a total of 175 samples came out positive for _V. cholerae_, serotype Inaba was isolated from stool samples collected from Baidoa. This strain was sensitive to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and ciprofloxacin.

The overall reduction in the number of new cholera cases as compared to the numbers at the beginning of the outbreak is attributed to improved implementation of preventive interventions including oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaigns and the strengthening of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) activities in hot spots. However, the current floods and cholera outbreak occurred at a time when COVID-19 cases are increasing in all regions of Somalia, stretching the already limited capacity to respond to the cholera alerts.

WHO continues to provide leadership and support to health authorities and partners in implementing activities that can mitigate the outbreak. Disease surveillance is being managed with the support of WHO through an electronic system known as the early warning alert and response network (EWARN) and is currently being expanded to all health facilities across the country. WHO and the Ministry of Health continue to monitor outbreak trends through EWARN and promptly investigate and respond to all alerts.

[As a review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _V. cholerae_ are shared with many water vibrios and therefore are of no use in distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic) antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139 known serogroups. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are nonvirulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which is "non-O1"), a single serogroup, designated O1, has been responsible for epidemic cholera.

There are 3 distinct O1 serotypes -- Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima -- each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype (or biotype). The biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A, B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba contains antigens A and C; and Hikojima contains antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare. - Mod.LL]
