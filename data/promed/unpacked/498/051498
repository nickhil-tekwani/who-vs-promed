Five persons have been hospitalized with anthrax in Kyrgyzstan. The
Kyrgyz Republican Centre of Quarantine & Especially Dangerous
Infections has reported that all 5 persons are inhabitants of the
Zhayilsky district in the Chuyskaya oblast.

They were infected during the necessary [?] slaughter and butchering
of sick animals. It has been established that the cutaneous form of
anthrax affected these 5 individuals.

These are not the 1st cases of anthrax, and the situation with this
disease remains complicated due to the 1260 ground foci of past
infections and the large number of unascertained or lost places of
mortality and burial sites of sick animals. Also, there is a low
level of disease prophylaxis among domestic animals. In all, 27 cases
of anthrax have been registered this year [2008] in Kyrgyzstan.
