Jordan reported its 1st human case of bird flu on Friday in an Egyptian
labourer who was believed to have become infected while on a holiday in his
hometown in Egypt, health officials said. Health Minister Said Darwazeh
said the man, a 31 year old labourer, who had lived in Jordan for 3 years,
had been taken to hospital on Thursday after suffering severe breathing
problems 3 days after arriving from his home town in Fayoum where people
had been in close contact with infected poultry.
"His condition is good and (he is) getting treatment and we are
coordinating with the Egyptian authorities," Darwazeh told Reuters, adding
that preliminary tests showed there were no other cases.
Jordan became the latest country in the Middle East to confirm cases of the
deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu this week but had said no humans had been
infected and the outbreak was under control.
Egypt has reported bird flu infections in five people in recent weeks, 2 of
whom died.

Indonesia's 23rd bird flu fatality has been confirmed by tests carried out
by the World Health Organization (WHO), while local tests showed another
patient is infected.
"We have just received the results and they are positive," the health
ministry's I Nyoman Kandun told AFP, referring to tests of samples from the
23rd victim, a one year old girl from the capital Jakarta. The girl died
just over a week ago at Indonesia's main hospital for bird flu patients,
Sulianti Saroso, after coming into contact with sick chickens near her house.
"We also received information today that an adult patient in West Sumatra
has tested positive," Kandun said on Friday, adding that the patient was a
23 year old man. "He's still alive and being treated in Padang," the
capital of West Sumatra province, he added. The official did not know his
condition.
Local tests for the deadly H5N1 virus, which are usually accurate, are
routinely sent to WHO-affiliated laboratories in Hong Kong or the United
States for confirmation. Indonesia has witnessed more bird flu deaths than
any other country this year, recording 12 fatalities. It has the second
highest number of fatalities reported in the world since 2003, after Vietnam.
Most cases here have been in the capital and its surroundings, where many
people live in close proximity to poultry despite the urban environment,
but infected birds have been found in 26 of Indonesia's 33 provinces. The
most recent previous fatalities were confirmed on 10 Mar 2006. They were
also children, aged 3 and 12 years.
Health authorities have already warned that they would be ill-equipped to
deal with a pandemic in the sprawling archipelago nation.

[3] Azerbaijan, suspected

Local scientists have found a strain of bird flu in a 16 year old girl from
a family in Azerbaijan which has lost 3 members to the H5N1 virus, deputy
health minister Abbas Velibeyov said on Thursday. "To confirm the presence
of the virus, we intend to send samples to the laboratory in London. But
clinical observation shows this girl has bird flu," Velibeyov told Reuters.
Of 5 young people who have died from bird flu in Azerbaijan, 3 are from the
Askerov family. But the girl, who is now in hospital, is the first new case
of suspected infection since the first week of March 2006. Velibeyov said
the girl had probably caught the virus via the same route as her other
family members, who are thought to have been infected while plucking
feathers from dead swans. The World Health Organisation has said in the
past it believes the Azeri laboratory is reliable but it also sends samples
to a WHO-accredited laboratory in Britain for confirmation.
