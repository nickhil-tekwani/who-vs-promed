In 2009, 1422 [dengue] cases have been recorded compared to 1058 in all
of last year [2008]. The number of dengue cases recorded in Ribeirao
Preto up to 3 Sep [2009] are now more than in all of last year [2008].
During the period of greatest incidence -- February - May 2009 -- this
year's total surpasses that of 2008: 1265 versus 830.

The Division of Vector Control developed a work time line based in
Breteau Indices (BI), starting in July 2009. The BI was 1.86, which
places Ribeirao Preto in a state of risk. The World Health Organization
recognizes an index of less than 1 as ideal.

According to the Chief of Vector Control, Cristina OZGrady Lima, the
arrival of influenza A [H1N1] has distracted the people's attention,
and dengue [virus infections] can also lead to death. People only care
about the flu. Wash hands, use alcohol gel against dengue, she says.
The Medical Division, Rosana Maria do Rosario, warns that just fever is
a symptom in the 2 diseases. "A good differential is a cough, which
exists only in cases of influenza."

Cristina says she does not condemn people for their lack of concern,
but remember that dengue can also kill, especially in Ribeirao, where 3
of the 4 [dengue serotypes] viruses of the disease [circulate]. Now
with the winter rainy season, the concern with [dengue] prevention has
increased.

The work to combat mosquito breeding sites began last week and provides
action by agents in 13 districts of the city, with operations in
September and October 2009. The East Zone has several neighborhoods
with infestation rates that are considered high. Cristina says that now
is the time for prevention because it is the inter-epidemic period.
"When there is no transmission, people are careless. This is a fact
related to education. But if the eggs stay in the containers, they will
become larvae and mosquitoes with arrival of the rains."

Guatemalan health officials on Tuesday [15 Sep 2009] confirmed that 2
people have died from DHF in the Caribbean province of Izabal, where
there were reports that at least 8 children died from the disease in
the past few weeks. An investigation conducted last week [week of 13
Sep 2009] confirmed that at least 2 people died from the disease in the
region, the Health Ministry said.

Dengue is a serious viral disease transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito that is characterized by high fever, intense headaches, muscle
pain, gastrointestinal problems and rashes. DHF, in addition to having
symptoms associated with classic dengue, like fever, headaches and
joint pain, can also produce internal bleeding.

Opposition GANA party Congressman Byron Chacon, who represents Izabal,
said last Thursday [17 Sep 2009] that 8 children had died from DHF and
69 other people were infected with the disease in his district. Health
Minister Celso Cerezo said, however, that 2 people had died and 16
others had been infected with [developed] DHF, but they were all
recovering.

A total of 115 cases of classic dengue have also been detected in
Izabal, health officials said. Dengue is common in Izabal, which does
not have drains, allowing the mosquitoes that spread the disease to
breed in standing water.

El Salvador health authorities have reported 2431 cases of classic
dengue in the 1st 8 months of the year [2009], about 153 percent more
than the same period last year [2008], according to news reaching here
on Thursday [17 Sep 2009].

There were 45 cases of the deadlier DHF, 18 more than the same period
last year [2008]. The increase was "considerable" compared with 2008,
but close to the levels in 2006, the Health Ministry's coordinator of
epidemiology, Lilian Cruz, told media in San Salvador, capital of the
country.

Carried by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito which breeds in stagnant water,
and with no known cure, dengue causes severe pain in bones, muscles and
joints, as well as headaches, fever and a rash.

Currently, there are [all] 4 types of this virus circulating in El
Salvador, while there were only 2 in 2007 and 2008, when levels of
infection were comparatively low.

World Health Organization studies indicate that patients are more
likely to be infected with DHF, the deadliest variant of the disease,
when they are twice infected by the disease, with a strain the body has
not fought before. DHF kills around 20 percent of its infections if it
goes untreated, according to the studies.

El Salvador already reported 3 dengue deaths: a 19-year-old man, and 2
new-born babies.

In order to alert the public about the seriousness of the disease, the
country's Health Ministry has designated 26 Aug 2009 as its national
anti-dengue day.

Keys health officials say they've confirmed 3 Key West cases of dengue
fever, a mosquito-borne viral illness characterized by a flat red body
rash, fatigue, nausea and joint aches. "Everyone who was ill has fully
recovered," says Bob Eadie, administrator of the Monroe County Health
Department. "Dengue is rare in Florida, but not unknown. It's just one
of several mosquito-borne illnesses monitored by the department and why
we continually remind the public to take precautions against mosquito
bites." Eadie says dengue is hardly rare -- more than 100 million cases
were reported worldwide last year [2008]. But it's rare in Florida.

The department said one of the Key West cases, involving a New York
tourist, was the 1st locally acquired case of dengue reported in the
state in more than 40 years.

The state Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention are sending a team to Key West this weekend to interview
residents and take blood samples in an effort to identify the specific
serotype of the virus and to determine its place of origin. And the
Florida Keys Mosquito Control District has increased aerial and ground
spraying, and environmental surveys. Director Ed Fussell says staffers
also are going door to door identifying potential mosquito breeding
sites.

<http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/220598/dengue-outbreak-ifugao-kalinga>


The Cordillera office of the Department of Health (DoH) recently
declared a dengue outbreak in Lagawe, Ifugao and Bulanao, Kalinga due
to the sudden increase in the number of cases in the 2 areas, reaching
527 cases since January this year [2009]. With the outbreak and the
rising cases of dengue in other areas, President Arroyo ordered health
agencies and local governments to link arms to protect the people from
mosquito-borne disease. Despite the dengue outbreak in Ifugao and
Kalinga, Dr. Myrna Cabotaje, DoH-CAR regional director, said the
situations in the 2 Cordillera towns are now under control.

In Ifugao, a total of 127 dengue fever cases, including 4 outside the
province, were admitted at the Ifugao provincial hospital and other
health units for the 1st 35 weeks of this year [2009]. She revealed
there were 2 deaths, including 2 children, registered in the province
as a result of the dengue [virus]-carrying mosquito which resulted in
the spread of the disease. In Tabuk, Kalinga, 400 dengue fever cases
were documented by health authorities for the 1st 35 weeks of this
year, prompting the DoH-CAR to declare an outbreak in the area over the
past several weeks.

In general, Cabotaje said that there were a total of 833 dengue fever
cases recorded in the region for the 1st 35 weeks, an increase by 28
percent compared to the 648 cases for the same period last year [2008].
At the same time, the number of dengue cases recorded this year
compared to the same period last year noticeably increased from 52
cases to 124 cases in Benguet.

Cabotaje said dengue outbreaks are declared in a certain area when the
number of cases within the same period in the current year goes beyond
the expected range. She explained the so-called range is computed as
the average number of cases within the period of 3 - 5 years prior to
the current year. An area is considered to be a dengue hot spot when an
increase in the number of dengue cases is observed for 3 consecutive
weeks, even if the said number is within the expected range.

Because of the outbreak, Deputy Presidential Spokesman Anthony Golez
said the President asked the DoH to intensify its public education
campaign to prevent outbreaks of dengue in homes, schools, communities
and workplaces. The President issued the directives after the health
department reported more than 16 000 people have been hospitalized due
to dengue this year [2009]. At least 165 people have reportedly died
from dengue, a tropical disease transmitted by mosquitoes.

"The President would like to stress and reiterate the need for
cooperation among the local government units, the different
communities, and national health officials in combating dengue in the
country," Golez told reporters in the Palace. "The President also
instructed the DoH to intensify the campaign against dengue,
particularly public educational programs, because dengue can be
prevented," he said.

The Antique Provincial Health Office reported 210 dengue cases and 3
deaths for the period 1 Jan - 10 Sep 2009.

Tess Vergara, Dengue Coordinator, Provincial Health Office, said that
despite a massive campaign of cleanliness and sanitation all throughout
the province, dengue mosquitoes can not be totally eradicated.

Among the age groups that have the most number of cases are ages 1-10
years old, with 103 cases, followed by 11-20 years with 65 cases, while
there are 9 cases that are below one-year-old.

The town of Tobias Fornier has the most number of cases with 59,
followed by Bugasong with 25, then San Jose with 21; 3 deaths are from
the towns of Culasi, Caluya and Barbaza.

Meanwhile, the Provincial Health Office and the Municipal Health
Offices of the 18 towns continue to campaign for peoples' participation
in the massive cleanliness and sanitation drives, particularly
undertaking search and destroy operations for breeding places of
mosquitoes in consonance with the order of President Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo to intensify the campaign against dengue through
public health educational programs.

The President, according to Deputy Spokesperson Anthony Golez, asked
local government units and national health officials to cooperate in
combating the scourge, which has claimed a number of lives in depressed
communities.

With rainy weather approaching [Viet Nam], dengue fever is entering its
peak season, the Ministry of Health said on Monday [14 Sep 2009].

Over 44 571 people have been infected this year [2009], with 37
fatalities, nearly 30 percent higher than in the same period last year
[2008].

Medical workers are worried about the large number of patients in the
capital Hanoi.

A total of 11 people in the Mekong delta provinces of Soc Trang, Bac
Lieu, and Tra Vinh died of the disease [dengue fever], with Soc Trang
alone accounting for deaths out of more than 4000 people affected.

Dr Le Minh Thuan, director of the Dam Doi-Ca Mau Medical Center in the
southern province of Ca Mau, said in the last 8 months [January-August
2009], hospitals and health centers have treated nearly 450 cases, of
whom 122 were seriously affected.

[Based on the newswire above, there were 44 571 cases and 37 deaths of
dengue infection in Viet Nam during January to 14 Sep 2009. More than
4000 people have been affected with dengue fever in Soc Trang in 2009.
Nearly 30 percent (11 out of 37 deaths) of deaths were from the Mekong
Delta provinces of Soc Trang, Bac Lieu, and Tra Vinh.

Regarding dengue outbreaks in other provinces in Viet Nam during 2009,
as of 29 Aug 2009, the Hanoi Health Department reported that nearly
2500 cases of the mosquito-borne illness had been recorded citywide
since the beginning of 2009. There were 7100 cases and 7 deaths
reported in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) (see prior ProMED-mail posting
Dengue/DHF update 2009 (35) 20090831.3065).

A dengue outbreak has been present in Hanoi province since the
beginning of August 2009, with 782 dengue cases (accounting for 91
percent of dengue cases in the north) as of 25 Aug 2009. In Hanoi, most
patients came from Hoang Mai District with 191 cases, and then Dong Da
District with 123 cases (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet Nam
(13) 20090826.3002).

As of 8 Jul 2009, the HCMC Pasteur Institute has reported 20 967 cases
of dengue fever in 20 central and southern cities and provinces from Da
Nang to Ca Mau. Of the cases, 23 have died, 7 in HCMC and the rest in
the Mekong Delta. Health authorities in Tien Giang Province have
reported an abnormal increase in dengue infections with one dead and
more than 900 patients hospitalized in the 1st 6 months of 2009.

Soc Trang Province in the delta has also reported an increase of dengue
patients, with around 150 new cases hospitalized every week recently.
In the 1st 6 months, Soc Trang admitted 2380 dengue patients to
hospitals and 5 deaths, while only 2 dengue patients died in Soc Trang
in the whole of 2008 (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet Nam (11)
20090708.2447).

According to WHO's Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WHO/WPRO)
available at <http://www.wpro.who.int/sites/mvp/data/dengue/>, there
were 96 451 cases and 97 deaths of dengue fever in Viet Nam in 2008,
and 16 655 cases and 14 deaths from January to May 2009.

<http://www.thanhniennews.com/healthy/?catid=8&newsid=52495>

The highest concentration of dengue fever cases has moved north, with
Hanoi as Viet Nam's hardest-hit area after the Mekong Delta had
accounted for 80-90 percent of all cases from 1998-2007, said a health
official.

The Hanoi Department of Health on [1 Sep 2009] reported that nearly
3000 people have had dengue over the 1st 8 months in the capital, 12
times higher than the same period of last year [2008], Vu Sinh Nam,
deputy director general of the Preventive Health and Environment
Department, told Thanh Nien in a recent interview.

Viet Nam has historically recorded major jumps in the number of dengue
cases every 10 years, he said. "Our country has recorded big dengue
outbreaks in 1987, 1998 and now 2009."

Only between 5-10 percent of local people have antibodies against
dengue fever in the north, Nam said, compared to 70-85 percent in the
south.

This, together with the Hanoi's failure to kill mosquito larvae
thoroughly, can explain dengue's abnormal increase this year [2009] in
Hanoi, according to the official, denying that a new strain of dengue
virus was the cause of the outbreaks. "At the moment, scientific
evidence has yet to prove a change in the virus strain."

However, the health ministry is tracing the appearance of another
mosquito-borne virus, chikungunya, which is suspected of causing an
illness with symptoms similar to dengue fever in many patients, Nam
said.

Vaccines against dengue fever are now under experiment, Nam said,
adding that new dengue tests that confirm the finding in 3 days as
opposed to the current 5 have been proposed.

While the number of dengue patients this year [2009] has not increased
much from last year [2008] in Ho Chi Minh City [HCMC], experts said the
peak had yet to come.

"The dengue fever outbreak has not peaked but will start increasing
critically later this month [September 2009]," said Nguyen Dac Tho,
vice director of the HCMC Preventive Health Department.

Dr Le Bich Lien, head of the Dengue Fever Department at the city's
Children's Hospital No. 1, also warned that the dengue attack would get
stronger and last till December [2009].

Since the beginning of the year [2009], 1720 people have been admitted
to hospitals with dengue, according to official statistics from the
local health sector. Eight of them have died, double last year's [2008]
toll, the statistics showed.

[Dengue is transmitted by the bite of an _Aedes_ mosquito infected with
any one of the 4 dengue viruses. Symptoms range from a mild fever to
incapacitating high fever, with severe headache, pain behind the eyes,
muscle and joint pain, and rash. Dengue haemorrhagic fever (fever,
abdominal pain, vomiting, bleeding) is a potentially lethal
complication, affecting mainly children (see
<http://www.who.int/topics/dengue/en/>).

As of 14 Sep 2009, over 44 571 people in Viet Nam have been infected
with dengue virus in 2009, with 37 fatalities. Nearly 30 percent (11
out of 37 deaths) of deaths were from the Mekong Delta provinces of Soc
Trang, Bac Lieu, and Tra Vinh (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet
Nam (14) 20090916.3245).

According to the head of the Health Ministry's Preventive Medicine and
Environment Department, Nguyen Huy Nga, "Dengue fever cases were up in
Hanoi (as many as 700 people in Hanoi are affected by dengue fever
every week) because of the increased population density and rampant
construction." Between January and August 2009, the city saw 2985
dengue fever cases, and all of the districts in the city had had dengue
fever patients. This is 10 times higher than the same period of 2008
(see <http://english.Vietnamnet.vn/Health/2009/09/868997/>).

According to Dr Phan Van Nghiem from HCMC's health department, as of 29
Aug 2009, although the number of dengue cases recorded in HCMC has not
increased sharply in the 1st 8 months of 2009, more patients have
reached critical condition, and there have been more deaths related to
dengue. Over 7100 cases and 7 fatalities have been recorded citywide
since the beginning of 2009 (see prior ProMED-mail posting Dengue/DHF
update 2009 (35) 20090831.3065).

According to the GIDEON (Global Infectious Disease & Epidemiology
Network) website, there were large outbreaks of dengue hemorrhagic
fever (DHF) in Viet Nam in 1987 and 1998, with 354 517 cases and 234
920 cases, respectively. During January to October 1998, most cases
were reported in the Mekong Delta region; 15.8 percent from Ben Tre,
and 10.5 percent from Quang Tri. Phu Yen Province reported 3354 cases
with 11 fatalities during January to July [1998].

As the rainy season in Viet Nam is from May to October, it is possible
that the number of dengue cases and deaths in 2009 will continue to
increase until the end of October 2009.

Health officials at the Candolim Primary Health Centre stepped up
measures to curb the spread of dengue in the area. The action follows
the death of a 6-year-old boy from Calangute.

PHC Health Officer Dr Govekar said, "Besides other measures, we checked
for stagnant water at the construction sites in the area. However, we
did not observe much stagnant water, which may have been a cause for
concern."

While these measures are being carried out in the area of the boy's
residence in Naikawaddo, Calangute, this is merely a reactionary move.
What is called for is a pro-active move to check the unsanitary
conditions prevailing in the entire Calangute area where widespread
mosquito breeding is a major cause for concern.

The dengue count in Goa has gone up to 49 with one death.
