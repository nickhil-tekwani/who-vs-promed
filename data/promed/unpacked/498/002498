The first results of tests on cattle in County Tyrone suspected of having
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) have proved negative. The news on Thursday
morning came a day after the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture
said it was investigating what it called a "hot suspect" case on a cattle
farm near Cookstown.
Northern Ireland's only FMD outbreak so far was in a sheep flock at Meigh
in south Armagh on 1 Mar 2001. More than 2000 animals in surrounding farms
were slaughtered immediately after the Meigh outbreak.

A second case of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has been confirmed in
Northern Ireland, dashing hopes the disease had been contained in the
province. Northern Ireland agriculture minister Brid Rodgers confirmed the
case after a second set of tests on a dairy herd in County Tyrone proved
positive.
Northern Ireland's only other confirmed case of the disease was on a farm
at Meigh in South Armagh, nearly 50 miles away from the second case.
Meanwhile, UK Agriculture Minister Nick Brown says he is again considering
the possibility of vaccinating animals in areas worst affected by FMD.
Ministers have already admitted the program of killing animals in affected
areas is running behind schedule, with 541 000 animals awaiting slaughter
and 400 000 carcasses awaiting disposal. Vaccination has so far been ruled
out, but Mr Brown said he "was attracted to the idea" of vaccinating in
badly hit areas such as Devon and Cumbria, where there have been 655 cases
- out of a UK total of 1289 - since the start of the outbreak.
Mr Brown said he was considering vaccination in order to save the lives of
some animals in badly hit areas. There is strong opposition in some parts
of the farming community because of future effects on the industry as areas
with vaccinated animals would not be labeled "disease free".
There are fears a European Union ban on meat exports from Northern Ireland,
which had been lifted, will be reimposed.

Northern Ireland's agriculture minister Brid Rodgers has confirmed the
discovery of another hot suspect case of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in
the province.
The suspect case in County Antrim comes less than 24 hours after secondary
tests on a dairy herd at Ardboe in County Tyrone proved positive. More than
4000 animals are being slaughtered in the vicinity of the Tyrone farm where
the province's second outbreak of the disease occurred.
However, 40 cattle and 200 sheep at the suspect case in Cushendall are also
being destroyed in a precautionary cull. That farm has been cordoned off
and tests are being carried out on animals which are displaying lesions
consistent with the virus.
A second case of the livestock disease in the province led to the
reimposition of a European Union ban on meat and dairy exports. The only
other case was confirmed on 1 Mar 2001 on a farm at Meigh in south Armagh,
nearly 50 miles away from the second case.
Mrs Rodgers said all pigs within a 3 km zone and all sheep and cattle in a
1 km zone would be slaughtered. "As far as disposal of carcasses of the
slaughtered animals is concerned, all those from the infected farm will be
incinerated on the site."
Initial test results from the Cookstown herd had been negative, but Mrs
Rodgers said officials from her department were now viewing it as "a
positive case". Samples from these animals will be sent to Pirbright
Laboratory for analysis.
President of the Ulster Farmers' Union Douglas Rowe said the province had
now lost its disease-free regionalisation status for at least the next 30
days, or longer if there were further cases.
Meanwhile, vets from the Department of Agriculture have said they are
mystified as to how the virus got to the Arboe area. They are appealing for
information which could help them trace the source of the infection.
