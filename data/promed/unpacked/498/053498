More than 1000 buffaloes [_Syncerus caffer_] have died in Landhi's
Cattle Colony after consuming poisonous fodder over the past 3 days,
dairy farmers claimed here on Tuesday [27 Nov 2007].

Karachi Dairy Farmers Association Joint Secretary Shaukat Mukhtar
said initial investigations revealed that the stale bread and bran
given to the animals was poisonous.

He said paralysis, severe constipation, heavy salivation and
shivering with absolutely no more intake were some of the major
complaints. Paralysis showed that the poison had affected their
central nervous systems, he said.

When asked whether dairy and cattle farmers had sought medical
examination of the affected buffaloes at any laboratory, he said
there was no such lab in the colony. He said cattle farmers mostly
used traditional methods to treat their herds. There was a veterinary
hospital in Cattle Colony, though it did not have a laboratory
facility, he added.

[I am unsure what type of bread these animals were fed, but an
overdose of carbohydrates could cause acidosis and cause the animals
to salivate. However, that does not account for the paralysis or
constipation. Although this article does not mention water, the
blue-green algae species would not cause these clinical signs either.
Mycotoxins in the fodder would not cause these signs either. Without
more information, this becomes an exercise in speculation.
