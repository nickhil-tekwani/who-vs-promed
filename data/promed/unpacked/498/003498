For the scientists who have spent the past year poring over hundreds of thousands of coronavirus genomes, the United States has been an enigma. Despite having world-leading genome sequencing infrastructure and experiencing more COVID infections than any other country, the United States has until recently lagged far behind in sequencing coronavirus genomes and spotting worrisome variants.

But in recent weeks, US researchers have identified a host of new variants, including in California, New York State, Louisiana and elsewhere. And they are continuing to ramp up SARS-CoV-2 sequencing efforts.

That has brought another challenge: making sense of the variants that are discovered. They carry potentially worrying mutations and might be becoming more common, but a dearth of data on how the variants are spreading means the threat they pose is unclear.

"It's a Wild West," says Jeremy Kamil, a virologist at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in Shreveport who co-led a team that, last month [February 2021], spotted a fast-rising variant in Louisiana, New Mexico and elsewhere. In the absence of clear data on a variant's behaviour, "it's as if there's an unofficial policy that every variant is a variant of concern until proven otherwise," says Kamil.

Part of the challenge is the decentralized nature of US coronavirus sequencing and surveillance efforts. "Right now it's individual labs or states or cities doing their part," says David Ho, a virologist at Columbia University in New York City, whose team last week identified a variant in the city with a mutation that could compromise immune responses. As a result of this piecemeal effort, states such as New York, California and Washington have contributed thousands of sequences each, while others such as Iowa, Tennessee and New Hampshire have obtained sequences from far fewer of their COVID cases.

Ho and other US researchers look enviously at the United Kingdom, where a nationwide sequencing effort -- which works closely with public-health, medical and research institutions to make sense of variants -- has generated more than 300 000 coronavirus genomes. Thanks to the fine granularity of its data, the UK effort showed in late 2020 that the variant called B.1.1.7 clearly spread faster than the circulating strains it would go on to displace; subsequent research has suggested that B.1.1.7 might be deadlier but does not compromise vaccines.

"I don't think we have anything like that," says Ho. He hopes that the US National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the federal agencies responsible for biomedical research and public health, "will get the country moving in a more concerted fashion." A CDC-led effort launched in November [2020] is aiming to sequence around 7000 samples per week -- a goal met for the 1st time in late February [2021] -- and eventually 25 000.

In the absence of clear-cut epidemiological or medical data, scientists can gauge some of a variant's potential threat by the mutations it carries. Researchers have drawn up a growing list of mutations that might boost transmission or help a virus evade immune responses, based on laboratory and epidemiological studies.

The variant that Ho's team identified in New York, also known as B.1.526, carries a notorious mutation called E484K that has been found in variants identified in South Africa and Brazil. Studies by multiple labs have shown that the E484K change -- which is in a portion of the coronavirus spike protein that recognizes host cells -- weakens the potency of antibodies that can ordinarily disable the virus. That could help explain observations that similar variants in South Africa and Brazil are behind cases of reinfection and reduced vaccine efficacy in field trials.

On the basis of those concerns, a team led by Ho and Columbia University microbiologist Anne-Catrin Uhlemann set up a surveillance network to identify viruses carrying E484K in New York City. The 1st cases of the B.1.526 variant appeared in November [2020], growing to 5% of the city's total cases in mid-January [2021] and 12% by February [2021]. In public sequencing databases, the researchers found B.1.526 up and down the northeast coast of the United States and as far away as Singapore. The notoriety of E484K also inspired a team led by Pamela Bjorkman and Anthony West, structural biologists at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, to trawl through public sequencing data, where they spotted the lineage emerging in New York.

Ho concedes that B.1.526 needs much more study. It has not yet been shown to dodge immune responses and its apparent rise in frequency may be unrelated to any biological property. "It's taken months for the UK variant [B.1.1.7] to be shown to be more transmissible and more virulent. I think we would need to do the same," he says.

Beefed-up US sequencing efforts are turning up variants with new or rarely seen mutations that are harder to make sense of. Kamil teamed up with researchers in New Mexico because they had also observed rising numbers of cases caused by a variant, which they dubbed Pelican, bearing a mutation they hadn't seen before. They identified several other variants in US sequencing data that carried a similar change. (All were given bird nicknames, including Robin, Yellowhammer and Mockingbird.)

The mutation, called Q677P, sits near a region of the spike protein that needs to snap in two to allow the viral particle to enter a host cell. Mutations in this region occur in fast-spreading variants such as B.1.1.7, but Kamil says the Pelican variant is, for now, one to watch rather than worry over. "It's too early to say with any scientific confidence that it's a particularly worrisome mutation," he says.

Last week, researchers in California raised a red flag over variants found there that carry a spike protein mutation called L452R (1). A team at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) found that a variant with the mutation was rising rapidly in one city neighbourhood, from being present in 16% of sequenced samples in November [2020] to more than half in mid-January [2021]. Another UCSF team found, in lab tests, that a variant with the L452R mutation was more infectious and less susceptible to antibodies, according to media reports.

But many researchers have expressed scepticism of the significance of the L452R variants. The mutation hasn't turned up in lab studies that have flagged several other worrisome changes, such as E484K, and the same L452R mutation has popped up elsewhere in the United States and not grown rapidly, says Jeffrey Barrett, a statistical geneticist at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Hinxton, UK. "It's probably not going to be one of these ones that is fundamentally problematic," he says. "It's a question of waiting and watching to see what happens in California and elsewhere."

While researchers try to make sense of newly discovered US variants, redoubled sequencing efforts are also turning up more cases linked to global variants of concern. So far, researchers in the United States have uncovered only a handful of cases linked to immune-evading variants identified in South Africa and Brazil. But cases of the B.1.1.7 variant identified in the United Kingdom are rising steadily -- a pattern repeated in other countries in Europe and the Middle East.

Which of these variants will predominate is anyone's guess, say researchers, but as vaccination ramps up, susceptible variants such as B.1.1.7 could dwindle, while those that can partly evade immunity might spark regional flare-ups. "I don't think we're going to have years of 'New York variants' and 'California variants'", says Barrett. Figuring out what is happening will depend not only on sequencing more samples but also on building the capacity to understand them. "The US must do a better job along these lines," says Ho.

More than 60% of all new coronavirus infections registered in France are linked to the variant first detected in Britain, French Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Thursday [4 Mar 2021] "The circulation of the virus has accelerated over the past 2 weeks and that is clearly linked to the UK variant," Castex said at a weekly COVID-19 news conference. While the virus is not rising exponentially, the health system remains under massive pressure, he added.

Around 6% of COVID-19 cases in France are from the more contagious variants first found in Brazil and South Africa, French Health Minister Olivier Veran said on Friday [5 Mar 2021]. Veran also told BFM TV that France was doing all it could to avoid a new national lockdown, although the government would keep all options open, and that there were reasons to believe France's COVID situation would improve in 4-6 weeks, as more of its population gets vaccinated against the virus.

On Thursday [4 Mar 2021], French Prime Minister Jean Castex said around 60% of French COVID-19 cases were from the variant first discovered in England.

A coronavirus variant circulating in Brazil is likely able to reinfect people who survived infections with earlier versions of the coronavirus, new data suggest. The variant that emerged in Brazil, called P.1, carries a mutation that is already known to make a variant prevalent in South Africa harder to treat with antibodies and harder to prevent with available vaccines.

New data suggest that in many recovered patients, immunity to earlier versions of the virus will not afford immunity to P.1. Researchers tested the neutralizing ability of antibodies in plasma samples taken from survivors of COVID-19 caused by earlier versions of the virus. The plasma "had 6-fold less neutralizing capacity" against the P.1 variant than against earlier virus versions, the researchers reported on Monday [1 Mar 2021] ahead of peer-review on a preprint server belonging to The Lancet journal (1). "Lower neutralization capacity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and partial immunity against new variants suggests that reinfection could occur in convalescent or even vaccinated individuals," the authors said.

In a separate paper posted on Wednesday [3 Mar 2021] on medRxiv ahead of peer review, some of the same researchers estimated that among every 100 survivors of COVID-19 due to earlier virus versions, 25 to 60 could become reinfected if exposed to the P.1 variant because their antibodies could not protect them. As of Thursday [4 Mar 2021], according to the US Centers for Disease Control [and] Prevention, there have been 13 cases of COVID-19 due to P.1 in the United States.

[D] Impact on forecast of future case level

Chris Murray, a University of Washington disease expert whose projections on COVID-19 infections and deaths are closely followed worldwide, is changing his assumptions about the course of the pandemic. Murray had until recently been hopeful that the discovery of several effective vaccines could help countries achieve herd immunity, or nearly eliminate transmission through a combination of inoculation and previous infection.

But in the last month [February 2021], data from a vaccine trial in South Africa showed not only that a rapidly spreading coronavirus variant could dampen the effect of the vaccine, it could also evade natural immunity in people who had been previously infected. "I couldn't sleep" after seeing the data, Murray, director of the Seattle-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, told Reuters. "When will it end?" he asked himself, referring to the pandemic. He is currently updating his model to account for variants' ability to escape natural immunity and expects to provide new projections as early as this week.

A new consensus is emerging among scientists, according to Reuters interviews with 18 specialists who closely track the pandemic or are working to curb its impact. Many described how the breakthrough late last year [2020] of 2 vaccines with around 95% efficacy against COVID-19 had initially sparked hope that the virus could be largely contained, similar to the way measles has been.

But, they say, data in recent weeks on new variants from South Africa and Brazil has undercut that optimism. They now believe that SARS-CoV-2 will not only remain with us as an endemic virus, continuing to circulate in communities, but will likely cause a significant burden of illness and death for years to come.

As a result, the scientists said, people could expect to continue to take measures such as routine mask-wearing and avoiding crowded places during COVID-19 surges, especially for people at high risk. Even after vaccination, "I still would want to wear a mask if there was a variant out there," Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to US President Joe Biden, said in an interview. "All you need is one little flick of a variant (sparking) another surge, and there goes your prediction" about when life gets back to normal.

Some scientists, including Murray, acknowledge that the outlook could improve. The new vaccines, which have been developed at record speed, still appear to prevent hospitalizations and death even when new variants are the cause of infection. Many vaccine developers are working on booster shots and new inoculations that could preserve a high level of efficacy against the variants. And, scientists say there is still much to be learned about the immune system's ability to combat the virus.

Already, COVID-19 infection rates have declined in many countries since the start of 2021, with some dramatic reductions in severe illness and hospitalizations among the 1st groups of people to be vaccinated.

[Murray's] institute's current forecast, which runs to 1 Jun 2021, assumes there will be an additional 62 000 US deaths and 690 000 global deaths from COVID-19 by that point. The model includes assumptions about vaccination rates as well as the transmissibility of the [variants first detected in South Africa and Brazil].

The shift in thinking among scientists has influenced more cautious government statements about when the pandemic will end. Britain last week said it expects a slow emergence from one of the world's strictest lockdowns, despite having one of the fastest vaccination drives.

US government predictions of a return to a more normal lifestyle have been repeatedly pushed back, most recently from late summer to Christmas, and then to March 2022. Israel issues "Green Pass" immunity documents to people who have recovered from COVID-19 or been vaccinated, allowing them back into hotels or theaters. The documents are valid for only 6 months because it's not clear how long immunity will last.

"What does it mean to be past the emergency phase of this pandemic?" [asked] Stefan Baral, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. While some experts have asked whether countries could completely eradicate any case of COVID-19 through vaccines and stringent lockdowns, Baral sees the goals as more modest, but still meaningful. "In my mind, it's that hospitals aren't full, the ICUs aren't full, and people aren't tragically passing," he said.

From the beginning, the new coronavirus has been a moving target. Early in the pandemic, leading scientists warned that the virus could become endemic and "may never go away," including Dr. Michael Ryan, head of the World Health Organization's emergencies programme. Yet they had much to learn, including whether it would be possible to develop a vaccine against the virus and how quickly it would mutate. Would it be more like measles, which can be kept almost entirely at bay in communities with high rates of inoculation, or flu, which infects millions globally each year?

For much of 2020, many scientists were surprised and reassured that the coronavirus had not changed significantly enough to become more transmissible, or deadly. At least a few of the scientists Reuters interviewed said even in the wake of those results, they hadn't expected the vaccines to wipe out the virus. But many told Reuters that the data raised hope within the scientific community that it would be possible to virtually eliminate COVID-19, if only the world could be vaccinated quickly enough.

"We all felt quite optimistic before Christmas with those 1st vaccines," said Azra Ghani, chair in infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial College London. "We didn't necessarily expect such high-efficacy vaccines to be possible in that 1st generation."

The optimism proved short-lived. In late December [2020], the UK warned of a new, more transmissible variant that was quickly becoming the dominant form of the coronavirus in the country. Around the same time, researchers learned of the impact of the faster-spreading variants in South Africa and in Brazil.

Phil Dormitzer, a top vaccine scientist at Pfizer, told Reuters in November [2020] that the US drugmaker's vaccine success signaled the virus was "vulnerable to immunization" in what he called "a breakthrough for humanity." By early January [2021], he acknowledged the variants heralded "a new chapter" in which companies will have to constantly monitor for mutations that could dampen the effect of vaccines.

In late January [2021], the impact on vaccines became even clearer. Novavax's clinical trial data showed its vaccine was 89% effective in a UK trial, but just 50% effective at preventing COVID-19 in South Africa. That was followed a week later by data showing the AstraZeneca PLC vaccine offered only limited protection from mild disease against the [variant first detected in South Africa].

The most recent change of heart was considerable, several of the scientists told Reuters. Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego, described it as "scientific whiplash": In December [2020], he had believed it was plausible to achieve so-called "functional eradication" of the coronavirus, similar to measles.

Now, "getting as many people vaccinated as possible is still the same answer and the same path forward as it was on 1 Dec 2020 or 1 Jan 2020," Crotty said, "but the expected outcome isn't the same."

[E] Global COVID forecast
Date: Thu 4 Feb 2021 20:32 EST
Source: Cision PR Newswire [edited]
https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ihme-extends-covid-19-forecasts-to-june-1--predicting-over-3-5-million-deaths-globally-301222821.html


The latest COVID-19 forecasts from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington School of Medicine predict more than 3.5 million deaths globally by 1 Jun 2021. The United States is expected to see a death toll of 631 000 by 1 Jun 2021. Increasing mask use to 95% in the United States could save 44 000 lives between now and 1 Jun 2021.

"There are serious concerns that with the spread of new COVID-19 variants, achieving herd immunity necessary to end the pandemic may be difficult if not impossible," said Dr. Christopher Murray, IHME director. "We may be able to bring COVID-19 under control if we continue to focus on the strategies that can keep transmission low -- avoiding gatherings, wearing masks, and other measures -- while working to get as many people vaccinated as possible."

"The emerging variants of COVID-19 are showing us more about the effectiveness of vaccines as well as the strength of natural immunity from previous infections," said Murray. "We are closely monitoring the clinical trial results as new findings could have significant bearing on the trajectory of the pandemic, which we will reflect in our model."

"While previous infections may not be effective at blocking the transmission of emerging variants, there are clear indications that the vaccines may still prevent from half to two-thirds of severe cases and deaths from such variants," said Murray.

Between now and 1 Jun 2021, 110 countries are expected to see high or extreme stress on intensive care units due to COVID-19. If people who are vaccinated return to normal levels of mobility, 17 states in the United States and 13 countries in Europe could see an increase in daily deaths in April and May [2021].

IHME's projections are based on an epidemiological model that includes data on cases, deaths, and antibody prevalence, as well as location-specific COVID-19 testing rates, vaccination rollout, mobility, social distancing mandates, mask use, population density and age structure, and pneumonia seasonality, which shows a strong correlation with the trajectory of COVID-19.

The new projections for all countries are available at https://covid19.healthdata.org/.

[The bottom line is the more sequencing done, the more mutations are detected and new variants are named. This makes it particularly difficult to predict the trajectory of cases in the future because some variants are more likely to evade neutralization by antibody from previous infections or vaccines. Furthermore, we do not have a clear understanding of the impact of all the mutations detected on infectiousness and transmissibility of the strains. But clearly some mutations have lent an advantage to the virus, and these strains can spread rapidly absent masks and social distancing. The greater the proportion of individuals vaccinated, the slower the virus will spread with fewer naive people available, and the fewer opportunities the virus will have to mutate. This is the way to slow down the case trajectory. - Mod.LK]

Citation: Guy GP Jr, Lee FC, Sunshine G, et al. Association of state-issued mask mandates and allowing on-premises restaurant dining with county-level COVID-19 case and death growth rates -- United States, March 1-December 31, 2020. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. Epub 5 Mar 2021. http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7010e3

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Universal masking and avoiding nonessential indoor spaces are recommended to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

What is added by this report?
Mandating masks was associated with a decrease in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates within 20 days of implementation. Allowing on-premises restaurant dining was associated with an increase in daily COVID-19 case growth rates 41-100 days after implementation and an increase in daily death growth rates 61-100 days after implementation.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Mask mandates and restricting any on-premises dining at restaurants can help limit community transmission of COVID-19 and reduce case and death growth rates. These findings can inform public policies to reduce community spread of COVID-19.

---
CDC recommends a combination of evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1 [see source URL for complete references, figure, and tables]). Because the virus is transmitted predominantly by inhaling respiratory droplets from infected persons, universal mask use can help reduce transmission (1). Starting in April [2020], 39 states and the District of Columbia (DC) issued mask mandates. Reducing person-to-person interactions by avoiding nonessential shared spaces, such as restaurants, where interactions are typically unmasked and physical distancing (6 ft or more) is difficult to maintain, can also decrease transmission (2). In March and April 2020, 49 states and DC prohibited any on-premises dining at restaurants, but by mid-June [2020], all states and DC had lifted these restrictions. To examine the association of state-issued mask mandates and allowing on-premises restaurant dining with COVID-19 cases and deaths during 1 Mar 2020-31 Dec 2020, county-level data on mask mandates and restaurant reopenings were compared with county-level changes in COVID-19 case and death growth rates relative to the mandate implementation and reopening dates. Mask mandates were associated with decreases in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-80, and 81-100 days after implementation. Allowing any on-premises dining at restaurants was associated with increases in daily COVID-19 case growth rates 41-60, 61-80, and 81-100 days after reopening, and increases in daily COVID-19 death growth rates 61-80 and 81-100 days after reopening. Implementing mask mandates was associated with reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whereas reopening restaurants for on-premises dining was associated with increased transmission. Policies that require universal mask use and restrict any on-premises restaurant dining are important components of a comprehensive strategy to reduce exposure to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (1). Such efforts are increasingly important given the emergence of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United States (3,4).

Discussion
Mask mandates were associated with statistically significant decreases in county-level daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates within 20 days of implementation. Allowing on-premises restaurant dining was associated with increases in county-level case and death growth rates within 41-80 days after reopening. State mask mandates and prohibiting on-premises dining at restaurants help limit potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2, reducing community transmission of COVID-19.

Studies have confirmed the effectiveness of community mitigation measures in reducing the prevalence of COVID-19 (5-8). Mask mandates are associated with reductions in COVID-19 case and hospitalization growth rates (6,7), whereas reopening on-premises dining at restaurants, a known risk factor associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (2), is associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths, particularly in the absence of mask mandates (8). The current study builds upon this evidence by accounting for county-level variation in state-issued mitigation measures and highlights the importance of a comprehensive strategy to decrease exposure to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Prohibiting on-premises restaurant dining might assist in limiting potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2; however, such orders might disrupt daily life and have an adverse impact on the economy and the food services industry (9). If on-premises restaurant dining options are not prohibited, CDC offers considerations for operators and customers which can reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 in restaurant settings (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/business-employers/bars-restaurants.html). COVID-19 case and death growth rates might also have increased because of persons engaging in close contact activities other than or in addition to on-premises restaurant dining in response to perceived reduced risk as a result of states allowing restaurants to reopen. Further studies are needed to assess the effect of a multicomponent community mitigation strategy on economic activity.

Increases in COVID-19 case and death growth rates were significantly associated with on-premises dining at restaurants after indoor or outdoor on-premises dining was allowed by the state for more than 40 days. Several factors might explain this observation. Even though prohibition of on-premises restaurant dining was lifted, restaurants were not required to open and might have delayed reopening. In addition, potential restaurant patrons might have been more cautious when restaurants initially reopened for on-premises dining but might have been more likely to dine at restaurants as time passed. Further analyses are necessary to evaluate the delayed increase in case and death growth rates.
