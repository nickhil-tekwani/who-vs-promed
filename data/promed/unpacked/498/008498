Five cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Corrientes province, Argentina
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Now there are 5 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis detected in Riachuelo community, Corrientes province; since yesterday afternoon [31 Aug 2015], 3 new cases were reported, adding on to the 2 cases detected some days ago. For this reason, the Ministry of Health is performing vector control activities and detailed investigations in the areas where the cases had been detected.

From the Ministry of Public Health, Dr. Meza pointed out that (leishmaniasis) cases have only been found in the aforementioned community and the visceral form has not been reported (yet). With respect to pets, she declared that "one measure is to sacrifice them and the other way is to take responsible care of the animal, so it may stay alive but not be capable of transmitting the disease to the vector." Dr. Meza explained that the cutaneous form is benign, since the lesion is confined to the skin, with no involvement of deep tissues, unless there is an underlying condition, and differently from the visceral form which may be potentially lethal."

With respect to weather issues, the officer explained that "since there are not so many cold days, this has an influence on the occurrence of vector-borne diseases," specifically referring to chikungunya and dengue fever. For this reason, she insisted on the need for vector control, with proper cleaning of all outdoor water reservoirs and avoiding the accumulation of fallen leaves.
