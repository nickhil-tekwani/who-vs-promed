The Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI) has announced that a Rift Valley fever [RVF] outbreak has killed a total of 99 cows and caused 452 abortions in the districts of Kirehe, Ngoma, Kayonza, and Rwamagana in the Eastern Province.

According to MINAGRI, the disease, caused by a virus transmitted by mosquitoes, 1st appeared in the Eastern province on 18 May 2018.

The disease affects animals (like cows, sheep, goats), and humans. The ministry says that laboratory tests have revealed RVF virus in 80 percent of affected cattle.

In a statement, MINAGRI said that they have established teams of veterinarians to treat the affected cows. Currently, a total of 1638 have been treated, and 1202 among them were cured.

In Ngoma district alone, the disease killed 66 cows with 168 aborted; in Kirehe 17 died, while 159 aborted; in Kayonza 9 died, while 60 aborted, and in Rwamagana, 7 died, while 65 aborted.

According to MINAGRI, efforts to vaccinate cattle that have not been affected were intensified, and treatment services were made available to cattle with the disease symptoms.

MINAGRI urges people not to consume uninspected meat and to report cases presenting RVF-related symptoms to veterinarians.

[Previous media reports mentioned 3 affected districts in the Eastern province, namely Ngoma, Kirehe, and Kyonza. According to the current report, RVF has spread to a 4th district, Rwamagana.

So far, no human cases have been reported from Rwanda.

The disease has recently spread in Kenya, where it affected animals and humans, killing, as of 13 Jun 2018, 6 human patients. Kenya is the site where the 1st RVF epizootic, affecting animals and humans, was diagnosed, as published in 1931. The recent event in animals (camels) has been duly reported to the OIE (20180609.5847976). Rwanda's OIE notification is pending.

In South Africa, where the disease was identified for the 1st time in 1950, RVF was confirmed in mid-May 2018 in sheep on a single farm in Free State province; no human cases have been reported, and no further spread has been reported since. All livestock farmers in South Africa were advised to vaccinate their cattle, sheep, and goats yearly or at least once during weaning. While the live attenuated (Smithburn) RVF vaccine will immunize for an extended duration, pregnant animals should preferably be vaccinated with the killed vaccine, which confers a shorter immunity requiring revaccinations. For further details on the said vaccines, see OIE's RVF chapter 2.1.18 in the Terrestrial Manual, available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.18_RVF.pdf.

Subscribers are referred to FAO's recent (2018) publication on RVF Surveillance, which includes also updated information and guidelines on RVF control and prevention measures in affected and threatened countries. Vaccination regimes in different epidemiological situations have been revisited by the author. The document (80 pages) is available at http://www.fao.org/3/i8475en/I8475EN.pdf. - Mod.AS
