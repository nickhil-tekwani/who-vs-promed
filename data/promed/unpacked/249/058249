I commented on TBE [tick-borne encephalitis] incidence in Switzerland a little less than a year ago. In fact, last year (2017), had been the year with the highest number of reported TBE cases (269) thus far, exceeding the previous record year, 2006, by around 25 cases. Current year's [2018] case numbers already exceed last year's record numbers by far already (325), even though many more cases, maybe around 100, are expected to occur until the end of this transmission season.

The current year-to-year upward cascading pattern is reminiscent of the years 2003 to 2006, after which the annual case numbers were consistently well above 100. I expect a similar upward reset of the annual baseline after the current series of seasonal increases. Whether some of that increase may be due to a change in reporting practices will have to be determined. However, the remarkable consistency of the total case/hospitalized cases ratio (hospitalized cases were reported only until 2001) suggests that at least part of this increase is real.

Persistence and spread of tick-borne encephalitis in Central/Western/Northern Europe, given the current paradigm of enzootic perpetuation, is implausible (1). So why has TBE incidence been increasing substantially over the past 3 or more decades? The most consistently offered explanation is "climate change" (2), but a linear mechanism is unlikely to linearly affect the complex system of TBE perpetuation.

Anthropogenic ecological changes, too, have been implicated in increasing TBE incidence (3). Unfortunately, Federal funding agencies have not been keen in supporting research aiming at exploring the underlying root causes -- at least not when I last tried 8 years ago.

[The number of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) cases in Switzerland has increased from 230 on 24 Jul 2018, to 272 on 13 Aug 2018, to 325 one month later, as listed above. As noted earlier, the virus is endemic (and expanding) in certain areas of the country, as well as in some areas of Germany and Austria.

In a previous comment last year (2017) concerning TBE in Switzerland, Dr Ivo M Foppa indicated that the incidence of TBE in Switzerland has increased distinctly since 2000, roughly about 50 percent. The reason for the increase of TBE incidence in Central/Western/Northern Europe is unknown, as Dr Foppa notes above. He is thanked for his comments.

The WHO has stated that "Approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of tick-borne encephalitis are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total. Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality: FSME-Immun and Encepur, manufactured in Austria and Germany, respectively, and based on European strains of the virus; and TBE-Moscow and EnceVir, manufactured in the Russian Federation and based on Far-Eastern strains. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious." (http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/tick_encephalitis/en/).

TBE is a viral infection caused by one of 3 tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. - Mod.TY
