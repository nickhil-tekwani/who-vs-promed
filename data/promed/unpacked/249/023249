[A quick scan of the world's distribution of foot-and-mouth disease
reveals the fact that South America has made comparatively good
strides against foot-and-mouth disease over the last few years,
especially since the situation in the Southern Cone countries of the
continent has moderated. The outbreaks are relatively few and far
between, being confined to trouble spots like Ecuador and Venezuela.
So it is not surprising that this outbreak is just kilometers from
the border with Venezuela. This favorable state of affairs when it
comes to foot-and-mouth disease is building upon decades of efforts
to improve human nutrition in the region by the provision of high
quality protein of bovine origin. After so much sustained success,
eradication seems to be worth considering.
