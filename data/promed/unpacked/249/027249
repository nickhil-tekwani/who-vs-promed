Local hunting and fishing gets so busy this time of year, it's easy to
ignore what's going on elsewhere. Sometimes, though, news brings a shudder
of recognition. A few years ago, a productive deer hunting spot in Nebraska
suddenly came up virtually deer-less.
Where we'd seen pretty good numbers of mature bucks and big does, we were
mostly seeing lone fawns. First one hunter, then another, reported seeing
an adult deer running with its lips rolled back, a spot or 2 of blood
visible. Several of us caught the sickening odor of a decaying animal down
near a marsh edge.
Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD), we would learn, had pretty much wiped
out our hunting spot. Spread by tiny flying insects called biting midges,
EHD causes severe, flu-like symptoms in deer.
High fever sends deer toward water for relief, and that's often where they
die, often less than 3 days after becoming infected. Cattle can suffer from
it, but dogs and cats don't get it. EHD does not appear to affect humans,
but hunters are always urged to avoid contact with sick animals. If deer
survive the infection, they often have cracked hooves or heavy hoof
overgrowth.
A hard frost is said to kill off biting midges, ending that year's
outbreak. Whitetail populations recover, but it can take years.
This year, a news release reported EHD in west-central Indiana. Up to 30
EHD-killed deer were found there.
Then, a week or so ago, Michigan's DNR and Michigan State University's
Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health confirmed 2 Allegan
County deer infected with EHD. Their carcasses were among about 50 dead
deer found along southwest Lower Michigan rivers and marshes. One was a
free-ranging deer and 1 was privately owned.
Bill Moritz, chief of the DNR's wildlife division, said Michigan seldom
gets hit with EHD, which he said is considered the most important viral
disease facing whitetails nationwide. It last struck here in 1955 and 1974.
"When all conditions are right -- weather, virus and host -- the disease
may occur," he said in a news release.
We're not alone. So far this year, besides Indiana, EHD has been diagnosed
in Oregon, Wyoming, Texas, Missouri, Illinois and Georgia. If you find a
dead deer near water, or if you shoot one with unusual hoof growth or hoof
damage, contact the nearest DNR office (Bay City, Sanford or Gladwin, for
most of us), or visit the DNR website at <http://www.michigan.gov/dnr>.

[EHD is not uncommon in many states. EHD is an acute, infectious, often
fatal viral disease of some wild ruminants. This malady, characterized by
extensive hemorrhages, has been responsible for significant epizootics in
deer in the northern United States and southern Canada. A similar
hemorrhagic disease called bluetongue also occurs in wild ruminants. The 2
diseases are antigenically different, although there are similar clinical
signs.
The first occurrence and subsequent identification of EHD occurred in 1955,
when several hundred white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) succumbed
in both New Jersey and in Michigan. It was considered a new disease of
deer, and the name "epizootic hemorrhagic disease" was suggested to
describe its main clinical and pathological features.
Since the initial 1955 outbreak, this malady has occurred primarily among
white-tailed deer, although occasionally mule deer (_O. hemionus_) and
pronghorn antelope (_Antilocapra americana_) have also succumbed.
The mode of transmission of EHD in nature is via a _Culicoides_ biting fly
or gnat. _Culicoides variipennis_ is the most commonly incriminated vector
in North America. A common observation in outbreaks involving large numbers
of deer (as in Michigan, New Jersey, and Alberta) is that they are single
epizootics that do not recur. Die-offs involving small numbers of deer (as
experienced in South Dakota and Nebraska) occur almost annually, and the
disease appears to be enzootic in these areas. All documented outbreaks of
EHD have occurred during late summer and early fall (August-October) and
have ceased abruptly with the onset of frost.
Clinical signs of EHD and bluetongue are similar. White-tailed deer develop
signs of illness about 7 days after exposure. A consistent characteristic
of the disease is its sudden onset. Deer initially lose their appetite and
fear of man, grow progressively weaker, often salivate excessively, develop
rapid pulse and respiration, and finally become unconscious. Hemorrhage and
lack of oxygen in the blood result in a blue appearance of the oral mucosa,
hence the name "bluetongue". Between 8 and 36 hours following the onset of
observable signs, deer pass into a shock-like state, become prostrate, and
die.
The gross and histological lesions of EHD are characterized by extensive
hemorrhage, ranging from pin-point to massive in size, and involve
different tissues and organs in individual animals. No organs appear to be
exempt from hemorrhage, with the most regularly involved being the heart,
liver, spleen, kidney, lung, and intestinal tract. Extensive hemorrhaging
is the result of interference with the blood-clotting mechanism together
with degeneration of blood vessel walls.
Because of its very high mortality rate, EHD can have a significant effect
upon the deer population in a given area, reducing numbers drastically.
Hemorrhagic disease can be transmitted to other wild ruminants. The EHD
virus can infect domestic animals but rarely causes disease. Presently
there is no evidence that the virus crosses into humans.
