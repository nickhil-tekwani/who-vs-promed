First Occurrence of Powdery Mildew Caused by _Leveillula taurica_ on Pepper
in New York.
M. T. McGrath and N. Shishkoff, Department of Plant Pathology, Long Island
Horticultural Research and Extension Center, Cornell University, 3059 Sound
Ave., Riverhead, NY 11901-1098; C. Bornt, Cornell Cooperative Extension,
216 E Main St., Batavia, NY 14020; and D. D. Moyer, Cornell Cooperative
Extension, 246 Griffing Ave., Riverhead, NY 11901-3086. Plant Dis. 85:1122,
2001; published on-line as D-2001-0816-01N, 2001. Accepted for publication
16 July 2001.
Powdery mildew [of pepper (_Capsicum annuum_ L.) was first reported in
North America in 1971 in southwest Florida (1)]. It was observed for the
first time on pepper in western New York in August 1999 and on Long Island,
NY, in August 2000. Infected plants were found in commercial fields planted
with transplants from Georgia and Florida. Powdery mildew was not found in
nearby commercial fields in either year, and it was not found in 2000 in
western New York. Symptoms included white sporulation on the undersurfaces
of leaves, causing yellow lesions on upper surfaces that turned necrotic
and led to premature defoliation.
The pathogen was confirmed to be _Leveillula taurica _(Lev.) G. Arnaud, a
species complex that infects more than 1 000 plant species in 74 families,
including pepper, tomato and eggplant. Only the _Oidiopsis_ [asexual] stage
was found. Conidia were 47.3 to 74.3 micrometers x 10.5 to 20.3 micrometers
(average 64.0 x 16.8 micrometers (N = 71). Symptoms were observed on all
cultivars of bell and chili pepper in the Long Island field but not on
tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_) and eggplant (_Solanum melongena_ var.
_esculentum_) in adjacent rows.
Symptoms were found on field-grown peppers in Florida in April 2001 at the
time that transplants were being produced for New York. Considering the
latent period is 18 to 21 days and symptoms tend to be initially subtle,
diseased seedlings could easily go undetected. This disease is a problem on
tomatoes and peppers in California (2), Arizona, Utah, and Nevada.
[The disease] ... was reported in Puerto Rico in 1992, in Idaho on
greenhouse-grown pepper in 1998, in north-central Mexico in 1998, and in
both Canada and Oklahoma on greenhouse-grown pepper in 1999. It has not
been reported ... in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, North
Carolina, or Ohio.

[Most chile pepper cultivars lack resistance to this disease. Disease
management depends primarily on timely applications of sulfur-containing
fungicides. A couple of references of interest are the following from plant
pathologists at Cornell University and New Mexico State University:
