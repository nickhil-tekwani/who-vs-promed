[African swine fever is simply a devastating disease. It is one of those diseases that no country wants to bear, so it is very unfortunate that Ukraine has its 1st case. It is a horrible disease for the swine involved and is economically devastating. The location in the Ukraine, just near the Sea of Azov, slightly northwest of the Black Sea, is very far from the outbreak reported from Russia near Moscow a few days ago. Such geographically widespread outbreaks are worrisome and should be dealt with with the utmost seriousness, resource allocation, and cooperation between veterinary authorities.

I am reposting below Mod.AS's comments from the Russian outbreak a few days ago about the control of ASF (see African swine fever - Russia (04): (TV), control measures 20120728.1218320). - Mod.PC:

The following relevant commentary is derived from FAO's EMPRES Transboundary Animal Diseases Bulletin No. 40 (July 2012):

"African swine fever (ASF) continues to persist in the endemic southern regions of the Russian Federation, affecting backyard holdings and commercial pig production units. During the 1st half of 2012, the virus again jumped out of its endemic zone to the Republic of Karelia, beyond 63o north and 200 km from the border with Finland, and there is now a growing risk of it becoming endemic in the temperate forest zone in the centre of the eastern European plain. Particularly in Tverskaya Oblast, ASF cases in wild boar have been reported for more than a year (since May 2011). If the virus establishes itself in wild boar populations, several countries in the region -- including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine -- will be at risk of virus introduction from wildlife."

Since the initial introduction of the virus on Russia's border with Georgia in November 2007, 260 outbreaks in domestic and wild swine have been reported from the Russian Federation throughout vast sections of its European part from south to north; see interactive OIE map at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8462 (zoom in). - Mod.AS
