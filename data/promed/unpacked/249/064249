Yemen
- National. 14 Jan 2019. 192 children have died with 52 000 cases recorded across the country.
At least 78 children in war-torn Yemen have died from dengue-related illnesses, Save the Children said Tuesday [14 Jan 2020], warning of an epidemic. "78 children under 16 have already died in the outbreak of dengue-related illness in Yemen, with more than 52 000 suspected cases being recorded across the country," the aid group said in a statement.

It added that this "could signal the start of an epidemic." Save the Children said that a total of 192 people died in Yemen last year [2019] from dengue-related illnesses, most cases reported in the port cities of Hodeida and Aden. "Hodeida has the 2nd highest death rate in the country with 62 adult and children deaths in 2019. We have never seen anything like this before," the group said. According to the Red Cross, in November 2019, Yemen was already grappling with an epidemic of the viral disease, which is transmitted by several species of mosquito that breed in stagnant water.

- La Mayotte. 7 Jan 2020. Since the beginning of the year [2020], 52 cases of dengue fever have been recorded in the department, including 35 in the commune of Mtsamboro. The regional health agency set up a 2nd mosquito control campaign in the northern commune in less than a week. It is, therefore, a common effort between L'ARS and the commune of Mtsamboro to carry out a mosquito control campaign in the commune in order to stop the spread of dengue. With rakes, brooms, and trash bags, in their hands, the villagers roam the streets, hunting for rubbish. The beach, in the gutters, the streets, the nooks and crannies are combed through because there is an emergency. Mayotte has entered an important pre-epidemiological period.
