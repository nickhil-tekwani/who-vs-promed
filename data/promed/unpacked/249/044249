Another 3 Ebola cases, along with 2 more deaths, have been confirmed in an outbreak in Equateur province in the DRC, the WHO African regional office said on Twitter.

The developments push the outbreak total to 65 cases, 61 of them confirmed and 4 listed as probable, and 29 deaths. The new cases appear to be from Mbandaka, the provincial capital, which is located on a river and has travel connections to Kinshasa and neighboring countries
[see https://twitter.com/WHOAFRO/status/1286584757262983169].

In a related development, UNICEF warned yesterday [23 Jul 2020] that the number of children who have lost parents who died or are separated from parents undergoing screening or treatment is rising fast in the Equateur province outbreak. In a statement, it said the response needs to be stepped up, but so far it hasn't received any funding to battle the latest outbreak.

UNICEF said it and partners have helped 10 children in temporary protection, but urgent support is needed to build nurseries close to Ebola treatment centers. The organization estimates that it needs USD 6.98 million for response activities; so far, it has drawn USD 2 million from its own resources to fund the response until it gets additional funding.

- Mon 20 Jul 2020. Spread from Mbandaka
[Al Jazeera, abridged, edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/07/western-drc-ebola-cases-60-warns-funeral-risks-200720191218780.html

Ebola cases in western Democratic Republic of the Congo have risen to [65] with funerals a particular concern for the spread of the disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday [20 Jul 2020].

"The disease is active, not controlled," [WHO emergencies expert Mike] Ryan told a virtual briefing from the UN agency's headquarters in Geneva, noting burial practices as a worry.

The outbreak is DRC's 11th since Ebola was identified in 1976.

Equateur province includes part of the River Congo, a large geographical area where communities are linked across, and people travel long distances.

It is spreading from Mbandaka's urban centre to surrounding remote villages in forests along the Congo River, some of which can only be accessed by canoe or all-terrain vehicles.

DRC is facing a measles outbreak that has killed more than 6000 people since early last year [2019], as well as recurring flare-ups of cholera and malaria. It is also struggling with the new coronavirus, with 8249 cases including 193 fatalities.

WHO officials worry that because of these competing health crises, there could be a lack of funding for the Ebola epidemic.

[The spread of the virus from Mbandaka's urban centre to surrounding remote villages in forests along the Congo River.is of real concern as it allows the virus to spread undetected. The Congo River also provides an avenue for rapid and widespread dissemination of Ebola virus. For these reasons, this outbreak needs to be watched carefully as it has the potential to expand rapidly. - Mod LK]

- Thu 23 Jul 2020. Children separated from families
[UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund), edited]

More than 32 children have lost or have been separated from one or both parents due to Ebola since a new outbreak was declared on [1 Jun 2020] in Equateur Province, western Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), UNICEF said today, as the organisation warned that the response urgently needs to be stepped up.

A previous outbreak in Equateur Province in 2018 was brought under control within just 2 months, thanks to the speed and scale of the response and donor support. However, UNICEF is yet to receive any funding to fight the new outbreak.

UNICEF and partners have assisted 10 children in temporary protection facilities while one or both of their parents undergo screening or treatment in one of the 4 Ebola treatment centres in the province. However, UNICEF needs urgent support to build nurseries in close proximity of the Ebola treatment centres in order to provide adequate care for separated children.

"As we have seen in previous epidemics, Ebola affects children in a number of ways beyond the immediate risk of infection and death," said Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF's Representative in DRC. "Whether children are infected themselves, or see parents or other family members infected, they require specialized care and support, both physically and psychologically. We must do our utmost to minimize the impact of the epidemic on children's wellbeing."

The 11th Ebola outbreak to hit DRC since 1976 has so far recorded 62 cases and 27 deaths -- including 2 children. According to UNICEF's records, more than 20 children between the ages of 2 and 17 years have passed through one of the 4 treatment centres with suspected or confirmed Ebola in Equateur Province. The children are closely monitored in dedicated areas of the treatment centre, where UNICEF and partners provide nutrition and psychosocial support. In addition, UNICEF has provided community-based care to 10 children under 24 months who have been separated from their parents.

UNICEF urges national partners and international donors to support the Ebola response in Equateur and its work to provide specialized assistance to vulnerable children, as resources are not keeping up with the pace of the epidemic. The response has been hampered by the limited number of organizations on the ground in Equateur, donor fatigue related to Ebola in DRC, and the additional pressure that the growing COVID-19 epidemic is putting on the country's weakened health system.

UNICEF estimates that USD 6.98 million is required for its activities to respond to Ebola in Equateur. UNICEF has advanced USD 2 million from its own resources to meet critical needs until additional funding is secured.

[The 10th Ebola outbreak that began in 2018 in the DRC, prior to the current outbreak, disproportionately affected women and children, who represent 56 per cent and 28 per cent of reported cases, respectively.

Children are also affected by family separation and the loss of parents and caregivers. For families and children, the Ebola virus disease (EVD) has also undermined access to basic services such as health care and education. UNICEF is addressing these needs across its response, including through prevention efforts, treatment and psychological and social care
