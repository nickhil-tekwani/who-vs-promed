[The report of the WPV1-associated paralysis in Afghanistan is the 1st report of any poliovirus (wild or vaccine derived) associated paralysis with onset of illness in 2022. All other reports of cVDPV2-associated isolates from paralytic cases as well as environmental samples are related to sampling in 2021. Nigeria continues to have ongoing transmission of cVDPV2 with a cumulative total of 397 cases involving numerous states in the country.

As of 9 Feb 2022, the total number of cVDPV confirmed cases during 2021 is 610 cases -- 55% of the total confirmed in 2020. In the past week alone, there were 4 countries with documented presence of cVDPV2. During 2021, there was one country with AFP-associated cVDPV1 cases, 20 countries reporting one or more AFP cases associated with cVDPV2 infections, and an additional 8 countries reporting positive environmental samples for cVDPV2, and one country reporting a positive environmental sample for cVDPV3 (see table at https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/weekly-polio-analyses-cVDPV-20220208.pdf for data by country).

[3] Pakistan, Afghanistan
Date: Sun 6 Feb 2022

https://www.dawn.com/news/1673561/experts-link-pakistans-polio-free-status-to-eradication-of-virus-in-afghanistan


Though Pakistan has completed one year without a case of polio, health experts believe that the country cannot become polio free unless the virus is eradicated from Afghanistan, as both countries have been put in one block. They also believe that sick refusals, either genuine or as a pretext to avoid vaccination, were a major reason for the failure to vaccinate 100% of children. Moreover, positive environmental samples are also a major challenge.

However, special assistant to the prime minister (SAPM) Dr Faisal Sultan said it was a conjecture that Pakistan can only be declared a polio-free country along with Afghanistan, adding the world would have to listen when time would come to issue the certification. On 27 Jan 2022, Pakistan completed one year without detection of a polio case. The only case in 2021 was reported from Balochistan, and all other federating and administrative units of the country remained polio free last year [2021]. According to international requirements, a country needs 3 years of no cases to attain a polio-free status. Currently, Pakistan and Afghanistan are only 2 countries reporting polio cases. However, the virus has been detected in environmental samples of different cities.

If a polio virus is found in sewage, the sample is called positive. Sample of sewage from the area is the basic parameter to see if polio campaigns are being done successfully or not. A polio case can be reported in any city because of frequent movement of people to it from other areas, but if the virus is found in the sewage it means that polio campaigns in the area could not achieve the target. Moreover, the presence of poliovirus in sewage also shows that the immunity level of the children in the area has decreased and they are at the risk of the disease.

Expert on public health, Dr Nadeem Jan, while talking to Dawn, said that it was a major achievement that the country had not reported any polio case for a year. "However, environmental samples are still being found positive. It means that the virus is spreading through children or adults. We are not getting cases of paralysis because immunity of children has been boosted due to the repeated polio campaigns. I suggest that the polio programme should ensure that over 95% of children are vaccinated during every campaign and the momentum should continue," he said.

When asked about the challenges, Dr Jan said refusals were the major reason for failing to eradicate the virus. "A large number of people either refuse to get their children vaccinated or say their children are sick. We need to develop a mechanism to ensure that if a child is sick he/she should be vaccinated after a few days. It is a fact that there is resistance against vaccination in Pakistan and same is the case in Europe, America and Africa, as people are refusing to vaccinate themselves against COVID-19. We need to ensure that no case is reported for the next 2 years and environmental samples also remain negative," he said.

"Another challenge is that Pakistan and Afghanistan have been put in one block due to which there is an impression that we cannot become polio free unless the virus is eradicated from the neighbouring country. We will have to convince the world and the polio certification committee to look at us with a different lens and issue the polio eradication certificate to Pakistan. We also need to engage religious figures, politicians, district administrations and others to ensure maximum coverage during polio campaigns," Dr Jan suggested.

Dr Sultan, while talking to Dawn, said: "Every country has different epidemiology and we can convince the world that we should be considered as polio-free country. However, it is a fact that we have a lot of traffic from Afghanistan and there will always be a risk of transportation of the virus to Pakistan. Our primary responsibility is to eradicate polio within the country and then we will have to keep an eye on ensuring that the virus is not transported from the neighbouring country to Pakistan. We have also started coordinated polio campaigns along with Afghanistan," he said.

[The vaccine hesitancy movement (those against vaccination of their children) has insidiously crept into lower- and middle-income countries as well as high-income countries. The above article highlights the obstacles to polio eradication in Afghanistan and Pakistan, especially focusing on the unvaccinated children due to parental blockage.

In doing a search of the media for polio-related articles I stumbled across an article mentioning a state in the USA that may remove all vaccine mandates (not just COVID, but removing the school entry vaccination mandates for childhood vaccinations) -- a scary slippery slope the state may go down with potentially disastrous impact. I remember when we worked on passing the mandatory vaccinations for school entry in every state to combat the low vaccination coverages -- in those days mostly due to complacency and a sense these diseases were no longer a threat in the USA. I shutter to think of the impact of such an action (see https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/editorials/article257938793.html). - Mod.MPP]

[4] cVDPV continues
Date: Tue 25 Jan 2022
Source: IDSE Infectious Disease Special Edition [edited]
https://www.idse.net/Immunology--Vaccination/Article/01-22/Vaccine-Derived-Poliovirus-Outbreaks-Continue/65924


Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) outbreaks, which can occur in underimmunized groups, occurred in 37 countries during 2020, and global cases increased from 366 in 2019 to 1078 in 2020.

Most cases (86%) were caused by cVDPV type 2, affecting 28 African countries (http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7049a1). In March 2021, officials responded by using a novel type 2 oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), modified to be more genetically stable than Sabin strain poliovirus, in those areas. However, supplies of this vaccine are limited.

"Ongoing and new cVDPV outbreaks threaten progress toward polio eradication," said Mary M. Alleman, PhD, an epidemiologist with the CDC's Global Immunization Division. From January 2020 through June 2021, 44 cVDPV outbreaks affected 37 countries, 28% of which were located in Africa. Half of the cases had been previously detected during 2017-2019; 3 were newly detected in 2019; and 16 were newly detected during 2020-2021. Overall, the outbreaks resulted in 1335 paralytic cases, with 1293 due to type 2 cVDPV outbreaks.

Dr Alleman noted that the increase in cases during 2020 and 2021 could be tied, in part, to fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. "Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, polio surveillance and outbreak response vaccination activities were disrupted," she said. "Moreover, poor-quality and delayed vaccination campaigns resulted in lingering cVDPV2 transmission and the emergence of new outbreaks due to low overall type 2 immunity."

In May 2021, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative launched an updated strategy to stop cVDPV type 2 outbreaks by the end of 2023. "Part of this strategy," Dr Alleman said, "includes introducing a novel oral polio vaccine (nOPV2) developed to be more genetically stable than the Sabin-strain type 2 that can revert to cause paralysis after prolonged spread in under-immunized populations."

The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, the WHO director-general's Emergency Committee for the International Health Regulations regarding the spread of poliovirus as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and the GPEI Independent Monitoring Board declared cVDPV type 2 outbreaks are a "public health emergency of international concern". They "require rapid responses with available type 2 polio vaccines, whether Sabin or nOPV2", Dr Alleman said.
