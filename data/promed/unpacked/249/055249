The Minister of Health, Jorge López, announced that the 1st case of a person infected with monkeypox has been detected in Peru, after carrying out the corresponding tests.

"This case presented in the capital (Lima) is a patient who yesterday (Saturday [25 Jun 2022]) has had all the laboratory tests done and which have come out positive for monkeypox," said the member of the agency on TV Peru.

He stated that [the patient] is a foreigner who lives in Peru and who apparently has had contact with people who come from other countries. He is currently isolated, as are his relatives, since they have had contact.

In addition, he indicated that the foreigner has presented with the symptoms for 10 days and that the people with whom he has had contact in the country are being followed up on to rule them out.

"He was hospitalized at the Santa Rosa hospital and is currently at home because his condition is stable; he does not need to be in a health facility," he added.

[4] United Kingdom vaccination clinic risk
Date: Mon 27 Jun 2022
Source: UK Government Health Security Agency [edited]
https://www.gov.uk/guidance/monkeypox-reducing-risk-of-transmission-at-vaccination-clinics


This guidance is intended for use by healthcare providers and professionals managing post-exposure vaccination clinics to help reduce the risk of transmission of monkeypox infection to other people during these clinics. Pre-exposure vaccination should be managed in the same way as routine vaccination using standard infection prevention and control (IPC) precautions.

This guidance provides advice on the risk assessment process and actions to be taken when individuals are travelling to and attending vaccination clinics. It should be read in conjunction with the national IPC manual.

Healthcare workers administering vaccinations for monkeypox are not required to be vaccinated against monkeypox.

Information on management of monkeypox contacts can be found in the monkeypox contact tracing guidance. Further background information on monkeypox is also available.

Risk assessment
------------------
Assess exposure date:
Undertake an initial risk assessment of the individual via telephone before they attend the clinic in person to identify the date that they were first exposed to a case of monkeypox.

The incubation period of monkeypox is 5-21 days.

There is currently no evidence that individuals are infectious before the onset of the prodromal illness.

Risk-assess for signs and symptoms of the infection:
During your risk assessment, you should ask if the individual
- has a fever (≥ 38 deg C [100.4 deg F])
- has a recent onset of any new prodromal symptoms: headache, backache, muscle ache, joint pain, chills, exhaustion, swollen lymph nodes
- has any evidence of new spots (even a few) or a rash: ask them to check carefully, including hands, feet and genital areas

If the individual does not have any clinical features of monkeypox infection, they can proceed to be vaccinated.

If the individual has a fever or any of the other symptoms listed above, they are considered a possible case of monkeypox and should not attend for vaccination until there has been a further assessment. They should be advised to isolate at home and inform their designated UKHSA health protection team (HPT) contact on the number they have been provided with. The HPT will undertake a risk assessment and advise them on next steps.

If the HPT risk assessment considers that the contact does not meet any of the case definitions for monkeypox, they can be reconsidered for vaccination.

Travel and vaccination clinic arrangements
----------------------------------------
Travelling to the vaccination clinic:
Contacts who are advised to self-isolate should avoid using public transport or taxis to travel to the clinic. If possible, they should walk, cycle, or drive. If these are not possible, they can be driven by a household member (if the household member is not immunosuppressed or pregnant). Where private transport is not available, public transport can be used; however, busy periods should be avoided.

Vaccination clinic:
The clinic should be sited with a separate entrance and exit from all other users. A drive-through clinic could be considered. Individuals should be provided with a clinical contact number in advance.

On arrival at the vaccination clinic, individuals should not enter the hospital or clinic, but call the clinic to let them know they have arrived.

Individuals should be directed into the clinic via a dedicated route. Where clinics are unable to immediately receive the individual, they may be asked to wait outside and be called back when the clinic is ready.

On entering the vaccination clinic, the healthcare worker should take the individual's temperature and ask if there are any of the symptoms above that might be indicative of monkeypox. If they do not have a fever or any of the other above symptoms, they can be taken into the vaccination room or clinic to proceed with vaccination. No specific personal protective equipment (PPE) is required and standard precautions, as used for any vaccination, are applicable. Standard hand hygiene should be followed, and any contact surface (chair and table) should be wiped down before and after each patient. Refer to the national IPC manual for further information.

Following vaccination, individuals should continue to follow the isolation advice they have been provided with.

If individuals remain well and do not have any further significant exposure, the 2nd dose at 28 days can be given in routine settings.

[5] Reaction to WHO emergency decision
Date: Sun 26 Jun 2022
Source: Science Media Centre [edited]
https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-who-emergency-committee-not-recommending-that-the-ongoing-monkeypox-outbreaks-be-declared-a-public-health-emergency-of-international-concern-pheic/


At the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee meeting regarding the multi-country monkeypox outbreak held on 23 Jun [2022], it was recommended that monkeypox should not be declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

Prof Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine, UEA, said:
"From the notes of the meeting published on the WHO website, it is not totally clear how much each of the issues discussed ultimately affected the decision not to declare the current epidemic of monkeypox a PHEIC. It must be stated it is not WHO that makes this decision one way or another, but an independent committee of experts who advise WHO.

"Within the report of the Deliberative session, there are some hints of the reasoning behind the committee's decision of which the following seem to be to have been given prominence:
- That the epidemic seems to be plateauing or there are downward trends in some (non-endemic) countries affected early in the international epidemic.
- "... the potential for exacerbation of the stigmatization and infringement of human rights, including the rights to privacy, non-discrimination, physical and mental health, of affected population groups, which would further impede response efforts".
- "Additional knowledge gaps and areas of uncertainty, for which more information is needed rapidly to support a more comprehensive assessment of the public health risk of this event, include: transmission modes; full spectrum of clinical presentation; infectious period; reservoir species and potential for reverse zoonoses; the possibility of virus; and access to vaccines and antivirals and their efficacy in humans".

"In those non-endemic countries with more than 30 cases reported up to 24 Jun [2022], there is not much evidence to my mind that cases numbers really are plateauing. In any epidemic following a single or small number of events, you often see a primary wave of people who contacted their infections at one of these 'point sources'. This is then followed by a further wave of secondary infections. Depending on the serial interval and incubation period of the infection, these waves may merge into one or give a false appearance that the epidemic may be plateauing or be in retreat. You can see this in the epidemic curve by reporting date (below). So, I think the suggestion of plateauing/decline is being overly optimistic.

"I am not sure how declaring monkeypox a PHEIC would exacerbate stigmatization or infringe human rights.

"Although there are certainly knowledge gaps about monkeypox and the current epidemic, I do think we know enough to have a pretty good idea of what is driving this epidemic and how it could best be controlled. The recent decision by Canada and the UK to start to offer vaccine to high-risk MSM individuals is a very important step in the right direction.

"Ultimately whether a PHEIC was declared or not will not have a huge impact on the current epidemic as those non-epidemic countries with many cases are already taking steps to control the problem in their countries. However, there are 2 areas where I think it would have helped. Firstly, the drive to increase vaccine manufacture and purchase may be reinforced by a PHEIC. Secondly, such a declaration may help towards improving the flow of support into those African countries that are having a difficult time with endemic Monkeypox such as Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has seen monkeypox kill at least 58 people and infect over 1200 others since the start of the year (https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/monkeypox-kills-58-infects-over-1-200-in-dr-congo-since-january-who/2593348).

"In any event I suspect that over the next 2 weeks we shall see the overall epidemic outside of Africa continue to grow and possibly accelerate and a PHEIC declared sometime in the next few weeks."

Professor Gordon Dougan, Director of Infectious Diseases at Wellcome, said:
"This outbreak is another reminder of our shared vulnerability to infectious disease. Rather than firefighting, we need to work internationally to prevent future infections like COVID and monkeypox from escalating.

"Governments do not need to wait for an official declaration to begin acting in a coordinated and measured way. Where cases have been identified, rapid public health responses such as enhanced disease surveillance, contact tracing, and self-isolation will be crucial. But with the virus continuing to spread, all countries must step up, integrate their preparations, and help those with limited capability.

"The world must not repeat any mistakes of the past 2 years. Even though mass vaccination is not recommended, some nations have begun rushing to acquire doses. But while high-income countries are now paying attention to this virus, monkeypox has been affecting people in West and Central Africa for decades. And with new cases now being reported in other low- and middle-income countries, we must ensure that these lifesaving tools are equitably distributed to where they are needed most.

"If we are to control outbreaks earlier, we need governments, funders, regulators, and industry to sustain momentum. This includes establishing clinical trials of the required scale and design for improved monkeypox vaccines and treatments.

"The G7 Summit is a test for world leaders. The risk of new infectious diseases emerging and escaping out of control is rising. But by working together and implementing bold reforms, we can transform our global surveillance, research, and manufacturing capabilities and deliver tests, treatments, and vaccines to those who need them, saving as many lives as possible."
