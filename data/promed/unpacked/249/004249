A total of 3 cases of suspected food poisoning have been investigated
in the Inverness area after being diagnosed on Wednesday [15 Apr
2009] night with illness caused by toxins produced in fresh fish like
tuna and mackerel that has not been stored at correct temperatures.
Symptoms including sweating, headaches, diarrhea and nausea can
appear within minutes and last up to 12 hours, but are thought to
have no long term consequences.

NHS Highland and Highland Council's environmental health team
describe it as "scombroxtin" food poisoning and have established a
link to fresh tuna steaks bought from Tesco Extra in Inverness
Business and Retail Park.

The supermarket has withdrawn the product and anyone who bought it on
Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday [13-15 April 2009] is asked to throw it
away or return it to the store.

[Scombroid fish poisoning occurs after eating fish with high levels
of accumulated histamine or other biogenic amines. Histamine is
produced and can accumulate when bacterial enzymes metabolize
naturally occurring histidine in fish. This most often occurs when
fish is held at ambient or high temperatures (such as 70 to 90 deg F
/ 21.1 to 32.2 deg C) for several hours, but can occur at more
moderate temperatures (over 45 deg F or over 7.2 deg C). Rapid
chilling of fish immediately after catch is the most effective
measure to prevent scombroid fish poisoning. Fish from the family
_Scombridae_ (such as tuna and mackerel) contain high levels of free
histidine in muscle tissue and are the commonest sources of scombroid
fish poisoning, but other fish (such as mahi mahi, amberjack,
bluefish, abalone, and sardines) also have been implicated.

It should be noted that those taking isoniazid (INH) might have more
significant reactions because of the drug's histaminase inhibition in
the GI tract. (See: Miki M, Ishiwara T, Okayamai H. An outbreak of
histamine poisoning after ingestion of the ground saury paste in 8
patients taking isoniazid in tuberculous ward. Internal Medicine
2005; 44: 1133-6 (available at
<http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/internalmedicine/44/11/1133/_pdf>).
