A confirmed case of bovine tuberculosis (TB) has been reported in
Eddy County, according to officials from the New Mexico Livestock
Board.
State veterinarian, David Fly, reported that the New Mexico Livestock
Board and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are conducting an
investigation. The infected dairy cow was discovered during routine
testing, known as slaughter surveillance, which is conducted at all
state and federally inspected plants in the United States. Fly said,
"We are doing everything we can to minimize the impact on our
livestock industry in New Mexico."
There is also a beef herd under surveillance in north eastern New
Mexico for possible exposure to TB, Fly said.
Quay County producer and former New Mexico Cattle Growers Association
president, Phil H. Bidegain, feels the news will have an impact
because of the costs incurred for testing of the livestock. "I'm not
sure it will affect the beef market, but it will affect producers,"
Bidegain said.
Officials and beef and dairy producers are concerned about the
outcome concerning the new developments of TB. An outbreak could
potentially cost producers an estimated $3 million for testing, Fly
said.
According to New Mexico State University Extension dairy specialist,
Robert Hagevoort, steps by qualified personnel will be taken to
prevent the spread of the disease. "We brush with it all the time. We
need to make sure we do what is correct before panic sets in and the
alarm bells ring," he said.
Currently the TB zone that is in portions of Roosevelt and Curry
counties remains under TB-free status. A small portion of the zone is
under heightened oversight known as advanced accreditation status
from the previous outbreak, Fly said. Cattle within that zone are
subject to testing before they can be shipped outside the zone. "We
are working diligently to prevent a status change," Fly said.
At a low level in the United States, the last case of TB was reported
more than 2 years ago in New Mexico. A management plan has been put
into place and is being followed according to established rules in
the Code of Federal Regulations, Fly said, and added that all
appropriate measures have been taken to ensure there is no risk to
public health or livestock.

[The majority of New Mexico is classified as a tuberculosis-free
state. There is a relatively small zone classified as modified
accredited advanced in the southeastern part of the state. NM
Livestock Board reported there were no active cases in NM. A state
must be free for a certain period of time before it can apply for its
TB-free status. This may affect the time line that NM was on to
achieve that status.
Clearly, the state will start to trace where the animals in this herd
came from, as well as where any cattle from the herd may have been
shipped. This will be a busy time for the officials in NM.
The portion of the state that is designated as modified accredited
advanced can be seen on:
