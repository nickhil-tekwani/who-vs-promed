Highly pathogenic avian influenza took a warm, 3-month-long break but has returned to Wisconsin.

The Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection says the most recent case was confirmed Friday [14 Oct 2022] and is a backyard flock of 7 birds in St. Croix County.

Another 115 birds were depopulated from a non-commercial flock in Washington County in August [2022]. DATCP says 70 000 turkeys were depopulated from 2 commercial farms in Dunn County after the disease was detected on 27 Sep [2022] and 10 000 ducks were depopulated from 2 commercial farms in Racine County after HPAI was found on 26 Sep [2022].

The agency is asking people working around poultry to use enhanced biosecurity practices and keep the birds indoors to avoid exposure to wild birds if possible.

It's not every day the typical Texan comes into direct contact with a wild bird, but state wildlife experts are still warning hunters, animal rehabilitators, and urban farmers that highly pathogenic avian influenza is back.

The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department on Tuesday [18 Oct 2022] announced a flock of backyard poultry in Dallas County tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, a disease typically carried and spread by wild aquatic birds. Those wild birds are usually just carriers and don't experience signs, but they can quickly infect domestic birds, like chickens, through direct contact or contaminated cages, water, and feed.

Backyard chickens can be at risk of being infected with avian flu by wild birds.

Once infected, those domestic birds can experience diarrhea, lethargy, coughing, sneezing, stumbling, and sudden death, according to wildlife officials. Pigs can also be infected with avian flu, but it's unlikely to spread to other animals.

"Millions of domestic birds have been destroyed in the last few years in an attempt to control the spread of the viruses to animals and humans," the Texas Department of State Health Services says on its website. "Avian flu can strike poultry quickly without any warning signs of infection. Once flu infects a poultry flock, it frequently becomes established, and it can spread rapidly from flock to flock."

The good news is the risk of avian flu spreading to humans is currently low, with just one case confirmed in the United States this year [2022], according to health officials. Most people who have caught avian flu in the past have had close contact with infected birds, like people working on poultry farms, according to state health experts.

"Scientists know avian and human influenza viruses can exchange genes when a person is infected with viruses from both species at the same time," state health officials say in an online fact sheet about avian flu. "This process of gene swapping inside the human body can give rise to a completely new subtype of the influenza virus."

The health officials warn "scientists are concerned the lack of natural immunity and the lack of effective vaccines against a new virus could lead to a pandemic," and "national and international agencies are taking steps for dealing with this possibility."

The current outbreak in Dallas County is likely linked to the annual fall migration for some aquatic birds, with Texas Parks and Wildlife Department officials adding that "the public can assist in interrupting HPAI transmission by limiting all unnecessary contact with wild birds."

Earlier this year [2022], HPAI was discovered in a bald eagle and a horned owl in Texas, wildlife officials said.

Nationwide, more than 47 million cases of the avian flu have been counted among poultry and 2930 among wild birds. A total of 46 states have confirmed cases among wild birds, while 42 states have poultry infections, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Those gearing up for hunting season in November [2022] should be extra careful when disposing of carcasses, according to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. They should also wear gloves when processing the meat and avoid handling or eating any bird that looks sickly.

"They should also disinfect tools between carcasses using a 10% bleach solution and should cook meat to the proper temperature of 165 deg F [about 74 deg C]," a statement from the department said.

Wildlife rehabilitators, when taking in birds needing their help, should also look for signs consistent with bird flu and quarantine them if needed to limit any potential exposure.

If you stumble upon a sick or dead bird, call Texas Parks and Wildlife Department officials, or the Texas Animal Health Commission.

[3] California (San Diego County): black swan

https://www.foxnews.com/health/bird-flu-has-arrived-san-diego-county


The 1st case of bird flu has made its way to San Diego County as the infectious disease spreads across the country.

The carcass of a deceased black swan that was discovered last week at Lake San Marcos has tested positive for avian flu, according to the San Diego Union Tribune.

An unknown party discovered the body and submitted it to the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory in San Bernardino, a spokesperson for the California Department of Food and Agriculture, told local media outlets. After laboratory tests were conducted, samples from the body were confirmed positive for avian flu.

The sample will be transferred to National Veterinary Services Laboratories overseen by the United States Department of Agriculture in Ames, Iowa, to determine the strain of the virus.

The United States is currently undergoing one of the worst bird flu outbreaks in years. As previously reported, 47.6 million birds have been affected this year [2022], with the disease spreading to 42 states, according to data provided by the USDA.

More than 5 million birds in the US have died from the disease between January to July of this year [2022]. Infections and deaths have led to export bans, turkey shortages, and lower production of eggs while adding to the increasing food prices.

Avian influenza is a highly contagious pathogen that can spread from bird to bird, usually through bodily fluids, and affects their neurological and respiratory systems. Wild birds have spread the disease more than usual this year [2022] due to migration.

However, it is extremely rare for a human to become infected by bird flu, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

[4] California (Riverside County): geese

Avian flu has been detected in Riverside County, where officials announced [Thu 20 Oct 2022] as 2 sick geese in the Perris area had tested positive.

Avian influenza has been seen in wild and domestic birds across the US and was anticipated to strike locally, a Riverside County Animal Services news release states.

The geese were impounded by the county's Department of Animal Services last week and humanely euthanized due to their advanced decline, departmental spokesperson John Welsh said. Officials got confirmation of the positive results late Tuesday [18 Oct 2022], the release states. This strain of flu was first detected in the United States in the east in January [2022].

"As wild birds migrated to the West, California counties started detecting cases," states the release, which adds that the 1st California cases were seen in July [2022].

The flu strain is sickening and killing a wider range of wild bird species than with previous avian influenza outbreaks, the release states. The species affected include waterfowl, raptor predators, and scavengers such as vultures and gulls. Domestic birds, such as chickens, are especially vulnerable.

Infection in these species is almost always fatal, and there is no vaccine or treatment, according to the release.

"Although we just have these 2 positive cases so far, the disease is considered widespread in the Inland Empire, and further cases will likely emerge as testing continues," Riverside County Chief Veterinarian Dr. Sara Strongin said in the release.

Neighboring counties began reporting positive cases in recent weeks, Riverside County animal services officials said in the release.

According to the Department of Food and Agriculture, there were no reported animal cases in San Bernardino County as of Tuesday [18 Oct 2022].

Los Angeles County officials on Monday [17 Oct 2022] announced that 8 cases of bird flu had been found in wild birds in the county, marking the 1st sign of the virus there.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, the risk of transmission from birds to people is low, the release states. Still, the CDC suggests limiting contact with wild birds and sick or dead poultry.

The California Department of Fish & Wildlife echoed that exposure risk to humans is low. However, people working in capacities where bird-handling is common, such as the poultry industry, were urged to take precautions provided by public health officials.

"Wild bird species at highest risk of infection include waterfowl (swans, geese, diving ducks), waterbirds (gulls, terns, cranes, herons, shorebirds), and birds that prey or scavenge on these species, such as eagles, hawks, falcons, corvids, and vultures," the Fish & Wildlife department said.

Domestic chickens and turkeys can also be infected, usually from exposure to saliva, feces, and respiratory droplets of viral wild game. Virus particles can also attach and rub off in feathers, footwear, and vehicles, that department said.

There was no mention of H5N1 being transmitted through cooked poultry or turkey.

Sick or dead poultry, domestic ducks, and pet birds should be reported to the California Department of Food & Agriculture at 866-922-2473.

[5] Utah (Sanpete County): turkeys

http://cachevalleydaily.com/news/archive/2022/10/20/avian-flu-continues-to-attack-turkey-farms-and-backyard-flocks/#.Y1PohXZByN0


Avian flu is still working its way across the state with more cases in Cache Valley and more turkey farms in Sanpete County.

The Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) confirmed 6 more cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) on turkey farms in Sanpete County and one small backyard chicken flock in Cache County.

The Cache County chickens were not depopulated, but they were quarantined. So far this season 16 turkey farms have been impacted by the disease this fall. All birds on the turkey farms have been depopulated or quarantined to prevent further spread of the disease.

The UDAF and USDA is still investigating the situations in these areas and will be closely monitoring efforts to contain the disease and prevent further spreading.

Bailee Woolstenhulme, public information officer for the UDAF, said the public should stay away from farms with known cases as well as any locations where officials are working to contain the disease to avoid coming in contact with HPAI.

"As long as the fall migration continues, we encourage all domestic bird owners, including people with backyard chickens, to keep up their biosecurity measures," she said. "Biosecurity measures will not only help up your birds, they will help other bird owner's flocks as well."

UDAF is asking for the public's help to prepare for a continued increase of HPAI cases.

Domestic flocks include all chicken, ducks, geese, turkeys, gamebirds, etc. These should strengthen their biosecurity practices. If possible, birds should be kept locked inside enclosures to avoid contact with migratory birds. Flocks should not have shared water, feed, or grazing sources with wild bird habitats.

All poultry production operations from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to insure the health of their birds.

USDA has several different materials available that explain how to upgrade biosecurity measures including videos, checklists, and a toolkit available at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/defend-the-flock-program/dtf-resources/dtf-resources.

Some indicators of HPAI in flocks are high death loss, nasal discharge, decreased appetite or water consumption, and lack of coordination in birds. If birds are experiencing any of these signs, it should be reported to the state veterinarian immediately at <statevet@utah.gov>.

HPAI detections do not cause an immediate public health concern for people, said US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials. Only one human case of the HPAI strain of HPAI has been detected in the United States.

https://abc11.com/avian-flu-high-path-influenza-wake-county-positive-case/12357162/


The North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is warning the public after a backyard chicken flock in Wake County tested positive for high path avian influenza (HPAI).

The positive sample was identified by the department's lab in Raleigh and is the 1st confirmed positive in a backyard flock in North Carolina.

The Department of Agriculture said the flock of less than 100 birds will be killed to prevent spread of the disease, and other backyard flocks located near the infected flock will be contacted.

According to the department, HPAI was found at 9 poultry farms in Johnston and Wayne counties in late spring and early summer of this year [2022].

CDC officials said this type of HPAI virus is considered a low risk to people, but is highly contagious to other birds, including commercial and backyard flocks of poultry. The virus is also not considered a food safety threat, and infected birds do not enter the food supply.

The department ask if your bird becomes sick to report it to a veterinarian right away or contact the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

Below is a list of warning signs of HPAI

- reduced energy, decreased appetite, and/or decreased activity
- lower egg production and/or soft-shelled or misshapen eggs
- swelling of the head, eyelids, comb, and wattles
- purple discoloration of the wattles, comb, and legs
- difficulty breathing, runny nares (nose), and/or sneezing
- twisting of the head and neck, stumbling, falling down, tremors, and/or circling
- greenish diarrhea

[The Kodak company had a slogan that said, "The gift that keeps on giving," referring to photos and memories. Well, this disease, avian influenza, is the disease that keeps on taking.

I am most sorry for the producers, but also for those who are tasked with the depopulation of pet birds, or commercial birds. The continued losses for the producers and the continued euthanasia for the birds is hard on those performing the task as often as it has occurred this year [2022].

Although it is autumn, it does not mean we won't see this disease in the spring as the spring migration occurs. Hopefully, producers can use the winter to brainstorm and harden their biosecurity to make their birds safer.

In the meantime, keep the biosecurity high. Protect your birds. - Mod.TG
