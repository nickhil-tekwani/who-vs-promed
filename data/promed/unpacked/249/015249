India: outbreak of undiagnosed illness in Manipur
-----------------------------------------------
[The following report, describing an outbreak of illness in the Tamenglong
district of Manipur, is reproduced below. The outbreak is attributed to
hantavirus infection, but, the symptoms of the illness (vomiting, stomach
pains, and fever) are not those normally associated with hantavirus
infection. Furthermore, the statement that the hantavirus causing the
disease "breeds in an edible fungus" is clearly absurd. Plants, or fungi,
are not competent hosts for any known virus maintained in a vertebrate
host. ProMED-mail would appreciate further information on the nature of
this outbreak. It is not clear even that an infectious agent is involved,
and, it may be that the term virus is used in its original sense, meaning
"a poison". - Mod.CP]
As of 20 Jul 2004, many people in the Tousem sub-divisions, in Tamenglong
district, are reported to be hospitalized, after they were infected by the
dreaded hantavirus, which is believed to breed in Uchina, an edible fungi,
which sprouts on trees.
According to reports received from Tamenglong, half the members of one
family in the Tousem subdivisions are presently hospitalized, and,
undergoing treatment at the Community Health Center. The exact number of
people affected by the virus, however, has not been determined, although
the reports claimed that many people of the sub-divisions have been
infected by the virus. Vomiting, stomach ache, and fever are said to be
some of the symptoms of the infection.
A team of doctors and nurses from Tamenglong district have also rushed in
with medicine to assist with controlling the outbreak. Meanwhile, another
report said that the Tamenglong district administration had provided 9
boats, and food, for the marooned people living along the border of Tousem
and Tamenglong, since transport and communication has been stopped
following the collapse of the bridge built across the Barak river.
