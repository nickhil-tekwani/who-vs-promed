New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture Charles M. Kuperus today [18 Sep
2006] announced that the death of a 6-year-old mare in Burlington
County has been attributed to Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and
the death of a 14-year-old mare in Middlesex County was caused by
West Nile virus (WNV). These are the first 2 deaths to occur from
these equine illnesses in 2006.
Neither horse was vaccinated for the mosquito-borne infection it
succumbed to. The Middlesex County [WNV] horse became ill on
September 6th and was euthanatized on 7 Sep 2006. The Burlington
County [EEE] horse became ill on 8 Sep and was euthanatized on 9 Sep.
Secretary Kuperus said, "Even though we are seeing [fewer and fewer]
cases every year, owners still need to be diligent in vaccinating
their animals."
"We strongly recommend that horse owners take preventative steps to
protect their animals from the potentially deadly diseases of West
Nile Virus and Eastern Equine Encephalitis," said Secretary Kuperus.
"It is important to note that the vaccine for West Nile virus does
not protect horses against EEE and vice-versa, so both vaccines are
necessary to keep the animals safe." [There is a combination vaccine
available but it must be specifically asked for, so the veterinarian
understands that the owner is wanting to protect the animal against
multiple viruses. - Mod.TG]
There were no cases of West Nile virus in horses and 4 cases of EEE
in 2005. That is compared with 6 cases each of West Nile virus and
EEE in 2004. One horse had both diseases that year. In 2003, there
were 150 cases of West Nile virus and 8 cases of EEE.
West Nile virus is a viral disease that affects horses' neurological
systems. Horses contract the virus when infected mosquitoes bite
them. The disease cannot be spread from horse to horse or from an
infected horse to humans or domestic pets.
EEE is a rare but serious disease that causes inflammation of the
brain tissue and has a significantly higher risk of death than West
Nile infection.
For more information about West Nile virus and EEE in horses, visit
the New Jersey Department of Agriculture web site at
<http://www.nj.gov/agriculture/divisions/ah/diseases/equine.html>.
Effective equine vaccines for West Nile virus and EEE have been
available for several years. Horse owners should contact their
veterinarians now if their horses are not already up-to-date on their
vaccinations against both EEE and West Nile virus.
West Nile virus and EEE, like other viral diseases affecting horses'
neurological systems, must be reported to the state veterinarian at
609/292-3965 within 48 hours.

specifically asked for. The clinical signs of these diseases may
initially look similar. Although the number of cases is dropping, it
is still very important to vaccinate against these viruses. - Mod.TG]
