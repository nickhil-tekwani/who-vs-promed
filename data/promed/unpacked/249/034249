The number of sylvan [jungle] yellow fever [YF] deaths in Rio Grande
do Sul increased to 3 with the confirmation of another victim in
Santo Angelo, in the northwest region of the state.

According to the State Center of Health Surveillance (CEVS), there
were 6 suspected [YF] cases, but 3 have now been discarded [as
negative]. Of the cases which resulted in death, 2 occurred in Santo
Angelo and one in San Borja.

According to the CEVS investigators, yellow fever has been [suspected]
in 318 dead monkeys in the northwest region of the state. An intensive
vaccination campaign against the disease is being conducted in the
region. Up to the present, 1.3 million doses of [YF] vaccine have
already been released to cover the population of the municipal areas
affected as well as those traveling in this region.

The Health Ministry is also working with the state Secretariat of
Health of Rio Grande do Sul to intensify the vaccination strategy in
the state. The 1st cases of the resurgence of yellow fever were
reported in 2002 in western Rio Grande do Sul state, where the 1st
campaign was carried out.

This sylvan outbreak of yellow fever, with mortality of both humans
and monkeys, continues in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil in this area near
the border of Argentina. One hopes that the rapid application of YF
virus vaccine will preclude spill-over of the sylvan cycle of YF
virus transmission into an urban cycle involving _Aedes aegypti_
mosquitoes.
