Around 150 white-tailed deer have died of some sort of disease in north central Idaho and it isn't clear what is causing it according to game officials.

Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials in the Clearwater region said reports continue to come in of dead deer in the Kamiah area, as of [13 Aug 2021]. So far, tests for bluetongue and epizootic hemorrhagic disease, and adenovirus hemorrhagic disease have come back negative in the corpses tested.

People in the area have been asked to report any dead or sick deer to Idaho Fish and Game. Officials have asked people to remove food and water sources that may cause deer to congregate out of a concern that whatever is making the animals sick is spreading from animal to animal. Idaho Fish and Game first reported deer had been dying of some sort of illness on [5 Aug 2021] and began running tests. Idaho Fish and Game said it appeared to be a localized situation.

[Hemorrhagic disease (HD) in cervids, caused by viruses in either the epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) group or the bluetongue virus (BTV) group, is the most important disease of white-tailed deer and is more common in the eastern USA. In western states, an adenovirus (CdAdV-1 or OdAdV-1) causes fatal hemorrhagic disease in black-tailed deer and moose. Tests to detect those diseases were negative and there are no data on signs or pathological findings to speculate a possible cause. We await the results of any studies being conducted by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. - Mod.PMB
