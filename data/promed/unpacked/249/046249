[Now that the incidence in the UK of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease --
abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail -- shows evidence of
having peaked, or, at least of having reached a plateau, the Department of
Health's full table of definite and probable CJD deaths and referrals will
no longer be reproduced in ProMED-mail. Only the monthly summary of variant
CJD statistics will be posted, unless there is a substantial change in the
situation. The full table, updated monthly, can be accessed at the
Department of Health website:
<http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/08/35/86/04083586.pdf>.
The precise definition of the terms deaths, definite cases, probable vCJD
cases, and, the case definitions can be found by accessing the Department
of Health web-site, or by referring to a previous ProMED-mail post in this
thread (for example, CJD (new var.) - UK: update Mar 2002 20020305.3693) -

Monthly variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics as of Mon 4 Oct 2004
----------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is today [Wed 6 Oct 2004] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), the form
of the disease thought to be linked to BSE. The position is as follows:
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK:
Summary of vCJD cases - deaths
------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 104
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 38
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 2
Total number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 144
Summary of vCJD cases - alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 5
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 149
(The next update will be published on Mon 1 Nov 2004)
[Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Mon 6 Sep 2004, the
number of deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation
pending) has increased by 2, raising the total number of deaths from
definite or probable vCJD to 144. The number of probable vCJD cases still
alive remains at 5. Therefore the overall total number of definite or
probable vCJD cases now becomes 149. - Mod.CP]

UK: thousands warned over vCJD risk
-----------------------------------
Thousands of people are to receive letters warning them they may have been
exposed to vCJD through contaminated blood products. The CJD Incidents
Panel says about 4000 in the UK, mostly haemophiliacs, are thought to be at
risk. The patients may have received blood products, such as clotting
agents, from donors who subsequently developed vCJD. But the government is
stressing the risk is very low, and relates to people exposed to blood
products before 1999, when precautions were brought in.
9 donors have been identified as having developed vCJD after giving blood.
Their donations would have gone into plasma pools that would have been
diluted by thousands of other donations. The CJD Incidents Panel said this
diluting would reduce the risk of contamination. In total, 6000 letters are
to be sent out informing patients of the risk assessment -- although only
2/3 are being told they may be at direct risk. There is no test for the
brain-wasting disease, so those at risk have no way of knowing whether they
have vCJD. In addition to haemophiliacs, a small number of people with
immune system disorders will receive the letters.
Government scientists say more work is needed to determine the exact risk
each individual has been exposed to. But those at risk will be told not to
donate blood, and to inform doctors and dentists if they undergo treatment
in the future in a bid to stop further onward transmission. Professor Don
Jeffries, acting chair of the CJD Incidents Panel, said: "In the interests
of public safety, we have been advised to take the most precautionary measure."
Sir Liam Donaldson, the chief medical officer, said the risk needed to be
looked at in context of the exposure the public has had to BSE in the 1980s
and 1990s through meat. "The entire population of the UK was exposed to a
massive risk of vCJD through eating [BSE-contaminated] products." And
Professor Noel Gill, of the Health Protection Agency, which is coordinating
the informing of patients, said: "The bottom line is that we are taking
this precaution to minimise patient-to-patient transmission. The price of
that is that a number of patients get a letter saying they could be at
risk. This is clearly quite an overwhelming piece of information to come to
them."
Health secretary John Reid launched the review of vCJD infection risk in
December 2003 after announcing that a person had died from the human form
of BSE after receiving blood from a donor who later developed the disease.
A 2nd person who had received a blood transfusion has subsequently died
from other causes but had signs of vCJD in the spleen. The government has
already identified 17 people who received blood transfusions from people
who went on to develop vCJD. Since 1997 all cases of vCJD that are reported
to the National CJD Surveillance Unit and diagnosed as having "probable"
vCJD are passed on to the National Blood Service, which searches its blood
donor records. If the patient has given blood, any stocks of that blood are
immediately destroyed. White blood cells, which are thought to carry the
greatest risk of transmitting the disease, have been removed from all blood
used for transfusion since 1999.
And blood products have been prepared from plasma imported from the US
since 1998. Graham Whitehead, the chief executive of the Haemophilia
Society, said the news would cause anxiety, especially in the wake of HIV
and hepatitis C infection from blood products. But he said it must be put
in context. "It is very reassuring that no-one in the world with
haemophilia has been diagnosed with vCJD."
Any person with concerns can ring a dedicated NHS Direct helpline on 0845
850 9850 for England and Wales, and NHS 24 on 0845 4242424 in Scotland and
Northern Ireland.

vCJD and plasma products: implementation of public health precautions in
the UK
---------------------------------------------------------
The CJD Incidents Panel (CJDIP), a United Kingdom expert committee set up
to advise on the management of "incidents" of potential transmission of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) between patients, has issued recommendations on
the management of variant CJD (vCJD) risk from implicated plasma products.
To date, 9 UK plasma donors are known to have developed vCJD. Collectively,
they made 23 plasma donations. The donated plasma was used to manufacture
factor VIII, factor IX, antithrombin, intravenous immunoglobulin G,
albumin, intramuscular human normal immunoglobulin, and anti-D.
The potential risk of vCJD infection following treatment with any
implicated plasma products, on top of the risk from dietary exposure to the
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent, is very uncertain. So far,
there are no recorded instances of vCJD being spread through surgery, nor
have there been any cases among recipients of plasma products sourced from
individuals who later developed vCJD. In December 2003, the death from vCJD
of a person some years after receiving a blood transfusion from a donor who
had died of vCJD was announced (1). In July 2004 a 2nd probable case of
transfusion-associated vCJD infection was identified (2). These 2 events
have increased concern about the potential infectivity of blood and plasma
products.
The CJDIP now recommends that certain special public health precautions
need to be taken for some recipients of UK-sourced plasma products that
were manufactured using donations from individuals who subsequently
developed vCJD. This is in order to reduce any possible risk of iatrogenic
transmission of vCJD.
The CJDIP has used a vCJD blood risk assessment,
(<http://www.dnv.com/consulting/news_consulting/RiskofInfectionfromvariantCJDinBlood.asp>),
together with information on how the particular batches of plasma products
were manufactured, to assess the potential levels of infection that
patients were exposed to.
The CJDIP advises certain special public health precautions need to be
taken for recipients of UK sourced plasma products who have been exposed to
a 1 per cent or greater potential additional risk of vCJD infection, as
these patients could pose a risk to others in defined circumstances. These
at-risk patients are asked: (a) not to donate blood, organs or tissues, (b)
to inform their clinician if they need medical, surgical or dental
treatment, so that infection control precautions can be taken to reduce any
possible risk of spreading vCJD, and to consider informing their family, in
case they (the patients) need emergency surgery in the future
<http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/acdp/tseguidance/>.
The CJDIP has categorised each batch of implicated plasma products
according to the likelihood that special public health precautions need to
be taken as follows: (a) High: the amount of potential infectivity in
product batches was high enough to warrant special public health
precautions following the administration of a very small dose. These
batches should be traced, and the recipients advised of their exposure and
asked to take special public health precautions. (b) Medium: substantial
quantities of the material in question would need to have been administered
to warrant special public health precautions. Efforts should be made to
trace these batches and assess the additional risk to individual recipients
to determine whether pecial precautions should be taken. (c) Low: the
potential additional risk to recipients is considered negligible. These
batches do not need to be traced and the individual recipients do not need
to be informed.
This categorisation is based on very cautious assumptions, and the
uncertainties underlying the assessment of 'risk' are great. The CJDIP
guidance is to limit any possible iatrogenic human-to-human transmission of
vCJD. It should NOT be interpreted as an estimate of an individual
patient's additional risk of developing vCJD, which is uncertain, and
likely to be very low.
The patients who may be affected include some with bleeding disorders, some
patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID), and some patients with other
conditions, who may include, for example, patients with secondary
immunodeficiencies, certain neurological and autoimmune conditions, plasma
exchange recipients and patients with severe burns, and with some other
conditions requiring critical care. Patients in the UK who are 'at-risk' of
vCJD for public health purposes are being contacted by their doctors and
informed of the precautions they will need to take.
The product manufacturers are providing details to individual countries to
which parts of batches with a 'High' or 'Medium' likelihood that public
health precautions might be required were exported. The UK Department of
Health and the Health Protection Agency are providing further details to
authoritative bodies in these countries as well as to the European
Commission and WHO. The Health Protection Agency's (HPA) CJD section at the
Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre is coordinating the patient
notification in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The Scottish Centre
for Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH) is coordinating this
notification in Scotland. Background information about vCJD with useful
links is available from their websites: HPA:

India: tainted blood products received from the UK
--------------------------------------------------
Britain has exported blood products that could be contaminated with the
human form of mad cow disease to at least 11 countries, including India,
raising fears of further transmission of the deadly condition, a leading
daily reported on Mon 27 Sep 2004.
Officials last week contacted 5 of the countries identified as most at risk
from the imported blood products, which were donated by 9 people who died
from variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (vCJD), The Times reported. However,
the government has been accused of "lethal secrecy" after refusing to
identify publicly the 5 nations which have been the subject of risk
assessments by the Health Protection Agency. The exports of the suspect
products were effected in the late 1990s. The warnings have been issued
after 2 British cases discovered in the past year in which people are
thought to have contracted the brain-wasting disease from blood transfusions.
Besides India, where 953 vials of albumin were sent, the other 10 recipient
countries are Ireland (polio vaccine, 83 500 doses), Brazil (44 864 vials
albumin, 80 vials immunoglobulin), Dubai (UAE)(2400 vials albumin), Turkey
(840 vials immunoglobulin), Brunei (400 vials albumin), Egypt (144 vials
albumin), Morocco (100 vials albumin), Oman (100 vials immunoglobulin),
Russia (23 vials factor VIII) and Singapore (3 vials immunoglobulin).

Britain exported potentially dangerous blood products
-----------------------------------------------------
The United Kingdom has exported to "at least 11 countries" blood products
at risk of contamination with the prion responsible for variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), the human form of mad cow disease, The
Times reports. The blood plasma products resulted from donations by 9
people who later died of the incurable disease.
The countries, in order of the number of samples sent, are Singapore (3
samples), Russia (23), Oman (100), Morocco (100), Egypt (144), the
sultanate of Brunei (400), Turkey (840), India (953), Dubai (2400), Brazil
(44 864) and Ireland (83 500). Five of these countries were warned by
Britain's sanitary services, The Times said, but the daily did not know
which. Last week letters went out to 6000 patients in Britain, most of them
haemophiliacs, who may have been exposed to vCJD through blood plasma products.
According to health ministry figures, 141 [144 as of 4 Oct 2004] people are
known to have died in Britain from vCJD, a spongy deterioration of the
brain causing personality change, loss of body function, and eventually
death. Cases of the disease peaked in 2000, when 28 deaths were reported.
Since then the trend has been generally downward, with 17 cases in 2002 and
18 last year. In May government-funded scientists estimated 3800 people in
Britain could be harbouring the human form of mad cow disease without
knowing it.

UK: wife and sister of man die of sporadic CJD
----------------------------------------------
A man today described the deaths of his wife and sister from
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) as a "horrific coincidence". The man's
wife, from Walham Green, Sandhurst, Gloucestershire, died last month after
battling the sporadic form of the brain disease for 9 months.
The man's sister died 2 years ago after contracting the same form of the
disease. Both women were 67 when they died. They were both treated in the
same ward in the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. His wife's walking was
first affected before her memory started to go. He said latterly she got
very angry and violent due to her frustration at the disease.
Her husband, a retired fitter who is 70, said: "I feel terrible. I can't
believe it. I feel completely in the dark and have no idea whatsoever why
they died." CJD Support Network co-ordinator Gill Turner said there was one
in a million cases of this form of the disease. She said every case of the
disease is looked at by the CJD incident panel and believed the findings of
these deaths would be "very interesting". "The likelihood of such close
non-blood relatives getting CJD would be very unusual," she added.
According to the CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, 993 people have died
of all forms of CJD in Britain between 1990 and 2004. Some 740 of those
deaths were attributed to sporadic CJD, the most common form of the disease.
