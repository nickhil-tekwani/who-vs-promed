Hepatitis Toll Towers Close to 1000 in Bulgaria's Plovdiv
--------------------
Bulgaria's second largest city of Plovdiv is seeing hepatitis
epidermics spreading out, the number of registered cases up to 916,
Darik News revealed on Sunday.
Seven new cases have been registered in one of Bulgaria's poorest
Roma ghettos Stolipinovo.
The infection erupted first in the Roma district of Sheker mahala and
Stolipinovo, but later spread to non-Roma people in the city as well,
because families of the infected did not observe any preventive measures.

[The outbreak of hepatitis in Bulgaria's 2nd city of Plovdiv,
recently confirmed as due to hepatitis A virus infection, has not yet
been contained. The number of cases has increased from 607 on 4 Sep
2006 to 916 on 24 Sep 2006. The outbreak initially affected the
Stolipinovo and Sheker Mahala Roma quarters of the city, but has
since spread more widely. An immunisation programme is being
initiated, but its current status is unknown. Travellers to Bulgaria,
and Plovdiv in particular, should seek prior vaccination for their
own protection.
Plovdiv is located in south-central Bulgaria. A map of Bulgaria can
