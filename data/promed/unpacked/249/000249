Avian infectious laryngotracheitis - Norway (Date of last previously
reported outbreak: 1971).
Text of a communication received on 13 August 1998 from Dr G. Bakken, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Royal Ministry of Agriculture, Oslo:
Infectious laryngotracheitis was diagnosed in a pheasant in a non
commercial poultry flock. The diagnosis (July 1998) was based on the
pathological examination of a bird which presented signs of respiratory
disease and on positive serology of other poultry on the same farm. One of
the contact flock has also been found to be seropositive.
Location: Eidsvoll municipality, Akershus county
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: the source of infection has not
yet been identified; epidemiological investigations are continuing.
B. Other epidemiological details: the national surveillance programme for
infectious laryngotracheitis has shown that commercial poultry breeding
stocks are seronegative.
Control measures during reporting period: isolation of the farm and
stamping out has been performed. The buildings and immediate surroundings
will be disinfected. All contacts have been isolated and examined by
serology. Stamping out will be performed in seropositive contact flock. In
Norway, infectious laryngotracheitis is defined as a "List A" disease, and
stamping out is always applied following the discovery of a serologically
confirmed case.
