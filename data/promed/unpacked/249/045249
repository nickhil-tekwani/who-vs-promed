The number of people hospitalized following an outbreak of cholera in the West Nile districts of Moyo and Adjumani is now over 92, health officials have said. And the infection has caused the death of one more person, a 45-year-old, bringing the number of the dead to 5. Dr. Dominic Lomureju, the Moyo district health inspector, said the number of admissions at the Obongi Health Centre IV (the main health facility containing the epidemic) were now 90, with 28 cases discharged.

Two more cases are admitted at the Lefori Health Centre III, in Lefori Sub County, Dr. Jimmy Opigo, the district health officer said. Drani Buga Geoffrey, the in-charge of the health centre, said the 2 admitted were children aged 5 and 9.

The cholera epidemic, which was 1st reported on 26 Apr [2014] in Obongi County, presents with high fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting, resulting in dehydration. If untreated, it can kill. Opigo said the disease was likely to spread to the rest of Moyo district if measures like sensitizing the local people about sanitation and proper disposal of human feces, were not made a priority.

In statements to the Lusa agency, the chief of the department of public health, the Provincial Director of Health of Luanda, Regina Anthony, said that the outbreak struck mostly the area of Cuca, in the commune of Hojis. According to Regina Antonio, the outbreak was notified at the beginning of March (2014), the deaths having been recorded mostly in children younger than 5 years. She mentioned the late arrival at the hospitals as the reason for more than a dozen deaths, adding that the screening continues to verify the actual number of deaths.

There was no need to do a laboratory study to determine the causative agent of diarrhea and confirmed that it was caused by the bacterium _Shigella_," said the doctor [presumably because of blood in the feces. The URL includes the words "diarreia hemorragica" (hemorrhagic diarrhea - Mod.JW]. As preventive measures, health authorities have moved to that community to identify the actual number of people affected and make recommendations. Diarrhea is the 3rd most severe disease in Angola, after malaria and acute respiratory diseases.

Regina Anthony said that in view of the heavy rains, conducive to the increase in the number of cases of diarrhea, the Ministry of Health has carried out actions of prevention, with emphasis on the areas of greatest risk, which have already recorded outbreaks of cases of cholera. "Our greatest concern is prevention."
