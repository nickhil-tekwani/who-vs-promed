BLASTOCYSTIS HOMINIS - USA ex INDIA: REQUEST FOR INFO

From: "Nancie Cordella" <Nancie.Cordella@es.nemc.org>

I'm the coordinator for a infectious diarrhea study in Boston, MA, USA.
I interviewed and enrolled a patient into the study who complained of
diarrhea since coming back from her vacation in June [1998] from India.
She arrived back home after a short trip and since then she has been
very ill with diarrhea.
We cultured her stool and found _Blastocystis hominis_. I know there is
some controversy regarding if this is a true pathogen or not. Please
e-mail me asap if you have any information regarding this ? pathogen and
if you know how to treat it.
Thank you,
