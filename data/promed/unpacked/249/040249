[2] Summary
Date: Mon 26 Nov 2018
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy) News
[edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/11/ebola-cases-surge-419-treatment-trial-launches


Over the Thanksgiving holiday period and through today [22-26 Nov 2018], the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) reported 33 more Ebola cases, vaulting the total past 400, as the country's health officials announced the launch of the 1st clinical trial of experimental drugs to treat the disease.

Meanwhile, in its latest weekly update on the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) said transmission continues in several North Kivu province cities and villages. Currently, the 3 main hot spots are Kalunguta, located in a security "red zone," Beni, and the Butembo/Katwa area.

The WHO said the Ebola situation in the DRC remains complex and challenging, but it is still confident that the DRC and its partners can successfully contain the outbreak.

Health center exposures, infections in babies
---------------------------------------------
In its update, the WHO said health centers have been identified as a source of disease transmission and that medications given as injections are a notable cause of disease spread. The agency added that efforts are under way to improve infection prevention and control, provide water and products for cleaning, training health providers, and encouraging treatment with medications that don't require injections.

Spread of the virus in health facilities that aren't Ebola treatment centers has occurred in earlier outbreaks, and infections among healthcare workers are known to amplify outbreaks. A recent report noted a spurt of new infections in healthcare workers, and the WHO's latest reports say 39 have been infected so far, at least 10 of them fatally.

Of 36 cases confirmed from [14 Nov to 20 Nov 2018], 7 involved newborn babies and 6 were in children ages 2-17. One of the illnesses was in a pregnant woman. The high numbers of illnesses in children and in women has been an unusual feature of the DRC's outbreak. According to the latest numbers, 61% of confirmed and probable case-patients have been female.

33 new cases, 21 more deaths
----------------------------
In daily updates spanning [22 Nov through 25 Nov 2018], the DRC's health ministry reported 33 more Ebola cases, lifting the total to 419 illnesses, including 372 confirmed and 47 probable cases.

The latest cases were reported in Beni (12), Katwa (9), Kalunguta (5), Butembo (6), and Oicha (1). At this rate, the epidemic will soon surpass the world's 2nd-largest Ebola outbreak ever, which occurred in Uganda in 2000 and involved 425 cases.

In its update today [26 Nov 2018], the health ministry said officials are investigating 59 suspected Ebola cases. Since 21 Nov 2018, the ministry reported 21 more deaths, raising the outbreak's fatality count to 240.

In its [23 Nov 2018] update, the health ministry said that, because of an increase in cases in Butembo and surrounding areas, outbreak coordinators decided to send additional response teams to the areas of Katwa, Kalunguta, and Lubero. The team sent to Lubero will be tasked with strengthening epidemiologic surveillance and training health workers on how to identify and treat suspected cases and high-risk contacts from Butembo.

The ministry said today [26 Nov 2018] that 35 958 people have now been vaccinated. At least 10 110 are frontline health workers.

Treatment trial launch
----------------------
In another new outbreak development, the health ministry said in a 24 Nov 2018 announcement that an ethics committee at the University of Kinshasa has approved a protocol for testing 4 experimental Ebola treatments, which are currently being used on an emergency basis in Ebola treatment centers. They are mAb114, Zmapp, remdesivir, and Regeneron's REGN-EB3 antibody.

The authorization for emergency or compassionate use, however, doesn't provide for the standardized collection of data on the efficacy and safety of each treatment the health ministry said.

The ministry statement indicates that the clinical trial started last week [week of 19 Nov 2018] on 3 of the 4 treatments (Zmapp, mAb114, and remdesivir) at Beni's Ebola treatment center. Future trials could be extended to other sites and include REGN-EB3. However, for now, the other Ebola treatment centers will continue to administer the drugs on a compassionate basis.

As with compassionate use treatment, patients or families will need to give informed consent to participate in clinical trials, but the main difference will be that the choice of treatment will be randomized by lottery rather than selected by doctors.

The number of patients in the trial will depend on how the outbreak evolves and how willing patients are to participate, the ministry said. It added that data in the North Kivu outbreak alone aren't likely to be enough to draw firm conclusions about the treatments, and the clinical trials may extend over 5 years and cover several outbreaks in multiple affected countries.

160 have received experimental treatment
----------------------------------------
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said in a WHO statement today [26 Nov 2018], "While our focus remains on bringing this outbreak to an end, the launch of the randomized control trial in DRC is an important step towards finally finding an Ebola treatment that will save lives."

The WHO said 160 patients in the DRC have already been treated with experimental drugs as part of the emergency use protocol.

The randomized clinical trial protocol is part of a multi-outbreak, multi-country study agreed to in a meeting of experts, partners, and other stakeholders convened by the WHO in October 2018. That meeting resulted in a research and development blueprint for Ebola treatment clinical trials, which is published in a 14-page document on the WHO's website (https://www.who.int/ebola/drc-2018/summary-deliberations-ebola-therapeutics.pdf).

In its statement, the WHO said it is coordinating the trial, which is led and sponsored by the DRC's National Institute for Biomedical Research with its partners at the country's health ministry, the US National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Alliance for International Medical Action, and other groups.

- Sat 24 Nov 2018. Malawi: Government puts measures to minimize chances of Ebola outbreak in the country
[AllAfrica Malawi News Agency report, edited] https://allafrica.com/stories/201811240315.html
[Byline: Andrew Ndhlovu and Jackson Soko]

The government says it has put in place appropriate measures to reduce the chances of Ebola virus spreading into the country. Minister of Health and Population, Atupele Muluzi, was speaking in Parliament on [Fri 23 Nov 2018] in his response to a supplementary question that was posed by Dowa North Member of Parliament, Enos Chitatanga who wanted to find out how prepared government is to block Ebola in the country.

"The Ministry of Health is on alert and we are monitoring closely together with the World Health Organization (WHO) any development of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

"Our soldiers from Malawi Defence Force who are deployed in DRC are being screened when they are leaving and even when coming back to check if they have contracted the virus," Muluzi said.

He further said government, through his ministry, has set up infection- inspection centres throughout the country to ensure that people entering this country are screened of the disease.

"We have deployed Ebola monitoring equipment at all the international airports and all the border posts so that they can be screening all people who are leaving and entering this country.

"We have monitoring centres in Lilongwe, Blantyre, Karonga, and Nsanje with the help from World Bank. The ministry is also monitoring all refugees' camps under United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) to make sure that we do not have the outbreak here," Muluzi said.
