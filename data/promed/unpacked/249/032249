Sewage water is causing an outbreak of amoebiasis
-------------------------------------------------
A total of 3 children living in El Trigo community in Los Teques
(Capital city of Miranda State in Venezuela) have been affected by
sewage water.

This was reported by specialists working in Francisco de Miranda
outpatient clinic located in Bolivar Avenue in Los Teques. They
pointed out that these patients' admissions occurred since 3 Nov
2011.

Since affected persons are children, health care representatives
pointed out that affected persons live near a body of sewage water, so
they did not rule out this as the main cause for the occurrence. "Foul
smelling [water] is intolerable, and this situation has been carrying
on for more than one year and no officer considered this case as
serious," commented the mother of one of the affected children.

If (health care) authorities do not take any action, it is possible
that an outbreak will occur and then the situation may become much
more complicated, [but for] now we have (only) 3 infected children.
Tomorrow, the case number may be quite higher, the mother added.

[The posting contains no information on why the authorities think this
outbreak is caused by amoeba and not other enteric pathogens like
salmonella and Shigella. When drinking water is contaminated with
sewage bacterial pathogens will be more likely than protozoan
parasites.
