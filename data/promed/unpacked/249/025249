Another patient was admitted to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) on Thursday [1 Sep 2016] in Karachi [Sindh province] over Congo fever fears. According to deputy director JPMC, the 15 year old resident of Karachi's Lasbella reached the hospital today. "The patient was rushed to an isolation ward after headache, fever and bleeding from his nose," added Dr Jamali. So far 6 people have died from Congo fever in the port city.

Director of Health Karachi Dr Shakor Abbasi said that as Eid-Ul-Azha was approaching, the chances were increasing of people getting infected with the disease.

Health experts urged that anybody [who] has symptoms such as headache, vomiting, red eyes, severe pain in body and bleeding should rush to a nearby hospital as early diagnosis of the disease could save a life. Congo is a virus which [is transmitted by ticks] on animals' skin.

Mostly animals that have heavy hairs on their skin would have more chances of carrying ticks. Health experts urged that people should go to the cattle market in the morning, wear light colours and cover their face and hands.

According to BVH focal person Dr Aamir Bokhari, the National Institute of Health, Islamabad has declared tests of 10 people including 3 professors and the wife of the late Dr SS and taxi driver B negative.

Two persons, one of them an employee of the BVH operating theatre, have been discharged from the isolation room. The focal person also claimed that Dr AK, who was detected [as] a Congo virus patient, is being treated at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi.

He said he had contacted Dr AK, who is showing signs of recovery.

[The physician from this hospital died on 30 Jul 2016, over a month ago. The incubation period is generally not more than 13 days post exposure (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/) and it seems there was no call to test contacts after such a long period. There are no sub-clinical forms of CCHF, so testing should be done only when there are symptoms with history of exposure. - Mod.UBA]

[3] Precautions urged while handling sacrificial animals

"People should be cautious about Congo virus even if their animals appear to be healthy. Using a spray or removing ticks from an infected animal might not be enough," Bahalwalpur Rescue 1122 district emergency officer Asif Channar said on Thursday [1 Sep 2016].

Speaking to The Express Tribune via phone, he advised people to use protective equipment such as gloves and masks while handling sacrificial animals.

He said people could get infected with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus on being bitten by infected ticks or squashing these. He said a human could be infected if blood or a tissue from an infected animal came into contact with his cuts, grazed on the skin, or was splashed onto his eyes, nose or mouth.

Channar said most people were not aware of the hazard of being bitten by ticks. Ticks have been found in scalp and between toes of Congo fever patients.

Dr AK, a Congo fever patient at Karachi's Aga Khan Hospital, said laboratory tests had earlier diagnosed dengue fever only. "I came to Aga Khan Hospital where they immediately took me to an isolation ward," he said. "It is unfortunate that some labs are not following standard procedures ... these are unable to diagnose Congo fever virus," he said.

Medical reports of AK, acquired by The Express Tribune, confirmed that he had earlier been diagnosed with dengue fever. He said the government had been unable to locate the virus's origin. "Millions of sacrificial animals have already been brought to cities," he said.

The virus is transmitted mainly by hyalomma ticks, which have distinctive brown and white bands on their legs. These are known in South Africa as bont-legged ticks (Afrikaans: bontpootbosluise). The virus can remain in the ticks for long periods, and even pass through the eggs to infect the next generation of ticks.

Cattle and ostriches bitten by infected ticks do not develop disease, but virus can circulate in their blood for up to a week, after which they become immune to further infection. Non-infected ticks become infected if they feed on animals during this period.

Occupational groups such as herders, farmers, abattoir workers, veterinarians, animal health workers, hunters and persons informally slaughtering domestic or wild animals are at higher risk of infection. They often have exposure to ticks on the animals and in the animal environment, and also often have exposure to animal blood, tissues (for example, during castration of calves, vaccination, notching or tagging of ears and slaughtering, etc).

Healthcare workers attending to people suffering from Congo fever are also at risk of infection from needle-stick and splash exposures. There have been several instances of secondary spread of infection from patients to healthcare workers in Pakistan. This can occur through contact of broken skin, mucous membranes with blood or blood-tinged body fluids and wastes of a Congo fever patient, or via needlestick injuries.

University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences [UVAS] vice chancellor Talat Pasha said the Livestock Department, which oversees the UVAS, was doing its best to prevent a Congo virus epidemic ahead of Eid ul Azha. He said camps had been set up at city entrances and animal markets to vaccinate sacrificial animals against the virus. "People should not panic. They should wear mask and gloves while slaughtering animals," he said.

Communicable diseases director Asim Altaf said the government had set up isolation wards at all public hospitals.
