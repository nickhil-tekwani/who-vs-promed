The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) reports the death of a man in his 20s from Rio Arriba County of septicemic plague, the 1st human plague death in New Mexico in 2020, and the 2nd human plague case overall. The Rio Arriba County man died after being hospitalized. An environmental investigation will take place at the person's home to look for ongoing risk to immediate family members, neighbors, and others in the surrounding community.

Plague is a bacterial disease of rodents and is generally transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas but can also be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals, including rodents, wildlife, and pets. Pets that are allowed to roam and hunt can bring infected fleas from dead rodents back into the home, putting household members at risk.

"Plague activity in New Mexico is usually highest during the summer months, so it is especially important now to take precautions to avoid rodents and their fleas, which can expose you to plague," said Department of Health Secretary Kathy Kunkel.

To prevent plague, the Department of Health recommends the following:
- Avoid sick or dead rodents and rabbits, and their nests and burrows.
- Prevent pets from roaming and hunting.
- Talk to your veterinarian about using an appropriate flea control product on your pets, as not all products are safe for cats, dogs, or your children.
- Clean up areas near the home where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk, and abandoned vehicles.
- Have sick pets examined promptly by a veterinarian.
- See your doctor about any unexplained illness involving a sudden and severe fever.
- Put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home.
- Don't leave your pet's food and water where rodents and wildlife can get to it.

Symptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. In most cases there is a painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit, or neck areas. Plague symptoms in cats and dogs are fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite. There may be a swelling in the lymph node under the jaw. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the fatality rate in people and pets can be greatly reduced. Physicians who suspect plague should promptly report to the New Mexico Department of Health.

This is the 1st human plague-related death in New Mexico since 2015. There was a single human plague case in 2019 in a 72-year-old man from Torrance County, and no human plague cases in 2018.

There have been 2 animal plague cases in New Mexico in 2020: 1 dog and 1 cat, both Santa Fe County. There were 2 animal plague cases in 2019 (a dog from Quay County and a cat from Santa Fe County) and 3 animal plague cases in 2018 (2 dogs from Santa Fe County and 1 dog from Torrance County).

[The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being infected.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream (septicemic plague). As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. About 14% (one in 7) of all plague cases in the United States are fatal (https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Departments-and-Agencies/DPH/dph/communications/CERC/PlagueFSwebpdf.pdf).

In recent decades, an average of 7 human plague cases have been reported each year in the United States (range: 1-17 cases per year) (https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/index.html). Most cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infections in the USA occur in the area of the "Four Corners" states -- Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah -- although California and, to a lesser extent, Oregon also may have cases. - Mod.LL
