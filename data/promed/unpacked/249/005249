Seven New Cases of Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever in Uganda
-----------------------------------------------------
KAMPALA: Despite attempts to contain an outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever
in Uganda, officials on Thu 30 Nov 2000 said that 6 new cases have been
confirmed in the third area struck by Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and a
seventh in the northern town where it was first identified in mid-October.
Health Services General Director, Francis Omaswa, said in a statement that
368 cases of Ebola virus infection have now been identified since 14 Oct
2000, and 3 deaths in the past 48 hours have raised the death toll to 152.
"In Masindi district, there are 6 new confirmed cases with no deaths,
bringing the cumulative total (in the area) to 14 cases with 5 deaths,"
Omaswa said. "Health education and active case searches have been
intensified in the district." In early November, a woman who was diagnosed
in the northern town of Gulu with Ebola fever fled to her home village in
Masindi district 125km to the south. Her husband, daughter and another
relative were all infected, and all 4 later died. The others in the area
who have been infected are all believed to have had contact with the woman
or attended her funeral. Traditional funerals in many parts of Uganda
involve washing the body of the deceased. Mourners later dip their hands in
the water as a symbol of solidarity. The government has been advising
people in affected areas to avoid cultural activities, including lingering
at burial sites, to reduce chances of contracting the virus. Omaswa said
that 12 Ebola sufferers remain in Masindi District Hospital.
