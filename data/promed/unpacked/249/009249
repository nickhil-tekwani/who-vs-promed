In an earlier ProMED-mail post, direct contact information was missing for
further information and I have received several inquiries, so I am adding
that information and a very brief introductory note on the source, which may
be of future interest. This looks like an interesting site.
The US Geological Survey National Wildlife Health Center
is (text-based) at: http://www.emtc.nbs.gov/nwhctext.html
"The National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC) is a Science Center of the
Biological Resources Division of the United States Geological Survey
located in Madison, Wisconsin. The NWHC was established in 1975 as a
biomedical laboratory dedicated to assessing the impact of disease on
wildlife and to identifying the role of various pathogens in contributing
to wildlife losses. "
The contact for the Avian Salmonellosis is:
Miller, Kim - kim_miller@usgs.gov - (608) 270-2448 -- Wildlife Disease
Specialist
Information about the parent US National Biological Resources Division (BRD)
can be obtained at: http://www.nbs.gov/ including links into the National
Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) at:
http://www.nbii.gov/index.html. The NBII provides information on and access
to biological databases, information products, directories, and guides
maintained by US Federal, State, and local government agencies, and private
organizations.
