NEWS RELEASE - Texas Animal Health Commission
For Immediate Release--New Regulation Intended to Protect Horses
Horse enthusiasts with limited area on which to keep their animals
can now be assured nearby horses have tested negative for Equine
Infectious Anemia (EIA). EIA, also referred to as "Coggins" or "Swamp
Fever," is an incurable disease that can be carried by biting flies
from infected equids (horses, mules, donkeys or asses) to "clean"
animals. While most infected animals appear healthy, some may die
from the virus. Other equids will develop chronic recurring health
problems, such as debilitating weight loss, fever, depression,
weakness, and swelling of the legs. There is no cure or approved
vaccine for EIA, and treatment is limited to providing comfort to the
sick animal.
To combat the spread of EIA, the Texas Animal Health Commission
(TAHC), the state's livestock health regulatory authority, in
response to citizen petitions, has enacted a new regulation requiring
equids to have had a negative blood test for EIA within the previous
12 months if the animals are boarded, stabled or pastured within 200
yards of equids owned by another person.
Dr. Logan said the TAHC has worked to control EIA for many years and
Texas has had a dramatic decline in the viral infection since 1997,
when more than 730 equids tested positive in Texas. Of the 250 000
equids tested in Texas in 2001, only 124 were infected, a drop which
Dr. Logan credits to owner concern, more stringent testing
requirements and a growing awareness of EIA.
Current TAHC regulations require equids to be test-negative for EIA
within the previous 12 months, if they are hauled to assemblies, such
as fairs, shows, exhibitions, rodeos, or trail rides. The 12-month
EIA test rule also applies to equidae undergoing a change of
ownership or entering the state. EIA-positive equine are permanently
identified with a "74A" on their left shoulder and must either be
euthanized, sold to slaughter, provided to an approved research
facility, or remain quarantined for life, at least 200 yards from
other equidae.
