Two pregnant women are hospitalized with cholera in the Juan Pablo Pina Hospital in San Cristobal, where 49 patients have been treated for the disease over the past few days. This cholera outbreak has forced the health authorities to use the hospital chapel to accommodate patients.

One woman, 21, who is 38 weeks pregnant, was admitted on Sunday, 25 Aug 2013, in a state of critical dehydration, but was stable by the next day. The other woman, 25, is 2 months pregnant and is also in a stable condition. According to the health authorities, the outbreak was caused by a serious contamination that affected the neighborhoods of Los Molinas, Las Flores, Puerto Rico, Barrio Nuevo, and 5 de Abril, as there is a lot of waste in the Yubazo River.

The director of the Juan Pablo Pina Hospital, Miguel Geraldino, blamed the outbreak on drinking water sold from tankers, which according to him becomes contaminated when it is poorly handled by the distributors.

He said that since Sunday, 18 Aug 2013, 25 men and 24 women have been admitted with cholera symptoms, but that so far no deaths have been registered. Geraldino said that the ages of the patients range from less than 1 year to over 65. He added that on 26 Aug 2013, 3 more patients arrived and that 5 are hospitalized.
