Bluetongue [BT], the viral disease affecting sheep, cattle, goats,
and deer and which is spread by midges, continues to advance
throughout much of northern Europe.

As of last night [25 Oct 2007], there had been 52 confirmed cases,
chiefly in East Anglia, but there are ominous signs of the disease
spreading towards the Midlands and the south-west of England.
Movement restrictions are in place and the control zone is expanding
almost on a daily basis.

But the bad news for European Union farmers is that bluetongue has
been identified in southern Scandinavia and Poland [see commentary].
Denmark is perilously close to Scotland. The most recent estimate is
that over the past few months there have been over 25 000 confirmed
cases in northern Europe.

Cattle tend to recover relatively quickly from the infection, but the
mortality rate in sheep can be 70 percent. However, cattle and sheep
that survive the initial infection tend to suffer reduced growth and
lower levels of fertility.

There are at least 24 variations of bluetongue, some of which can be
restrained by vaccination. But there is no vaccine effective against
the strain BTV-8 -- now raging across much of northern Europe. That
must be addressed with the utmost urgency, according to Kim Heywood,
director of the National Beef Association (NBA).

She said: "We have no hesitation in calling on all the UK
governments, and the European Commission, to commit to immediate
vaccine development and to making sure there are enough doses on hand
to cover the entire population of vulnerable livestock before BTV-8
re-emerges next summer.

"Sadly, we understand that no moves have been made to kick-start this
process. The NBA has been advised by leading pharmaceutical companies
that up to 8 months is needed to secure a go-ahead, develop an
effective vaccine, acquire the licence, and organise distribution."

It is conceded that as many as 30 million doses would be required to
vaccinate the entire UK cattle herd with up to 15 million shots to
cover the sheep population, with further provision necessary for
booster injections. [The figures above, particularly in relation to
cattle, are excessive compared to data from other sources. According
to Defra (UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs)
data, altogether there are about 10 million cattle in the UK: a
little over 2 million adult dairy cows, a little under 2 million
adult beef cows, and about 6 million younger animals. Even if each
animal is vaccinated twice, 30 million doses seem excessive. As to
sheep, Defra says their total number in the UK is about 36 million,
half of which are adult breeding animals. - Mod. AS]

The probability is that the EU's entire herd of 85 million cattle and
the flock of 90 million sheep will have to be vaccinated to forestall
the potential decimation of a sizeable proportion of the livestock
industry. The UK, bad as the current situation may be, could well be
in line for far greater problems next year [2008].

The evidence from France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and
Luxembourg suggests that bluetongue becomes decidedly more virulent
in the 2nd year after the initial outbreaks.

The worst-case scenario, unless there is a very severe winter to kill
off the midges, is that huge parts of the UK and mainland Europe will
be subject to stringent movement restrictions next summer and autumn
[2008] -- and there will be no compensation for farmers.

information is in need of confirmation. According to the 25 Oct 2007
update of EC map showing the restriction zones, the countries which

Should the whole of England be turned into a single bluetongue zone?
That was the question dividing the livestock industry following last
week's confirmation of the disease in Peterborough, which led to a
dramatic extension of the Bluetongue Protection Zone.

From inside the Control Zone
----------------------------
One of the country's best-known sheep farmers, became the 1st farmer
in Sussex to be confirmed with the disease last week. He believes the
virus may have been in his sheep since August [2007].

Until last week, the farmer, who farms 12 000 sheep near Rye and is
chairman of the British Wool Marketing Board, had been in the
Protection Zone (PZ). He is now in a Control Zone (CZ). He has been
calling from the start of the outbreak for the country to be turned
into a single CZ.

"Extending the CZ to the whole of the country would keep me in
business. If it is not extended, we are all finished in the CZ," he
said. "I can hardly sell any lamb and I'm taking a pittance for
anything I can sell, about BP 20 [USD 40.1] for good lambs, because
of the foot-and-mouth restrictions in place as well.

"Most of my winter grazing is in Somerset, Dorset, and Wiltshire but
I can't get to that now I am in the CZ. I have got nothing on tack. I
have got thousands of sheep I can't move that are just getting
thinner and thinner and any minute now I'll have to start killing them.

"There is no logic in trying to hold the line. It is obvious now that
cases are multiplying and Defra is not putting any resources into it.

"I have spoken to people in Holland and Belgium about it. They all
said it's just a waste of time trying to control it. You just accept
you have got it and if we are confident we are going to have a
vaccine by next summer, we can live with it until then.

"The disease is not going to kill animals but the restrictions are
going to kill thousands unless we move to one CZ."

From inside the Protection Zone
-------------------------------
Drayton Livestock Market found itself inside the PZ after it was
extended last Wednesday.

The market's Rob Lea said: "We are trading as normal, but numbers are
affected as some people can't bring their livestock here. If someone
from outside the zone comes here and is not happy with the price they
get, then they can't take their animals back, they have to stay here.

"Now the area covered by the zone has spread so wide, the further it
goes, the better really. If everyone was in the area we could all
trade as before and we could get back to normal."

From outside the Protection Zone
--------------------------------
Another farmer runs an arable and beef farm at Buckland Newton, near
Dorchester, about 60 miles [96.5 km] away from the bluetongue line.
He is deputy chairman of Dorset NFU [National Farmers' Union].

"At the moment I believe we should maintain the status quo, although
it is probably not possible in the long-term.

"It is difficult for the guys on the other side of the line because
exports are stopped and they cannot trade outside the zone but I
think, on balance, we should retain the status quo as long as
possible although it is probably not possible in the long-term."

Robert Robinson, a former chairman of the National Beef Association,
has a beef finishing unit in Northumberland, selling fat cattle to
abattoirs in Scotland.

"I think making the whole country a bluetongue zone would be a good
thing really, although we don't want to do anything to encourage its
spread. The disease is here and we will just have to live with it," he said.

"Providing I can still sell fat cattle to abattoirs over the border,
it will not affect my business too much.

"At the moment Scotland don't license abattoirs to take cattle out of
the Protection Zone. If they allowed that, having an all-England zone
wouldn't have too great an effect. I suspect they would have to
because they need English beef. Otherwise the controls could do more
damage than the disease."

Wright Manley is located half a mile [0.8 km] outside the PZ.
Auctioneer Clive Norbury said: "We are being severely affected. Three
quarters of our trade comes from inside the zone and those people
can't bring anything here.

"It's devastating, we have had to cancel 2 sales this week already.
Extending the zones to the whole country is the only answer -- and I
mean the only answer. There is no other way we can get trading back
to normal. It's a total nightmare."

The Scottish view
-----------------
NFU Scotland deputy president Nigel Miller said: "Scotland has no
intention of becoming part of a UK-wide Bluetongue Control Zone,
unless the disease situation changes significantly next year [2008].
Extending the zone to incorporate Scotland goes much further than is
required by the EU and would serve no purpose under the current
disease situation.

"Extending the zone to cover all of England is, of course, an English
issue but we have concerns about it. We believe it would increase the
risk of disease spread, if, for example, virus-carrying cattle were
transported from an infected area to the north of England, and the
disease got into the local midge population. This, in turn, could
make it more likely that disease gets into Scotland.

"There is a lot of trade both ways between the north of England and
Scotland that is beneficial for both sides, especially in pedigree
cattle. Many Scottish farmers go to the big Carlisle sale and many
from England go to Perth.

"It would be very damaging if that trade was stopped for both
Scottish and English farmers."

The Welsh view
--------------
Malcolm Thomas, director NFU Cymru, said: "The position of NFU Wales
is absolutely clear. At the moment we would not wish to extend the
zone to the whole of Wales on 2 counts.

"We would not wish to put ourselves under restriction unless it was
absolutely necessary. Secondly, the view of the veterinary experts in
Defra is that the zones should not be extended because to do so runs
the risk of spreading the disease further.

"But the whole thing is under review, it depends on how the disease
moves. Having the zone come up to the Welsh border is an unwelcome
restriction that none of us want but it's the price you pay for
maintaining Wales' bluetongue-free status."

Farmers in Dorset are being made subject to new government control
zones that restrict animal movements. Defra has extended the
Bluetongue Control Zone from Kent and East Sussex into East Dorset.

The rules follow a new case of the disease in Sevenoaks, and means
farmers of cattle, sheep, goats, and deer may not move them outside
the designated zone apart from to slaughter.

Vehicles used to transport animals to slaughterhouses must also be
sprayed with approved insecticidal spray prior to loading. The
movement controls do not apply to pigs.

Defra has written to all recorded owners of animals within the
affected districts advising them of this change and urging vigilance.

[Obviously, the ADNS information from some of the affected countries
is not updated.

A map of the Dutch BT situation, as updated 22 Oct 2007, is available at

The map shows, in coloured dots, the bovine (violet) and sheep (red)
outbreaks, as well as the locations where vectors-traps are operated
(blue flags).

The French Ministry of Agriculture published an update on 24 Oct
2007, according to which 7259 cases (outbreaks?) of bluetongue have
been reported in France until the said date; no breakdown into
cattle, sheep, and goats was available. These French data have been
kindly provided by Susan Baekeland (<grolleyog@wanadoo.fr>), who is
gratefully acknowledged. The disagreement between these figures and
the figures in ADNS are in need of explanation.

In Germany, 15 404 "cases" (holdings?) had been reported until 19 Oct
2007. For additional information (in German) and a map, provided by
the Federal Friedrich-Loeffler Research Institute for Animal Health

Regarding the UK: as at 17:00 pm on 26 Oct 2007, there were 54
confirmed premises affected by bluetongue. - Mod. AS]
