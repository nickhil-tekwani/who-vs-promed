The Telangana government sounded a red alert after the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus broke out in Ranga Reddy district about 20 km [12.4 mi] from Hyderabad.

In wake of the outbreak, the government swung into action and initiated a process to cull about 200 000 birds within a 10 km [6.2 mi] radius and also ban sale of poultry and eggs in Hayathnagar, the main town in the district and issued an advisory to Andhra Pradesh as well.

"We have decided to cull about 200 000 birds and we are taking all safety precautions as per the laid down protocol. Gunny sacks are being procured and pits are being dug," said Dr K Vamsi Krishna Reddy, assistant veterinary surgeon.

The government also set up rapid response teams to help in the culling process.

About a week ago, several birds mysteriously died in a poultry farm in Thorur village in Hayathnagar [Ranga Reddy district], following which dead chicken samples were sent to a testing laboratory in Bhopal.

The local veterinary doctor raised an alarm after he found hundreds of birds dead in the farm.

"Yes we confirm it as the deadly H5N1 virus and we have advised the animal husbandry department in Telangana and the government to take all appropriate measures," DD Kulkarni, joint director, High-Security Animal Disease Laboratory, Bhopal, told TOI from Bhopal.

An advisory to the central government and authorities in Andhra Pradesh, were sent to report any incident of dead poultry, officials said, as fears of the virus, spreading rose.

Since 2003, there have been 209 human deaths globally from the H5N1 strain and 340 confirmed cases of infection.

"All safety measures must be taken to contain the virus. We first detected the virus in Jalgaon, Maharashtra," Kulkarni added. Andhra Pradesh reported an outbreak in 2009.
