Health authorities have confirmed the 1st case of Zika virus [infection] in Guatemala.

In a press conference led by the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance, they confirmed that the case was a man in the western province of Zecapa. Due to this case, an epidemiological alert has been declared in the entire Guatemalan territory.

The Technical Vice Minister of Health, German Acevedo, and the head of the Epidemiology Department, Loren Gobern, stated that the case was confirmed by a test done by a laboratory where the samples were sent to the United States [presumably the CDC or the WHO reference Center at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston].

Gobern stated that the sample was taken this past 12 Nov [2015] when the patient presented with fever, head and body aches, nausea and conjunctivitis without secretion. "The sample was confirmed as positive in writing," Gobern said.

[There is no indication that the patient had traveled abroad to countries where Zika virus transmission is going on. Presumably, this is a locally acquired infection. Heightened surveillance is prudent, given that this likely is a locally acquired case.

Pablo Kuri, Subsecretary for Prevention and Health Promotion, has confirmed the 1st imported case of Zika virus [infection].

In a press conference, Kuri indicated that the affected individual is a 26-year-old man from Queretaro who contracted the disease in Colombia. "It began with fever, body aches, headache, but no rash; most important is that he was in Santa Marta, Colombia 2 weeks before onset of illness," he said.

[This is a good example of how infected individuals move viruses internationally. Santa Marta, on the Caribbean coast of Colombia, is a major tourist destination. As cases of Zika virus infection continue to mount in Colombia and Brazil, more of these imported cases can be expected. If viremic travelers end up in an area where the mosquito vector _Aedes aegypti_ is abundant, local virus transmission can occur.

Zika virus continues to spread in Colombia and Brazil. There are no epidemiological or ecological barriers to prevent its dissemination to countries in the Americas where _Aedes aegypti_ vector mosquitoes are abundant, and dengue as well as chikungunya viruses are being transmitted.
