Initial Laboratory Tests Fail to Confirm Rabies Virus Infection
---------------------------------------------------------------
Initial tests carried out on a Scottish man who is critically ill in
hospital with suspected rabies [Europoean lyssavirus] have proved negative.
Tests have been carried out on a 56-year-old patient who was bitten by a
bat. Doctors said the animal lover and artist, from Guthrie, in Angus, has
been showing symptoms of a rabies virus [European Bat Lyssavirus), which
can be carried by bats.

NHS Tayside said primary tests results from a government laboratory showed
no trace of [rabies virus]infection, but the patient's symptoms continue to
indicate rabies. However, officials stressed that many more tests have been
carried out, and further results will be forthcoming over the next week.

Drew Walker, NHS Tayside Director of Public Health, said: "It is important
to stress again that this is not a confirmed case of rabies and that lab
test results to date have proved negative. The patient's clinical symptoms
and all available circumstantial evidence however continue to point to the
possibility of rabies. By themselves, these interim lab results reduce the
probability of rabies. However, it is recognised that negative lab test
results do not allow us to rule out rabies, and so we cannot change our
working diagnosis." Mr Walker said doctors would await further tests but
until then "it continues to be prudent and sensible" to treat the case as
rabies and carry on with public health measures in place.

Doctors announced on Tuesday that the patient, a well-known bat lover and
artist, was being treated at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee. The patient has
been a bat worker for many years and was known to have been bitten on at
least one occasion. However, both health officials and conservation experts
have stressed that the chances of rabies infection are extremely rare and
said there is no risk to the general public. They stressed that only people
who work with bats are at any risk and they have vaccination procedures in
place.

[Dr. Henry Wilde raised the question as to whether this individual had
undergone pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis with rabies vaccine. According
to various newswire reports the patient did not have a history of either
pre- or post exposure rabies vaccination. At present we do not have
additional information other than what has been available on the newswires.
