There has been a considerable health problem in south Gujarat in India due
to fatal leptospirosis since this monsoon season (rains begin in July every
year). Cases are being reported from Surat, Nosari and Valsad districts.
The Gandhinagar office of WHO informs us that severe illness with hepatic
and renal involvements leading to death are the major sequelae.

[As can be seen from the postings below, leptospirosis has been a
significant problem in this area of India for some time. A water-borne
disease in most circumstances, cases of this spirochetal infection
invariably increase with the onset of the monsoon season.
The method of diagnosis in the reported cases is not stated. - Mod.LL]
