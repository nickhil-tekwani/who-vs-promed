Viet Nam considers vaccinating chickens
---------------------------------------
Hit with a new wave of bird flu outbreaks, Viet Nam is considering
vaccinating its poultry at domestic breeding farms, officials said on Tue
20 Jul 2004.
Bui Quang Anh, head of the Veterinary Department under the Ministry of
Agriculture, said a conference of scientists and poultry farmers convened
in Hanoi, Tue 20 Jul 2004, to discuss a possible vaccination program.
However, no decision has been made yet, he said.
Anh said the results of a pilot vaccination program at 2 poultry farms in
the north and south, in 2004, during the initial bird flu outbreak, were
not promising. Viet Nam had used a Dutch-made vaccine called Intervet, in
February 2004, during the peak of the outbreak.
Anh said he wanted to exercise caution, since the World Animal Health
Organization has warned that vaccination is not the only way to fight a
bird flu outbreak.
"The issue is effectiveness, and, the selection of vaccines. Viet Nam has 2
problems: veterinary ability and un-concentrated poultry farming, which
makes it difficult to eliminate outbreaks when [they occur]," he said.
The department will compile ideas and suggestions for the Agriculture
Ministry, which will have the final say on the issue.
In the most recent wave of bird flu, Viet Nam has culled nearly 50 000
birds, as small outbreaks cropped up in 9 central and southern provinces.
The country declared itself bird-flu-free at the end of March 2004, despite
the warning of health organizations that the virus remained in the environment.
Bird flu has also re-emerged in China and Thailand over the past month
[July 2004]. Earlier in 2004, the H5N1 strain of avian flu swept through
Asia, ravaging poultry farms in the region.
Viet Nam killed, or forced the cull of, more than 43 million poultry to
prevent the spread of bird flu outbreaks. The virus also jumped to humans,
killing 16 people here and another 8 in Thailand.

Viet Nam kills bird flu-suspected chickens
---------------------------------------
Viet Nam culled more than 6000 chickens showing symptoms of bird flu in the
country's southern Long An province on 19-20 Jul 2004.
It is the 1st case of culling poultry in the province since Viet Nam
declared itself free of bird flu in late March 2004, according to local
newspaper, Labor, on Wed 21 Jul 2004.
The slaughtering took place after many of the chickens, raised by a local
farmer in Long An's Tan An town, died in mass numbers, which caused him
losses of 200 million Vietnamese dong (VND) [USD 13 000].
The local veterinary bureau is probing into the cause of the deaths. As of
19 Jul 2004, bird flu recurred in 8 southern localities, which either
killed, or led to the forced slaughter of, 35 326 fowl, mainly chickens and
quails. All the new outbreaks have been detected in small-scale farms that
have not taken full preventive measures.
Bird flu has killed 17 percent of Viet Nam's poultry population, and
claimed 16 human lives, since its outbreak in December 2003. A total of
43.2 million fowl nationwide either died or were culled, causing the local
poultry industry to suffer direct losses of 1.3 trillion VND [USD 82.8
million].

Indonesia reports new outbreak of bird flu
---------------------------------------
Bird flu has resurfaced in parts of Indonesia, prompting health officials
to implement a massive campaign to vaccinate chickens. The latest outbreak
follows a resurgence of bird flu in China, Thailand, and Viet Nam in recent
weeks. Indonesian agricultural ministry officials said, on Wed 21 Jul 2004,
that the government plans to distribute as many as 300 million doses of
vaccine to poultry farmers in a bid to halt a fresh outbreak of bird flu.
Indonesia is the latest country to report an outbreak of the H5N1 strain of
avian flu that has hit Southeast Asia. Thailand, Viet Nam, and southern
China also have reported recent outbreaks.
Earlier in 2004, the virus swept through much of Asia, forcing governments
to cull millions of birds. More than 20 people died after contracting the
virus from sick birds.
The World Health Organization says it remains concerned that the H5N1 virus
could change to become easier for humans to contract. The agency is calling
on governments to ensure that people involved in culling birds are well
protected from the virus.
Thai Health Ministry spokeswoman Nitaya Mahaphol says her government is
better prepared for this outbreak than it was for the 1st one.
Mrs. Nitaya also notes that the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome in 2003 helped prepare medical officials to deal with new health
threats. "We have been very well prepared because of the experiences with
SARS, and avian flu, at the very beginning of the year," she said. "We have
been training our health officials in order to deal with surveillance and
prevention."
During the previous bird flu outbreak, 8 people died in Thailand, and 16
perished in Viet Nam.
So far, the latest outbreak has caused no human cases, although health
officials remain on alert.
The 1st avian flu outbreak disrupted the region's poultry industry.
Thousands of farmers lost their flocks, and many countries around the world
banned imports of poultry from infected countries.

Bird flu resurfaces in parts of Indonesia, prompting vaccination drive
-----------------------------------------------
Avian flu has resurfaced in parts of Indonesia, prompting officials to
launch a massive campaign to vaccinate chickens, the government announced
on Wed 21 Jul 2004.
Dr. Tri Satya Putri Naipospos, director of animal health for the Ministry
of Agriculture, said the government planned to distribute as many as 300
million doses of vaccine to poultry farms, after reports that a few
thousand chickens had died in the eastern part of Java island in July 2004.
"We can say there have been new cases in several districts in East Java,"
Naipospos said. "By vaccinating the chickens, we can reduce the mortality
rates and reduce the spread of the virus."
Indonesia joins Viet Nam, China, and Thailand, which have also seen a
resurgence of bird flu in the past month [July 2004].
Earlier in 2004, the deadly H5N1 strain of avian flu swept through Asia,
ravaging the poultry industry and killing 24 people in Thailand and Viet
Nam. More than 100 million chickens and ducks across the region were
slaughtered, including upwards of 10 million in Indonesia.
During the outbreak in February 2004, Jakarta came under heavy criticism
for failing to alert the public to the threat, and, for being slow to
respond with a mass slaughter and other measures aimed at containing it.
In Canada, some 17 million birds were slaughtered, after the disease hit
the B.C. Fraser Valley poultry industry in February 2004.
