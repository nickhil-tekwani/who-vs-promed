It is true there were 1,582 cases reported for NSW in 1997 (calendar year)
and 1,076 for 1996 - a substantial increase over the 242 reported in 1995 -
and the virus did 'reach' the outskirts of Sydney for the first time in any
substantial respect. However, the great majority of these cases in both
1996 and 1997 occurred in the months January through May, the usual
'transmission season' in NSW.
With respect to the current 'transmission season' for 1998, it is of course
too early for January reports, but there is no indication of any
exceptional activity in the late spring months; there were only 12 reports
for November 1997 and 10 for December 1997, compared with the 1996 figures
of 32 and 32 for the same months. Suffice to say, there is no sign of any
'alarming' activity in NSW this current season, at least not at this time.

I think that Dr McAnulty's comments [980109223432 have been taken out of
context. Certainly there were 1,585 cases of RRV infection reported to the
NSW Dept of Health last year and that this was an increase in numbers on
the previous year. However, I believe that Dr. McAnulty was issuing a
warning that, as the summer season gets underway, people should be more
aware of the potential for infection with RRV (and other arboviruses) and
take appropriate precautions. As yet there is no evidence to suggest any
increase in case numbers -there is certainly no epidemic.
It must be remembered that cases reported to the Health Department are
based on serological tests, often single IgM positives. It is well known
that IgM persists for long periods of time in RRV infection and that
therefore some of these reports may represent old infections.

[Thanks to both Richard and Linda for their responses. This situation is
both interesting and instructive. When the IgM capture antibody assay
became widely available in Australia and elsewhere, some wanted to use that
assay to determine recent infections, even with single serum samples;
cooler heads prevailed. As Linda points out, IgM antibody resulting from
RRV infection may persist for many months, even years; this is true for
other virus infections as well. A paper by John Mackenzie and 14 others,
published in Australian _Communicable Diseases Intelligence_ (17:202-206,
1993), suggested that paired acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples
are required in order to make a "confirmed" diagnosis, that tests of single
serum samples can, at best, be used to make "presumptive" diagnoses. If,
as Linda relates, "cases reported to the Health Department are based on
serological tests, often single IgM positives", then there is a likelihood
that many of the "cases" of RRV infection are "presumptive" and not
"confirmed", representing only remote infections with RRV associated with
recent illnesses clinically similar to that caused by RRV. Adding
"presumptive" to "confirmed" leads to an overstatement of the
epidemiological situation.
A "case" ought to be associated with an illness as well as with a
significant rise or fall in antibody titer, and is not simply a person with
antibody to a virus; this is true for essentially all viruses. Most of us
have antibody to measles, polioviruses, mumps, etc. but we are not now ill
with those viruses.
Unless and until RRV and other virus infections are accepted as "confirmed"
only after appropriate tests of paired serum samples are done and antibody
detected in patients, the epidemiological situation will remain murky and
will continue to provide a spoon with which the media can stir the pot. -
