[A] Mask mandates
"New York City's #COVID numbers continue to go down," Mayor Eric Adams tweeted. "So long as our indicators show a low level of risk and we see no surprises this week, on [Mon 7 Mar 2022] we will also remove the vaccination requirements for Key2NYC--meaning indoor dining, fitness and entertainment venues."

Over the weekend New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that statewide mask mandate for school would expire mid-week, and masking decisions would be left to local school officials.

The mask mandate for indoor public places in Illinois ends today, the Chicago Tribune reports. Masks will still be mandatory on public transportation. [https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-covid-masks-illinois-pritzker-politics-20220227-lpohndqoq5clnlscl3qy2q4rkq-story.html]

The announcements in 2 of the nation's biggest cities come in the wake of changing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance released late last week. The new recommendations suggest that most of the country could drop indoor mask requirements and say that hospitalization levels and hospital capacity should be the new metrics by which to measure future mandates. [https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/02/cdc-eases-covid-19-mask-guidance-adds-metrics-future-use].

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) said in a press release that it supports the CDC's updates to its COVID-19 community guidance. [https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2022/idsa-support-for-cdcs-change-to-covid-19-guidance/]

"The change in guidance reflects the high level of protection that vaccines offer against serious disease and death while recognizing that protections may remain in place in settings where spread is more likely such as health care or large congregate settings," IDSA said.

All states but Hawaii have now removed indoor mask requirements due to dropping case counts.

[B] Poor vaccine protection in kids 5 to 11

New data published on the preprint server medRxiv today suggest that COVID mRNA vaccination for kids ages 5 to 11 does little to prevent new cases. [Dorabawila V, Hoefer D, Bauer U, Bassett M, Lutterloh E and Rosenberg E. Effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine among children 5--11 and 12--17 years in New York after the Emergence of the Omicron Variant. medRxiv 2022.02.25.22271454; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.25.22271454]

The research, conducted during the Omicron surge, is based on New York State Department of Health data and shows that protection against infection for 5 to 11 year olds dropped from 68% to 12% within 1 month of full vaccination.

Children ages 12 and older get a larger dose of vaccine, and seem to be more protected, the authors said. The study has not yet been peer reviewed.

"The finding of markedly-lower VE [vaccine effectiveness] against infection for children 11 years compared to those 12 and 13 years, despite overlapping physiology, suggests lower vaccine dose may explain lower 5--11 years VE," the authors wrote.

----
[C] USA cases drop 37%

The 7-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is 65 721, with 1897 daily deaths, according to the Washington Post tracker. In the past week, new daily cases fell 37%, deaths fell 14%, and hospitalizations fell 17%. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=hp_pandemic_gfx/&state=US]

The United States reported 7464 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [Sun 27 Feb 2022] and 182 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. In total the country has recorded 78 981 614 COVID-19 cases, including 949 440 deaths. [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases]

The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows 64.9% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 76.3% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 43.6% of fully vaccinated Americans have received a booster dose. [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total]

----
[D] Hong Kong crisis deepens


In global COVID-19 news, meanwhile, Hong Kong's omicron surge continues to intensify, with officials reporting 34 446 new cases today [Mon 28 Feb 2022], up sharply from last week when daily cases topped 10 000 for the first time.

Hospitals are stretched, with media reports showing patients in hospital beds waiting outdoors for space in a room.

Meanwhile, deaths are also starting to rise, and mortuaries are having a hard time keeping up with the pace, according to Reuters, which said Hong Kong reported 83 more deaths yesterday. [https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/hong-kong-facilities-storing-dead-bodies-stretched-covid-deaths-climb-2022-02-28/]

Officials said many of the deaths were in unvaccinated people, including older people who were hesitant about side effects or were complacent owing to the city's earlier success handing the virus.

[E] More SARS-CoV-2 origin clues

In other COVID-19 developments, 3 new preprint studies, including one from the China Center for Disease Control (China CDC), published over the last few days added new clues that suggest the Wuhan market that was at the center of the early outbreak was the source of the virus. [Gao G, Liu W, Liu P, et al. Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment and animal samples of the Huanan Seafood Market. Research Square. DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-1370392/v1]

A news report from Nature, which detailed all 3 studies, none of which have been peer-reviewed, said the reports bolster earlier suspicions but don't provide a genetic smoking gun. [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00584-8#ref-CR1]

Scientists who conducted the studies analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 samples collected from the market and, using geolocation, linked many to a part of the market that sold live animals. One of the studies found that the human cases clustered around the market before fanning out across Wuhan. [https://zenodo.org/record/6299600#.Yh06HJPMKng]

In another study, a research group that also included scientists from the first study looked at the 2 earliest lineages, which found enough differences between them to suggest separate introductions from animals to people. [https://zenodo.org/record/6291628#.Yh06R5PMKng]

Meanwhile, the team from China CDC described the sequenced genetic material from the positive market environmental samples, which confirm they are nearly identical to those that infected humans. The researchers also noted that the 2 lineages that circulated in the pandemic's earliest days were both present in the market.

[2] Wastewater: bacterial meta-transcriptomics
Date: Sun 27 Feb 2022

https://www.news-medical.net/news/20220227/SARS-CoV-2-monitoring-could-be-improved-with-use-of-bacterial-metatranscriptomes-in-wastewater.aspx


[Citation. Salido RA, Martino C, Karthikeyan S, et al. (2022). Bacterial metatranscriptomes in wastewater can differentiate virally infected human populations. bioRxiv. doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.23.481658]

In a recent research report from the United States, currently available on bioRxiv preprint server, scientists have shown that bacterial taxonomic and functional profiles can discriminate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) status even without directly detecting viral transcripts - opening the door for entirely novel approaches in wastewater-based epidemiology.

Wastewater-based epidemiology for tracking diseases represents a concept that is becoming more pervasive in recent years due to many advantages compared to traditional approaches, as it can provide particularly comprehensive information on different communities.

One significant advantage is that it is non-invasive and cost-effective when compared to individual clinical testing. Furthermore, it does not necessitate individual consent to clinical testing in order to report the results to public health agencies thus it can be highly beneficial to under-served populations.

Nonetheless, at the moment, the wastewater-based epidemiology scheme is limited to pathogen detection and characterization by using real-time PCR and sequencing methods, which means it cannot detect disease agents for which a screening test has not been developed.

Recent studies that have used a highly spatially resolved, high-throughput wastewater monitoring system on a college campus showed that it was possible to collect and characterize thousands of wastewater samples with real-time PCR, identifying 85% of clinical cases caused by SARS-CoV-2, and also enable genomic surveillance for emerging variants of concern by complete genome sequencing.

In this research paper, a research group led by Dr. Rodolfo A Salido and Dr. Rob Knight from the University of California San Diego in La Jolla (USA) used a metatranscriptomics approach for an untargeted community/population-level disease monitoring strategy.

Rationale behind the study
--------------------------
Akin to many other different pathogens, SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to cause systematic disruptions in the microbial communities of the human gut (also known as intestinal microbiome), which is the principal human microbial input to wastewater.

Consequently, metatranscriptomics in this context can leverage correlations in observable changes in wastewater microbiomes with human microbiome disruptions that can be linked to a certain disease state, such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) known to affect the gastrointestinal tract as well.

Here the research group performed untargeted metatranscriptomics on virally-enriched wastewater samples from 10 locations on the University of California San Diego campus, and validated the predictive power for wastewater SARS-CoV-2 status discrimination.

A proof-of-principle for wastewater-based epidemiology
------------------------------------------------------
In a nutshell, the results of this study showed that wastewater metatranscriptomes could divulge traces of rare pathogens via alterations of the microbiome of the infected individuals, which are subsequently reflected in the wastewater microbiome.

Samples obtained from each sewer hole in this study have shown a distinct microbiome signature, which likely reflects a composite of the individual microbiomes of those contributing to each wastewater stream. This in turn established a proof-of-principle for high-throughput biomarker discovery in wastewater-based epidemiology.

In any case, the untargeted nature of this data modality makes it somewhat flexible for monitoring a myriad of diseases at the population scale and is superior to metagenomic monitoring since it encompasses all living organisms and viruses.

Screening large populations
---------------------------
This type of wastewater sample monitoring at building-level resolution can screen large populations for SARS-CoV-2, prioritizing testing and isolation efforts. In addition, the methodology can be applied to different types of biospecimens and have a considerable impact beyond the field of epidemiology.

"One of the limitations of the proposed strategy is the narrow stability of the samples' RNA molecules," caution study authors in this bioRxiv preprint paper that is currently under peer-review.

"However, our methods don't claim to comprehensively characterize the wastewater metatranscriptome and instead focus on the fact that changes in the observable bacterial metatranscriptome are sufficient to discriminate the wastewater's viral status, with SARS-CoV-2 detection status serving as a relevant case study", they add.

But even though pivotal features of the bacterial metatranscriptome discriminate SARS-CoV-2 detection, additional work will be necessary to determine how broadly this phenomenon can actually be generalized to other pathogens.

[3] Coronavirus variants
Date: Sun 27 Feb 2022
Source: Los Angeles Times [edited]
https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-02-27/covid-19-virus-vaccines-evasion-t-cells


It is now well known that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can mutate to evade vaccine protection against infection. The omicron variants -- BA.1, B1.1 and BA.2 -- can infect those who were previously infected by other variants, even when vaccinated. A 3rd booster shot offers some protection from an omicron infection, but it wanes after 3 or 4 months, leaving most people susceptible to reinfection. That said, the immunity conveyed by prior infection or vaccination still dramatically reduces the incidence of hospitalization and death.

We have also come to realize that our main saviors against COVID-19 turn out not to be antibodies, but rather another part of the immune system: T cells. Studies show that the strength of our long-lived T-cell response to the virus' proteins -- especially by T cells that recognize the spike protein -- strongly correlates with the degree of protection.

There are 2 types of T cells, CD4+ and CD8+, which are distinguished by proteins on their surface. Because CD4+ T cells mostly assist in the production of antibodies, the CD8+ T cells are the real heroes of the story. Once they identify an invader they remember from a previous encounter, they act quickly to move in for the kill, demolishing infected cells and cutting short the life cycle of the virus.

Until omicron, the differences in neutralization by vaccine-induced antibodies and by monoclonal antibodies were relatively minor. But the process by which T cells recognize viral proteins is very different from that of antibodies, which recognize structures on the intact viral protein. We know that these critical structures, particularly those of the exterior spike protein, differ from variant to variant. It is precisely such structural diversity that allows the virus to evade most antibodies made in response to natural infection and vaccination.

By contrast, T cells do not recognize intact proteins. Rather, T-cell recognition occurs when a viral protein within a cell is chopped into short segments and cradled in the grip of a cellular protein called MHC type 1. MHC type 1 presents the viral fragment to the T cell at the cell surface, where the T cell can recognize the combination of the viral fragment presented by the MHC type 1 protein.

T cells recognize and react to a very broad array of viral protein fragments. For SARS-CoV-2, these fragments overlap very little with the regions of the virus that are sensitive to neutralization by antibodies. That is why T-cell responses to viral infection are generally preserved across variants.

Until omicron, vaccines that use one viral protein raised almost the same T-cell response to all variants. But now the situation has changed. Our MHC type 1 proteins are diverse, and each recognizes a unique set of viral protein fragments. Our reaction to viral proteins thus depends on their sequence and that of our own particular MHC type 1 set of proteins.

Consider a recent study by Gaurav D. Gaiha and his colleagues, examining T-cell responses to the Wuhan, delta and omicron strains in people who have been either infected, vaccinated and boosted, or infected and vaccinated but not boosted. They found that most people who are infected after vaccination have strong and durable CD4+ and CD8+ responses to all 3 variants.

But there was one worrying discovery. Approximately 20% of those vaccinated showed a decline of greater than 50% in T-cell response to omicron, compared to the Wuhan and delta variants. These poor T-cell responses were not correlated with sex or age, and follow-up experiments revealed that the difference was due to lower CD8+ reactivity, rather than to the CD4+ T-cell response.

The authors speculate that CD8+ T cells' inability to respond to omicron may be due to a lack of recognition of the mutated peptides. Indeed, their theoretical calculations are consistent with the hypothesis that changes in the amino acid sequence of the omicron spike protein underlie the observed blind spots in T-cell recognition. Inherited differences in the ability to recognize specific protein fragments likely account for some people's failure to mount anti-omicron defenses. The authors offer the conjecture that "it is possible that these individuals will have reduced protection against severe disease."

One sobering conclusion is that omicron has drifted so far from the original strain that 20% of people in the study may not be fully protected either from infection or from hospitalization and death. However, the study found that a 3rd vaccine dose increases T-cell responses by 20 times or more.

"While the omicron spike protein was able to escape T cells in a subset of individuals," Gaiha told me, "what we learned is that this deficiency in T-cell recognition can be overcome by booster vaccination. In addition, we found that non-spike proteins could be attractive targets for 2nd-generation vaccines to protect against future SARS-CoV-2 evolution."

Gaiha espouses an optimistic interpretation. But omicron is a warning that future variants may escape both antibodies and T-cell immunity. We cannot predict whether a variant will arise that evades the vaccines' ability to protect against infection and serious illness, but we must be prepared for such a threat, lest we remain unguarded against it.

Summary
The SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant (B.1.1.529) contains mutations that mediate escape from antibody responses, although the extent to which these substitutions in spike and non-spike proteins affect T cell recognition is unknown. In this study, we show that T cell responses in individuals with prior infection, vaccination, both prior infection and vaccination, and boosted vaccination are largely preserved to omicron spike and non-spike proteins. However, we also identify a subset of individuals (approx. 21%) with a >50% reduction in T cell reactivity to the omicron spike. Evaluation of functional CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cell responses confirmed these findings and revealed that reduced recognition to omicron spike is primarily observed within the CD8+ T cell compartment potentially due to escape from HLA binding. Booster vaccination enhanced T cell responses to omicron spike. In contrast to neutralizing immunity, these findings suggest preservation of T cell responses to the omicron variant, although with reduced reactivity in some individuals. - Mod.LK]

[4] Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
Date: Thu 24 Feb 2022
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious disease research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/02/study-90-young-ecmo-eligible-covid-patients-us-hospital-died-amid-rationing


Nearly 90% of adult COVID-19 patients who were eligible for --but didn't receive-- extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during the height of the pandemic died in the hospital owing to a lack of resources, even though they were young and had few underlying health issues, according to a natural experiment published late last week in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.

Reserved for youngest, sickest
------------------------------
Vanderbilt University researchers prospectively analyzed data from all COVID-19 patients referred to a single center for ECMO from [1 Jan to 31 Aug 2021]. Patients qualified for ECMO if they were younger than 60 years, had a body mass index (BMI) less than 55 kg/m2, had received mechanical ventilation for more than 7 days, or had irreversible neurologic injury, chronic lung disease, cancer, or advanced multi-organ dysfunction.

Patients also had to have no more than 3 selected contraindications, including age older than 50 years, BMI greater than 45 kg/m2, underlying illnesses, receipt of mechanical ventilation for more than 4 days, acute kidney injury, receipt of vasopressors (drugs used to treat low blood pressure), hospitalization for more than 14 days, or a period of more than 4 weeks since COVID-19 diagnosis.

A systematic assessment of the health system's resources to provide ECMO for eligible patients (ie, equipment, personnel, and intensive care unit bed availability) was conducted. If resources were available, patients were started on ECMO and then transferred to an ECMO center, but patients were not referred if resources were already at capacity. Patients transferred to other regional ECMO centers were started on the treatment after arrival at the ECMO facility.

"Even when saving ECMO for the youngest, healthiest and sickest patients, we could only provide it to a fraction of patients who qualified for it," lead author Whitney Gannon, MSN, MS, said in a Vanderbilt news release. "I hope these data encourage hospitals and federal authorities to invest in the capacity to provide ECMO to more patients."

61% of patients didn't receive ECMO
-----------------------------------
The health system didn't maintain a waiting list for ECMO because of the short eligibility window for ECMO after tracheal intubation and the long average length of ECMO for patients already receiving the treatment.

Among 240 COVID-19 patients referred for ECMO, 26 (10.8%) didn't complete the referral evaluation, 44 (18.3%) didn't meet the criteria for severity of lung injury, 80 (33.3%) had contraindications to treatment, and 90 (37.5%) were eligible for ECMO. Median patient age was 40 years, and 27.8% were female.

A total of 55 patients (61.1%) were not transferred to an ECMO facility and didn't receive the therapy because of a shortage of resources. As many as 49 of these patients (89.1%) died in the hospital, versus 15 of 35 patients (42.9%) who received ECMO (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.43).

The health system had ECMO capacity for 35 patients (38.9%), of whom 24 were started on the treatment at the hospital before transfer to an ECMO facility, while 11 were transferred to another regional center. Eight of the 11 patients were started on treatment after arrival at the center, and 3 died or developed a contraindication to ECMO after arrival but before treatment was started. Characteristics of both groups of patients were similar at the time of referral.

Senior author Jonathan Casey, MD, said that the study adds evidence that ECMO works. "Because some patients die despite receiving ECMO, there has been debate about how much benefit it provides," he said. "This study shows the answer is a huge benefit. This data suggests that, on average, providing ECMO to 2 patients will save a life and give a young person the potential to live for decades."

Coauthor Matthew Semler, MD, said that many people not working in medicine during the pandemic struggled to understand the reality of "strained" or "overwhelmed" hospitals. "This article helps make those effects tangible," he said. "When the number of patients with COVID-19 exceeds hospital resources, young, healthy Americans die who otherwise would have lived."

In the past 24 hours, 27 countries including South Korea (138 993), Japan (120 539), Russia (106 920), Germany (95 396), UK (81 936), the USA (79 586), Turkey (64 275), Switzerland (36 529), Hong Kong (34 466), The Netherlands (28 854), Indonesia (25 054), Australia (23 371), Malaysia (23 100), Thailand (20 420), Austria (20 210), Chile (19 619), Brazil (19 516), Singapore (18 597), Italy (18 278), New Zealand (17 991), Greece (16 263), Israel (16 065), Denmark (15 734), Singapore (13 544), France (13 483), Belgium (13 280), Iran (10 962), and Norway (10 394) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 7399 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 26 Feb 2022 to late 27 Feb 2022). The 7-day averages now indicate a decreasing global trend for cases and an increasing trend for deaths.

A total of 60 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 30 of the 60 countries are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 10 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 from the South East Asia region, and 0 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 12.7 %, while daily reported deaths have increased by 2.7 %. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 20.2% decrease in daily reported cases and a 6.8% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 1.23 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 437.22 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.97 million reported deaths. There has been a downward trend in the number of cases and deaths globally, however, transmission levels are still quite high. - Mod.UBA]
