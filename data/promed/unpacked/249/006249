Since the beginning of 2018, the health authorities in 2 districts of Lower Saxony (LK) have frequently registered cases of tuberculosis (TB) illness among slaughterhouse workers, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) reports (Epi Bull 26/2019 at https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2019/Ausgaben/26_19.pdf;jsessionid=B98830AC54DAEEA04BD0566EC774030D.1_cid381?__blob=publicationFile; German).

13 employees had become infected and one person had died as a result of the disease. The persons infected are predominantly Romanian workers.

During 2018 and up to 28 Feb 2019, 7 slaughterhouse workers who slaughtered and processed pigs (slaughterhouse A) were diagnosed with active pulmonary TB, 3 of them in September and October 2018. One of the patients died in November 2018 as a result of TB.

In the neighbouring district, 6 slaughterhouse workers with active pulmonary TB who were employed in slaughterhouse B (also pig processing) were reported since the beginning of 2018. Slaughterhouse A and B are about 40 km [about 25 miles] apart.

After the infection became public, extensive investigations by health authorities followed. Of the 96 contact persons tested at slaughterhouse A, 59 (61%) showed a positive test result [presumably this refers to tuberculin skin testing or interferon-gamma release assays for detection of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) - Mod.ML]. At slaughterhouse B no additional case of TB requiring treatment were detected [it is unclear if "no additional case of TB" refers to active pulmonary TB or LTBI - Mod.ML].

"For the most part, the strains identified were different strains of TB [presumably by genotyping? - Mod.ML], suggesting that the infection was acquired not from a single source and most likely not in the local region," the RKI report says. So far, no case of TB in humans has been described which is linked to contact with pigs or the consumption of pork or pork products.

Therefore there is no reason to suspect a transmission of TB pathogens from slaughtered livestock to slaughterhouse workers, according to the RKI.

[ProMED-mail thanks Sabine Zentis for the submission and translation of the news report above.

The _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex (MTC) is a genetically related group of _Mycobacterium_ species that can cause tuberculosis in humans or other animals; the various species within the MTC differ in terms of host tropism. MTC includes _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (_M. tb_), _M. africanum_, _M. bovis_, _M. microti_, _M. canettii_, _M. caprae_, _M. pinnipedii_, _M. suricattae_, _M. mungi_, _M. dassie_, and _M. oryx_. The human pathogen is most commonly _M. tb_, and less frequently _M. bovis_ and _M. africanum_; these species cause a similar clinical picture in humans. However, the standard nucleic acid amplification assay will only identify these species as "_M. tuberculosis_ complex," and commonly clinical laboratories do not speciate the human pathogen further.

Presumably, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) has identified the pathogen as _M. tuberculosis_ in the 13 employees at the 2 pig slaughterhouses in Lower Saxony, Germany. Strains of _M. tb_ isolated from these cases are said to be different, presumably on the basis of genotyping, which suggested that the infections were not acquired from a single source locally, implying that the infections were acquired in the workers' countries of origin, which for most of the infected slaughterhouse workers is Romania. We are told that transmission of TB pathogens from slaughtered livestock to slaughterhouse workers is not believed to have occurred.

Although we are not told the total number of slaughterhouse workers at these 2 affected facilities, nevertheless, 13 employees found to have active pulmonary TB in 2018 and the 1st 2 months of 2019 seems unusual. Because zoonotic transmission of TB is a known occupational hazard for slaughterhouse workers, pre-employment and periodic on-the-job screening programs for TB in slaughterhouse workers would seem to be important. We are not told if such a program was in place at these slaughterhouse facilities. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML]

[Swine are natural hosts for mycobacterial infections. The most common cause of swine tuberculosis is _M. avium_, but infection with mammalian tubercle bacilli, including _M. tuberculosis_, _M. bovis_, and _M. africanum_, occur coincidently with infections of cattle, wildlife, and humans with these agents. The susceptibility of swine to infection with _M. bovis_ has led to the use of feral swine as a sentinel species in New Zealand to detect the bacterium, known to be spread there by opossums.

Lesions occurring in swine naturally infected with _M. bovis_ and _M. tuberculosis_ are indistinguishable. - Mod.AS
