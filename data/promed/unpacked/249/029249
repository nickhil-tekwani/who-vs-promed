The farm ministry plans to slaughter all pigs and cows within a 10-km
[6.2-mi] radius of the areas hit by foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in
Miyazaki Prefecture to contain the spread of the infection,
government sources said Wednesday [19 May 2010].

A total of 135 000 cows and pigs will be given vaccines before they
are slaughtered, the sources said. The Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry and Fishers is set to make an announcement on the matter
later Wednesday [19 May 2010].

The areas subject to the slaughter involve 4 towns and surrounding
areas, including the town of Kawaminami. The government is making
arrangements to pay compensation to farmers worth 600 000 yen [approx
USD 6500] per cow and 40 000 [approx. USD 435] per pig, the sources said.

On Tuesday [18 May 2010], the farm ministry's expert panel on
tackling the FMD advised the government to consider using vaccines as
it has become quite difficult to prevent the spread just by
slaughtering livestock.

To contain the infection, the farm ministry has judged that it would
be necessary to slaughter healthy cows and pigs in the area where the
prefecture bans farmers from moving their livestock to prevent the
disease from spreading.

Vaccines can control the symptoms and delay the infection from
spreading but it does not completely prevent livestock from being
infected with the disease.

"It is important to take swift vigorous measures to prevent the
spread of the infection," Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama told reporters.

Meanwhile, Hatoyama denied that the government or the prefectural
government is responsible for the spread of the disease.

The government on Wednesday [19 May 2010] decided to vaccinate and
slaughter all livestock within a 10-km [6.2-mi] radius of farms hit
by an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in 4 Miyazaki Prefecture towns.

Officials made the decision after concluding that there was a need to
speedily control the spread of the disease to save time for the
slaughter of cattle.

The government will also consider providing compensation to farmers
outside the designated areas who have been affected by the outbreak.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries,
some 118 000 head of [pigs and cattle] known to have contracted the
disease or strongly suspected to have it were due to be slaughtered
as of Wednesday morning [19 May 2010], but so far only 60 000 have
been culled. In the meantime the highly contagious disease continues to spread.

To control the speed of infections, livestock within a 10-km radius
of affected farms in the 4 Miyazaki Prefecture towns of Tsuno,
Kawaminami, Takanabe, and Shintomi will be vaccinated [see map at
<http://fc-miyazaki.com/english/access/index.html>]. Eventually, all
of the animals will be slaughtered to prevent the disease from spreading.

It will be the 1st time for vaccines to be used in Japan as a measure
against FMD.

The government has enough vaccines for the O-type virus that is
currently circulating to cover 700 000 head of livestock. It is
expected that about 100 000 more cows and pigs within a 10-km radius
of the affected areas would be subject to vaccinations.

Use of a vaccine would not completely prevent infections, but if an
animal were infected, emission of the virus could be controlled to a
certain degree. Since the spread of infections would slow down, the
number of animals that would need to be slaughtered would decrease,
thus buying more time.

When questioned Monday [17 May 2010] over criticism from opposition
parties that Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Hirotaka
Akamatsu was slow in responding to the outbreak, Prime Minister Yukio
Hatoyama indicated that priority would be placed on controlling the
disease rather than pursuing officials' responsibility.

"What is important is to take strong, prompt measures to prevent the
spread of infections. This is something that comes before determining
where the responsibility lies," he said.

[A somewhat similar FMD control policy was applied in the Netherlands
in 2001, designated "vaccination to kill". However, from the
available information it seems that the initial aim of the
vaccination on affected premises in Japan is mainly to prevent
increased virus emission from the animals whose culling has been
delayed and further spread within the area already contaminated.

Further details on the vaccination programme are anticipated with
interest; a plausible plan will include early preventive vaccination
within an area around the zone declared as infected.

As of 18 May 2010, the total number of FMD outbreaks in Miyazaki has
reached 131, of which 118 in Kawaminami, 4 in Ebino, 4 in Takabane, 3
in Tsuno, and 2 in the most recently affected Shintomi. - Mod.AS]
