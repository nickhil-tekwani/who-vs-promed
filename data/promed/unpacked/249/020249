Argentinian Hemorrhagic Fever Deaths in Pergamino, Bueonos Aires
----------------------------------------------------------------
A truck driver (42) died yesterday of Argentinian hemorrhagic fever (AHF)
at a hospital in Pergamino, Province of Buenos Aires, reported the National
Institute of Human Viral Diseases "Julio Maiztegui," which is located in
the same city. According to the Director of the Institute, 30 cases have
occurred so far this year, with one previous death in February.
AHF is caused by Junin virus [an arenavirus carried as a persistent
infection by at least 3 species of wild rodents - Mod.CP, which is
transmitted by aerosols from rodent detritus. It is prevalent in
Northwestern Buenos Aires, Southern Santa Fe, Northeastern La Pampa, and
Southeastern Cordoba [provinces.
AHF can be controlled by a vaccine formerly produced by the Salk Institute,
Pennsylvania, USA. The Institute has stopped its production because the
disease is not endemic in the United States. The Pergamino Institute has
been responsible for its production since 1991 but lack of funds has meant
that it has been unable to prepare an adequate supply of vaccine to
immunize the population at risk.

[Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) was first described in the rich
agricultural zones of the pampas in 1958. With the expansion of agriculture
the disease has spread so that it now affects a wider area and infects
several hundreds of people annually. AHF has a case-fatality rate of 15-30
percent when untreated. The at-risk population is estimated at 3 500 000
inhabitants. Candid 1, an effective live attenuated virus vaccine, was
developed through an international cooperative project involving the
Government of Argentina, the Pan American Health Organization, the United
Nations Development Programme, and the United States Army Medical Research
and Development Command. Unfortunately, financial problems have restricted
the production and utilization of Candid 1. According to the GIDEON
database, most cases of this vaccine-preventable disease occur in Cordoba,
Buenos Aires, and Santa Fe provinces, and the peak year was 1964 with over
3000 cases, with 120 cases in each of 1993 and 1994. - Mod.CP
