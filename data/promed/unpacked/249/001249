Answer to: Peter Singfield <snkm@btl.net>
It is the purpose of PROMED and specific infectious diseases forum to
receive informations like yours. It is the duty of recipients of such
messages to try to participate in solving local problems. What happened in
Belize raises the problem of how to cope with local problems like the one
you had for rabies.
The first problem concerns the eventual availability of vaccines for
post-exposure treatment of patients. Maybe we should think of an
International Foundation capable [of forwarding vaccines and
immunoglobulin in [an emergency, once the need is identified.
The second point concerns laboratory examinations of samples. There are
several WHO collaborative reference centers in the Americas, in Europe and
Asia which can afford to perform the analysis from any country, provided
the samples are mailed in good condition. Our laboratory receives a lot of
samples and either diagnosis, [or antibody titration and virus typing are
performed for rabies. International communication and transportation
systems are fast enought to have immediate responses.
PROMED and the rabies listserv should be directly used for these purposes:
solve problems, besides forwarding information.
[I agree with Henri's comments wholeheartedly. At ProMED-mail, we are
always gratified when people from various places around the world who are
in electronic contact through ProMED-mail, use that platform and then work
together to have a public health impact. Hopefully, this kind of team
building will loom large in our collective futures. This series of
postings on rabies shows how global electronic communication provides
"value added" information transfer. - Mod. pc

The information provided by Henry Tsiang is very important as it is the
service provided worldwide by the Pasteur Institute. However, for the sake
of a fast response, the health authorities of the
neighboring countries should be contacted. El Salvador, Costa Rica,
Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama have diagnostic
laboratories, [controlled either [by health or agriculture authorities.
They should be more than willing to help.
Furthermore, Guatemala used to, and probably is now preparing suckling
mouse brain vaccine (SMBV), an excellent product which has helped to
control rabies (canine and bovine) in most Latin American countries.
Argentina is a good example of this. In 1976, the metropolitan area of
Buenos Aires (more than 10 millon inhabitants) had more dog rabies cases
(4700) than any other country in the Americas. With SMBV, the disease was
controled and no rabies cases have been registered since 1984. It was the
first time that rabies was eliminated from a city of that size, in the
history of the disease.
The Pan-American Health Organization should also be contacted for
cooperation in Belize.
