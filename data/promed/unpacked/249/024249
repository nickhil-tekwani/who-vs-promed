Suspected bird flu patient dies in Soc Trang
--------------------------------------------
Veterinarians have quarantined and disinfected hamlet 23 in Chau Hung
commune, Thanh Tri district, Soc Trang province, after a female
villager suspected of contracting the deadly H5N1 virus died in
hospital on Fri 20 Mar 2009. According to Vo Ngoc Linh, head of the
Chau Hung commune medical centre, the 26-year-old woman ate sick
ducks nearly a month ago. She was admitted to the general hospital of
nearby Bac Lieu province on 16 Mar 2009 with symptoms such as
headache, exhaustions and coughing. The unfortunate patient died
early in the morning of 20 Mar 2009. The result of blood tests will
be announced in the coming days.

Meanwhile, another suspected case in the southern province of Dong
Thap has tested negative for the deadly virus, according to doctors
from the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City.
