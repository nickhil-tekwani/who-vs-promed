The Montana Raptor Conservation Center reported on their Facebook page they rescued a bald eagle on Tuesday [23 Feb 2021] suffering from lead poisoning. According to the post, the amount of lead found in the eagle was too high to register on their system.

The center said they have rescued 11 eagles so far this year [2021] and 9 were tested for lead poisoning. All 9 tested positive.

The center also stated that switching to non-lead hunting and fishing products could prevent thousands of eagles and scavenging animals from lead poisoning per year.

The Raptor Resource Project (RRP) of Decorah said male eaglet, D35, was found dead near the Iowa River outside Iowa City on 29 Jan 2021. RRP reports members of Saving Our Avian Resources (SOAR) found the bird buried in the snow with no visible wounds.

SOAR Director Kay Neumann later concluded lead poisoning to be the cause of death. Neumann said the bird ingested a lead pellet. It was found in its stomach during a necropsy.

RRP said lead poisoning is the leading cause of mortality in eagles. Eagles ingest lead as they feed on carcasses that contain lead from hunter's shotgun and rifle shells. RRP urged hunters to use non-lead options when hunting to protect anyone who eats the game, and prevent lead-related deaths in non-target species.

It's been a rough start of the year [2021] for bald eagles in Maine. In just the past week, Avian Haven took in 4 bald eagles suffering from lead poisoning.

Unfortunately, all 3 adults died from extremely high levels of lead in their system. But they're still trying to save a young eagle by administering chemical agents to remove lead in its bloodstream. The young eagle is thin and weak, but is still alive and able to stand, Avian Haven said.

Eagles ingest lead by eating animals who've been shot. Animal conservationists encourage hunters to use shotgun shells and bullets that are not made of lead.

A Regina wildlife rehabilitation centre is raising awareness after 2 sick bald eagles found days apart, died of lead poisoning. "We know they are such stoic, strong birds; it will take a lot for them to show any weakness," said Megan Lawrence, Salthaven West Rehabilitation Director.

Lawrence says in December [2020], 2 bald eagles were rescued east of Estevan, Saskatchewan. She says both were weak, emaciated, dehydrated and barely able to stand.

"After we received the 1st one, we knew it was a high probability of poison in that area," Lawrence said. "They both lasted only about 48 hours in care before passing away."

With coyote carcasses in the area where the eagles were found, Lawrence suspected they [the coyotes] had been shot with lead ammunition. She says because bald eagles are scavengers, it's likely they would have eaten the carcasses. [A necropsy] later confirmed her suspicions regarding the lead poisoning.

According to a study by the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, the number one cause of death in bald eagles in Saskatchewan is poisoning. "We learned slightly more than 50% of bald eagles submitted to our diagnostic lab in Saskatoon here (between 1999 and 2012) died of poisonings," said Trent Bollinger, Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative regional director.

Bollinger says [those poisonings include] both insecticides and lead, with the majority of cases happening during the winter.

"Certainly, by far, the largest causes of mortality in these eagles are related to human activities," said Bollinger. "We're seeing them at a time when there's lead bullets present in carcasses or animals which haven't been retrieved, or they've been dressed out and the organs are left behind which might have residues of lead shots in them."

More than 2 decades ago the Canadian government banned lead for hunting migratory game birds, but lead ammunition is still used for hunting large game.

"We continue to see lead poisoning in eagles and in other raptors fairly regularly," Bollinger said. "It seems to be unchanged from previous years and we're also seeing this right through North America."

Lawrence says she wants to see lead banned altogether, to help prevent another tragic death. "It's a problem in every rehab center where eagles are coming in," Lawrence said. "Almost all of them will test positive for lead. So, I know we'd like to see definitely less use of lead out there."

[Carcasses that have been shot with lead ammo and not retrieved are a direct source of lead pellets for scavengers. Also, in areas of heavy hunting, the lead concentration in tissues of apparently healthy prey may be very high, and this dissolved lead is then transferred to predators, scavengers, people who eat hunted birds, or to the soil and water.

The following is extracted from an article by Manning et al. at https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0300985818813099\. Please see this source URL for complete references and figures:

"Lead toxicity due to ingestion of spent ammunition is an ongoing cause of mortality in bald eagles. While gross and histologic lesions of lead intoxication have been described in a few individuals of this species, the prevalence of lesions is underreported. A retrospective study of 93 bald eagles with severe lead intoxication was performed to describe the associated lesions and their prevalence and to compare the lesions with blood, liver, kidney, and/or bone lead concentrations. Gross lesions associated with lead toxicity were most frequent within the heart (51/93 birds) and consisted of multifocal myocardial pallor and rounding of the apex. Within the brain, gross lesions included petechiae or hemorrhagic necrosis (13/93 birds). Histologic lesions compatible with lead toxicity occurred within the heart (76/93 birds), brain (59/93 birds), and eyes (24/87 birds). Lead toxicity in bald eagles is characterized by fibrinoid necrosis of small- to medium-caliber arteries, most commonly affecting the heart, brain, and eyes. Gross and histologic lesions are consistent with ischemia caused by a primary vascular injury. A blood lead concentration of greater than 4 ppm and markedly elevated liver lead concentrations were associated with a greater likelihood of lesions in the heart. Severe lead intoxication is frequently associated with lesions that are histologically detectable in bald eagles. The presence of fibrinoid arterial necrosis and parenchymal degeneration, necrosis, and/or hemorrhage within the heart, brain, and/or eyes is suggestive of lead toxicity in bald eagles and warrants evaluation of liver or bone lead concentrations.

"Lead toxicity in bald eagles (_Haliaeetus leucocephalus_) is primarily associated with scavenging of carcasses or offal from animals that have been killed with lead-based ammunition (5,22,25,26,32,36,37). Lead-intoxicated bald eagles may demonstrate neurologic, ocular, gastrointestinal, and/or respiratory clinical signs or may be found deceased (8,10,14,20,25). A review of eagles submitted to the National Wildlife Health Center between 1975 and 2013 found trauma and poisonings to be the most frequent causes of death of bald eagles, with lead intoxication accounting for 63.5% of diagnosed poisonings (33).

"While elevated lead concentrations in blood, liver, kidney, and/or bone have been frequently reported in bald eagles (4,13,14,21,23,27,36,38,39), gross and histologic lesions in bald eagles with lead toxicity are mostly limited to small numbers of animals (8,23,25,30) with only one previous publication of a large series (11). Blood lead concentrations of 1 ppm or greater are considered evidence of severe incurable lead poisoning in bald eagles (36).

"Gross and histologic lesions in bald eagles with lead toxicity have been described in the heart, gastrointestinal tract, and infrequently within the brain, eye, and kidney, with an underlying vascular insult suspected (6,8,23,25,30). In 5 bald eagles with experimentally induced lead toxicity, medial fibrinoid necrosis of small arterioles was occasionally observed within the ventriculus, proventriculus, liver, spleen, heart, and kidney (30). In previous reports of lead toxicity in bald eagles, there has been sporadic documentation of areas of pallor in the heart corresponding histologically to cardiomyopathy, myocardial degeneration, and/or fibrosis (11,23). Lesions within the brain of bald eagles with lead toxicity have only been infrequently reported and are grossly characterized by red to brown discoloration or red pinpoint foci (6,23).

"The purpose of this retrospective study was to describe gross and histopathologic lesions associated with severe lead toxicity (1 ppm or greater blood lead concentration), including their distribution and prevalence of lesions in a large series of bald eagles. Blood, liver, kidney, and/or bone lead concentrations were analyzed to determine if these were correlated with the presence and distribution of lesions and if blood lead concentrations were correlated with lead concentrations in the liver, kidney, or bone."
