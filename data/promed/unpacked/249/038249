A man died from flesh-eating bacteria [necrotizing fasciitis - Mod.LL] in what is now the 4th case linked to Hurricane Harvey since the storm 1st made landfall 2 months ago.

A 31-year-old carpenter living in Galveston, TX was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis, an infection that causes the body's soft tissue to die, KHOU reported. He was helping demolish homes in the region after Hurricane Harvey and died on 16 Oct 2017, just 6 days after he went to the hospital with an infected wound on his left arm.

It's most likely this person's infection occurred when bacteria from Harvey debris or floodwater entered his body through a wound or cut," said Dr. Philip Keiser, Galveston County Local Health Authority. The Galveston County Health Department also pointed out that the infection was not related to the bacterium, _Vibrio vulnificus_, which is naturally found in beach water.

The death comes after a 77-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man both died from necrotizing fasciitis in the floodwaters of Harvey. A former firefighter who kayaked in the floodwater to check on his neighbors, survived an episode thought to be triggered by an infected insect bite.

[Necrotizing fasciitis, also called "flesh-eating disease," is a rapidly progressive infection that destroys the soft tissues covering muscle (fascia). Most commonly, the pathogen enters the body through a break in the skin, like a cut, scrape, burn, insect bite, or puncture wound. Most people who get necrotizing fasciitis have other health problems that include diabetes, kidney disease, cancer, or other chronic health conditions that weaken the body's immune system.

Patients usually complain of intense pain in the involved region that initially may seem out of proportion to the external appearance of the overlying skin. Aggressive surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue and administration of antibiotics are necessary. However, surgical intervention is often delayed after hospital admission, because these infections can be difficult to recognize in their early stages, and deep muscle necrosis may not be appreciated early on. The commonest type of bacteria causing necrotizing fasciitis is _Streptococcus pyogenes_ (group A streptococcus or GAS), but fungi (such as Mucor) and other bacteria, such as _Aeromonas hydrophila_, _Vibrio vulnificus_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, and mixtures of multiple aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species, can cause necrotizing fasciitis.

Overall, GAS are the most common causes of necrotizing fasciitis. Each year in the USA, GAS cause about 650-800 cases of necrotizing fasciitis (an incidence rate of about 0.2 per 100 000), and the CDC says that the incidence is not rising (http://www.cdc.gov/features/necrotizingfasciitis/).

Most cases of necrotizing fasciitis likely occur randomly and are not linked to similar infections in others. However, GAS infections can be highly contagious: skin lesions, poor personal hygiene, and crowded conditions, e.g., in shelters for the homeless, would be expected to facilitate GAS spread from person to person. Some strains of GAS are more virulent than others. Streptococcal M protein is the major virulence factor of GAS, which has been divided into serotypes based on the antigenic differences in the M protein molecule. GAS are now typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the emm gene that encodes M serospecificity (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/strep/M-ProteinGene_typing.htm). Genotyping identified GAS genotype emm-59 in half of the cases in an outbreak of invasive GAS disease among the homeless and intravenous drug users in Thunder Bay, Ontario (ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A, emm-59, fatal - Canada: (ON) Archive Number: 20081011.3219). - Mod.LL
