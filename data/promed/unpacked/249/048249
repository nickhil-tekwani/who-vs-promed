I have working for the Arizona Department of Health Service's, Vector-borne
and Zoonotic Diseases Section for more than six years, and was aboard when
the 1993 HPS outbreak occurred. Because I am a physical anthropologist by
training, I became very concerned for friends and colleagues working in the
excavating a sites in the Southwest. I have since published guidelines for
hantavirus risk reduction for
archaeologists, physical anthropologists, bioarchaeologists, and forensic
personnel. For those interested, these articles are cited below.
Fink, T. Michael. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and Southwestern
Archaeologists: a protocol for risk reduction. The Kiva 1994;59(3):363-365.

---- Rodents, human remains, and North American hanataviruses: risk
factors and prevention measures for forensic science personnel-a review.
Journal of Forensic Science 1996; 41(6):1052-1056
Fink, T.M, and P.S. Zeitz. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and field
archaeology: guidelines for risk reduction. Journal of Field Archaeology
1996; 23(4):471-476.
I concur that hantavirus infections probably occurred among the prehistoric
peoples of the American Southwest (and elsewhere in the world), but
paleopathological evidence for this will be difficult to obtain. Perhaps in
the future as paleoantigenic analysis continues to develop and is refined
(see Scientific American 1992, Vol. 266, No. 5, pp. 114-119) it may be
possible to detect antibody to hantavirus in ancient human and
rodent skeletal remains. At, present, however, discerning the antiquity of
hantaviral disease remains problematic.

[Thanks very much to Mike Fink for this extremely useful reply to our
request for information. I am embarrassed to say that I have not seen any
of these papers but, henceforth, I will have them available should someone
again ask these questions re: archaeology and risk of hantavirus infection.
