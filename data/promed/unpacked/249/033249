[Earlier reports] indicated that MSF offices [in Guekedou] were temporarily closed and reopened. "This is wrong," replied Marc Poncin, MSF emergency coordinator. "We never closed our offices nor asked our office workers to stay home, because we have patients that we are watching, but what is true is that we are concerned with intimidation that prevents us from working properly." He regretted the confusion around the disease: "People do not believe in the existence of Ebola, and it's really terrible."

The coordinator of MSF also recognizes that in some sub-prefectures like Tekoulo, where the prefect [mayor] went recently for awareness sessions, there are reservations. There, a few weeks ago, he said, people cut a bridge that leads to some villages to keep us from going there.

M. Poncin stated that if in Telimele 3 out of 4 patients come to the center for treatment, in Guekedou it is quite the opposite. "At Guekedou, patients always come late, and unfortunately we can do nothing," he lamented.

Some days ago, Marc Poncin emphasized that EVD should be considered like any other disease that can only be cured if the patient agrees to show up in time to treatment centers. He then stressed the need for relatives of people with characteristic symptoms of EVD to quickly transfer them to treatment centers to be examined and treated and that families should not hide these patients.

A Kiswahili language daily, Nipashe, this week [ending 5 Jul 2014] called on health authorities in Tanzania to take all necessary measures to prevent the deadly ebolavirus from entering the country. The latest epidemic of the disease began in West Africa in March [2014], and it has already claimed about 455 lives in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia [481 deaths as of 2 Jul 2014, see ProMED archive (81) below. - Mod.JW].

The paper suggested that well-equipped medical experts should be stationed at all border and other entry points for surveillance and prevention of viral transmission of the disease from affected countries. "If preventive measures are not taken, it is easy for the disease to spread from an affected neighbouring country. The public should take this matter seriously," the daily stressed.

[3] Low risk of international spread

Although the [Ebola] outbreak is obviously very serious, there is a very low chance that it will ever spread to other parts of the world, thanks to the low volume of international flights leaving the affected area.

In Conakry, Guinea, where the Ebola outbreak is prevalent, and which has an international airport, most flights remain local. "But 10 percent of the traffic goes to Paris," infectious disease specialist Kamran Khan told NPR [National Public Radio, USA]. So, if it were to spread, Paris would be the next stop.

Every GP in the country has been ordered to look out for symptoms of the killer ebolavirus in a scramble to stop the world's deadliest outbreak taking hold in Britain. Doctors have been sent new guidelines on how to deal with suspected cases of the virus, which kills [up to] 9 out 10 people it infects and is now sweeping through west Africa. British health officials have been dispatched to the affected areas in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, while Britain's port authorities have also been put on alert.

Although health officials say the risk is slight, they are concerned about people returning here after visiting their families in west Africa, and Sierra Leone in particular. They are also worried about an influx of visitors from the region this month [July 2014] for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

Prof. David Heymann, head of global health security at the think-tank Chatham House, said: "The virus appears to be stable, but there's a huge family of fever viruses, and there's always a chance of a mutation."

The virus was 1st detected in 1976, when it killed 280 people in the Congo. It causes death through multiple organ failure and internal bleeding, and there is still no cure or vaccine [but it is treatable if caught early. - Mod.JW].

It is spread through contact with bodily fluids, but there is some evidence it can be transmitted through water droplets in the air. The death toll from the latest outbreak is said to be 467, although experts fear this is a gross underestimate [officially 481, see ProMED archive (81) below].

Prof Dilys Morgan, from Public Health England, said: "Because the incubation period is up to 21 days, there's a slight risk that cases may turn up in the UK, but that risk is very low."

[MSF continues to report serious impediments placed in its way while trying to treat the EVD epidemic. Unless community leaders can convince their people that international staff are there to help them, it will be difficult to stem the epidemic.

It is highly commendable that one more African country is calling, importantly in the vernacular media, for a contingency plan to be made in case of the importation of ebolavirus cases. Although Tanzania is not at risk from cross-border traffic from West Africa, it is at risk from the Congo DR and Uganda, where ebolavirus is endemic (see map).

The original headline in the free Metro (UK) tabloid trumpeted that the ebolavirus has actually arrived in the UK. But it has not, and David Heymann was quoted out of context.

Any suspected EVD case arriving in western Europe (or the USA) would be quickly isolated and handled with strict infection control precautions and so would be highly unlikely to spread either inside a hospital or outside one.
