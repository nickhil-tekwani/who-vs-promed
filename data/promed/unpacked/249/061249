Signs of a disease similar to nodular dermatitis [lumpy skin disease, LSD] have been recorded in cattle in the Amangeldy district of the Kostanay [Qostana] region. In the veterinary department of the Kostanay region, this was explained as a post-vaccination reaction after the application of a live vaccine, a MIA Kazinform correspondent reported.

As informed by Bauyrzhan Beket, head (acting) of the Veterinary Department of Kostanay region, as of this year [2018], the Kostanay region belongs to the [LSD] protection zone in the republic. The symptoms of the disease, which were similar to those of LSD, were explained by a post-vaccination reaction. "According to the strategy of the Ministry of Agriculture in these 5 regions, vaccination against [LSD] was carried out in cattle. We fully completed this work this year [2018]. To this end, the Ministry of Agriculture has allocated vaccines.

No field cases of LSD have been registered; the vaccination is termed as "preventive." The mentioned cases are thus regarded as "post-vaccinal reaction" and at an acceptable rate. The animals, being fully susceptible, were vaccinated by this vaccine for the 1st time. The appearance of the reaction included signs that resemble the disease: elevated body temperature, keratoconjunctivitis, and a decrease in milk yield. No death cases have been reported, and recovery occurs within a week, usually in 3-5 days.

As it turned out, the agency recently visited the Amangeldinsky district, where the animals had the above signs of the disease. "They took a sample from one head, which fell, and today it is in the laboratory. But earlier we sent materials for research. Nodular dermatitis was not confirmed," Bauyrzhan Beket concluded.

[Kazakhstan reported to the OIE a single LSD outbreak in July 2016. It was, reportedly, located in the northwestern province of Mangyshlak. No additional outbreaks from Kazakhstan have been reported since. On the other hand, more than 30 LSD outbreaks have been confirmed in Russian territories bordering Kazakhstan since 2016, as can be seen in OIE's interactive map, updated Fri 3 Aug 2018, available at https://tinyurl.com/ycjyoy2g (click on the cluster bordering northwest Kazakhstan and zoom in).

On top of the said neighbouring outbreaks, 12 new LSD outbreaks in backyard holdings have spread recently throughout Russia's Kurganskaya oblast, along Kazakhstan's northern border, according to follow-up report No. 6 submitted by Russia to the OIE on Fri 3 Aug 2018. Of the 12 new outbreaks, 10 are facing Kazakhstan's Kostanay oblast, where the cases described as "post-vaccination reactions" were reported. The remaining 2 new outbreaks, in Russia's Kurganskaya oblast, are located more eastwards, adjacent to the North Kazakhstan province. For the follow-up report, including an interactive map presenting the 12 new outbreaks, see https://tinyurl.com/ydawbm9a.

In view of the above and several previous media reports about suspected LSD cases in Kazakhstan (see in "See Also" section), intensified LSD surveillance in Kazakhstan would be merited, as well as laboratory-backed investigation into the alleged vaccine-related etiology of the recent events in cattle in the Amangeldy district of the Kostanay region. - Mod.AS
