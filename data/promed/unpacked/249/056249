Otic Louse found on mule deer near Saratoga
-------------------------------------------
An adult mule deer [_Odocoileus hemionus_] buck collected from hunt
area 80 near Saratoga, Wyoming, was found to have a heavy infestation
of the exotic louse _Bovicola tibialis_. This is the 1st time this
nonnative external parasite has been documented in Wyoming.

According to Dr. Terry Kreeger, supervisor of Wyoming Game and Fish
Department (WGFD) veterinary services, the exotic louse is another
threat to mule deer populations. "Although it appears that this
current case is a rare finding, we expect the louse to spread slowly
over time," Kreeger said.

The deer was collected for necropsy on 3 Apr 2009 by Saratoga
Wildlife Biologist Will Schultz, and was necropsied by WGFD
veterinarian, Dr. Cynthia Tate, the same day. Dr. Tate noted severe
hair loss, skin inflammation and a heavy infestation of chewing lice.

Since it is difficult to distinguish native deer lice
(_Tricholipeurus lipeuroides_) from exotic ones, Dr. Todd Cornish,
associate professor/veterinary pathologist for the University of
Wyoming sent several specimens to Dr. James Mertins, veterinary
entomologist at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in
Ames, Iowa, who is an expert on the taxonomy of these species. On 5
May 2009, Dr. Tate was advised that both the exotic and native
species of lice were identified from this deer.

The normal host of this species of louse is fallow deer, which is
native to Europe and the Middle East. This introduced louse was 1st
identified on native free-ranging black-tailed deer in Washington
State in 2005. According to Cornish it is likely this exotic parasite
came to North America from a fallow deer imported quite some time ago.

Jay Lawson, chief game warden for the department said that finding an
exotic louse on our native mule deer once again reaffirms the wisdom
of the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission in their decision to deny an
application to import several species of exotic wildlife and open a
game farm nearly 20 years ago. "Based on the best information
available to us at the time, this type of unintended introduction was
one of many negative impacts possible if the Commission decided to
allow game farming in Wyoming," Lawson said.

According to Lawson, mule deer are a high priority species in
Wyoming. "Through the Mule Deer Initiative we have placed increased
emphasis on addressing the issues surrounding this wildlife icon of
our state," Lawson said. "The fact that we found this louse is
disappointing and yet another blow to mule deer in Wyoming."

"This exotic louse has not been reported in elk, moose, pronghorn or
bighorn sheep, but we do not know if they are susceptible or not at
the present time," Cornish said. "There is some concern that this new
disease may impact mule deer populations, particularly fawn winter
survival."

Dr. Rob Bildfell, veterinary pathologist at Oregon State University
Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Corvallis, said that experience
with other nonnative lice suggests that this species will have a
greater impact on deer with other factors already affecting their
overall condition. "These factors could include heavy loads of other
internal or external parasites, poor nutrition resulting from poor
habitat condition, injury, advanced or very young age and severe
winter conditions," Bildfell said.

According to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Web site,
<http://wdfw.wa.gov/factshts/hairloss.htm>, this exotic louse was
thought to be one factor in a large mule deer decline in eastern
Washington.

"If it affects Wyoming mule deer similarly to how it has affected
Washington state mule deer, then we would expect this parasite to be
a source of additional mortality in our herds, disproportionately
affecting fawns. Although treatable in captive deer, there is no
effective treatment for free-ranging deer," Kreeger said.

Deer infected with exotic lice tend to develop severe skin
irritation, leading to excessive grooming by the animal and eventual
patchy hair loss and loss of body condition. Lice infestations are
heaviest during winter and early spring. Normal seasonal hair loss or
molting can usually be distinguished from disease related hair loss
because the coat under the molt appears normal and healthy. According
to the Washington state Web site this exotic louse does not affect
humans or domestic livestock.

Anyone observing wildlife that appears sick is encouraged to contact
their local game warden or wildlife biologist or call their regional
Game and Fish office.

Although the louse finding may be a blow to the mule deer of Wyoming,
this article does not suggest how the louse got on a Wyoming deer.
The article explores why a game farm was not allowed, but it stops
short of suggesting mechanisms by which the louse was introduced,
despite the game farm not being allowed. - Mod.TG]
