[Starting in 1994, Sudan led successful efforts to eradicate polio. The last endogenous wild poliovirus case was reported in 2001. The last circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreak was reported in 2020, in which 9 positive cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus were reported from 7 Sudanese states and 2 from contacts were detected. Outbreaks of polioviruses in Sudan must be managed with several rounds of high-quality supplementary immunization campaigns. - Mod.MM]

[I have scoured the media in English and Arabic and have not found one with information on the virus type identified or any demographics on the infected individual. Hence, I am hoping a knowledgeable subscriber can share more details with us. - Mod.MPP

Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) - Indonesia
[19 Dec 2022]
------------------------------------------------------
Outbreak at a glance
On [12 Nov 2022], Indonesia's Ministry of Health notified WHO of a confirmed case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Pidie district in Aceh province. Field investigations were immediately launched by local and national public health authorities, with support from partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. On [28 Nov 2022], the Ministry of Health launched an immunization campaign for children under the age of 13 years in the affected areas.

Description of the outbreak
On [12 Nov 2022], Indonesia's Ministry of Health notified WHO of a confirmed case of VDPV2. The case was a 7-year-old boy from Pidie district in Aceh province, who developed AFP on [9 Oct 2022]. The case had not received oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and had no travel history or contact with those who had traveled. On [25 Nov 2022], 3 more genetically related isolates of cVDPV2 were reported based on the laboratory results of stool samples taken from 3 healthy children who were in the same community but not close contacts of the confirmed case. Sequencing results from Biofarma lab showed 25 nucleotide changes for the AFP case and 25 to 26 nucleotide changes for the 3 asymptomatic children. These results are evidence of transmission of the virus and meets the criteria to be classified as circulating VDPV2 (cVDPV2). In the past in Indonesia, a cVDPV type 1 outbreak was reported in Papua province in 2019.

Aceh province has very low polio vaccination coverage in the routine immunization programme; however, coverage is also low in several other provinces in Indonesia, including 3 provinces near Aceh (North Sumatera, West Sumatera, and Riau). In 2021, in Aceh province, bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV3) coverage was 50.9% and IPV was 28.2%, and for Pidie district, the coverage was 17.7% for OPV3 and 0.5% for IPV. There is low population immunity against all polioviruses but primarily type 2 in children born after the switch from the trivalent to bivalent OPV in April 2016.

Epidemiology of poliomyelitis
Polio is a highly infectious disease that largely affects children under 5 years of age, causing permanent paralysis (approximately 1 in 200 infections) or death (2-10% of those paralyzed). The virus is transmitted by person to person, mainly through the fecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (e.g., contaminated water or food) and multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis. The incubation period is usually 7-10 days but can range from 4-35 days. Up to 90% of those infected are either asymptomatic or experience mild symptoms, and the disease usually goes unrecognized.

Vaccine-derived poliovirus is a well-documented strain of poliovirus mutated from the strain originally contained in OPV. OPV contains a live, weakened form of poliovirus that replicates in the intestine for a limited period, thereby developing immunity by building up antibodies. On rare occasions, when replicating in the gastrointestinal tract, OPV strains genetically change and may spread in communities that are not fully vaccinated against polio, especially in areas where there is poor hygiene, poor sanitation, or overcrowding. The lower the population immunity, the longer this virus survives and the more genetic changes it undergoes.

In very rare instances, the vaccine-derived virus can genetically change into a form that can cause paralysis as does the wild poliovirus: this is what is known as a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV). The detection of VDPV in at least 2 different sources and at least 2 months apart, that are genetically linked, showing evidence of transmission in the community, should be classified as 'circulating' vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2). Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 continues to affect different areas of the world, notably in the African Region.

Public health response
The Ministry of Health has publicly announced the outbreak, and on [28 Nov 2022], immunization campaigns were launched for 1.2 million children under the age of 13 years in the province of Aceh.

Risk assessment and field investigations were immediately launched and are still ongoing by the local and national public health authorities, with support from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partners, including a more detailed assessment of the origin of the isolated viruses.

The Ministry of Health, with support from WHO, UNICEF, and other partners, is undertaking strong measures to stop the transmission. Measures include enhanced surveillance -- active search for AFP cases at health facilities and communities, assessment of OPV/IPV coverage through a rapid community survey in a sample of 200 households, and training on the surveillance guidelines for the use of novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2).

The WHO director general approved the release of the nOPV2 for rapid response on [25 Nov 2022] and a rapid vaccination response was initiated on [28 Nov 2022] in Pidie district (the affected district) with approximately 95 603 children aged under 13 years to be vaccinated.

A rapid response vaccination campaign was launched in Aceh province for those aged zero to 12 years on [5 Dec 2022]. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with nOPV2 are proposed for those aged zero to 12 years in Aceh and zero to 4 years in North Sumatera, West Sumatra, and Riau in the 1st week of January 2023 and the 1st week of February 2023.

Advocacy campaigns, risk communication messaging, and social mobilization have been implemented.

WHO risk assessment
WHO assesses the risk to be high at the national level due to low polio vaccination coverage in Aceh and other provinces in Indonesia, the susceptibility of the population to poliovirus type 2 after switching from trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOVP) to bOPV in April 2016 combined with low uptake of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), sub-optimal surveillance capacity, and vaccine hesitancy among the at-risk population.

The detection of cVDPVs highlights the importance of maintaining high levels of routine vaccination coverage everywhere to minimize the risk and consequences of the circulation of any poliovirus, as well as the need to ensure quality surveillance for early detection of any poliovirus.

WHO advice
It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases and commence any planned expansion of environmental surveillance in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories, and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

WHO's International travel and health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio.

As per the advice of the Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005) on the international spread of poliovirus, countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country that has had an importation of cVDPV2 with local transmission should (i) declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency, (ii) encourage residents and long-term visitors to receive a dose of IPV 4 weeks to 12 months prior to international travel, (iii) ensure that travellers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio vaccination status, (iv) further intensify efforts to increase IPV immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, and (v) intensify regional cooperation and cross-border coordination to enhance surveillance for prompt detection of poliovirus, and vaccinate refugees, travellers, and cross-border populations, according to the advice of the Advisory Group.

WHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions to Indonesia based on the information available for this current event.
