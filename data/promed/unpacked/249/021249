North Dakota has recorded its 3rd case of anthrax in cattle this year
[2010]. Deputy state veterinarian Beth Carlson says a single case of
anthrax has been confirmed in Barnes County. An anthrax case was
confirmed earlier this month [July 2010] in Dickey County. In May
2010, an anthrax case was confirmed in eastern Sioux County.

State animal health officials are urging producers to have their
cattle vaccinated against the illness and to report unexpected deaths
in their herds to veterinarians.

North Dakota usually has a few anthrax cases every year. In 2005, the
disease resulted in an estimated 1000 dead cattle, bison, horses,
sheep, llamas and farmed deer and elk.

[One of the abilities of the anthrax spores is to show up ranchers
who have failed to vaccinate their stock, in spite of the
instructions issued by the state's veterinary service/animal health
commission. Sporadic outbreaks occur throughout the summer. If all
goes well, it is just the odd animal. - Mod.MHJ]
