On Tue 5 Jul 2022, the Directorate of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (DAAF) of Reunion was informed of a suspicion of the presence of adult individuals of _Aethina tumida_ (the small hive beetle) in an apiary in the south of the island. Following the samples taken, the presence of this pest was confirmed on 6 Jul 2022 by the national reference laboratory (NRL) of ANSES Sophia-Antipolis. The diagnosis was made by morphological and behavioral analyzes established from photographs and videos taken by the local GDS and CIRAD and transmitted urgently to the LNR by the state services. Adult beetles were detected in 3 colonies out of the 17 present in the outbreak apiary, and no eggs or larvae were found. Samples, transported by plane, will be subject to additional examinations by the NRL. Molecular analyzes (PCR and sequencing) will be conducted to confirm the identification of the species _A. tumida_ and attempt to determine the geographical origin of the specimens detected.

This is the 1st discovery of this species on the national territory hitherto unscathed.

_Aethina tumida_ is a pest of bee and bumblebee colonies, categorized "D and E" in the European Union (regulation 2018/1882). This beetle is native to sub-Saharan Africa. It has been present in Calabria (Italy) since 2014 and was detected in Mauritius [see citation below] in 2017; it is also present in Madagascar. In France, this pest is assimilated to a category A1 disease.

The origin of this introduction has not yet been identified. Epidemiological investigations are in progress, and in-depth visits are and will be carried out in the apiaries of the regulated zones and in epidemiological connection with the confirmed outbreak, in application of the prefectural decree issued.

In view of the epidemiological information available, the objective of eradication is being pursued at this stage. Management measures adapted to the situation were immediately taken by prefectural decree. The colonies of the hearth apiary were euthanized and incinerated; a soil treatment will be implemented as soon as the burning operations are over. A restricted area of 10 km [6.2 mi] radius (5 km [3.1 mi] protection zone and 5 km surveillance zone around the protection zone) is set up around the outbreak. The measures provided for by the ministerial decree of 23 Dec 2009 apply in this area: census and examination of bee colonies; ban on the movement of hives, populated or not; bees; queens; bumblebees; equipment beekeeping; and beekeeping products.

The small hive beetle, _Aethina tumida_ (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae), is a parasite and predator of honeybees. Adults and larvae of small hive beetles feed on honeybee brood, honey, and pollen. While feeding on food stores, the remaining honey is fermenting, and the comb is destroyed. The beetles can promote structural collapse of the nest and cause the adult honeybees to abscond from severely infested colonies. The extent of beetle-associated damage depends on climate, colony strength, and other conditions. Small hive beetles tend to be more problematic in areas with warm temperatures and high humidity. The small hive beetle can be a serious problem in honey-extracting facilities where stored comb, honey, and wax cappings are potential feeding and breeding areas. Beetle development from egg to adult requires 3-12 weeks, depending on humidity, temperature, and food availability. The flying adult beetles actively infest honeybee colonies of all strengths and sizes.

The above and additional information on the parasite, its impact, and its diagnosis are available in WOAH's terrestrial Manual, chapter 3.2.5, at https://www.woah.org/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.02.05_SMALL_HIVE_BEETLE.pdf.

Réunion, an island in the Indian Ocean, is an overseas department and region of France. It is located approximately 950 km [590 mi] east of the island of Madagascar and 175 km [109 mi] southwest of the island of Mauritius. Like the other 4 overseas departments, Réunion also holds the status of a region of France and is an integral part of the French Republic.
