Pets can catch dangerous infections from their owners
-----------------------------------------------------
Scientists who worry about the spread of nasty germs from animals to people
have found the opposite can also happen: cats and dogs catch bad things
from their owners.
Canadian researchers documented 16 cases of dangerous, methicillin
resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) infections in horses, cats, and
dogs. They believe all of them probably began with owners or veterinarians
infecting the animals. The germ was until recently seen only in hospitals,
where it often spreads to elderly or especially ill people who have open
wounds or tubes. Healthy people may carry it on their skin without getting
sick.
"We've got some pretty strong evidence owners were responsible for their
companion animals developing MRSA soft tissue infections," said Dr Donald E
Low, chief microbiologist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. Low and his
colleagues presented the data at a meeting in Chicago of the American
Society for Microbiology. They found that the animals had resistant staph
infections genetically similar to the ones occurring in people. In some
cases, they showed the animals got sick months after their owners caught
identical germs.
Such transmission is often difficult to prove, but Dr Shelley Rankin, a
microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania, believes vets are seeing
it more often in domestic animals. "People think it only goes one way, from
animals to humans," she said. "This shows the other side of the story."
MRSA is passed through close person-to-person or person-to-pet contact,
which is one reason why hospitals constantly urge doctors and nurses to
wash their hands. In humans, staphylococci can cause pimples and boils as
well as much more serious conditions, such as pneumonia and lethal
bloodstream infections. The first [animal] case the Canadian researchers
examined was a 9 year old bishon frise operated on in January 2000 to
remove an eyelid cyst. Despite antibiotics, the dog developed a lingering
infection that turned out to be MRSA. The dog's owner had undergone surgery
in late 1999 for testicular cancer. While in the hospital, he, too, had
caught MRSA. Genetic tests to compare the germs from man and dog showed
them to be identical.
The researchers believe veterinary clinics can also serve as a source of
the bug -- just as hospitals spread the germ to sick people. Two cats and 1
dog with identical infections had all been treated at the same Quebec clinic.
The team documented 2 separate outbreaks of the infection involving 8
horses. One of them began when an Irish thoroughbred was admitted to a
large veterinary hospital for removal of melanoma cancer. Two days after
returning home, the horse developed an abscess caused by MRSA. The horse's
owner had undergone a hysterectomy 9 months earlier. The researchers
isolated MRSA from her nose, and the bacteria were identical to the
horse's. Two other horses got the same infection at the hospital a few
months later. The researchers found a surgical technician and a veterinary
student carried the same germ, suggesting they may have caught it from the
first horse and passed it on.
Before the introduction of antibiotics, staphylococcal infection was such a
big problem that wards and even entire hospitals sometimes had to be shut
down. The advent of penicillin at first stopped the bug, but it quickly
grew resistant. In 1960, methicillin became the standard treatment. The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that about half
of all hospital acquired staphylococcal infections in the United States --
80 000 a year -- are now resistant to methicillin, and they often are
impervious to other antibiotics, as well. Some can be treated only with
vancomycin, an injected drug, or "Zyvox" (linezolid), a drug introduced
last year that can also be taken by mouth.
For pets as well as people, staphylococcal infection can be
life-threatening. One of the dogs died, and another required amputation of
its infected leg. For several years, experts have warned overuse of
antibiotics on farms can promote the transmission of drug resistant
microbes from animals to people, what's known as zoonotic spread. However,
the Canadian researchers say they believe they have found evidence of a
different hazard - humanotic spread.

[For years veterinarians have known that diseases passed from people to
their animals. Many times veterinarians have seen the family pet brought in
for what appeared to be a cold, only to learn that family members had had
the cold a few weeks before. This is minor compared with MRSA, but issues
of diseases transmitting between species is not a one way street. It is
gratifying to veterinarians to have researchers prove that at least one
disease is transmitted both ways. - Mod.TG]
