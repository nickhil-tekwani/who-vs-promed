A 62 year old male resident of Thakre village development committee-3, Dhading district, presented (on 21 Aug 2016) to OPD of the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital with history of fever with chills, severe lower joint pain and red eyes for 13 days. An eschar was seen in the right axillary region, but he did not develop rash. He tested positive for scrub typhus (ELISA method). The patient was an earthquake victim and has been living with his family in the temporary shelter.

According to him, at least 70 people (relatives and neighbors) had developed fever with other symptoms similar to those of scrub typhus during that time, suggesting that a large outbreak of scrub typhus may have occurred in Dhading district.

According to the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, so far at least 176 people are reported to have contracted scrub typhus, and 5 of them have died. However, a large number of cases probably are being underreported, and the actual number of scrub typhus cases may be much higher than reported by the government.
