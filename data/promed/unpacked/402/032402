As Margibi County observes the absence of Ebola for more than 42 days without a new case, another disease has hit the county, killing at least 6 people. Speaking to reporters in Kakata, Margibi County on Friday [10 Apr 2015], the County Mobilization Coordinator for UNICEF, Sophie Reeves, disclosed that there are about 77 measles cases with 6 deaths reported in the county.

Madam Reeves, who also works with the Margibi County Health Team, explained that cases, which are found within the 4 health districts of Margibi, including Gibi, Mahnban Kaba, Marshall and Kakata, erupted 2 weeks ago, with Gibi district being highly hit by the disease. She described the outbreak as very scary and urged the people of Margibi to be very careful before the chain transmission rapidly increases in the county. Madam Reeves stressed that a single measles case should be considered an outbreak because it spreads too fast like a wide fire among the population.

Meanwhile, she noted that due to the nature of the cases in Gibi District, the county health team and its partners have decided to urgently take measles vaccine to Gibi ahead of the nationwide vaccination period set for 8-14 May 2015. According to her, the county health team and partners will today, Mon Apr 13 2015, take the measles vaccine to Gibi District. She warns that if the county health team does not reach the district now, more deaths could occur because Gibi is highly hit.

Madam Reeves has, meanwhile, warned the people of Margibi to refrain from calling the measles vaccine an Ebola vaccine, something, which noted, has already started to make many people afraid to take the vaccine.

Measles vaccine will target children between 6-59 months, or less than 5 years, while the polio vaccine will target 0-59 months, or under 5 years, and the worm tablets will target children 1-5 years old.

[2] USA (MMWR report)

Measles is a highly contagious, acute viral illness that can lead to complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. As a result of high 2-dose measles vaccination coverage in the United States and improved control of measles in the World Health Organization's Region of the Americas, the United States declared measles elimination (defined as interruption of year-round endemic transmission) in 2000 (1). Importations from other countries where measles remains endemic continue to occur, however, which can lead to clusters of measles cases in the United States.

To update surveillance data on current measles outbreaks, CDC analyzed cases reported during 4 Jan-2 Apr 2015. A total of 159 cases were reported during this period. Over 80 per cent of the cases occurred among persons who were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. Four outbreaks have occurred, with one accounting for 70 per cent of all measles cases this year [2015]. The continued risk for importation of measles into the United States and occurrence of measles cases and outbreaks in communities with high proportions of unvaccinated persons highlight the need for sustained, high vaccination coverage across the country.

Confirmed measles cases in the United States are reported by state and local health departments to CDC using a standard case definition (2). A measles case is considered confirmed if it is laboratory-confirmed or meets the clinical case definition (an illness characterized by a generalized rash lasting 3 days or more, a temperature of 101 F [38.3 C] or more, and cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis) linked epidemiologically to a confirmed case. Measles cases are laboratory confirmed if there is detection in serum of measles-specific immunoglobulin M, isolation of measles virus, or detection of measles virus nucleic acid from a clinical specimen. Cases are considered imported if at least some of the exposure period (7-21 days before rash onset) occurred outside the United States and rash occurred within 21 days of entry into the United States, with no known exposure to measles in the United States during that period. Import-associated cases include 1) imported cases, 2) cases that are linked epidemiologically to imported cases, and 3) cases for which an epidemiologic link has not been identified but the viral genotype detected suggests recent importation. An outbreak of measles is defined as a chain of transmission of 3 or more linked cases.

During 4 Jan-2 Apr 2015, a total of 159 measles cases (in 155 US residents and 4 foreign visitors) from 18 states and the District of Columbia were reported to CDC. Patients ranged in age from 6 weeks to 70 years; 26 (16 per cent) were aged under 12 months, 18 (12 per cent) were aged 1-4 years, 27 (17 per cent) were aged 5-19 years, 58 (36 per cent) were aged 20-39 years, and 30 (19 per cent) were aged 40 years or older. 22 patients (14 per cent) were hospitalized, including 5 with pneumonia. No other complications and no deaths have been reported.

A total of 111 cases (70 per cent) have been associated with an outbreak that originated in late December 2014 in Disney theme parks in Orange County, California. The source of the initial exposure has not been identified, but measles cases associated with this outbreak have been reported in 7 US states, Mexico, and Canada (3). Measles was laboratory confirmed in 101 (91 per cent) of these cases, either by detection of measles-specific IgM or of measles virus RNA. The B3 genotype was identified in specimens from at least 40 patients associated with this outbreak. B3 is a common measles genotype that has been identified in multiple states and countries (4). Other smaller measles outbreaks in 2015 without a link to Disney theme parks have been reported in Illinois (15 cases), Nevada (9), and Washington (5).

The majority of the 159 patients with reported measles in the 2015 outbreaks were either unvaccinated (71 [45 per cent]) or had unknown vaccination status (60 [38 per cent]); 28 (18 per cent) had received measles vaccine. Among the 68 US residents who had measles and were unvaccinated, 29 (43 per cent) cited philosophical or religious objections to vaccination, 27 (40 per cent) were ineligible because they were too young to receive vaccination (26 patients) or had a medical contraindication (one), 3 (4 per cent) represented missed opportunities for vaccination, and 9 (13 per cent) had other reasons for not being vaccinated.

Of the 159 measles cases, 153 (96 per cent) were import-associated. Ten cases were classified as direct importations, (6 among unvaccinated US residents returning from overseas travel, of whom 3 were aged 6-11 months and age-eligible for vaccination before departure, and 4 among foreign visitors). Countries associated with direct importations included Azerbaijan, China, Germany, India, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Qatar, Singapore, and United Arab Emirates (one import each).

Discussion
----------
High population immunity secondary to high measles vaccination coverage has maintained measles elimination in the US since declaration of elimination in 2000 (5). Worldwide, however, about 20 million measles cases occur annually, and importations to the US will continue to place unvaccinated populations at risk for measles. Measles transmission in pockets of unvaccinated persons increases the risk for transmission to vulnerable groups, such as those who cannot be vaccinated because of underlying medical conditions, or infants too young to be vaccinated.

As in previous years, a sizeable proportion of US residents who became infected with measles had an unknown vaccination status (6). This occurred primarily among adults and reflects the lack of immunization data in registries on adults in the United States. Among the US-resident patients who were confirmed as unvaccinated, the numbers who were ineligible for vaccination and who cited philosophical or religious beliefs as the reason they declined vaccination were similar. Exemptions from mandated immunizations have been shown to increase risk for acquiring disease as well as increasing the risk of a disease outbreak at the community level. Exemption rates are higher in jurisdictions where exemption requirements are procedurally easier to meet (7).

Health care providers should encourage vaccination of all eligible patients who do not have other evidence of measles immunity. Children without contraindications should receive their 1st dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine at age 12-15 months and a 2nd dose at age 4-6 years. Before international travel, infants aged 6-11 months should receive one dose of MMR and children aged 12 months and older should receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days. Adults born during or after 1957 who are at high risk for measles (i.e., health care personnel, international travelers, and students at postsecondary educational institutions) and who do not have other evidence of measles immunity should also receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Other adults without evidence of measles immunity should receive at least One dose of MMR vaccine. One dose of MMR vaccine administered to those aged 12 months or older is approximately 93 per cent effective at preventing measles and 2 doses approximately 97 per cent effective (8).

Measles should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with febrile illness and rash. Patients with clinical symptoms compatible with measles should be asked about recent travel abroad or contact with travelers, and their vaccination status should be verified. Patients with suspected measles should be promptly screened before entering waiting rooms and appropriately isolated (that is, in an airborne isolation room or, if not available, in a separate room with the door closed), or have their doctor's office appointments scheduled at the end of the day to prevent exposure of other patients (9). Serology as well as viral specimens should be collected for laboratory testing. Viral genetic sequencing can be used to detect the genotype of the infection, which can be used to suggest the source of an imported virus and track global transmission patterns (10). To assist state and local public health departments with rapid investigation and control efforts to limit the spread of disease, suspected measles cases should be reported to local health departments immediately. State health departments are required to notify cases of measles to CDC within 24 hours of detection.

Maintenance of high 2-dose MMR vaccine coverage has been crucial in limiting measles spread from importations in the United States. Most measles importations occur when US citizens travel abroad and have not been appropriately vaccinated. Therefore, it is important to encourage timely delivery of measles vaccination for US residents before overseas travel. In addition, early detection of cases and rapid public health response to outbreaks can serve to limit the spread of illness.

Florida's Department of Health has confirmed 2 cases of measles in 2 unvaccinated adults in Indian River County. Officials said on Sunday [19 Apr 2015] that both patients live in the same household. One acquired measles internationally, and the 2nd acquired the case at home on central Florida's Atlantic coast.

Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus. It can spread through the air, and the virus can survive up to 2 hours on surfaces or in a room where an infected person was coughing or sneezing. Symptoms including a rash, fever and coughing generally begin roughly 7 to 14 days after a person is exposed to someone with measles.

Indian River County Health Department Administrator Miranda Hawker urges all residents and visitors who have not been immunized to get vaccinated.

The California Health Department recently held a press conference announcing the end of the Disney measles cases. In mid-December last year [2014], triggered by Disney visitors' measles cases, 131 California residents were infected with measles, of which about 40 people were employees of Disney; 30 people were relatives of the families of these people; the rest were infected elsewhere.

Medical staff could never find the original source of infection, but it is believed to be tourists from abroad. Although the United States has announced that measles disappeared decades ago, in recent years, there have still been infections.

A Health Ministry spokesman said that the majority of people infected with measles were not vaccinated, while some people's vaccine history records are not available.

A research team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today [16 Apr 2015] fleshed out the picture of measles activity in the United States, much of it tied to a large Disney-linked outbreak, which highlights the ongoing threat from imported infections and unvaccinated Americans. Meanwhile, California health officials say the theme park outbreak is nearly over, while the CDC yesterday [15 Apr 2015] posted a travel notice about a dramatic spike in measles cases in Kyrgyzstan, one of 10 countries linked to imported cases in the United States this year [2015].

2015 US measles cases
---------------------
In the CDC's overview of measles activity so far this year [2015], published today [16 Apr 2015] in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), it said 159 cases were reported between 4 Jan and 2 Apr 2015. The agency said 111 of those cases (70 per cent) are linked to an outbreak that began in December 2014 at Disneyland in California, though a CDC update earlier this week placed the Disney-linked cases at 117. Three other smaller outbreaks have been reported in Illinois, Nevada, and Washington.

The total number of overall outbreak cases is 19 fewer, and the theme-park cases are 6 fewer than the CDC's previous measles updates. A spokesman from the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases told CIDRAP News today [16 Apr 2015] that numbers in the updates are provisional and subject to change as states review data. As states review data, they can reclassify cases, add retrospective cases, or identify rashes that occurred during a different time frame. He added that the drop in cases reflects infections reclassified from 2015 to 2014, all of them Disney-linked cases. Among the 159 outbreak cases, 22 people have been hospitalized for their infections, 5 of them with pneumonia. No deaths have been reported.

The vast majority of patients (131) were either unvaccinated or didn't know their vaccination status, the MMWR report said. Of the 68 Americans in the unvaccinated group, 29 cited philosophical or religious objections; 27 couldn't be vaccinated because they were too young or had a medical contraindication, and 12 weren't vaccinated for other reasons.

The researchers pointed out that 60 patients were adults who didn't know their vaccination status, showing the lack of immunization data in registries on adults. The CDC recommends that adults born after 1957 who don't have evidence of measles immunity and who are at high risk for the disease -- such as health providers or travelers -- receive 2 doses of the measles mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Other adults without evidence of measles immunity should get at least one MMR dose. The team also emphasized that vaccine exemptions increase the risk of getting sick and boost the risk of outbreaks in community settings.

Nearly all cases (153) were import-associated, 10 of them in travelers who contracted measles in other countries. Six patients were unvaccinated US residents, including 3 babies ages 6-11 months old who were eligible to receive the vaccine before departure.

Aside from Kyrgyzstan, the other countries linked to measles importations included Azerbaijan, China, Germany, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates.

Meanwhile, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) said in its most recent measles update that 134 cases have been reported in the state since December 2014, when the Disney-associated outbreak began.

The CDPH added that the outbreak will be considered over when 42 days have passed from the end of the incubation period for the last of the known B3 genotype measles cases that don't reflect a new importation. As of its 10 Apr 2015 update, the CDPH said the date the outbreak will be considered over is tomorrow, 17 Apr 2015. CDC has said that the outbreak was probably sparked by a traveler who was infected overseas then visited the park. However, the source hasn't been identified.

The B3 genotype is identical to the virus that caused a large outbreak in the Philippines in 2014, but it has recently been identified in 14 other countries and 6 US states that had cases not linked to the Disney outbreak.

Travel notice on Kyrgyzstan
---------------------------
In yesterday's [15 Apr 2015] travel notice, CDC said Kyrgyzstan is experiencing an ongoing measles outbreak, with more than 7400 cases reported from May 2014 through February 2015. It said a surge of infections have occurred this year [2015], with many hospitalizations and 2 deaths in children.

The agency recommended that travelers to the country ensure that they have been vaccinated against measles, especially babies ages 6-11 months old and other children.

[6] Philippines (Travel Report)
Date: 25 Mar 2015
Source: CDC Travel Health [abbreviated, edited]
http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/measles-philippines


According to the World Health Organization as of 20 Feb 2015, there were 58 010 suspected cases of measles, including 21 420 confirmed cases and 110 deaths in the Philippines during 2014. So far in 2015, there are 201 suspected cases of measles, including 33 confirmed cases and no deaths. In the United States during 2014, 25 US travelers who returned from the Philippines became sick with measles. Most of these cases were among unvaccinated people. WHO and the Philippines Department of Health are working to control the outbreak, including conducting vaccination campaigns.

CDC recommends that travelers to the Philippines protect themselves by making sure they are vaccinated against measles, particularly infants 6-11 months of age (one dose of measles vaccine) and children 12 months of age or older (2 doses of measles vaccine). Clinicians should keep measles in mind when treating patients with fever and rash, especially if the patient has recently traveled internationally.

People who cannot show that they were vaccinated as children and who have never had measles should be vaccinated. Infants 6-11 months of age should have one dose of measles vaccine if traveling internationally.

Children in the United States routinely receive measles vaccination at 12-15 months of age. Infants vaccinated before age 12 months should be revaccinated on or after the 1st birthday with 2 doses, separated by at least 28 days. Children 12 months of age or older should have 2 doses, separated by at least 28 days. Adolescents and adults who have not had measles or have not been vaccinated should get 2 doses, separated by at least 28 days. Two doses of MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine is nearly 100 per cent effective at preventing measles.

The only measles vaccines available in the United States are the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and the measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccines. MMR has been used safely and effectively since the 1970s. A few people experience mild, temporary adverse reactions, such as joint pain, from the vaccine, but serious side effects are extremely rare. There is no link between MMR and autism.
