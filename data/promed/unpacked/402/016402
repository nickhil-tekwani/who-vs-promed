["The occurrence of African swine fever was reported in almost half of the pig producing countries on the African continent in 2012. This transboundary animal disease poses a serious negative impact on production and productivity and thus affecting national economies and social structures of the pig producing countries.

The high economic losses are mainly associated with high mortality (up to 100%) caused by the disease. The outbreaks of African swine fever lead to lose of capacity to re-stock and produce, thus resulting in loss of livelihood of many poor farmers. It also reduces poor communities' access to high-quality and cheap animal proteins. For these reasons, African swine fever is considered the most serious infectious disease in pigs in Africa".

"In Namibia, the 1st confirmed outbreak of ASF occurred in 1932 in Okahandja district. Between 1932 and 1989 a further 41 confirmed ASF outbreaks occurred in the Okahandja, Omaruru, Gobabis, Grootfontein, Swakopmund, and Otjiwarongo districts of the country. ASF is, therefore, endemic in Namibia, particularly in the central areas of the country which are mostly commercial beef farms and where warthogs (_Phacochoerus africanus_) are widespread and roam unrestricted".
