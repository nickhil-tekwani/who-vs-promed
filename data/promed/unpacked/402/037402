15 cases of bovine rabies in Tianeti, and 7 human cases in whole of Georgia
-----------------------------------------------
The religious holiday Lasharoba, which is held annually in Tianeti on Tue
20 July, had to be cancelled this week because of an epidemic of rabies
among local cattle. 15 cows have died of rabies in Upper Tianeti during the
last 10 days. Inhabitants of the region told journalists that they cannot
remember such an epidemic before in upper Tianeti. In fact, it is the 1st
time that rabies virus has been discovered there.
Veterinarians who discovered the epidemic were quick to give vaccinations,
not only to the domestic animals, but to their owners as well. Consumption
of dairy products, such as cheese, butter, and milk have been banned until
the epidemic has been eliminated. [Although rabies virus has been
transmitted to experimental animals orally and by exposure to aerosols,
there is no evidence of transmission of rabies virus to humans by
consumption of dairy products from animals that are not clinically
affected. - Mods.JW/CP/TG]. There does seem some hope that the disease is
already on the wane. The Chair of the Veterinary Department of Georgia,
Levan Ramishvili, told The Messenger that the epidemic has already been
eliminated. "It was not discovered for 10 days, but now there is no threat
that it will spread any more," he said. "We have vaccinated all the
animals, and those which were ill with rabies have been buried or burnt."
According to Ramishvili, the main source of transmission of rabies is wild
animals or dogs. "The same problem exists in Tbilisi too," he said,
"because there are too many homeless dogs. Those organizations that are
responsible for solving the problem of homeless dogs have been unable to do
so. So, the Veterinary Department has decided to solve this problem
together with the City Welfare Service. We are going to work out a program
concerning this problem."
According to the head of the National Center for Disease Control, Dr. Paata
Imnadze, in 2004, there have already been 7 cases of rabies in human, all
of them fatal. He adds that, out of the 24 000 reported cases of human
contacts with animals in 2003, approximately 75 percent were dog bites.
Levan Ramishvili also told The Messenger that the Mayor of Tbilisi, Zurab
Chiaberashvili, promised to solve problem of rabies, and the Mayor's office
has allotted GEL 2 900 [USD 100] for this. "The vaccination campaign will
begin in September or October 2004 . Also, on 6 Aug 2004, we will hold a
program to vaccinate dogs, and we hope that discussion of this problem will
come to an end,'' concluded Ramishvili.
Back in Tianeti, residents are still worried, and, are continuing to
receive vaccinations. One resident of Tianeti, Keteven Tskrumishvili, told
journalists from Rustavi-2 and Imedi that people there have a very close
relationship with their cows and frequently come into contact with them, so
they had to have vaccination too. "We had 5 vaccinations, and later we have
to have one more as well. Since this epidemic was discovered, we have not
eaten any dairy product. We boil milk and give it to the dogs and pigs,"
said Tskrumelashvili.
Meanwhile, one family, with the surname Gilauri, has taken the brunt of the
epidemic. On the family farm, the epidemic is in its 2nd week, and 7 cows
have died so far. The Gilauri's believe that the cows were bitten by a wild
animal, and, that rabies has spread in this way, although local vets
believe that rats and domestic dogs may have spread the disease. If the
epidemic does not decline, the Gilauri's told reporters that they, along
with other inhabitants, will move to a safer place.
Rabies has not been discovered in lower Tianeti yet. But, as local
inhabitants told journalists, they are very afraid of the disease, and, for
this reason, very few people traveled to Upper Tianeti to celebrate the
Lasharoba holiday.

[It would be interesting to know the strain of rabies involved. If this
were occurring in South America, we might believe it to be a bat rabies
strain, generally coming from bats.
Vaccination of the pets is a wise move.
Rabies in cattle is remarkable, and, once seen, is not easy to forget. The
animals bellow with a sound that might more aptly be described as something
from a horror movie. It is no wonder the townspeople are quite scared.
The article is unclear whether these people are receiving post-exposure
prophylaxis (PEP), or, if they are receiving preventative treatment. If it
is PEP, then the number of injections seems very high. If it is a
preventative vaccine, it would be nice to know the origin, and, whether it
is duck embryo, human diploid, or rhesus strain. - Mod.TG]
