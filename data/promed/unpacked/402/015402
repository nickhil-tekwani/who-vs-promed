Permanent Secretary of Health Dr. Prakrom Vuthipongse has acknowledged that
Hong Kong tourists may have caught cholera while in Thailand. "Thailand is
not a cholera-free country," he said following a crisis meeting of
provincial health officials called in Bangkok. "I want to tell the people
of Hong Kong not to worry. By the end of the month, everything should be
under control." Prakom said the outbreak of acute diarrhea, which could
include some cholera cases, is the worst in 4 years. Of some 1400 persons
afflicted by the illness, 10 have died after the outbreak spread from
southern fishing ports in December.
An investigation to determine which of these cases were cholera is under way.
