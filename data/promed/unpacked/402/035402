Death of South African was caused by spotted fever
--------------------------------------------------
After investigations, researchers from the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation
(Fiocruz), together with the Ministry of Health and the Departments of
State and Municipal Health, identified the cause of death of the South
African patient of 53 years who died last Tuesday (2 Dec 2008) in Rio de
Janeiro, with a picture of unidentified haemorrhagic fever. The result of
research shows that death was caused by spotted fever, a disease
transmitted by ticks. There is no risk of transmission between people.

From data on the period of stay in South Africa and in Brazil and the time
required for the manifestation of symptoms, it was concluded that the
[infection] did not occur in Brazil. The patient came to Brazil from South
Africa, on 23 Nov 2008 at night and presented the 1st symptoms on 25 Nov
2008. [In the case of arenavirus infection] the clinical manifestations
appear after an incubation period on average of 7 days and can vary from a
minimum of 2 to a maximum of 15 days. "Because the symptoms appeared 2 days
after his arrival in Brazil and he only went from the airport to the hotel
and from there to work, there was not enough time or opportunity for him to
have been infected here," said Ary Carvalho de Mirandathe vice president of
Reference Services and Environment of Fiocruz.

The case of death of the South African [patient] mobilized a group of
experts who raised several lines of research. Epidemiological research,
which showed the absence of any link between this death and the cases of
[arenavirus] infection that occurred recently in South Africa, and the
diagnostic tests in the laboratory discarded the suspected infection by
this virus. The tests were completed in the end at the Fiocruz by Saturday
night [6 Dec 2008].

Suspected hantavirus, herpes, hepatitis, yellow fever, leptospirosis,
malaria, and dengue, among others, were excluded by laboratory testing. "It
was necessary to consider other possibilities, until we reached the [final]
diagnosis of spotted fever," says epidemiologist Eduardo Hage, the
Secretariat of Health Surveillance of the Ministry.

Since spotted fever is not transmitted through contact between humans,
starting this Sunday [7 Dec 2008] the Ministry of Health, the Departments
of State and Municipal Health suspended the clinical monitoring that was
being conducted involving 75 people, so far. There is no need for any other
measure to protect public health, related to this case.

A team at Fiocruz, led by researcher Elba Lemos, finalized the diagnosis of
spotted fever on the morning of Sunday [7 Dec 2008], through PCR
[polymerase chain reaction] analysis identifying the DNA of _Rickettsia_)
in the laboratory of Hantaviruses [and] Rickettsioses of IOC / Fiocruz
(National Reference Laboratory for Rickettsioses).

As the death was [attributed to] haemorrhagic fever and the patient [had
been present] in villages where certain diseases occur that are nonexistent
in Brazil, all [diagnostic procedures were undertaken] in laboratories of
biosafety level 3 (NB3) -- recommended procedure for the investigation of
unknown pathogens -- ensuring the containment of the agent and the safety
of professionals involved in the analysis.

[Spotted fever] is difficult to diagnose, especially in its initial phase,
since the symptoms are similar to those of other infectious febrile
diseases. The [onset] is generally sudden and usually the 1st symptoms are
nonspecific, including fever (usually high), headaches, muscle aches,
general malaise, nausea, and vomiting. Bleeding may occur during the
evolution of the disease. Researchers are carrying out a molecular
characterization to identify which species [or rickettsia] was responsible
for this death. The information will be communicated the Pan American
Health Organization (PAHO).

About spotted fever
-------------------
Spotted fever can be caused by bacteria of the genus _Rickettsia_. There
are over 20 species of rickettsia that can cause spotted fever. Spotted
fever is an acute febrile disease, which can cause asymptomatic to severe
forms of disease, with high case fatality rate. In Brazil and the United
States, the disease is caused by the [species] _Rickettsia rickettsii_.

The disease is transmitted to humans only by infected ticks. In Brazil, the
main reservoir of _Rickettsia rickettsii_ is the tick of the species
_Amblyomma cajennense_, known as [lone-star] tick. There is no risk of
person-to-person transmission. For infection to occur, the tick needs to be
attached to the skin for a few hours (4 to 6 hours). The transmission of
the pathogen can also occur by crushing the tick, if there are lesions on
the skin. The ticks are infected throughout their life, which usually lasts
18 months.

The clinical picture is marked by [abrupt] start, with high fever and
headache, and there may be intense muscle pain and prostration. During the
course of the disease, there may be bleeding, nausea, and vomiting. The
clinical manifestations appear after an average incubation period of 7 days
but it may vary from 2 to 15 days. The appearance of lesions on the skin
[hence the name 'spotted fever' - Mod.CP] increase the level of suspicion,
although there are cases where this signal can not be detected -- such as
in patients of African descent.

In Brazil, the 1st case was identified in 1929. From 1997 to 2008, 641
confirmed cases were recorded in the country. In 2007 and 2008, there were
136 cases, mostly in Santa Catarina, Sao Paulo, and Minas Gerais. In the
last 2 years, Rio de Janeiro registered 17 cases.

[Since the patient's illness is presumed now to have been contracted in
South Africa a different species of rickettsia to that prevalent in North
and South America may have been responsible for the infection.

A recent publication (Rifat Rashid, Alessandro C Pasqualotto, David W
Denning. A case of spotted fever rickettsiosis imported into the United
Kingdom and treated with ciprofloxacin. Journal of Medical Case Reports
2008; 2: 98 (<http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/2/1/98>) describes
a case of spotted fever rickettsiosis who presented in the United Kingdom
after visiting the Kruger National Park in South Africa.

This paper is a useful source of references concerning African spotted
fevers and the rickettsiae afflicting travellers in Africa and elsewhere in
recent times. In the introduction to their case report the authors state
the following:

"Rickettsiae are obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacteria causing
acute febrile, zoonotic diseases. Rickettsiosis is an endemic condition in
many areas of the world, and ticks have an important role amongst the
various arthropods acting as vectors. As each tick species has a preference
for particular environmental conditions, tick-borne diseases are habitually
restricted to specific geographic areas. African tick bite fever, caused by
_Rickettsia africae_, is probably the most commonly encountered agent of
rickettsiosis in travel medicine. This condition is endemic in large parts
of rural Africa but is rarely seen in the United Kingdom."

Further information is awaited regarding the species identification of the
agent responsible for the death of the South African patient in Brazil. -
