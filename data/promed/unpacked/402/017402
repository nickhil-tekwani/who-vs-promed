17 cases of hepatitis A were reported to Municipal Secretary of Health - Rio
de Janeiro City. The cases ocurried in students of a municipal school,
aged 10 to 14 years. All had onset between 1 & 20 June 1999. The symptoms
were nausea, vomiting, jaundice, fever.
The water supply system and food storage were examined and we didn't find
any
abnormality. In order to find the source of infection a special
questionnaire was developed.
Vaccine against hepatitis A isn't available through the National Program but
through a donation by the SmithKline Company it will be possible.

[Thank you, Cecilia, for this report. We wish more city & state
epidemiology services would report outbreaks to us -- we are particularly
interested in emerging disease reports - Mod.JW
