http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/263358/tahiti-chikungunya-claims-14-lives

[The number of cases in French Polynesia is increasing rapidly. The 14 Dec 2014 post (ProMED-mail archive no. 20141215.3033248] reported that there were 35 000 cases, and 3 weeks later the estimated case number is nearly 3 times that. In a 9 Jan 2015 report, health authorities estimate that now there are 60 000 cases in French Polynesia (http://www.tahiti-infos.com/Le-chikungunya-a-cause-l-hospitalisation-de-500-personnes-en-trois-mois_a118340.html in French], and on 16 Jan 2015, the estimated case number is 61 600 with 15 deaths. There is a decrease in the Leeward Islands and Tuamotu Gambier. On the Marquesas and the Austral islands, virus circulation seems to persist. The cumulative attack rate exceeded 20 per cent of the population in all except the Austral archipelagos. In the Tuamotu-Gambier, 36 of the 50 inhabited islands, for which information is available, have been affected. It is estimated that 50 per cent of people have been affected (http://polynesie.la1ere.fr/2015/01/16/chikungunya-61600-cas-15-deces-222438.html in French, trans. CopyEd.LM).
