Indonesian teenager dies of suspected bird flu in Java
------------------------------------------------------
A 15 year old Indonesian [girl from Semarang] is believed to have died from
suspected bird flu in Central Java on Friday [7 Nov 2008].

A total of 113 people have died of avian influenza or bird flu in
Indonesia, the worst affected country in the world. Agus Suryanto, a
medical official, said that [the girl] died from respiratory failure that
followed a high fever. "There was a chance that she got infected by bird
flu as she had been living nearby a chicken abattoir," Agus told
kompas.com. He said that the hospital had taken and diagnosed [?] a blood
sample from the patient but was still waiting for the results of the test.

The Ministry of Health of Indonesia in September [2008] retrospectively
announced 2 confirmed cases of human infection with the H5N1 avian
influenza virus. According to the UN World Health Organization, of the 138
cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 113 have been fatal. A total of 246
deaths have been recorded worldwide. [As of 10 Sep 2008 (the latest
report), WHO's table of the cumulative number of confirmed human cases of
avian influenza A/(H5N1) gives the number of deaths in Indonesia as 112 and
the number of cases as 137; see

[In an earlier report from Indonesia this case was confused with that of a
32 year old poultry worker who died on Monday 3 Nov 2008 of suspected avian
influenza. Laboratory analysis did not confirm the diagnosis of bird flu
infection in his case.

Apart from proximity to a poultry abattoir, there is no compelling reason
to indicate that the teenager has died as a result of avian influenza virus
infection. The results of laboratory tests are pending.

Semarang is located on the northern coast of Central Java and can be found
