The California Department of Food & Agriculture (CDFA) provided a status update on [29 Aug 2018] on the virulent Newcastle disease (VND) surveillance project in southern California, which is now in its 4th month.

CDFA said the disease has been detected at a total of 117 properties in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside and Ventura counties in California.

According to CDFA, as of [26 Aug 2018]:
- 96 880 properties have been surveyed;
- 2679 properties have been placed under quarantine;
- 397 properties have been released from quarantine;
- 671 (combined total) farmers markets, feed stores, pet stores, egg vendors and private veterinary practices were visited by VND outreach teams;
- Zero VND detections have been found at commercial poultry operations;
- 40 commercial operations in southern California are conducting surveillance testing, and
- 176 state and federal personnel are working on this incident.

As this project continues, bird owners everywhere, and especially in southern California, are urged to practice strict biosecurity measures. In southern California, CDFA said these measures include:

1. Do not move birds.
2. Do not bring new birds to the property.
3. Do not let people with birds come into contact with your birds.

VND mostly travels when infected poultry are transported or on the hands and feet of people that came into contact with infected poultry or their droppings, CDFA said.

CDFA has more information on its VND webpage.

[According to the CDFA website : https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/ahfss/Animal_Health/Newcastle_Disease_Info.html

"Virulent Newcastle disease (VND), formerly known as exotic Newcastle disease, is a serious, highly contagious viral disease that can affect poultry and other birds. In rare cases, humans that have exposure to infected birds may get eye inflammation or mild fever-like symptoms. These signs generally resolve without treatment, however, medical care should be sought if signs persist. Infection is easily prevented by using standard personal protective equipment. Virulent Newcastle disease is not a food safety concern. No human cases of Newcastle disease have ever occurred from eating poultry products. Properly cooked poultry products are safe to eat.

"The virus is found in respiratory discharges and feces and may cause high rates of sickness and death in susceptible birds. For poultry, chickens are most susceptible and ducks and geese are the least susceptible. Mortality rates for Psittacine birds (parrots) can range from zero up to 75 percent. Certain parrots, especially Amazon parrots, can shed VND virus intermittently in excess of one year. Other birds may be infected, but may not show any symptoms and may still be able to spread the disease. Once VND is introduced into domestic avian populations, subsequent spread is normally caused by domestic bird-to-bird contact or through contact with contaminated people, feed or equipment. Other types of Newcastle disease known as lentogenic and mesogenic are less virulent and may cause mild symptoms or none at all.

"There is no effective cure for virulent Newcastle disease. It is important that all commercial and non-commercial poultry owners maintain effective barriers to mitigate the risk of VND. Biosecurity tips for commercial poultry owners can be found at https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/ahfss/Animal_Health/BioSpecies/CommercialPoultryBiosecurity.html.

"For Backyard and non-commercial poultry owners, biosecurity tips can be found at https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/ahfss/Animal_Health/BioSpecies/BioPoultry.html."

All bird owners should look at the recommended biosecurity information on these pages. Biosecurity of your flock, regardless of size is hugely important to keeping your birds healthy. - Mod.TG
