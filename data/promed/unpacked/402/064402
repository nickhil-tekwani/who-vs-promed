New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Marion County, Marion, Florida
Date of start of the outbreak: 19 Aug 2018
Outbreak status: resolved on 28 Aug 2018
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 1 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: 6-year-old beef type cow.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 100 / 100 / 100 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive, spontaneous mutation

Epidemiological comments: as part of the United States' targeted surveillance program for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), a case of atypical BSE was identified in a 6-year-old beef type cow. This atypical BSE case was classified as H-type. In over 20 years of surveillance, the 5 native cases detected in the United States have all been atypical cases. The identified animal did not enter any food supply channels and at no time presented a risk to human health. Specified risk material removal and the ruminant-to-ruminant feed bans continue to be effectively applied.

Control measures
Measures applied: screening; traceability; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; modified stamping out; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) / 26 Aug 2018 / Positive
Cattle / Western blot / 26 Aug 2018 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[This cow was tested as part of the routine surveillance of cattle for BSE. Good surveillance programs for BSE will detect the disease. BSE is not contagious and exists in 2 types -- classical and atypical. Classical BSE is the form that occurred primarily in the United Kingdom, first reported in the late 1980's. The primary source of infection for classical BSE is feed contaminated with the infectious prion agent, such as meat-and-bone meal containing protein derived from rendered infected cattle. By contrast, atypical BSE often occurs in older cattle and appears to occur spontaneously in all cattle populations.

The OIE recognizes the United States as a country having negligible risk status for BSE. However, cases of atypical BSE do not impact the official BSE risk status of a country, and therefore, this latest detection will not change the negligible risk status of the United States.- Mod.CRD
