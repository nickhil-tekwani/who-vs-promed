[I apologize for the delay in getting this formal OIE report posted. We are recovering from when we had a lightning strike very near the house and confusion followed. But this report formally confirms the news reports posted earlier. The source of the infection afflicting this bull is still unknown. Anthrax is common in this region so there might have been an old anthrax grave. On the other hand thanks to their large size, bulls have a large black-body image to attract tabanid females that may have fed on a sick animal on another farm, maybe in another village, maybe over the border in Uzbekistan. - Mod.MHJ
