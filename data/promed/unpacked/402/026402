Lot feeders urged to be cautious regarding sorghum
---------------------------------------------------
The Australian Lot Feeders Association (ALFA) is urging lot feeders
to take additional precautions regarding the presence of synthetic
pyrethroid insecticide and ergot in sorghum used for animal feed.
ALFA Vice President, Jim Cudmore, stated that "The presence of
Rutherglen bug and the fungal disease ergot in this year's sorghum
crop has potential risks for cattle fed with contaminated grain. For
instance, the use of synthetic pyrethroid insecticide to control
Rutherglen bug in this year's sorghum crop increases the potential
for beef residue issues. Lot feeders should also be aware of the
presence of the fungal disease ergot in this year's sorghum crop."
"Research has shown that cattle fed with even small amounts of ergot
infected sorghum have marked reductions in feed intake and growth
rates. Consumption of ergot infected sorghum also increases the
internal temperature of cattle during digestion, thereby potentially
leading to cattle distress in periods of high heat load. While state
legislation stipulates maximum ergot tolerances of 0.3 percent in
sorghum, lot feeders are encouraged to use the National Agricultural
Commodities Marketing Association 'CSG-2' grain receival standard
which has a 0.1 percent threshold," Mr. Cudmore concluded.

[Sorghum ergot caused by the fungus _Claviceps africana_ was first
identified in Australia in 1996, and within 6 months had been found
in all sorghum-producing regions in Queensland and New South Wales.
This species is the main cause of sorghum ergot in Africa, Asia and
the Americas. Other locally confined pathogens causing similar
symptoms are _C. sorghi_ in India and _C. sorghicola_ in Japan.
The disease is readily identified by the honeydew oozing from the
flowers, which is not as sticky as that produced by aphids. It may
support secondary infections by grain mold fungi. The developing seed
is replaced by a fungal growth which eventually hardens to a
creamy-coloured sclerote (ergot). The ergots have been shown to be
toxic to cattle, pigs and chickens. Dry conditions favour ergot
formation, and the present drought in Australia may have contributed
to the problem reported above.
Ergot is an important disease of sorghum in many areas, with losses
of up to 80 percent reported. Economic losses are due to decreased
yield and quality of seed, toxicity and quarantine concerns, as well
as harvesting problems due to the honeydew. The fungus can be spread
via spores by wind and mechanical means, or via ergots with plant
material and soil. The ergots are extremely hard and durable
structures and remain viable for a long time. Disease management
includes the use of certified seed, cultural practices, resistant
cultivars and fungicide treatments of seed and planted fields.
Other toxin-producing species of the genus affect a number of cereal
crops. Ergot of rye (_C. purpurea_) produces a different range of
alkaloids which are extremely poisonous to both humans and livestock,
but also have pharmaceutical applications.
