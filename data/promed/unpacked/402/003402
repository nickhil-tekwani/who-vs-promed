Dutch authorities say they will slaughter poultry at a cluster of 3 farms after new cases of bird flu were found in the town of Kamperveen [Overijssel province], in the 3rd outbreak in the Netherlands this week.

A new infection was detected Friday morning (21 Nov 2014) at a chicken farm in Kamperveen, roughly 100 km [about 62 miles] away from the previous infections, the Economic Affairs Ministry said. During a check of nearby farms, one farm was found with birds showing signs of illness [according to Dutch press, a duck farm - Mod.AS].

At least 25 000 chickens and ducks are being slaughtered on the farms and the ministry said it has also ordered birds slaughtered at a 3rd [chicken] farm as a precaution, given its location within 1 km [about 0.6 mile] radius of the 1st 2.

The ministry said tests to determine the exact strain of the virus are being conducted. The earlier Dutch cases and another this week at a duck farm in England were confirmed as H5N8, which British officials said poses a very low public health risk.

The government has banned the transport of poultry and eggs nationwide.

Although damages have been limited so far, the chairman of the country's Poultry Farmers' Union said the outbreak in the new location is worrying, given there are 34 more poultry farms within a 10 km [about 6.2 mile] radius.

In 2003 a major outbreak of bird flu in the Netherlands caused an estimated 300 million euros [about USD 371 million] in damages.

[The Dutch authorities have officially submitted to the OIE follow-up report No. 1, dated 21 Nov 2014, with the confirmation of the 2nd HPAI H5N8 outbreak in the Netherlands (covered as suspected in archive no. 20141120.2977844). The affected population, on a farm in Ter Aar, South Holland province, is reportedly "layer hens and partly free range". The following statistics were included:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 43 000 / 100 / 100 / 42 900 / 0

For additional details and a map, please see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=16565.

Laboratory confirmation of the 3rd and 4th outbreaks, in Kamperveen (a small village in the Dutch province of Overijssel) is anticipated. In case confirmed as HPAI H5N8, this means that the virus is circulating in at least 3 provinces: Utrecht, South Holland and Overijssel. Poultry on commercial farms, and particularly on free range farms, are readily exposed to wild birds and their droppings.

The Belgian press has reported today (21 Nov 2014) about preventive measures by the authorities, particularly distribution of guidelines and call for alertness to poultry holders. - Mod.AS
