States of Micronesia [edited]

Sporadic cases of Zika continue to present at the Yap Memorial
Hospital and the Community Health Center sites. There was one new
probable case from on Yap Proper this week with onset of 15 Jul 2007.
A total of 2 new probable cases were also identified in travelers
from the neighboring islands. The total cases that presented to
health care are now 63 confirmed cases (by PCR and IgM analysis) and
73 probable cases.
The community survey of Yap Proper has been completed and data are
now being analyzed. It involved an environmental survey, entomologic
collection, and serosurvey. The success of the survey owes much to
the Wa'ab Community Health Center (WCHC). The WCHC utilizes health
workers from each area of Yap Proper. They provide outreach into
their own communities and were essential in getting the survey teams
into the villages. The survey also had vital technical support from
the CDC, FSM National Government, WHO and Institut Pasteur.
