Janes Pub Style Chicken Burgers and Pub Style Snacks Popcorn Chicken have been recalled because of possible _Salmonella_ contamination, as part of an investigation of an illness outbreak. The burgers carry a best before date of 12 May [2018] with UPC code 0 69299 12491 0 and the popcorn chicken 18 May [2018] with UPC code 0 69299 12542 9, with both in the 800-gram size. The frozen food products were sold at stores across Canada. The recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the store where they were purchased.

In its food recall warning, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] said the recall was triggered by findings during an investigation of a foodborne illness outbreak. It did not say if there were cases of illness directly related to these products.

The Public Health Agency of Canada is also involved in the investigation. In September 2017, the agency issued a notice it was investigating 13 cases of salmonellosis in eastern Canada, including Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. The Public Health Agency warned that salmonella is commonly found in raw chicken, and that all chicken should be fully cooked in order to make it safe to eat. The investigation is continuing, says the CFIA, and that could lead to more recalls.

[I have placed this posting in the ongoing thread but it is not entirely clear that the recalled product is a source of the outbreak of _S._ Enteritidis strain. More information would be appreciated. - Mod.LL
