The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) has
confirmed that approximately 100 white-tailed deer found dead in the
town of Clarkstown, Rockland County over the last 2 weeks were killed
by epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD).

EHD is a viral disease of white-tailed deer that is transmitted by the
biting midge in the family _Culicoides_. The EHD virus does not infect
humans, and humans are not at risk of being bitten by the infected
midge, also known as a no-see-um or punkie.

DEC wildlife biologists collected a sampling of deer carcasses in
Rockland county and submitted them to the Fish and Wildlife Health
Unit for necropsy. Tissue samples were then sent to the Animal Health
Diagnostic Center at Cornell University and the National Veterinary
Services Laboratory where the diagnosis of EHD was made.

The EHD virus was last confirmed in New York in 2007 in Albany and
Niagara Counties. EHD outbreaks are most common in the late summer and
early fall when the midges are abundant. The symptoms of EHD include
fever, small hemorrhages or bruises in the mouth and nose, swelling of
the head, neck, tongue and lips. A deer infected with EHD may appear
lame or dehydrated.

Frequently, infected deer will seek out water sources, and many
succumb near a water source. An infected deer may die within 1-3 days
after being bitten by the midge, or the disease may progress more
slowly over weeks or months. There is no treatment and no means of
prevention for EHD. The dead deer do not serve as a source of
infection for other animals.

EHD outbreaks do not have a significant impact on deer populations.
Generally, EHD outbreaks occur in a specific geographic area, and
about half of the EHD infected deer may die in an outbreak. In the
north, the 1st hard frost kills the midges that transmit the disease,
and the EHD outbreak ends.

Hunters should not handle or eat any deer that appears sick or acts
strangely. DEC will continue to monitor the situation. Sightings of
sick or dying deer should be reported to the nearest DEC regional
office or to an Environmental Conservation Officer. For more

[The article does not tell us what type of testing is being used to
confirm the virus, but it is likely PCR.

With this many deer found dead, despite the claim that the disease
does not affect populations, wildlife and hunting enthusiasts are
likely hoping for an early fall.

The vectors that transmit the disease die out when frost occurs. -
