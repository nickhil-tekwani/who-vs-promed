Provincial health officials have confirmed the province's 2nd on-farm case of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) virus on a hog production site in southeast Manitoba.

The Office of Manitoba's Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) has been advised that animals on this farm have shown no signs of PED.

The CVO will now identify other premises that have been in contact with the farm in question and investigate how the virus arrived. This case was identified by a CVO investigation related to a previously reported positive sample from a high-traffic site.

PED is a reportable disease in Manitoba, and producers are encouraged to remain vigilant and must report all cases to their veterinarian.

To date, 8 high-traffic or environmental sites have tested positive for PED including 2 cases where it is likely pigs contracted PED at high-traffic sites and not on-farm. High-traffic sites move or handle large numbers of pigs and include livestock assembly yards, federal and provincial abattoirs, truck-wash stations, and livestock trailers. As of today [9 May 2014], a total of 1187 samples were submitted for PED testing from 18 high-traffic sites.

Of note, PED is not a food safety issue, and it does not affect humans. However, it can be a severe and often fatal illness in newborn and young pigs. Older animals often have less serious symptoms and generally recover.

Producers who have questions about PED, biosecurity, and related issues should contact the Manitoba Pork Council at 1-888-893-7447 (toll-free) or online at http://www.manitobapork.com for their resources and expertise.

There are now 62 farm premises that have tested positive for PED across Canada, including 2 in Manitoba, one in Prince Edward Island, one in Quebec, and 58 in Ontario.
