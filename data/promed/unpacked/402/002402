After the spread of a harmful bacterium [multidrug-resistant _Acinetobacter baumannii_] in the Kiel University Hospital [Schleswig-Holstein state], 5 [patients have] died.

Whether each of the pre-existing conditions or the multidrug-resistant germs caused or contributed to the death, is an open question, said the head of the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein (UKSH) in Kiel, Prof Jens Scholz of the outbreak. Overall, more than 19 patients were infected with the pathogen.

Currently, _A. baumannii_ resistant to the 4 major classes of antibiotics, were detected in 14 other [the surviving ?] patients. The exact number of all previously infected was not disclosed. Scholz: "Given the shortness of the time, we cannot count." Also, he did not specify the age of those affected or their medical histories. The spokesperson for the UKSH, Oliver Grieve, had previously said the deceased patients were between 25 and 80 years old. In an initial communication, only about 12 patients were said to be infected.

The Kiel Health Department was informed of the [outbreak] on [23 Dec 2014], the report said... Baerbel Christiansen, the [infection control doctor] responsible assured the UKSH that [infection control] measures are being carried out correctly.

Nosocomial _Acinetobacter_ bacteria are so-called MRGN (multidrug-resistant Gram negative) pathogens. _Acinetobacter_ are found in water and soil, [and] are usually not dangerous for [healthy] people. But in immunocompromised people they can cause pneumonia, wound infections, and sepsis. If it is multidrug resistant, treatment is much more difficult, because only a few agents in general help against the infection.

[The following has been mostly extracted from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Acinetobacter - UK: (N Ireland) ICU, multidrug-resistance, RFI 20141127.2993271:

_Acinetobacter baumannii_ (AB), a Gram negative coccobacillus, has emerged as a significant multidrug-resistant (MDR) nosocomial pathogen. Infection due to multidrug-resistant _Acinetobacter_ strains, especially _A. baumannii_ (MDR-AB), in critically ill, hospitalized patients and the frequency of clonal nosocomial outbreaks due to these microorganisms has increased worldwide in the past several decades (1). MDR-AB have also been reported recently to cause infections after natural disasters (such as, earthquakes) (2), and in soldiers severely injured in the war in Iraq.

During nosocomial outbreaks, MDR-AB have been recovered from various sites in the patients' environment and can survive on environmental surfaces for long periods of time, including curtains, furniture, and hospital equipment. MDR-AB has been reported to spread most commonly on the hands of hospital personnel from the contaminated environment or from patients who are either infected or colonized with MDR-AB. In addition, airborne spread of MDR-AB has recently been described in a burn unit (3).

Some isolates are susceptible only to the polymyxins [such as colistin] and sulbactam (4), although resistance to these antibiotics has also been reported. Sulbactam is a beta-lactam that is most commonly used in combination with ampicillin to inhibit certain bacterial beta-lactamases that would otherwise break down ampicillin and thereby to allow ampicillin to kill the bacteria. Versus _Acinetobacter_, however, sulbactam itself exhibits antibacterial activity.

Attempts to reduce the frequency of nosocomial infections due to MDR-AB have involved restriction of antibiotic use and enhanced infection control interventions (1) that involve placement of patients colonized or infected with MDR-AB on contact precautions, cohorting, and in some circumstances, conducting point prevalence surveys to look for other cases of MDR-AB and active-surveillance testing of patients with epidemiologic links to persons from whom MDR-AB have been recovered (5,6).
