As a clinician at a University Medical School training program, I found the
article regarding body piercing and infection relevant and timely. I
understand Hakon Haaheim, M.Sc. comment regarding the trend toward
sensationalism with the article from the American Reporter, but I think the
moderators extremely adroit in including a brief posting regarding this
association of infection with body piercing. We have seen the "mundane"
infections associated with piercing (_Staphylococcus aureus_ breast
abscesses post-nipple piercing, female labial cellulitis post-piercing) as
well as more interesting pathogens (_Eikenella_, for example).
A literature search of infections associated with body piercings,
especially genital ones, is sparse. The finding that body piercing can be
associated with the transmission of blood-borne pathogens probably wouldn't
surprise anyone, but many clinicians wouldn't necessarily be on the lookout
for them, since their perception is usually that piercings are done in an
environment such as that described by Elayne Angel. This is certainly not
so, as many young people can't afford commercial piercing, or believe they
are as proficient as more skilled piercing artists. They may not use the
same equipment described by Angel, but use what they have available,
including electrical wire or other sharp household utensils, or use the
same degree of antisepsis before, during, or after the procedures. The
source of this original article may not be a scientific one, but the
subject matter is appropriate for this forum, in my opinion.
