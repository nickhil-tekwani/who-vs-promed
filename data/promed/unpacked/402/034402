Skin sores and infectious ulcers, which triggered high fever, have sent scores of Tripoli residents to hospitals in recent days, a medical source in the capital has told the Libya Herald.

The patients needed treatment after being bitten by sandflies, which [transmit] leishmaniasis, also known as Kala-Azar. The prevalence of these insects is being blamed on the spread of garbage across the city.

Leishmaniasis, a disease spread by the bite of sandfly, has 3 forms. The least serious produces painful skin sores, and the most serious "visceral" form is fatal if untreated. It can though, be tackled, almost always successfully, with compounds containing antimony. However these drugs can have bad side effects.

Caused by a parasite injected by the bite of bloodsucking sandflies, the disease every year infects nearly one million people worldwide, mostly in the Middle East and South America. The long-lasting skin sores sometimes produce disfigurement, which requires plastic surgery.

Although sandflies, usually smaller than mosquitoes, can pass through most protective netting, their bites can be prevented by wearing protective clothing.

The World Health Organisation has said that the best way to combat the sandflies and the parasite they carry is good public health and sanitation.

[Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis [CL] is endemic in Libya, with sporadic outbreaks. In 2006, over 7000 cases were recorded in 8 districts, with an outbreak of 3961 cases in Musrata, and the disease spread to non-endemic areas (el-Buni AA et al. (2000). "Cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya: a study of the Yafran area. East Mediterr Health J 2000;6:884-7).

In 2009, the prevalence of CL was 7.1 per 10 000 population. There is a vector control program that involves insecticide spraying, and regular rodent control is performed (Alvar J. et al. Leishmaniasis Worldwide and Global Estimates of Its Incidence. PLoS One. 2012; 7(5): e35671, supporting file S54).

The current outbreak is most probably due to a breakdown of control measures under the period of civil unrest since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi. - Mod.EP
