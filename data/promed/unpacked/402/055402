[1] MSF: plea to governments for people, not money

Medecins Sans Frontieres Australia (Doctors Without Borders) has today [17 Sep 2014] called on the Australian Government to go beyond pledging financial aid to fight EVD and immediately respond with a deployment of specialised civil and military capacity to affected countries in West Africa.

MSF cannot accept any donation of funds from the Australian government. We have been asking countries, including Australia, to evaluate their emergency medical and logistics capacity and make a contribution beyond financial support for over 2 weeks now and we continue to urge them to do so.

"While MSF welcomes the Australian Government's pledge of AUD 7 million [about USD 6.3 million] contribution to assist with the global response to this international health emergency, we have told the Government that donating to organisations such as MSF is not the best way for governments to meet the immediate needs. This money would be better spent providing capacity that MSF and other NGOs cannot supply," said Paul McPhun, Executive Director of MSF Australia. -- more

[3] Ebola virus disease: hiccups

[A long, fascinating and detailed 3-page report. - Corr.MM]

"What finally gave the virus away was, of all things, hiccups. On 14 Mar 2014, MSF's Geneva office received a report from a medical investigation in Guinea, [which it] immediately forwarded to Dr Michel Van Herp, an epidemiologist in its Brussels office, and one of the world's leading experts on EVD. When Van Herp opened the document, what immediately jumped out at him was that half the victims had developed hiccups. For reasons not entirely clear to the medical community, hiccups are associated with EVD. "It is definitely a hemorrhagic fever," Van Herp told a colleague in Geneva, who was consulting with him by phone. "But we must really take into consideration that it is worse than Lassa [fever]. I think it's Ebola." Van Herp notified MSF's Brussels headquarters, presented his suspicions, and then immediately began preparing to leave for Africa."

[4] USA: vaccine trial
Date: Tue 16 Sep 2014
Source: The Washington Post [edited]
http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/09/16/an-ebola-vaccine-was-given-to-10-volunteers-and-there-are-no-red-flags-yet


The 1st human trial of an EVD vaccine has so far produced no adverse effects, according to Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH's [National Institute of Health] Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The phase I trial is being conducted at an NIH facility in Bethesda, Maryland [USA] and is focused on building scientific evidence that the vaccine is safe in humans. It was developed by British drug-maker GlaxoSmithKline in conjunction with the NIH. The vaccine is based on a chimpanzee cold virus, chimp adenovirus type 3, which is being used as a carrier of pieces of genetic material of 2 Ebola strains: Sudan and Zaire; the latter is currently causing the massive epidemic in West Africa. The Ebola genetic material in the virus is not able to replicate and poses no harm to the people who receive it.

This process is just the 1st phase of a multi-step evaluation intended to show that the virus is safe, and that it works in humans. [NIH Director] Fauci said that this 1st phase of clinical trials for the vaccine is expected to finish by the end of November or early December [2014]. After that, they will launch expanded trials to further prove that the vaccine is safe. -- more

[In contrast, the British arm of the vaccine trial claims, "If the trials are successful, it could be used to immunise health workers in affected areas by the end of the year [2014]. By then, around 10 000 doses should be available." (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-29230157).

There is some disagreement about how soon the vaccine will be available. The sooner the better for the public, the hundreds of health care workers already on the ground plus the 3000 US troops.
