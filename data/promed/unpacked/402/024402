MONTHLY CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB DISEASE FIGURES
------------------------------------------
The position on variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (vCJD) -- the form of the
disease thought to be linked to BSE -- is as follows:
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK:
Year vCJD: probable, still alive/probable, dead*/confirmed/Total vCJD
1995 0 / 0 / 3 / 3
1996 0 / 0 /10 /10
1997 0 / 0 /10 /10
1998 0 / 0 /18 /18
1999 0 / 1 /13 /14
2000 7 / 3 / 9 /19 to 30 June 2000.
*post-mortem results pending
Total number of definite and probable cases of vCJD = 74, including 6
probable deaths from vCJD where neuropathological confirmation will never
be possible. [This is not clear; the Table only shows 4 "probable". - Mod. JW
The next table will be published on Monday 7 Aug 2000.
This table now includes the number of living patients known to be suffering
from 'probable' vCJD. This is because recently agreed criteria for
diagnosing vCJD in living sufferers has been confirmed by SEAC, the
scientific advisory body which advises the Government on CJD issues, as
being reliable enough to enable such information to be published. Further
details were set out in the Department of Health Press Release of 16 Mar
(ref R227 34).

[If most or all of the 10 probable cases so far in 2000 are confirmed, &
confirmed cases continue to appear at the same rate, we will see a steep
rise in the epidemic curve. We will know more when we see the figures at
the end of this year. - Mod. JW
