Whole of Wales to be made a bluetongue protection zone
------------------------------------------------------
The Welsh Assembly Government announced on 5 Aug
2008 that it intends to declare the whole of
Wales a bluetongue protection zone as opposed to
gradually rolling out the zone county by county.
It hopes this approach will enable vaccination to
take place across all of Wales within a matter of weeks.

It expects to be in a position to declare the
zone by the end of August or early September
[2008], but the move is dependent on the
availability of bluetongue vaccine and there
being no new outbreak of disease in the meantime.

The Chief Veterinary Officer for Wales, Dr.
Christianne Glossop, said: "We are entering the
period of highest risk of bluetongue and, as
midge populations become more active, the threat
of virus circulation increases. The decision to
designate the whole of Wales a protection zone
has been made following careful analysis of a
range of factors including veterinary risk and
economics, in consultation with our key industry stakeholders."

In England, the delivery of 2 million additional
doses of bluetongue vaccine by Merial has allowed
DEFRA to extend the bluetongue protection zone
into what was previously the bluetongue-free area.

The most recent expansion of the zone took place
on 7 Aug 2008, and details of the areas now
covered can be found on DEFRA's website at
http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/bluetongue/latest/index.htm>.
DEFRA is again encouraging farmers to vaccinate
their susceptible livestock at the earliest
possible opportunity. It also points out that
bluetongue has recently re-emerged in large parts
of France, and is urging farmers in the UK to be vigilant for the disease.

Investigating suspect bluetongue disease incidents
--------------------------------------------------
We wish to report the results of investigations
into 10 disease incidents in cattle in 2007 and
2008 that resulted in suspicion of bluetongue
disease on clinical grounds, but which
subsequently gave negative laboratory results. We
hope that doing so will alert veterinarians in
the field to the common differential diagnoses of
bluetongue in cattle in England [as well as
elsewhere in Europe. - Mod.AS] (which are
described by Williamson and others [2008]).

The criteria of the incidents that were investigated were:
1. Notification of clinical signs suspicious of
bluetongue in one or more bovine animals (by an
owner or a private veterinary surgeon).
2. Subsequent inability of a veterinary officer
of Animal Health to rule out bluetongue and
classification of the incident as a 'report case.'
3. Standard laboratory testing for bluetongue gave negative results.

The aim of the study was to determine whether
these disease incidents were due to a known
endemic disease or a potentially new or unrecognised disease.

Investigations were carried out by veterinary
investigation officers from the Veterinary
Laboratories Agency (VLA). A full description of
the investigations [carried out on 10 farms],
including photographs of the clinical signs, can be found at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/vla/diseases/docs/dis_bluetongue.pdf>
[Initially published 25 Jul 2008].

The most common cause of the signs that had
triggered a report case was photosensitisation,
followed by malignant catarrhal fever. It is
suggested that these and other diseases be
considered as differential diagnoses of
bluetongue, as highlighted by Williamson and
others (2008). [Differential diagnosis of
bluetongue in cattle and sheep. In Practice 30, 242-251].

In this small study, there was neither evidence
of differential diagnoses of bluetongue infection
giving rise to false-negative test results, nor
of a newly recognised disease causing clinical
signs similar to those of differential diagnoses of bluetongue.

We hope that this information will assist
colleagues who may be called upon to examine
cattle suspected of having differential diagnoses
of bluetongue. Suspect cases of differential
diagnoses of bluetongue must be notified to the
Animal Health divisional office. The VLA is able
to assist with the continued investigation and
diagnosis of suspect differential diagnoses of
bluetongue cases that subsequently test negative.

[3] Belgium: clinical BTV-8 in an Eurasian Lynx

Bluetongue in Eurasian lynx [letter]
------------------------------------
Bluetongue is an infectious disease of ruminants;
it is caused by bluetongue virus (BTV), mainly
affects sheep, and occurs when susceptible
animals are introduced to areas where BTV
circulates or when BTV is introduced to naive
ruminant populations. The natural host range is
strictly limited to ruminants, although
seroconversion without disease has been reported
in carnivores [Alexander KA., MacLachlan NJ, et
al. Evidence of natural bluetongue virus
infection among African carnivores. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 1994;51:568­76].

We report BTV infection, disease, and death in 2
Eurasian lynx (_Lynx lynx_) and the isolation of
BTV serotype 8 (BTV-8) from this carnivorous species.

The 2 Eurasian lynx, held in the same cage in a
zoo in Belgium, became lethargic in September
2007; animal 1 died after 2 days, and animal 2
died in February 2008. Both had been fed ruminant
fetuses and stillborns from surrounding farms in
an area where many bluetongue cases had been
confirmed. Necropsy findings for animal 1 were
anemia, subcutaneous hematomas, petechial
hemorrhages, and lung congestion with edema.
Necropsy findings for animal 2 were emaciation,
anemia, enlarged and gelatinous lymph nodes,
petechial hemorrhages, and pneumonia. For each
animal, microscopic examination showed edematous
vascular walls; enlarged endothelial cells; and
evidence of acute to subacute vasculitis in
muscle, myocardium, peritoneum, and lung. Tissue
samples (spleen, lung, intestine) were analyzed
by using 2 realtime reverse
transcriptase­quantitative PCR techniques
targeting BTV segment 5 and host Beta-actin mRNA
as a control. BTV RNA was found in all samples
from animal 1; cycle threshold values ranged from
28.6 to 36.2. Tissues from animal 2 were negative for BTV RNA.

Although the internal control was originally
designed to detect Beta-actin mRNA of bovine or
ovine species, clear positive signals were noted
in all lynx samples, which indicated that this
was a reliable control procedure. Infectious
virus was subsequently isolated from the lung
sample of animal 1 after inoculation of
embryonated chicken eggs and amplification in
baby hamster kidney­21 cell cultures. The
specificity of the cytopathic effect, observed 48
hours after passage on baby hamster kidney­21
cells, was confirmed by real-time reverse
transcriptase­quantitative PCR. Virus
neutralization using specific reference serum
proved that the isolated virus was BTV-8.
Anti-BTV antibodies were detected in lung tissue
fluid from animal 2 (ID Screen Bluetongue
Competition assay, ID VET, Monpellier, France).

We describe a natural, wild-type infection of a
carnivorous species. Although deaths have been
documented in dogs accidentally infected with a
BTV-contaminated vaccine [Evermann JF, McKeiman
AJ, et al. Canine facilities associated with the
use of a modified live vaccine administered
during late stages of pregnancy. J Vet Diagn
Invest. 1994;6:353­7] the 2 lynx in this report
were neither vaccinated nor medically treated by injection.

BTV-8 was 1st introduced to northern Europe in
2006 and has subsequently spread rapidly to many
countries on that continent. During 2007, a total
of 6870 bluetongue cases were reported in
Belgium; animal 1 died in September 2007, which
corresponded to the peak of bluetongue outbreaks
in that region. No deaths were reported during
that period among other animals, including
ruminants, held in the same zoo as the 2 lynx
reported here. The time lapse between initial
clinical signs and death could explain the
failure to detect BTV-8 RNA in animal 2. Although
speculative, the suspicion of bluetongue in this
animal is based on the presence of anti­BTV-8
antibodies, vasculitis, and pneumonia, which have
been found in dogs accidentally infected with BTV
[see the above ref on canines].

This report raises questions about the current
knowledge of the epidemiology of bluetongue.
Bluetongue in lynx indicates that the list of
known susceptible species must be widened, at
least for serotype 8. Although infection of a
susceptible host by an insect vector is the only
proven natural transmission mechanism for
wild-type BTV, transplacental transmission of
BTV-8, resulting in the birth of seropositive or
virus-positive calves, has recently been
described in cattle [see item 4]. Although
infection by an insect vector cannot be excluded,
transmission by the oral route must be strongly
suspected because the lynx described in this
report had been fed ruminant fetuses and
stillborn animals from surrounding farms. This
possibility is supported by a previous suspicion
that seroconversion to BTV in carnivores was a result of oral infection.

The possibility of oral transmission is also
supported by evidence of lateral transmission of
BTV infection to cattle having occurred, in the
absence of insect vectors, as a result of direct
contact with newborn viremic calves born to
infected dams that had been imported to Northern
Ireland from a bluetongue-infected region of
continental Europe (S. Kennedy, unpub. data). The
role of wildlife, especially carnivores, in the
epidemiology of bluetongue deserves further study
to elucidate their role as either dead-end hosts
or new sources of infection for livestock and to
help determine the risks for wildlife populations.

Our findings clearly indicate that a novel
transmission pathway enables the virus to cross
species. Consequently, transmission to other
species, including domestic animals, can no
longer be excluded. Moreover, oral transmission
is likely to have considerable implications for
disease control, including vaccination, because
BTV-8 is a fast-emerging virus with major financial consequences.

The above paper provides an intriguing
observation which raises questions, several of
which discussed by the authors. We may add 2
points for further discussion/study:
1. Could the described infectivity and
pathogenicity of BTV-8 to an unconventional
host-species be related to the hypothesis that
this strain may have been derived from a modified
live virus strain? - see also commentary to item 4.
2. It is plausible that a considerable number of
other felidae, namely domestic cats, have been
exposed to similar infective materials during the
epizootic. The possibility that some of them
underwent infection deserves to be investigated. - Mod.AS]

Transplacental Infection and Apparently
Immunotolerance Induced by a Wild-type Bluetongue
Virus Serotype 8 Natural Infection: Summary
-----------------------------------------------------
Until recently, bluetongue (BT) virus (BTV)
serotypes reportedly causing transplacental
infections were all ascribed to the use of modified live virus strains.

During the 2007 BT epidemic in Belgium, a
significant increase in the incidence of
abortions was reported. A study including 1348
foetuses, newborns and young animals with or
without suspicion of BTV infection, was conducted
to investigate the occurrence of natural
transplacental infection caused by wildtype BTV-8
and to check the immunocompetence of newborns.
BTV RNA was present in 41 percent and 18.5
percent of aborted foetuses from dams with or
without suspected BTV involvement during
pregnancy, respectively. The results of dam/calf
pairs sampled before colostrum uptake provide
evidence of almost 10 percent transplacental BTV
infection in newborns. Apparently immunotolerant
calves were found at a level of 2.4 percent. The
current study concludes that the combined
serological and real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) result of
pregnant dams gives no indication of the
infection status of the offspring except in the
case of a double negative result.

In a group of 109 calves with clinical suspicion
of BT, born during the vector-free period, 11
percent were found to be RT-qPCR positive. The
true prevalence was estimated to be 2.3 percent,
indicating the extent of transplacental infection
in a group of 733 calves of one to 4 months of
age without BT suspicion. Moreover, virus
isolation was successful for 2 newborn calves,
emphasizing the need for restricting trade to
BT-free regions of pregnant dams possibly
infected during gestation, even if they are BTV RT-qPCR negative.

[The discussion chapter of the above paper
includes the following concluding observations:

"The successful virus isolation from 2 calves
establishes the potential that calves could
introduce infectious BTV into regions where
suitable vectors are active. This emphasizes the
need for restricting the trade to disease-free
regions of dams possibly infected during
pregnancy, even with a BTV RT-qPCR negative
result. How long these calves remain infectious
will be the subject of further investigation but
based on the limited follow-up data it seems that
these calves are not persistently infected and
clear the virus in the same way as adult cattle during an epidemic.

"At present (May 2008) [still valid as of 9 Aug
2008. - Mod.AS] spread further northward of the
BTV serotypes present in southern Europe has not
been reported, except for BTV-1 that has reached
the south of France. Therefore, the results of
the current study examining in total 1348
foetuses, newborn and young animals with or
without suspicion of BT, prove that
transplacental infection via this wild-type BTV-8
strain circulating in North-Western Europe is not
a rare event. Hence, whether the newly developed
BTV-8 vaccines are able to protect against foetal
infection must be examined urgently given the
fact, for example, that the efficacy of
inactivated BVDV [Bovine Virus Diarrhea, caused
by a pestivirus known for its transplacental
infection. - Mod.AS] vaccines to prevent
congenital infection is limited. Furthermore,
research is needed to find out whether this BTV-8
strain may be derived from a modified live virus
strain" (see also commentary to item 3, BTV-8 in a lynx).

The large scale scope of the Belgian study
underline their significance. Reference to the
Belgian observations on transplacental
BTV-infection in cattle, initially presented
during the 31 Mar 2008 meeting of EU's Standing
Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health
(SCFCAH) in Brussels, was made in the commentary
to item 1 of posting 20080408.1294.
