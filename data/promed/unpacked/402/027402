Response to: Bluetongue - Europe (55): Spain (BTV-1, ovine), UK
(BTV-8) 20071109.3632
----------------------------------------------------------------------
We agree that the comments in Farmers weekly by Prof. Hugh Pennington
seem to indicate that _Culicoides imicola_ may be involved in BTV-8
transmission in the UK. We can assure you that this is not the case
and we have found no evidence that _C. imicola_ is present in the UK.

Bluetongue disease: update
--------------------------
A 3rd case of Bluetongue has been confirmed in Switzerland. The
cattle holding (100 animals, 1 case) is located in the Wahlen region
in the Kanton of Basel. As an additional case has been confirmed in
Germany, Rheinfelden, Baden, on the Swiss border, the existing
restriction zone has been extended covering an additional 12
municipalities in the Kanton of Aargau and adding 14 in the Kanton of Jura.

Bluetongue costs the Dutch Livestock sector about 81 Million Euro in 2007
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Dutch farmers union LTO has presented a report today estimating
the costs for the livestock industry in the Netherlands at
approximately 81 million Euros [USD 118,762,790] for 2007.

Sheep farmers are particularly negatively affected, followed by
cattle farmers. The disease is still spreading in the Netherlands; so
far 6160 holdings have been affected.

We are grateful to Susan Baekeland for collecting the data; some of
it has already changed (e.g., the 3rd case in Switzerland, [2] above).

Bluetongue will be back - warning
---------------------------------
Bluetongue disease is likely to return with a vengeance in East
Anglia next year, 2 top livestock farmers have warned after a
fact-finding trip to northern France.

"The midge-borne disease has hit farmers far worse this year when it
returned in August [2007]," said mid-Norfolk farmer Roger Long, who
has just returned from a visit to the Lille area close to the Belgian
border. "We must have a vaccine available as soon as possible and
certainly by late spring if a serious animal welfare problem is to be averted."

Mr Long, who is a regional member of the National Farmers' Union's
livestock board, said bluetongue has come back this year "with a
bang" to cause real problems for French livestock producers. "The
ones that were infected last year are getting it far worse this year
because the animals build up no immunity to it whatsoever."

The 5-strong NFU party, which included Suffolk farmers' leader John
Collen, was clearly surprised that cattle and sheep would be hit so
hard by the disease in the 2nd year. "I think we all thought that
animals would build up immunity once they had been bitten," he said.

Mr. Collen, who has 2 confirmed cases in his 300-cow dairy herd at
Gisleham, near Lowestoft, also has 24 cattle infected by the disease
since it arrived in Suffolk in early August [2007].

The group, which included East Anglian sheep producer, Andrew Foulds,
of Elveden, near Thetford, toured farms in an area about half the
size of Norfolk during the 3-day visit.

There have been about 7000 cases of bluetongue in France since August
last year [2006] while there have been just 62 in eastern England
since 22 Sep 2007. Mr. Long, of Scarning, near Dereham, said their
French hosts reported numerous cases of "abortion and premature
births in cattle and sheep and also loss of fertility in bulls and
rams. It was a sorry picture."

One dairy farmer with 46 milking cows and 15 suckler cows had brought
all his stock inside every night as a precaution but it had not
really helped, said Mr. Long. One French farmer told him: "There's no
stock management that can stop a midge."[See: re culicoides activity
indoors. - Mod. AS]

The French government pay to collect fallen stock, which encourages
farmers to report cases. Mr. Collen said that e43 (GBP 30) [USD
62.73] was paid for every dead lamb and pro-rata for ewes and cattle.

"We were also told that light-coloured cattle are more susceptible,
possibly because the midges can target these animals," said Mr. Long.

"Vaccination is the only way forward and the sooner the better. It
has got to happen. We must have it before the end of April or early
May for cattle turnout time."

Defra's chief vet, Debby Reynolds, 55, has taken early retirement
after 4 years, it was announced yesterday.

[It would be helpful to obtain information on the above data
regarding "lack of immunity." Are repeated cases seen in animals
affected in the previous year, or rather in unaffected, probably
young susceptible animals? In BTV enzootic countries, repeated cases
may indicate the possible involvement of a heterologous serotype. - Mod. AS]
