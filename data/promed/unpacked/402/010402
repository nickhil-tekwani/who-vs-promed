Epizootic hemorrhagic disease shouldn't spoil
firearm deer season. Michigan's Department of
Natural Resources and Environment (DNRE) has
confirmed epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) in
white-tailed deer in Ottawa County, with the
number of deer killed from the disease possibly
reaching more than 500 in Ottawa and 3 other counties.

Still, DNRE wildlife biologist Tom Cooley says
the disease shouldn't be overly concerning to
hunters, and that with the recent rash of cold
weather across the area, we're unlikely to see
any further cases of EHD this fall and winter.
EHD, Colley explained, is passed to deer by a
small biting insect called a midge [Culicoides sp
or no-see-um ­ Mod.TG]. It cannot be passed from
one deer to another, and poses no direct threat to humans.

Midges cannot survive freezing temperatures, so
with hard frosts occurring across Ottawa County
at least a few mornings the past 2 weeks, it's
highly unlikely any of these insects survived.
And since the disease acts so quickly, any deer
that had previously been infected will have
recovered from the disease or perished.

Cooley said the DNR tracked EHD outbreaks in 1955
and 1974, then again in 2006. In a somewhat
concerning trend, there have now been EHD
outbreaks in 4 of the last 5 years in Michigan.
Typically, between 50-100 animals die of the
disease in a given year. Last year, 150 known
cases were identified, but many more were
suspected, leading to an estimate of up to 450 deer perishing from EHD.

"This year, with the 4 counties (Ottawa, Berrien,
Cass and Allegan) involved, that's more
widespread than we've had in the past, so this
will probably be the highest mortality we've
had," Cooley said. "In the states to the south of
us, they have cases of it pretty much annually.
Nobody really knows for sure why we're seeing it
so often now when we went so many years between
it. If you want to believe in global warming,
some people do and some people don't, but that's
certainly a possibility. Or maybe it's limited
rainfall pushing deer down into areas to keep
cool where the midge, and the virus, are. Nobody really has a solid answer."

Cooley said there are very few outward signs of
EHD in deer. On the other hand, another
hemorrhagic disease, called blue tongue disease,
can cause facial distortions that are clearly visible.

"EHD is a close relative of bluetongue disease,
but we have not had bluetongue disease in
wildlife in our state," he said. [Although EHD
and BTV are closely related viruses, they are not
the same. EHD can spill over into domestic
livestock, but it seems more rare for BTV to
spill into wildlife, although it can happen. ­
Mod.TG] A more telling sign that a deer has died
from EHD would be its proximity to a water
source. EHD causes a high fever, so infected
animals often head toward water in an attempt to cool down.

DNRE conservation officer Ivan Perez, who works
in Ottawa County, said common sense can often
help people identify the cause of death in a
deer. "If you see a dead deer on the side of the
road, there's a good chance it's a road kill. If
you see one near water, there's a good chance
it's EHD," Perez said. "You can call a wildlife
manager, or call our RAP hotline, because it
could very easily be a misidentified deer that
was killed by a rifle or some other means that
they didn't see. It may be worth investigating
for illegal matters," Perez said.

Cooley said that a hunter field-dressing a deer
with EHD would notice edema -- the collection of
fluid between the skin and the muscle. Excessive
hemorrhaging could also be a sign of EHD. Perez
encouraged hunters to bring their deer to a DNRE
check station if they have any concerns.

Cooley recommended hunters and others interested
visit <http://www.michigan.gov/wdm> to visit the
wildlife disease management site. Both Perez and
Cooley said the presence of EHD in Ottawa County
deer should in no way dissuade hunters from taking the field.

"There's no reason not to hunt," Cooley said.
"What you may see is some isolated areas where
there's some impact on the deer population, but
that's going to be very short-lived. By next
year, the numbers will probably be back up. It doesn't take them long."

[The mode of transmission of EHD in nature is via
a _Culicoides_ biting fly or gnat. _Culicoides
variipennis_ is the most commonly incriminated
vector in North America. A common observation in
outbreaks involving large numbers of deer (as in
Michigan) is that they are single epizootics that
do not recur. Die-offs involving small numbers of
deer (as experienced in South Dakota and
Nebraska) occur almost annually, and the disease
appears to be enzootic in these areas. All
documented outbreaks of EHD have occurred during
late summer and early fall (August-October) and
have ceased abruptly with the onset of frost.

Clinical signs of EHD and bluetongue are similar.
White-tailed deer develop signs of illness about
7 days after exposure. A consistent
characteristic of the disease is its sudden
onset. Deer initially lose their appetite and
fear of man, grow progressively weaker, often
salivate excessively, develop rapid pulse and
respiration, and finally become unconscious.
Hemorrhage and lack of oxygen in the blood result
in a blue appearance of the oral mucosa, hence
the name "bluetongue." Between 8 and 36 hours
following the onset of observable signs, deer
pass into a shock-like state, become prostrate, and die.
