Foot & mouth disease in Israel - OIE follow-up report 1
-------------------------------------------------------
Date of report [submission to the OIE]: 25 May 2017
Date of start of the event: 1 May 2017
Causal Agent: Foot and mouth disease virus
Date of confirmation of the event: 8 May 2017
Serotype(s): A
Location: Qela, Golan, HaZafon
Start date [current, 2nd outbreak]: 22 May 2017
Clinical signs: yes

Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 68 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: vaccinated herd. Free ranging cattle. 50 dams and 18 calves. Mouth lesions have been observed in one of the dams. no limping was observed.

Epidemiology
Epidemiological comments: the virus of the outbreak in Arab el Aramshe [immediate notification, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=23732] is an A strain from the Genetic lineage A/ASIA/G-VII(G-18). In the outbreak of Qela [current event], the strain is A and the lineage is still pending.
Last time that A strain was diagnosed in Israel was in 2009 [see comment].

Measures applied: movement control inside the country; vaccination in response to the outbreak; screening; quarantine; zoning

Diagnostic test results
Name of laboratory: National Foot and Mouth Disease Laboratory, Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan.
Species / Test type / Date / results
Cattle / real-time PCR / 23 May 2017 / Positive

FMD has a seasonal pattern in Israel, with May being, during most recorded events, the peak month.

Most FMD outbreaks, throughout the years, were caused by FMDV serotype O. Typically, this serotype affected both large and small ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats) and spread widely among unvaccinated animals. FMDV serotype A outbreaks were reported in the years 1965, 1971, 1979, 1981, and 2009. While the outbreak in 1965, caused by FMDV serotype A22 which spread at that time throughout the Middle East, affected all parts of the country and all susceptible species, the events in 1979 and 1981 were limited to cattle, affecting grazing beef-type cattle, and were limited to the north-east (Golan heights, bordering Lebanon and Syria). The 2009 event, caused by FMDV-A topotype ASIA, genotype 'Iran-05BAR-08', affected cattle and sheep and spread throughout northern Israel. It was found identical to strains from Libya, Iran, and Iraq.

According to initial genotyping of the virus isolated from the 1st outbreak (Aramshe) of the current evolving event, the strain involved was genotyped by the national laboratory as lineage A/ASIA/G-VII(G18). Confirmation from WRLFMD and genotyping results of the current case in Qela (likely, identical) are pending. This virus is, most probably, currently circulating in Lebanon and probably also in Syria/other countries in the region.

A recent FMD event involving several locations in the Palestinian authority (West Bank) is yet to be serotyped and, hopefully, genotyped (see archive no. 20170516.5039513).

For the above and additional information on FMD in Israel, please refer to Israel's page on the WRLFMD website, at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/isr.htm.
