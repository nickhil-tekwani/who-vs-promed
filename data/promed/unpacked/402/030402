A life-threatening fungal illness is rapidly spreading throughout central California, health officials say. The number of valley fever [coccidioidomycosis] cases rose 8 percent in 2018 from the previous year [2017], up to more than 8100 from more than 7500, according to a report released by the California Department of Public Health last week. The increase from 2016, when cases totaled around 5700, was even more shocking, a sharp spike of 42 percent.

Kern County, which is about 133 miles from Los Angeles, was hit the hardest by far, documenting a little more than 3000 cases, up 23 percent from 2017 and 48 percent from 2016. Nine deaths were recorded in the county in 2017, which is the highest number in more than a decade, reported SFGATE.

Counties that also saw a high number of cases include Los Angeles (1036), Fresno (632), Tulare (425), and San Luis Obispo (353). "We've seen a lot more cases recently," Michelle Rivera, a health education specialist for Fresno County, told SFGATE. "Not all providers are testing for it, so there might be more cases out there."

Health officials suspect a few reasons for the rise in cases including rainfall affecting the way the fungus grows and spreads, more people moving to high-risk areas, and an increased level of detecting and diagnosing the illness.

Valley fever, also known as coccidioidomycosis, is an infection caused by a fungus found in soil. The fungus, called _Coccidioides_, flourishes in areas that are hot and dry, making California's climate the perfect area for outbreaks. Valley fever is contracted by breathing in spores in the air and cannot be spread from person to person. Symptoms appear one to 3 weeks later and include a rash, fatigue, headache, fever, shortness of breath, coughing and muscle or joint pain. Because the symptoms resemble other illnesses, getting a correct diagnosis can be delayed. The illness generally goes away on its own after a few weeks or months without treatment, but some people may be given anti-fungal medication to reduce symptom severity. In a few cases, the infection can spread from the lungs to the brain, bones, skin or eyes, causing blindness, skin abscesses, lung failure and occasionally death.

Approximately 10 000 cases are reported in the US annually, mainly in Arizona and California, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Last week, a US appeals court threw out a lawsuit from California prison inmates and ruled that the inmates cannot hold state officials liable for contracting valley fever. Ian Wallach, an attorney for some of the inmates, said the ruling was devastating. "The families of over 40 inmates who died and 100 who got infected and require lifetime medical care are left to fend for themselves," he told The Associated Press.

[Coccidioidomycosis, commonly known as valley fever, is a fungal disease caused by inhalation of spores of _Coccidioides immitis_ or _C. posadasii_, dimorphic saprophytic fungi that grow in soil as a mycelium that break off into airborne spores. The spores, known as arthroconidia, become airborne during conditions that disturb the soil. In the host organism, the inhaled arthrospores develop into spherules, which produce as many as 800 endospores; endospores, when released into tissues, can mature into new spherules.

Most patients who become infected following exposure are asymptomatic but have immunological evidence of coccidioidomycosis. Within some endemic communities in the central valley of California, nearly the entire population has serological evidence of prior infection. Infection generally imparts immunity to reinfection.

Risk factors for more severe pulmonary disease include diabetes, recent history of cigarette smoking, income of less than USD 15 000 per year, and older age (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11229838). Disseminated infection occurs more frequently in certain ethnic groups (persons of African, Filipino, and, to a lesser extent, Hispanic descent), pregnancy, and immunodeficiency, such as that due to AIDS or immunosuppressive drugs.

Reasons for increased cases of coccidioidomycosis are not fully understood. The increase can in part be attributed to increased reporting practices, climatic change (heavy rainfall followed by drought, increasing temperatures, and dust storms in the southwestern United States) (http://www.demos.org/publication/economic-and-environmental-impacts-climate-change-arizona), soil disturbance caused by increased construction activity, growing numbers of persons who are immunocompromised or have other risk factors for severe disease, and movement of previously unexposed persons from areas where coccidioidomycosis is not endemic to endemic areas (for example, the prisoners mentioned in the news report above) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5805a1.htm).
