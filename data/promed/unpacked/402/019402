NSW is experiencing an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis with almost 500 cases
notified since 1 December 1997. In South Eastern Sydney, over 80 cases have
been reported to date, compared with only 8 for the whole of 1997. The
majority of cases have been children, with 51% of all cases aged 0-4 years,
and a further 18% aged 5-9 years. Seventy-four percent of all cases
reported swimming in a public swimming pool during the incubation period,
whilst 62% of under-5s have attended child care or preschool.
Cryptosporidiosis has been laboratory-notifiable in NSW since 1 December
1996. However, monitoring of cryptosporidiosis since 1989 has demonstrated
a cyclical pattern of summer peak occurring every few years. A peak occurred
in 1991 and the following peak in the summer of 1995 coincided with an
outbreak traced to a public indoor swimming pool in Southern Sydney where
74 individuals became ill. During the current outbreak, the Public Health
Unit is following up all cases by contacting the referring doctor, in order
to obtain clinical details and to gain permission to question the patient
about risk factors. A case-control study has just commenced and cases aged
<16 years and with a specimen date on or after 1 March 1998 will be included.
Recommendations made include:
- the diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis should be considered in patients with
watery diarrhoea during the current epidemic
- most pathology laboratories will perform microscopic examination for
cryptosporidial oocysts from faeces when this is specifically requested
- immunocompromised patients should be warned to take care when swimming so
as to minimise the chance of ingesting water
- person-to-person spread (between child-care, sexual and household
contacts) remains the major route of acquisition and good personal hygiene
is the key to prevention"
