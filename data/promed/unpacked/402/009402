The Directorate of Health says it has had to deal with a virtual explosion of diarrhea cases caused by _Campylobacter_, a bacterium spread mostly by the poor handling of meat.

In a statement posted on the Directorate's website, about 100 cases of _Campylobacter_-caused diarrhea have been reported over the past year. The afflicted come from many different backgrounds, making it difficult to find the cause of the outbreak.

The most common species of the bacterium, _Campylobacter jejuni_, is often connected to poultry, as the bacterium lives in the digestive tracts of many different bird species, and poorly handled raw chicken is a primary cause of the pathogen's spread.

The Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST) said that they could not definitively draw a connection between Icelandic chickens and the outbreak, nor could they rule it out. They pointed out that according to their findings, the incidence of campylobacteriosis in chickens has not significantly spiked upwards.

The Directorate of Health cautions the public to cook all meat thoroughly and to keep surfaces and hands clean during and after cooking, as well as to use clean water.

While the infection caused by campylobacteriosis is painful and debilitating, it is the most common form of gastroenteritis in the world, and is almost never fatal. High fever and diarrhea can last anywhere from 24 hours to a week before running its course, although antimicrobials can help bring an end to the infection.

[_Campylobacter jejuni_ has generally been considered to be a commensal organism in the chicken which is the single largest source of the organism. However, in some breeds of commercial broiler chickens, the organism can have an effect causing diarrhea and subsequent morbidity. This is documented in a recent paper from the UK, published in mBio:

Humphrey S, Chaloner G, Kemmett K, et al: _Campylobacter jejuni_ Is not merely a commensal in commercial broiler chickens and affects bird welfare. MBio. 2014 Jul 1; 5(4). pii: e01364-14. doi: 10.1128/mBio.01364-14; http://mbio.asm.org/content/5/4/e01364-14

Abstract
--------
_Campylobacter jejuni_ is the leading cause of bacterial food-borne infection; chicken meat is its main source. _C. jejuni_ is considered commensal in chickens based on experimental models unrepresentative of commercial production. Here we show that the paradigm of _Campylobacter_ commensalism in the chicken is flawed. Through experimental infection of 4 commercial breeds of broiler chickens, we show that breed has a significant effect on _C. jejuni_ infection and the immune response of the animals, although these factors have limited impact on the number of bacteria in chicken ceca. All breeds mounted an innate immune response. In some breeds, this response declined when interleukin-10 was expressed, consistent with regulation of the intestinal inflammatory response, and these birds remained healthy. In another breed, there was a prolonged inflammatory response, evidence of damage to gut mucosa, and diarrhea. We show that bird type has a major impact on infection biology of _C. jejuni_. In some breeds, infection leads to disease, and the bacterium cannot be considered a harmless commensal. These findings have implications for the welfare of chickens in commercial production where _C. jejuni_ infection is a persistent problem.

Importance
----------
_Campylobacter jejuni_ is the most common cause of foodborne bacterial diarrheal disease in the developed world. Chicken is the most common source of infection. _C. jejuni_ infection of chickens had previously not been considered to cause disease, and it was thought that _C. jejuni_ was part of the normal microbiota of birds. In this work, we show that modern rapidly growing chicken breeds used in intensive production systems have a strong inflammatory response to _C. jejuni_ infection that can lead to diarrhea, which, in turn, leads to damage to the feet and legs on the birds due to standing on wet litter. The response and level of disease varied between breeds and is related to regulation of the inflammatory immune response. These findings challenge the paradigm that _C. jejuni_ is a harmless commensal of chickens and that _C. jejuni_ infection may have substantial impact on animal health and welfare in intensive poultry production. - Mod.LL
