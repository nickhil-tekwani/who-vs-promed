A mosquito-borne disease has directly or indirectly killed 77 people
on France's Indian Ocean island of La Reunion, French Health Minister
Xavier Bertrand said on Thursday.
Chikungunya fever, for which there is no known cure or vaccine, had
affected some 130 000 people [an incidence rate of 16.8 per cent] on
the island off the southeast coast of Africa. Bertrand said that was
20 000 more than a week ago.
Around one in 6 inhabitants has now been affected on Reunion, which
has a total population of some 775 000 people.
"The last numbers ... refer to 77 deaths, directly or indirectly
attributable to the epidemic for the month of January 2006," Bertrand
said. "(This is) a radically new situation, which was not expected
because scientific research showed that chikungunya did not kill," he
said.
The illness, which has also travelled to the nearby Indian Ocean islands of
the Seychelles and Mauritius [and Mayotte. - Mod.JW], is marked by high fever
and severe [joint pains and]rashes. Most people recover although it is
extremely painful.
First recognized in East Africa in 1952, it also leaves the immune
system weak, [providing] opportunities for other diseases to set in.
The name chikungunya comes from the Swahili for stooped walk,
referring to the posture of those afflicted.
French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, who is to travel to
Reunion on Sunday, said the entire island should be ridden of
mosquitoes to stop the disease from spreading.
Villepin said it was still safe to visit the island, which is a
popular tourist destination for European travellers. The Reunion
Committee on Tourism has reported tour cancellations but has not
provided figures for costs incurred.
"You can certainly go there. The proof is that I'm going there,"
Villepin told Canal Plus television. "You have to take some
precautions and use (certain) products," he said.
Authorities say people should remove stagnant water, use mosquito
repellents and bed nets and spray bedrooms at night.

A team of 4 experts from the World Health Organization has left for
the Indian Ocean island of Reunion to investigate a massive outbreak
of a debilitating mosquito-borne disease which causes its victims to
double over.
The largest-ever epidemic of the chikungunya virus among people in
Reunion started in February 2005, but has gathered pace since
December 2005, spreading to neighbouring countries.
Reports and estimates suggest that 110 000 of the island's 800 000 population
has been afflicted by the stooping disease, says WHO, although official
figures, from a voluntary sentinel system on the island, suggest just 1700
cases. During the first week of February 2006, Mauritius reported 206 cases
and the Seychelles reported 1255 cases. [110 000 is an estimate, based on
extrapolating the number detected by the sentinel physicians to the entire
population. - Mod.JW]
The WHO experts will assess the current actions being taken to fight
the chikungunya virus's spread, which include educating people about
how to protect themselves against the disease and bolstering
epidemiological surveillance.
People infected by the virus can also experience recurring episodes
of pain, even after the virus appears to have cleared from their
bodies, says Robert Tesh, an expert on mosquito-borne viruses at the
University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, USA. He says that
these returning arthritic pains may be caused by an immune system
response.
Tesh explains that no quick treatment exists for chikungunya disease. Doctors
primarily help to alleviate the symptoms, such as fever and
dehydration. "There isn't much else you can do," he says, adding that
he knows of no approved vaccine against the virus.
Chikungunya is typically found in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical regions of
Asia as far away as Indonesia. As for why such a large outbreak would occur in
the southwest Indian Ocean, Tesh says that this may have something to do
with "herd immunity". This describes the phenomenon in which populations
infected by the virus recover and gain immunity against it. When there are
enough people in one location who boast immunity to chikungunya, the virus
cannot easily pass from one host to another and cause an outbreak. Conversely,
if there has been no outbreak for a long time, herd immunity falls as fewer
people have encountered the disease before, allowing the virus to spread more
effectively.
"Weather can also play a role as it affects the abundance and
activity of the mosquitoes that transmit the virus," Tesh adds. Wet
conditions, for example, can cause an upsurge in mosquito populations.

[A safe and highly immunogenic live vaccine has been evaluated
through phase II clinical trial since 2000. So far no further study,
such as phase III multi-center clinical trial, has been documented.
