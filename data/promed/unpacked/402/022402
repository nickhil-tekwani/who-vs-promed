Thailand to cull wild storks to end bird flu
---------------------------------------------
Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra yesterday ordered the culling of wild
storks which he said were responsible for 2 fresh bird flu outbreaks in the
kingdom.
"These latest outbreaks of bird flu were caused by storks which are very
difficult to eradicate, but I have ordered the Natural Resources and
Environment Ministry to quickly cull all storks," he told reporters.
The culling of the birds, which he said were suspected carriers of the flu,
was to begin immediately, he added.
This week Thai officials confirmed 2 outbreaks of bird flu at a poultry
farm in Ayutthaya province and in home-grown chickens in Pathum Thai
province, both in central Thailand, but insisted that the outbreaks were
under control.
Thaksin conceded that environmentalists were likely to protest against the
move to eradicate the birds, but he stressed that public health took
precedence over wildlife as the country moved to contain the potentially
deadly virus.

[Culling wild birds to control avian influenza is an extreme,
highly controversial and most probably ineffective measure. See in
"Wildlife Management", FAO/OIE's Animal Health Special Report - Technical
Consultations, posting 20040318.0750, stating: "Wild birds should not be
depopulated in an attempt to control avian influenza but separation, as
much as possible, should be attempted". See further in [2]. - Mod. AS].

Thailand Confirms More Bird Flu Cases
-------------------------------------
Thailand confirmed more outbreaks of deadly bird flu among chickens and
wild ducks in provinces near Bangkok Tuesday.
"The H5N1 bird flu virus was found in wild ducks which live near Bangkok in
Phathum Thani province," Agriculture Minister Somsak Thepsuthin told reporters.
"We are worried because wild ducks move freely all over the place, hence
the virus could easily spread to more areas."
The virus has been found in the past few days on a chicken farm in
north-central Nakhon Sawan province, farms in Phathum Thani province, north
of Bangkok and on several farms in the northern provinces of Uttaradit and
Sukothai.
Last week, outbreaks of the H5N1 bird flu virus were confirmed in 2 central
provinces, ending Thai hopes that the avian flu outbreak which ravaged
poultry farms across Asia earlier this year had been eradicated.
Early this year, the H5N1 virus killed 24 people -- 16 in Vietnam and 8 in
Thailand -- who had come into close contact with infected fowl.
Thailand, then the world's 4th biggest chicken exporter, said it culled
around 60 million chickens and other poultry in that outbreak.
China said last week it had culled thousands of chickens and vaccinated
many more to try to halt an outbreak of H5N1.
There have been no reports of anyone in China or Thailand falling ill from
bird flu in the latest outbreaks and late last week, Chinese doctors
released 37 people from observation after they had come into contact with
infected chickens.
Migrating wild birds, especially waterfowl, were widely blamed for
spreading the epidemic across much of Asia and forcing widespread culling.
Yukol Limlaemthong, head of the Thai Agriculture Ministry's Livestock
Department, told reporters he feared more outbreaks.
"There are still some more provinces that we suspect have bird flu because
chickens in those areas have died with the symptoms we saw from the bird
flu virus. We have sent samples for lab testing," Yukol said.
Those provinces, such as Khon Kaen, are in northeast Thailand, Yukol said.
"Our assumption is that the bird flu virus is still on the ground. It might
take years to get rid of it," he said.
Officials have yet to reveal the number of fowl culled in the latest
outbreaks, but at least 30 000 have been killed.
The government also said Tuesday it would not cull wild storks, as it had
said it would, even though officials believe they carry the virus.
"It is not an effective way to contain the bird flu virus," Deputy Prime
Minister Chaturon Chaisang told reporters.
Yukol also said officials had tracked down 5000 chickens moved illegally
from a farm in Nakhon Sawan province where bird flu had been confirmed.
"Those chickens have been found cut in pieces and ready for further
processing for export in one processing factory in Saraburi province," he said.
"We have ordered the factory to stop operations for 7 days and destroy
(stocks)," Yukol said.

Bird flu confirmed in 7 provinces
-----------------------------------------------------
The government yesterday confirmed a fresh outbreak of bird flu in 7
provinces as dozens of chicken deaths in Bangkok raised concerns that the
virus may have reached the capital.
Ayutthaya, Pathum Thani, Suphan Buri, Angthong, Nakhon Sawan, Uttaradit and
Sukhothai all have new H5N1 bird-flu infections, Deputy Prime Minister
Chaturon Chaisang said.
"But we have taken relevant actions to control the situation", he said.
According to Chaturon, chickens in outbreak hotspots were being culled and
their owners would be compensated within 2 weeks.
The deputy PM seemed confident authorities would be able to tackle this
latest outbreak due to their extensive experience battling the disease
earlier this year. He added that this new round of infections was small in
scope.
Meanwhile, Bangkok livestock chief Padung Sutecha said he had received
reports of suspicious chicken deaths in Bangkok districts Thawee Watthana
and Don Muang, and the border area between Min Buri and Khlong Sam districts.
"We have collected samples and sent them to the lab. We should know the
results within 8 days",he said.
He added that the number of dead chickens numbered only in the dozens,
while other birds remained healthy.
Livestock Development Department director-general Yukol Limlamthong said
relevant authorities were monitoring several other provinces where new
suspected bird-flu infections had been reported.
"We are waiting for lab tests, and I don't think all the cases will
necessarily be bird flu", he said.
When asked about a farmer who smuggled 2000 of his chickens from Nakhon
Sawan, Agriculture and Cooperatives Minister Somsak Thepsuthin said
officials had managed to trace the offender and cull his fowl.
"We also filed a complaint with police against this farmer", Somsak added.
Yukol said relevant officials had the duty to report any suspected bird-flu
cases to provincial governors and public-health chiefs, and relevant
central agencies within 24 hours of detection.
Any farm where more than 10 per cent of fowls die mysteriously would
warrant attention and culling.
"The culling and the ban of fowl movements must be enforced if fowls appear
to be infected with avian influenza",he said.
Despite Yukol's insistence that Thailand does not require a bird-flu
vaccine to deal with this current outbreak, he admitted his department
planned to seek a Bt60 to Bt70-million budget [approximately $1.5 to $1.7
million USD] for the establishment of a vaccine-development laboratory.
"We have to prepare a long-term solution", he said.
The director-general believes the development of a vaccine will take a few
years.
Yukol confirmed that blood tests from chickens across the country would be
implemented late this month to determine which farms were infected with the
virus and which farmers had broken the law by injecting fowls with the vaccine.
"We will carry out the culling at farms where the infections are detected",
he said.
He added that provincial livestock officials nationwide would today attend
a meeting in Bangkok for a refreshment seminar on how to efficiently
prevent the spread of the disease.
In Hanoi, Bui Quang Anh, director of Vietnam's agriculture ministry's
animal health department, said poultry samples from the south of the
country had detected the virus but officials had the disease - which killed
16 people in Vietnam earlier this year - under control.
"Test results from random samples showed the fowls were infected with the
H5N1 strain of avian influenza", the director said. "The virus was leftover
from the previous outbreak because of our incomplete treatment of infected
farms".
Anh told Reuters that the H5N1 finding came 3 days ago and about 10 000
poultry - mostly chickens - in Mekong Delta provinces had been culled.
Vietnamese officials said last month that preliminary tests found only the
weaker H5 strain of the virus.

Vietnam confirms return of bird flu
-------------------------------------
Vietnam confirmed Tuesday that fresh outbreaks of bird flu were caused by
the lethal strain of the disease that killed 16 people in the country
earlier this year.
Agriculture ministry spokesperson Bui Quang Anh said tests carried out by
experts from the southern regional veterinary department in Ho Chi Minh
City had revealed the presence of the H5N1 virus.
"Vietnamese experts have discovered H5N1 in samples taken from poultry in
affected areas," he told AFP.
The state-run Sai Gon Giai Phong newspaper reported Tuesday [13 Jul 2004]
that bird flu outbreaks have occurred in 14 districts in 7 southern
provinces and cities since mid-April [2004].
A total of 22 470 chickens, 169 ducks, and 13 000 quails have either died
or been destroyed, the daily said. Anh refused to confirm the figures.
Last week the government was forced to defend its much criticised 30 Mar
2004 declaration that the country was free of bird flu.
"I think the announcement was correct and based on legal foundations. The
recurrence of any outbreaks may have occurred for a variety of reasons,"
foreign ministry spokesperson Le Dung told reporters.
"As you may know bird flu has appeared in several countries in Asia,
including China, Thailand, and Vietnam," he added.
The 30 March declaration, which came just 15 days after the disease claimed
its 16th fatality, prompted criticism from international experts that Hanoi
was acting prematurely and recklessly.
The World Health Organisation warned that it could take months, probably
years to eliminate the H5N1 virus from the environment.
International experts also criticised the government for its lack of
cooperation in tackling the disease and charged it with being more
concerned at putting its poultry industry back on a sound footing.
More than 44 million poultry died or were slaughtered across Vietnam as a
result of the bird flu, which was detected in 57 of its 64 provinces during
the major outbreak earlier this year.
Meanwhile, the Sai Gon Giai Phong said that since the beginning of July
[2004]authorities in the northern province of Lang Son, which borders
China, have confiscated and destroyed more than 2 tonnes of poultry [live
animals? carcasses?] smuggled into the country.

[The unfolding renewed epizootic in East-Asia is a cause for great concern.
Since the attempt to eradicate the disease by stamping-out has not proven
to achieve the expected eradication of the disease from the poultry
industry in some of the affected countries, reverting to vaccination in
such countries deserves to be reconsidered. The north-Italian experience
might serve as an example. Illegal use of uncertified, probably smuggled
vaccines of which the safety and efficacy are -- at best -- unknown, is not
only a breach of law but may play a role in the spread of the disease. -
