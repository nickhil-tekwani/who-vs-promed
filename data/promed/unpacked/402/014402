Botulism and hot-smoked whitefish: a family cluster of type E
botulism in France, September 2009
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: LA King, T Niskanen, M Junnikkala, E Moilanen, et al]

A family cluster of 3 cases of type E botulism was identified in
southeast France in September 2009. The suspected food source of
infection was a vacuum-packed hot-smoked whitefish of Canadian origin
purchased by the family during a visit to Finland and consumed
several weeks later in France on the day prior to symptom onset. No
leftover fish was available to confirm this hypothesis. Vacuum packed
hot-smoked whitefish has previously been associated with cases of
type E botulism in multiple countries, including Finland, Germany,
the USA, and Israel.

Case notification
-----------------
A confirmed case of type E botulism in an individual residing in
southeast France was reported to the French National Institute for
Public Health Surveillance (Institut de Veille Sanitaire) by the
National Reference Center (NRC) for Anaerobic Bacteria and Botulism
at the Pasteur Institute in Paris on 10 Sep 2009. 2 other members of
the same family were reported as having clinical symptoms compatible
with botulism. An investigation was undertaken to identify additional
cases, the vehicle of transmission, and to put in place appropriate
control measures.

Methods
-------
Following notification of the cases, active case finding was carried
out via contact with local health authorities, the NRC and the
hospital services where cases were hospitalized. Hospital clinicians
treating the patients, and thus likely to see other such cases, were
reminded by telephone contact to immediately report all clinical
suspicions of botulism to the local health authorities using the
routine mandatory notification system for the disease.

Serum samples from the cases were analysed by the NRC. The presence
of botulinum neurotoxin was confirmed by intraperitoneal
administration of patient serum to mice, and the toxin type was
ascertained by neutralization with specific antibodies (1).

The food history of the cases in the 3 to 4 days before onset of
symptoms was documented by the local health authorities, as were the
details of purchase, transport, and consumption of the suspected food
product. Based on patients' food history a fish product purchased
during a family visit to Finland was suspected to have been the
source of infection. A sample originating from the same batch of raw
fish as the implicated product but processed one day later was
collected from a local supermarket in Finland. The sample was sent to
the Department of Food and Environmental Hygiene, University of
Helsinki, Finland, for analysis of _Clostridium botulinum_ by
multiplex PCR targeted to the types A, B, E, and F neurotoxin genes (2).

Results
-------
The 3 cases (adults aged 52 and 46 years and an adolescent child aged
13 years) presented with classical clinical symptoms of botulism
(gastrointestinal symptoms followed by descending paralysis) on 7 Sep
2009 and were hospitalized the following day. One of the adult cases
rapidly developed quadriplegia and required intubation and mechanical
ventilation for 17 days. The other patients presented with a milder
form of the disease, did not develop paralysis of limbs or
respiratory muscles, and were released from hospital in mid-September
2009. The severe case remained hospitalized as of 29 Sep 2009 (latest
information available) but had regained motor function and begun to walk.

The NRC confirmed a diagnosis of type E botulism for the severe case.
Botulinum toxin type E was identified in a serum sample (8 Mouse
Lethal Dose (MLD)/mL) and in from 2 of 3 gastric juice samples (less
than 20 MLD/mL). Serum samples from the 2 milder cases were negative
for botulinum toxin. A fecal sample obtained from the child was
negative for botulinum toxin and _C. botulinum_. No other botulism
case associated with this episode was identified.

The food investigation carried out with the family identified the
consumption of vacuum-packed hot-smoked whitefish (_Coregonus
lavaretus_) on 6 Sep 2009 (the day prior to symptom onset). All 3
sick members of the family reported having eaten the smoked fish and
a 4th non-sick family member did not consume the product. There was
no leftover fish to test for the presence of toxin. The family did
not report consumption of any other foods usually associated with the
risk for botulism (home-canned vegetables or home-prepared meat
products such as ham, sausages, and pate) in the days preceding symptom onset.

The whitefish was purchased by the family in a supermarket in a
village in east Finland on 22 Aug 2009. The fish was smoked in
Finland but was originally from Canada. It was refrigerated after
purchase. The family returned to France the following day. The fish
was placed in a cooling bag with ice-packs for the duration of the
14-hour journey and then refrigerated upon arrival in the family home
until the day of consumption on 6 Sep 2009, 2 days before the expiry date.

The fish was not heated prior to consumption. The entire product
(800-1000 g) was eaten at the meal by the 3 patients. The adult with
a severe form of the disease reportedly consumed a greater portion of
the fish than the 2 milder cases.

An environmental investigation was carried out in the premises of the
fishery production plant by the food control authority in Finland.
The inspection focused on the fish processing and storage
temperatures, hygiene conditions and efficacy of in-house control of
the producer. The storage temperature of the raw material,
temperatures during the process, and transport were found to be
correct and in accordance with the in-house control plan and legislation.

The raw fish was imported from Canada 2 months earlier and stored
frozen at the premises' freezer (-18 deg C/-0.4 deg F). The
processing of the batch was started on 16 Aug 2009 with thawing and
salting of the fish (temperature below 3 deg C/37.4 deg F). After hot
smoking (2 hours; maximum temperature 68 deg C/154.4 deg F) the fish
was rapidly chilled (until 0.5 deg C/32.9 deg F), vacuum-packed and
stored below 3 deg C/37.4 deg F. The batch (about 600 kg) [approx
1300 lb] was transported at 0 deg C/32 deg F to the retail on 18 Aug
2009. The fish sample representing the same batch of raw material but
processed 1 day later than the implicated fish product was negative
for _C. botulinum_ in the PCR analysis. Temperature controls carried
out at the supermarket of purchase by the local food control
authority showed storage temperatures for fishery products of 0.8-2.8
deg C (33.4-37 deg F).

Public health measures
----------------------
European countries were informed of the event via the 'Early Warning
and Response System' (EWRS) and an alert in the 'Rapid Alert System
for Food and Feed' (RASFF), both issued on 11 Sep 2009. The
information in the RASFF was subsequently transmitted to the Canadian
food safety authorities. No other cases of botulism associated with
this product were identified in Finland, France, or other European
Member States, as of 9 Nov 2009.

Discussion and conclusion
-------------------------
_C. botulinum_ type E is an aquatic bacterium endemic in areas such
as Canada and Alaska (3-5). Type E botulism is characteristically
associated with the consumption of improperly prepared foods of
aquatic origin, either fresh water or marine (6). Cases of type E
botulism are very rare in France with the last episode declared in
2003 (7). Foods associated with the occurrence of this form of
botulism in France include salted herring, grey mullet, canned carp,
and canned sardines (8).

The negative mouse bioassay results of the serum samples of the 2
patients with a milder form of the disease could be explained by a
lack of circulating toxin in the patients' blood. It is known that
botulinum toxin cannot be detected in serum once it becomes
irreversibly bound to its cell receptors and thus the detection of
toxin in serum samples is believed to depend on the timeliness of
sample collection and on the ingested dose of toxin, among other factors (6,9).

The epidemiological investigations support the hypothesis of the
vacuum-packed hot-smoked whitefish as the source of contamination of
the 3 cases. No leftover fish was available for testing to confirm
this hypothesis. An association between hot-smoked whitefish and type
E botulism has been previously documented in Finland, Germany, the
USA, and Israel (10-13). On 2 previous occasions, cases of type E
botulism have been associated with whitefish imported from Canada and
processed in Finland, as was the situation with the whitefish
consumed by the 3 French cases (10,11).

Vacuum-packed hot-smoked fish is a known risk food for type E
botulism (14). It is believed that the hot-smoking processes carried
out on this type of fish, which typically reach temperatures of 60-80
deg C/140-176 deg F, are often insufficient to eliminate _C.
botulinum_ spores (15). Among factors believed necessary for
controlling growth and toxin production in this fish is the
continuous storage of the fishery products below 3 deg C/37.4 deg F
(10,11), information, which is clearly labeled on this food product.
According to the national legislation, modified atmosphere package
(MAP) and vacuum-packed fishery products must be stored below 3 deg
C/37.4 deg F in production and at retail in Finland. Temperature
controls carried out at the fishery production plant and the
supermarket of purchase showed that storage temperatures were in
accordance with the legislation. It is probable that the whitefish
consumed by the 3 French cases was not stored below 3 deg C/37.4 deg
F for the duration of the 14-hour return journey to France. Also,
French domestic fridges are estimated to have an average temperature
of 6.6 deg C/43.9 deg F] (16) and thus well above 3 deg C/37.4 deg F

Assuming that the temperature of the family's refrigerator
corresponds approximately to the estimated national average (the
actual temperature was not measured) the 2 weeks of refrigerated
storage could have allowed ample time for growth and toxin production
in the anaerobic environment created by vacuum packaging.

The absence of additional cases in Finland could be explained by a
limited contamination of the whitefish by _C. botulinum_. The fish
sample representing the implicated batch of raw material was negative
for _C. botulinum_ spores. In a previous case of human infection
reported in Finland, 10 fish samples from an implicated batch were
also negative for _C. botulinum_ (11). This is consistent with a
previous prevalence study showing that 18 percent of raw and 5
percent of processed and packaged whitefish carry type E spores (14).
The absence of further cases may also be explained by a difference in
storage habits of hot-smoked whitefish between the Finnish population
and foreign tourists.

This family cluster provides further evidence of the risk of type E
botulism associated with consumption of vacuum-packed hot-smoked
whitefish. This episode also highlights the potential public health
threat of _C. botulinum_ spores in incorrectly stored processed food
products and underlines the importance of clear labelling of storage
conditions for products purchased in the refrigerated sections of supermarkets.

[Type E botulism is, as stated, the type frequently associated with
fish products (1). Classically, botulism is a food-borne disease
caused by the ingestion of preformed toxin, although there also
exists wound botulism (in which _Clostridium botulinum_ spores
germinate in a wound), and infant botulism (in which the spores
germinate in the intestinal tract).

Types A, B, and E of human botulism are the commonest. Although each
type has a similar symptom complex, Hughes and colleagues report that
type E is much more likely to produce initial lethargic mental status
and more autonomic dysfunction (2).
