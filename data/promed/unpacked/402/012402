The first leishmaniasis call to public in Egypt
-----------------------------------------------
Today, all Egyptian mass media announced the emergence of a new cutaneous leishmaniasis case in Serobion district, Faiad, Ismailia governorate. However, this is not the first time to identify _Leishmania_ infection in Egypt, and approximately 25 cases occurs monthly in the Sinai peninsula, but today is the first time that Egyptian mass media consider leishmaniasis to the public.

Leishmaniasis disease burden was low across much of the country in the twentieth century; in the past decade, however, changing land use and natural disasters have placed several parts of the region at risk. As a consequence, this important disease has become a particularly difficult health problem. Today, Egypt raises the condition of emergence against leishmanasis spread.

The case identified suffers from the characteristic cutaneous leishmaniasis in different parts of the face region (nose, under the left eye, and between the eyes). The wet lesion is the predominant characteristic of the lesions; so, the culprit parasite may be _L. major_.

[Leishmaniasis is endemic in Mediterranean countries including Egypt. In a study of 150 patients with cutaneous lesions, 15.9% were diagnosed with leishmaniasis (El-Khalawany M et al. Clinicopathological features and the practice of diagnosing infectious cutaneous granulomas in Egypt. Int J Infect Dis. 2011;15:e620-6.). The Sinai peninsula is a well know focus in Egypt, and both _Leishmania major_ and _L. tropica_ have been found (Shehata MG et al. First report of _Leishmania tropica_ from a classical focus of _L. major_ in North-Sinai, Egypt. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2009;81:213-8).
