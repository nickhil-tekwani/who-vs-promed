Four thousand people infected by tuberculosis died in Kazakhstan last year
[2000. According to International Health Organization (IHO) standards, if
50/100 000 are ill with tuberculosis, it is [a cause for alarm: the
country is facing an epidemic.
In the province of Kazakhstan, expert evaluations [suggest that there are
152 ill with tuberculosis per 100 000 people. In Almaty, which medical
experts is consider [to be the city [with the lowest incidence, there are
69 ill with tuberculosis per 100 000 people.
The director of the Kazakh Tuberculosis National Center, Galymzhan
Rakyshev, considers that there are enough means allocated for medicines.
The whole problem is in the low [economic status and [lack of information
among Kazakh people.

[The incidence of 152/100 000 reported here is [considerably higher than
the 122/100 000 reported for Kazkhstan for 1998 (see ProMED-mail reference
above). Information about local control strategies and the incidence of
multiple drug resistant tuberculosis in Kazkhstan would be of interest. -
