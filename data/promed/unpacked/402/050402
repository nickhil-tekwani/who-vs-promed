Rift Valley fever in South Africa - update 2
--------------------------------------------
On Tue 11 May 2010 the Bernhard-Nocht-Institute for Tropical Medicine
in Germany reported that additional laboratory analyses conducted both
in Germany and South Africa on the German tourist who was
preliminarily diagnosed with Rift Valley fever (RVF) following her
return from South Africa, was in-fact infected with _Rickettsia_ and
not with RVF virus [see ProMED-mail Rift Valley fever - South Africa
(17): tourist, NOT 20100511.1537].

_Rickettsia_, commonly known as [a cause of] tick fever is a bacterium
which can cause many diseases that are transmitted by blood-sucking
parasitic arthropods such as fleas, lice, and ticks. Symptoms of
rickettsial infections include rash, fever, and flu like symptoms.
African tick bite fever is caused by _Rickettsia africae_ and tends to
be a milder illness, with less prominent rash and little tendency to
progress to complicated disease. All rickettsial diseases respond to
treatment with antibiotics such as doxycycline and tetracycline.

As of 10 May [2010], the Government of South Africa has reported 186
confirmed cases of RVF in humans, including 18 deaths, in Free State
Province, Eastern Cape Province, Northern Cape Province, Western Cape,
and North West Province. RVF is a viral disease that primarily affects
animals (such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and camels). The
disease can also affect humans. The main mode of transmission of RVF
is via direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected
animals. Human infections have also resulted from the bites of
infected mosquitoes. There is evidence that humans may become infected
by ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals.

WHO advises no international travel restriction to or from South
Africa. However, WHO recommends that visitors to South Africa,
especially those intending to visit farms and/or game reserves, avoid
coming into contact with animal tissues or blood, avoid drinking
unpasteurized or uncooked milk or eating raw meat.

All travelers should take appropriate precautions against bites from
mosquitoes and other blood-sucking insects (including the use of
insect repellents, wearing long-sleeved shirts and trousers, and
sleeping under mosquito nets). Travel medicine professionals and
travel medicine services should be aware of the current RVF situation
in South Africa in order to provide advice and care accordingly.
