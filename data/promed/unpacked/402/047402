The results of a Western Cape government investigation into an, "...alarming spike in seal deaths", along the province's coast is expected this week [8-14 Nov 2021].

Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC [Member of the Executive Council] Anton Bredell said the State Veterinary service is expected to issue a report, following tests on the dead seals.

The province has seen an increase in seal deaths, with nearly 200 seals buried in one day. Experts have speculated that the deaths could be a result of malnutrition, but they have ruled out any connection with an avian flu outbreak in the province.

Conservation group Sea Search estimates that thousands of Cape fur seals have died.

Bredell said his department is aware of the dying seals that have been washing up along the coast.

"The experts say that some deaths amongst seal populations at this time of the year can be expected. However, what we are seeing is an abnormally high number of animals sick and dying on the coastline. We are committed to finding out why and the State Veterinary service is already conducting tests on dead seals to determine the cause of these deaths. This report is expected this week."

Several partners and NGOs are, "... working tirelessly on the problem", said Bredell. Among them is the Sea Search Team, whom the public is urged to contact on seasearchseals@gmail.com if they find a dead seal along the shoreline.

"Please send a picture, location, and date. The Sea Search team is collating records to further their understanding of the current die off," Bredell adds.

According to a social media post by the Sea Search Team, hundreds of animals died over the weekend [6-7 Nov 2021].

"We are doing what we can but it is not enough to really understand the cause of the seal die off currently. We need to do more pathology testing at the vet lab which is pricey, we need to travel north to see what's happening there and we need more time to collate all the records sent to us by valuable and concerned members of the public," the post said.

The organisation has also asked for donations to support its response to the deaths over the last 2 months.

"What we are seeing is an abnormally high number of animals sick and dying on the coastline -- and we are committed to finding out why," the organisation said.

[Previous mass mortalities of seals, but in the North Atlantic, have been caused by influenza A viruses. In the past (1979-1983), influenza A virus was isolated from seals died from pneumonia in New England. Another pathogen known to cause seal die-offs is a morbillivirus, phocine distemper virus (PDV). PDV was first recognized in 1988 following a massive epidemic in harbor and grey seals in north-western Europe.

The scenario described resembles other wildlife die-off episodes where there seems to be no single culprit, but instead a multifactorial web of causation. When the stress-host-parasite equilibrium is broken, the tolerance and resistance to pathogens/parasites are reduced and hosts become increasingly deteriorated. Both exposure to transmissible diseases and host susceptibility to infection increase, resulting in a vicious circle (for a review on the subject see https://bibliotecavirtual.unl.edu.ar/publicaciones/index.php/FAVEveterinaria/article/view/5160/8492). - Mod.PMB
