Doctors airlifted to help sick Afghan children
----------------------------------------------
A group of Afghan and UN doctors flew into central Afghanistan to offer
help after 25 children died of whooping cough [pertussis - Mod.LL],
government and USA military officials said.
The 10 doctors, equipped with antimicrobial agents for 2000 people and
vaccinations for 2500, were taken by a USA military helicopter to the Gizab
district of Daykundi province, some 300 kilometers (188 miles) south of Kabul.
All roads to the district in Afghanistan's remote central highlands have
been blocked by heavy snow, and reports of the deaths reached the capital
last week.
"25 children died of whooping cough in Gizab in the course of the past
week," Afghan health minister Sayed Mohammed Amin Fatemi said on Sun, 23
Jan 2005.
USA military spokesman Major Mark McCann said they flew down the team from
the Afghan health ministry and the WHO in a USA-led coalition aircraft.
Pertussis is a highly contagious disease that can cause weeks of severe
coughing. Every year it kills more than 300 000 children around the world,
according to WHO figures, but patients can be treated with antimicrobial
agents.
Afghanistan's child mortality rate is one of the world's highest, the WHO
says. More than 250 out of 1000 children die before the age of 5 in
Afghanistan, while in France it is 5 out of 1000.
There were outbreaks of whooping cough, measles and some other epidemic
diseases in northeastern and southern provinces of Afghanistan in 2004 and
2003.

[The scope of this outbreak is not clear. Most pertussis-associated deaths
are in quite young, unimmunized children who are in contact with older
children or young adults with milder illness. Pertussis mortality can be
minimized not only by immunization with trivalent vaccine against tetanus,
diphtheria, and pertussis, but also by early antimicrobial intervention.
Large populations of susceptible people in the developing world is the
cause of large outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. - Mod.LL]
