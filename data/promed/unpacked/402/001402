Avian influenza situation in Egypt - WHO update 58
--------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health and Population of Egypt has notified the WHO of
2 cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus.

The 2 cases are a mother and her young child from Dakahlia
Governorate. Both developed symptoms on 26 Nov 2011. The mother was
admitted to a hospital on 1 Dec 2011 and received oseltamivir
treatment on admission. The child was hospitalised on 2 Dec 2011 and
also received oseltamivir on admission. The mother was 24 weeks
pregnant. She died on 3 Dec 2011. The child is in stable condition.

Investigations into the source of infection indicate that both cases
had exposure to sick and dead backyard poultry (chicken and turkeys).

The case was confirmed by the Egyptian Central Public Health
Laboratories, a National Influenza Centre of the WHO Global Influenza
Surveillance Network, on 3 Dec 2011.

Of the 155 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 53 have been fatal.
