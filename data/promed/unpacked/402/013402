Another cow dies of anthrax
---------------------------
A 2nd cow has died as a result of an outbreak of anthrax in
Victoria's Goulburn Valley. The Department of Primary Industries says
the animal died on Friday [4 Sep 2009], 4 days after the 1st reported
death. Cattle in the area are being vaccinated.

The department's acting senior vet, Dr John Ryan, says the 2nd cow to
die was on its way to a knackery. "It disrupted a knackery in that
they then had to go through a large amount of decontamination," he
said. "They had a truck which was out of their use for a couple of
days and basically we had to burn 7 carcases rather than just the
one, which raises the issue that we do need people to keep vigilant
as far as sudden deaths on their property."

He says disease experts have been called for assistance. "It's a
matter of having a look at to what was going on at the 2 different
sites to see what was similar, what was different, can something be
picked up which may give an indicator of why it occurs at some stages
and not others," he said. "[That] may be able to give us an early
warning system to alert farmers of the need to take action to prevent
it in the future."

There is little to add to John Ryan's useful comments. Once an
anthrax case has been diagnosed in an area any and all unexpected
deaths should be checked as a matter of course. It is in no way
unusual to find other dead animal's being dropped off at the
knackers/renderers or even being quietly buried under the 3 S Rule --
"shoot, shovel & shut up." A short-sighted decision at best and
results in significant later expenses. - Mod.MHJ]
