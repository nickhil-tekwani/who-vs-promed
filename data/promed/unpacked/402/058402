Influenza Season Strikes Early in Western Canada
------------------------------------------------
The influenza season has hit Canada early, clogging emergency rooms
in Edmonton and prompting calls from health officials across the
country for people to get immunized as soon as possible. "We've had
60 lab cases confirmed, but that's the tip of the iceberg. We've
probably had thousands of people affected," said Gerry Predy, medical
health officer for Capital Health, which serves 1.6 million people in
the Edmonton region.
Traffic to emergency rooms in that city has soared in the last few
days, causing treatment delays of hours in some cases. The region
said yesterday it is fast-tracking its annual winter plan to open
dozens more hospital beds to cope with the influenza crunch, and
urged patients to visit their family doctors or call provincial
health-care phone lines to ease the pressure at hospitals. But
Capital Health spokesman Ed Greenberg said people should continue to
go to emergency rooms if they think they need urgent care.
Health officials estimate between 500 and 1500 people die yearly from
influenza in Canada. The influenza season normally occurs between
November and March, with peaks in late December and again in late
February. But it emerged in some parts of Canada and the U.S. weeks
ago, long before influenza vaccination clinics became active.
In the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region, the first case of influenza
was reported on 1 Oct 2003, and to date there have been 82 confirmed
cases. During 2002, the first case wasn't reported until December.
According to the most recent statistics, Alberta had 105 confirmed
cases as of 18 Oct 2003, compared to none by that date last year.
However, influenza activity has been "very mild" in Ontario,
according to the province's Health Ministry.
According to the U.S. National Center for Infectious Diseases, as of
22 Oct 2003, influenza activity was widespread in Texas and sporadic
in Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, and New York.

[During 2003 influenza viruses of antigenic types A(H3N2), A(H1N1), & B have
been reported sporadically worldwide, local human-to-human transmission of an
avian-derived A(H7N7) virus has occurred in the Netherlands, and avian-to-
human transmission of an A(H5N1) virus in China (Hong Kong S.A.R.)
Influenza A(H3N2) virus infection occurred in 2 schools in Dublin, Ireland
during October 2003. This cluster of cases is considered to be the earliest
outbreak of influenza in Europe this season -- see:
<http://www.eiss.org/news.cgi>.
In the southern hemisphere during August 2003 all states in Australia
(except Northern Territory) have reported extensive outbreaks of
influenza. These have been identified as due to A(H3) type virus.
High levels of influenza A(H3) were recorded in New Zealand
throughout June and July 2003, declining during August. The levels of
influenza in New Zealand in 2003 have exceeded those observed in
2001-2002.
Information on the antigenic type (or types) of the influenza virus
responsible for the outbreaks in Western Canada would be appreciated.
