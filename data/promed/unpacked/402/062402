[As is noted in the description of the affected population, "the backyard goat farm is 800 m [approx. 875 yd] from the place where the 1st outbreak occurred 3 weeks ago in a red fox". The following comment by Mod.PMB, published in posting 20170310.4893209, is applicable here:

"Hungary was close to eliminating rabies. The last reported case was in 2010. Oral rabies vaccination of red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_) has been successful, but this episode alerts that campaigns should be continued and perhaps improved". - Mod CRD
