Four deaths (of cattle) were recorded during the weekend of 15 Aug [2016] in a farm at Lunévillois.

"It is reassuring, but we are still concerned because we do not know what caused the deaths," François Marchand, mayor of Meurthe-et-Moselle town of Hoéville in the district of Lunévillois [Alsace-Champagne-Ardenne-Lorraine region], sums up the feeling of the farmers after the 4 fatal cases were recorded during the weekend of 15 Aug 2016 in a herd of a dozen beasts.

Suspecting anthrax, the vet had informed the health authorities so that samples were taken from the 4 Salers (a breed of beef cattle). These were sent to the laboratory for Animal Health Maisons-Alfort by the PPPD (department for protection of the population), which has just released its conclusions: anthrax is not at the origin of death which occurred suddenly on a farm at Hoéville. Thus reassuring news, while the bacterium responsible for anthrax was identified in the neighboring region of Sarrebourg, in Moselle. No additional deaths of animals have been observed in Meurthe-et-Moselle in breeding or other herds. The affected farm will remain under surveillance a few more days.

Also reassuring news for anyone who may have been in contact with the 4 [dead] cattle, and more generally the population, "which has not been at risk," notes the herd veterinarian, not wishing to say more.

Anthrax excluded, the exact cause of death remains to be established. Poisoning, contamination by game? "Everything is possible," said François Marchand on the day of the removal of dead cattle by the renderers.

[Details on the population affected (size, age distribution) and on the age of the dead animals will be helpful.

When anthrax is suspected due to peracute death of bovine animals, the traditional differential diagnosis includes grass tetany and thunderbolt.

Observed pathological changes and further toxicological and other lab investigation results of the (apparently acute/peracute) deaths are anticipated.
