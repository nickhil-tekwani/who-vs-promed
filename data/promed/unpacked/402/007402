Clemson University Diagnostic Center says a horse in Horry County [South Carolina] has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus. It says it is the 2nd horse in Horry County to be infected with EEE so far this year [2016].

According to Jim Beasley SC-DHEC [South Carolina Department of Health & Environmental Control], EEE infection in livestock can be prevented through vaccination. Although rare, this disease can also be transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. DHEC says there are no cases of EEE in humans in South Carolina at this time.

EEE is a form of encephalitis, causing a swelling of the brain, sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting. The illness can progress into disorientation, seizures or coma, and can be deadly. There is no treatment for EEE.

According to health officials, you can reduce your risk of being infected with the EEE virus by using insect repellent, wearing protective clothing, and staying indoors when mosquitoes are most active.

[EEE is fatal in horses and easily prevented by vaccination. As this is just the 2nd case it is not too late to get your horses vaccinated, but do not delay. A dead horse is expensive. The vaccine is relatively cheap and very effective.
