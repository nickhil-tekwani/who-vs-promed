Jose Madrid Salsa of Zanesville, OH has issued a voluntary recall of Jose Madrid Salsa Original Mild Salsa packaged in 13-oz jars, due to potentially improperly sealed jars. An unknown number of jar lids may have been convex instead of vacuum sealed. Compromised seals or seams could result in product contamination by spoilage organisms or pathogens and may lead to illness if consumed. These jars were distributed in the Zanesville, OH and Baltimore, MD areas.

Approximately 96 jars of product sold are involved in this recall. Individual jars will show product lot code: 601 0101 04/20/16

There have been no reports to date of any illness associated with these products.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
