Black rot on grapes
-------------------
The rainy weather has been favorable for the development of black
rot, the most damaging grape disease in Ohio.

All cultivated varieties of grapes are susceptible to infection by
the black rot fungus. If not controlled, some or all of the grapes
within a cluster will rot. The disease is favored by warm, humid
weather that normally is experienced during the summer.

The most critical period to control black rot with fungicides is
during the period from early bloom through 3 to 4 weeks after bloom.

[Black rot of grapevine is caused by the fungus _Guignardia
bidwellii_. If uncontrolled, it can be devastating in terms of crop
loss. Symptoms include leaf lesions developing a black border and
shrivelling of berries on bunches ('mummies'). Leaf, cane, and tendril
infection can occur only when the tissue is young, but berries can be
infected until almost fully grown and eventually fall to the ground
where they serve as inoculum source for the rest of the season.

Spores are spread by splashing rain, wind, and mechanical means, and
wet weather favours the disease. Control with fungicides is effective
if well timed and if good spray coverage can be achieved. Moderate
levels of resistance have been identified in some grapevine hybrids.
