Rabid bat found on river path
-----------------------------
A bat found on a path near the Thames in Oxfordshire has tested positive
for a strain of rabies that is known to have killed humans. The female
Daubenton's bat [see picture in the above BBC URL] was discovered by
walkers near Abingdon Lock, Abingdon on 12 Sep 2006. It died a few days
later, and tests have since revealed that the animal carried the European
Bat Lyssavirus, closely linked to the classic rabies virus.
In 2002, a bat handler in Scotland died after contracting the virus. It is
thought the man, from Angus, had been bitten by a bat about 6 months
previously.
A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
(Defra) said the bat found in Abingdon had been cared for by the people who
found it and later handed it over to conservationists
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2006/061010c.htm>.
After its death, it was sent to a lab for routine testing, and although
initial results were negative, a further biological test showed the
presence of EBLV-type 2.The spokeswoman said: "The people who are known to
have cared for and handled the bat are receiving appropriate medical
treatment as a precautionary measure; the risk to their health is
negligible." Anyone who finds a sick or injured bat should not touch it but
contact a local bat conservation group or the Bat Conservation Trust, she
said. Anyone bitten or scratched by a bat should seek medical attention
immediately.
More than 6000 UK bats have been tested for rabies since 1986, and only 5
have been shown to carry the European Bat Lyssavirus (EBLV-type 2); all
were Daubenton's bats. One was found in Newhaven, Sussex in 1996, 2 in
Lancashire in 2002 and 2003 and one [in] Surrey in 2004.
Since 1977, 4 people have also died from the virus in Europe, where bat
rabies is more common. Daubenton's bats rarely roost in houses --
preferring habitats near water -- and the infection has not been found in
the more common Pipistrelle bat [picture at

[The following information, derived from an SNH press release of 30 Jun
2005 <http://www.snh.org.uk/scripts-snh/nw-displ.asp?ID=1224>, is related
to the above mentioned fatal EBLV-2 case in Scotland:
"Bat lyssavirus in Scotland
---------------------------
"In a study funded by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and the Scottish
Executive, scientists looking for signs of the rabies-like European Bat
Lyssavirus in Scotland's population of Daubenton's bats have, for the 2nd
year, found no live infection but have detected evidence of past exposure.
"Samples of blood and saliva were collected from 480 Daubenton's bats
across the country. Antibodies were found in 32.9 percent of blood samples,
indicating that these bats had been exposed to the virus at some point in
their lives but were not necessarily currently infected. As in a previous
study, no live virus was found in any of the samples.
"There is nothing in these findings to suggest the risk to people has
changed, and it remains very low. However, it is important to remind the
public in general and bat workers in particular that the current guidance
should still be followed. Anyone bitten or scratched by a bat should
immediately wash the area with soap and water and seek immediate medical
advice. Further guidance on management of bat bites is available on SHPIR."

In 2005, EBLV-1 antibodies were detected in the UK in another, larger bat
species, the European bat, serotine bat (_Eptesicus serotinus_); see

further background, see Mod.CP's commentary in posting 20050606.1576. - Mod.AS]
