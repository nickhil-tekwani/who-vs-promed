UN warns of possible epidemics in quake-hit Asia
-----------------------------------------------
The United Nations warned on Monday [27 Dec 2004] of epidemics within
days, unless health systems in southern Asia can cope, after more
than 15 500 people were killed, and hundreds of thousands left
homeless, by a giant tsunami.
Aid agencies around the world rushed staff, equipment and money to
southern Asia, after huge waves, triggered by a massive underwater
earthquake, pummeled and swamped coastal communities in at least 6
countries on Sunday [26 Dec 2004].
"This may be the worst natural disaster in recent history, because it
is affecting so many heavily populated coastal areas ... so many
vulnerable communities," the U.N.'s Emergency Relief Coordinator, Jan
Egeland, told CNN.
"The longer term effects may be as devastating as .... the tsunami
itself," said Egeland.
"Many more people are now affected by polluted drinking water. We
could have epidemics within a few days, unless we get health systems
up and running.
"Many people will have (had) their livelihoods, their whole future
destroyed in a few seconds."
Sri Lanka, India and Indonesia suffered the highest death tolls, but
Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar and Bangladesh were also hit by the
surging walls of water. Government officials estimate that in Sri
Lanka alone, 800 000 people were forced from their homes.
Experts said the top 5 issues to be addressed were water, sanitation,
food, shelter and health.
"ROTTING BODIES"
"We've had reports already from the south of India of bodies rotting
where they have fallen, and that will immediately affect the water
supply, especially for the most impoverished people," said Christian
Aid emergency officer Dominic Nutt.
Some affected areas have had communications cut. Others are so remote
that it is impossible to know the extent of the damage.
"This is a massive humanitarian disaster, and the communications are
so bad we still don't know the full scale of it. Unless we get aid
quickly to the people, many more could die," said Phil Esmond, head
of Oxfam in Sri Lanka.
The Geneva-based International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies said it was seeking an immediate USD 6.5 million
for emergency aid funding.
"This is a preliminary appeal. It will be revised after exact needs
are evaluated," said Simon Missiri, head of the federation's Asia
Pacific department.
Earlier, the federation released USD 870 000 from its disaster relief
emergency fund to get assistance moving to the region.
"The biggest health challenge we face is the spread of waterborne
diseases, particularly malaria and diarrhea, as well as respiratory
tract infections," said the Red Cross Federation's senior health
officer Hakan Sandbladh.
The federation said it would send an assessment and coordination team
to Sri Lanka and had on standby several emergency response units
specialized in water and sanitation, as well as field hospitals.
The United States said it would offer "all appropriate assistance" to
Asian countries, with some aid already on its way to Sri Lanka and
the Maldives.
"We're prepared to be very responsive," said State Department
spokesman Noel Clay.
The European Union pledged an initial EUR 3 million [USD 4 million],
and local news agency Belga said Belgium had allocated its own EUR
500 000 [USD 680 000] in emergency aid to be distributed by Red Cross
bodies and the EU.
Britain said it had offered what it called practical help.
"What we don't know is the number of people who've been displaced and
what infrastructure has been affected. That's the critical point,"
said Titon Mitra, emergency response director for the CARE aid agency
in Geneva.

[ProMED-mail does not usually report on natural disasters in the
absence of associated disease outbreaks. Given the enormous magnitude
of this event over such widespread geographical areas, the profound
disruptions to infrastructure, and the extent of endemic disease in
the areas affected, outbreaks are certain to follow, and ProMED-mail
will keep our readers informed of developments as early as possible.
The sympathy of our staff goes out to those affected.
We would like to remind readers that we are glad to offer our
services as a forum to help find technical assistance, and other
resources, and to direct them to areas where they are needed. -
