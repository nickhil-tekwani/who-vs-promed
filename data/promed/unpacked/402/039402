[Anthrax occurs sporadically in Siberian Russia and is sporadically
reported. Usually, as in this case, when there is a resultant human
case. Obviously there will be more livestock outbreaks as every animal
sick or dead from anthrax is not perforce fed to humans though it
happens often enough.

If this lady had been working in a cafe, there should be other reports
of other people ill from exposure the meat from the butchered sick
animal.
