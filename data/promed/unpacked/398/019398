Probable case of indigenous vCJD diagnosed in Ireland
--------------------------------------------------
A patient in Ireland has recently been diagnosed with probable variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease [abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or
vCJD] (1). Results of tests on the young male patient, which included tests
on a tonsillar biopsy, have confirmed that this is a probable case of vCJD.
The hospital has stated that the patient never received a blood transfusion
nor made a blood donation, and that the cause of infection is not linked to
an operation. The current patient has not lived abroad, and this is
therefore Ireland's 1st indigenous case (2). There has been one other vCJD
case in Ireland in the past. However, that patient had lived in the United
Kingdom in the 1980s, the time when the population was exposed to bovine
spongiform encephalopathy in meat products (3).
Ireland has the 2nd highest rate of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
in cattle in the world. In 2003, an expert team at the Irish National CJD
Surveillance Unit (<http://www.eurocjd.ed.ac.uk/IRELAND.htm>) modelled the
possible risk to the Irish population based on relative exposure to
BSE-contaminated meat and infectivity of bovine tissue (4). Their analysis
indicated that one case of vCJD would be expected in the future.
Measures to reduce the risk of exposure to the vCJD causative agent via
consumption of infected bovine tissue were applied in farming and meat
processing in 1996 and via blood donation since 1999 (Irish Blood
Transfusion Service,
<http://www.ibts.ie/generic.cfm?mID=7&sID=106&ssID=21>).
