Southern States - Tamil Nadu 26 Aug 2003
----------------------------------------
There has been a fresh outbreak of dengue in Kanyakumari district, and 6
children, suspected to be suffering from the fever, were referred to the
government medical college hospital at Kottar today. These children, aged
between 4 months and 9 years, had hitherto been undergoing treatment at the
government hospitals at Thuckalay and Kuzhithurai, bordering Kerala [state].
The disease claimed the lives of 2 children at Ambalakadai several days ago
in addition to infecting 6 others in the Ambalakadai and Villukury areas.
The latter were initially admitted to the government hospitals at
Kuzhithurai and Thuckalay with symptoms of dengue, and today all of them
were referred to the medical college hospital at Kottar.
So far, 6 children from Marthandam and surrounding areas have died since
the outbreak began a couple of months ago. Of 417 blood samples obtained
from the suspected patients and sent to the Institute of Vector Control,
Hosur, and the Institute of Research Control, Madurai, 46 have been found
to have dengue fever, and all of them are undergoing treatment in various
hospitals in the district.
On Monday, a medical team under the additional director of public health,
Jagadish Ramasamy, and including entomologists S Subbiah and R Varadarajan,
have already arrived from Chennai and launched an awareness campaign,
according to sources at the Directorate of Public Health office.
An official said the health and municipal authorities had already launched
antilarval and fogging operations, as the disease is spread mainly through
the bite of the _Aedes_ mosquito. The problem is worse in the
plantation-dominated areas of Melpuram, Thuckalay, and Muncherai blocks.
The deputy director of health services, Inbaraj Manohar, has gone to
Thiruvananthapuram to confer with the government health officials there, as
the fever had spread from the Kerala capital.

Dengue outbreak now contained: health office
--------------------------------------------
The Integrated Provincial Health Office (IPHO) confirmed on Monday that the
dengue outbreak that downed 37 people, most of whom were schoolchildren in
Negros Oriental, is now under control.
Dr Bernarda Cortes, IPHO assistant provincial officer, said that aside from
4 children confined at the Negros Oriental Provincial Hospital due to
bleeding from the mosquito-transmitted viral disease, the remaining victims
are convalescing at the Zamboanguita Municipal Health Center. Health
workers have been working around the clock since the start of the outbreak
last week to monitor the condition of the affected children.
Prior to the outbreak, IPHO figures showed only 2 dengue cases reported in
Zamboanguita from January to June of 2003. By the middle of August, one
more case was reported in the adjacent village of Maluay, and from there
the number swelled, with new cases reported from Poblacion and Mayabon
village, subsequently peaking at 37 with 4 children in serious condition.
To address the problem, the Municipal Government released its disaster fund
and started a massive defogging campaign in schools and mosquito breeding
places. Cortes said the outbreak was controlled before the end of last week.
Zamboanguita registered one dead at the height of the dengue outbreak that
hit Negros Oriental in 1998.
IPHO records show Dumaguete City with 62 cases still leading the list of
the province's 20 towns and 5 cities in the province out of 122 individuals
affected by dengue from January to June this year [2003].
