[A report on weekly findings of highly pathogenic avian influenza (bird flu) H5N8 in wild birds in Great Britain is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/636054/ai-findings-1617.csv/preview.

"This report is produced by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and is updated weekly with findings of the H5N8 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) -- often referred to as bird flu -- in wild birds in Great Britain.

These are findings of avian influenza of the subtype H5N8 from our ongoing routine surveillance for avian influenza in wild birds. This surveillance is made up of patrols by wild bird reserve wardens and collections of found-dead wild birds reported to us by members of the public. These data only represent cases where birds have tested positive for H5N8." https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/avian-influenza-in-wild-birds-winter-2016-to-2017. - Mod.CRD
