[1] India - trivalent oral poliovirus

At least 3 batches of polio vaccines containing 1.5 lakh [150 000] vials have been found contaminated with type 2 polio virus, putting at risk India's "polio free" status as children born after April 2016 -- when the type 2 virus was withdrawn worldwide including in India -- do not have immunity to this particular virus, sources said.

The health ministry and the World Health Organisation (WHO) have stepped up surveillance, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Telangana where the contaminated vaccines were administered to children. The vaccines were manufactured by Ghaziabad-based firm Biomed, as reported by TOI in its [29 Sep 2018] edition.

"The contamination can have very serious ramifications on public health because it is tantamount to reintroducing into the community a virus that had been eradicated. The WHO and health authorities are keeping a close watch for any active strain of the virus in stool samples or in sewage," a senior official said. The ministry has set up a 3-member committee to probe how the eradicated virus got introduced again even after orders for its destruction from the manufacturing and supply chain. The panel has been asked to submit its report within a week.

While the Biomed managing director was arrested on [Thu 27 Sep 2018], 4 of its directors are absconding, the official said. The drugs controller general of India has filed a First Information Report [FIR - a written document prepared by police organizations when they receive information about the commission of a cognisable offence. - Mod.MP] and issued a showcause notice to the company asking it to stop manufacturing till further orders.

According to experts, all oral polio vaccines (OPV) contain live [attenuated] polio viruses that are shed by vaccinated children in their stool. Now, the government, regulatory authorities and medical practitioners are worried that if type 2 [vaccine] virus passes into the sewage or water system, it may regain neuro-virulence and spread polio. "Another major risk is of virus mutation, which is a common phenomenon in 3 to 6 months," the official said.

Earlier, trivalent polio vaccines containing type 1, 2 and 3 were in use but after the type 2 polio virus was eradicated worldwide, governments switched to bivalent vaccines, containing only type 1 and type 3 viruses. In 2016, India, in line with WHO guidance, had ordered withdrawal and destruction of all trivalent OPV stocks by April 2016.

Biomed supplied polio vaccines for the government's universal immunisation programme. The contamination was 1st suspected when surveillance reports from UP showed signs of the virus in stool samples of some children. Following these reports, samples of OPV vaccines were lifted by drug inspectors and sent for testing to the Central Drug Laboratory in Kasauli, which confirmed the contamination.

Though the government has ordered immunisation of children with additional doses in the 3 states, it is difficult to identify those children quickly, the official said.

In March 2014, India was officially declared "polio free" by WHO. The last case of wild polio virus type 2 in the country was in 1999. However, India continues to maintain a highly sensitive surveillance system for polio. All cases of paralysis with sudden onset in children up to 15 years (which is called acute flaccid paralysis or AFP) are picked up by the polio surveillance network. Each of these cases is followed up and stool samples tested for polio virus in WHO accredited laboratories. In addition, sewage samples are collected from over 30 sites across the country for polio virus detection at regular intervals.

[A key goal of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is the total removal of all polioviruses from circulation. This includes the wild poliovirus (WPV), the oral polio vaccine virus (OPV), and all forms of vaccine derived polioviruses (VDPV). As stated in previous commentaries, the OPV2 virus has the greatest tendency for neurovirulence reversion into a cVDPV2 (circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2), with the neurovirulence reversion related to multiple passages through susceptible individuals -- analogous to the original procedure used to develop the OPV2 virus through multiple passages to attenuate the WPV2 (wild poliovirus type 2). In order for this to occur, it requires a sizable population of susceptible individuals to the type 2 poliovirus. As WPV2 transmission has been interrupted since 1999 when the last case was confirmed in Aligarh, northern India in 1999, in the absence of vaccination with the OPV2 component, there is no longer a source for naturally acquired antibodies to the type 2 poliovirus. Hence, unless the population maintains a high enough vaccination level to permit a functional herd immunity (where a virus cannot find a susceptible host), there remains a risk of development of cVDPV2 when the OPV2 component is included in vaccination activities. To prevent this occurrence, there was a worldwide shift to the use of bivalent OPV, without the OPV2 component, and simultaneous inclusion of a single dose of inactivated trivalent polio vaccine (IPV) beginning in April 2016. Unfortunately, the worldwide needs for IPV exceeded the vaccine production capabilities for several months so a cohort of poliovirus 2 susceptible children occurred, many of whom were not captured during subsequent vaccination activities. In a country with a population above 1.3 billion (2017 World Bank estimate https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.pop.totl), and an estimated birthrate of 19/1000 population (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.CBRT.IN), this brought the 2016 cohort available for vaccination to approximately 24.7 million children, a sizeable potentially susceptible population. Putting this into perspective, Uttar Pradesh -- one of the states where this vaccine was distributed and used --, had an estimated population of 218.4 million in 2016 (http://indiapopulation2018.in/population-of-uttar-pradesh-2018.html), with an estimated crude birth rate of 26.2/1000 population (http://www.censusindia.gov.in/vital_statistics/SRS_Report_2016/7.Chap_3-Fertility_Indicators-2016.pdf), with an estimated number of newborns in 2016 of 5.7 million.

That being said, the India government has been very diligent in maintaining their polio free status, and vaccination activities have continued with full force. Summary, if this vaccine hasn't reached pockets of unimmunized individuals, there shouldn't be any negative repercussions of the use of this vaccine... time will tell.

[2] Papua New Guinea - fatality

A boy has died from polio in Papua New Guinea in the 1st fatal case since an outbreak of the disease in June [2018]. WHO said on Tue [25 Sep 2018] that the boy died in Enga province, one of 14 confirmed cases across the country.

Speaking at the launch of a nationwide polio vaccination campaign on [Mon 1 Oct 2018], the WHO representative in the country, Luo Dapeng, said that there had been 5 confirmed cases in Eastern Highlands province, 3 in Morobe, 2 in Enga, 2 in Madang, 1 in Port Moresby and 1 in Jiwaka, the Papua New Guinea Post Courier website said.

The country's health department said the child died when the muscles around the lungs became paralysed by the virus, Radio NZ said. One of the other 14 victims died in September [2018] but he was also infected with meningitis and tuberculosis and his death was not attributed to polio.

The country was declared polio-free in 2000 but the rate of vaccinations has been falling in recent years and an outbreak was confirmed earlier this year [2018].

The virus, which mainly affects children, causes paralysis of varying degrees of seriousness. It spreads through faecal-oral contamination, multiplies in the intestines, and then to the nervous system. There is no cure for the disease, which can only be combated by vaccinations in childhood.

[We usually do not hear of fatalities associated with the polio outbreaks, so hearing of this death serves as a reminder that it is not a mild disease, and the consequences can include residual permanent paralysis as well as death during the acute phase of the illness.
