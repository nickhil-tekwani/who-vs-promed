In England, 9 human cases of infection with _Salmonella newport_ with
a possible link to a salad item have been identified as part of the
PHLS/LACOTS survey of retail prepared pre-packed ready-to-eat salad
vegetables in the United Kingdom (1).
Cases range in age from 4 to 74 years (median 33 years) and are
distributed throughout England. Onset dates of illness range from 2
Jun to 8 Jun 2001. Salad consumption has been confirmed in 6 cases and
food histories are awaited from the other 2. The 2 cases from one area
(who are not related to each other) are known to have consumed the
implicated salad item 3 and 6 days prior to the onset of illness. One
of the 6 cases from whom a food history has been obtained is known to
be a vegetarian. None of the cases travelled abroad during the
incubation period.
Isolates from the salad item and the 9 cases exhibit an unusual
reaction with the PHLS Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens phage typing
scheme for _S. newport_. Additional molecular work has shown that
isolates from the salad and 5 of the human cases have a unique plasmid
profile. The salad isolate and 3 of the human isolates are also
indistinguishable using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Examination
of the remaining human isolates using molecular methods is underway.
On 22 Jun 2001 an urgent request for information was sent to all
participants in the Enter-net (http://www.Enter-net.org.uk)
surveillance network (2). Of the 7 countries that had replied by 28
Jun 2001, none reported an increase in human cases of _S. newport_ in
recent weeks. Several countries reported on foodstuffs contaminated
with this serotype, but these were predominantly strains from poultry
samples, and a few strains had been isolated from reptiles.
Salmonellosis associated with the consumption of salad items is
relatively uncommon, although 2 notable outbreaks occurred last year.
In a widespread outbreak of multiresistant _S. typhimurium_ DT104
infection in England, where 361 people were affected and one person
was known to have died, illness was epidemiologically linked to the
consumption of lettuce away from home in the 3 days prior to the onset
of illness. Investigations in Iceland into a Europe-wide outbreak of
multiresistant _S. typhimurium_ DT204b (which included 125 cases in
England and Wales) revealed an association between illness and the
consumption of imported iceberg lettuce (3).
