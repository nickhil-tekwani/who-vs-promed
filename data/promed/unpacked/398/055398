African horse sickness outbreak 'getting worse'
----------------------------------------------
Horses are dying in their hundreds from an outbreak of African Horse
Sickness [AHS] and the problem is worsening, says the department of
agriculture.
Over the past 2 months, 586 horses in KwaZulu-Natal's Midlands area and 2
horses in the Western Cape have died of the disease. This year's outbreak
is the largest on record, said Vusi Zuma, spokesman for the KZN department
of agriculture.
The state is taking measures to restrict the spread of the disease,
according to Gary Bohrmann, chief state veterinarian for the Boland.
"Since April, we have placed a ban on horses entering the Western Cape from
outbreak areas in Natal. We have been doing this for the last 3 years,"
said Bohrmann.
Authorities and horse owners have expressed concern that the vaccine for
the disease does not offer effective protection against new strains of the
virus. One form of the sickness, Strain 5, is unprotected by the vaccine,
and has appeared in a number of cases across the country. [In posting
20050423.1141, the withdrawal of AHSV 5 from the polyvalent AHS vaccine was
referred to, requesting an update of the current composition of the
commercially available vaccine(s). - Mod.AS]
One of the 2 horses that died in the Cape had come from KwaZulu-Natal and
was diagnosed as carrying Strain 5.
Veterinarians are currently working on a comprehensive vaccine to
effectively protect all horses, Bohrmann said.
African Horse Sickness is not a [directly] contagious disease, but is
transmitted by midges that bite infected horses and pass it to healthy ones.
The winter cold kills the midges, hindering their reproduction and allowing
for a slowing of any outbreak. Authorities generally wait until the 1st
signs of frost in July to lift travel bans.
South African horse exporters are under a 2-year embargo imposed by the
European Union (EU) last year following an outbreak of African horse sickness.
The embargo is costing the industry about R50 million [8.2 million USD] a
year, but the EU is considering lifting it early, according to Bohrmann.
Although the disease was a growing concern, it should not greatly affect
horse racing in South Africa, said Colin Hall, manager of racing
administration for the National Horse racing Authority.
"We have strict control measures in place that deal with this disease to
ensure that the impact on racing is minimal. We generally get only 4 or 5
cases a year," said Hall. "Owners have to get permits from veterinarians
before they can move their horses, so the restrictions make planning races
a bit more complicated."
Last year [2004], an equine flu outbreak brought racing to a standstill for
2 months, leading to the postponement of the prestigious J&B Met.

[Though AHS is not directly contagious, viraemic horses may introduce the
virus into receptive areas during the vector's activity season, infecting
the local culicoides population and, subsequently, local equines. This
emphasizes the importance of full compliance to the applied animal movement
restrictions, particularly during the late-summer and autumn months.
AHS is known to be transmitted in South Africa by at least 2 culicoides
species, namely _C. imicola_ and _C. bolitinos_. _C. imicola_ is the most
common species, but in general prefers warmer, lower altitudes. This
species breeds in saturated or wet soils containing a high level of organic
material. _C. imicola_ is also the main vector of another epizootic disease
caused by an orbivirus, namely bluetongue (BT) of ruminants (predominantly
sheep).
_C. bolitinos_ is a member of the Imicola complex of 7 species in South
Africa. In 1998 it was implicated in an outbreak of AHS in the eastern Free
State, South Africa, and also in the laboratory was shown to be susceptible
to infection with AHS and BT viruses. This species is also widespread in
the Afro-tropical regions and, like _C. imicola_, is known to feed on both
cattle and horses. However, the breeding habitat of _C. bolitinos_ is the
dung of cattle, buffalo and wildebeest, which provides a stable and
constant breeding microclimate for larval development. Hence, _C.
bolitinos_ is more abundant than _C. imicola_ in areas with lower average
temperatures, including cooler, mountainous regions. This was the case in
2003 in the Drakensberg mountains at an altitude of above 1500 metres,
where many owners did not vaccinate and the disease had not been reported
for at least 50 years (see 20030318.0675).
Experimentally, _C. bolitinos_ was found to be a potential vector of AHS
virus serotypes 3, 5, and 8. [See GJ Venter, SD Graham, C Hamblin. In:
Medical & Veterinary Entomology, Vol 14, 3 , 245 - Sep 2000: African horse
sickness epidemiology: vector competence of South African Culicoides
species for virus serotypes 3, 5 and 8.
