Identical sources in the Sirte Company's Waha oil field said that 80 cases of food poisoning were recorded among users inside the field. The sources indicated to Libya 24 News Agency today [22 Jun 2022] that the cases developed symptoms not after lunch, but after dinner. The same sources indicated that the cases showed symptoms of food poisoning, diarrhea, vomiting and fever, and about 80 people visited the clinic.

The sources added that food poisoning was possible, and it had occurred before, in other locations; if it was not from the same field, perhaps from the [same] source, likely to be caused by rotten meat ("meat and chicken"). In a related context, the Oasis [Waha] Company's health and safety department reassured all the families of the users present in the Oasis field that they were all in good health and there was no truth to the news circulating on social media pages that promoted the news of rotten meat.

The police confirmed the presence of a number of cases of diarrhea accompanied by a high temperature, and that the company had taken all measures to check on the health of users, and tomorrow some samples will be taken to conduct the necessary analyses to find out the reasons that led to this.
