From January to September 2013, a marked increase in notifications of _Salmonella [enterica_] serotype Paratyphi A infections among travellers returning from Cambodia occurred in France. An investigation revealed 35 cases without a common source: 21 in France, 5 in Germany, 3 in the Netherlands, one in Norway, one in the United Kingdom, and 4 in New Zealand. Data suggest an ongoing event that should trigger further investigation. Travellers to Cambodia should observe preventive measures including good personal hygiene and food handling practices. Concurrently, an increase in _S._ Paratyphi A infections in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, starting in 2011 but with heightened numbers in 2013, was identified. Here we report mainly on the preliminary findings of the investigation of the French cases.

Background
----------
_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Paratyphi A only affects humans and is a cause of paratyphoid fever. Paratyphoid fever can also be caused by _S. enterica_ serotypes Paratyphi B d-tartrate non-fermenting or Paratyphi C, and remains a major cause of morbidity in countries with poor sanitation, with an estimated 5.5 million cases occurring annually [1]. In high-income countries, the majority of paratyphoid fever cases are imported from endemic regions. Transmission is fecal-oral, through consumption of contaminated food or water, as well as person-to-person. The incubation period ranges from 5 to 21 days depending on the inoculum ingested. Acute illness is characterised by fever and malaise; other non-specific symptoms include headaches, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, maculopapular rash and enlarged spleen. Chronic carriage can occur following acute infection. Reported case-fatality rate is approximately one percent and can be lowered by prompt use of adequate antibiotic therapy [2,3]. Resistance to various drugs including ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and quinolones is increasing worldwide, and effective treatment requires adapted antibiotic therapy [4,5]. Good personal hygiene and food handling practices are the only preventive measures as there is no effective vaccine against paratyphoid infection [6].

Situation in France
-----------------------
In France, typhoid and paratyphoid fever have been notifiable diseases since 1903. In addition to mandatory reporting, clinical laboratories forward the isolates to the National Reference Centre for Salmonella (NRC) at the Pasteur Institute in Paris on a voluntary basis. Between 2003 and 2012, 272 cases of paratyphoid A fever were reported (annual range: 18-36), including only 7 cases among travelers returning from Cambodia.

On 22 Aug 2013, the NRC notified the French National Institute for Public Health Surveillance (InVS) in Paris, about an unusual increase in the number of cases of paratyphoid A fever among travelers returning from Cambodia: from 1 Jan to 22 Aug 2013, 14 cases had been identified at the NRC. We initiated an investigation to determine the magnitude of the event and to identify potential sources of infection.

Investigation of the event and results
--------------------------------
We defined a case as culture-confirmed _S._ Paratyphi A infection diagnosed in 2013 in a person who reported a travel history to Cambodia in the month prior to symptom onset. We merged data from both the NRC and the notifiable diseases surveillance system. Identified persons were contacted by phone, and demographics, clinical data, exposure history and details about their journey in Cambodia were collected using a specifically designed questionnaire.

As _S._ Paratyphi A is known to be a highly clonal organism that pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) or multilocus sequence typing (MLST) techniques can hardly discriminate, the NRC focused microbiological characterization on antimicrobial susceptibility testing and attempted to discriminate isolates by using sequencing of the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) contents, as previously described [7,8]. We carried out antimicrobial susceptibility testing on all available _S._ Paratyphi A isolates by using the disk diffusion method, with a panel of 32 antimicrobial drugs (Bio-Rad, Marnes-La-Coquette, France). We determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and azithromycin using Etests (bioMÃ©rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), as previously described [9]. The results were then interpreted using the breakpoints of the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society for Microbiology (CA-SFM).

On 28 Aug 2013, the InVS sent out an alert through the European Epidemic Intelligence Information System for Food- and Waterborne Diseases (EPIS-FWD) of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to inform other European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) Member States and associated national public health institutes about the event and to query about any recent increase in their reported cases of paratyphoid A fever with a travel history to Cambodia. Countries that responded and reported cases with a travel history to Cambodia in 2013 were contacted by ECDC to obtain additional information. Moreover, ECDC used the European Surveillance System (TESSy) to compare the number of cases with a travel history to Cambodia reported in the EU/EEA in 2013 with previous years. On 28 Aug 2013, when available information suggested a multinational event, the French health authorities sent out an Early Warning Response System (EWRS) message, and on 4 Sep 2013, ECDC posted a rapid risk assessment on its website to alert a wider audience about the event [10].

Cases notified in France
-------------------
In France, from 1 Jan 2013 to 20 Sep 2013, 21 cases of paratyphoid A fever among persons with a travel history to Cambodia in the month prior to symptom onset were reported. This represents a significant increase in the reported number of cases since only 87 cases were reported between 2003 and 2012: 2 in 2003, 3 in 2004, one in 2005 and one in 2012. Dates of symptom onset ranged from 30 Jan to 31 Aug 2013 (Figure [for figure, see original URL. - Mod.LL]), and dates for reported travel history to Cambodia ranged from 23 Jan 2013 to 27 Aug 2013.

Median age of infected persons was 40 years (range: 4-65 years), 67 percent were female, and 86 percent were hospitalized. Clinical data were available for 17/21 cases. Among patients for whom medical information was available, all presented with fever; 16/17 complained of asthenia; 13/17 had chills; 12/17 had diarrhea; 11/17 had headaches; 9/17 had abdominal pain, and 4/17 had nausea or vomiting. Median length of hospitalization was 5 days (range: 1-13). All patients fully recovered. Median length of stay in Cambodia was 19 days (range: 4-81 days). Six persons experienced symptoms during their trip in Cambodia, and 13 had symptom onset after their return home. For the 6 persons who had symptoms while in Cambodia, none sought medical attention during their trip, and median lag between arrival and symptom onset was 34 days (range: 11-61). For the 13 persons who had symptoms after their departure from Cambodia, median lag between departure and symptom onset was 12 days (range: 2-26).

One person continued to shed _S._ Paratyphi A in his urine 4 months after diagnosis, which caused secondary transmission to a household member who presented with bacteremia. Illnesses occurred in tourists visiting Cambodia and travelers visiting relatives. Interviews did not identify any common exposure (such as hotel, restaurant, airline company or tourist site) that could explain all cases; 1/17 interviewees only visited the city of Phnom Penh, 2/17 interviewees visited Phnom Penh and Siem Reap areas only, and 14/17 visited at least 3 different cities. Overall, all 17 interviewees visited Phnom Penh area; 12/17 visited Siem Reap area; 11/17 visited Sihanoukville area, whereas other geographic areas were visited by less than 4/17 interviewees. No common exposure or common activity was identified in Phnom Penh. 14 of the 21 cases had solely traveled to Cambodia, whereas the remaining 7 cases also reported brief travel to Thailand, Viet Nam, Myanmar or China prior to symptom onset. The majority of interviewees reported consumption of at-risk food items during their trip: 15/17 ate raw vegetables or drank raw fruit juices; 16/17 had drinks with ice, and 15/17 were not vaccinated against typhoid fever.

_S._ Paratyphi A isolates were available at the NRC for 18/21 cases with a travel history to Cambodia, which accounted for 45 percent of _S._ Paratyphi A isolates received at the NRC as of 20 Sep 2013. All isolates were fully susceptible to a panel of 32 antibiotics systematically tested at the NRC, including ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones and azithromycin. A unique CRISPR profile was found in all 18 isolates and belonged to the dominant profile found in the NRC CRISPR database (36/48 _S._ Paratyphi A isolates).

Cases notified in other countries
---------------------------
Following the EPIS-FWD alert sent out by the InVS on 28 Aug 2013, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom (UK) and New Zealand reported cases of _S._ Paratyphi A infection identified in 2013 among travelers returning from Cambodia. Since 1 Jan 2013, 35 cases of paratyphoid A fever have been reported among travelers returning from Cambodia, including the 21 cases in France, 5 cases in Germany, 3 cases in the Netherlands, one case in Norway, one case in the UK, and 4 cases in New Zealand. For the EU/EEA countries, this represents a significant increase, since only 3 imported cases from Cambodia were reported in the EU/EEA in 2012 (2 by Germany, one by France). No reliable data were available for 2010 and 2011. In addition to the 18 isolates tested in France, 5 additional isolates from other countries were available and were fully susceptible to all tested antibiotics. Austria, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Portugal, Slovenia and Sweden reported having no cases in 2013 to date. The Table [for Table, see original URL. - Mod.LL] summarizes the number of reported cases of paratyphoid A fever among travellers returning from Cambodia in 2013 in the EU/EEA and in New Zealand.

Discussion
---------
A marked increase in imported cases of _S._ Paratyphi A infections from Cambodia to France occurred from January to September 2013. Other EU/EEA countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, the UK, as well as New Zealand also reported cases, although numbers might not differ from the expected baseline range. Occurrence of cases over several months among persons with travel history in different Cambodian geographic areas and without any common exposure identified despite in depth interviews suggests that sources of contamination are persistent and potentially multiple. All 17 French interviewees have visited Phnom Penh; however, Phnom Penh is the primary point of entry for travelers in Cambodia. Available information from a referral hospital in Phnom Penh reported in this issue of Eurosurveillance by Vlieghe et al. shows a recent increase in _S._ Paratyphi A infections since March 2013 in residents of Cambodia and particularly in the Phnom Penh area [11]. This study suggests that the rate of infection is higher in Phnom Penh compared to other regions of Cambodia. However, the study site is located in Phnom Penh, and, therefore, recruitment bias might have affected this finding. Further investigation should be conducted to determine affected areas and to identify sources of contamination of residents of Cambodia.

According to the Cambodian Ministry of Tourism data, 121 175 French tourists travelled to Cambodia in 2012, versus 110 182 British, 72 537 Germans, 24 559 Dutch, 8251 Norwegians, and 19 044 New Zealanders [12]. Assuming that the number of travelers to Cambodia by country of residence in 2013 does not significantly differ from the 2012 data (available information suggests similar proportions up to May 2013), these statistics suggest that the large number of French tourists visiting Cambodia could have contributed to the predominance of French nationals among the imported cases. Taking into account the number of travelers by country, the proportions of French, British, German, Dutch, Norwegians and New Zealanders among the cases are one per 5770 French travelers, one per 110 182 British travelers, one per 14 507 German travelers, one per 8186 Dutch travelers, one per 8251 Norwegian travelers, and one per 4761 New Zealander travelers. The observed differences between countries might reflect differences in travel routes among international travelers as well as in food habits during travel and in surveillance systems between European countries.

The strains' full susceptibility profile to all antibiotics tested appears common in southeast Asia, whereas the spread of _S._ Paratyphi A strains resistant to quinolones has been described in the Indian subcontinent [13]. CRIPSR typing results suggest that CRISPR typing was not sufficiently powerful in discriminating isolates. Further subtyping of available isolates, i.e. PFGE analysis with 2 enzymes, is ongoing.

Additional cases might occur if the source(s) of contamination persist. However, spread within the EU/EEA through secondary human-to-human transmission is expected to be limited: only one case of secondary transmission among household members has been documented in France so far. Clinicians in travel clinics and in infectious diseases hospitals should be alerted about the increase in the number of _S._ Paratyphi A infections among travelers returning from Cambodia. Advice about preventive measures, including personal hygiene and food handling practices, should be reinforced for travelers to Cambodia before their departure. As for other low and middle income countries, travelers to Cambodia should observe these measures and should seek medical attention as soon as possible should they present symptoms during their trip or after they return to their country of residence. Although there is no efficient vaccine available against paratyphoid fever, travelers to Cambodia should consider typhoid fever vaccine prior to their trip, unlike the majority of interviewed travellers described in this report, as data from Vlieghe et al. also strongly suggest an ongoing increase in typhoid fever cases in Phnom Penh area [11] .

Finally, whenever possible, travelers returning from Cambodia diagnosed with _S._ Paratyphi A infection should be interviewed by public health authorities; their travel route in Cambodia should be detailed, and information should be shared with other countries and Cambodian health authorities to help shed light on any potential source of infection.

[2] Paratyphoid A - Cambodia
Date: Thu 26 Sep 2013
Source: Eurosurveillance, Volume 18, Issue 39 [edited]
http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20592


Between 1 Jan 2011 and 31 Aug 2013, there has been a marked increase of _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Paratyphi A cases diagnosed from blood cultures in Cambodian citizens, particularly in 2013, and this was reflected in an increased recovery of this pathogen from European travellers returning from Cambodia between January and August 2013 [1].

_S. enterica_ is an important pathogen in many low and middle income countries [2]. The serovars Typhi and Paratyphi cause enteric fever (i.e. typhoid and paratyphoid fever, respectively) and are particularly prevalent in south and southeast Asia. Treatment has become challenging because of emerging antibiotic resistance to 1st-line antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, ampicillin, sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP), and, more recently, fluoroquinolones [3]. Over the past 2 decades, _S._ Paratyphi A has become increasingly prevalent in Asia, causing between 15 percent (Pakistan, Indonesia) and 64 percent (southeast China) of enteric fever cases in these countries [4]. Typhoid and paratyphoid fever are also endemic in Cambodia [5-7]. Nationwide surveillance of incidence and antibiotic resistance patterns is, however, largely lacking due to the country's very limited microbiology laboratory infrastructure [8]. Since July 2007, the Cambodian non-governmental (NGO) hospital Sihanouk Hospital Centre of HOPE (SHCH) in Phnom Penh and the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium co-organise surveillance of bloodstream infections in Cambodian adults attending SHCH. The 30-bed adults' hospital and its associated clinics provide over 135 000 outpatient visits and about 1000 hospitalizations per year of patients from across Cambodia. Of 6881 blood cultures drawn between July 2007 and December 2010, we recorded 2 patients infected with _S._ Paratyphi A [9].

Laboratory procedures for surveillance of bloodstream infections
-------------------------------
From all patients presenting at SHCH with signs of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [10], 2 x 10 ml of venous blood are sampled by separate venipuncture with registration of demographic and clinical data (i.e. sex, age, province and district of residence, co-morbidity, prior use of antibiotics, type and duration of symptoms, presumed focus of infection, and hospitalisation status). Blood is cultured in BacT/ALERT culture bottles (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) which are incubated at 35 C for 7 days and checked once daily for growth by visual inspection of the chromogenic growth indicator. When positive, blood cultures are Gram stained and, in case Gram-negative rods are present, inoculated on MacConkey agar and 5 percent sheep blood agar (BIO-RAD, Hercules, United States). In addition, blood culture vials with no indication of growth after 3 days of incubation are subcultured on sheep blood agar. As part of standard patient care, isolates are identified by conventional methods and assessed for antibiotic susceptibility by disk diffusion (Neo-SensitabsTM, Rosco Diagnostica, Taastrup, Denmark) according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute [11]. Serotyping is carried out by slide agglutination with commercial antisera according to the Kauffmann-White scheme [12].

In this report, "paratyphoid fever" and "typhoid fever" cases were defined as a patient with culture-confirmed bloodstream infection due to _S._ Paratyphi A or _S._ Typhi, respectively. Patients with blood cultures that did not grow after complete work-up or that revealed pathogens other than "_S._ Typhi/Paratyphi A" were not considered cases for the purpose of this investigation.

Ethical approval was granted by the review boards at Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, the University Hospital Antwerp, and the National Ethics Committee for Health Research, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

Surveillance of blood cultures, 1 Jan 2011 to 31 Aug 2013
--------------------
Between 1 Jan 2011 and 31 Aug 2013, 102 cases of enteric fever were diagnosed in Cambodian citizens, i.e. 71 with paratyphoid fever and 31 with typhoid fever. Seven cases were recorded in 2011, 20 in 2012, and 75 in the 1st 8 months of 2013. As shown in Figure 1 [For figures, see original URL. - Mod.LL], paratyphoid fever cases were observed more frequently from April 2012, and numbers increased further from March 2013 onwards. Typhoid fever cases increased as well but to a lesser extent.

47 percent (i.e. 35 of 71 (49.3 percent) paratyphoid cases and 13/31 (41.9 percent) typhoid cases) were female, with a median age of 24 years (range 7-54 years); ages of paratyphoid and typhoid cases were not significantly different. Out of 71 paratyphoid fever cases, 56 lived in the greater Phnom Penh area (Figure 2), particularly in the following districts: Russey Keo (n=10), Chamkar Mon (n=9), Tuol Kouk (n=8), Mean Chey (n=8), Dangkao (n=7), Prampir Makara (n=3), Por Senchey (n=3), Doun Penh (n=1) (Figure 3). Typhoid fever cases were more dispersed: 19 of 31 were from Phnom Penh but distributed in small numbers among a large number of districts.

Preliminary susceptibility data based on laboratory files revealed that only one of 71 (1.4 percent) _S._ Paratyphi A isolates was resistant to ampicillin, none to sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP), and 3 (4.2 percent) displayed nalidixic acid resistance. In contrast, 14 out of 31 _S._ Typhi isolates were ampicillin resistant; 11 were SMX-TMP resistant, and all but 2 isolates were nalidixic acid resistant. Six isolates displayed a high level ciprofloxacin resistance. Results of minimal inhibitory concentrations for ciprofloxacin are pending. Empiric treatment included most often ceftriaxone followed by oral ciprofloxacin. So far, there was neither in-hospital mortality nor relapse recorded.

Discussion and conclusion
---------------------------
Between Jan 2011 and Aug 2013, and particularly in the 1st 8 months of 2013, we noted a remarkable increase in paratyphoid fever mainly among young adults treated in our hospital and clinics in Phnom Penh. Compared to the recovery of only 2 _S._ Paratyphi A isolates during the surveillance period 2007-2010 [9], this represents a 44-fold increase, while the monthly rate of blood cultures remained constant around 150-200. In June 2013, we observed a temporary drop in cases for which we do not have a conclusive explanation, although it may be possible that cases coincidentally visited other healthcare facilities (mostly without culture facilities) within the metropolitan area.

Although it was not possible in the present setting to calculate population-based incidence data, the clustering in time and place of the recent _S._ Paratyphi A cases is of concern and suggests the implication of a common and persistent source. This could be either a continuing disseminating source (i.e. water) or a continuing point source such as a food vehicle. Consumption of food from street vendors has been found to be an independent risk factor for acquisition of paratyphoid fever in other Asian countries, e.g. Nepal and Indonesia [13,14]. Of note, we observed also a 2-fold increase of infections due to _S._ Typhi. Given the fact that predominantly adolescents and adults visit our hospital, more data on the possible spread of paratyphoid fever among Cambodian children are certainly needed.

Our findings coincide with the observation of increased numbers of _S._ Paratyphi A infection among European travellers from France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom returning from Cambodia, as communicated in a rapid risk assessment by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on 4 Sep 2013 [1]. Cases from France are described in detail by Tourdjman and colleagues in this issue of Eurosurveillance [15].

Of note, most _S._ Paratyphi A isolated in Cambodia between 2011 and 2013, and from travellers in 2013, displayed low resistance levels for most commonly used antibiotics, in contrast with _S._ Typhi and other Gram-negative pathogens in Cambodia studied between 2007 and 2010 [7]. To enable a more refined resistance description, we plan further batch-tested determination of the minimal inhibitory concentrations for ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and azithromycin amongst other antibiotics.

Further in-depth epidemiological research and a comparative analysis of clonal relationships between the Cambodian and European isolates are warranted to identify the source of the outbreak. Both findings, those in Cambodian citizens and European travellers, suggest that the "hotspot" of this outbreak may be located in Phnom Penh, home to over a million inhabitants and a major gateway for visitors to the country.

Our findings were shared with the Ministry of Health of Cambodia to allow the initiation of in-depth epidemiological investigations in order to organise the required public health measures. Cambodia, like many other low- and middle-income countries, is still building up its microbiological diagnostic capacity; across the country, less than 15 microbiology laboratories are in function [8]. In these settings, even small-scale clinical laboratories, such as the one in our hospital, may play an important role as sentinels for emerging pathogens and resistance patterns.

[Paratyphoid fever is similar to typhoid fever in that both are enteric fever types of disease, although the former can be, but is not necessarily, less severe. The paratyphoid salmonellas are divided into A, B and, rarely now, C _Salmonella paratyphi_, also referred to as _S. enterica_ serotype Paratyphi. Types B and C also have species, now serotypes, _schottmuelleri_ and _hirschfeldii_, respectively. Like typhoid, paratyphoid is generally considered not to be a zoonosis, with [only] humans as the reservoir, but the paratyphoid bacillus has been isolated from domestic animals and fish.

In India, paratyphoid A has become an increasing problem, accounting for up to 45 percent of cases of enteric fever in 1998 (1). Although initially quite sensitive to antimicrobials, strains have become more resistant to quinolones; in contrast, _S. typhi_ has manifested resistance for some time.

In a report regarding differential risk factors for typhoid and paratyphoid in Indonesia, the authors found that the infections seemed to have distinct routes of transmission (2). Typhoid was associated with factors within a household (recent case in the house, no soap for handwashing, sharing of food from the same plate, no toilet in the house), whereas paratyphoid was associated with sources outside the household, such as food from street vendors and flooding.
