On 31 Dec 2008, The Ministry of Health (MoH), Guinea reported 2 laboratory
confirmed cases of yellow fever in the health district of Faranah. Both
cases were reported by the yellow fever surveillance system and presented
with symptoms of fever and jaundice. The initial case was a 40 year old man
from Faranah Koura, and the 2nd case was another 40 year old man from the
sector of Nianfourando; both localities belong to Faranah centre area. The
onset of symptoms for both cases was the beginning of November 2008.

The cases were confirmed at the WHO Collaborating Centre for Yellow Fever,
the Pasteur Institute, Dakar, Senegal, where differential diagnosis for
other hemorrhagic fevers was carried out. In addition, another 21 clinical
cases of suspected yellow fever were reported, 3 of whom died. On the basis
of the outbreak investigation, a reactive mass vaccination campaign,
planned for 26 Jan 2009 and targeting 60 485 people, will be carried out in
some strategic areas in the health district of Faranah. The MoH has made a
request for yellow fever vaccines for the mass vaccination campaign from
the GAVI-funded Global Emergency Stockpile for Yellow Fever Vaccine,
managed by the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for
Yellow Fever Control (YF-ICG).

[These 2 cases appear to be different from the 2 earlier cases reported
from N'zerekore in the extreme south of Guinea, close to the borders of
Liberia & Cote d'Ivoire (ProMED archive no. 20080929.3079 posted on 29 Sep
2008) and distant from Faranah. It is hoped that the reactive mass
vaccination effort has been swift and complete enough to prevent additional
cases.
