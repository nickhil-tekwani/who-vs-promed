More than a year before a medical scope infected patients with a superbug at UCLA [University of California Los Angeles] and Cedars-Sinai medical centers, a similar outbreak in the Netherlands prompted Dutch regulators to ask the manufacturer to prove the device was safe.

Olympus Corp. failed to demonstrate a safe cleaning procedure, according to a new report. As a result, the Dutch hospital that suffered the outbreak, which sickened 22 patients, abandoned the scope for another model without the troublesome design.

The case shows how American regulators and hospitals were left in the dark even as regulators elsewhere concluded that the scopes may be impossible to use and clean safely.

It wasn't until the Los Angeles Times broke the news of the UCLA outbreak in February [2015] that US regulators warned hospitals about the company's device. By that time, hospitals across the country had experienced outbreaks -- some of them deadly. At UCLA's Ronald Reagan Medical Center, 2 patients died and 5 others were sickened.

The report, written by doctors at the Rotterdam hospital, details their investigation into the 2012 outbreak. Like the recent outbreaks in Los Angeles, the Dutch hospital said it cleaned the device according to the company's instructions. But it didn't help: The scope still transferred dangerous bacteria [a carbapenemase-producing _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_] from patient to patient.

In a separate outbreak in Germany, a dozen patients were infected with the same bacteria as in UCLA's, also tied to Olympus scopes.

As a result of the Dutch outbreak, Olympus sent an urgent warning to European hospitals in January 2013, telling them to use a special brush in cleaning the device. The company did not send that letter to US hospitals.

The Dutch doctors' report is the 1st full account of the outbreak. The Times reported last month [April 2015] about the company's European safety alert, but the alert provided no details about what happened or where. The US Food and Drug Administration [FDA], which regulates the safety of medical devices, says it did not learn until last year [2014] of the company's European alert or the Dutch regulators' report.

The Rotterdam hospital, Erasmus University Medical Center, last used the popular Olympus scope, known as model TJF-Q180V, in March 2012. That's when doctors at the hospital traced the outbreak's cause to the scope and brought in the country's regulators.

All 22 Dutch patients had a procedure involving the scope. And the same dangerous strain of bacteria that sickened them was also found living inside the scope's intricate recesses.

Mark Miller, a spokesman for Olympus, said the company had cooperated with regulators in the investigation of the Dutch outbreak. He said the company sent the January 2013 European safety alert to remind hospitals of the importance of properly cleaning the scope.

Miller did not answer a question from The Times about why the company did not send the same alert to American hospitals.

In an email [Wed 6 May 2015], an FDA spokeswoman said the agency believes the TJF-Q180V can be safely used when hospitals follow revised cleaning instructions that Olympus sent to hospitals after the Los Angeles outbreaks.

The FDA first warned hospitals [19 Feb 2015] about the hard-to-clean design of the scope sold by Olympus and 2 other manufacturers.

The agency has scheduled a [Thu 14 May 2015] meeting to discuss the scope-related outbreaks and what more should be done. Among its questions for doctors on an advisory panel is whether the agency should more quickly warn the public when there are concerns about a device, even when there's not enough evidence to pinpoint the specific danger.

The Dutch doctors' report appeared in the medical journal Endoscopy on [31 Mar 2015] [1]. They also presented their findings at an international medical conference in Washington, DC, in September 2014 -- a month before the 1st patient at UCLA became infected.

About the same time that the Dutch report appeared, German doctors published their investigation into a nearly identical outbreak at a hospital in Berlin [2]. The German physicians also blamed the hard-to-clean design of the TJF-Q180V for the outbreak that happened in late 2012 and early 2013.

In all, 12 German patients were infected by the same superbug as those at UCLA and Cedars-Sinai. The outbreak at Berlin's Charite University hospital ended when doctors sent the scope to Olympus for maintenance.

Olympus began selling its redesigned device, the TJF-Q180V, in 2010. In sales brochures, the company said the new design allowed for "more efficient reprocessing" -- the industry's term for disinfecting a device and readying it for the next patient. But the new design actually hampered disinfection, the Dutch doctors wrote in their article. In the new design, Olympus enclosed the scope's elevator channel, which enables doctors to move small instruments through the long snake-like device.

Known as duodenoscopes, the devices are flexible lighted tubes that are threaded through a patient's mouth to the top of the small intestine. They are used to treat problems in the pancreas and bile ducts.

The Dutch doctors had the scope dismantled, finding that the O-ring, which was meant to help seal the elevator channel, had become cracked and worn even though it had been sent to Olympus for repair twice in 13 months. The Dutch doctors, led by Dr Margreet Vos, a microbiologist, and Dr Marco Bruno, a gastroenterologist, said they wrote their report because they wanted to alert other hospitals of the scope's dangerous design.

They called for any "new features" on a device to be tested and proved safe before they were sold. The doctors also called for stringent rules that would require device-related infections to be quickly reported and closely followed to provide an early warning of problems.

The Dutch doctors said it was possible that the scope could transfer not just bacteria, but other pathogens including blood-borne viruses such as hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and HIV.

They said they were particularly concerned the scope could have spread hepatitis B because the hospital treats a high number of those patients. But they said they found no evidence that the scope passed along that virus. They also noted that other researchers have said the risk of endoscopes spreading blood-borne viruses is low.

[The news report above cites 2 outbreaks, in addition to the outbreaks in the US, of infections or intestinal colonization due to carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli related to specialized endoscopes used for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): one in the Netherlands in 2012 due to VIM-2-producing _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ (1) and another in Germany in 2012-2013 due to a OXA-48 -- producing _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ (2). In the outbreak in Germany, there was additional dissemination of the organism to patients who had not undergone ERCP. OXA (oxacillin-hydrolyzing carbapenemases) and VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamases) are enzymes that destroy carbapenem antibiotics and, in addition, most other beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins.

Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that includes ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems, historically antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, have now become compromised by the spread of these carbapenemases.

The news report emphasizes that a medical device with updated features must be retested and proven safe before the device is put into clinical use; there should also be post-marketing surveillance for device-related problems; and any problem should be quickly reported and an early warning of problems should be widely disseminated to those concerned.

Abstract
--------
Background and study aims: Infections are a recognized risk of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). This paper reports on a large outbreak of VIM-2-producing _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ that was linked to the use of a recently introduced duodenoscope with a specific modified design (Olympus TJF-Q180V).

Methods: Epidemiological investigations and molecular typing were executed in order to identify the source of the outbreak. Audits on implementation of infection control measures were performed. Additional infection control strategies were implemented to prevent further transmission. The design and the ability to clean and disinfect the duodenoscope were evaluated, and the distal tip was dismantled.

Results: From January to April 2012, 30 patients with a VIM-2-positive _P. aeruginosa_ were identified, of whom 22 had undergone an ERCP using a specific duodenoscope, the TJF-Q180V. This was a significant increase compared with the hospital-wide baseline level of 2-3 cases per month. Clonal relatedness of the VIM-2 _P. aeruginosa_ was confirmed for all 22 cases and for the VIM-2 strain isolated from the recess under the forceps elevator of the duodenoscope. An investigational study of the new modified design, including the dismantling of the duodenoscope tip, revealed that the fixed distal cap hampered cleaning and disinfection, and that the O-ring might not seal the forceps elevator axis sufficiently. The high monthly number of cases decreased below the pre-existing baseline level following withdrawal of the TJF-Q180V device from clinical use.

Conclusions: Duodenoscope design modifications may compromise microbiological safety as illustrated by this outbreak. Extensive pre-marketing validation of the reprocessability of any new endoscope design and stringent post-marketing surveillance are therefore mandatory.

Abstract
--------
Background: Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) have become a major problem for healthcare systems worldwide. While the first reports from European hospitals described the introduction of CPE from endemic countries, there is now a growing number of reports describing outbreaks of CPE in European hospitals. Here we report an outbreak of carbapenem-resistant _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ in a German University hospital [Charite - University Medicine Berlin], which was in part associated to duodenoscopy.

Findings: Between [6 Dec 2012] and [10 Jan 2013], carbapenem-resistant _K. pneumoniae_ (CRKP) was cultured from 12 patients staying on 4 different wards. The amplification of carbapenemase genes by multiplex PCR showed presence of the bla OXA-48 gene. Molecular typing confirmed the identity of all 12 isolates. Reviewing the medical records of CRKP cases revealed that there was a spatial relationship between 6 of the cases which were located on the same wards. The remaining 6 cases were all related to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) which was performed with the same duodenoscope. The outbreak ended after the endoscope was sent to the manufacturer for maintenance.

Conclusions: Though the outbreak strain was also disseminated to patients who did not undergo ERCP and environmental sources or medical personnel also contributed to the outbreak, the gut of colonized patients is the main source for CPE. Therefore, accurate and stringent reprocessing of endoscopic instruments is extremely important, which is especially true for more complex instruments like the duodenoscope (TJF-Q180V series) involved in the outbreak described here.
