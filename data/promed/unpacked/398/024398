Suspected human case of avian influenza (H5N1) virus infection in South Jakarta
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Livestock and Fishery Sub-service of South Jakarta stopped about 17
[of] 26 units trucks [transporting] chicken meat from outside
Jakarta. These 17 chicken meat trucks could not show animal health
certificates.

This action, Healthy Chicken Transport Operation (Operasi
Transportasi Ayam Sehat/OTAS), was carried out at Jl. Raya Kebayoran
Lama and Jl. Ciledug Raya. In particular in the case of Kebayoran
Lama, the trucks were carrying chicken carcass to be delivered to
traditional markets, said Chaidir Taufik an official of Livvestock
and Fishery Service of South Jakarta. The number of bird carcasses
loaded in those 26 trucks [amounted to] about 19 180 chickens and 800
ducks, [despatched] from Subang, Bogor, Serpong and Sukabumi. The
OTAS action was [undertaken] to [prevent] bird flu outbreaks in
Jakarta, in particular South Jakarta.

Chaidir also mentioned, the OTAS action was [connected with] the
death of a suspected bird flu [avian influenza (H5N1)] patient. The
victim, a resident of Jl. Pengadegan Barat V, died on 26 Jan 2010 in
Pasar Rebo hospital. It was reported that the victim had brought 4
chickens from Cibitung Tangerang [in the previous] month. One chicken
was slaughtered and then victim developed sickness in the following
days. The victim was then treated and tested positive for bird flu
[avian influenza (H5N1) virus] infection. The remaining three
chickens were sent back to Cibitung.

[Reports of human cases of avian influenza (H5N1) virus infection
published in the local media in Indonesia are rarely if ever
confirmed. According to the the WHO Table of human cases of avian
influenza (H5N1) virus infection, updated to 28 Jan 2010, no cases
have been confirmed during 2010, and only 20 throughout 2009 (see:
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2010_01_28/en/index.html>).
Official confirmation of the 2010 South Jakarta case is awaited.
