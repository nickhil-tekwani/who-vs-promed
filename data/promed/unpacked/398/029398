It seems that the porcine Nipah virus problem may still loom over us all in
SE Asia. Recent reports suggest that there may even still be transmission
among pigs, though final data on this are not yet back from reference
laboratories in Australia. What is worrisome is that we know very little
about natural hosts for this paramyxovirus that killed over 100 humans and
resulted in culling of over one million pigs in Malaysia; almost killing
the industry. Hopes that this virus can be contained at international
borders, just by stopping pig imports, may not be justified. This is
particularly true if there are bat or bird natural vectors, which is quite
possible. Pork is an even more important food item in Thailand, Burma,
Cambodia and Vietnam than in Malaysia and appearance of the virus there
would be devastating.
It might be high time for animal vaccine researchers and manufacturers to
develop at least a vaccine for pig farmers. Is this being done?

[We remind our readers once again that there is no solid evidence of Nipah
virus transmission at this time. Nonetheless, Nipah virus certainly causes
a serious disease in both humans and pigs and it is awful to think what
might happen if the virus escapes from Malaysia. It is not at all clear
that Nipah virus is restricted to Malaysia alone but may be an Asian virus.
It also is fairly clear at this point that the natural vertebrate hosts
(reservoirs) of Nipah virus are bats; on-going studies indicate that bats
are naturally infected with this virus. To make matters even more
confusing, two other paramyxoviruses (i.e., members of the family
Paramyxoviridae), very newly recognized, have been isolated from bats in
Malaysia and there already were two bat paramyxoviruses known in Australia,
Hendra and Menangle viruses. So, now there are at least four, possibly
five bat paramyxoviruses in Australasia, at least three of them are capable
of causing human illnesses, and at least two of the five have been known to
cause illness in pigs. At present, there is no evidence that birds are
involved in the natural cycles of the viruses.
Henry also remarked on the need for a vaccine for pig farmers, and perhaps
for others. I know of no on-going work that has such an intended end. The
only rumors I have heard about a vaccine have involved Canadian Government
facilities. Given the risks of spread of this highly pathogenic virus, it
may be time that a public discussion was begun and plans made for the
production and testing of such a vaccine. - Mod.CHC
