Fish deaths in Dunkirk Harbor leave officials looking for cause
---------------------------------------------------------
The [New York] state Department of Environmental Conservation isn't sure
what has left a large number of dead fish in Dunkirk Harbor. Hundreds, if
not thousands, of gizzard shad -- 12 inch [30cm] long fish that feed on
small invertebrates and phytoplankton and are in turn eaten by larger sport
fish -- have been found dead or dying in the harbor over the past several
weeks.
Don Einhouse, senior fisheries biologist for the DEC in Dunkirk, said it's
the largest shad die-off he has seen in the harbor in 20 years. "There's a
lot more carcasses around than we see in an average winter," he said.
Einhouse said workers have sent some of the fish to a laboratory at Cornell
University to determine exactly what killed them and expect to have more
information in a few weeks. There are a number of possibilities, Einhouse
said, but the 2 main suspects are a virus or stress brought on by a long
winter. It's possible the die-off might be related to the emergence of
viral hemorrhagic septicemia [VHS] in New York waters, he said. Although
the virus has no impact on humans, VHS has been blamed for other fish kills
across the Great Lakes. Einhouse said the stress of a long winter also may
have weakened the fish enough to cause the die-off.
He also said that the shad population in Dunkirk Harbor has increased and
that it is possible the larger numbers of the fish make the die-off seem
larger.
The Great Lakes are at the northern edge of the fish's habitat, and they
are attracted to the harbor because hot water discharged from the Dunkirk
power plant makes the harbor warmer than surrounding waters. Einhouse said
2 technicians surveyed the harbor on Tuesday and reported that the die-off
seems to be waning. As Dunkirk's commissioner of public works, Tony Gugino
is in charge of the city's public waterfront areas. He doesn't think the
situation is that unusual. "It's not as bad as they make it sound, like the
whole harbor is covered," he said. "It's not."
He said that he dispatched workers to clean up dead fish along the boat
launch and that they returned with only a couple of garbage bags of dead fish.

Hundreds of dead fish in Lake Erie harbor
-----------------------------------------
Hundreds of fish have been found dead and dying in Lake Erie's Dunkirk
Harbor, and conservation officials suspect either a virus or stress from
the long winter. Don Einhouse, senior fisheries biologist for the state
Department of Environmental Conservation in Dunkirk [NY], said it's the
largest shad die-off he has seen in the harbor in 20 years. Some of the
gizzard shad -- 12 inch fish that feed on small invertebrates and
phytoplankton and are in turn eaten by larger sportfish -- have been sent
to a lab at Cornell University to determine what killed them.
The die-off could be from the emergence of viral hemorrhagic septicemia in
New York waters, he said. The virus has no impact on humans but has been
blamed for other fish kills in the Great Lakes, including eastern Lake
Ontario. Officials said the die-off appeared to be waning.

Dunkirk is on the Lake Erie shore. ProMED-mail post 20070501.1418 reported
that viral hemorrhagic septicemia has already been diagnosed in other
regions of Lake Erie. This may be the same. We look forward to finding out
the lab results. - Mod.TG]
