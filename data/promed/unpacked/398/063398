Bluetongue (BT) [has become] further established [in Italy], namely in Lazio and the southern region of Calabria. A total of 326 sheep have perished, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) updates [see comment].

Bluetongue has not become a problem in northern Italy, but in central and southwest Italy, the problem is rife. The disease is affecting sheep, cattle and goat farms.

[BTV-1 has been circulating in mainland Italy, along the western coastal regions, since late September 2013. The most recent follow-up report (No. 18) has been submitted on 2 Sep 2014, notifying 84 new outbreaks (see, with interactive map, at http://tinyurl.com/nwxfhqp).

The following OIE statistics cover the accumulated data since the start of the epizootic on 29 Sep 2013, as of 2 Sep 2014:

Outbreak summary: Total outbreaks = 136 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 6532 / 162 / 0 / 2 / 0
Sheep / 41 906 / 2548 / 682 / 6 / 0
Goats / 639 / 3 / 0 / 0 / 0
Buffaloes / 56 / 4 / 0 / 0 / 0

Probably, the virus was introduced to mainland Italy from Sardinia, where it had caused outbreaks during 2012 and 2013 (see posting 20121030.1377648 and http://genomea.asm.org/content/2/1/e00093-14.short). According to media reports, almost 10 000 died from BT in Sardinia during 2012 (posting 20130127.1517285).

According to the OIE reports, vaccination against BT is not allowed in Italy. - Mod.AS
