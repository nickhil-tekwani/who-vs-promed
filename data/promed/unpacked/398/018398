Their locations are indicated on the OIE map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=14668.

The same virus was reported on 11 Apr 2014 from a single outbreak in southwest Japan; stamping-out and quarantine measures were applied and no spread has been observed. The disease in South Korea was suspected to have been introduced by migratory birds (Baikal teals).
