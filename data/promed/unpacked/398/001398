Florida soybean rust is back on kudzu, not traveling yet
-----------------------------------------------
Asian soybean rust is active again on kudzu in Gadsden County, Florida,
even through the state is still quite dry. Officials think several nights
of dew may have been enough for germination.
Jim Marois, University of Florida professor of plant pathology, reported
today [9 Jun 2006] that: "We are having local showers, but overall the
state is still very dry. Yesterday [8 Jun 2006], we once again found
soybean rust on kudzu in Gadsden County. This is the site in the panhandle
of Florida that was positive in January 2006 then negative during February
2006 after freezing weather, positive again in March 2006 when it warmed
up, then negative again in April and May 2006 when we got dry. What is
interesting is that the severity was moderate; a lot of leaves had several
lesions. This may mean the rust, since we have had little rain, is getting
its water for germination from dew, which we have had overnight for several
days. The Florida kudzu canopy is fully developed, and flowering has begun
in several areas. All of the soybean sentinel plots are still negative,
with several plots having the MGIII starting to bloom (R1-R2). All kudzu
monitoring sites and sentinel plots are being visited weekly."
Don Hershman, University of Kentucky Extension plant pathologist, commented
as he forwarded Marois's report to a soybean rust listserv: "Here is a
brief soybean rust update from Florida," Hershman wrote. "You will see that
things have changed very little, but there is some new activity. There is
no evidence at this time that soybean rust is on the brink of significant
new activity anywhere in the U.S. At least that is my take on things."

[Asian soybean rust (ASR) is a plant disease caused by the fungus
_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_. It was introduced into the USA in 2004. In
addition to the crop plant soybean (_Glycine max_), cowpeas, green beans,
and other edible legumes could be affected by the ASR pathogen, which
causes defoliation and yield reduction. Kudzu (_Pueraria lobata_, a.k.a.
Japanese arrowroot) is an important alternate host for the pathogen in
southern states of the USA.
This is the 1st new report of ASR in the USA since 17 May 2006, when, after
a month of no reports during February 2006, some positive finds of ASR on
kudzu in the northern part of the state of Florida were noted
(20060518.1402). A dry period in Florida then followed. There have still
been no reports of ASR on soybean in the 2006 crop, either in production
fields or experimental sentinel plots. By mid June 2005, ASR had been
reported on both soybean and Kudzu in Florida and Georgia (20050309.0693,
20050429.1196).
Since the last update, 2 additional news articles have caught my attention,
one described the use of PCR as a rapid and sensitive test that can detect
ASR on tissues before signs of the pathogen or symptoms of the disease
appear. This could have an important role to play in the management of the
disease. The 2nd described improvements to the Sbrusa.net site to help
growers process the information they need to manage ASR. Links to these
reports are provided in "Recent links on ASR:"
