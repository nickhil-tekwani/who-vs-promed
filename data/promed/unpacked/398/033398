At least 6 children have died so far in February [2011] after being
bitten by hematophagous [blood feeding], rabies-infected bats in 2
native communities in the Amazonas region of Peru, the Ministry of
Health (MINSA) announced today [16 Feb 2011]. The victims, between 1
and 14 years [of age], belong to the San Ramon and Yupicusa native
communities in Bagua province, near the border with Ecuador, some 1000
km [620 mi] north of Lima, in an area inhabited by Guaruna, Awajun,
and Wampi ethnic groups in the Amazonas region.

"We have reports of 6 dead children due to an outbreak of sylvatic
rabies in the region," said Dr Peter Quintanilla, director of health
of Chachapoyas, capital of Amazonas [Region]. Quintanilla stated that
3 victims came to the Bagua Hospital with fever, myalgia, and
convulsions, while the other 3 lost their lives under treatment by
traditional folk healers. "We have difficulty attending ill
individuals because the indigenous people attribute the problem to
witchcraft and go first to witches (folk healers) on the border with
Ecuador to be healed," the physician said. In the 2 indigenous
communities, with a population of 1055 native [people], it is reported
that at least 200 children have histories of having been bitten by
[vampire] bats, according to the official.

The rabies outbreak has been confirmed by capture of some [vampire
bat] specimens infected by this disease [virus].

Vaccination brigades have been sent urgently to attend these affected
populations, located in remote areas reached by trips of 15 hours on
rivers in the rainforest.

In 2010, at least 20 people, including children and adults, died in
the Amazonas region from [vampire] bat [transmitted] rabies.

[Dwellings in these types of villages are usually open, making for
easy access by vampire bats to feed on people asleep when preferred
hosts (cattle and horses) are unavailable. Of the 3 species of vampire
bats in South America, the most common is _Desmodus rotundus_, which
is most likely responsible for rabies virus transmission in these
cases. An image can be accessed at
