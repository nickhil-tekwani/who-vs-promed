Malaria control campaign started in Kyrgyzstan
-----------------------------------------------
A malaria prevention information campaign has been initiated in
Kyrgyzstan, said Nurbolot Usenbaev, manager of the project. According
to him, 330 cases were registered during 2006, including 125 cases in Bishkek.
Doctors are concerned over a worsening epidemic situation during the
spring in the southern regions of the republic and in the capital
city [Bishkek]. Healthcare workers have been stockpiling drugs and
diagnostics. In case of malaria, patients can get free drugs in
healthcare facilities, which are for a 17-day treatment course, the
representative of the State department of sanitary and
epidemiological control of the Ministry of Health, Zuridin Nurmatov, said.
In the capital of Kyrgyzstan, the Ala-Archinsk water reservoir of the
Chuysk region remains the main source of mosquito breeding.
Inhabitants of the newly built districts of Kalis Ordo and Ak Bosogo
are at risk, as they are near the reservoir.
The director of the Republican center for health promotion of the
Ministry of Health said that in the coming months, all water bodies
of Bishkek and the Jalal-Abad region will be stocked with gambusia,
small fish that eat the larvae of mosquitoes. To escape the
mosquitoes, doctors recommend avoiding water reservoirs and using repellents.

[Malaria is endemic in Kyrgyzstan. However, during 2002, morbidity
decreased 10-fold. During the previous 10-15 years, morbidity had
increased, reaching 3000 cases per year due to an influx of migrants
from Tajikistan and Afghanistan. Due to the joint efforts of
republican and international agencies, the malaria situation became
stable. Nevertheless, some problem regions remain, particularly
Oshskaya, Batkenskaya, and Jalal-Abadskaya regions and the city of
Bishkek. See:

[The WHO Regional Office for Europe reports: "Malaria was eradicated
in Kyrgyzstan in 1959; however, from 1986 onwards, as a result of the
importation of malaria by military personnel returning from
Afghanistan, a few local cases were registered annually. In the years
to follow and up to 1995, only imported cases were reported in the
country. In 1996, the 1st case of autochthonous malaria was
registered in the Panfilov district. From that point forward, there
has been a rise in the number of autochthonous malaria cases.
In 2002, the explosive resumption of malaria transmission produced an
epidemic situation with an incidence much greater than that reported
in the past years in Kyrgyzstan, and a total of 2267 autochthonous
_P. vivax_ cases were reported in the southwestern regions of the
country, including Batken, Osh and Jalal-Abad.
This explosive resumption of malaria transmission in Kyrgyzstan was a
result of the immigration of a number of infected people from
Tajikistan into the Batken region, where the _Anopheles_ vector
exists and conditions for malaria transmission are very favorable. In
2004-2005, as a result of the application of epidemic control
measures, there was a significant decrease in the reported number of
autochthonous malaria cases (42 in 2005). However, in 2004, the 1st
autochthonous case of _P. falciparum_ malaria was reported in the
Aravan district of the southern part of Kyrgyzstan, in an area
bordering Uzbekistan, and in 2005 the number of autochthonous cases
of _P. vivax_ malaria increased in the outskirts of Bishkek, the
capital of the country.
Malaria vectors in the country include _An. pulcherimus_, _An.
superpictus_, _An. hyrcanus_, _An. martinius_, _An. claviger_ &_An.
messeae_. Studies on vector resistance to different insecticides have
revealed that all the above-mentioned species are susceptible to DDT,
fenitrothion, cyfluthrin, deltamethrin, malathion, lamba-cyhalothrine
and propoxur." See
