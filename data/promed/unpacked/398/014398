Since 1 Jan 2022, 6 cases of botulism with 10 victims have been registered in Armenia, according to the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the RA Ministry of Health. Taking into account the severe course of the disease, in order to avoid further complications, the RA Ministry of Health urges the following:

- Avoid homemade canned food.
- Heat homemade canned food by boiling it for 20-25 minutes before using it.
- Do not buy homemade canned food from the market or random individuals.
- See a doctor immediately as soon as the 1st symptoms appear.

The main symptoms of botulism are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, shortness of breath, obstruction of the act of aspiration, and unilateral paralysis. These symptoms appear 2-3 hours to 10 days after eating the affected food.

Botulism is a severe food poisoning caused by [toxins produced by the bacterium] _Clostridium botulinum_. The pathogen is found in the external environment, as spores, from where it spreads to vegetables and greens. Low oxygen, low acid conditions are required for the growth and development of this pathogen, where it reproduces and produces toxin. Such conditions are created in hermetically sealed cans. Destruction of the pathogen is possible only in special devices, under the influence of high pressure (1.5-2 atmospheres), and adequate heat (120-130 deg C / 248-266 deg F) in autoclaves, which are available only in canning companies. These conditions may not be easily met at home.

Food affected by botulism does not change its taste, smell, color, or appearance.

[It is not clear if any of these cases diagnosed in 2022 were related to the home-canned cucumbers that were reported in late 2021 in Armenia.

The neurological symptoms of botulism with cranial nerve findings and flaccid paralysis, which can culminate in respiratory failure, can be mimicked by other diseases; a cluster of such cases is almost always due to intoxication with one of the types of botulinum toxin. Although classically foodborne from ingestion of preformed toxin from inadequate preparation, botulism can also be linked to ingestion of environmental spores, especially in infants, as well as related to unsterile injections in illicit drug users. - Mod.LL
