The number of residents of Kampung Baru Sung-kap Para affected by the
chikungunya outbreak has increased to 32. State health director Datuk
Dr Hasnah Ismail said 5 more villagers (3 men and 2 women) were
admitted to Sultan Abdul Halim Hospital on Sunday [14 Dec 2008]. They
were admitted after they were found to have fever, joint pains, and
rashes, which are symptoms of chikungunya [virus infection].

All 32 patients have been transferred to Sungai Petani Hospital near
the Kuala Muda District Health Department [in Sungai Petani]. "The
transfer of the patients to the old hospital will enable our medical
staff to continue to monitor and conduct checks on the victims. I
would like to stress that all patients are in a stable condition."

She said at the moment, the health department had only received
reports on chikungunya from residents of Kampung Baru Sungkap Para.

[The suspected chikungunya outbreak in this area appears to be
intensifying. The previous report (see ProMED-mail archive no.
20081214.3929) cited a published report quoting Dr Hasnah Ismail who
said 84 villagers from 15 houses had been checked, 16 were found to
have fever, joint pains, and headaches, and 8 were admitted to Sultan
Abdul Halim Hospital for further treatment. The number of
hospitalized villagers has now reached 32. There is no indication
that chikungunya virus has been laboratory confirmed in these cases,
although the clinical picture is compatible with infection by that
virus and the virus has been circulating in other parts of peninsular
Malaysia this year (2008).
