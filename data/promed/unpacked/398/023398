Public Health physicians are alarmed that the incidence of HFRS
(hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, also known locally as mouse
fever) is 90 times greater than the average for this time of year.

The press office of the Regional Rospotrebnadzor (health protection
agency) announced that there had been 60 cases of HFRS in the
Ashinsky region between November 2009 and January 2010. This is 3
times the incidence in the same territory in 2008. The increase is
attributed to the severe weather of the recent winter, which has
induced small rodents to move into human habitations.

Rodent control measures are being discussed, and the use of "Tsunami"
is a favoured option. Rospotrebnadzor states that rodent control has
become obligatory, and, if it is not implemented immediately, the
incidence of HFRS in the human population will rise. The public is
being advised to wear personal protective gear while working in
gardens, holiday homes, and basements, especially when there is
evidence of the presence of rodents. The carcasses of dead rodents
should be burned as a protective measure.

[HFRS in Russia is caused predominantly by the hantavirus _Pumala
virus_. The control of the rodent population and contact avoidance
are the best prevention. The total of 60 cases in one 3-month period
is a significant morbidity for one region. - Mod.NR]
