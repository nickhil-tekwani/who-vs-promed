After being unemployed for 3 years, a 26 year old man was offered a job at a local bank on the condition that he take a blood test. It was then that he discovered he had been infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), which can cause liver disease and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma -- better known as liver cancer.

The bank consequently withdrew its offer, and the man fell victim to the social stigma associated with hepatitis C and other chronic diseases. In fact, Egypt has the highest prevalence of HCV in the world, with 10-14 per cent (8 to 10 million people) infected with HCV, and about 1.5 million in need of treatment. Gamal Esmat, professor of liver disease at Cairo [University], notes that the vast majority of these are in the Nile Delta region. HCV's high prevalence in Egypt is in part due to a mass state campaign in the 1960s and 1970s to treat schistosomiasis using improperly sterilized glass syringes and needles.

But a new treatment for HCV could radically change the situation. In collaboration with the Ministry of Health and other global organizations, the National Hepatology and Tropical Medicine Research Institute (NHTMRI) plans to introduce a new HCV treatment in 2014. Unlike previous treatments -- antiviral drugs that treat HCV by boosting the immune system -- the new treatment cures the virus within 12 weeks at a 97 per cent effectiveness rate and with no side effects. Known as "direct acting antiviral agents", the new HCV treatment combats the disease by targeting the infected liver cells and destroying the virus' replication machinery.

Abou el-Resh Pediatric University Hospital, Cairo (Ashashyou), Raymond Schinazi, an American research scientist of Italian-Egyptian descent at Atlanta's Emory University, was the founder of Pharmasset Inc, the company that originally developed the drug. Schinazi's team of researchers worked for over 6 years, finding what they consider to be the cure: the PSI-7977 molecule, now named "sofosbuvir", which the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved on 8 Dec [2013].

The "silent epidemic"
---------------------
Born and raised in Alexandria, Schinazi and his family left Egypt during the large-scale Jewish exodus that took place in the 1950s and 1960s. Schinazi says he still has a close relationship with Egypt and hopes his collaborative research will eventually help cure those infected in his country of birth. "When I 1st heard of HCV, I thought to myself: This is my next target," he says. "My dream was to one day find a cure for it and help my mother country," says Schinazi, who sold his company and the drug patent to US company Gilead Sciences for USD 11.4 billion.

There are currently over 6 drug companies competing for the production of an HCV cure. But unlike the other drugs in the market, sofosbuvir is also pan-genotypic, which means that it can be used to treat infected people with all [known HCV] genotypes worldwide -- including genotype 4, which is most common in Egypt.

Dubbed the "silent epidemic", hepatitis C has infected about 170 million people worldwide and has caused about 350 000 deaths per year from HCV-related diseases. "Our aim is to provide a treatment for HCV which is safe, effective and with minimal side effects," says Manal al-Sayed, professor of pediatrics at Ain Shams University and a member of the National Committee for the Control of Viral Hepatitis. "Our challenge will be to have it at affordable prices for all," she adds. With prospects of the cure costing as much as USD 100 000 in the US, many are concerned it would be unaffordable for most Egyptians. Egyptian authorities, doctors, Ministry of Health members and others are currently negotiating with major pharmaceutical companies producing this and other treatments to reduce costs. Nevertheless, Egyptian authorities and doctors remain hopeful of bringing HCV treatment to Egypt at 5 per cent of the global price, with the rest subsidised by government authorities.

[Hepatitis C is bloodborne, and symptoms are often not visible until 20 years after infection. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting for a few weeks to a serious, lifelong condition that can lead to cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer -- despite treatment and the likelihood of a total cure looking promising in the near future. Therefore more attention must be focused on preventing the infection process of hepatitis C virus infection.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), almost 20 per cent of the Health Ministry's budget has been allocated to care and treatment and just a 1 per cent expenditure on infection control. In Egypt, there are approximately 165 000 new cases of infection each year, and 70 per cent of them are related to inefficiencies of the health care system. For example, equipment is often not sterilized according to acceptable standards, and infection is very often transmitted through improperly screened blood transfusions of infected patients. Other modes of infection include the sharing of unsterilized needles and unsterilized tools for pedicures, manicures and tattoos. However over the past 6 years, there have also been extensive campaigns to raise awareness about hepatitis C virus infection. WHO says Egypt is one of only 2 developing countries that provide free universal treatment for HCV. - Mod.CP
