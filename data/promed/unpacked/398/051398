Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in China (People's Republic of ~)
Emergency report
Information received on 4 Feb 2004 from Dr Shen Zhenzhao, Director General,
Bureau of Animal Husbandry and Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing:
Date of the report: 4 Feb 2004.
Five outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been confirmed
(see Table and map)..
Eighteen other outbreaks are suspected. Samples have been sent to the
National Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 23 Jan 2004.
Description of affected population: poultry, ducks, geese, doves.
Diagnosis:
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was confirmed (27 Jan 2004): National
Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza.
B. Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus type A, subtype H5N1.
Control measures:
- stamping out within a 3-km radius of the outbreaks and suspected outbreaks;
- vaccination within a 5-km radius of the outbreaks and suspected outbreaks
on a compulsory basis.
Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: no outbreaks of
highly pathogenic avian influenza in the People's Republic of China have
been reported before to the OIE. The monthly reports for September,
October, and November 2003 indicate the absence of the disease. To date, no
information for January to August 2003 or for December 2003 has been
received at the OIE Headquarters.

[The table and map referenced in this report are worth looking at. The 23
outbreaks, only 5 confirmed, reported here dot the map of China from West
to East and North to South. As mentioned previously in a very cogent
comment by ProMED-mail Moderator Arnon Shimshony (Avian influenza - Eastern
Asia (20) 20040206.0430), these outbreaks occur in provinces with borders
to 11 other countries and in small holdings that foster the close proximity
of birds, pigs, and people.
The table indicates only 430 511 birds have been culled so far. Thailand by
contrast has culled more than 10 million birds in 17 provinces. Clearly,
the Chinese animal health authorities have a massive job in a potentially
explosive location. It is imperative that global cooperation is maximized
and that we obtain good epidemiologic data, similar to that contained in
this report. Once again, details of the vaccine strain used prior to the
outbreak would be most helpful. - Mod.PC]
