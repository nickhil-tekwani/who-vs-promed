The state government has decided to shift patients with totally drug-resistant tuberculosis (TDR-TB) to a sanatorium in Jaysingpur near Maharashtra's Sangli. A central team of TB experts will assess the patients on Monday [16 Jan 2012] before they leave the city [Mumbai]. State doctors were busy on Saturday [14 Jan 2012] working out quarantine [sic] plans to contain one of the worst health disasters -- the emergence of TDR-TB in Mumbai.

More than a week after a Mumbai doctor chronicled the existence of TDR-TB in 12 patients in Mumbai, Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad flew down on Saturday [14 Jan 2012] for an unrelated meeting that quickly approved of the quarantine plans. Azad told TOI that "the central team will arrive on Monday [16 Jan 2012]. Only after the assessment will we be able to decide the seriousness of the situation."

The patients will be housed in a 30 bed sanatorium at Jaysingpur, a picturesque, small town near Sangli that is relatively pollution-free. "11 of the 14 patients identified with TDR-TB so far in the city will be sent to isolation," said state TB control officer Dr P Gaikwad.

Hinduja Hospital in Mahim had found the TDR-TB bacilli in 12 patients during research in October 2011. One of them died a month later. The hospital has since reported the death of one more patient and the transmission of the bacilli to the mother of a patient. "JJ Hospital in Byculla [a neighbourhood in South Mumbai], too, has seen 2 such patients. One is dead and the other untraceable," said a state official.

[The news report above updates the number of cases of TDR-TB in Mumbai, India: there are now 15 cases that include 2 fatalities. See the prior ProMED-mail post Tuberculosis, TDR - India: (MH, KA) 20120110.1005663.

Infectious diseases that spread from person to person are said to be contagious. Isolation is a term that refers to the separation and restriction of movement of people who are ill with a specific infectious illness that is potentially contagious from those who are healthy to stop the spread of that illness. Quarantine is a term that refers to the separation and restriction of movement of people who, while not yet ill, have been exposed to an infectious agent and therefore may become ill with a contagious disease.
