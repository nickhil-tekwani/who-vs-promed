[The occurrence of classical swine fever (CSF) in wildlife is a clear indication that the disease is actively circulating in the area. In September 2014, Russia reported CSF in the Bryansk Province (this province borders with Belarus and Ukraine); an outbreak was reported in domestic pigs. The event summary and map for this event can be obtained at http://tinyurl.com/mkoak24.

As mentioned by moderator AS in his comment in ProMED-mail post 20140906.2753807: "The apparent absence of CSF in wild boar in the adjacent territories in Belarus and Russia may reflect deficient surveillance or underreporting."
