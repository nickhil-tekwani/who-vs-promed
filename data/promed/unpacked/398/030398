Fresh heroin warning after 2nd London anthrax case
--------------------------------------------------
British health authorities repeated a warning to drug users on Monday
[1 mar 2010] that a batch of heroin contaminated with anthrax was
probably circulating in Europe, posing a potentially serious health threat.

The Health Protection Agency [HPA] said a 2nd case of anthrax had
been confirmed in an injecting heroin user in London, adding to 2
previous cases in England, 24 in Scotland, and one in Germany. A
total of 12 people [England (1), Scotland (10), Germany (1) -
Mod.MHJ] have died in Europe of anthrax infection since the 1st cases
emerged in Scotland in December [2009].

European health authorities said in January [2010] they believed a
batch of heroin was circulating in the region that had been
contaminated with anthrax. Experts have said the heroin is unlikely
to have been deliberately contaminated.

Rachel Heathcock from the London branch of the HPA stressed there was
no evidence of person-to-person transmission in any of the recent
anthrax cases and the risk to the general population, including those
close to infected patients, was "negligible." "It is extremely rare
for anthrax to be spread from person to person," she said in a
statement [it is essentially non-contagious. - Mod.MHJ]

Lindsey Davies, a director of public health for the British capital,
said heroin users needed to be aware of the risks. "I urge all heroin
users in London to be extremely alert to the risks and to seek urgent
medical advice if they experience signs of infection such as redness
or swelling at or near an injection site or other symptoms... such a
high temperature, chills, or a severe headache," she said in a
statement. "This is a very serious infection for drug users," she
added. "Early antibiotic treatment can be lifesaving."

The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which
monitors health in the European Union, said last month [February
2010] that other EU countries may be at risk. "Considering the
complex international distribution chain of heroin and the link among
cases in Scotland and Germany, the exposure to a contaminated batch
of heroin distributed in several EU member states is probable," it
said on its website. But it added that it was also possible the
German and English cases are due to small amounts of heroin
originating from Scotland, "in which case other EU member states than
UK and Germany might not be affected."

If the past months are anything to go by, only England, Scotland, and
Germany are at risk, which is not to say that some of the
contaminated heroin in Scotland has not reached Wales or Ireland;
that there has been a case in Blackpool might suggest that Liverpool,
in between London and Blackpool, might have some of this heroin, and
Liverpool is a port. - Mod.MHJ]
