Measles, Syria (Aleppo), clusters
---------------------------------
In a statement dated 15 Jan 2022, the "Syrian Interim Government" warned of an outbreak of the disease in northwestern Syria, announcing the 1st death of measles in Afrin, a 12-year-old girl.

The statement confirmed the discovery of 30 cases of the disease in the Al-Bab region, and more than one in Afrin, the majority of which were children under 5 years old, in addition to the suspected presence of congenital rubella syndrome in a newborn girl, during the period from December 2021 to 7 Jan 2022.

The Minister of Health in the "interim government," Dr Maram al-Sheikh, said in an interview with Enab Baladi that, until now, it was not known why 2 clusters of infections appeared in 2 specific areas (Al-Bab and Afrin).

Al-Sheikh added that every year, several cases of the disease were recorded, but they were with mild symptoms, and in separate areas, so they did not pose a danger from a public health perspective.

Al-Sheikh believes that the reason for the spread is the emergence of a mutation in the causative virus, which led to the emergence of a new strain, or the failure of some people to adhere to the vaccine, or to forget some doses.

The overall turnout for routine vaccinations was excellent in previous periods, and deaths from measles were only recorded in rare cases, such as what happened this year [2022], according to Al-Sheikh.

He added that the vaccine is routine, and people accept it, but there are complex reasons for the possibility of new infections, and this happens annually, but with light and scattered injuries, and he called on people not to be afraid.

Minister Al-Sheikh explained that the reason for warning of any contagious epidemic that is supposed to be one of the diseases controlled by vaccines, is the emergence of any cluster, or the occurrence of death among those cases.

Investigations are carried out on the presence of mutations, focus on monitoring this epidemic within the community, and conducting a vaccination campaign in addition to routine vaccination, so that the matter is contained from its beginning before it turns into an epidemic.

The Ministry of Health in the "interim government" contacted the vaccination teams to start a campaign to vaccinate all children against measles, according to Al-Sheikh.

The risk of measles spreading in Syria
More than 30 000 suspected cases have been reported in opposition-held areas, according to the BioMed Central report .

[ProMED thanks Dr. Orabi for submitting this report on measles in Aleppo, Syria.

Most likely the fatal case was due to lack of immunity due to incomplete or lack of vaccination but could be due to a change in the virus as suggested in the report. However, if that were the case, one would expect to see more than one severe case. It appears sequencing is being conducted, which will answer that question. We look forward to hearing more about this soon. - Mod.LK

[2] Global vaccine crisis

Another vaccine crisis: rise in missed doses may portend return of measles
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
More than 22 million children worldwide missed their 1st dose of the measles vaccine in 2020, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That is 3 million more than the number of children who missed recommended doses in 2019, representing the largest increase in 20 years.

Measles is a highly contagious disease and high rates of vaccination are required to prevent outbreaks. Approximately 95% of a population needs to be vaccinated against measles in order to achieve herd immunity. So this increase in missed vaccinations and lower rates of outbreak surveillance, which also decreased in 2020, put regional measles elimination at risk, public health leaders say.

In a recent conversation, Sten Vermund, dean of the Yale School of Public Health, and Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health and recent member of the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts' working group on measles and rubella vaccines, spoke to Yale News about the dangerous implications of this trend and what can be done to reverse it.

This interview has been [abridged], condensed, and edited.

Sten Vermund: How concerning is it that such a growing number of children are missing their 1st dose of the measles vaccine?

Saad Omer: It's concerning because we know from experience that these missed doses are not uniformly distributed. They're often in the most under-resourced, most underprivileged, and most vulnerable communities. So, this is concerning, and we need to catch up.

Sten Vermund: Measles, among respiratory viruses, is more serious than most. It has a higher death rate and complication rate, and for those reasons alone, we are alarmed. But the 2nd element that is concerning is that it's more infectious than the other respiratory viruses, including coronavirus. It's simply easier to catch. When you have a diminution of the number of kids who are protected, you can pretty much count on there being outbreaks because the transmission is more robust and, therefore, the protection is more fragile, and we need a very high proportion of children to be vaccinated to achieve the so-called herd immunity.

Saad Omer: What steps need to be taken to get these children vaccinated?

Omer: It's ultimately the country programs that are responsible, but they need a lot of help and support. In certain cases, the WHO, Gavi [the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations], and UNICEF can provide support. It's important to have international attention and investment so countries can mount these catch-up campaigns, especially as COVID-19 restrictions begin to open up.

We also should be mindful that controlling the measles virus globally is in the US interest. We know that there are pockets of vulnerability in this country. There have been increasing outbreaks here. Because of social distancing [due to the COVID-19 crisis], we pushed back the impact of those outbreaks a little bit. But now, as children go back to schools and communities come together again, even this country is at risk of measles outbreaks.

The report listed the 10 countries with the highest number of children with missed 1st doses, and these countries were fairly spread out, geographically. What does that mean for outbreak risk and what are the implications of that for solving the problem?

Vermund: We have to vaccinate against measles, all the kids all the time, and that includes high-income countries. Whenever we have some rumor that autism is caused by the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, and parents in high-income countries stop vaccinating, you start to see measles cases. It's extremely easy to reintroduce measles through travel and to spread measles. It is remarkably transmissible.

And we do have strong national programs -- national programs for vaccines are stronger than national programs for just about any other condition. And so I do think we have the infrastructure to make rapid progress again. It may require a surge of funding, and Gavi, as Saad mentioned, is well positioned to help countries that have vaccine shortages. But I think there is a sense of urgency not only for these 10 priority countries but for many others.

Omer: The breadth of the problem highlights the need for a coordinated regional and global response. We are as strong as the weakest link in the chain of protection against this virus. Research has also shown that the ability to mount immune memory against other pathogens goes down when you are hit with measles. And that effect lasts for a few years. So, we don't want these communities to be hit with a one-two punch of measles and then subsequent infections.

The report also mentions that measles surveillance dipped in 2020. What does proper measles surveillance allow you to do?

Omer: You want to go after outbreaks as soon as possible. You can't have see-no-evil epidemiology with measles; you need to find out if there is a problem and you need to act quickly. Measles is not something you don't find out about. The question is when you find out, and if you find out sooner rather than later, you can have an impact on the trajectory of the outbreak itself.

Interestingly, there were also lower rates of reported measles cases last year [2021] than in the year before. The WHO proposed a few reasons why that might be -- there might actually be fewer cases or maybe cases were underreported. Is there a way to determine the real driver of these numbers?

Vermund: What we try to do is triangulate multiple data sources. We can survey hospitals and find out how many children have died of measles or how many have been hospitalized with measles. Say you're in a region and you've noticed fewer vaccines being given and there have been lockdowns from coronavirus fears. If your case rates for measles drop, your death rates for measles drop, and your hospitalizations from measles drop, then you can be pretty sure that COVID mitigation reduced the number of measles cases, even if measles risk has gone up. However, if your case numbers drop but your mortality goes up and your hospitalization rates go up, you can be pretty sure that measles cases were underreported. So, there are various surveillance tricks that one can apply to try to tease out whether there's been a true reduction in incidence or whether it's an artifact of poor reporting.

Omer: In addition to surveillance itself, there is the fact that physical distancing going on around the world. But when things go back to "normal" and interactions go up, these artificially depressed rates may increase because there's plenty of tinder that can catch fire.
