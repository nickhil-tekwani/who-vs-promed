[This outbreak should serve as a reminder that H5N1 HPAI is still
circulating in some countries with varying degrees of endemicity.
HPAI is certainly not endemic in Cambodia in the same fashion as
Indonesia, but continued outbreaks and reemergence does occur there.
Cambodia has had 4 outbreaks in birds in 2006, one outbreak in 2007,
and one outbreak in 2008, and now this one.

A good summary of the H5N1 situation, as of April 2009, in Southeast
Asia (and the rest of the world) can be found in the FAO/Empress
report "H5N1 HPAI Global Overview - April, 2009 at
<ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/012/ak131e/ak131e00.pdf>. A summary of
the situation in Southeast Asia from this highly informative, concise
document is quoted below:

"The disease remains most active in those countries considered
endemic: Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Indonesia and Viet Nam. The
disease seems to be under control in those countries that experienced
a re-emergence of HPAI over the last few months, namely Cambodia,
India, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Nepal and Thailand. It
remains unknown whether these new cases occurred because of (a)
re-introduction of the infection, or (b) the undetected circulation
of the virus at a low level."

In the October 2009 issue of the FAO/EMPRES publication, the
situation in Cambodia is summarized as "no additional H5N1 HPAI
events have been reported since the human case and poultry outbreak
reported in Kandal Province in December 2008. Cambodia routinely
reports results obtained from surveillance activities through 2
hotlines supported by FAO at the National Veterinary Research
Institute (NaVRI). During October 2009, the hotlines received 46
calls, of which 4 reported sick and dying poultry. After
investigation, they were ruled out as being H5N1 HPAI. There is also
ongoing duck market surveillance in 12 live bird markets in 11
provinces conducted by NaVRI (and supported by FAO) since 2007. None
of the samples collected so far have tested positive for H5N1 HPAI".
See <ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/012/ak715e/ak715e00.pdf>.

A 2nd information source containing the risk mapping across 4
Southeast Asian countries is a paper published in the Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences. This paper by Gilbert et al.
includes the noted medical geographer Dirk Pfeiffer on its author
list and provides a very succinct risk map for Thailand, Cambodia,
Laos and Viet Nam (Figure 4 in the publication). The results of the
risk model are summarized in the abstract as "A consistent pattern
emerges suggesting risk to be associated with duck abundance, human
population, and rice cropping intensity in contrast to a relatively
low association with chicken numbers." For the full article, which
can be read profitably, see
<http://www.eomf.ou.edu/media/docs/EmergingInfectiousDiseases/H5N1_SoutheastAsia_PNAS.pdf>.
