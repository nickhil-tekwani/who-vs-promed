Health officials fighting the pandemic in Africa say they are watching the crisis in India "with total disbelief" and have warned that their continent may face a similar ordeal soon. "What is happening in India cannot be ignored by our continent," John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said last week. "We do not have enough health care workers, we do not have enough oxygen ... We cannot and should not find ourselves in [India's] scenario because of the very fragile nature of our health systems."

Latest statistics underline that so far Africa has escaped the worst of the pandemic. There were nearly 76 000 new Covid-19 infections in the 3rd week of April [2021], while India reported more than 400 000 new cases on [Fri 30 Apr 2021] alone.

But though India, with 1.35 billion people, has a similar population size to the African continent, it has a more robust health system. According to latest World Bank figures, there are almost 4 times more doctors per habitant in India than across Africa. Unlike India, no African country manufactures significant quantities of drugs or vaccines, Nkengasong said.

The warning to increase resources in Africa comes as the pandemic's brutal economic consequences on the continent become increasingly clear. "The impact has been immense. These are countries with very limited social safety nets, already very high levels of debt and ... very little resources to respond to a crisis of this magnitude," said Murithi Murtiga, a Nairobi-based analyst with the International Crisis Group.

Studies have shown that millions of people in Africa will be pushed into poverty and many more forced to surrender hard-won gains in income and quality of life as the effects of the pandemic continue to surge across the continent. Although analysts predict a steady economic recovery on the continent during 2021, the outbreak has undone years of growth. The slow rollout of vaccines in Africa threatens to cause further misery, with new waves of infections likely to bring many more deaths and further economic damage.

The World Health Organization said last month [April 2021] that Africa had given fewer than 2% of vaccinations administered globally and was being left behind. The death toll on the continent is 120 000, though this is thought to be a significant underestimate.

In South Africa, one of the continent's biggest economies and the country worst hit by Covid, Zweli Mkhize, the health minister, warned last week of a 3rd wave of infections. Covid has killed 55 000 people in South Africa, according to official figures, with a more transmissible variant fueling infections in December [2020] and January [2021]. Excess mortality statistics suggest the actual toll may be 2 or even 3 times higher. So far only 300 000 health workers, out of a total of 1.25m, have been vaccinated in South Africa, though authorities have pledged to expand the programme in coming months. "What we would like is a situation where we vaccinate as many people as possible without really worrying about the next wave .... Everything about it remains uncertain .... when it is to arise, how bad it is," Mkhize told members of parliament.

The continent's vaccine rollout is hindered by the crisis in India, as the bulk of the vaccines supplied so far to Africa via the global vaccine-sharing facility Covax have been AstraZeneca shots manufactured there. India suspended its exports of the vaccine in March [2021] to cope with domestic demand. It remains unclear when exports will resume, Nkengasong said, warning the situation in India could affect Africa's vaccine rollout "for the weeks and perhaps months to come".

Analysis by the Pew Research Center found that the recession caused by Covid has pushed 131 million people into poverty across the world. Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia accounted for most of the increase, reversing years of progress. Some 494 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa, out of a total population of 1.14 billion, were expected to be living in poverty ahead of the pandemic in 2020. That total has risen by 40 million, the Pew analysis estimated.

Though economic growth was patchy and benefits distributed unequally, sub-Saharan Africa had not suffered a depression for 25 years until the pandemic. Murtiga described a "multilayered crisis", despite fairly resilient economies which rebound quickly. "Household budgets have collapsed, and during lockdowns there was limited support for those who lost livelihoods. At a macro level, there is very little fiscal space and this has left countries facing a tough task in terms of recovery," he said.

The slowdown has hit those earning a living from informal urban jobs hardest, especially women. In Kenya, one study published earlier this year [2021] found many young people had given up education as they sought to earn money. "Male youth are reporting being... [idle] in the homes because of the Covid-19 lockdowns, which means no work, yet the female youths are reporting additional workload at the household level," said study adviser Dr Grace Wamue-Ngare, an associate professor at Kenyatta University in Nairobi.

In South Africa, statistics released by the South African Human Rights Commission revealed more than half of the country's consumers who had borrowed money now have worrying levels of debt. The country's middle class was being wiped out, one newspaper said. Shopping malls across the country are full of shuttered businesses, with industry associations reporting thousands of restaurants shutting.

Before the pandemic, Africa had the 2nd-fasting growing tourism sector in the world, contributing 8.5% of the continent's GDP and employing 24 million people. Even the most optimistic forecasts suggest it will take 2 years at least for the visitors to return in similar numbers. Ntokozo Dube, a tourist guide in Soweto, the township south of Johannesburg, has been unemployed for more than a year. "We are just trying to survive the best we can. I've been knocking and knocking on doors to find some work but getting nowhere. It's very tough," Dube, 31, said. South Africa has introduced relief programmes, but delivery has been patchy. Dube has received nothing, blaming "corruption". "People who have debts are having them collected. Food is expensive," he said. "The people are suffering a lot."

Ontario reported 369 new cases of COVID-19 and 29 more deaths on [Sat 1 May 2021] as overall admissions to intensive care units climbed to 900 for the first time. Some 2152 people in the province remain in hospital because of the infectious disease, a figure that has consistently been trending upward since the start of the 3rd wave of the pandemic. Of the patients in ICUs, 637 require ventilators to breathe.

As hospitals continue to move critically ill patients around the province and bring in health care personnel from other provinces, the Ontario health ministry said on [Sat 1 May 2021] that it hasn't yet activated an ICU triage protocol. Activating a triage would mean the hardest decisions health care providers ever face will have to be made. These decisions include who gets potentially life-saving care and who doesn't.

In a statement, the ministry said the current stay-at-home order - combined with investments to increase hospital beds across the province - means this more drastic step has not yet been taken. "These efforts combined with the ramping down of elective surgeries and other non-emergent/urgent clinical activity will add an additional 700 - 1000 beds and ensure our health system has the tools and resources needed to provide world-class care to every Ontarian who requires hospitalization," the ministry said in the statement.

Last month [April 2021], however, a number of Ontario medical professionals said they feared they may be forced to start triaging ICU patients within weeks. According to the latest draft of Ontario's protocol, which is a work in progress, the lowest level of triage, Level 1, means anyone with short-term mortality risk greater than 80% is de-prioritized for an ICU bed.

Anthony Dale, president of the Ontario Hospital Association, said it would be considered a "failure" if hospitals had to enact a triage protocol given that efforts are being made across the province to provide every patient with the care they need. "We're working as hard as humanly possible ... to make sure that it never comes into effect," he said. "We are fighting everyday to prevent it from occurring." Dale said there is also a glimmer of hope based on the latest COVID-19 modelling projections released last week, which suggest the province's 3rd wave of the pandemic may have already reached its peak. Despite this hope, Dale said the situation in ICUs is far worse than he had feared. "Months ago, I never in my dreams would have thought that we could have reached this very high level of patients [in ICUs]," he told CBC News on [Sat 1 May 2021]. "I never thought we would see anything like this."

As of [Sat 1 May 2021], there are 1050 new cases in Toronto, 819 in Peel Region, 286 in York Region, 158 in Ottawa and 157 in Durham Region, according to health minister Christine Elliott.

Public health units collectively administered 107 770 doses of vaccines on [Fri 30 Apr 2021], according to Ontario's health ministry. As of [Fri 30 Apr 2021] night, 373 559 people in Ontario had gotten both shots. The province has used 5 247 684 doses of vaccines it has received to date. Ontario said it plans to expand eligibility for COVID-19 vaccines substantially in May [2021], with shipments to the province expected to ramp up in the coming weeks. With millions of doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines expected to begin arriving in Ontario, the province's vaccine task force says it can accelerate its timeline so that all Ontarians over the age of 18 can use its call centre and booking portal starting the week of [24 May 2021].

Health Canada said on [Fri 30 Apr 2021] that it's holding off on distributing the first shipment of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine after it became clear that the doses that arrived on [Wed 28 Apr 2021] were processed in the same US plant that has been mired in quality-control problems.

Both Ontario and Toronto have reported this week that 40% of its residents have been vaccinated to date. "While we take a minute to mark the 40% goal being met early, I want you to know that we won't rest until everyone has received their vaccination, the lockdown is lifted, and we truly put this pandemic behind us," Toronto mayor John Tory said in a statement on [Sat 1 May 2021].

Meanwhile, Ontario's network of labs completed 46 803 test samples since the last update and logged a test positivity rate of 7.3%. The new deaths reported [Sat 1 May 2021] bring the official death toll to 8079. The 7-day average currently sits at 3618, down from 3722 on [Fri 30 Apr 2021].

On [Fri 30 Apr 2021], the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) said in a statement that a registered nurse who worked in Peel Region, Lorraine Gouveia, has died after contracting COVID-19. "Lorraine has left us far too soon and we honour her commitment to her role as an RN and for her kind spirit," the statement reads. Gouveia was described by the Service Employees International Union as a "fierce activist, loving mother, admired friend and dedicated to making the lives of everyone she came in contact with better". In the wake of her death, the RNAO called on Ontario Premier Doug Ford's government to "immediately act on all the recommendations of the science table and the various long-term care reports".

While Ontario has adopted some recommendations made by Ontario's COVID-19 science advisory table, such as targeting neighbourhoods identified as COVID-19 hot spots, Ford's sick-leave announcement didn't include 10 days of paid sick days as recommended by the panel. Asked on [Fri 30 Apr 2021] about the number of sick days, Ford said he appreciated advice from the science table, but also takes guidance from hospital CEOs and Dr David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer of health.

[...]

The report follows a statement by Ford on Friday [30 Apr 2021] that quarantine measures need to be increased at Canada's land border with the US. "We can't take anything for granted right now, we need to be more vigilant than ever," Ford said. "Not enough is being done to keep these deadly variants out of Canada," he said. Ford noted people are flying to Buffalo, NY, and taking a taxi over the border to avoid quarantining.

CBC News reported on [Thu 29 Apr 2021] that Ford's government sent the federal government a letter asking for quarantine measures, such as mandatory hotel stays, to be implemented at the land border with the US.

[One possible explanation proposed for the rise in cases in Canada is the new variants. The variant (first detected in the UK), B1.1.7 - accounts for more than two-thirds of infections in Ontario. Canada also had a slow start to its vaccination rollout. The US has outpaced Canada in terms of delivering vaccines in both total amount of doses given and on a per capita basis. - Mod.UBA]

[3] CIDRAP: Mother-to-baby transmission

Infants born to women with COVID-19 have a low chance of contracting the disease from their mothers and having complications, according to a study published on Thu 29 Apr 2021 in JAMA. The study included 88 159 Swedish newborns, 92% of those born in the country from [11 Mar 2020], to [31 Jan 2021]. Of those, 2323 (1.6%) were delivered by mothers who tested positive for COVID-19, and only 21 infants in that group (0.9%) tested positive for COVID-19 themselves.

The mean gestational age among babies born to women with COVID was 39.2 weeks, compared with 39.6 weeks in the non-COVID group, and preterm birth rates were 8.8% versus 5.5%, respectively. Mortality was higher in infants who had mothers with COVID-19 (0.3% vs 0.12%), but the researchers say this difference is statistically insignificant, as is the length of hospital stay and breastfeeding rates.

In a matched cohort (infants from COVID-positive mothers with up to 4 infants from mothers without a positive COVID-19 diagnosis), infants in the maternal COVID-19 group were more likely to need neonatal care (11.7% vs 8.4%; odds ratio [OR] 1.47), or have respiratory distress syndrome (1.2% vs 0.5%; OR, 2.40), any neonatal respiratory disorder (2.8% vs 2%; OR 1.42), or hyperbilirubinemia, which leads to jaundice (3.6% vs 2.5%; OR 1.47).

"This study found support for preterm birth being an important mediator of the association between maternal SARS-CoV-2 and increased neonatal respiratory morbidity," write the researchers, "whereas no statistically significant direct, infectious association with maternal SARS-CoV-2 could be demonstrated."

Bias selection may have passed over women with asymptomatic COVID and homed in on women with more severe COVID-19 during testing decisions, note Dani Dumitriu and Cynthia Gyamfi-Bannerman in an editorial in the same journal. "Taken together with the lack of information on maternal illness severity and infection timing, the reported associations are likely to overestimate true neonatal morbidity," they write.

"Our study suggests that mother and baby can be cared for together and that nursing can be recommended without danger to the baby's health," concluded first study author Mikael Norman, in a Karolinska Institutet press release [https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-04/ki-lro042921.php].

Key Points
----------
Question. What are the outcomes in newborn infants of mothers testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy?

Findings. In this nationwide, prospective cohort study that included 88 159 infants from Sweden, SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy was significantly associated with higher risk of any neonatal respiratory disorder (2.8% vs 2.0%; odds ratio [OR] 1.42) and some other neonatal morbidities, but not neonatal mortality (0.30% vs 0.12%; OR 2.55).

Meaning. Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy was significantly associated with small increases in the absolute risk of respiratory disorders and some other neonatal morbidities.

Conclusions and relevance. In a nationwide cohort of infants in Sweden, maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy was significantly associated with small increases in some neonatal morbidities. Given the small numbers of events for many of the outcomes and the large number of statistical comparisons, the findings should be interpreted as exploratory.

Editorial. Dumitriu D, Gyamfi-Bannerman C. Understanding risk for newborns born to SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers. JAMA. Published online 29 Apr 2021. doi:10.1001/jama.2021.6210

"There were no differences in neonatal mortality, length of hospital stay, or breastfeeding rates.

...there was a higher rate of preterm delivery (gestational age under 37 weeks) among infected mothers: 8.8% in the SARS-CoV-2-positive group compared with 5.5% in the comparison group. Because preterm birth may be in the causal pathway, the authors performed mediation analyses and found that preterm delivery could explain an estimated 89.3% of the association between maternal SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and any neonatal respiratory disorder. Although the higher occurrence of neonatal morbidities initially seems concerning, when put in the context of a higher rate of preterm birth in the SARS-CoV-2-positive group, the findings appear expected.

Among infants born to SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers, Norman et al reported the incidence of positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results in infants to be low (0.9%), and none of the PCR-positive infants were reported to have congenital pneumonia.

In the US, approximately half of all women testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 on universal screening at admission to labor and delivery are asymptomatic [11,12] and the relative risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes increases with COVID-19 disease severity [4,12]. The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate reported by Norman et al was 2.6% among mothers who gave birth during a period when the reported overall positivity rate was 5.5% in the Swedish population, suggesting possible misclassification of untested women with asymptomatic COVID-19 as negative and possible biased selection of women with more severe COVID-19 into the positive group. Taken together with the lack of information on maternal illness severity and infection timing, the reported associations are likely to overestimate true neonatal morbidity." - Mod.LK]
