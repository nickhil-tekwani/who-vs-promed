The Southeastern USA appears to have its own version of the tick-borne
ailment Lyme disease, one that is not detectable by most standard tests,
according to Georgia researchers. Extensive laboratory testing of 23
adults with the characteristic bull's eye rash showed that 70% were not
infected with the spirochete known to cause Lyme disease, according to the
study published in the Nov.1999 issue of Archives of Dermatology.
Thirty percent of patients did test positive for the spirochete, but on
closer analysis, even in those patients, the spirochete, _Borrelia
burgdorferi_, had a different protein composition than that causing Lyme
disease in New England and the Midwest, said Dr. Michael Felz, family
medicine physician at the Medical College of Georgia and principal
investigator on the study.
"There is some kind of tick-transmitted illness here that acts like Lyme
disease but only fits the laboratory pattern 30% of the time, at least when
you apply a test that was designed for New England and the Midwest, where
Lyme disease is more common," Dr. Felz said. "In other words, we may need a
whole new testing system for this illness in the Southeast."
MCG collaborated with Georgia Southern University in Statesboro and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Fort Collins, Colo., on the
CDC-funded study.
The three-year study included Georgians and South Carolinians who lived
within 200 miles of Augusta and came to the MCG Family Practice Center to
see Dr. Felz after developing enlarging red rashes, 2 to 8 inches in
diameter. Approximately 90% were certain they had been bitten by a tick.
Before each patient began the standard therapy of a three-week oral regimen
of the antibiotic doxycycline hyclate, photographs, biopsies and blood
samples were taken for a complete series of tests. Tests included the
sophisticated polymerase chain reaction assay for spirochete DNA in biopsy
samples; the PCR was positive in five of 23 cases.
"These data [indicate] there is some Lyme disease here that meets the
criteria of current national lab testing standards. Yet the majority of
cases -- seven out of 10 -- are something different," Dr. Felz said. "The
tick
species transmitting this illness seems to be different and [that tick] may
be transmitting an organism that is very different [from _B. burgdorferi_].
"Lyme disease in the southeastern United States seems to be due to
genetically variant strains of the spirochete _Borrelia burgdorferi_," Dr.
Felz said. "These strains probably have a different DNA backbone and cause
different clinical symptoms and signs than is the case in other parts of
the country."
Dr. Felz, who has studied ticks and the diseases they carry for 9 years,
says this study is the "most scientifically rigorous analysis" of Lyme
disease ever in the southeastern United States.
Lyme disease typically begins with an enlarging, red circular rash and can
cause flulike symptoms of malaise, headache, fever and muscle soreness.
Left untreated, it also can lead to more serious secondary problems
including arthritis, nerve palsy, meningitis and heart arrhythmias.
Researchers found no evidence that the disease progressed to the second
stage in any of the study patients, leading them to believe that the Lyme
disease organism in the Southeast may be a less virulent strain and/or more
responsive to antibiotic therapy.

[This report has few details that would allow comment. If anyone with
details as to what the etiologic agent of these illnesses might be, whether
it is a different species of _Borrelia_ or a different strain of
_burgdorferi_, how specific and sensitive current diagnostic tets are, or
other information that might be useful, please let us know. - Mod.CHC]
