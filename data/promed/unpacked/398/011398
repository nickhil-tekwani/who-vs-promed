The United Nations (UN) said on Wednesday [29 May 2013] that 6 suspected cases of Ebola [virus disease] have been reported in the north eastern Democratic Republic of Congo [DRC], just 6 months after an outbreak of the deadly virus ended in the area.

Mr Sylvestre Ntumba, an official working for the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said the cases had been recorded between 1 May and 12 May [2013] in the Bas-Uele district, in the north eastern Orientale Province.

"Six suspected cases of Ebola [virus disease] have been reported," he told reporters at a press conference in Kinshasa. "With the support of the World Health Organization (WHO), a team from the provincial health division is on the ground to investigate and to take samples," he said, adding they are currently awaiting results.

The previous epidemic had its epicentre in Isiro, about 240 km [149 mi] from Mongo. Between May and November 2012, there were 62 cases with 34 deaths, according to the UN. For the 1st time, an infected woman had given birth to a premature baby alive -- but both finally died.

There is no treatment or vaccine against [ebolavirus]. It is transmitted by direct contact with blood, body fluids (sweat, urine, feces), through sexual [contact], and by mishandling of contaminated corpses. This disease is characterized by fever, vomiting, abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea, and bleeding gums.

During the last epidemic in the DRC, the fight has been hampered by traditions and customs encouraging proximity with the sick and the dead, and also the fear of people being placed in isolation, which might lead patients to flee into the bush.

[Orientale is one of the 10 provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Orientale Province lies in the north east of the country. It borders Equateur to the west, Kasai-Oriental province to the south west, Maniema to the south, and Nord-Kivu to the south east. The province is divided into the Bas-Uele, Haut-Uele, and Tshopo districts and the Ituri Interim Administration.

The precise location of this new outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Orientale Province is not stated in the brief report above, but it is implied that the new outbreak is not far from the previous outbreak.

We await further information about the location of this new outbreak and confirmation of the identity of the disease.
