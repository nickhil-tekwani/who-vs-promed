The sudden death of 50 to 100 juvenile flying foxes in Charters
Towers and Cairns in far north Queensland has raised concerns of an
exotic viral outbreak within the population.
The Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service has taken test samples from
the dead bats and says it would be irresponsible to try and predict
what caused the deaths at this early stage.
Dr Mark Read says Queensland Parks and Wildlife hopes to have results
by the end of the week. "Because we're at a very early stage of
trying to work out what's going on we're taking it seriously like we
would with any sort of mass death of animals in terms of trying to
work out what's going on," he said.
