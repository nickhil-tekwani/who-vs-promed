Apropos the recent interest in diseases of fruit bats, the following,
gleaned from "Old World Fruit Bats, An Action Plan for their Conservation
(IUCN/SSC Chiroptera Specialist Group)", may be of interest.
".....What little is known about disease in fruit bat populations is
summarized by Pierson and Rainey (1992). The first evidence of severe
epidemics decimating wild bat populations comes from the Whitney
Expeditions in the 1930s. In a 2-month survey of Kosrae in the Federated
States of Micronesia, researchers located only four bats (_Pteropus
mariannus ualanus_) and learned from the local residents that the other
animals had all died in a recent epidemic associated with an outbreak of
measles in the human population (Coultas,1931). Degener (1949) reports on a
similar epidemic depleting _P. tonganus_ populations near Savu Savu, Fiji,
sometime prior to 1949. More recently Flannery (1989) described epidemics
in two bat populations in Manus, the largest of the Admiralty Islands,
north of the New Guinean mainland, where local people reported that in 1985
many _P. neohibernicus_ were found dead and dying, presumably from disease,
under large and well-known bat roosts. Flannery (1989) reports on a similar
incident on the islands of Bougainville and Buka in the northern Solomons
in 1987. In this case, the dead bats were largely or entirely _P. rayneri
grandis_.
Flannery (1989) suggests that on Manus and Bougainville, the high fatality
rate and exceptional nature of the epidemics may indicate that the disease
organism responsible was not endemic, and indeed may have been introduced
into these populations by domestic animals......"
