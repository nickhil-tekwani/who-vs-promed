KEY UPDATES
Angola epidemiological update (as of 13 Oct 2016):
- The last confirmed case had symptom onset on 23 Jun [2016].
- 45 probable cases were reported in the last 4 weeks.
- Phase 2 of the vaccination campaign is ongoing, targeting more than 2 million people in 10 provinces.

Democratic Republic of the Congo epidemiological update (as of 19 Oct [2016])
- The last confirmed non-sylvatic case had symptom onset on 12 Jul [2016].
- 16 probable cases remain under investigation (4 in Kinshasa, 8 in Kwango, and one case each in Bas Uele, Kwilu, Lualaba and Sud Ubangi provinces).
- The reactive vaccination campaign in Feshi Health Zone in Kwango province concluded after 152 492 people were vaccinated. The reactive campaign in Mushenge Health Zone in Kasai province began on 20 Oct [2016].

ANALYSIS
- The continuing detection and investigation of probable cases (including the 45 probable cases in Angola) demonstrate that active surveillance is ongoing. Nevertheless, it is important to note persistent difficulties in surveillance and laboratory confirmation capacities, which may delay case detection. A strong and sustained surveillance effort remains crucial.
- The status of the probable cases in Angola will be reviewed by the Ministry of Health's Final Classification Committee once the investigations are completed on their exposure history and yellow fever vaccination status.

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SITUATION
Angola
- 45 probable cases were reported in the last 4 weeks (Fig. 1).
- From 5 Dec 2015 - 13 Oct 2016 (Table 1):
- 4306 suspected cases, with 376 deaths (case fatality rate, CFR: 8.8 percent);
- 884 cases have been laboratory confirmed, with 121 deaths (CFR: 13.7 percent).
- Since the start of the outbreak, suspected cases have been reported from all 18 provinces; confirmed cases have been reported from 80 districts in 16 provinces (Table 2). Autochthonous transmission has been reported from 45 districts in 12 provinces.

Democratic Republic of the Congo
- From 1 Jan - 19 Oct 2016 (Fig. 2, Table 1):
- 2970 notified cases reported from all 26 provinces;
- 77 confirmed cases have been identified from 2800 suspected cases that have been laboratory tested, with 16 deaths (CFR: 21 percent);
- Of the 77 confirmed cases, reported from 8 provinces (Fig. 4), 57 acquired infection in Angola, 13 are autochthonous, and 7 are cases of sylvatic transmission (not related to the outbreak).
- 16 probable cases remain under investigation, 4 in Kinshasa, 8 in Kwango and one case each in Bas Uele, Kwilu, Lualaba and Sud Ubangi provinces).

RESPONSE
- Information on the current outbreak continues to be updated on the WHO website
- In Angola, phase 2 of the vaccination campaign targeting more than 2 million people in 12 districts in 10 provinces is ongoing.
- In Democratic Republic of the Congo, the reactive vaccination campaign in Feshi Health Zone in Kwango province concluded after 152 492 people were vaccinated among a target of 146 449 (104.1 percent). The reactive campaign in Mushenge Health Zone in Kasai province began on 20 Oct [2016]. Monitoring continues in the 62 Health Zones where the pre-emptive vaccination campaigns were conducted in August 2016. WHO has sent more than 30 million vaccine doses to Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Uganda since the beginning of the outbreak through the International Coordinating Group (ICG) global stockpile, with additional vaccine doses from the manufacturer Bio-Manguinhos in Brazil.
- As of 20 Oct 2016, 20 million vaccine doses have been approved for Angola and 9.4 million doses for Democratic Republic of the Congo (Table 3).
- The number of vaccine doses currently available in the ICG global stockpile for emergency response is 6.4 million (Table 4). The number of doses already allocated to respond to the outbreak is not included in this number.

[It is important that the 45 probable cases in Angola and the 16 probable cases in the DR Congo be confirmed or discarded. If confirmed, vaccination in those areas is essential to keep transmission from spreading. Persistent difficulties in surveillance and laboratory confirmation capacities have been noted as an ongoing problem that requires a prompt solution so that detection and timely response can be initiated.
