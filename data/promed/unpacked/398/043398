Over the last month, the number of rabies foci within the Omsk region
has increased by more than 30 percent. According to the press-office
of the Territorial Management of the Federal Services for Consumer
Protection and Human Wellfare in the Omsk region [Rospotrebnadzor],
28 foci of rabies have been recorded during 2006 among wild animals,
livestock and pets in 13 districts of the region.
Rospotrebnadzor's management have published details on the actions
undertaken to control rabies in the region. People having contact
with infected animals have been vaccinated. Quarantine actions are
currently undertaken in 13 settlements.
This year, a large number of rabid animals have been detected in the
Kormilovskiy district. Inhabitants of many villages report the
detection of foxes roaming in the streets, farmsteads and in close
proximity to settlements. For example, in the village of Zotino, last
week 2 rabies foci were revealed nearly simultaneously. A dog in one
courtyard and a horse in another became victims of a rabid fox.
Experts from the Rospotrebnadzor management have referred to the
specific risk to children. In December 2006, pupils of the
Astrakhanovskaya elementary school in the Ljubinskiy district dug out
a dead fox covered with snow and played with it. These children are
now undergoing preventive vaccination.

During the first 20 days of December 2006, 5 new cases of rabies have
been reported in Udmurtiya, all of them in the Votkinskiy district.
This was revealed by the press-office of Rospotrebnadzor's management
in Udmurtiya. The area is considered to be the most severely
rabies-affected territory in the Republic; 15 percent of all rabies
cases among animals in the Udmurt Republic have been registered in this area.
The total number of rabies foci in the Republic, since the beginning
of 2006, is 94, of which 82 have been laboratory confirmed. Only 63
cases of rabies were detected in 2005. The situation remains adverse
also in the Malo-Purginskiy, Grakhovskiy, Zav'yalovskiy, &
Mozhginskiy districts and in the city of Izhevsk.

[Rabies incidence in animals continues to be high in Russia. The main
spreaders of infection are wild animals: foxes, raccoon dogs, wolves,
and badgers. In Udmurtiya alone, the number of rabies cases in
animals increased by 40 percent compared to 2005. The reason for this
increase is related to deficient control of vectors -- mainly foxes.
The Omsk area has always been known as a heavily infected area;
currently there are views ascribing the deterioration to the
migration of predators from Kazakhstan and to the significant
increase in the vector population.
Omsk is located in the southern part of the West-Siberian plain. In
the west and north it borders the Tumen region; in the east the Tomsk
and Novosibirsk regions; in the south and southwest the Republic of
Kazakhstan. A map is available at <http://www.univer.omsk.su/omsk/omskmap.html>
The Udmurt Republic (Udmurtiya) is located in the western part of the
Middle Urals, between the Kama and the Vyatka Rivers. The capital is
Izhevsk, situated on the Izh river; map available at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udmurtia>. - NP]
[Application of wildlife vaccination in such circumstances deserves
serious consideration. - Mod.AS]
