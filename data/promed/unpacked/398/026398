["Peste des petits ruminants (PPR), also known as sheep and goat plague, is a highly contagious animal disease affecting small ruminants. Once introduced, the virus can infect up to 90 per cent of an animal heard, and the disease kills anywhere from 30 to 70 per cent of infected animals. The PPR virus does not infect humans.

PPR was first described in 1942 in Cote d'Ivoire. Since then the disease has spread to large regions in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Today, a total of 76 countries in Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent have confirmed PPR within their borders, and many countries are at risk of the disease being introduced. These regions are home to approximately 1.7 billion heads -- roughly 80 per cent -- of the global population of sheep and goats." (See http://www.fao.org/ppr/en/)

According to the document issued by FAO and OIE in March 2015, entitled "Global strategy for the control and eradication of PPR", "PPR is currently present in some countries in the North Africa region, where the situation has evolved in recent years. The disease occurred for the 1st time in Morocco in 2008, with a virus belonging to lineage IV (a virus present notably in South Asia and the Middle East) and the same lineage IV is also present in Tunisia and Algeria and is widespread in Egypt. According to serological surveys it is suspected but not officially reported in Libya. In Mauritania, PPR is due to virus lineage II.

Morocco started implementing a mass vaccination campaign in 2008 and this continued in 2010-2011. The results demonstrated that PPR can be controlled through mass vaccination campaigns. Designing and implementing a regional PPR control strategy in North Africa is of crucial importance and regional policies and activities in the field of animal health are coordinated by the Mediterranean Animal Health Network (REMESA: Reseau Mediterraneen de Sante Animale) platform." See http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4460e.pdf.

Algeria is bordered to the north east by Tunisia, to the east by Libya, to the west by Morocco, to the south west by Western Sahara, Mauritania, and Mali, to the south east by Niger, and to the north by the Mediterranean Sea (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria). See map of Africa at http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/africa-political-map.htm. Maps of Algeria can be seen at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/africa/political-map-of-Algeria.gif and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=4024238,51855.

Information available from OIE's WAHID database http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist regarding countries which border Algeria, indicates PPR as "demonstrated clinical disease" in Morocco (January-June 2015), Libya (July-December 2012), and Mauritania (July-December 2014). Niger reports PPR as having disease restricted to certain zone(s)/region(s) (January-June 2015). Tunisia reports the disease as absent during the reporting period (January-June 2015). No information is available for Mali. (Note: The time period shown in parentheses refers to the last information reported by the OIE. - Mod.CRD]
