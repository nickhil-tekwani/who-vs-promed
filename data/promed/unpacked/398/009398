Pecan crop worse than feared
----------------------------
The quality and quantity of Georgia's 2013 pecan crop is in worse shape than originally feared. Pecan scab, a fungal disease, cuts the expected yields considerably.

Due in large part to pecan scab that thrives in wet conditions, the crop is expected to total between 50 and 60 million pounds, instead of the normal 90 million. The harvest fell short of even the most pessimistic predictions. University of Georgia's Lenny Wells said, "Most growers are getting about a third less than they thought."

In addition to producing fewer nuts, the crop is also much lighter. Wells reported that the lighter nuts are being blown out at cleaning plants [because] the weight of individual pecans is down. Wetter than usual weather this [2013] summer led to higher than normal incidence of the disease.

[Scab caused by the fungus _Cladosporium caryigenum_ is considered the most damaging disease of pecans. It became a problem in the early 1900s when farmers domesticated the crop in North America. Scab attacks the foliage, twigs, and developing fruit. Symptoms include lesions on leaves and immature fruit, and severe infection can lead to defoliation, fruit abortions, and poorly filled fruit. The pathogen is active throughout the growing season and can cause near total crop losses.

The fungus overwinters on leaf petioles and stems infected the previous season. Spores are produced in spring and spread locally by rain and dew, or by wind and infected plant material over longer distances. The disease is favoured by a moist climate but is not a problem in arid regions. Pecan varieties vary greatly in their susceptibility to scab. Most commercial varieties were at one time resistant, but resistance has broken down due to adaptation by the pathogen. The disease is managed by fungicide applications.
