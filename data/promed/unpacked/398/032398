Plans to eradicate tick disease in New Caledonian cattle
--------------------------------------------------------
The Australian and New Caledonian governments had agreed on measures
to eradicate the cattle tick disease introduced by a shipment of
Australian cattle.

Minister for Agriculture, Tony Burke, said he had spoken yesterday
[19 Mar 2008] to the President of the Government of New Caledonia,
Harold Martin, Member responsible for Agriculture, Eric Babin and
Member responsible for Budget and Finance, Pascal Vittori, and both
sides continued to work together cooperatively.

Australian Chief Veterinary Officer Dr. Andy Carroll has been in New
Caledonia this week to assist local authorities and help to determine
the best way forward.

"I can confirm the New Caledonian Government has agreed to a program
of cattle treatment with Imizol which I am advised should eradicate
the cattle tick disease," Mr. Burke said.

"The Australian Government will meet this cost and is urgently
sending supplies of the drug to New Caledonia. It is likely that
treatment could begin tomorrow afternoon.

"Cattle on 19 properties will be tested for babesiosis and then treated.

"Australian veterinary experts will remain in New Caledonia for the
testing and treatment of the cattle.

"Australia's Chief Veterinary Officer tells me he is confident that
if Australia and New Caledonia fully implement this program, we will
eradicate the babesiosis disease from New Caledonia."

A total of 7 cattle have died in New Caledonia from suspected babesiosis.
