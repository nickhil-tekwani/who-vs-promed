An Arizona woman who lived on the Navajo Nation died of hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome (HPS), which is caused by the hantavirus [_Sin Nombre
virus_], an Indian health Services (IHS) official said. The Native American
woman died in December 2005, but the cause of her death wasn't confirmed
until this month, said Jenny Notah, associate director for the office of
program planning and evaluation for the Navajo Area Indian Health Service.
"This (new case of HPS alerts the community that the potential for
hantavirus infection is still out there. Be careful and avoid [rodent]
droppings, because HPS can occur at any time of the year," Notah said.
"The only information is that the case did occur in northern Arizona and
she was a Native American female. We don't provide the name and location of
the victim," said Notah, citing Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPA) guidelines as reason not to release further
details. This was the first HPS-related death on the reservation since
April 2005, Notah said.

[Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a deadly disease transmitted by
infected rodents through urine, droppings, or saliva. Humans can contract
the disease when they breathe in aerosolized virus. HPS was first
recognized in 1993 and has since been identified throughout the United
States. Although rare, HPS is potentially deadly. Rodent control in and
around the home remains the primary strategy for preventing hantavirus
infection. A comprehensive account of hantaviruses and hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome in the Americas can be accessed at the website of the Special
Pathogens Branch of the Centers for Disease Prevention and control:
