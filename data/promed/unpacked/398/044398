A meningitis outbreak spread to 4 of the nearly 3000 people aboard the MSC Orchestra cruise [ship], which docked yesterday [7 Oct 2012] in an Italian port, said local authorities. According to the source, the 2800 passengers on the boat had to be treated [urgently] against disease, after 4 crew members were hospitalized in serious condition.

One of the patients, a 32 year old Indonesian citizen, was reported to be very seriously ill by the head of emergency medicine at the hospital in Livorno, Francesco Genovesi, where a 47 year old Italian who worked in the ship's galley was also transferred. The other 2 infected people, a Brazilian and a Filipino, were admitted to the infectious diseases section of the hospital.

In a statement issued on Monday [8 Oct 2012] by MSC Cruises reported that "as a precaution and according to maritime authorities, all passengers received antibiotic prophylaxis. No other member of the crew or passengers showed symptoms of meningitis." The alarm about the spread had been given on Sunday [7 Oct 2012], when the MSC Orchestra arrived in Livorno (west of Italy), and since continued its journey to the French town of Villefranche, where another tour will to begin. The shipping company said that health authorities provided maritime antibiotic prophylaxis "just a precaution" and that the ship sailed after receiving clearance from doctors.

According to several media outlets say, the incident is another blow to the cruise industry, after 32 people died last January during the sinking of the Costa Crociere along the Tuscan coast.

A newspaper in Italy [http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/cronaca/2012/10/07/Meningite-nave-quattro-casi-sospetti-_7592928.html] is reporting that 4 crew members of the cruise ship MSC Orchestra have contracted bacterial meningitis. 2 of the 4 crew members are considered to be in serious condition. They were all hospitalized once the cruise ship reached port yesterday [7 Oct 2012].

According to this newspaper, one crew member is a 32 year old Indonesian who is currently in septic shock in the intensive care unit of a hospital in Livorno, Italy. He apparently worked in the engine room. A 2nd crew member is a 47 year old Italian who works in the cruise ship's galley, who also is in the intensive care unit. 2 other crew members include a Brazilian and a Filipino, whose conditions are described as less serious. They are hospitalized in the hospital's infectious disease department.

Other newspapers [http://www.abc.es/20121008/local-comunidad-valenciana/abci-cuatro-miembros-tripulacion-crucero-201210081422.html] state that the serious cases involve an Indonesian, age 32, and a Filipino, age 30, both of whom worked in the engine room.

Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Bacterial meningitis is very serious and can be fatal. It is not common on cruise ships, although it has occurred on other cruise ships [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10670158] as this case illustrates.

All of the crew members were given prophylactic antibiotics, which were also offered to the passengers. The 2800 dosages were described as an "unprecedented quantity over a period of time so limited." The medicine consisted of an antibiotic tablet of 500 milligrams for adults and syrup for about 400 children who were on board. An epidemiological survey was also conducted among the crew members who in recent days have been most in contact with the hospitalized crew.

The Orchestra is continuing its cruise as planned and has meanwhile docked in France's Villafranche, with next stops including Valencia, Ibiza, Tunis, Catania and Naples.

The Italian Health Ministry reported on Monday [8 Oct 2012] that passengers on board an Italian cruise ship were given antibiotics after 4 of the ship's crew members were found to have bacterial meningitis. The ministry said that all 4 had been transported to hospitals in the port of Livorno. Doctors have distributed more than 2800 doses of rifampicin and ciprofloxacin to passengers of the MSC Orchestra. Those who had already disembarked over the past week are advised to take similar precautionary measures. The 2500 passenger cruise ship is now anchored in the port of Villefranche sur Mer in France.

Italian officials have already contacted their French counterparts. The cruise company stated that it was doing all that is necessary to ensure the health and well-being of its crew members and guests. The 4 crew members were found to have contracted meningococcal meningitis. The illness is transmitted through close contact with saliva or respiratory secretions. The Health Ministry also noted that the strain was detected in crew members working in the ship's kitchen; hence, it is not likely that they had close contact with guests. 2 out of the 4 cases were diagnosed as [meningitis due to _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup] C.

[In the United States and most industrialized countries, antibiotic chemoprophylaxis among close contacts of a patient with invasive meningococcal disease is recommended to prevent secondary cases.

The following is extracted from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Meningitis, bacterial, airplane exposure - USA (KS ex FL): alert 20070724.2378:

Meningococcal meningitis occurs sporadically or as epidemics. Certain types of close contact of a case of meningococcal meningitis place a person at increased risk of developing meningitis for which antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis is recommended. These contacts include household members, daycare center members, and anyone directly exposed to the patient's respiratory secretions (for example, by kissing, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, or intubation of the patient) [see:
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046263.htm].

Antibiotics recommended for chemoprophylaxis are rifampin (an oral dose administered twice daily for 2 days), ciprofloxacin (single oral dose), and ceftriaxone (a single intramuscular dose). Chemoprophylaxis is not recommended for school or work contacts not directly exposed to directly exposed to a patient's respiratory secretions (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5945a2.htm).

According to CDC, for management of passengers aboard an airplane exposed to meningococcal disease, household members traveling with the index patient as well as persons traveling with the index patient who have prolonged close contact (for example, roommates, members of the same sports team) should be identified and the need for antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis evaluated. Antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis should also be considered for airline passengers who have had direct contact with respiratory secretions from the index patient, and for passengers seated directly next to the index patient on prolonged flights (>8 hours)
(http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2012/chapter-6-conveyance-and-transportation-issues/air-travel.htm).

Because the risk for illness is highest during the first few days after infection, chemoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible (ideally within 24 hours) after contact with an index case-patient
(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5023a2.htm).

Chemoprophylaxis administered >14 days is probably of limited or no value. For both the meningococcal conjugate and the polysaccharide vaccines, at least 7-10 days are required following vaccination for development of immunity. Meningococcal vaccination, however, is used to control spread of meningitis in outbreak situations.
