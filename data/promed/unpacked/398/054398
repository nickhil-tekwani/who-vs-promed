Farmers are being encouraged to take precautions after an outbreak of
Q fever in the past 6 weeks. 5 people, including 3 from the New
England region, have been diagnosed in the Hunter New England area,
with all involved in calving activities.

Hunter New England Area Health public health physician Dr David
Durrheim said Q fever could manifest with influenza-like symptoms
that lasted for several weeks.

"Calving is a high-risk activity for becoming infected with Q fever,"
Dr Durrheim said. "Anyone involved in calving or lambing should be vaccinated.

"Ideally people should be vaccinated at least 3 weeks before they are
exposed to Q fever risks to allow time to test whether they are
already immune, and for the vaccine to take effect."

The disease is caused by bacteria commonly spread to humans from
infected cattle, sheep or goats. Although most patients will recover,
some may develop chronic disease, leading to complications like
infection of the heart valves and prolonged ill health. Humans
become infected mainly by inhaling droplets or dust containing these
organisms, or through drinking unpasteurized milk.

The bacteria associated with the disease can remain in the
environment for extended periods.

[New England is the inland region behind the New South Wales north
coast. This is traditionally farming country and is usually bypassed
by travellers making their way up the coast, although the more direct
route between Queensland and Melbourne or Sydney passes through this
area. Hunter Valley is the closest major wine-producing region to
Sydney and is located west of Newcastle.

The Q fever organism is an obligate intracellular pathogen and has
been traditionally placed in the family _Rickettsiaceae_; however,
recent phylogenetic studies have demonstrated that _Coxiella
burnetii_ is more closely related to Legionella, Francisella and
Rickettsiella in the gamma subdivision of Proteobacteria.

The organism and its transmission have been recently discussed in the
below posting regarding contaminated wool (20051025.3118). Although
not available in many parts of the world, a Q fever vaccine is often
used in high-risk populations such as livestock handlers, abattoir
workers, veterinarians and laboratory workers working with animals
infected with _C. burnetii_, particularly sheep. The vaccine (Q-Vax)
contains formalin-inactivated phase I organisms and has been shown to
be very effective in preventing Q fever in high-risk individuals (1,
2). _C. burnetii_ has 2 distinct antigenic phases. Phase I is
pathogenic and is found in infected animals or in nature; phase II is
less pathogenic and is recovered after bacteria are passaged
repeatedly in cell cultures or eggs.

[Australia has an approved vaccine for use in humans. As the
regulatory powers consider the producers and veterinarians at risk of
the disease, it seems logical that they have been offering
vaccination for these individuals. The challenge is getting the at
risk population to accept the vaccinations. - Mods.TG/MPP]
