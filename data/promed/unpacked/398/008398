Viet Nam confirms 3rd human case died of bird flu this year
-----------------------------------------------------------
The 3-year old Vietnamese boy from Southwestern province Dong Thap of
Viet Nam confirmed of being infected H5N1 virus died, a local doctor
from the Ho Chi Minh Hospital of Tropical Diseases told Xinhua
Thursday [19 Mar 2009]. The infected patient died this afternoon
because of severe breathing difficulty caused by H5N1 virus tested by
the hospital, said the doctor.

The boy had been taken to the Ho Chi Minh Hospital of Tropical
Diseases on Monday [16 Mar 2009] with symptoms similar to bird flu
patients. He contacted with ducks raised by nearby farms before
developing bird flu symptoms, said his family member.

He is the 4th bird flu patient and the 3rd fatal human case of the
virus in Viet Nam this year. In 2008, bird flu killed 5 people in Viet Nam.
