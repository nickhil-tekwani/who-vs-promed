ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE - USA (02): VANCOMYCIN, COMMENT

With regard to the 2.5 per cent vancomycin resistance among defaecating crows, when we analysed our global collection of over 1200 _Bacillus anthracis_ isolates, around 3 per cent were resistant to one phage or another; pick your antibiotic, and 3-6 per cent were resistant to it. So 3 per cent antibiotic resistance is normal in any large collection. It reflects normal genetic wobbling.

Way back in the 1960s and 1970s when I was studying salmonella outbreaks in the UK, the reference collection at PHLS Colindale that dated back to the 1930s displayed resistances to modern antibiotics which had not been discovered at the time the "resistant" salmonella isolates were archived.

What was found in these crows is normal and not a sign of some incipient disaster.

[The comment made by Dr Hugh-Jones challenges the conclusions posited in the scientific article: "American crows as carriers of vancomycin-resistant enterococci with vanA gene", and highlights the need to study in depth antibiotic resistance to dissect "genetic wobbling" from true evolution of antibiotic resistance due to selective pressure. - Mod.PMB]
