20 May 2013
Within the framework of its continuous monitoring and the epidemiological surveillance of Coronavirus, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced the demise of one patient, who has been previously announced to be infected with this virus in the Al-Ahsa region, as he was suffering from chronic heart diseases, diabetes and high blood pressure, in addition to kidney failure. Thus, the number of deaths due to this virus, up to the date of this statement, has reached 16.

MOH has further declared that one of the cases, who has been previously announced to be infected with this virus among the Health staff, has recovered and been released from the hospital. It is noteworthy that no new Coronavirus cases, up to the last announcement, have been recorded.

[As of 20 May 2013 there have been a total of 22 cases including 10 deaths associated with the outbreak of MERS-CoV in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. This raises the total number of laboratory confirmed cases reported by WHO to 41 including 21 deaths (case fatality rate of 51.2 percent). (See below for information on additional cases). - Mod.MPP]

Tunisian man dies of new coronavirus
------------------------------------
A man has died of the novel coronavirus (NCoV) [now referred to as MERS-CoV] in Tunisia, in what is believed to be the 1st such case in Africa.

Tunisia's health ministry said the 66-year-old had visited Saudi Arabia, which is badly affected by the virus [according to news reports in the earlier ProMED-mail post on these cases, there was a history of travel to both Saudi Arabia and Qatar prior to onset of symptoms -- see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (05): Tunisia ex Saudi Arabia/Qatar, fatal, RFI 20130520.1725864].

About 20 deaths and 41 cases have been reported worldwide since 2012, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says. [There are now 21 deaths reported, see above press release from the Saudi Arabian MOH - Mod.MPP]

NCoV [MERS-CoV] is from the same family of viruses as the one that caused the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, killing about 770 people.

However, NCoV [MERS-CoV] and SARS are distinct from each other, the WHO says.

It appears likely that the virus can be passed between people in close contact, it adds.

The Tunisian man, a diabetic, had been complaining of breathing problems since he returned from Saudi Arabia and he died in hospital in the coastal city of Monastir, AFP news agency reports. 2 of his children also contracted the virus, but had responded to treatment, the health ministry said, in a statement.

"These Tunisia cases haven't changed our risk assessment, but they do show the virus is still spreading," said WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl, AP news agency reports.

Cases have been detected in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Germany, the UK and France.

"All of the European cases have had a direct or indirect connection to the Middle East, including 2 cases with recent travel history from the UAE," the WHO Update says.

22 of the 41 cases reported worldwide are in Saudi Arabia, it adds.

Out of the 20 [now 21] deaths, 9 [now 10] of them have been in the kingdom, WHO says.

[The addition to these 3 cases (one fatal, 2 recovered), if confirmed by official statements (to date there have only been press reports on these cases without official statements on the Tunisian MOH website or through WHO) will bring the worldwide total of laboratory confirmed cases to 44 including 22 deaths. All cases to date can be linked to exposure in the Middle East. There has been documented limited person-to-person transmission in both the UK and France, where secondary cases occurred in individuals having close contact with cases related to exposure in the Middle East (1 secondary case in France, and 2 in the UK).

[3]Call for international meeting
Date: 21 May 2013
From: Daniel Lucey <DRL23@Georgetown.edu>


During the past 5 weeks I have been kindly welcomed by medical and public health colleagues while traveling in Jordan, Qatar, UAE, and Egypt to discuss the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) of 2012-2013, and lessons from the SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic of 2002-2003.

Based on these experiences, and those working as a physician during times when novel infectious diseases caused crises in hospitals e.g., AIDS in San Francisco in 1982, anthrax in Washington in 2001, and SARS in Toronto in 2003, I am writing to recommend 2 measures be coordinated by international public health and medical authorities to strengthen preparedness against MERS-CoV:

1- Convene in the Middle East an open "One Health" MERS-CoV conference within the next 3 weeks, to discuss all key issues necessary to prevent and control this novel coronavirus.
A. Such key issues would include e.g., clinical, epidemiologic, virologic, immunologic, risk communication, animal reservoir(s), global public health, animal model(s), antiviral treatment protocols, and additional international collaborative protocols (e.g., by the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC)).
B. The most recent information would be shared by the 8 (or more) nations linked to laboratory-confirmed infections: Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, UK, Germany, France, and Tunisia.
C. The conference should be held in the next 3 weeks due to the accelerating pace of the "emergence" of the virus, and also due to increased travel and other traditional activities prior to and during the month of Ramadan [9 Jul 2013-7 Aug 2013].

2 - Create a detailed medical and public health operational plan for both hospital and outpatient settings where patients are evaluated for MERS-CoV.
A. A major goal of this effort is to decrease the risk of health care facility-associated transmission of this virus, as has now been proven to occur in several countries.
B. Another major goal of this effort is to decrease virus transmission in the community partly by optimizing contact tracing via close collaboration between medical and public health professionals.
C. Such a detailed plan can be based on experiences with MERS-CoV in the Middle East, Europe, and North Africa, as well as the highly detailed plans developed in the midst of the SARS crises in parts of Asia and Canada in 2003. Such detail would be in addition to existing guidance on MERS-CoV.

In the spirit of person-to-person cooperation,

[ProMED-mail supports Dr. Lucey's call for an international meeting to address concerns re: the MERS-CoV. As a reminder, there was an international meeting to discuss the SARS outbreak held in Kuala Lumpur, approximately this time of year 10 years ago, at which time similar issues were discussed related to the SARS outbreak. - Mod.MPP
