In its edition of 22 Feb 2000 Le Monde corrects itself by stating that
there where only 23 cases of listeriosis with seven deaths and not 30 as
previously reported. According to authorities quoted by Le Monde the
outbreak started at the end of November, 1999 with no new cases until the
end of December, then a peak in mid January with the last case being
diagnosed on 6 Feb 2000.

Answering John Marr's question:
The newborns get infected because their mothers eat food contanining _L.
monocytogenes_ and the bacteria is able to cross the placenta barrier and
get to the
baby. Virulent strains of the microorganism are capable of multiplying in
macrophages, disrupting these cells and producing septecemia. In this
stage, the organism have access to other body areas, which may envolve the
central nervous system, the heart, or other locations and may invade the
fetus of pregnant women. The stage of pregnancy when invasion occurs
determines the outcome of the disease: abortion, stillbirth or neonatal
sepsis.

Don't worry, pork tongue is not (yet ?) part of french newborns diet, such
as red or white wine, goose fat liver, french bread better known as
"baguette" and so on.
Newborns acquire _Listeria_ infection from their mother, not from hands but
from their bloodstream. If you have some medical knowledge or some general
culture you probably remember that during his intrauterine life, a foetus
receive everything he needs from his mother's blood. Unfortunately, some
pathogens are able to cross the placenta and to infect the foetus,
resulting in abortion or delivery of a dead newborn or delivery of an
infected newborn. Don't worry, even French mothers
(and sometimes fathers) wash their hands. By the way, I am not sure that
posting mail offensive to a group of people or to a country is a good
practice.

[No offense intended. I let that question go through because I thought
that post partum infection via parental hands was a reasonable possibility,
in France or anywhere else. I do appreciate the clarification of dietary
habits. - Mod.ES

Neonatal listeriosis is acquired prenatally from maternal infection. So
newborns could easily have become infected by their mothers' ingestion of
the contaminated pork tongue in gelatin while still pregnant.
According to Chin's CONTROL OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES MANUAL [(c) APHA,
2000, "The normal host who acquires infection may exhibit only an acute,
mild, febrile illness, but in pregnant women infection can be transmitted
to the fetus. Infants may be stillborn, born with septicemia, or develop
meningitis in the neonatal period even though the mother may be
asymptomatic at delivery. The postpartum course of the mother is usually
uneventful, but the case-fatality rate is 30% in newborn infants and
approaches 50% when onset occurs in the first four days..."

On the subject of newborn infection and its relationship to food borne
Listeria:
Reference: The American Academy of Pediatric's 1997 Pediatric Redbook, p. 328.
"Asymptomatic fecal and vaginal carriage [of _Listeria monocytogenes_ in
pregnant women can result in sporadic neonatal disease from transplacental
or ascending routes of infection or from exposure during delivery. Maternal
infection has been associated with abortion, preterm delivery, and other
obstetric complications. Late-onset neonatal infection can result from
acquisition of the organism during passage through the birth canal or from
environmental sources and the hematogenous invasion of the organism from
intestine."
Most of the documented cases in Listeria outbreaks are the
immunocompromised and weaker individuals. In such a food borne outbreak,
the majority of cases will not be diagnosed. Infection in an otherwise
healthy pregnant woman will often go unrecognized unless and until the
unborn child suffers and microbiological studies are done after delivery.

[Three additional subscribers responded to John Marr's question with brief
references to perinatal transmission of _Listeria_ that have been covered
adequately in the items selected above. Thanks to all for reminding us
that infections first observed in newborns may have been acquired prior to
or during delivery. This thread is cut until substantive new information
concerning the outbreak is forthcoming. - Mod.ES
