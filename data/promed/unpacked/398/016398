On Friday, the Russian Health Minister announced that 3 people fell sick
with anthrax in Siberia after killing calves diagnosed with the potentially
deadly disease. These 3 persons took part in an enforced slaughter of
calves diagnosed as suffering from anthrax. This occurred in the
Krasnoozyorsk district of the Novosibirsk region. In all, there were 13
sick and dead calves. [The Novosibirsk region is in the southern portion of
Western Siberia, sharing a border with Kazahkstan. - MPP
The 3 were hospitalized in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, where health
officials identified a total of 59 people who had contact with the 13 sick
animals.
The rest of the people were under medical supervision and receiving
preventative drugs, the ministry said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
The bacteria that causes anthrax is common among domesticated livestock and
can be transferred to humans. Widely feared as an agent in biological
warfare, it can cause skin lesions, ulcers and respiratory difficulty,
among other symptoms. The fatality rate of anthrax [in humans varies
widely according to how the bacteria is transmitted.
Last month, at least 14 people were diagnosed with anthrax in the eastern
Russian region of Buryatia, and 1 man died of the disease. Some of those
who have contracted anthrax took part in the slaughter of sick cattle.

[Humans may develop localized cutaneous lesions (malignant carbuncle) from
contact of broken skin with infected blood or tissues, or acquire a highly
fatal hemorrhagic mediastinitis (woolsorters' disease) from spore
inhalation when handling contaminated wool or hair. Man may also acquire
intestinal anthrax from consumption of under cooked meat. - Mod.TG
