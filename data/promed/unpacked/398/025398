RINDERPEST OUTBREAK THREATENS LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE IN EAST AFRICA

ROME, 24 February --A rinderpest epidemic has spread dramatically in Kenya
and has crossed the border into Tanzania, the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) reported today. The outbreak, considered to be the
worst in the last 15 years, comes at a time when parts of eastern Africa
are suffering from serious drought and tightening food supplies.
Rinderpest, the cause of the worst cattle plagues, is a highly contagious
and lethal disease, also affecting wild animals such as buffaloes, eland and
giraffe.
What appeared to start as an isolated local incident in Kenya is now
developing into a major epidemic involving eastern and southern Kenya and
northern Tanzania, which had been free of rinderpest for 14 years.
The severe current drought affecting the region has aggravated the
situation. In times of drought, pastoralists move their animals out of the
traditional range in search of grazing and water. It is this increased
mobility that is bringing rinderpest into contact with completely
susceptible populations of wildlife and unvaccinated livestock and will,
unless checked, sweep through Tanzania and on into southern Africa, FAO's
expert Mark Rweyemamu said.
The extension of rinderpest into Tanzania is a matter of great
socio-economic and ecological concern, threatening the wildlife reserves of
Ngorongoro and Serengeti as well as the livestock in southern Tanzania and
beyond.
Kenyan and Tanzanian veterinary and wildlife specialists are currently
surveying the situation in collaboration with the FAO Emergency Prevention
System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases (EMPRES) and
the Organisation of African Unity's Inter-African Bureau of Animal
Resources. An FAO emergency assistance project for
Tanzania has already started.
According to FAO, local resources are not considered sufficient to meet the
urgent needs of rinderpest surveillance and control in both countries.
Substantial donor support is urgently needed for a transboundary regional
control programme to prevent a major livestock and wildlife catastrophe that
could have serious consequences for food security in eastern and southern
Africa.
The World Food Summit Plan of Action in November made a commitment for the
progressive control of transboundary animal and plant diseases.
