Health officials investigate illnesses at Quality Pork Processors in Austin
No evidence to suggest general public or food supply at risk
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) is investigating a cluster
of 11 cases of neurological illness in workers at Quality Pork
Processors, Inc. (QPP) in Austin, Minnesota.

QPP staff and physicians in the Austin and Rochester area recently
realized there had been a pattern of cases of neurological illnesses
and they seemed to have a workplace in common. The 1st cases
developed symptoms in December 2006 and the other cases developed
symptoms over the following several months, up to July 2007. MDH was
contacted about a month ago about this cluster of cases and
immediately began reviewing clinical findings, interviewing workers
for potential exposures, and inspecting the plant. MDH learned last
week of an additional affected person who was hospitalized.

QPP is cooperating fully with the investigation, which is still
underway. The investigation includes interviewing affected and
non-affected workers, reviewing clinical data, obtaining diagnostic
samples, and extensively reviewing potential exposures. To date, a
specific cause has not been identified. Health officials are in
Austin today [3 Dec 2007] to continue the investigation and brief
employees, together with QPP officials.

The symptoms of the illness are recognized over several weeks to
months and are characterized by muscle weakness and abnormal
sensation. In some cases the muscle weakness has been severe. A total
of 2 individuals were hospitalized; one had an extended stay,
including rehabilitation. The illnesses appear to be an inflammatory
neurological disease, and in 5 of the cases the diagnosis was
consistent with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.
All individuals have been released and are in various stages of
recovery or rehabilitation. There have been no fatalities.

"All of the information we have to date indicates that the general
public is not at increased risk for developing this type of illness,"
said Minnesota Commissioner of Health Dr Sanne Magnan. "Also, there
is no evidence that the food supply has been affected."

The 11 cases worked in an area where either swine heads or organs are
processed. Thus far in the investigation, none of the cases had
apparent associations outside of the workplace.

"This is a very unusual occurrence," said Dr Ruth Lynfield, state
epidemiologist for MDH. "We are working very hard together with QPP
and many partners in public health, environmental health, medicine,
veterinary medicine, agriculture, and the swine industry to determine
the cause."

QPP has implemented additional precautionary measures at the plant in
conjunction with advice from MDH. MDH investigators are working with
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and alerting
colleagues in the rest of the country to determine if cases are being
seen in workers in other pork processing plants around the United States.

MDH officials will provide updates as new information about these
illnesses becomes available.

Workers with the 1st cases developed symptoms last December [2006],
and additional cases were detected up to July [2007]. The 11 people
afflicted worked in an area where either swine heads or organs were
processed, the department said. It said no illnesses have been
associated with the side of the plant where meat is processed.

The department said that no specific cause has been identified so far
and that it is investigating many types of possible exposure,
including toxins, infections, tissues from pigs and others.

Quality Pork Processors has been cooperating fully with the
investigation, the Health Department said, and has instituted
additional precautionary measures for workers at the plant following
advice from the department. The plant workforce totals about 1100.

The Health Department said that it is working with the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and that
investigators are checking to see whether cases have been seen in
workers at other pork processing plants around the country.

State health officials are investigating what they describe as a
cluster of unusual neurological illnesses at a southern Minnesota
pork processing facility.

In the past year, 11 workers at Quality Pork Processors in Austin
have developed inflammatory diseases characterized by muscle weakness
and severe fatigue; 2 workers were hospitalized.

The 1st cases of illness at the Austin plant showed up in December
2006. Throughout the spring and early summer [March through July?
2007], more workers got sick and occupational health staff at the
plant began noticing similarities in their conditions.

After consulting with physicians at 2 nearby health clinics, company
staff notified the Minnesota Department of Health in October [2007]
that there might be a problem.

Department investigators have been poring over the cases since then.
So far they say they have determined that the workers experienced an
inflammatory response to some kind of trigger. But they haven't
identified the trigger yet. It could be an infectious agent within
the plant, or even a chemical exposure.

Officials say they do not know what is causing the illnesses. But
they say there is no evidence that the general public or the food
supply is at risk.

Investigators are still trying to interview some of the sick workers,
but they say at least 5 of the cases appear to be consistent with an
uncommon disease called chronic inflammatory demyelinating
polyneuropathy, or CIDP, an autoimmune disease, meaning that the
immune system mistakenly attacks peripheral nerves.

Commissioner Sanne Magnan says generally the workers' symptoms
include a feeling of numbness and heaviness in the lower extremities,
along with a strong sense of fatigue.

"People who develop these types of illnesses may first experience
some weakness, or decreased feeling or tingling in their arms or
legs. It can be a very insidious onset," said Magnan. "The disease is
treated with some success. And people affected, however, may have
some residual numbness or weakness."

Some of the workers have been able to work throughout their illness.
Others have been temporarily disabled and are undergoing rehabilitation.

All 11 employees worked in the same room at the plant. It's an area
where meat and other tissues are extracted from the heads of slaughtered hogs.

Minnesota Commissioner of Agriculture Gene Hugoson says investigators
believe the problem is confined to this particular area of the plant.

"Every indication is that anyone else in the plant outside of this
location is not affected," said Hugoson. "For that reason it's very
much felt that the commonality here, the common denominator, is
really something that's going on inside this particular room or in
this area, where this process is, in fact, occurring."

Kelly Wadding, president and CEO of Quality Pork Processors, says the
company has taken several precautions to make sure that other workers
are not exposed to whatever is causing the illnesses.

"We've already given some of our employees a face mask, and
discontinued some operations that could be potential. Again, we have
no idea of the cause," said Wadding. "But we do want to take every
precautionary step that the Department of Health recommends, and that
we see that could possibly contribute to this."

The company has also given workers protective arms sleeves and
provided them with showers after their shifts. Waddington adds the
plant has discontinued a procedure that involves using compressed air
to harvest brain tissue from hogs.

The Department of Agriculture says it will compare some of the
procedures at the Austin plant with procedures at other pork
processors to see if some changes need to be made. The department is
asking other pork processors to review their employee records for
signs of similar illnesses.

The Minnesota Department of Health is also sending out an alert to
health providers statewide, to ask them to be on the lookout for
unusual inflammatory illnesses.

Quality Pork Processors is Austin's 2nd-largest employer, behind
Hormel Foods, with some 1300 employees. It slaughters and processes
up to 16 000 hogs a day for Hormel and several other companies.

Officials say there is no evidence that those products are affected
in any way by the illnesses at the Austin plant.

State health officials are investigating neurological illnesses among
11 workers at Quality Pork Processing in Austin.

Health Commissioner Dr Sanne Magnan said on Monday [3 Dec 2007] there
is no evidence that the general public is at risk, or that the food
coming out of the plant has been contaminated.

The workers who became ill had symptoms such as numbness, and
tingling in their arms and legs. 2 were hospitalized but have been
released. Some of the workers recovered completely, while others are
still going through rehabilitation, she said. 5 of the workers had
symptoms consistent with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.

The patients included men and women from a range of ages and
ethnicities, said State Epidemiologist Ruth Lynfield. But they all
worked in the same part of the plant, removing hog brains with
compressed air. None of the plant's other 1300 workers reported
similar symptoms, and there have been no similar reports at
Minnesota's other large hog slaughterhouse in Worthington, officials said.

Quality Pork owner and CEO Kelly Wadding said workers who butcher the
hog heads have been given more protective clothing and no longer use
compressed air to remove brains. He said Quality Pork's production
levels have not been reduced because of the illnesses.

Hormel Foods Corp., which is based in Austin, is Quality Pork's main customer.

Staff nurses at Quality Pork noticed the 1st symptoms in December
2006, and a total of 10 cases had come in through July [2007], Magnan
said. Doctors in Austin and at Mayo Clinic in Rochester were all
involved in trying to figure out what was making the workers sick.
Mayo reported the matter to the state Health Department in late
October [2007], Lynfield said.

She said the symptoms are not consistent with a repetitive stress
injury or with the family of diseases that include mad cow disease or
scrapie in sheep, which are linked to proteins called prions. But
while those diseases cause irreversible brain deterioration, most of
the workers in Austin have recovered. "That's not something you
expect with a prion disease," she said.

Magnan said they shared details of the investigation even though they
don't understand what made the workers sick because they want to be
transparent.

[At present, the cluster of neurologic illnesses in pork processing
plant workers described above seems to have experts from a variety of
disciplines currently attempting to define the actual clinical
syndrome and etiology (that includes the moderator team of
ProMED-mail as seen below). The variety of sources of information
included in the posting above give a somewhat uniform picture of the
clinical presentation -- muscular weakness and sensory deficits, with
5 of the 11 cases meeting the criteria for a diagnosis of chronic
inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, also known as
polyradiculoneuropathy. It appears as though the only affected
workers are those working in areas with exposure to the porcine
brains using compressed air to remove the brains and other tissues,
possibly resulting in an aerosolization of materials into the
environment. While one of the newswires above mentions that at
present "there have been no similar reports at Minnesota's other
large hog slaughterhouse in Worthington" it remains to be seen if
there are other "sporadic" cases identified in other slaughterhouses
throughout the USA, or in other countries, or if this is an event
isolated to a single slaughterhouse with a single as yet undefined
exposure that is triggering this neurologic illness. Whenever a "new
syndrome" is identified, we often find confirmation of the adage
"seek and ye shall find."

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), is an
acquired demyelinating neuropathy of unknown etiology. It presents as
a chronic illness with duration of progression greater than 8 weeks
and is associated with a demyelination process and signs of
inflammation or autoimmune disorder. It can present as a continuously
progressive or as a recurrent disorder with flare up occurring
separated by months or years. The disease classically presents with a
symmetrical proximal and distal weakness, some sensory involvement,
and a loss of deep tendon reflexes. The presentation is very similar
to Guillian-Barre syndrome (GBS), with the exception that GBS tends
to be an acute presentation whereas CIDP is chronic in presentation.
Both disorders (GBS and CIDP) present with elevated cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) protein, symmetric proximal and distal weakness,
areflexia (loss of reflexes), demyelination (loss of myelin sheath),
and evidence of immunopathology. It is felt to be an autoimmune
disorder that is triggered by an infection or exposure to a toxin in
genetically susceptible individuals. It has been associated with
other immune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),
hepatitis B and C, HIV, and multiple sclerosis (MS). Other supporting
evidence that it is most likely an autoimmune mediated disorder is
its demonstrated responsiveness to immunosuppressive and
immunomodulatory treatments, and the pathologic findings on nerve
biopsy. It can be difficult to distinguish from other metabolic and
toxic neuropathies.

It occurs in all age groups, but more often occur in adults. The male
to female ratio is approximately 2:1. While the exact prevalence
worldwide is unknown, estimates are a range from 1.9 to 7.8 per 100
000 population. (Background on CIDP along with suggested bibliography
excerpted from Dalakas MC: Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating
Polyneuropathy (CIDP) Information Center, available at

ProMED-mail would very much appreciate more information on results of
the investigations to date from knowledgeable sources. Information on
similar clinical syndromes occurring in slaughterhouse workers
elsewhere would also be very much appreciated.

[One has to wonder whether the association with aerosolizing brain
tissue could be inducing autoimmunity in a predisposed population. In
animal models, antibodies to neural tissue can cause a similar disease.

"A new animal model of a relapsing, mainly inflammatory and
demyelinating polyradiculopathy in dark Agouti rats [14] may help to
reveal immune factors particularly responsible for the relapsing
course of the disease. After a single immunization with bovine
peripheral nerve myelin rats presented initially with a mild disease
followed by a relapse with more severe paraparesis."

Neurol. 2005 Jun; 18(3): 273-8. - Mod.LM]

[A number of entities are grouped under the heading of chronic
acquired demyelinating neuropathy (CADP) based on differing clinical
presentations, but which all progress or relapse over at least eight
weeks. Eight weeks divides the more acute inflammatory demyelinating
polyneuropathy (Guillain-Barre Syndrome) from CADP. CIDP is used to
refer to patients with demyelinating neuropathies and generalized
symmetric weakness. Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) and multifocal
acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (MADSAM) are
asymmetrical, multifocal forms of CADP. MMN and MADSAM are
distinguished from each other by the presence of sensory involvement.
MMN is usually resistant to corticosteroid therapy and intravenous
immunoglobulin (IVIg). MADSAM is usually responsive to prednisone or
IVIg, and has a profile more analogous to classic CIDP with regards
to its laboratory features and treatment response. Katz JS,
Saperstein DS. Asymmetric Acquired Demyelinating Polyneuropathies:
MMN and MADSAM. Curr Treat Options Neurol. 2001 Mar;3(2):119-125.

See Table 2 at for a
comparison of distinguishing features for each of the CADPs discussed
above. A listing of concurrent illnesses seen in individuals with
CADP can be found at as
well. - Mod.ML]

[A few points occur to me (Having worked for 2 years as a meat
inspector, admittedly back in the early '60s, I am not a stranger to
such establishments):

- The onsets were spread out so it was probably not a singular exposure event;

- Have the investigators checked the families of those affected and
of their unaffected unit mates? There is always the chance that a low
frequency event affecting a number of people is found when a subset
of them are noted and then investigations target in on that now
visible handful, ignorant of the greater but spatially diluted number
elsewhere;

- Slaughter houses are well known for attracting specific ethnic
groups -- Canada Packers, where I worked, had an extraordinary number
of Ukrainians on the floor while the poultry plant had Italian ladies
(they sang while working). This cluster may just reflect a
coincidental genetically high risk group.

- Noting when it started and the latitude, could it not be an odd
response to a normal seasonal problem, like, say 'flu?

- If it were specific to hog brains, we would expect to have seen
this before and more widely ... unless this method of extracting
brains is only a few years old.

- Some years ago there was an epidemic of severe neurological damage
in Morocco, southern Spain and in Zaire when a jet engine lubricant
(I think that's what it was) was sold in street markets as a cooking
oil. It left hundreds of severely afflicted folk in its wake. What
if a similar oil had been used unwisely in certain equipment in the
swine head processing unit of this factory thereby necessitating a
cumulative dose before triggering symptoms?
- Mod.MHJ]

[If it was infectious you might expect to see secondary cases in
people close to the factory workers, such as their family members. I
am not aware of any porcine infection which cross into humans without
closer contact, the oral route or vector mediated.

Could it be toxic? You probably all remember the outbreak of
neurological & respiratory illness in Madrid many years ago, which
turned out to be food oil contaminated by [aniline-denatured rapeseed
oil] Some kind of contaminated food stuff on the plant would explain
why the workers get ill and no one else outside the factory. - Mods.EP/LL/MPP]
