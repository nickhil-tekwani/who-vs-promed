Health officials are investigating a rise in hepatitis A cases in Natrona County, the Wyoming Health Department announced [Wed 20 Dec 2017]. Authorities have so far confirmed 5 cases among residents of the county, the health department said. Before that, the last hepatitis A infection in the area occurred in 2012, said Clay Van Houten, Infectious Disease Epidemiology Program manager with the health department. Typically, only 2 hepatitis A cases are reported annually in all of Wyoming, he said.

Kim Deti, spokeswoman for the health department, declined to say whether those who contracted the illness in Natrona County are homeless or transient people. But she said that's been the case in other outbreaks across the county. She said she similarly didn't want to speculate whether this outbreak was related to another in Salt Lake City.

Cases aren't always related to something like a restaurant, she said. They can be spread by something as simple as not washing your hands after using the restroom. "You'd be surprised at how much of a difference it can make," Deti said.

She added that receiving the vaccination is the best way to prevent contracting hepatitis A. "It is part of the routine vaccine that people receive," she said. "If some people have trouble affording that, it may be covered by some of the public vaccine programs."

Hepatitis A can cause liver infections and is typically spread when people eat or drink something contaminated with a tiny amount of infected feces, according to the health department. It can also be spread by being in contact with someone with the disease, users of injection and non-injection drugs, men having sex with men, and traveling to countries with high rates of hepatitis A, according to the department.

The increases in local cases come amid reports of several large outbreaks nationally, including an outbreak now occurring in Salt Lake City.

[The risk factors for this small outbreak are not stated. Classically, clusters of hepatitis A in the developed world tended to be linked to a specific contaminated food, but recently large outbreaks have been linked to the homeless population with inadequate sanitary practices and to the MSM population where sexual practices increase the risk of transmission.

Childhood immunization for hepatitis A has been part of standard practice for the past 2 decades in the USA but most adults are susceptible. Genetic analysis of the isolates can assess the relationship to the larger outbreaks in southern California, Utah and eastern Michigan.
