[This is the 1st time that HPAI H5N6 has been reported in Europe. This subtype now joins H5N8 and H5N5 which have been causing significant production losses in this region. More information on the H5N6 subtype would be useful, particularly whether it is the same strain that has been spreading in Asia (China, South Korea, Japan, Myanmar, Laos and Viet Nam), or if it is a reassorted strain from H5N8 as was reported for H5N5 in Europe, (see posting 20161216.4701594).

On Mon 13 Feb 2017 Bosnia & Herzegovina reported an event of HPAI H5N8 in poultry, see event summary and map at
