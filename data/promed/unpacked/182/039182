Egypt: avian influenza situation - WHO update 7
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health and Population of Egypt has announced a new human
case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection. The case is an 8 year old
boy from Etsa District, Fayum Governorate. He was admitted to hospital with
symptoms on 3 Mar 2008. He is receiving treatment and is in a stable condition.

Investigations into the source of his infection indicate a history of
contact with sick and dead poultry. Only one of the 20 fatalities has been
an adult male.

Of the 47 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 20 have been fatal.

[This is the official WHO confirmation of the 47th human case of H5N1 avian
influenza reported earlier on 8 Mar 2008 in ProMED-mail post: Avian
influenza, human (35) Egypt 20080308.0955.

This is the 6th case of avian H5N1 influenza reported in Egypt since the
begining of 2008. Of these 6 cases, 4 were are adult women or young girls
while the other 2 were young males. This situation corresponds to the
general pattern observed since the begining of the outbreak in Egypt in
2006. Few of the cases have been adult males and only one of the 20
fatalities was an adult male. This pattern perhaps reflects the division of
labour in rural communities in Egypt where women and children are more
likely to be involved in the rearing of poultry, and for the preparation of
poultry for food.
