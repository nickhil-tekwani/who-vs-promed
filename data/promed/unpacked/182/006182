Gongzhuling, literally Princess Ridge, is a county-level city
situated between Siping and Changchun in Jilin province, along the
main railway line in the northeast of the People's Republic of China.
Major employers in the city include Jilin Academy of Agricultural
Sciences, located on the north side of the railway, and several
factories which manufacture auto parts. There is a major military
presence in this small town, including a PLA base and a military
airport.
