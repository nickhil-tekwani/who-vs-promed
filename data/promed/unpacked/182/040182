Another death of a child was confirmed in Muzaffarpur [Bihar] due to acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Shrikrishna Medical College & Hospital (SKMCH) Superintendent Dr Sunil Kumar said that this is the 4th death due to AES in Bihar this year [2020].

Informing about the latest development, SKMCH Superintendent Dr Sunil Kumar said, as quoted by news agency ANI [Asian News International], "A child died due to acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) at Shrikrishna Medical College & Hospital (SKMCH), Muzaffarpur in Bihar today [9 May 2020]. A total of 21 children, suffering from AES, have been admitted to the hospital this year [2020] out of which 4 died."

Earlier in April [2020], out of the 6 children admitted in the SKMCH, 3 were still under treatment, 2 have been discharged while one child had died. Bihar was the hotspot for the spread of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in 2019. At this time, the outbreak of AES occurred in as many as 222 blocks of Muzaffarpur and the adjoining districts in Bihar.

In June last year [2019], an outbreak of AES occurred in Muzaffarpur and the adjoining districts of the state resulting in deaths of more than 150 children. The deaths were mainly due to hypoglycemia. In subsequent months more cases and deaths were reported. The cause of outbreak was however, unclear. The 1st case of AES in Muzaffarpur district was recorded in 1995. There were 143 deaths in 2013, 355 in 2014, 11 in 2015, 4 in 2016, 11 in 2017, and 7 in 2018.

[The new cases admitted to the SKMCG indicate that the AES and Japanese encephalitis season is beginning in Bihar state as it has done annually for many years. The case count in the SKMCH is now increased from 14 on 28 Apr 2020 to 21 cases today. There is no indication of whether any of the 21 cases mentioned above were tested for Japanese encephalitis virus infection. AES is a common ailment in children in northeastern India, especially in Bihar state.

As mentioned in previous ProMED-mail posts, the issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. AES has continued to be attributed to various etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible Japanese encephalitis, enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, intoxication from lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 commonest agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.

The report above does not indicate whether any of the above etiologies have been ruled out or confirmed. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. The season in which AES cases occur is just beginning, and additional cases can be expected over the coming 6-7 months. - Mod.TY
