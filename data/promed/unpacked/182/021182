Russian scientists writing yesterday [7 Jan 2015] in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases describe a cluster of nosocomial Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in 8 HCWs [health care workers], 2 of whom had no contact with the patient's bodily fluids and may have been infected via airborne transmission.

A 23-year-old woman who was 22 weeks pregnant was admitted to a hospital in the Rostov region of southwestern Russia, an area with endemic CCHF, in May 2011. CCHF was lab-confirmed on her 5th day of hospitalization. She was intubated and placed on a ventilator the next day after her condition deteriorated, and she died the day after.

The 8 HCWs -- 3 physicians, 4 nurses, and 1 attendant -- developed CCHF 1 to 4 days after her death, and all cases were lab-confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and serology tests; 3 of the HCWs performed aerosol-generating procedures. Also, a nurse and an anesthesiologist who did not perform aerosol-generating procedures had no direct or indirect contact with the patient's bodily fluids.

All the HCWs worked in the patient's room during the potential exposure period without goggles and respirators, wearing only gloves, disposable surgical masks and gowns, which do not protect skin, conjunctiva, and the upper respiratory tract against aerosols, the authors reported. The patient was in an isolation room without negative pressure.

The authors cite 3 other published accounts of possible airborne CCHF transmission, including one published in Emerging Infectious Diseases last March [2014] on a cluster in Turkey. CCHF is caused by a bunyavirus [infection].

[Although contact with blood and secretions of CCHF virus infected patients represents the main cause of nosocomial infections, these cases provide evidence implicating that aerosol transmission of CCHF virus can occur under usual hospital conditions. This indicates that, ideally, rooms housing CCHF patents would best be under negative pressure and HCWs should take precautions such as respirators and goggles to avoid infection.

The Rostov region is endemic for CCHF virus. There were 39 cases in the region in the 1st 6 months of 2014. Although the circumstances under which the above index case acquired her CCHF virus infections is not reported, she may have become infected via a tick bite or exposure to the blood of an infected animal. The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. As the above cluster of cases illustrates, exposure in health care facilities also occurs when protection and control measures are inadequate. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.
