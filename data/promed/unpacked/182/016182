The 15-year-old was a herder from a small mountain village of Ichke-Zhergez in Japanese Kyrgyzstan, near the border with Kazakhstan and the Issyk-Kul lake. He died on Thu 9 Sep 2015, in the Karakol regional hospital, the ministry stated in a press release.

"He was diagnosed with bubonic plague," according to a statement. His body was cremated and the remains have been buried with particular precautions.

"We suspect that the affected person was infected with the plague by means of the bite of a flea," Tolo Isakov, a ministry official who heads the sanitation division, stated at a briefing in Bishkek Mon, 13 Sep 2015. He added that the last recorded case of bubonic plague in
Kyrgyzstan occurred 30 years ago.

Health Minister Dinara Saginbayeva aimed to dispel fears of an epidemic. "There won't be a bubonic plague epidemic," she stated. "The type of the illness which infected the teenager is just not conducive to a plague epidemic. So there are not any grounds for closing the borders."

Officers have hospitalized and quarantined 105 individuals who had contact with the deceased, together with doctors and medical employees who treated the boy, the minister stated. Doctors have been additionally administered antimicrobials, she stated.

[Although the posting reports that the last case of plague in Kyrgyzstan was 30 years ago, ProMED posted (Plague - Kyrgyzstan: (YK) fatal 20130829.1909839) 1 case in a 15-year-old boy (is this the same case?) and also several other presumptive cases.

As outlined by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and quoted in ProMED-mail post 20120601.1153277: "Death from bubonic plague occurs after the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ escapes from the infected bubo into the bloodstream (septicemic plague) causing the manifestations of the sepsis syndrome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with subsequent cutaneous hemorrhage may well have been what was called the 'Black Death' in the Middle Ages. The bacterium can spread to the lungs, causing a secondary plague pneumonia (secondary to the bacteremia), or to the meninges, causing a plague meningitis. Both of these events have a high case fatality rate and the secondary plague pneumonia is the way the infection spreads (by aerosol) from person to person.

"The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being infected.

"When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death." - Mod.LL
