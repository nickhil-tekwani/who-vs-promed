Cuba: Province of Santiago de Cuba Hit by Unidentified Virus
---------------------------------------------------
Special rooms have been set up in the Ambrosio Grillo y Clinico Quirurgico
hospitals to handle patients suffering from an outbreak of vomiting and
[bloody] diarrhea that has been affecting the province of Santiago de Cuba
for the past 2 weeks. [The symptoms are similar to those of amebiasis.]
The outbreak started during the recent carnival celebrations in Cuba and
was initially attributed to indigestion caused by rotten pizzas and
spaghetti sold in the Reparto Sueno area. Long lines of ailing
carnival-goers immediately appeared at the Saturnino Lora provincial hospital.
As the vomiting and diarrhea affected non-carnival-goers, residents started
to attribute the ailment to contaminated drinking water [authorities say
there is a shortage of chlorine].
Doctors have blamed a virus similar to that which causes dengue fever.

[Insertions between square brackets above are additional information from
the original Spanish version. Vomiting and diarrhea are not common symptoms
of dengue fever, nor of any related flavivirus such as West Nile or St
Louis encephalitis viruses. Perhaps our Cuban colleagues can provide
further details. - Mod.JW
The circumstances of the outbreak and the description of the illness do not
clearly favor a viral over a non-viral etiology. Further information is
requested. - Mod.CP]
