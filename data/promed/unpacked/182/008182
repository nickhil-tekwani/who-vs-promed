Last week [11-17 Feb 2008] there was a further rise in the number of
clinically suspected [dengue] cases (estimated at 29) and biologically
[laboratory] confirmed cases (9).

Since the beginning of the pre-alert, it is estimated that about 340 people
consulted a GP (general practitioner) for a clinical syndrome suggestive of
dengue fever, and 4 adults who presented a serious form [of the disease]
were treated in hospital. Since mid-December [2007] no hospitalizations
have been recorded.

Since December [2007], the [dengue virus] serotype most often identified
has been DEN-1, but serotype DEN-2 also circulates.

The decrease in the number of clinically suspected [dengue] cases continued
over the past 3 consecutive weeks. The development of biologically
confirmed [laboratory] cases follows the same dynamic, but the 2 indicators
are still above the epidemic threshold.

Since the beginning of the epidemic (2nd week of November [2007]), an
estimated 1550 total of clinically suspected cases of dengue have been
reported. Over the same period, there have been 17 hospitalizations for
biologically [laboratory] confirmed cases, including 12 adults (9 with
serious disease) and 5 children (with only the classical form of the disease).

The predominant dengue virus serotype is DEN-1, but dengue viruses 2 and 4
are also circulating.

The rain that fell on Rio this 2nd Thursday [18 Feb 2008] will aggravate
the dengue situation in the city. This disease, caused by [dengue virus
transmitted by] the bite of _Aedes aegypti_ is progressing rapidly. From
Thursday [14 Feb 2008] to Friday [15 Feb 2008] of last week 1110 new cases
were reported, a number higher than that registered in the whole month of
January 2007.

So far, more than 5000 people had dengue in 2008, according to the
Municipal Health Secretariat. This gives an average of one case every 15
minutes. The Secretariat also confirmed 3 deaths from dengue since January
[2008], and is investigating 12 other deaths.

The numbers of cases of dengue in the Capital [of Rondonia state] have
multiplied every day. Just in the health centers, about 70 per cent of
patients exhibit symptoms of the disease. However, this percentage does not
reflect reality, in that many patients do not seek medical care and so are
not recorded.

In the capital, as is common at this time of year due to the winter rainy
season in the Amazon, the number of cases increases. The municipal councils
do not take precautions to prevent an outbreak and only last year [2007],
Porto Velho reported more than 1400 [dengue] cases. Estimates of [dengue
cases] last year [2007] show that in many districts there was a real epidemic.

The Ministry of Health communicated on Friday afternoon [22 Feb 2008] a 40
per cent decline in the number of dengue cases in the country recorded
during the 1st 5 weeks of 2008, in comparison with the same period last
year [2007]. There were 32 122 recorded cases of the disease this year
[2008], compared with 53 224 in the 1st 5 weeks of 2007.

Although the national average has a decline [in dengue cases], in some
states cases increased. The state of Rio [de Janeiro] had 117 per cent more
recorded cases of dengue than in last year [2007], as well as in comparison
with the 1st 5 weeks of this year [2008]. So far, 10 people have died of
DHF [dengue hemorrhagic fever] in Rio, of a total of 14 [DHF deaths] across
the country as registered by the ministry.

In the analysis by region, the only increase [in the number of cases]
occurred in the north: 54 per cent. The biggest drop was in the central
west of the country, with 81 per cent, followed by decreases of 27 per cent
in the north east, 26 per cent in the south, and 5 per cent in the south
east. In the State of Sao Paulo, there was a 95 per cent drop in dengue
cases in this same period, according to the totals. In Santa Catarina, no
local cases were registered, only [cases of] people who [were infected
elsewhere and] reached the state already infected with the disease [virus].
Without the increase in Rio, the fall of the national average would be 55
per cent, the ministry reported.

The governor of Rio, Sergio Cabral, said that the major [dengue infection]
indexes are concentrated in the city of Rio. He announced a series of
measures to try to lower the number of cases. Legislation was sent to the
Legislative Assembly of the State of Rio de Janeiro, [authorizing the
intervention of] public health officials in private and public buildings in
order to investigate possible outbreaks of dengue in the homes in the
state. According to the Ministry of Health, about 80 per cent of outbreaks
of the disease occur in household [residential? - Mod.SH] areas.

The Bureau of Public Health has alerted the public that the number of
confirmed cases of dengue fever continues to increase. The bureau began
testing and confirming presented cases in May 2007. Except for July and
December 2007, the number of cases has been in the double-digit category
with February 2008 showing an exceptional increase -- 16 new cases in the
1st couple of weeks.

It is important for residents to clean and maintain their yards to
eliminate all actual and potential mosquito-breeding sites. This will
prevent the spreading of this disease in Palau. The public is also urged to
use insect repellant to prevent mosquito bites, including using long
sleeves, pants, socks, and shoes when cleaning around the house.

From: Thomas Coombs <tigertom101@hotmail.com>


The wet season in Timor L'este [East Timor] has produced the predicable
wave of dengue fever in Dili. Our organization, providing health care to
Australian 'expat' workers, has had 20 confirmed dengue cases since the
start of 2008.

Of these, 13 cases were serotyped, demonstrating 12 cases [of dengue virus]
serotype 4 and one [dengue virus] serotype 1 by PCR [polymerase chain
reaction].

These cases are the tip of the iceberg in Dili but serve to demonstrate the
continued circulation of multiple dengue virus serotypes.

From 10-16 Feb [2008], 2 more deaths as a result of dengue were recorded
bringing the number of fatalities to 3 so far this year. The 1st fatality
happened in week 3 of January [2008]. The Health Ministry's diseases
control division director Datuk Dr Hasan Abdul Rahman said at total of 888
cases of dengue were reported nationwide between 10-16 Feb [2008], an
increase of 141 cases from the previous week.

"Almost all states recorded an increase in the number of cases during the
period (10-16 Feb [2008]) except for Perlis, Kedah, Johor, and Putrajaya,"
he said here on Wednesday [20 Feb 2008]. During the same period the owners
of 56 premises, mostly shops and houses, were fined a total of MYR 12 000
[USD 3733] after it was found the premises were breeding grounds for the
_Aedes_ mosquito, which is responsible for spreading the disease, he added.

[It would be interesting to know how effective fines are in getting
community compliance with elimination of dengue virus vector mosquito
breeding sites. One supposes that a vigorous public education campaign
would be necessary before imposing fines.

Over 170 people have been infected with the dengue virus in [Zamboanga
City] since early this year [2008], according to Mayor Celso Lobregat.
"There is an outbreak of dengue, according to the City Health Office, and
we are appealing to everybody to help us fight dengue by cleaning our
houses, backyards, and surroundings and to get rid of breeding places of
mosquitoes, such as stagnant water, canals, flower pots, and discarded
tires," he said in a television broadcast. He also appealed to village
officials to continue their cleanup drive to curtail the rise in dengue cases.

Lobregat said the dengue outbreak affected many villages. He said most of
the victims were children. The number of dengue cases from January to
February [2008] is 5 times more than the same period last year [2007],
according to Lobregat.

Last year [2007], the Department of Health (DoH) said more than 300 people
had died due to dengue, while 30 000 more were infected with the disease.

According to the DoH, the most effective way to fight dengue is to search
and destroy the breeding sites of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, such as
coconut husks and empty bottles and tin cans.
