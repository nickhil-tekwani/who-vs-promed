New Brunswick: 7 Potential Neurosurgery-related Creutzfeldt-Jakob Cases
--------------------------------------------------
New Brunswick health officials have warned 7 former hospital patients
they may have contracted Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) during
neurosurgery in Moncton, New Brunswick, following the death of a
woman during summer 2003 from this rare but fatal brain-wasting
illness. The woman died on 31 Jul 2003, about 6 weeks after
undergoing neurosurgery at Moncton Hospital, where doctors noticed
she was showing symptoms of the disease. On Monday, autopsy results
of her brain tissue confirmed she died of classical CJD
Only about 30 Canadians are diagnosed each year with classical CJD,
which is a related but separate illness from the human form of mad
cow disease, called variant-CJD [abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or
vCJD in ProMED-mail]. However, officials cannot rule out the
possibility that she died of iatrogenic CJD. This is contracted when
the disease is mistakenly passed from one person to another, through
shared surgical instruments or through brain tissue transplants. The
woman may have been infected during a brain tissue transplant on her
spinal cord in 1992, when doctors implanted a tissue graft taken from
the brains of human cadavers. The type of implant used in 1992, known
as Tutoplast dura mater, was banned by Health Canada in 2002 because
of concerns that it could transmit CJD.
The woman returned to hospital for a 2nd operation in June 2003 and
died shortly afterwards. The instruments used in her operation have
since been incinerated, but of the 7 patients warned in the wake of
the woman's death, 2 may have been exposed to those instruments
before the instruments were destroyed. 5 others received similar
brain tissue transplants in the early 1990s.

[Scientists at the UK Health Protection Agency Laboratories at Porton
Down are reported to have developed a new way to reduce the risk of
contracting CJD from surgical instruments (see: BBC News online, Tue
16 Sep 2003 <http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3112604.stm>). The
prion proteins that cause CJD can stick to instruments and be passed
on to others who subsequently undergo surgery. Cleansing chemicals
and heat treatment have proved to be either ineffective in destroying
the agents or harmful to the equipment and the environment. Currently
surgical instruments used on patients who are known to have CJD are
quarantined after use and then destroyed. The new method is an
enzyme-based treatment that safely digests the rogue proteins. When
prions are exposed to the solution at a temperature of 60 degrees
Celsius, their infectivity is reduced almost a million-fold. The
active component [an enzyme] has been obtained from bacteria found in
volcanic pools. The risk of contracting CJD from surgery is very low,
but the greatest risk is posed by neurosurgery. However, it is
thought that some other organs, such as the tonsils and the appendix,
may also harbor prions and contaminate surgical instruments. If the
new decontamination technique is applicable generally, it should
eliminate this hazard. - Mod.CP]
