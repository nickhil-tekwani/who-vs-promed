[The need for complementary data on recently reported bluetongue-affected
Bulgaria and Portugal has been raised in ProMED-mail postings 20061106.3191
and 20061111.3238, respectively. Some hitherto unpublished information from
both countries has become available from their presentations during the
last meeting of EU's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health
(SCFCAH), held in Brussels on 8 Nov 2006. The above, as well as
presentations from other 5 member countries, are available under the title
"Bluetongue outbreaks in the northern part of the EU" at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/bluetongue_outbreaks_en.htm>.
The following transcribed data have been derived from the presentations of
Bulgaria and Portugal. Readers are encouraged to see the other

Control Measures For Bluetongue - Portugal 2006
-----------------------------------------------
30 Sep 2006: Detection of 7 PCR-positives (pooled sampling) in a bovine
sentinel holding at Vila Franca de Xira, within the Council of Azambuja (in
the free zone, contiguous with the restricted area). [For location, see
maps in slides 21, 22, 23].
12 Oct 2006: All 20 animals in the above holding individually tested with
negative PCR results. [The contradiction between the PCR results in both
testings deserves explanation].
Following the detection of the seropositive cattle in Vila Franca de Xira,
the following measures have been taken:
1. Testing of all animals for individual Elisa and RT-PCR.
2. Movement restrictions within a 20-km radius.
3. Surveillance activities (clinical, serological, entomological) within
the said 20-km radius.
Results of the serological surveillance in the 20-km radius:
- Holdings: From 837 bovine holdings, 107 were tested, of which 64 were
ELISA positive (59.81 percent), and 4 were PCR positive (6.25 percent).
- Animals: from 24 782 bovine animals, 677 were tested, of which 226 were
ELISA positive (33.38 percent), and 24 were PCR positive (3.55 percent).
- New PCR positive results detected in Vila Franca de Xira.
Consequent steps:
- Enlargement of the restricted area
- Vaccination of ovines
The presentation includes maps of the restricted areas and free zone. The
restricted areas are south of latitude 40. The following geographical
regions are included in the restricted areas:
Region 4 = Beira Interior (about 50 percent of surface, southern part);
Region 5 = Ribatejo e Oeste (about 50 percent of surface, southern part);
Region 6 = Alentejo (entire region);
Region 7 = Algarve (entire region).
The presentation includes also the following information on BTV vaccination
schemes carried out, so far, in Portugal:
1. Ovines
- In the protection zone, 2 Feb 2005 - 9 May 2005:
Live vaccine of serotype 4 (South Africa) was applied. Execution rate = 97
percent of animals in the zone.
- In the surveillance zone, 10 Nov 2005 - 24 Jan 2006: Inactivated vaccine
serotype 4 was applied. Execution rate = 98 percent.
- In the ex-protection zone, 7 Feb 2006 - 9 May 2006: Live vaccine of
serotype 4 (South Africa) was applied. Execution rate: 85 percent of
holdings, 87 percent of animals [see table 1 in slide 16 for the detailed
figures for each region].
Vaccination campaign in bovines (Inactivated vaccine):
1. Field trial of inactivated vaccine (serotypes 2 and 4), August - October
2005: About 4000 bovines vaccinated in the Region of Alentejo.
2. Serotype 4, December 2005 until July 2006: Low demand (no vector activity).
3. Serotype 4, July 2006 - September 2006. Fattening animals sent to the
free zone; final destiny: Slaughter within Portugal (vaccination registered
on the animal passports). Primary vaccination: Minimal age 3 months; 2
inoculations with 21-day interval and movement between 30 and 180 days
after 1st inoculation.
Total number vaccinated - 42 000 bovines (for data from each region, see
table in slide 17).

The epidemiological BT situation in Bulgaria as of 8 Nov 2006
-----------------------------------------------
The epidemiological BT situation in Bulgaria as of 8 Nov 2006 is favorable,
no clinical BT signs were revealed at the clinical examinations performed
on sheep in the municipalities of Burgas Region.
All serological tests of blood samples from cattle and goats taken for
routine testing under the 2006 BT Surveillance testing Program showed
negative results, except those ruminants originating from the border
villages of the municipality of Malko Tarnovo and Tsharevo, Region Burgas
(taken in all municipalities near the southern and western borders of the
country).
November weather forecast and expectations:
- On 3 Nov 2006, a cold air stream appeared on the territory of Bulgaria,
and the 1st snow fell;
- Temperatures drop in the country - 0 [below 0 C?];
- Retention of the low temperatures during the next week.
- No insects were caught by the light traps during the last week.
Additional activity:
152 additional blood tests (to those from the monitoring program) taken
from 14 villages situated within a 10-km zone far from the villages with
the seropositive cases;
Five new villages with seropositive cases in cattle and goats sampled on 5
Nov 2006 (table in slide 7):
1. 35 head of cattle, from 14 settlements; positive serology obtained in 2
cows from one settlement (Velika).
2. 118 goats in 13 settlements (the same as the above, but Velika not
included); positive serology obtained in 9 goats from 4 settlements:
Ahtopol (3/10); Tsarevo (1/20); Granichar (3/8); Belevren (2/10).
Ten blood samples with EDTA taken from serological positive cows for
virological examination;
Four samples for BT virus typing sent to the EU Reference laboratory for
Bluetongue, Pirbright.

[Four separate BTV cycles seem to be currently evolving in Europe: one in
the north caused by BTV-8, affecting cattle and sheep; a mid-southern one
(Sardinia) caused by BTV-1, affecting sheep; and -- reportedly, and
probably without noticeable clinical manifestation -- 2 other cycles, one
in the southeast (Bulgaria), the other one in the southwest (Portugal), as
described in the above text derived from their respective presentations in
Brussels. The BTV serotype(s) involved in their current Bulgarian and
Portuguese cycles have not yet been identified or reported. Previous BT
outbreaks in Bulgaria were caused by BTV-9 (1999); in 2002, sentinel goats
were found seropositive) and in Portugal by BTV-4 (2004-2005).
An updated (10 Nov 2006) map of the epizootic in Belgium, France, Germany
and the Netherlands is available at
