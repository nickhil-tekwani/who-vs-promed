Australia (NSW): Ross River Virus Alert for North Coast Tourists
----------------------------------------------------------------
A record outbreak of debilitating Ross River virus infection in holiday
meccas on the New South Wales (NSW) Far North Coast has prompted a call for
tourists to be warned that they may be endangering their health if they
visit. Byron Shire deputy mayor Jan Barham, herself battling the
mosquito-borne virus infection, said tourist operators and local government
must tell visitors of the risks of holidaying in places such as Byron Bay
and Tweed Heads. Her stand comes as health authorities reveal that cases of
Ross River virus infection and Barmah Forest virus (a related virus)
infection have reached alarming levels in the region. Northern Rivers Area
Health Service has released figures showing 370 cases of the 2 viruses are
being treated in the worst affected areas: Byron, Tweed and Lismore shires.
While not fatal, the fevers can hit sufferers with symptoms similar to
chronic fatigue syndrome, leaving them listless, constantly tired and with
ever-present aches and pains in the joints. Mosquitoes spread the viruses
after feeding on an infected animal or person before moving on to another
human. Councillor Barham, a member of the Greens party, said those who
encouraged visitors to the region, including the local tourist industry and
local government, had a duty of care to make sure tourists were not put at
risk. "People come here for a great sub-tropical experience, but they can
be left with a serious illness simply because they did not know they were
at risk of catching it," she said. But, she said, if tourists were advised
of the simple ways to prevent infection, the industry and the region's
economy did not have to suffer. She foreshadowed draft council regulations
making it compulsory for residential developments to have a buffer zone if
they are built near wetlands or flood-prone land. Sein Lowry, managing
director of the popular Byron Bay Arts Factory Backpackers Lodge, said his
staff provided insect repellent, mosquito coils and incense sticks to keep
the insects at bay. Another tourism operator, Jo-Ann Allchin of the
Seahorses Riding Centre at Byron Bay, said all her clients were given
insect repellent and were asked to wear long-sleeved tops and long pants.
Justine Waters, Director of Population Health at the area health service,
said the North Coast regularly recorded more than one-third of the Ross
River fever cases in NSW.

[Ross River virus is associated with epidemics of benign polyarthritis
often involving thousands of cases and is endemic in most coastal regions
and along inland waterways in Australia and beyond. A variety of wild and
domestic animals serve as reservoir hosts. Humans exhibit significant
viraemia and the virus can be maintained in some epidemics in a
human-mosquito-human transmission cycle. Different mosquito vectors are
important according to habitat. The incubation period for Ross River virus
infection is variable, from 2 to 21 days, and the illness is generally mild
although painful arthritis may persist for weeks and occasionally months.
Recovery is complete and there have been no fatalities.
_Ross River virus_ and _Barmah Forest virus_ are distinct virus species of
the genus _Alphavirus_ of the family _Togaviridae_. Clinically, Barmah
Forest virus causes a Ross River virus-like illness, which is generally
milder with a higher frequency of rash and a lower frequency of
arthralgias. The first epidemic of Barmah Forest virus disease occurred in
the Northern Territory in 1992. - Mod.CP]
