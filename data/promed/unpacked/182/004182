Dear Dr Blancou
Newcastle Disease in New South Wales - Western Sydney
I am reporting that virulent Newcastle Disease (ND) has been detected on a
small commercial layer farm in western Sydney, approximately 3 kms from the
initial infected farm in the September 1998 outbreak.
This incident involves a multi-age layer flock of 9045 birds. Preliminary
laboratory findings indicate that the ND isolated virus is probably of
Australian origin and not an incursion of an exotic strain, as was the case
with the 1998 western Sydney and the 1999 Mangrove Mountain region
outbreaks. Gene sequence studies are continuing.
[Meaning that those other outbreaks were *not* caused by exotic
strains - Mod,JW
New South Wales authorities have applied stamping out measures to this
infected farm and destruction of all birds was completed yesterday 22 August
1999.
The infected farm has been quarantined and movement restrictions imposed,
with a proclaimed infected zone of 3 km around the farm.
Surveillance is being conducted, laboratory and field investigations are
continuing and I shall keep you informed.
Kind regards
GARDNER MURRAY
Managing Director, National Offices
and Australian Chief Veterinary Officer
