https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-measures-have-all-but-wiped-out-the-flu-in-the-southern-hemisphere-11595440682


For the past 2 months, as winter descended on Chile, infectious disease specialist Claudia Cortes worked tirelessly to keep a wave of critically ill COVID-19 patients alive in the hospital where she works. At the same time, she worried about what would happen when the usual wave of influenza patients arrived.

They never came.

From Argentina to South Africa to New Zealand, countries in the Southern Hemisphere are reporting far lower numbers of influenza and other seasonal respiratory viral infections this year [2020]. In some countries, the flu seems to have all but disappeared, a surprise silver lining that health experts attribute to measures to corral the coronavirus, like mask use and restrictions on air travel.

The decline could be good news for health officials in the USA and Europe worried about a possible 2nd wave of coronavirus infections this fall and winter. Not only is the coronavirus more likely to spread as people gather indoors during cold weather, but it is also flu season, meaning hospitals could get a double whammy of influenza and COVID-19 patients, both of whom sometimes require intensive care treatment. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has warned that the fall and winter could see both respiratory epidemics -- COVID-19 and seasonal influenza -- circulating side by side, overwhelming hospitals. "I do think the fall and winter of 2020 and 2021 are going to be probably one of the most difficult times that we've experienced in American public health," Dr. Redfield told the Journal of the American Medical Association in early July 2020.

But the news from the Southern Hemisphere offers some hope. The decline isn't just for flu, but for other respiratory viruses as well, such as respiratory syncytial virus, which largely affects children, and pneumococcal disease. "We keep checking for the other viruses, but all we're seeing is COVID," said Dr. Cortes, the Chilean doctor. Of roughly 1300 COVID-19 patients she has treated since late March 2020, only a handful had the flu. "We were surprised by the decline in the other viruses like influenza. We never dreamed it would practically disappear," she said.

Chile has recorded only 1134 seasonal respiratory infections so far this year [2020], compared with 20 949 during the same period last year [2019]. In the first 2 weeks of July [2020] -- the equivalent to early January in the Northern Hemisphere and the height of the local flu season -- the country reported no new confirmed influenza cases. In the last 2 weeks of June [2020], Australia registered only 85 new laboratory-confirmed influenza cases, compared with 22 047 confirmed cases for the 2 weeks through [30 Jun 2019] a year earlier, according to Australia's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. In New Zealand, there are fewer hospitalizations than normal at this time of year, and the death rate has fallen.

"This [decline of other respiratory viruses] surprised me," said Dr. Sylvain Aldighieri, deputy director of the Department of Health Emergencies at the Pan American Health Organization, the Western Hemisphere arm of the World Health Organization. "We were expecting a double burden of cases, because in countries like Chile and Argentina, the flu winter epidemic places a high burden on healthcare services." Dr. Aldighieri, however, warned that without the strict containment measures taken by Southern Hemisphere countries, influenza would probably have returned as usual. He said hospitals and doctors in the USA and Europe should prepare for a normal flu season as their economies reopen and restrictions are lifted.

The Northern Hemisphere's influenza season can stretch from October to May. But by March of this year [2020], with COVID lockdowns in place in many countries, flu cases fell dramatically. The Southern Hemisphere is now seeing a similar drop-off in what is normally its peak flu season.

Many Southern Hemisphere countries took a range of steps to contain the coronavirus. Argentina, South Africa and New Zealand imposed strict lockdowns, while Australia allowed some businesses to stay open but restricted many others. Most countries banned large gatherings and closed schools, while citizens adopted frequent hand-washing, social distancing and wearing masks. Restricting incoming air travel helped Southern Hemisphere countries block one traditional source of infection: travelers arriving from the Northern Hemisphere at the end of the northern flu season in March and April. Those travelers could infect people in the south, where it would spread as the weather chilled. Countries including Chile, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand have barred international arrivals since March [2020]. "Strict border restrictions and alert level-based response including social-distancing measures have had an impact," said Dr. Sarah Jefferies, a public health physician at New Zealand's Institute of Environmental Science and Research, which monitors flu trends and provides data to the WHO. Since the USA and Europe haven't restricted international travel nearly as much, they will be more prone to having travelers import the flu, said Dr. Aldighieri.

Richard Medlicott, a general medical practitioner in a suburb of the New Zealand capital of Wellington, estimated the number of influenza patients had dropped at his clinic by 90% compared with last winter. For all types of respiratory illness, the decline was about 60%, he said. Dr. Medlicott said one big factor was having schools and child care centers closed. "Children are the main reservoir [of these viruses]," he said. "They haven't been at child care and that has meant they've had less chance to spread it in the community."

Habits intensified by the pandemic such as hand washing and new behaviors such as coughing into the elbow also helped contain the spread of flu and other respiratory diseases, he said. Some of these behaviors are likely to stick. Combined with increased use of medical consultations by video -- away from doctors' offices and hospitals where germs are prevalent -- that could suppress the flu in subsequent years, said Dr. Medlicott, a former medical director of the Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners.

Stepped-up vaccination for flu since the coronavirus pandemic began has also likely helped. Countries including Australia and Chile report far higher rates of vaccination than in previous years, as fears of coronavirus prompted elderly and other at-risk people to get the shots. Evidence that steps like social distancing also slowed other respiratory viruses first emerged in the Northern Hemisphere in March [2020], when the traditional flu season ended earlier than expected in countries ranging from Japan to the USA.

In Australia, influenza cases usually begin rising in March, April and May. Then, in June, "things really start to get going," said Professor Ian Barr, deputy director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, a nonprofit research center in Melbourne. But instead, the number of influenza cases has tapered off, from around 15% of the 5-year average in March [2020] to just 4% of the 5-year average in June [2020], he said. In Australia, confirmed flu cases plunged 84% to 20 739 from the beginning of January to 30 Jun [2020], compared with 132 424 during the same period the previous year [2019]. Dr. Rod Pearce, an Australia-based general practitioner who also works at a COVID-19 testing clinic near Adelaide, said his clinic has found only one positive flu case out of around 1000 tests done so far.

In Argentina, the number of laboratory-confirmed flu cases fell 64% to 151 189 from January [2020] through early July [2020], compared with an average of 420 737 during the same period the previous 5 years, according to government figures. "COVID has displaced all the other viruses, which makes me certain that it is far more transmissible," said Dr. Gustavo Lopardo, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the University of Buenos Aires.

Even in countries that have struggled to contain the virus, like Brazil, the winter flu season was far milder. Brazil has had more than 80 000 coronavirus-related deaths but saw flu cases fall by about 40% and flu deaths by half. In South Africa, which has been under a strict lockdown for 3 months, there were never enough flu cases to say a seasonal epidemic had begun, say doctors there. "We are certainly pushing the bounds of when it should have started now, so I think it's correct to assume that this is a real phenomenon," said Richard Lessells, an infectious disease specialist at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. The country of 60 million people usually sees some 50 000 severe flu cases a year, leading to around 12 000 deaths. Dr. Lessells said the low number of flu infections this year [2020] was likely due to steps to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and a government push for people to get the flu vaccine.

New Zealand's flu surveillance program indicates only 0.7% of the population had influenza-like symptoms such as fever and cough in the 1st week of July [2020], a fraction of the 3.0% to 4.3% range for the previous 2 years [2018 and 2019] in June and July. The decline has meant lower than normal hospitalizations overall, even with coronavirus patients counted. In the Auckland region, the weekly hospitalization rate was down to 2 people per 100 000 by mid-July [2020] compared with the long-term average of 8.5 for this time of year. It is also the lowest since a tracking program for acute respiratory infections began in the Auckland region in 2012. For influenza itself, there have been zero hospitalizations in the Auckland region -- home to one-third of New Zealanders -- since late March [2020]. Deaths have also fallen, by about 5% in the 1st half of the year compared with the previous year and are also down from 2018 and 2017. Researchers at the University of Otago said the reduced deaths are "unlikely to be a chance finding" and could be linked to several factors stemming from the lockdown, including lower levels of respiratory illness, fewer road crashes, reduced air pollution and a decline in fatal work accidents. However, the researchers said it is possible deaths will rebound later on due to factors such as delayed cancer treatment and higher unemployment, which is associated with increased suicide and cardiovascular disease. And in New Zealand, which has lifted virtually all coronavirus restrictions, Dr. Jefferies cautioned that there were still a few more months of winter and spring left and that greater economic activity could lead to an uptick in influenza in coming months, especially if people get careless about social distancing.

[Very interesting, somewhat unexpected observation. A 1st thought was wondering if failure to seek out medical care may be a confounding variable. But that being said, I doubt it would account for that large a decrease in cases. These are observational findings that merit systematic studying. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Japan: Increase in cases
Date: Fri 24 Jul 2020
Source: The New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/world/asia/japan-coronavirus.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur&fbclid=IwAR0UODFUr2OzCoGLZzQMl3z6kTKzM0-LgHhXEOGSli8cizJszcuEfy4v6Xo


The blame game can go only so far. For weeks, as Japan faced a troubling rise in coronavirus cases, officials pointed fingers at Tokyo's nightlife districts, especially the so-called host and hostess bars on the periphery of the country's sex industry. The message was clear: The rest of Japan was still doing fine, so its economic reopening should continue uninterrupted.

But that facade is quickly melting away. On Friday [24 Jul 2020], Japan reported close to 1000 new infections -- the most in a single day since the pandemic began -- with cases surfacing across the country. This month [July 2020], clusters have been found in nursing homes, schools and a Tokyo theater. And, in a worrisome sign, an increasing number have no traceable links.

Despite the growing outbreaks, the Japanese government has so far resisted a return to the kinds of restrictions being imposed in places like Hong Kong and Australia as their caseloads, which had previously subsided, spiral up again.

Tokyo officials -- who announced a record total of 366 cases on Thursday [23 Jul 2020] -- have not asked karaoke bars or nightclubs to close as they did under a state of emergency in April [2020]. The central government has pressed ahead with a domestic tourism campaign, although it bowed to pressure to exclude travelers to and from Tokyo. Officials have maintained this no-going-back approach even as the nation reached a total of 27 956 active cases on Friday [24 Jul 2020], a figure nearly 50% higher than at the beginning of the month [July 2020].

"We are seeing the early phase of exponential growth," said Kenji Shibuya, director of the Institute for Population Health at King's College London and a member of a coronavirus task force assembled by the Japan Medical Association. "If they don't act promptly and try to contain it as fast as possible," he said, the virus could spin out of control. When Tokyo announced its record case count on Thursday [23 Jul 2020], Gov. Yuriko Koike acknowledged that infections had been detected across the city and were not limited to the nightlife hot spots that have been the subject of hectoring media coverage.

Yet in what business owners describe as scapegoating, the central government and Ms. Koike have talked of dispatching police officers to bars and nightclubs to help monitor social distancing and other hygiene measures.

Part of the reason the government remains sanguine about the uptick in cases is that deaths have remained relatively low: just over 1000 in a country of close to 127 million people. Japan has been held up as a model of infection control, with most residents wearing masks everywhere. Offices and stores put bottles of hand sanitizer at entrances and make efforts to shield workers and customers behind plastic sheeting.

The majority of recent cases -- as in other countries that have experienced a rebound in infections -- have been among people in their 20s and 30s, who tend to suffer only mild symptoms. On Thursday [23 Jul 2020], Ms. Koike said that about 1 in 7 of the Tokyo cases were asymptomatic.

But other indicators are more unsettling. The number of serious cases -- patients requiring ventilators -- has doubled in less than a week in Tokyo. And experts say that the young may eventually spread the virus to older people and others at risk of getting seriously ill. Now, the virus "is mainly among young populations, but it will shift toward people in their 40s and 50s and may even end up in the more vulnerable populations such as those in their 70s and 80s," said Kentaro Iwata, an infectious disease specialist at Kobe University Hospital. "You can't really isolate the younger population from elderly people," he said.

This pattern of the young passing the virus on to older populations, Dr. Iwata said, "was evidently seen in many parts of the USA," where communities opened up and younger people hit the bars, restaurants and beaches, sparking outbreaks.

Until recently, Japan has been viewed as something of an outlier in the pandemic. Despite having the world's highest proportion of elderly people and contending with a severe early outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, Japan has puzzled experts as it managed to contain the virus and avoid huge death tolls without imposing strict lockdowns. Some physicians say they see no reason that the latest outbreaks will change that, in part because of the underlying health of the population.

"Compared to other countries, we don't have as many 'fatties,'" said Dr. Hiroyuki Kunishima, professor of infectious diseases at St. Marianna University School of Medicine in Tokyo. "The people who will have the heaviest conditions after contracting the virus are the fat people, smokers and people with pre-existing conditions." He said that the seasonal flu was a much bigger concern in Japan. Japan's obesity rate is about 4%, compared to more than 40% in the USA. But 18% of the adult population in Japan smokes regularly, compared with about 14% in the USA. And Japan actually has a slightly higher rate of diabetes, one of the underlying conditions that have been associated with coronavirus morbidity.

The Japanese public has grown increasingly concerned about the recent record-setting caseloads. According to a poll by Kyodo News, two-thirds of the public wants the government to impose another state of emergency, under which businesses were asked to restrict operations and people were asked to work from home and make only essential trips. On Friday [24 Jul 2020], Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said there was no reason for the government to do so again. In some ways, it has gone in the opposite direction. In a speech about the contentious travel campaign this week, Mr. Abe cited the importance of reviving the economy, as the slowdown in international travel has severely hobbled Japan's tourism industry.

The government also announced this month [July 2020] that sports and music venues could allow up to 5000 people to attend events, as long as capacity was limited to 50%.

Officials say that the public health authorities can control the spread of the virus by quickly isolating clusters. When a positive case is identified, the patient is asked to list recent contacts, who are then tested. If any of them test positive, they are either hospitalized or asked to quarantine at home for 14 days, if they have a mild case. Dr. Shibuya said that such retrospective testing may have worked in the early days of the pandemic, but that a broader approach was now necessary. Japan has consistently performed tests at well under its stated capacity: It says it can conduct as many as 30 000 a day, but it has more recently conducted fewer than 15 000 on a daily basis, and some days much fewer.

Without more testing, "you can't separate those who are infected from those who are not," Dr. Shibuya said. "If you delay testing until the onset of major symptoms, it's too late." The authorities have stepped up targeted testing in some of the nightlife districts. Kaori Kohga, head of the Nightlife Business Association, which represents hostess clubs, said it was unfair of the government to single out the industry.

"I would like to urge politicians, instead of stirring up such divisive ideas, to instead look for fundamental solutions," Ms. Kohga said. She said national guidelines for how to protect workers and customers were unrealistic, such as asking customers to stay 6 feet from hostesses or other customers. Many of the clubs, Ms. Kohga said, operate in small spaces and could have no more than 2 customers at a time under the recommendations. As a result of the negative attention, she said, business has dropped significantly, and some clubs have had to close, throwing employees -- many of whom are young women with few other options -- out of work.

Dr. Shibuya said he was worried that the government was downplaying the risks that the country could be facing a more severe contagion. "Japan shouldn't be so complacent," he said, "because we have been lucky."

[Denial is the SARS-CoV-2 best friend as it permeates a geographic area in a stealth manner until the "explosive" stage occurs when individuals at high risk of serious disease are infected. It is starting to unfold now in Japan -- a society that has no problems accepting using face masks, but like elsewhere in the world the 20- to 30-year-olds think they are invincible and are forgoing social distancing.

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges with SARS-CoV-2 infections, but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters and temporary new restrictions have impacted. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly with major resurgences. - Mod.MPP]

[4] WHO situation report 186 (as of 24 Jul 2020)
Date: Fri 24 Jul 2020
Source: WHO [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200724-covid-19-sitrep-186.pdf


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 24 Jul 2020.

Highlights
----------
- Dr. Tedros, in his media briefing yesterday [23 Jul 2020], reminded people not to let their guard down "we will not be going back to the 'old normal'. The pandemic has already changed the way we live our lives. Part of adjusting to the 'new normal' is finding ways to live our lives safely."

- As the possibility of a protracted pandemic becomes increasingly likely, countries are encouraged to conduct periodic reviews of their national and subnational COVID-19 response. This ensures that countries do not miss critical opportunities for learning and improvement to better respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. WHO has produced guidance to assist in this exercise.

- At the annual High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development held 7-16 Jul 2020, all countries expressed their support for the SDGs and discussed response measures to help mitigate the negative effects of COVID-19.

- Ouagadougou: WHO is tackling COVID-19 fear and stigma in Burkina Faso, West Africa, where both patients and health workers have been shunned by their communities.

- For Somalis, COVID-19 is the most immediate crisis in a seemingly unending cycle of floods, food insecurity, conflict and outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, cholera and polio. Against this backdrop, WHO's polio programme is working to steer the COVID-19 response and, more broadly, maintain vaccine immunity levels and improve access to health care.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 60.9% of the global newly reported cases and 78.6% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 7.9 million cases. The USA reported 40.2% (69 641) of cases, Brazil 39.2% (67 860), Colombia 4.3% (7390), Mexico 3.5% (6019), Argentina 3.3% (5782), Peru 2.6% (4463), and Chile 1.4% (2357).

- The European region reported 7.9% of the global newly reported cases and 4.6% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 25.8% (5811) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Spain 11.6% (2615), Kazakhstan 7.5% (1687), Romania 4.9% (1112), Ukraine 4.3% (972), Kyrgyzstan 4.1% (921), Turkey 4.1% (913), and France 4.1% (945). Spain's 14-day population-based incidence rate has gone from a low of 7.74 per 100 000 population on 25 Jun 2020 to 37.94 today (24 Jul 2020), continuing to increase on a daily basis (calculated from the daily spreadsheet we maintain with data from https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/documentos/Actualizacion_169_COVID-19.pdf) and Italy has increased its 7-day average by 22.2% over the preceding 7-day period, a sign there are increases in transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 (calculated from the daily spreadsheet we maintain with data from http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioContenutiNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=5351&area=nuovoCoronavirus&menu=vuoto).

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.7% of the global newly reported cases and 4.9% of global newly reported fatalities. Iran reported 19.8% (2621) of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iraq 17.8% (2361), Saudi Arabia 16.9% (2238), Pakistan 9.1% (1209), Oman 8.3% (1009), Kuwait 5.2% (687), Egypt 5.0% (668), Palestinian Authority 4.5% (596), Qatar 2.8% (373), and Bahrain 2.7% (359). Pakistan is decreasing its daily case count steadily during the month of July 2020, while at the same time cases are increasing in Iraq and Oman. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a surge mode.

- The African region reported 6.0% of the global newly reported cases and 2.2% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 77.3% (13 104) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Kenya 4.7% (796), Algeria 3.6% (612), Nigeria 3.6% (604), and Ethiopia 2.4% (409). Since the beginning of July 2020, South Africa has reported daily new case counts of greater than 10 000 15 of the 24 days.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.4% of the global newly reported cases and 0.38% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 52.8% (2121) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 23.1% (927), Australia 10.2% (410), Singapore 8.8% (354), China 3.5% (139), and South Korea 1.0% (41). Japan has been steadily increasing daily case counts over the past week.

- The South East Asia region reported 19.1% of the global newly reported cases and 9.3% of global deaths. India reported 90.9% (49 310) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 5.3% (2856) and Indonesia 3.5% (1906). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions.

[Comparing today's numbers with yesterday's (23 Jul 2020), the global case count rose by 1.8% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts, although India has been rapidly increasing, with daily case counts around 50 000. At this rate of daily new confirmations, the global tally will pass the 16 million mark by tomorrow [25 Jul 2020].

In the past 24 hours, the USA reported a record high of 78 336 cases, followed by Brazil (58 249) and India (48 892). These 3 countries account for almost half of all confirmed cases globally (49.8%). There were 6237 deaths reported in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, India, South Africa, Mexico, Colombia, Russia, Argentina, Peru, and Bangladesh -- global hotspots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 2548 to 78 336. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Chile, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Philippines, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Israel and the Dominican Republic -- their range of reported new cases is 1462 to 2545.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 11.9%, and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is increased by 18.4%.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality. That being said, the most severely affected region is the Americas with cases increasing on a daily basis, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.MPP]
