Scientists are trying to figure out what killed more than 50 seagulls found
on Volusia County beaches since Friday, and why another 60 sick birds have
required treatment for apparent respiratory illness. [Volusia County is on
the central eastern coast of Florida, and includes Daytona Beach.] The
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has agreed to perform necropsies, or animal
autopsies, on the seagulls at their Oregon laboratories to determine a
cause of death, agent Joe Oliveros said.
Experts surmise that the dead birds could have died after they ate fish
contaminated with salmonella, contracted a virus, or encountered something
toxic. The birds could also have died from an exhausting migration. About
20 of them have died since being brought in, said Dee Ann Snyder, who is
licensed to rehabilitate birds. Snyder says it's common for some seagulls
to die after migrating south from as far as the Arctic, but the number of
cases since Friday worries her. She says she typically treats 100 to 125
seagulls a year, but she has treated 58 since Friday.
