[The definition of the designations deaths, definite cases, probable
vCJD cases, and the case definitions can be found by accessing the
Department of Health website, or, by reference to a previous
ProMED-mail post in this thread (for example, CJD (new var.) - UK:
update March 2002 20020305.3693).
Data on vCJD cases from other parts of the world are now included in
these updates whenever available.
Also, data on other forms of CJD (sporadic, iatrogenic, familial and
GSS) are now included when they have some relevance to the incidence
and etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

The Department of Health is today [Mon 7 Aug 2006] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt Jakob
disease. This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of
the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy).
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK, as of Fri 4 Aug 2006:
-----------------------------------------------
Summary of vCJD Cases - Deaths
-----------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 112
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 44
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 156
Summary of vCJD Cases - Alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 6
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 162
(The next table will be published on Mon 4 Sep 2006).
[Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Mon 30 Jun
2006, although the number of probable cases has increased by one, the
total number of deaths from definite vCJD remains unchanged at 156.
The number of vCJD cases still alive has increased by one, therefore,
the overall total number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and
alive) is increased by one and becomes 162.
These data are consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the
UK is now in decline. The number of deaths due to definite or
probable vCJD in the UK during the 12 months of 2005 remains 5. The
peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in
2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, and 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, and so far 3
in 2006. - Mod.CP]
Totals for All Types of CJD Cases in the UK during 2005 & 2006
-----------------------------------------------
As of 4 Aug 2006, in the UK in the year 2005, there were 122
referrals of suspected CJD, and there were 64 deaths from sporadic
CJD, 6 from familial CJD, 3 from iatrogenic CJD, 6 GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker) syndrome cases, and 5 deaths from
vCJD.
The corresponding figures so far for the 1st 7 months of 2006 are: 62
referrals, 33 deaths from sporadic CJD, 3 from vCJD, 3 from familial
CJD, one from GSS and none from iatrogenic CJD.

[2] UK: Pentosan polysulphate treatment prolongs survival

Study Indicates Pentosan Polysulphate Prolongs Survival in CJD
-----------------------------------------------
An experimental treatment for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) may
prolong life but does not seem to halt progressive deterioration of
the brain, a study of 7 British patients who took the drug has found.
Pentosan polysulphate, widely prescribed in pill form around the
world for urological conditions, is infused directly into the brain
of patients with CJD. Ian Bone, a Glasgow neurologist, did the study
on behalf of the Medical Research Council. Of the 7 patients, 3 had
variant CJD (vCJD, contracted from bovine spongiform encephalopathy);
2 had iatrogenic prion disease from growth hormone; and 2 had the
hereditary form of CJD. All were aged under 35. Three of the 7 died
before the study's end.
Professor Bone told the BMJ that his findings indicated, but did not
prove, that the drug prolongs survival. "The average survival in vCJD
is generally believed to be about 13 months."

[Pentosan polysulphate (poly-b-xylose-2,3-disulphonate) is a large
polysulphonated polyglycoside. The drug is relatively inexpensive,
made from beechwood, and has been used since the 1960s as an
anticoagulant, in a similar way to heparin, also a polysulphonated
polyglycoside. It is currently used in North America for treating
interstitial cystitis but is not licensed in the United Kingdom.
Animal studies have shown that injecting the drug into the brains of
animals infected with scrapie, a disease closely related to CJD,
slowed the accumulation of prions, the infectious particles
implicated in transmission and progression of CJD. It has been
suggested that pentosan binds to heparan-binding sites on infectious
prion proteins, potentially inhibiting further prion production. The
drug has to be given directly into the brain because it is unable to
cross the blood brain barrier.
In October 2002 the Committee on the Safety of Medicines felt unable
to recommend the use of pentosan polysulphate in vCJD because of the
absence of in vitro or in vivo data relevant to vCJD and the lack of
information on the basic pharmacology of the drug, including its mode
of action in this indication. - Mod.CP]
