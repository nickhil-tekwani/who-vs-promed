Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome outbreak at fur farm in Udmurtia
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The number of workers at a fur farm in the Mozhayskiy District of
Udmurtia admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of hemorrhagic fever
with renal syndrome (HFRS) has reached 16. Specialists predict a
further increase in the number of HFRS cases. Airborne transmission
of infection during the processing of fur pelts from slaughtered
animals is though to be the source of the infection.

[The removal of fat from] skins at the fur farm is carried out using
sawdust obtained from a storehouse in a nearby forest area. According
to Nailya Bogdanova, a pest control specialist in the infection
control department of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Services for Consumer
Protection and Human Welfare), it is likely that forest rodents [the
vector of HFRS] live in the stored sawdust. At least 100 persons are
engaged in the processing of the furs of the slaughtered animals;
consequently it is likely that the number of cases of HFRS will
increase.

[HFRS is caused by a hantavirus, with a reservoir in wild rodents, and
a 3-4 year cycle following fluctuations in the rodent population --
note the last outbreaks were in 2004 (see ProMED refs. below. For
further details of the virus and the epidemiological situation in
Udmurtia, see the 1st ProMED ref. below. - Mod.JW]

[Udmurtia is a sovereign republic within the Russian Federation. It
is situated in the western part of the Middle Urals between the Kama
and Vyatka rivers. A map showing the location of the Republic of
Udmurtia is accessible at
