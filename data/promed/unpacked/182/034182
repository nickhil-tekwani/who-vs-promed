Bird flu found in flocks in 2 more US states
--------------------------------------------
A strain of bird flu which is devastating to commercial chicken flocks but
not harmful to humans has spread into Pennsylvania, and more cases may be
found in Delaware, agriculture officials in both states said on Thursday.
The disease was also confirmed in 4 small poultry markets in north eastern
New Jersey, a state which has had the disease for a dozen years and does
not have any large, commercial flocks, according to its state officials.
The H7 avian influenza in the 3 states is a different strain from the H5N1
virus that has devastated flocks in 10 nations in Asia. Some 19 people have
died in that outbreak. "The single take-home message is that the form of
avian influenza in New Jersey is not a human health threat," said state
health commissioner Clifton Lacy.
Because avian influenza is spread easily, authorities often quarantine
infected farms and destroy their birds. A dozen nations have banned all or
some US poultry shipments since the first infected flock was found [during
the 2nd week of February 2004] in Delaware. Chicken accounts for 1/3 of US
meat consumption. The government estimates each American will consume 82.5
pounds of chicken in 2004.
The Pennsylvania infection was found in a flock of nearly 500 000
egg-producing hens, which was immediately quarantined. The birds, which
have not shown any physical signs of illness, may be depopulated depending
on further testing. "We have a flock that has tested positive in Lancaster
County," Pennsylvania Agriculture Secretary Dennis Wolff told Reuters. "It
is still undecided whether to depopulate."
Some 16 poultry flocks within a 2 mile radius of the infected Pennsylvania
farm will undergo testing for the virus. Wolff said the strain of bird flu
in the Pennsylvania chickens was not yet determined but he thought it was
likely to be the same as that which was found in Delaware. Avian influenza
was last found in Pennsylvania in 2002, he said.
Farmers fear the disease because it can rapidly spread throughout a flock,
cutting egg production and producing misshapen or soft-shelled eggs. Bird
flu is spread through the birds' feces or mouth secretions and can infect
turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks, geese, and migratory birds.
The disease is so contagious that Delaware officials have asked farmers to
post "keep out" signs on their property, to stop taking tractors and farm
equipment to auction, and to have essential visitors wear disposable
biosecurity clothing.
In Delaware, a major producer of chickens for companies such as Tyson Foods
Inc., officials said they hoped the disease was contained but could not
rule out more cases. No new cases have been found in tests of 36 of the 80
or so poultry houses within 6 miles of the 2 infected flocks. "We are
cautiously optimistic because no new cases of Avian Influenza have been
discovered," said Delaware agriculture secretary Michael Scuse, adding, "We
realize that due to the fact that the virus is easily spread among
chickens, it is entirely possible that we may see more cases." Scuse asked
the public to stay away from poultry farms in order to reduce the chance of
the virus spreading. "We have made arrangements with state and local
enforcement agencies to maintain strict biosecurity on all poultry farms,"
he said.
New Jersey officials said they discovered avian influenza during annual
testing of the markets within miles of New York City. At the live markets,
buyers select chickens to be killed and then take them home to cook. The
live poultry markets in New Jersey and New York sell relatively small
numbers of chickens. The US broiler industry sends more than 8.6 billion
birds to slaughter annually.

[The specific strain of avian influenza virus detected in chickens on the
first premises (the noncommercial farm, announced 6 Feb 2004) has been
identified as H7N2 by the USDA APHIS, Veterinary Services, National
Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, IA. Basically, all of the
isolates sequenced thus far are identical to each other and to recent H7N2
viruses that have been isolated from fowl in the live-bird markets in the
north eastern US over the past several years. The sequence at the cleavage
site is PEKPKPR/GLF, one that is consistent with low pathogenicity.
Pathogenicity testing in chickens (takes about 10 days) is currently under
way at the NVSL, and results are expected before the end of next week. The
diagnosis of H7 in the commercial flock identified on 10 Feb 2004 was made
using rapid ("Directigen" and RT PCR) and AGID testing. Confirmatory
testing is being conducted at the NVSL. Low mortality rates in this second
flock indicate that a low-pathogenicity strain of avian influenza virus
also may be involved. Sequencing results are expected within 24 hours to
identify the strain of virus and to indicate pathogenicity characteristics.
ProMED-mail extends grateful appreciation to Dr Tom Walton of the USDA for
this information. ­ Mod.TG]
