Both sides in Syria's bloody civil war said Saturday [12 Apr 2014] that a rural village fell victim to a poison gas attack, an assault that reportedly injured scores of people amid an ongoing international effort to rid the country of chemical weapons.

What exactly happened on Friday [11 Apr 2014] in Kfar Zeita, a rebel-held village in Hama province some 125 miles north of Damascus, remains unclear and likely won't be known for some time. It took United Nations weapons inspectors months to say that it was likely that some chemical weapons attacks happened last year [2013], including an August 2013 attack that killed hundreds and nearly sparked Western air strikes against President Bashar Assad's forces.

But online videos posted by rebel activists from Kfar Zeita echoed earlier images that sparked a world outcry, showing pale-faced men, women and children gasping for breath at a field hospital. They suggest an affliction by some kind of poison, and yet, this is another clouded incident where both sides blame each other in a conflict that activists say has killed more than 150 000 people with no end in sight.

The main Western-backed opposition group, the Syrian National Coalition, said the poison gas attack hurt dozens of people, though it did not identify the gas used.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group that relies on a network of on-the-ground volunteers, said the gas attack happened during air raids that left heavy smoke over the area. It reported that people suffered from suffocation and breathing problems after the attack but gave no further details.

State-run Syrian television blamed members of the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front rebel group for the attack, saying they used chlorine gas to kill 2 people and injure more than 100. It did not say how it confirmed chlorine was used.

Chlorine, one of the most commonly manufactured chemicals in the U.S., is used to purify drinking water. But as a gas, it can be deadly, with the German army using it in warfare in World War I. The Geneva Protocol of 1925, which Syria signed, banned its use in battle.

The TV report also claimed the Nusra Front is preparing for another chemical attack against the Wadi Deif area in the northern province of Idlib, as well as another area in Hama. The government station did not explain how it knew of the Nusra Front's plans.

Activists in the village could not be reached on Saturday [12 Apr 2014].

An activist from Hama who is currently in Turkey and is in contact with residents told The Associated Press that the attack occurred around sunset on Friday [11 Apr 2014]. The man said the air raids on the rebel-held village came as nearby areas including Morek and Khan Sheikhoun have witnessed intense clashes between troops and opposition fighters.

An amateur video posted online by opposition activists showed a hospital room in Kfar Zeita that was packed with men and children, some of whom were breathing through oxygen masks. On one bed, the video showed 6 children, some appearing to have difficulty breathing while others cried. The video appeared genuine and corresponded to other AP reporting of the attack.

Chemical weapons have been used before in Syria's 3-year-old conflict. In August 2013, a chemical attack near the capital, Damascus, killed hundreds of people. The U.S. and its allies blamed the Syrian government for that attack, which nearly sparked Western air strikes before a negotiated diplomatic settlement saw Assad's government agree to give up its chemical weapons. Damascus denied the charges and blamed rebels for staging the incident.

Before the August 2013 attack, there were several incidents of toxic gases being used. Britain, France and the U.S. have spoken about chemical weapons use in the central city of Homs, Damascus and elsewhere. A U.N. weapons inspectors' report released in December 2013 identified 4 locations where chemical weapons likely had been used in 2013: Khan al Assal outside Aleppo, Jobar in Damascus' eastern suburbs, Saraqueb near Idlib in the northwest, and Ashrafiah Sahnaya in the Damascus countryside. In 2 cases, inspectors reportedly found "signatures of sarin," a nerve agent.

The Syrian National Coalition called on the U.N. to conduct a "quick investigation into the developments related to the use of poisonous gas against civilians in Syria." The coalition also claimed that another chemical weapons attack on Friday [11 Apr 2014] struck the Damascus suburb of Harasta, though state media did not report on it.

In Washington, the State Department said Friday [11 Apr 2014] that the U.S. had no information to corroborate the latest claims of a gas attack. Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said she would not speculate on any U.S. response if the reports were found to be accurate.

The chemical weapons attack in August 2013 caused an international outcry. A coalition was formed to eliminate the weapons and now aims to remove and destroy 1300 metric tons of chemicals held by the Assad government by 30 Jun 2014.

Syria's government missed a 31 Dec 2014 deadline to remove the most dangerous chemicals in its stockpile and a 5 Feb 2014 deadline to give up its entire stockpile of chemical weapons. Assad's government cited security concerns and the lack of some equipment but has repeated that it remains fully committed to the process.

Meanwhile, violence continued Saturday [12 Apr 2014] elsewhere in Syria. In the northern city of Aleppo, Syria's largest and one-time commercial center, the Observatory and state television reported intense clashes, mostly near a main intelligence office in the city's contested neighborhood of Zahra.

Syrian state news agency SANA reported earlier Saturday [12 Apr 2014] that several mortar shells hit the government-held neighborhoods of Hamidiyeh and Khaldiyeh, killing at least 6 people and wounding 15.

Aleppo became a key front in the country's civil war after rebels launched an offensive there in July 2012.

The government and opposition forces in Syria have accused each other of using poison gas in an attack on a village on Friday [11 Apr 2014].

State TV said the jihadist Nusra Front group launched the attack on Kafr Zita in Hama province, killing 2 people and injuring dozens of others. But opposition groups quoted doctors as saying that an attack by regime planes led to suffocation and poisoning. There was no independent verification of either of the claims.

"Regime planes bombed Kafr Zita with explosive barrels that produced thick smoke and odours and led to cases of suffocation and poisoning," said Rami Abdel Rahman, from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

State-run television blamed the attack on the Nusra Front and said they had information that the jihadist group was planning to attack 2 more towns. "There is information that the terrorist Nusra Front released toxic chlorine ... leading to the deaths of 2 people and causing more than 100 people to suffer from suffocation," it said.

In a separate incident, the Al-Arabiya TV news network also reported on Friday [11 Apr 2014] that there were a number of cases of suffocation in Harasta, a northeastern suburb of Damascus. An opposition group was quoted by the news channel as saying the incident came "after the regime bombarded it with poisonous gas."

In August last year [2013], a chemical attack near the capital killed hundreds of people. The US and its allies blamed the Syrian government for that attack, which nearly sparked Western air strikes against President Bashar Assad's forces. The government denied responsibility, in turn blaming the rebels, but Damascus agreed under threat of US military action to turn over its chemical weapons stockpile for destruction.

[Both of these articles reference the same event. Both articles are provided ultimately by the Associated press, but there is slightly different, and at some points conflicting information. There is, in my mind, a difference between 100 being injured and a few dozen (perhaps 3 dozen or 36 people).

While there is the statement that the video appears authentic, there has been no confirmation. However, many major news outlets had the videos on line and on major stations this morning (13 Apr 2014).

The type of gas involved has not been determined. Mention is made of chlorine gas, which may be yellowish or greenish and may be close to ground when visible, but this has not been verified. However, mild doses may be recovered, and that may be what is seen in the videos of the children.

In searching the web, there have been no other reports other than similar versions of these 2 and all from the Associated Press.

While it is our policy to report such events as an early warning system against bioterrorism, this report remains unverified and may be misinformation that the Associated Press has perhaps been duped into publishing, or, it may be quite accurate and will be verified. Therefore, as an early warning system against chemical weapons, we are reporting these events here.
