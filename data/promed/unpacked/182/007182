Kyrgyzstan: Typhoid cases reported in south
-------------------------------------------
5 patients have been hospitalized in southern Kyrgyzstan with typhoid
in a town near radioactive dump sites.
"8 local residents have been hospitalized over
the past week in the Mailuu-Suu town in the
southern province of Jalal-Abad, and we have 5
confirmed cases, the rest are ordinary diarrhea
instances," officials at a local sanitary and
epidemiological surveillance center said from
Jalal-Abad on Mon 20 Feb 2006. "All of them are
residents of the upper area of Mailuu-Suu known
as Koktash settlement," they added.
With a population of some 25 000, Mailuu-Suu, 100
km northwest of the provincial capital
Jalal-Abad, is known for its radioactive uranium
dumps, a legacy of the Soviet Union's uranium
mining program in the area.
Local doctors cite contaminated water as the
source of infection. Paramedics in the area are
currently busy looking for other residents who
had been in contact with those already diagnosed
with the disease. Their number is some 260,
according to local doctors.
"Generally, typhoid cases surface during hot
summer months, but in this case, it happened
right in the middle of winter," town mayor
Bumayram Mamaseitova said. "There is a constant
and acute lack of clean drinking water in
Koktash. We had been supplying drinking water to
residents there by trucks both in summer and
autumn. However, our local budget cannot carry
that burden anymore, while the local population
does not want to pay for water," she explained.
"The main issue is the reconstruction of the
town's water supply and sewage networks, which
were installed some 60 years ago. The networks
have become antiquated and run down since then,"
local experts explained, adding that frequent
leakages in the system were the source of water
contamination.

Typhoid claims 1st victim
-------------------------
The deadly disease typhoid, which broke out in
the city during the beginning of February 2006,
has claimed its 1st victim.
A 19-year-old woman was suffering from the
symptoms of the epidemic for the last week and
was taking treatment at home, but when her
condition became serious with high fever, she was
admitted to Vikram Hospital. She died on Thu 16
Feb 2006.
The epidemic was detected on 13 Feb 2006, when
the Corporation Health Officials found out that
the water pipe in the Under Ground Drainage (UGD)
route on Manandavadi Road was getting mixed up
with the drainage water from a pipe which runs
parallel to it. The Corporation had taken up a
survey to locate places where water pipes and UGD
lines pass side by side.
After the epidemic spread to other parts in the
city, district Health officials collected the
blood samples of patients, and typhoid was
confirmed. The District Health and Family Welfare
Officer Dr. Krishnaswamy said that the water
samples from the affected areas were tested for
bacteriological contamination. It was confirmed
that the water was not fit for human consumption.
He regretted that, even after sending daily
reports of water contamination to the City
Corporation, immediate steps have not been taken.

Residents told not to panic over typhoid fever outbreak
-------------------------------------------------------
Mr. Phuti Seloba, provincial spokesperson for the
Department of Health and Social Development, said
on Wed 8 Feb 2006 that residents need not panic
with regard to an outbreak of typhoid fever.
Following up on a tip from a member of the public
to investigate a confirmed case of typhoid fever
at the Louis Trichardt Memorial Hospital, the
Zoutpansberger's investigation revealed 12
confirmed cases of typhoid fever in and around
town over a period of 3 weeks. 4 of the patients
who tested positive for the disease live in town,
while the other patients are from Sinthumule,
Tshikwarani, Indermark, Madombidzha, Magau and
Munzhedzi. A couple of months ago, an outbreak of
this deadly disease caused several deaths at
Delmas in Mpumalanga.

[4] Greece (Ancient Plague of Athens)

Typhoid was disease that ended Athens's golden age
--------------------------------------------------
In 430 BC, a great epidemic broke out in Athens
that killed a 3rd of the city, ending the golden
age of Athenian dominance of the ancient world.
There has been speculation that the cause was
smallpox, anthrax or even measles. Now, genetic
analysis indicates the culprit was typhoid fever.
Greek scientists writing in the International
Journal of Infectious Diseases say they solved
"(one of) the most debated enigmas in medical
history" by studying DNA recovered from the teeth
of skeletal remains in an ancient mass burial pit.
The pit has more than 5 layers of skeletons
buried in a precise manner, topped with bodies
"virtually heaped one upon the other," suggesting
a quick burial in difficult conditions.
After extracting the trace dental DNA, the
researchers used new techniques to amplify and
compare it with genetic sequences from diseases
such as plague, typhus, anthrax, tuberculosis and
cat-scratch disease. They found a match with
typhoid fever.
The great plague occurred in the 1st years of the
Peloponnesian War, which eventually led to
Sparta's defeat of Athens. At the time, Athens
was surrounded on land by Spartans and survived
only because its navy controlled the sea through
the port of Piraeus.
The city's great leader, Pericles, died in the
epidemic. In his famous history of that war,
Thucydides described the plague as including
fever, rash and diarrhea. All are consistent with
typhoid fever, which is spread by contaminated
water and food.
[The abstract of the article which is in press in
the International Journal of Infectious Diseases,
the journal of ProMED's parent organization, the
International Society for Infectious Diseases, is
shown below:
Background:
Until now, in the absence of direct
microbiological evidence, the cause of the Plague
of Athens has remained a matter of debate among
scientists who have relied exclusively on
Thucydides to introduce several possible
diagnoses. A mass burial pit, unearthed in the
Kerameikos ancient cemetery of Athens and dated
back to the time of the plague outbreak (around
430 BC), has provided the required skeletal
material for the investigation of ancient
microbial DNA.
Objective:
To determine the probable cause of the Plague of Athens.
Method:
Dental pulp was our material of choice, since it
has been proven to be an ideal DNA source of
ancient septicemic microorganisms through its
good vascularization, durability and natural
sterility.
Results:
6 DNA amplifications targeted at genomic parts of
the agents of plague (_Yersinia pestis_), typhus
(_Rickettsia prowazekii_), anthrax (_Bacillus
anthracis_), tuberculosis (_Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_), cowpox (cowpox virus) and
cat-scratch disease (_Bartonella henselae_)
failed to yield any product in suicideï¿½ reactions
of DNA samples isolated from 3 ancient teeth. On
the 7th such attempt, DNA sequences of
_Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhi were
identified providing clear evidence for the
presence of that microorganism in the dental pulp
of teeth recovered from the Kerameikos mass grave.
Conclusion:
The results of this study clearly implicate
typhoid fever as a probable cause of the Plague
of Athens.
