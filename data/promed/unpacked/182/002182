Polio case at Hagadera Refugee Camp, Garissa District, Kenya
-----------------------------------------------
A polio case has been identified in Hagadera Refugee Camp in Dadaab
Division of Garissa District in North Eastern Province of Kenya.
A 3-year-old female presented on 18 Sep 2006 at Hagadera Refugee Hospital
with a 4-day history of fever followed by paralysis of the lower limbs. She
was admitted to the hospital, and a diagnosis of acute flaccid paralysis
was made. At the same time, her younger sibling was admitted to the
hospital with fever but without any paralysis.
Stool specimens were taken on 21 and 22 Sep 2006 and sent to Kenya Medical
Research Institute (KEMRI) Polio Reference Laboratory in Nairobi, and after
initial investigations, the specimens were sent to the World Health
Organization Regional Reference Virology Laboratory in South Africa for
intratypic differentiation, and on 13 Oct 2006, results were received from
South Africa. Wild polio virus type 1 was isolated; the strain was best
matched to strains isolated from Lower Juba region of Somalia. There have
been reports of polio from Lower Juba, whose capital is Kismayu.
Kenya has seen a sudden influx of refugees from Somalia due to internal
unrest, and in the last 2 months, over 30 000 refugees have crossed over
into Kenya.
There are 3 refugee camps in Dadaab Division, which are Hagadera, Ifo and
Dagahaley, and they accommodate about 150 000 people. All refugees entering
the camp are immunized against polio as part of the routine, and the camps
also take part in polio campaigns as part of a synchronized polio campaign
in the border regions. The last campaign was held in the last week of
September [2006].
According to the mother of the child, the child had received 4 doses of
polio vaccine, and the child was born in the refugee camp in Kenya in 2002
and had not traveled to Somalia; however, the Medical Authorities are
trying to establish exactly the movements of the child and confirm whether
the child received polio vaccine.
The Ministry of Health is trying to confirm whether this is an imported
case of polio or was acquired in Kenya. If it was acquired in Kenya, it
would be the 1st reported indigenous case in Kenya since 1984.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Sharif for this early report on the
confirmation of a paralytic polio case in Kenya. As mentioned, Kenya has
not had local transmission of wild poliovirus (WPV) since 1984, so the
appearance of a case without a history of direct travel to an area with
known wild poliovirus transmission is disconcerting, although the
possibility that the child had contact with someone who recently traveled
from Somalia is great, as the refugee camps in that region have Somali and
Sudanese refugees with a recent increase in influx of Somali refugees. (For
some background information on these refugee camps, see
<http://www.refugeecamp.org/curriculum/task7/dadaab.htm>.
A recent UN relief web report on the influx of Somali refugees into Kenya
can be seen at
<http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/LZEG-6UJKCG?OpenDocument>).
As of 10 Oct 2006, there have been 31 cases of polio confirmed in Somalia
since January 2006, as compared with 3 cases reported in the same period in
2005. In total since the reintroduction of WPV into Somalia in 2005, there
have been 216 cases of paralytic polio confirmed. The date of onset of the
most recent confirmed case in Somalia was 19 Jul 2006
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>.
All cases in Somalia since 2005 are considered to be import-related (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf>).
Hopefully, the vaccination campaigns conducted in the end of September 2006
will interrupt transmission of the WPV in the refugee camps and prevent
further spread of the virus to other potentially susceptible individuals.

We await further information on the epidemiology of this WPV isolate. -
