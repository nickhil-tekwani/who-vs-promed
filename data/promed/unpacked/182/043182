Two schools in Alicante [province, Valencia] have notified the Department of Public Health at the Department of Health of school outbreaks of whooping cough (pertussis), a contagious disease, which has led to the diagnosis of 16 cases, although the evolution of none of the children affected is serious, as pointed out yesterday [10 Mar 2014] by the Department of Health.

The 1st of the outbreaks was recorded last week [week of 3 Mar 2014]. It has included 13 cases, according to what was reported to Public Health. This week [week of 10 Mar 2014] there is another school where the bacteria have also entered into the classroom, although there are only 3 cases.

Pediatricians pointed out that pertussis can be especially severe in the case of infants under 2 months old, since the 1st dose of the vaccine is not received by that date. They also stressed that Catalonia has decided to begin managing the doses in pregnant women. In January 2014, the Public Health Agency of Catalonia announced that it would begin the systematic vaccination of pregnant women. The recommendation is for pregnant women who are between week 27 and 36 of gestation to get vaccinated, with the goal of improving the protection of the newborn.

[In the USA, "cocooning" of the susceptible neonate has included immunization of close family contacts as well as the pregnant female. Almost all the significant morbidity and mortality of infection with _Bordetella pertussis_ occurs in infants less than 6 months of age.

Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different with periods of apnea sometimes with hypoxia-induced seizures usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000, and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs for mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental oxygen in the hospital and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care. - Mod.LL
