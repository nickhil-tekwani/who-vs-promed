Two cases of rabies in cattle have been confirmed on different farms in the Gillemburg area [Limpopo province] on the border of the Mogalakwena (Waterberg District) and Aganang (Capricorn District) municipalities.

The samples were tested at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute.

According to a release by the provincial Department of Agriculture, in both incidents there was human contact with the carcasses as they were handled by the farm manager and workers. 3 people are currently receiving treatment against rabies at Polokwane and Phafola clinic.

Following the confirmation of the cases, an intensive investigation by officials from the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Social Development ensued, and susceptible livestock in the area were vaccinated by officials and owners. Vaccinations are still being carried out in the affected areas.

It is stated that forward and backward tracing is also being conducted to check if the disease has not spread, and to take the necessary precautionary and preventative measures. Cattle owners in the Gillemburg area are advised to vaccinate the cattle with rabies vaccine immediately. Dogs and cats will also be vaccinated.

Cases in dogs were also noted in Lepelle-Nkumpi and Aganang and vaccinations are continuing. Rabies is a viral disease, which is transmitted from animals to humans/animals through biting by an infected animal. The development of rabies in humans can be prevented if correct post-exposure treatment, including vaccination, is administered timely and correctly. Once humans/animals start showing symptoms of rabies, there is no treatment and the disease [almost always] leads to death.

The public is strongly urged to get their animals vaccinated and to report animals with behavioural changes -- domestic animals getting aggressive and wild animals getting tame -- to their nearest State veterinary office.
