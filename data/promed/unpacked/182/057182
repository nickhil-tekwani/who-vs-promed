Parasite infects cougars
------------------------
Biologists have discovered that some local cougars are carrying a parasitic
intestinal worm that experts say could cause feeding and other behavioral
changes in infected animals, but there's no evidence of such changes. The
worm, named _Cylicospirura felineus_, but commonly called nodular stomach
worm, was found in the small intestines of 6 of the 7 human-killed cougars
checked in the Rogue Valley since January 2004 by state wildlife biologists.
The Rogue Valley and Douglas County, which is the 1st place in Oregon where
the parasites were discovered 2 years ago, are the only places in the state
where biologists have looked for [the parasites].
The worms embed themselves into intestinal walls and create swollen
nodules; of those sampled locally, the nodules ranged in size from as small
as the size of a pencil eraser to as large as a ping-pong ball, Oregon
Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) biologist Mark Vargas said.
The infected local cougars were of various sizes and levels of health, and
all but one had empty stomachs -- indicating they had not eaten in some
time, Vargas said. The only infected cougar with food in its stomach was a
large male killed Friday while feeding on 3 miniature horses it recently
killed in the Applegate Valley. The one uninfected cougar had a full
stomach, signaling what appeared to be a normal feeding pattern on wild
prey, Vargas said. 4 of the infected animals were killed after complaints
of livestock damage in the area, while one was hit by an automobile, Vargas
said. Only 2 were killed by sport-hunters, including the lone uninfected
cougar, he said. "It's new and it's interesting, but what does it mean? I
don't know," Vargas said.
Washington State University parasitology expert Bill Foreyt, who first
wrote about the stomach worms in cougars 15 years ago, said it was "very
feasible and very possible" that the infected cougars' crossing paths with
sport-hunters or attacking livestock may be linked to the parasites' presence.
Cougars are normally very secretive and are rarely seen in Oregon outside
rural or developed areas, and studies show livestock and pets contribute
far less to the diet of cougars in general than wild prey. "Parasites
weaken animals so they don't catch what they normally eat," Foreyt said.
"There's always a correlation between an animal not feeling well and its
behavior, but in which way is something difficult to tell."
But scientists cannot say for certain that the parasite triggers the
infected cougar to eschew wild prey like deer in favor of domesticated
animals. "It would be hard to prove it one way or the other," Foreyt said.
Rick Hopkins, a wildlife ecologist and cougar expert with The Cougar Fund,
based in Montana, said he's "intrigued" with the hypothesis that parasite
infestation could play a role in cougar livestock predation. "I'm willing
to say that, if a cougar becomes weakened and loses the capability to bring
down prey, they'll start looking for prey like livestock," said Hopkins,
who is based in San Jose, Calif. "But we have to get past the idea that
there's one reason cougars prey on livestock," he said. "This may be one
contributing factor."
Hopkins said it would be "quite a stretch" to correlate any risk to humans
from parasite-infected cougars, and that whatever behaviors the infected
animals show would not [be spread to] the species as a whole.
Finding the worms in 6 of 7 cougars was [a high percentage], Foreyt said,
but the sample was far too small to generate any scientific findings. "I
hope (the ODFW) will collect more data to see if there's a correlation or
not," he said. Under state statute, ODFW biologists must examine every
cougar killed during sport-hunting seasons or because of damage complaints,
and the stomachs are occasionally sampled for content, Vargas said.
However, these worms went undetected because the nodules are in the upper
end of the small intestine -- an area not normally sampled, Vargas said.
The worms were first found in Oregon in 2002 during necropsies of 2 cougars
that were part of an ongoing study in Douglas County, said DeWaine Jackson,
the Roseburg-based ODFW biologist running the cougar study. Since then,
biologists have found them in most of the cougars sampled in Douglas
County, but deaths attributed to the parasites should be rare, Jackson
said. "It's not common for an internal parasite to kill its host," Jackson
said. There is little documentation on these parasites in cougars in the
western states, Jackson said. Foreyt said grouse and other birds that
cougars occasionally prey on can be hosts of these worms. Vargas said worms
could be passed between cougars if they share food or water sources or from
contact with each other's feces.
