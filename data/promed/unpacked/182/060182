More than 3330 children treated for dengue fever during 1st 6 months of [2009]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cambodia's dengue fever is a serious problem for children because most
infected cases occurred in children, an official of the Health
Ministry said on Wednesday [1 Jul 2009].

"We have treated 3333 children infected with dengue and another 10
have been killed by [dengue] hemorrhagic fever so far this year
[2009]," said Ngan Chantha, director of the anti-dengue fever
department of the Health Ministry.

"It increased sharply compared with the total cases last year [2008],
when there were only 1811 child cases and 23 children died," he said,
adding that "We have to enhance education and the public campaign on
dengue to raise awareness among our people in rural and urban areas."

The local community has to be careful with children because the rainy
season is starting now. It will be easy for the mosquitoes to lay eggs
in [water catchments]. The tiger mosquito is [a vector for the virus
that causes dengue fever]. [People] have to clean the areas
surrounding their houses, and children [especially] should sleep under
nets, he said.

Duong Socheat, director of the National Malaria Center, which deals
with dengue, was quoted by the Phnom Penh Post as saying that the
worst weeks for dengue fever are in August, and that families need to
learn about the disease and make sure that young children with dengue
are treated by doctors.

Viet Nam's Ministry of Health confirmed 26 deaths out of the country's
27 000 cases of dengue fever in the 1st half of this year [2009],
local newspaper the New Hanoi reported Thursday [2 Jul 2009]. The
number of infected cases represents a 32 percent increase
year-on-year, said the ministry.

The disease mostly occurs in the country's southern provinces such as
Ho Chi Minh City, Kien Giang, Soc Trang, Ben Tre and Dong Nai. The
ministry has dispatched working groups to 15 provinces and
municipalities to inspect the prevention and control work on dengue
fever.

The [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on Thursday [2 Jul
2009] advised travelers to Southeast Asia to take proper precautions
against dengue fever, as a large number of imported cases has been
confirmed in Taiwan so far this year.

"The 90 imported cases of dengue fever reported in Taiwan indicate a
dramatic escalation of the mosquito-borne disease in recent years,"
CDC spokesman Lin Ting said. The number of imported dengue fever cases
would likely reach a peak in August, the CDC said.

The 90 imported cases of dengue fever recorded in Taiwan so far this
year represent a steep rise compared to the same period last year
[2008] when 64 cases were confirmed, the CDC's statistics show.
According to the data, 46 of the cases were contracted in Indonesia,
22 were imported from Viet Nam, 6 from Thailand, 5 from Cambodia, 4
from the Philippines and 2 each from Myanmar and Singapore [=87;
presumably the origin of 3 cases was not determined. - Mod.JW]

[There has been local transmission of dengue viruses in Taiwan in the
past. These imported cases represent a real threat of initiating a
dengue outbreak there again.

The level of involvement of communities in 'gotong-royong' (self-help)
activities for combating and controlling dengue fever is still low, as
only 28 activities were held throughout the country compared to the 69
called for the 1st 25 weeks of the year [2009].

Health Director-General Tan Sri Dr Mohd Ismail Marican said in the
period of 21-27 Jun 2009 vector control activity could also not be
implemented wholly as only 320 845 houses were fogged compared to the
682 648 houses identified. Besides that 731 compound notices [fines
for _Aedes_ mosquito breeding sites on the premises] amounting to RM36
870 [USD 10 455] and 256 clean-up notices were issued in the week to
house dwellers found to be breeding the _Aedes_ mosquito.

In the same period, there were 749 dengue fever cases with one death
each in Kuala Lumpur and Kelantan compared to 738 cases the week
before, he said in a statement here Friday [3 Jul 2009]. "The 5 states
that showed sharp rises in dengue cases were Perlis (57 percent),
Melaka (36 percent), Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya (34 percent), Penang
(30 percent) and Kedah (15 percent)," he said.

According to him, the total number of dengue cases was 24 534 cases
with 62 deaths compared to 20 721 cases with 45 deaths in the same
period last year [2008].

Dengue has claimed its 11th victim in this city this year with the
death of a 3-year-old child on 1 Jul [2009], a day after she was
brought to the Cebu City Medical Center (CCMC). The child was the 3rd
victim to die of dengue fever in Barangay Labangon this year [2009].
Her death came 12 days after a 4-year-old boy from Barangay Talamban
succumbed to dengue last month [June 2009]. A 10-year-old girl from
Sikatuna St. died of dengue on 9 May 2009. She was the 9th dengue
fatality in the city this year.

Macasocol said that City Hall offers free complete blood counts and
platelet counts to possible cases of dengue, so there should have been
no reason for residents not to bring the sick to the CCMC or to the
barangay health centers for consultation.

City Health Department records showed that 381 persons have contracted
dengue fever in Cebu City from 1 Jan - 20 Jun 2009. That figure is
41.65 percent lower compared to the 653 [dengue] cases recorded during
the same period last year [2008]. While 11 lives were lost this year,
the number is 62 percent lower compared to 29 deaths due to dengue
last year.

Assistant City Epidemiologist Durinda Macasocol said awareness of
dengue and proper sanitation are necessary to combat the disease. That
is why, she said, the CHD and the 80 barangay captains of the city
have agreed to make every 1st Saturday of the month a "cleaning day,"
when residents should "seek and destroy" mosquito breeding sites.

While swine flu has become the focus of public health, the main
hospital in American Samoa, along with the health department, has
issued a reminder to residents that dengue fever also remains a
problem in the territory.

The Health Department's medical director Dr. Ivan Tuliau said the
public must remember that dengue is still an issue in the territory
and urged communities to continue their efforts to eradicate breeding
grounds for mosquitoes. However, the good news is that the number of
dengue cases continues to decrease.

In January [2009] there were 80, and 85 in February. For the month of
April 2009 only 33 people have been confirmed to have dengue fever.

The recorded [number] of dengue cases in the state has increased
around 2000 per week, showing that the situation is still worrying,
warned the state Secretariat of Health (SES) through the
epidemiological bulletin issued yesterday [28 Jun 2009], which also
revealed 36 deaths due to the disease. The warning is that the
municipalities continue with the monitoring and implementation of
actions required by the state dengue contingency plan.

So far, the SES records show 29 977 cases of classical dengue fever
reported -- last week there were 27 153, or 2824 fewer cases of the
disease. Of the total identified yesterday 1152 are of serious cases
of dengue. The State recorded to date 36 notified deaths of cases of
serious [dengue] illness. Of these deaths reported, 22 of them were
confirmed as severe cases and 14 of these are under investigation.
These numbers are from the Coordinating [Unit] of the Epidemiological
Monitoring of SES-MT. In Cuiaba, the data report the notification of
13 deaths. Of these, 8 were confirmed as severe cases of dengue and 5
are still under investigation. Currently in the city of Varzea
Grande, up to now the [number of] recorded deaths is 7. Of that total,
6 of them were confirmed [dengue cases] and one case is still under
investigation.

According to the SES, this year [2009] the State reported an increase
in dengue [cases] of 196 percent. In January - June 2008, the recorded
[number] of dengue cases was 10 111. Already in 2009, during same
period, 29 977 cases of the disease have been reported.

The information is that Mato Grosso continues to be on alert for the
epidemic of severe cases of dengue and also for the increase in
reported cases of classical dengue fever. The contingency plan should
be maintained and implemented by 141 municipalities, in addition to
[creating] awareness on the part of the population, which is not doing
its part [to control the disease].
