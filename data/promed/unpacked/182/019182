[1] Sierra Leone: 4th doctor dies

Sierra Leone has lost a 4th doctor to EVD after a failed effort to transfer her abroad for medical treatment, a government official said Sun [14 Sep 2014], a huge setback to the impoverished country that is battling the virulent disease amid a shortage of health care workers. Dr. Olivet Buck died late Sat [13 Sep 2014], hours after the World Health Organization said it could not help medically evacuate her to Germany, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Brima Kargbo confirmed to The Associated Press. Sierra Leone had requested funds from WHO to transport Buck to Europe, saying the country could not afford to lose another doctor.

WHO had said that it could not meet the request but instead would work to give Buck "the best care possible" in Sierra Leone, including possible access to experimental drugs. EVD is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of sick patients, making doctors and nurses especially vulnerable to contracting the virus that has no vaccine or [specific] treatment. More than 300 health workers have become infected with EVD in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Nearly half of them have died, according to WHO.

[It rather looks as though it was already too late by the time the request was made. The difference between WHO's response to this case and to that of the Senegalese doctor who was evacuated to Germany is probably due to the latter having been employed by WHO and covered by WHO health insurance, which pays for air evacuation and hospitalization.

Synopsis: Added: 3 Sep 2014 2:13 pm

This requirement is in response to the Department of State's diplomatic mission overseas to provide movement of emergency response personnel into and out of hazardous/non-permissive environments and medical evacuation of critically ill/injured patients, including those infected with unique and highly contagious pathogens. This is an immediate response to the Ebola virus crisis.

[This USD 4.9 million dollar contract covers 3 evacuations per month for 6 months. According to details in the Sole Source (Rush) Justification (which is well worth reading), the 2 jets available were equipped with biosafety level 4 isolation units under a CDC contract years ago and mothballed in 2011 when the CDC could no longer afford to keep them on standby. But they are not permitted to over-fly or land in most [mainland] European Union countries or refuel there and are only authorized to refuel at a US base in the Azores islands (which belong to Portugal, in the Atlantic Ocean, 900 miles west of it and 2000 miles east of the USA) and, therefore, can only be used to evacuate people to military bases in the USA.

Mexico, Japan, UK, Canada, UAE, UN and WHO had already tried to get exclusive contracts with the provider. However, an EVD-infected British nurse was evacuated from Sierra Leone in a similarly equipped Royal Air Force jet to a military air base in the UK and transferred to an isolation suite in a UK hospital. He recovered. See ProMED-mail post "Ebola virus disease - West Africa (152): region, UN, Nigeria, tests 20140906.2753389." - Mod.JW]

[3] Infection control is not working
Date: 14 Sep 2014
From: Bjorg Marit Andersen <bomarand@hotmail.com> [edited]


Infection control concerning EVD is not working, especially when more than 240 [now 300] healthcare personnel have been infected, and more than 120 workers have died. Guidelines used to control SARS in 2003 should be used, not "contact and droplet protection of 1-2 meters," as is still recommended by WHO.

Personal protective equipment (PPE) for contact and airborne infections should be used because of
a) respiratory symptoms,
b) a big distance -- up to 9 meters -- for droplets when coughing and sneezing (Bourouiba et al. J Fluid Mechanics 2014;745:537-563.),
c) re-aerolization from the environment, bed clothes etc.,
d) long survival of the virus outside the body, and
e) high lethality.

Healthcare workers (HCW) and helpers should be protected with PPE as they were during the SARS epidemic. The SARS epidemic was an infection control success by the healthcare system of some countries in Asia in 2003. But WHO should not repeat the same failure as was done during the early phase of the SARS-epidemic by using "contact and droplet isolation." Separate hospitals for EVD should be built, like in China (1000 beds in 8 days for SARS), and only patients with laboratory documented EVD should be cohorted. Suspected cases should be isolated separately.

HCW and helpers should be trained and especially observed concerning [putting] PPE on and taking [it] off. The observers should also use PPE. During the SARS epidemic, HCW were re-contaminated by not knowing how to take off PPE.

Exposed people and patients with other diseases should be treated in professional triages to reduce the population's fear of being EVD-infected during contact with healthcare. Exposed people should be taken care of by professional helpers.

There is a need for a lot of resources, especially concerning infection control work.

[The above directions are perfectly correct. Unfortunately, investigators are concluding that health worker infections are occurring outside the hospitals. - Mod.JW]

[4] Suspected cases & false alarms

13 Sep 2014: From Bernice Staub <bernice.staub@vtxfree.ch>
Re: Nigeria: false alarm [Ebola virus disease - West Africa (162): WHO, volunteering, protection Archive No. 20140912.2770539]
------------------------
ProMED commented: "There have been no reports of EVD in Morocco, so quarantine was an unnecessary over-reaction."
But as Air Morocco is the only airline flying a regular schedule to the affected countries, it is reasonable. There were statements that she worked before in Guinea and Sierra Leone, so she might have used Casablanca as a hub to get out of the region.

[That is a possibility. Perhaps her passport showed she had recently been in those countries, in which case it was a reasonable precaution. - Mod.JW]

Ghana: suspected case
---------------------
14 Sep 2014: (Ghanaweb) Health workers at the Achimota Hospital in Accra [capital of Ghana] have reportedly abandoned the facility over a suspected EVD case Sun [14 Sep 2014]. A patient was rushed to the hospital Sunday morning showing symptoms of the deadly disease that is sweeping West Africa. Other patients at the hospital have been left to their fate, local station Citi FM is reporting. StarrFMOnline.com understands that the suspected EVD patient is a Nigerian and is battling severe fever. According to the Head of Disease Surveillance at the Ghana Health Service, Dr Badu Sakordie, the case is being investigated.

China: false alarm
-----------------
11 Sep 2014: (Roll Sohu) A case of malaria was reported in a Wuhan patient who had returned from a tour in Africa (Niger, not Nigeria), in mid-August [2014]. He was fearful that he might have contracted EVD and would be placed in isolation. He withheld his travel history for 5 days while being treated for cold/flu. After revealing that he was in Africa, he was tested and found to have malaria.

[There are no reports of EVD in Niger. This kind of suppression of travel history may be occurring frequently and could lead to large numbers of contacts by a real case. - Mod.JW]

Italy: Suspected EVD case in Italy suffers from malaria.
---------------------------------
9 Sep 2014: (Xinhua) A Nigerian woman hospitalised on Tue [9 Sep 2014] in Italy with suspected symptoms of EVD was suffering from malaria, hospital authorities said. The results did not yet rule out a possible EVD infection...
