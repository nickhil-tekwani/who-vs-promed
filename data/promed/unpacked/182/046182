During the summer of 2020, the State Serum Institut (SSI) analyzed a high number of samples for contagious equine metritis (CEM) in connection with a large outbreak of this disease in Icelandic horses. The outbreak is one of the largest outbreaks of CEM in Europe in the last 10 years.

At the end of June [2020], the 1st samples from Icelandic horses were submitted for CEM study. After several stallions were found positive for CEM, additional samples were taken from animals where infection was suspected, as well as from animals with and without signs of disease. From late June to late August [2020], SSI tested more than 700 samples from a total of 269 horses. _Taylorella equigenitalis_ was detected in 14 stallions and approximately 90 mares.

The number of submitted samples and positive findings was at its highest in mid-July [2020]. Most horses that were found positive for _T. equigenitalis_ are currently treated and followed up with negative control tests.

There is currently no information that can indicate how and when the disease entered Denmark and how it has spread in the population of Icelandic horses in Denmark. The outbreak has had practical and economic consequences for horse owners and horse breeders.

About the disease CEM
---------------------
Contagious equine metritis (CEM) is caused by the bacterium _Taylorella equigenitalis_, which causes contagious inflammation of the uterus in mares. The bacterium is transmitted by mating, insemination or indirect contact. The mares may show signs of genital infection and reproductive problems, including abortion, but some mares show no signs of infection. The mares can transmit the bacterium to stallions. The stallions usually become healthy carriers. CEM is a disease that is only transmitted between horses and not to humans. The disease is found in several countries in Europe, but is very rare in Denmark. In Denmark, CEM was detected twice in 2019, and before that, last time in 2009. CEM is a notifiable disease in Denmark, and SSI is the reference laboratory for the disease. All positive findings are reported to the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration.

Diagnosis of CEM
----------------
_T. equigenitalis_ can be detected by PCR or culture. Culture is not used routinely on SSI as the method is time consuming and has low sensitivity. PCR, which detects bacterial DNA, is a faster and more sensitive method and is therefore SSI's standard method. The analysis is performed on swab samples from the horse's genitals (3-4 samples per animal).

[Contagious Equine Metritis is an OIE-listed animal disease; exhaustive information, including diagnostic techniques, is available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.05.02_CEM.pdf.

Venereal contact during natural mating presents the highest risk for the transmission of _T. equigenitalis_ from a contaminated stallion or an infected mare. Direct venereal transmission can also take place by artificial insemination using infective raw, chilled and possibly frozen semen. Indirectly, infection may be acquired through fomite transmission, manual contamination, inadequate observance of appropriate biosecurity measures at the time of breeding and at semen collection centres. Stallions can become asymptomatic carriers of _T. equigenitalis_. The principal sites of colonisation by the bacterium are the urogenital membranes (urethral fossa, urethral sinus, terminal urethra and penile sheath). The sites of persistence of _T. equigenitalis_ in the majority of carrier mares are the clitoral sinuses and fossa and infrequently the uterus. Foals born of carrier mares may also become carriers. The organism can infect equid species other than horses, e.g. donkeys.

The current ("recurrent") CEM event in Denmark, which started on 24 Jun 2020, has been reported to the OIE in an 'Immediate notification' (20200705.7542470) and in 2 follow-up reports. So far, 9 outbreaks, spread throughout the country, have been reported (summary, map, and links to the 2 follow-up reports at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=34932).

The most recent follow-up report (No 2, dated 31 Aug 2020), informed the resolvement of an outbreak which had started 9 Jul 2020, with the following details: "Stallion used for breeding, no clinical signs observed. Samples were collected on 9 Jul 2020, and _Taylorella equigenitalis_ was detected on 30 Jul 2020. Official restrictions were imposed on the stallion on 30 Jul 2020. The stallion was subsequently subject for antimicrobial treatment. On 4 Aug 2020, the restrictions were lifted after the stallion tested negative for _T. equigenitalis_."

A previous CEM event, which was restricted to a single case, affected Denmark in December 2019; its OIE summary and map can be seen at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=32688. That event was declared resolved on 20 Feb 2020.

The Icelandic horse breed is represented by associations in 19 countries, with the International Federation of Icelandic Horse Associations (FEIF) serving as a governing international parent organization. The next world's Championships of Icelandic horses is scheduled in Herning, Denmark, in August 2021 (see VM-2021 at https://vmdenmark.com/). - Mod.AS
