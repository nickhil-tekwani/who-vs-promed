[1] Canada (Alberta): steak-related cases
Date: Wed 26 Sep 2012

Health officials say they have confirmed the steaks that made 4 people sick in Edmonton originated from an XL Foods plant and were sold at a Costco store in the northeast part of the city. CFIA is recalling beef steaks sold at the northeast Edmonton Costco under the Kirland brand. The steaks were sold at the Costco store on 50th Street and 136th Avenue under the Kirkland brand and were contaminated with _E. coli_ [O157].

Alberta Health Services (AHS) linked the striploin grilling steaks with 4 cases of illness announced last week [week of 17 Sep 2012]. "We know the food source. What we don't know at this point is the source of the contamination," said Dr Gerry Predy, Alberta's senior medical health officer. He said health officials were able to link the illness to the store after testing a steak provided by one of people who became sick.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has issued a health alert over the meat but it is still unclear how and where the meat became contaminated. The steaks were sold between 4 and 7 Sep 2012, and are marked with one of the following "Packed On" dates: 12 / SE / 04, 12 / SE / 05, 12 / SE / 06, and 12 / SE / 07.
Consumers are urged to check meat they have in their freezers to see if it is covered by the alert.

Predy said during their investigation, it was discovered that Costco stores across the province used a tenderization process that may have played a role in the _E. coli_ illnesses. The stores would run steaks through a machine that would strike them with a meat tenderizer with a needle-like surface. Predy says if _E. coli_ bacteria were on the surface of the meat, the process may have forced it deeper into the steak, where it would be more difficult to kill while cooking.

"Our public health message has been that if you're eating steak, it's OK to eat it rare," said Predy. "If this process is going to be used, then the public needs to know it has been used so the public can use necessary precautions." He said the process doesn't violate health codes, but AHS has asked stores in the province to stop using the machines as a precaution.

The steaks came from the XL Foods processing plant near Brooks in southern Alberta, said Canadian Food Inspection Agency spokesperson Tim O'Connor. That's the same facility where 250 ground beef products have been recalled from stores across the country.

No direct link between _E. coli_ illnesses and the plant has been established, said O'Connor. "There are many steps in-between and, while it is possible, we cannot say conclusively at this time that that [facility] is the source of contamination," he said.

In a statement, XL Foods said it is co-operating with the CFIA and AHS in their investigations. The company said a recent review of its operation found 2 "deficiencies" that could have played a part in the contamination. It says it has since changed those procedures.

Source: EIN News/Marketwire, Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) report [edited]

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) priority is maintaining the safety of the food supply. CFIA actions were and continue to be guided by science-based evidence and a commitment to protect public health. To this end, the CFIA has taken and is continuing to take comprehensive action to respond to the _E. coli_ issue.

The Agency's response started on 4 Sep 2012 when it first detected _E. coli_ O157:H7 in products produced from an Alberta facility supplied by XL Foods Inc. That same day, the CFIA was notified by the United States Department of Agriculture of a positive _E. coli_ O157:H7 sample in beef trimmings from XL Foods Inc. The CFIA quickly verified that no affected product was in the marketplace and immediately launched an investigation of XL Foods Inc. to determine the source of the contamination.

This led to some products produced on 24, 27, 28, and 29 Aug 2012 and 5 Sep 2012 being recalled to protect Canadian consumers. While the CFIA's investigation did not identify one single factor that would lead to _E. coli_ O157:H7 contamination, the combination of several deficiencies played a role. By themselves, each of these findings would not typically signal an immediate concern during the course of normal inspection activities.

The detection of _E. coli_ in slaughter facilities is not uncommon, and plants are expected to have adequate measures in place to monitor higher than normal detection rates and modify control measures accordingly. This trend analysis was not always conducted consistently at the facility.

In addition, CFIA noted deviations were noted from the company's documented _E. coli_ O157:H7 control measures and sampling and testing procedures. The company was unable to demonstrate through its documentation that it was consistently and effectively implementing its agreed-upon control program.

During this period, the CFIA enhanced its onsite inspection activities, including additional oversight of testing for _E. coli_.

The company took initial steps to ensure the safety of food being produced and at the time committed to additional steps to deal with all issues and prevent recurrence. However, based on information provided by XL Foods, Inc. on 26 Sep 2012, as well as through CFIA inspector oversight, the CFIA has determined that these deficiencies have not been completely corrected. To date, the company has not adequately implemented agreed-upon corrective actions and has not presented acceptable plans to address longer-term issues.

Therefore, effective immediately, the CFIA has temporarily suspended the licence to operate Establishment 38 - XL Foods, Inc. All products currently at this plant are under CFIA detention and control. These products will only be released after being tested for _E. coli_ O157:H7. The company has also expanded its voluntary recall of raw meat produced on 24, 27, 28, and 29 Aug 2012 and 5 Sep 2012. The CFIA will continue to immediately alert consumers as additional products are identified. This will lead to a series of recall announcements over the next few days as implicated products are identified and traced.

XL Foods Inc. will not resume operations until they have demonstrated that they have fully implemented CFIA's required corrective actions.

CFIA actions will continue to be guided by science-based evidence and a commitment to protect consumers

Food Safety News reported yesterday, 27 Sep 2012, that the enormous _E. coli_ contaminated Canadian beef recall that began earlier in September 2012 has been expanded 7 times, and includes 890 000 pounds of boxed ground beef and manufacturing trim that has been imported to the USA. According to the US Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), the contaminated beef was sent to 12 US meat processors and impacts multiple retailers in 30 states.

The FSIS stated Wed 26 Sep 2012, that it hadn't been determined exactly how much of the beef had been imported from XL Foods, the Canadian source before the agency began stopping the beef's entry at the US/Canadian border. A sampling of the beef on 30 Aug 2012 showed the presence of _E. coli_ O157:H7 after routine microbiological testing. Both consumer advocates and the media are questioning whether authorities have moved quickly enough on this slow moving recall to adequately protect public health. CBS News reported on Wed 26 Sep 2012, that the Canadian Food Inspection Agency didn't begin their inspection of XL Foods, Canada's largest meat processor, until 10 days after the contamination was originally reported. The CFIA initiated the beef recall on 16 Sep 2012.

The FSIS had listed all Albertson's Markets in Oregon and Washington State, as well as 3 Idaho locations, FoodsCo Markets in California, Safeway Markets in Oregon and Washington State, and Food4Less, Jay C Kroger, and Safeway locations in the greater Cincinnati area, Northern Kentucky, Dayton, Ohio, and Indiana. However, according to eFoodAlert, Haggen Northwest Fresh in Washington and Oregon, and TOP Food & Drug, also in Washington and Oregon, should be on the FSIS's impact list. As of last night [27 Sep 2012], Walmart and others have been added.

***Go to the FSIS website at http://www.fsis.usda.gov/ for a list of updated information including impacted states, retailers, and recalled beef products.

Food & Water Watch, a Washington DC advocacy group, has criticized the FSIS for it's slow response. Wenonah Hauter, Food & Water Watch executive director said, "After knowing for 17 days that they had a potential public health crisis on their hands, the management of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service finally issued a 'Public Health Alert' at 9:00 pm on 20 Sep 2012 regarding tainted beef that had crossed the border from Canada. Where's the recall?" The FSIS says that it took swift action in response to finding _E. coli_ 0157:H7 at the border.

There are no known USA illnesses reported to date.

[Non-ground beef items themselves, in the form of steaks or roasts, are uncommon reservoirs for EHEC because the contamination is on the surface cut, not internal. Even if the meat is prepared rare, the bacteria on the surface should be killed by the heat. Several ProMED-mail posts, however, have reported transmission of EHEC from rare steaks, almost all clearly were related to injection of the meat with tenderizer or seasonings or mechanical tenderization with needles meant to heighten the culinary experience. The procedures can physically carry surface bacteria into the meat where the bacteria may not be killed as easily. - Mod.LL]
