Abstract
--------
A novel Hendra virus (HeV) variant was identified through multidisciplinary and interagency syndromic surveillance of a horse having suffered acute fatal disease consistent with HeV infection. Novel molecular assays for HeV detection are described in the light of routine testing failure. In silico analysis of the variant receptor-binding protein in comparison with prototypic HeV supported that the monoclonal antibody m102.4 used for post-exposure prophylaxis, as well as the equine vaccine, should be effective also against this novel variant. Similarity of this virus (99%) to a partial sequence detected from a South Australian grey-headed flying fox, along with case exposure to this species in Queensland, suggests the variant circulates at least across the range of this flying fox species. Investigation into HeV diversity, comparative kinetics and pathogenicity, reservoir-species associations, viral-host co-evolution, and spillover dynamics should be prioritized. Biosecurity practices should be updated to appreciate HeV spillover risk across all regions frequented by flying foxes regardless of species.

[The implications of this are currently unclear. It does indicate there are apparently different strains of this virus, and perhaps different viral strains may be carried by certain types of bats. The researchers also indicated that that the equine vaccine should protect against this strain. - Mod.TG
