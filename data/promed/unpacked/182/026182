A marked increase in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) has been
observed in the Republic of Tatarstan. Since the beginning of the year
[2009], 2 people have died as a result of HFRS infection in Naberezhnye
Chelny and the Almetyevsky district of the republic. The incidence of HFRS
has increased 14-fold in comparison with the same period of last year [2008].

During the 1st 3 months of 2008, there were 32 HFRS cases, whereas during
the same period this year [2009], a total of 436 cases of HFRS have been
recorded. Humans contract infection while taking recreation in woodlands
and working at small holdings.

According to Rospotrebnadzor [the Federal Health and Welfare Authority], a
significant increase in HFRS incidence was observed in 2008. A 3.5-fold
increase was recorded, and there were 9 deaths. Specialists associate the
current situation with a significant growth in the rodent vector population
as a consequence of warmer summer weather and a prolonged autumn.
