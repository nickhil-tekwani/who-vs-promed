Ebola situation report -- Data up to 8 Mar 2015
--------------------------------
Summary
-------
A total of 116 new confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in the week to 8 Mar 2015, compared with 132 the previous week. Liberia reported no new confirmed cases for the 2nd consecutive week. New cases in Guinea and Sierra Leone occurred in a geographically contiguous arc around the coastal capital cities of Conakry and Freetown, with a total of 11 districts reporting cases. Although there has been no significant decline in overall case incidence since late January 2015, the recent contraction in the geographical distribution of cases is a positive development, enabling response efforts to be focused on a smaller area.

Guinea reported 58 new confirmed cases in the week to 8 Mar 2015, compared with 51 cases the previous week. Cases were clustered in an area around and including the capital Conakry (13 cases), with the nearby prefectures of Boffa (2 cases), Coyah (8 cases), Dubreka (5 cases), Forecariah (28 cases), and Kindia (2 cases) the only other prefectures to report cases.

Sierra Leone reported 58 new confirmed cases in the week to 8 Mar 2015; the 1st time since June 2014 that weekly incidence has not exceeded that of Guinea. Cases were reported from 5 northern and western districts clustered around the capital Freetown, which reported 27 new confirmed cases. The neighbouring districts of Bombali (6 cases), Kambia (7 cases), Port Loko (12 cases) and Western Rural (6 cases) also reported cases.

In the 4 days to 5 Mar 2015, there were 90 reported suspected cases in Liberia, none of whom tested positive for EVD, indicating that vigilance is being maintained. A total of 102 contacts were being followed up.

The number of confirmed EVD deaths occurring in the community has risen for the past 3 weeks in Guinea, suggesting that there are still significant challenges in terms of contact tracing and community engagement. Of a total of 40 EVD-positive deaths reported in the week to 8 Mar 2015, 24 occurred in the community. By contrast, a far smaller proportion of EVD-positive deaths occurred in the community in Sierra Leone: 11 of 83. A total of 13 unsafe burials were reported from Guinea and 2 from Sierra Leone over the same period.

In the week to 1 Mar 2015, 7 of 51 (14 per cent) confirmed cases of EVD reported from Guinea arose among known contacts of previous cases, indicating that there are a large number of untraced contacts associated with known chains of transmission and that unknown chains of transmission persist. In Sierra Leone, by contrast, 52 of 81 (64 percent) of confirmed EVD cases arose among known contacts over the same period. The average daily number of contacts traced in the week to 8 Mar 2015 was 1433 in Guinea, compared with 7934 in Sierra Leone.

The relatively low proportion of cases arising among known contacts, the relatively high proportion of EVD-positive deaths that occur in the community, and the continued occurrence of unsafe burials in Guinea are all indicative of continued difficulties engaging effectively with affected communities. A total of 7 Guinean prefectures reported at least one security incident in the week to 8 Mar 2015.

During the week to 1 Mar 2015, 5 cross-border meetings took place, including a coordination meeting in Kambia and Forecariah to facilitate communication, share best practices, and align strategies.

In the week to 8 Mar 2015, one new health worker infection was reported in Guinea, bringing the total number of health worker infections reported across the 3 most-affected countries since the start of the outbreak to 840, with 491 deaths.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
-----------------------------------
There have been over 24 000 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (table 1), with almost 10 000 reported deaths (outcomes for many cases are unknown). A total of 58 new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea, 0 in Liberia, and 58 in Sierra Leone in the 7 days to 8 Mar 2015 (4 days to 5 Mar 2015 for Liberia).

The total number of confirmed and probable cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), people aged 15 to 44 are approximately 3 times more likely to be affected. People aged 45 and over are nearly 4 times more likely to be affected than children.

A total of 840 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in the 3 intense-transmission countries; there have been 491 reported deaths (table 4).

[3] WHO independent panel
Date: Wed 11 Mar 2015
Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/who-director-general-chan-appoints-ebola-panel-33222/


The WHO Director-General has commissioned a panel of outside independent experts to undertake an assessment on all aspects of WHO's response in the Ebola outbreak. This is in response to a resolution passed during the Ebola Special Session of the Executive Board in January 2015.

As CBC News reports, The Geneva-based United Nations health agency was sharply criticized for failing to heed repeated warnings by the medical charity Medcins Sans Frontieres in the early days of the epidemic, which quickly grew to become the largest in history.

Dame Barbara Stocking will chair the panel. She was formerly Chief Executive of Oxfam GB (2001-13) and during this time led major humanitarian responses. Currently, she is President of Murray Edwards College, University of Cambridge, UK.

The other panel members are: Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfun, Director-General of the National Institute for Biomedical Research, Democratic Republic of the Congo; Dr Faisal Shuaib, Head of the National Ebola Emergency Operations Center, Nigeria; Dr Carmencita Alberto-Banatin, independent consultant and advisor on health emergencies and disasters, Philippines; Professor Julio Frenk, Dean of the Faculty, Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; and Professor Ilona Kickbusch, Director of the Global Health Programme at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva, Switzerland.

The panel will present a 1st progress report on its work to the 68th World Health Assembly in May 2015.

The latest Ebola case count from the 3 countries with widespread and intense transmission shows that there have been over 23 900 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with over 9800 reported deaths (outcomes for many cases are unknown). A total of 51 new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea, 0 in Liberia, and 81 in Sierra Leone in the 7 days to 1 Mar [2015].

[4] Measles immunization
Date: Mon 9 Mar 2015
Source: UNICEF [edited]
http://www.unicef.org/media/media_78416.ht


UNICEF is helping governments and communities restart stalled immunizations amid a surge in measles cases in Ebola-affected countries, where health systems are overwhelmed and tens of thousands of children are left vulnerable to deadly diseases. "Measles is a major killer of children that can easily be stopped through a safe and effective vaccine," said Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF Regional Director for West and Central Africa. "But immunization rates have dropped significantly, further threatening children's lives."

The increase in cases of measles -- a highly contagious disease -- is of particular concern as a drop in immunization coverage rates has left children vulnerable at a time when measles transmission traditionally peaks in West Africa, between December and March. Health systems are overstretched by efforts to manage the Ebola crisis, and people are avoiding health facilities for fear of contracting Ebola. As a result, preliminary figures clearly show that vaccine coverage rates have fallen sharply tin 2015.

In Liberia, for example, government data show that monthly measles immunization coverage against target dropped from 71 per cent in May 2014, to 55 per cent in October [2014], with only about 50 per cent of health facilities reporting. While vaccination campaigns that involve large crowds have been put on hold, UNICEF and partners are intensifying carefully guided routine immunizations to rapidly reduce the number of unimmunized children.

As vaccinators venture out to provide lifesaving vaccines, which in many cases are long overdue, they also help with the control of the Ebola outbreak. In compliance with infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures and WHO guidelines on immunization in the context of an Ebola outbreak, UNICEF is providing not only vaccines but also kits that include gloves and infrared thermometers for vaccinators. Vaccinators are being trained on infection prevention and control measures, supervision during immunization activities, and on how to conduct outreach sessions in areas which have not reported an Ebola case for 42 days. Breaking the cycle of Ebola transmission and improving health services, including vaccinations, must go hand in hand in order to defeat the virus and to prevent large-scale child deaths.

UNICEF is playing a major role in the response, promoting behaviour that can help stop transmission, setting up Community Care Centres -- where patients can be supported by their families and communities, with a referral system for any complicated cases -- and providing essential supplies. It is also helping train community health workers, providing psychosocial support to Ebola-affected children and ensuring access to the clean water and waste management systems that are essential to preventing new infections. "The best way we can help children is by stopping Ebola, while at the same time strengthening health systems," said Fontaine. "We need to restore faith in the health system and offer communities regular opportunities for their children to get the vaccines they need to stay healthy. Vaccinators and other health workers who are in the frontline need to feel protected so they can deliver life-saving interventions in the context of Ebola," Fontaine added. ...

[Measles, a virus that attacks the respiratory tract, is one of the most contagious diseases known. Children are especially vulnerable for deadly infections; 330 children die from measles every day, despite the availability of a safe, effective and affordable vaccine. Measles survivors are often left with life-long disabilities, such as blindness, deafness or brain damage.

The success of measles vaccination has been dramatic. Since 2000, an estimated 15.6 million child deaths have been prevented through measles immunization. In 2013, approximately 84 percent of children around the world were immunized against measles. UNICEF, with international and governmental support, is helping to improve coverage for routine measles immunization and conducting regular campaigns in the high-risk regions of Africa and Asia. See http://www.unicef.org/immunization/index_measles.html.

UNCEF is to be lauded for its efforts. - Mod.LK]
