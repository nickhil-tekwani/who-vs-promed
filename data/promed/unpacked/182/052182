Bolivia: Cases of sylvatic yellow fever are still occurring, bringing the
total number of confirmed cases for 1999 to 53 with 21 deaths (case
fatality rate of 39.6%). All of the cases have occurred in the Department
of Santa Cruz. A majority of the cases have been in males (75.5%) and in
persons >15 years of age (76.9%). No cases in children <1 year have been
reported. Mass yellow fever vaccination campaigns have occurred in the two
municipalities that have been most affected- Cabezas and Postrervalle-
achieving coverage rates of 93% and 97% respectively. The last case
identified occurred on 15 April 1999. The goal of the Ministry of Health is
to vaccinate 100% of the population in the endemic yellow fever zones this
year.
Brazil: For 1999, the total number of confirmed sylvatic yellow fever cases
has reached 18, with 3 deaths (case fatality rate of 16.7%). Fifty percent
of the cases have been in persons >15 years old, 44.4% have been in
children ages 1-15 years and 5.6% (representing one case) have been in
children <1 year of age. Most of the cases have occurred in males (72.2%).
The outbreak seems to be concentrated in two municipalities- Afua and
Breves, in the State of Para. Reports from Brazil show that many of the
cases from Afua were identified through active surveillance and serological
surveys after a death due to yellow fever occurred in February 1999.
Although a vaccination campaign was carried out in Afua achieving 100%
coverage, cases continue to occur due to the migration of unimmunized
people into the area. Families are migrating to this area for work,
primarily harvesting heart of palm. In the process of harvesting the trees,
the habitat of the mosquitoes is disrupted and contact with humans,
including unimmunized young children, occurs.
Colombia: To date in 1999, the total number of confirmed sylvatic cases is
two and both cases were fatal. These two cases were in males, ages 17 and
21 years. The cases occurred in the Departments of Caqueta and Meta. No
cases have been reported since January.
Peru: The first confirmed case of sylvatic yellow fever for 1999 was
reported in a 25 year old male from the department of Loreto, Amazon region
who died on 7 April. In response to this case, mass yellow fever
vaccination was initiated in the area. Other cases have occurred in San
Martin Department, in the districts of Moyobamba, Jepelacio and Alonso de
Alvarado (26 cases), Ayacucho Department in the province of La Mar,
district of Anco y Santa Rosa (12 cases), Huanuco Department (5 cases) and
Junin Department (5 cases). Of these a total of 13 cases have been
confirmed to date.

[It is not only in the areas where the cases are occurring that mass
vaccination should be carried out. Major cities in the region are infested
by the yellow fever mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ , as shown by the occurrence
of dengue in those cities (transmitted by the same mosquito). Mass
vaccination should also be carried out in them, to reduce the risk of urban
YF epidemics triggered by a case from the rural area coming to a hospital
in the city & infecting mosquitoes there. This is not a theoretical risk;
large outbreaks have occurred in major Nigerian cities in recent years for
the same reason, see:
Yellow fever - Nigeria 941216
& WHO reports for 1993 [before ProMED-mail began
Yellow fever mistaken for dengue 961113201305
Yellow fever mistaken for dengue: implications 961110145905
I know Belem (Para) & Manaus (Amazonas), Brazil have been vaccinated but I
do not have figures for current coverage. There is also a remote danger
that a person sick with yellow fever could be flown to Rio de Janeiro or
Sao Paulo, Brazil, and infect the
mosquitoes in those places. The same goes for major cities in the other S.
American countries in this report. - Mod.JW
