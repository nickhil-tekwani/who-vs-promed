The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is warning people in London, [Ontario,
about 200 kilometres [124 mi] south west of Toronto], not to eat a certain
ground beef product after 3 children in the area have become ill with an
_Escherichia coli_ infection. Over the last 5 days, the Middlesex-London
Health Unit has received reports of 3 children with _E. coli_ O157:H7
infection, the agency said in a news release on Sunday [28 Jun 2009].

The federal health agency said that to have 3 confirmed cases over "such a
short time frame is unusual". In 2 of the cases, the common food consumed
was a spiced ground beef product called kofta purchased on [14 and 15 Jun
2009] from the Westmount Halal Food Store in London.

The agency said the source of the 3rd child's infection is currently
unknown. That child's family also eats halal food [food seen as permissible
according to Islamic law (Sharia). - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ] but did not purchase
any food from the same store. The public is being advised not to eat any
ground beef or kofta products purchased from the store between [2 Jun] and
Sunday [28 Jun 2009].

[Kofta (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keftedes>) is a family of meatball or
meatloaf dishes in Middle Eastern, South Asian, and Balkan cuisines. In the
simplest form, koftas consist of balls of minced or ground meat, usually
beef or lamb -- mixed with spices and/or onions. The word kofta is derived
from Persian kufta: In Persian, kuftan means "to beat" or "to grind".

The most important line in the posting relates to the need to cook ground
beef adequately. The meat is certainly not sterile, and bacteria will
persist in undercooked areas. This is especially true for organisms like
_E. coli_ O157:H7 that require only a small number of ingested bacteria to
cause disease.

Hints to prevent this illness related to ground beef can be found at
<http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/dfbmd/disease_listing/stec_gi.html#16>, and include
1. Because ground beef can turn brown before disease-causing bacteria are
killed, use a digital instant-read meat thermometer to ensure thorough
cooking. Ground beef should be cooked until a thermometer inserted into
several parts of the patty, including the thickest part, reads at least 160
deg F (71 deg C). Those who cook ground beef without using a thermometer
can decrease their risk of illness by not eating ground beef patties that
are still pink in the middle.
2. If you are served an undercooked hamburger or other ground beef product
in a restaurant, send it back for further cooking. You may want to ask for
a new bun and a clean plate, too.
3. Avoid spreading harmful bacteria in your kitchen. Keep raw meat separate
from ready-to-eat foods. Wash hands, counters, and utensils with hot soapy
water after they touch raw meat. Never place cooked hamburgers or ground
beef on the unwashed plate that held raw patties. Wash meat thermometers in
between tests of patties that require further cooking. - Mod.LL
