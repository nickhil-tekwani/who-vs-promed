The influenza season has begun in the WHO European Region
---------------------------------------------------------
[The EuroFlu bulletin describes and comments on influenza activity in the 53 member states in the WHO European Region to provide information to public health specialists, clinicians, and the public on the timing of the influenza season, the spread of influenza, and the prevalence and characteristics of circulating viruses (type, subtype, and lineage) and their severity.]

Week 50: 12-18 Dec 2012 - summary
---------------------------------
The influenza season has begun in the WHO European Region, with growing numbers of countries in different parts of the Region reporting sporadic co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and type B viruses, though influenza activity is still at a low level. Further, the percentage of influenza-positive sentinel samples has increased over the past 2 weeks (from 6 per cent to 15.8 per cent) together with the number of specimens tested for influenza, indicating the start of the influenza season. The number of reported hospitalizations due to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) remains similar to that seen in the previous several weeks, with 2 cases associated with confirmed influenza infection, one each of types A and B.

Virological surveillance for influenza
--------------------------------------
The number of specimens testing positive for influenza has increased steadily in the past weeks, mainly due to influenza viruses detected in Norway, France, and the United Kingdom. Overall, a total of 577 specimens tested positive for influenza in week 50/2012: 338 were type A and 239 were type B. Of the influenza A viruses, 191 were subtyped: 70 as A(H3N2) and 121 as A(H1N1)pdm09.

During week 50/2012, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (Scotland) reported dominant viruses as influenza A, with Belgium, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom (Wales and Northern Ireland) reporting influenza B as the dominant type. It is too early to assess which influenza viruses will dominate this season as the number of detections is still relatively low.

Since week 40/2012 [3-9 Oct 2012], 6 countries (Denmark, the United Kingdom (England), Germany, Latvia, Portugal, Romania) have characterized 54 influenza viruses antigenically. This corresponds with the viruses recommended by WHO for inclusion in the current northern hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine. 8 countries (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden) have characterized 91 influenza viruses genetically.

Monitoring of susceptibility to antiviral drugs
-----------------------------------------------
Since week 40/2012, 7 countries (Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) have screened 60 viruses for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. The 26 influenza A(H3N2) viruses, 27 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses and 7 influenza B viruses showed susceptibility to oseltamivir and zanamivir. The 14 influenza A(H3N2) and 5 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses screened for susceptibility to adamantanes were found to be resistant.

Outpatient surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI)
--------------------------------------------------------
Consultation rates for ILI and ARI are still low throughout the WHO European Region (Map 2 -- see the source URL above), with 3 countries (Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (England)) reported regional or widespread circulation of influenza (Map 3), and 17 of 41 reported increasing trends.

Of the 1082 specimens from sentinel sources, 91 tested positive for influenza A and 80 for influenza B (Fig 6a -- see the source URL above). Fig 6b gives a detailed overview of cumulative influenza virus detections by type and subtype since week 40/2012. [A detailed overview in a table format is available at the source URL above].

Hospital surveillance for SARI
------------------------------
Hospitalizations due to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) continue to be stable and at pre-season levels in the 10 countries reporting this week (Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, and Ukraine). Most cases occurred in the age group 0-4 years.

To date, only a few influenza detections have been reported by the hospitals participating in SARI surveillance, similar to the situation in outpatient surveillance in these countries. In week 50, 2 cases tested positive among 122 specimens collected from hospitalized SARI cases in 8 countries (Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine); the Russian Federation reported 1 SARI case positive for influenza B and Ukraine reported 1 case positive for A(H3N2). Since week 40/2012, 1305 SARI specimens have been tested for influenza, with only 10 cases being positive for influenza.

[The winter influenza season has begun now throughout the European Region. No novel viruses have made their appearance and the current northern hemisphere vaccine is well matched to contain the outbreak. No particular virus predominates so far and there are marked differences in the frequencies of the antigenic types isolated, both between and within countries (such as in the UK).

The data in the EuroFlu report are supplemented by diagrams and graphs, which interested readers are recommended to consult. - Mod.CP
