Yellow leaf curl disease of pumpkin in Thailand is associated with
_Squash leaf curl China virus_
-----------------------------------------------
Yellow leaf curl disease causes heavy losses to cucurbit crops in
Thailand. Previously, we have detected _Tomato leaf curl New Delhi
virus_ from infected cucumber (_Cucumis sativus_), wax gourd
(_Benincasa hispida_), cantaloupe (_Cucumis melo_) and muskmelon
(_Cucumis melo_) plants in Thailand. Pumpkin (_Cucurbita pepo_) is
also severely affected by this disease. Three pumpkin plants
exhibiting leaf curling and yellowing symptoms (Fig.1) were collected
from Kamphaensaen, Nakom Pathom in Thailand during 2001.

PCR [Polymerase Chain Reaction] was conducted specific for
begomovirus DNA-A. A product of the full DNA A was sequenced (2736
nucleotides). Efforts to detect DNA-B component associated with the
virus by PCR were unsuccessful. The DNA-A contained the 5 open
reading frames [ORF] typical of begomoviruses, 2 in the virion sense
and 3 in the complementary sense. Comparison of the complete
nucleotide sequence of this begomovirus with those of full-length
begomoviral DNA-A's available showed the highest nucleotide sequence
identity (95 and 89 percent) with _Squash leaf curl China virus_
(SLCCNV) and _Squash leaf curl Philippines virus_ (SLCPHV),
respectively. For ORF V1 (coat protein), this begomovirus had the
highest amino acid sequence identity with its counterparts in SLCCNV
(97 percent) and SLCPHV (97 percent).

Therefore, the present virus is an isolate of SLCCNV, which we
designate SLCCNV-Thailand. This is a 1st report of SLCCNV infecting
pumpkin in Thailand.

[The _Cucurbitaceae_ contain many crops of importance to human
nutrition worldwide. Plant viruses that infect edible cucurbits pose
major constraints to cucurbit production. Among the most important
are the circular single-stranded DNA whitefly-transmitted viruses in
the family _Geminiviridae_. This family includes the genus
_Begomovirus_ to which _Squash leaf curl China virus_ (SLCCNV) and
other members of the squash leaf curl viral clade belong. SLCCNV has
so far been reported from China and Viet Nam, whereas other members
of the clade have been found in different regions. Other clades of
begomoviruses are, for example, the tomato leaf curl complex, which
includes _Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus_ mentioned above, and the
tomato yellow leaf curl complex. All these viruses generally cause
symptoms of leaf yellowing and distortion leading to reduced plant
vigor and yield losses, but they may vary in host range and
geographical distribution.

All cucurbit-infecting begomoviruses reported at present have a
bipartite genome (called DNA-A and DNA-B in the report above).
Begomoviruses are transmitted by whitefly vectors and can often also
be transmitted by mechanical means and grafting.

Whiteflies are widely distributed and have a very wide host range of
more than 600 plant species. Weed species can serve as insect
reservoirs making control difficult. Whiteflies have been reported to
transmit over 100 virus species, including many begomoviruses, but
also cause serious crop damage by direct feeding.

Disease management of begomoviruses relies on control of the vector
and possible pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants. This has
occasionally caused problems with chemical residues on fruits. In
some cases, crop cultivars with increased virus resistance are available.
