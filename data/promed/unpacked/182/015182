South Korea has detected bird flu in ducks on a poultry farm near Seoul, an agriculture ministry official told Reuters today [28 Mar 2016], the 1st discovery in 4 months and a month after the country regained its bird flu-free status. The case involved a strain known as H5N8, the same type of influenza that occurred last November [2015]. All 11 604 ducks at the infected farm in the city of Icheon [Gyeonggi province], 80 km [about 50 mi] east of Seoul have been slaughtered, the official said.

South Korea had resumed poultry meat exports to Hong Kong for the 1st time in nearly 2 years, after it was declared an avian influenza-free nation, the agriculture ministry said on 13 Mar 2016. The bird flu discovery comes amid ongoing concerns about food safety in South Korea, where an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease was discovered in pigs in January [2016].

[The current media report refers to an outbreak which has been covered in ProMED-mail posting 20160327.4121479, which included a request for information on its serotyping, which appears to be H5N8.

This means a recurrence of the HPAI H5N8 virus, which caused the previous event in South Korea, starting 24 Sep 2014, declared resolved 12 Feb 2016. During the event, 179 outbreaks were notified to the OIE and more than 4.3 million domestic birds (chickens and ducks) were destroyed.

The causative agent was detected in January 2014, also in migratory birds, which have been suspected to be the introducers to South Korea. - Mod.AS
