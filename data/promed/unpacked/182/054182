A rare _E. coli_ [O157:H7] outbreak in Huntsville has continued to
spread, with 8 more people testing positive for the dangerous
foodborne illness, bringing the total to 15, health officials said
Mon 9 Jul 2007.
Dr. Debra Williams, the Huntsville-Madison County Health Department's
assistant director, said 2 other people are suffering kidney failure,
a potential complication of the illness, but continue to test
negative for the _E. coli_.
The victims are 5 to 48 years old. The youngest victim, a boy from
Meridianville, was taken by ambulance Sun 8 Jul 2007, to Vanderbilt
University Medical Center and may have to undergo dialysis, said his
grandfather. The CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
said about 8 percent of people sickened by _E. coli_ O157:H7 bacteria
develop kidney failure, which can cause lifelong kidney problems.
Besides the 5-year-old, 4 other area residents remain hospitalized --
2 at Crestwood Medical Center, one at Huntsville Hospital, and
another in Asheville, NC. Several more admitted to hospitals on or
around the '4th of July' [holiday] have been released, Williams said.
_E. coli_ O157 is found in the intestines of cattle, deer, goats, and
sheep and can accidentally contaminate meat during slaughter. Most
infections in the USA are linked to eating undercooked ground beef,
the CDC says. Other known sources: sprouts, lettuce, salami,
unpasteurized milk, and juice, and swimming in or drinking
sewage-tainted water.
The cause of the outbreak remains a mystery. Many of those sickened
ate at 'Little Rosie's Taqueria' on Whitesburg Drive in late June
2007, Williams said, but others had not visited the popular
restaurant. "That just means we've got to start digging a little
deeper," she said.
Williams expects more victims to surface in the coming days since it
can take up to a week to identify the bacterium in stool samples.
"Many more people may have been sickened," she said.
Until the source of the outbreak is found, the restaurant has been
closed because the restaurant is a "common denominator" in many of the cases.
Williams said this is the 1st _E. coli_ outbreak in Alabama in her
23-year public health career. Madison County typically has half-dozen
or fewer unrelated cases a year, she said.

[The vehicle or vehicles for this outbreak remain unknown. It is
likely that this is forthcoming. Unlike most enteric bacterial
pathogens other than _Shigella_, the inoculum to cause infection with
_E. coli_ O157:H7 is low so that person-to-person spread can occur,
especially in a household, school, or daycare facility. - Mod.LL]
