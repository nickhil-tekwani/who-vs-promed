Note from the editors: Acute hepatitis among children, establishing evidence and baselines for comparison
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two Rapid Communications in this issue report on attempts to gauge the extent of the recently reported increase in acute hepatitis cases among children in several countries in Europe and on other continents. They show that at the start of a possible outbreak with a yet unknown etiology but features suggestive of an infectious cause, it is challenging to establish a sound evidence-base and to measure increase against a baseline of a syndrome or disease which is not under systematic surveillance and governed by standard case definitions. The short communications by van Beek et al. [1] and de Kleine et al. [2] both report results on quick surveys among different networks of clinical experts working with (pediatric) liver diseases and use different approaches to try and shed light on whether there is --or is not-- a widespread increase. Both cover a similar period in 2022 and apply a similar case definition for acute hepatitis of unknown etiology.

Van Beek et al. set out to establish the incidence for acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in children over the previous 5 years (2017 to 21) as comparison baseline to assess the increase and included data from the UK. They further investigate geographical distribution of cases up to [26 Apri 2022]. In 2022, of 24 countries with experts responding, 5 of 17 identified an increase in probable cases of unexplained acute hepatitis in European countries and in 1 of 7 non-European countries. An increase in severe cases was noted in 5 European countries.

De Kleine et al. establish estimates of paediatric acute liver failure (pALF) registered by specialised liver centers within the European Reference Network on Hepatological Diseases over 3 previous years (2019 to 21) that fulfil the definition of the Paediatric Acute Liver Failure Study Group [3]. The survey also captures the number of pediatric hepatitis cases and pALF at the centers in the first 3.8 months of 2022. The 34 participating centres in Europe and Israel, not including the UK, detected a mean of 2 (range: 0-8) up to [26 Apr 2022]. A total of 12 reported a suspected increase but documented no rise in numbers, and 22 reported no suspicion of an increase. Of 64 children with severe hepatitis and/or pALF with further details available, a cause was identified in 11, while for 27 it remained indeterminate and for 26 unknown.

The results from these surveys show that the condition remains rare also in 2022. They do not provide a uniform picture but indicate that while in some countries or centres there are signals for an increase in cases, this is not evident in others. As examples of the former, Marsh et al. described the clear signal seen in Scotland and the initial investigation and clinical details of the first Scottish cases on [14 Apr 2022] [4] and the UK Health Security Agency published a technical briefing on [25 Apr 2022] [5].

Despite acknowledged limitations, the 2 Rapid Communications in this issue provide some useful information in the form of 'best available evidence' at this moment in time. International collaboration is needed to support robust and timely epidemiological and clinical investigations to establish if there is an excess of cases of severe hepatitis of unknown origin that demands targeted studies to determine the etiological agent. Over the coming weeks we hope to see more data and results from ongoing investigations that should help to fill the present gaps.

Missouri health officials say they are investigating about 10 cases of a mysterious form of hepatitis that has sickened hundreds of healthy, young children across the USA, the UK and several other countries. Officials with the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services are working with the CDC in the investigation and will not yet say where the cases were reported in Missouri or how severe they were, said Lisa Cox, DHSS spokeswoman. "We are in the process of collecting information, so what we do have is very limited, preliminary and likely to change," Cox said.

The CDC began to zero in on the cases last month and on [Fri 6 May 2022], said it was investigating a total 109 cases of hepatitis, inflammation of the liver, in children in 24 states and Puerto Rico where the hepatitis is "of unknown cause." The cases have been reported in the past 7 months, and the children are otherwise healthy. While most of the children have fully recovered, more than 90% were hospitalized, 5 have died and 14% required liver transplants, federal officials said.

What has experts stumped is the cause. The most common causes of viral hepatitis are hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses. But in these cases, those causes were ruled out. In more than half of the cases, the children were found to be infected with a common adenovirus type 41, which typically causes diarrhea, vomiting and fever. Adenoviruses spread through contact with respiratory secretions when someone coughs or sneezes. While it is not unusual for the cause of hepatitis cases to be unknown, it is unusual for adenovirus to cause hepatitis in healthy children, experts say. It is also unusual for healthy children to suffer with severe outcomes such as a transplant or death.

Washington University pediatric gastroenterologist Dr. Janis Stoll, who cares for patients at St. Louis Children's Hospital, said hospital staff have seen an unusual uptick of acute hepatitis in children over the past few months where the cause was either adenovirus or unknown. "There seemed to be more coming to us an outpatient or even coming into the hospital," Stoll said.

The severity of the cases also caught doctors' attention. "If you are not immunocompromised ... usually adenovirus is a run-of-the-mill virus that we see in kids frequently that may, in some cases cause liver enzyme elevation, but not to this degree in normal healthy kids," Stoll said.

Experts say they are casting a wide net in trying to determine the cause. They are looking at environmental factors such as an infection from a family pet or some other interaction makes adenovirus or the body's immune response more dangerous to kids. Despite speculation, experts say the COVID-19 vaccines are not responsible for the illnesses. Most of the cases involve children under the age of 5 who are not yet even eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

State health officials are warning parents to be on the lookout for rare cases of hepatitis in their children. As of [Wed 11 May 2022], there are 9 pediatric cases in the state, up from 4 last week.

Doctors stress that hepatitis, which is known to cause severe liver damage, isn't usually common in children. Currently, the CDC is looking at more than 100 possible cases and 5 deaths.

"It's very odd for us to have these number of cases," said pediatrician Dr. Steven Lichtman.

Two possible cases of severe acute hepatitis with no known cause have been identified in Alberta, Dr. Deena Hinshaw announced [Wed 11 May 2022]. The chief medical officer of health said 1 patient has been treated and discharged from the hospital, while the other remains in hospital. Citing patient confidentiality, she said she could not provide information on where the cases were found but that they were both in children under the age of 16.

"It is important to remember that the definition for possible cases is very broad, which means that any child with severe liver inflammation for whom a cause is not found is being counted," said Hinshaw. "There are many causes of hepatitis and it can take time to investigate to determine if there is a known cause. This means that a case may initially present in one of these possible unknown cause categories but, after further investigation or testing, a diagnosis may be determined. If that happens, the case would be removed from the possible case count."

Hinshaw said parents should understand that the reporting of these cases does not mean there is an elevated risk of disease in the community.

Alberta's potential infections were reported after several other provinces identified cases. In Ontario, there have been 7 probable cases found, including a child who needed to be flown from the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa to SickKids hospital in Toronto for urgent treatment in December 2021. The Canadian cases come amid clusters of the disease being found around the world, although health officials have stated it is too early to tell if the number of cases is different from in past years.

"More information is needed to assess the situation and any potential risks to people in Canada," federal chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam said in a tweet this week.

The Health Service Executive has confirmed that a child who was being treated for an acute form of hepatitis has died. A 2nd child who was also being treated for the same illness has received a liver transplant. Both cases are being linked to an unexplained type of hepatitis that is being reported in children worldwide.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has said the total number of cases reported worldwide is approximately 450. An alert about this disease in children was first raised by the UK in early April [2022]. It has since been identified in dozens of countries, including Ireland.

The HSE said that over the last 2 months approximately, 6 probable cases of children with hepatitis of unknown cause have been detected in Ireland. The 6 children were aged between 1 and 12 years of age. All were hospitalized. In addition, a small number of other cases are being assessed to see if they are linked to this acute hepatitis of unknown origin or if they have another cause for their illness.

The HSE said the cause of acute hepatitis in these children has not yet been found and all possibilities are being investigated at present. 1 area being explored is whether the hepatitis cases are linked to an increase in infections caused by adenovirus, a common cause of childhood illness. Other possible causes such as another infection, including COVID-19, or something in the environment, are also being investigated.

In Ireland, as in other countries, investigations are under way to determine if current or prior COVID-19 infection may increase the risk of this disease in some children. None of the Irish cases who were tested on admission to hospital had evidence of COVID-19 infection at that time.

The majority of the cases had not received COVID-19 vaccination. Ireland is liaising closely with ECDC, UK and WHO colleagues in efforts to identify the cause of this illness.

The HSE's National Clinical Lead for Children and Young People has said a lot of work is being done to find a cause and to be able to support those affected.

Speaking on RTE's Today with Claire Byrne, Dr. Ciara Martin, who is also a consultant in pediatric emergency medicine at Children's Health Ireland, said it is a difficult situation because they are asking parents to look out for something, while also trying to reassure them that doctors manage hepatitis on a regular basis. "For parents ... if you're looking for signs of hepatitis, the general signs would be temperature, muscle pain, aches and pains - but you see that with a lot of viruses. "The difference here is if the [child's] poop is paler, grey colored ... or if the urine is a darker color than usual, or if you think that your child looks a little yellow around the eyes and skin, they're certainly signs that your liver is inflamed.

"In those cases, we're asking you to contact your GP or local emergency department."

Jakarta Deputy Governor Ahmad Riza Patria stated that there were 21 suspected cases of mysterious acute hepatitis in the capital. According to him, all of them are local cases. "There are 21 cases in Jakarta, and 3 of them died," said Riza at City Hall, Central Jakarta on [Wed 11 May 2022].

However, he stopped short of detailing the information regarding the age range of patients suspected of contracting the acute hepatitis or liver inflammation of unknown origin. Detailed information, he added, could be asked to the Jakarta Health Agency. "But what we must know is that acute hepatitis does not only attack children, but also adults," Riza underlined.

The Gerindra politician also said the 21 suspected cases of mysterious acute hepatitis are still under epidemiological investigation. He appealed to the public to stay vigilant and comply with the health protocols. The Jakarta provincial government, he went on, continued to coordinate with the Health Ministry in evaluating and monitoring cases of the unknown acute hepatitis.

Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin had stated that the first 3 cases of acute hepatitis in Indonesia were reported on [27 Apr 2022], days after the WHO announced an outbreak in Europe. On the same day, the ministry immediately issued a circular for all hospitals and health agencies to carry out surveillance and monitoring of these cases.

Infection with the omicron variant of the coronavirus may have a role in recent cases of severe acute hepatitis in children, according to new research presented at a health ministry panel meeting [Wed 11 May 2022].

Kyoto University professor Hiroshi Nishiura told the ministry's coronavirus advisory board that countries with a large number of omicron infections such as Britain and the USA were also found to have reported a relatively higher number of childhood hepatitis cases.

According to the World Health Organization, 348 probable cases of unexplained hepatitis in children have been confirmed worldwide, with only 6 countries reporting more than 5 cases. Japan's health ministry has identified 7 domestic cases so far, while the USA is currently investigating 109 child hepatitis cases of unknown origin, according to the CDC.

Adenovirus, a common virus that can cause a range of illnesses including gastroenteritis (stomach flu), has been suspected as a possible cause of the severe liver disease. In Britain, which has reported 163 cases so far, 126 cases have been tested for adenovirus. Among them, adenovirus was detected in 72%, or 91 cases, according to the UK Health Security Agency. The agency says that over 75% of the children are age 5 or younger.

Patient symptoms correspond with the WHO's working definition of a "probable case" of the acute, severe hepatitis. Reported symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, jaundice and elevated liver enzyme levels. Such probable cases are defined as hospitalized patients who have seen spikes in their liver enzyme levels, but for which hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D and E have all been ruled out as the cause.

Nishiura told reporters after the panel meeting that, since toddlers and infants are currently ineligible for coronavirus vaccine shots, they may be at an increased risk of severe hepatitis following their adenovirus infection if they are in countries where large-scale COVID-19 infections are occurring. Further research is necessary to establish a causal link between omicron infections and child hepatitis, Nishiura said, pointing to the limitations of his study, such as omicron infection data that covers all ages, and not just children.

"We cannot deny the possibility that infection with omicron has some relation to the occurrence of severe hepatitis in children," Nishiura stated in the presentation submitted to the panel. To prevent acute childhood hepatitis, he said, governments should focus on mitigating the spread of the omicron variant.

In the research, soon to be published in an academic journal, Nishiura's team looked at the relationship between the cumulative number of omicron cases in 38 OECD countries and Romania between [1 Dec 2021] and [27 Apr 2022], and the reported number of probable cases of severe child hepatitis as defined by the WHO until [27 Apr 2022]. As of that date, 12 countries had reported cases.

"At present, the leading hypotheses remain those which involve adenovirus, with also still an important consideration about the role of COVID as well, either as a co-infection or a past infection," Philippa Easterbrook, a scientist with the WHO's global hepatitis program, told a news conference on [Tue 10 May 2022].

[As more cases are reported as in the USA states of Missouri and North Carolina above, it remains unclear when most of the cases occurred. A chart showing date and 1st day of symptoms in the USA, Canada, UK and EU and elsewhere would be quite useful. There have always been cases of hepatitis of varying severity in children without a cause so until the etiology is defined, it is unknown if the cases represent hepatitis from one cause.

The editorial from today's (12 May 2022) Eurosurveillance summarizes 2 reports that looked back via survey at cases of pediatric hepatitis including some period before the COVID-19 pandemic. In a study by Van Beek, et al. (van Beek J, Fraaij PLA, Giaquinto C, et al.: Case numbers of acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology among children in 24 countries up to 18 April 2022 compared to the previous 5 years. Euro Surveill. 2022;27(19):2200370. https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.19.2200370), Italy, Spain, Sweden, UK, Ukraine and Israel (of 24 countries) seemed to have higher numbers in 2022. The USA was not in the survey. In the de Klein et al. study, a survey of European pediatric liver centers (de Kleine RH, Lexmond WS, Buescher G, et al.: Severe acute hepatitis and acute liver failure of unknown origin in children: a questionnaire-based study within 34 paediatric liver centres in 22 European countries and Israel, April 2022. Euro Surveill. 2022;27(19):2200369. https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.19.2200369), it was concluded that there was no clear overall increase in the occurrence of severe hepatitis or pALF in children in Europe, when comparing the reported data of previous years to the preliminary data from the study period of 3.8 months in 2022. By 26 Apr 2022, only a minority of the centers within the ERN RARE-LIVER appear to be affected by a possible rise in hepatitis cases. No increase in virus-derived hepatitis could be detected at this point in time within the whole group of participating centers. However, close monitoring will be necessary in order to achieve early signal detection of this clinical condition. Both studies are surveys which by their nature contribute to reporter bias but such data is important to assess how much this is a new problem. Both studies are available on the Eurosurveillance website (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/). More data and more complete data of this kind are needed.

To emphasize, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) is not always due to inflammation of the liver as obstruction of the biliary tract from, for instance, gall stones will cause jaundice as can brisk hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells). Additionally, Gilbert's syndrome, a defect in the processing of bilirubin in the liver, can cause scleral icterus (eye yellowing). These conditions can be suspected based on blood tests. Hepatitis, besides being caused by the classical hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, D and E), can be caused by other infectious agents most that have not been identified in these cases except for adenovirus serotype 41 and/or SARS-CoV-2, in some cases. No evidence of other agents exists as yet except for metagenomic studies in the UK finding evidence of adenovirus-associated virus 2 (AAV2). AAV2 has not been known to cause hepatitis and the finding of it may represent the fact that the virus can integrate into the human genome. The AAV2 finding has not been reported one way or the other in USA cases. Hepatitis can also be toxic in nature from ethanol and drugs such as acetaminophen.

ProMED awaits Dr. Nishiura's publication regarding correlations between this liver disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

To date, no peer-reviewed studies on this growing outbreak have been published. ProMED awaits more information including blood and liver metagenomics, evidence for past COVID-19 infection, and screening of asymptomatic household contacts for elevated aminotransferases. - Mod.LL]
