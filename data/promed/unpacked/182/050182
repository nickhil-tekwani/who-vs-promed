Is a new wave of the human form of mad cow disease about to sweep
through the UK? That's the question raised by what could be the 1st
case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (vCJD) in someone
genetically distinct from all previous cases. So far, 160 people in
the UK are known to have died from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,
but all of them have had the MM [methionine/methionine] variant of
the gene that makes prions, the proteins which become misshapen when
the disease takes hold and fatally clog up the brain. About 40 per
cent of the UK population carry the MM variant, which occurs when 2
copies of the amino acid methionine are present [i.e. encoded] at a
specific site in the prion gene.
Now, a similar but not identical case of vCJD has killed a
39-year-old woman with the V/V [valine/valine] variant of the gene,
which carries [encodes] 2 valine amino acids at the same position

Fears of a new wave of deaths caused by the human form of mad cow
disease have been raised by a type of vCJD (variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob
disease) not seen before. Scientists who examined the brain of a
39-year-old woman killed by the disease found unusual patterns of
damage. The woman also had a distinct genetic make-up associated with
her illness not shared by other victims. Investigations are still at
an early stage, but the findings point to the possibility of a new
group of people succumbing to vCJD as a result of eating infected
beef in the 1980s. The disease, linked to misshapen prion proteins in
the brain, has varying incubation periods according to genetic
make-up. Experts believe that for many of those infected, the timer
[clock] could still be ticking. They might not develop symptoms for
decades after acquiring the disease or die from other causes before
getting ill. In some cases, the incubation period might exceed 50
years.
vCJD originally arose in cattle as bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE), or "mad cow disease," before appearing in a new form in
humans. The incurable disease leaves the brain riddled with holes
like a sponge causing a loss of mental faculties and death. Since the
disease was 1st recognised in 1995, there have been 162 confirmed or
suspected deaths in the UK. Fears of an epidemic involving hundreds
of thousands of deaths abated after the number of annual deaths
peaked at 28 in 2000 and then quickly fell. In the year up to 30 Nov
2007, there were just 4 definite or probable cases. All these people
had the MM [methionine/methionine] version of the gene that makes
prions, which is carried by about 40 percent of the population.
The woman recently examined by scientists at the Medical Research
Council's Prion Unit at University College London had a different
gene variant, known as VV [valine/valine], found in about 10 percent
of Britons.

[This is a significant and unsettling observation. The result
described above suggests that the approximately 12 percent of the UK
population who may have consumed cattle tissue during the BSE era,
and who are heterozygous (M/V) at codon 129 of the PrP gene, could be
at risk of developing a distinctive form of vCJD with a long
incubation period.
The result leaves a question mark over the susceptibility of the
approximately 51 per cent of the UK population who are heterozygous
(M/V) at codon 129 of the PrP gene. - Mod.CP]
