FMD update: vaccination decision and further test results
---------------------------------------------------------
The option to vaccinate is a central element of the contingency planning
arrangements in foot and mouth disease [FMD] outbreaks. The arrangements to
enable vaccination were triggered again immediately following confirmation
of disease on 12 Sep 2007. The Forward Vaccination Centre, with teams ready
to vaccinate should the decision be taken, was in place by 17 Sep 2007.
A decision has been taken today [18 Sep 2007] not to vaccinate at this
stage, but we retain the ability to do so should the disease situation change.
Chief veterinary officer, Debby Reynolds said, "Vaccination can be used as
a disease control measure if it is demonstrated that steps in additional to
the slaughter policy are required to eradicate the disease. Any decision to
vaccinate follows the FMD vaccination decision tree in the contingency plan
[* see footnote].
"In line with this decision tree, it has been decided not to vaccinate at
this time because the risk of spread of disease outside of the Surrey area
is still considered to be low at the present time. However, this approach
will be kept under constant review as this is a developing situation and
therefore the Forward Vaccination Centre will be kept in place."
It was also confirmed today [18 Sep 2007] that laboratory tests on pigs
slaughtered on suspicion on 15 Sep 2007 at a farm in Surrey have proved
negative for FMD.

Federal organisation of German veterinarians: Press release PM 11/07
--------------------------------------------------------------------
In light of the latest outbreak of FMD in the UK the German veterinary
association (BTK) is urging the German Government to stage a protest
against the trade restrictions following emergency vaccination against FMD.
They are asking that intracommunity as well as global trade in vaccinated
animals and their products (milk and meat) should not be restricted.
"The use of emergency vaccination in outbreak regions without subsequent
culling of vaccinated animals can prevent the disease from spreading as
well as keeping the numbers of animals to be culled at an absolute minimum"
says Dr Ernst Breitling, president of the German federal veterinary
organization, BTK.
Since 1992 no preventive vaccination against FMD has been carried out
within the territory of the EU. In case of an outbreak the veterinary
authorities can decide, pending permission from the European Commission, to
carry out emergency vaccination in regions affected.
Usually this will lead to a prolonged period of trade restrictions for
vaccinated animals and their products within the European Union and 3rd
countries. The reasons for trade restrictions are the assumptions that
vaccinated animals can't be distinguished from infected animals. But
meanwhile modern marker vaccines are available that permit on a herd level
the distinction between vaccinated and infected animals.
Improvements, that is, safe tests for individual animals, are needed. But
most important, today it is possible to prove the infection of a single
animal by virus detection. The BTK has no sympathy for (opposes?) the
culling of healthy animals for trade reasons.
Losses in trade that are always used as an argument against vaccination
are, in our opinion, less important than the implications for animal welfare.

[3] Recent outbreak: impact upon sheep industry
Date: Wed 19 Sep 2007

<http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article2485391.ece>

A new outbreak of FMD has been confirmed in cattle at the Krondyke Farm in
Virginia Water, Surrey, where sheep were slaughtered on suspicion of
infection on Monday night [17 Sep 2007].
It also emerged that a cow was moved from the 20-acre (8-hectare) farm last
Tuesday [11 Sep 2007] for slaughter at a Welsh abattoir. The farm, above,
has been owned by the [same] family for 100 years. The news immediately
fuelled concerns among farmers in Wales who fear that the disease will have
spread across their borders.
Government vets traced the beef carcass to the St Merryn Meat Company
premises in Merthyr Tydfil and it has been removed from the food chain for
testing. No disease has been found and there are no suspect animals on the
premises.
Debby Reynolds, the Government's chief veterinary officer, said yesterday
[18 Sep 2007] that vaccination would not be used to control the FMD
outbreak in Surrey while the risk of spread to other parts of the country
remained low.
Teams remain on standby near Guildford in case there is any evidence that
the disease has spread outside the protection zone or is widespread in a
particular species.

[4] Resuming export: prospects and timetable
Date: Wed 19 Sep 2007

The resumption of exports of beef and lamb is seen as a key element in
restoring financial viability to farming, but the situation is not quite as
simple as some producers may believe. Stuart Ashworth of Quality Meat
Scotland, the red meat promotional agency, has prepared a background paper
that details the complex nature of the livestock and processing sectors.
He said: "Export markets are more important to the sheep sector, at 25 per
cent of production, compared with the beef industry, where only 3 per cent
of the output is exported. However, trade patterns result in an estimated
33 per cent of Scottish beef and 10 per cent of lamb consumption being
imported."
There have been repeated calls over the past week for Scotland to adopt a
regional approach to winding down the restrictions imposed because of
foot-and-mouth disease. But trade within the UK is complex -- Ashworth
points out that up to a fifth of the beef and lamb "imported" into Scotland
may have originated north of the Border, before passing through
intermediaries in England and Wales.
In normal times a large number of Scottish lambs are delivered each week to
abattoirs as far south as Kent and Wales, but the principal processing
locations are in Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Cheshire. If Scotland was to
regionalise, there could be problems in returning that lamb for sale in
supermarkets before England is clear of the disease. The situation with
beef is similar.
The pig sector is feeling the pain most acutely; high feed costs and the
loss of export markets are placing producers under extreme pressure.
Ashworth said: "Around 5000 tonnes of pig meat from Scotland is exported
outwith [out of. - CopyEd.MJ] the UK each year, predominately made up of
heads, feet, and offals. This trade is worth about BP 3 [USD 6] per pig,
but with no UK market for these products, disposal costs are also around BP
3 per pig. This means that the loss of export markets costs BP 6 per pig
[USD 12], or potentially over BP 4 million [USD 8 million] in a full year
to the Scottish industry."
It is highly unlikely that exports from the UK will be permitted until late
October [2007] at the earliest. If Scotland goes alone it could be sooner,
but resuming the trade will not be without difficulties.

[The UK is a country which does not vaccinate against FMD and where
stamping out is applied. Such countries are, according to OIE's (Office
International des Epizooties; World Organisation for Animal Health) Code,
able to regain their freedom from FMD 3 months after the culling of the
last FMD case. In case of limited outbreaks, earlier resumption of exports
from uninfected areas has become possible since the OIE adoption of the
Containment zone principles. The terms for the establishment of a
containment zone, securing its recognition by trade partners, are spelled
out in article 2.2.10.7 of the Code. For details see commentary in
