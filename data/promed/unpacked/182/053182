[1] Liberia hunter case negative, no bat contact
Date: 14 Apr 2014
Source: Richard Nisbett <rnisbett@tubmanu.edu.lr> [summarized by Mod.JW, edited]


Dr Nesbit has 25 years experience in Liberia and states that nobody traps bats in Liberia; they are hunted with bow and arrow; they are not worth using firearms to kill them. The unfortunate hunter's traps were probably snares for small antelope like duikers.

In any case, the hunter died and tested negative for ebolavirus.

(He says this information is still not entirely confirmed).

[2] Sierra Leone - no new cases
Date: 13 Apr 2014
Source: Ebola Update from Sierra Leone, official [edited]


As for 13 Apr 2014, there has been no laboratory confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone (since 19 Mar 2014): the Metabiota Laboratory team in Kenema have received and tested 27 samples collected from 11 suspected acute hemorrhagic fever cases and 16 potential contacts. All (27) tested negative for Ebola fever.

All samples (27) were tested for ebolavirus (Ebola virus Zaire species) using 2 different real-time PCR protocols. IgM and IgG ELISA assays for Ebola virus have been set up and will be used efficiently for the follow-up of the contacts of Ebola suspected cases. Complementary tests including antigen capture (kindly provided and in partnership with USAMRIID) will also be set up in the coming days.

Viral Hemorrhagic fever, VHF
---------------------------
During the present period (Ebola outbreak in Guinea), all samples collected from acute suspected VHF cases and addressed to the Lassa Ward (Dr. Kahn) at the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) are to be tested for Lassa virus as well as ebolavirus and, in accordance with the clinical picture, for other viruses potentially responsible for hemorrhagic fevers in the sub-region, including: Marburg virus, Rift Valley Fever virus, Yellow Fever virus, Dengue [4 types?]. Also, in agreement with the clinical picture and in a differential diagnosis approach, samples can/will eventually be tested for other emerging viruses including: West Nile virus and chikungunya among others.

All acute 27 samples tested also negative for several other pathogens including Lassa, Marburg, West Nile, among others potentially prevalent in the region.

The KGH Lassa Fever team and their partners, including Tulane University and Metabiota have been engaged with central MoHS since the announcement of an Ebola outbreak in Guinea. Specialist Physician Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan has been integrally involved in the national task force, providing technical expertise on case management, biosafety, surveillance and response and training. The KGH outreach team led by Lansana Kanneh and Dr. Lina Moses of Tulane University were among the 1st to respond to reports of suspicious deaths in Kailahun and Kono Districts and were primary investigators, providing logistical support, with the team that identified the 2 probable Ebola cases that were repatriated to Kono District. This team was led by District Medical Officer Dr. Francis Jayah and included District Surveillance Officers and staff of Metabiota.

More than 40 medical staff including Medical Officers, nurses, midwives, surveillance officers and laboratory staff are currently at the KGH Lassa Laboratory to participate in the Training of Trainers (TOT) organized by the Ministry and its partners (Metabiota and Tulane University) on Preparedness and Response to Ebola fever.

Ebola virus disease, West Africa (Situation as of [14 Apr 2014])
----------------
Guinea
As of [14 Apr 2014], the Ministry of Health of Guinea has reported a cumulative total of 168 clinically compatible cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD), including 108 deaths.

The detailed situation report is available as at [11 Apr 2014], describing 159 clinically compatible cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD), including 106 deaths. Laboratory investigations continue at the Institut Pasteur (IP) Dakar laboratory in Conakry (66 samples tested, of which 39 are positive by PCR for ebolavirus) and at the European Union Mobile Laboratory (EMLab) team in Guekedou (55 samples tested/36 positive). A total of 71 clinical cases have been laboratory confirmed (45 percent), while 34 of the remaining clinical cases are classified as probable cases and 54 as suspected cases. Forty-two of the 106 deaths (40 percent) have been laboratory confirmed. Some cases have had repeat testing carried out.

Six districts of Guinea have reported patients - Conakry (31 patients, 22 laboratory confirmed), Guekedou (95 cases/35 confirmed), Macenta (21 cases/12 confirmed), Kissidougou (6 cases/1 confirmed), Dabola (5 cases/1 confirmed) and Djingaraye (1 suspected case). The date of onset of the most recently identified suspected clinical cases in Conakry and Guekedou was [10 Apr 2014]. One additional health care worker (HCW) has been reported, bringing the total to 16 (11 laboratory confirmed and 5 probable cases).

Eleven patients were still hospitalised on [10 Apr 2014] while 37 have been discharged from care. A total 941 contacts have been identified since the beginning of the outbreak. Medical observation is continuing for 396 contacts while 545 have been discharged from follow-up.

Doctors at the Donka Hospital isolation facility in Conakry are investigating a cluster of cases who had funeral contact with a relative who died on [1 Apr 2014] with suspected malaria. Two contacts of this patient were admitted on [12 Apr 2014] and tested positive. One doctor, an internal medicine physician who tested positive on a post mortem sample, had cared for this patient and is also linked to this chain of transmission. He developed an illness with features of EVD but without signs of bleeding. Hospital-based surveillance and triage procedures and infection prevention and control are being strengthened as a result of this cluster. Community sensitization promoting safe burial practices in the community continue.

The distribution of cases and deaths reported today has changed as a result of ongoing data review against the surveillance case definitions in use and the receipt of laboratory results. Numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities and the continuing laboratory investigations.

Liberia
As of [11 Apr 2014], the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has reported a cumulative total of 26 clinical cases of EVD (6 laboratory confirmed, and 20 probable and suspected cases of EVD), including 13 deaths. The most recent clinical case was identified on [11 Apr 2014] while the date of admission of the most recent laboratory confirmed case is [4 Apr 2014]; 3 patients are currently hospitalised while 5 suspected cases that tested PCR negative for ebolavirus have been discharged (4 from Bong County and 1 from Nimba County).

Lofa County accounts for 38 percent of the clinical cases reported to date (4 laboratory confirmed and 6 suspected cases) followed by Margibi County (23 percent, 1 confirmed and 5 suspected cases). Other Counties at risk include Bong (5 suspected cases) and Nimba (3 suspected cases). Montserrado and Grand Cape Mount Counties have each reported one suspected case. At present 35 contacts remain under medical observation and 32 have been released from follow-up. A cumulative number of 13 deaths are being attributed to EVD; Lofa (9), Nimba (1), Margibi (2) and Montserrado (1). All 6 laboratory confirmed cases have died; this includes 3 HCW.

Mali
As of [14 Apr 2014], the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Mali reports a cumulative total of 6 suspected cases, all of whom remain under medical observation (3 in the capital city of Bamako, and 2 in Kouremale and 1 in Bankoumana in the Koulikoro Region. The results of testing on these patients at the Institut Pasteur laboratory in Dakar, Senegal, are expected shortly.

Sierra Leone
There has been no change in the epidemiological situation of EVD in Sierra Leone.

WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, Mali or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.

[4] EU increases immediate health assistance

The European Union is stepping up its efforts to contain the spread of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and assist those affected by the deadly virus. The commission has increased its funding for immediate health operations, experts and risk assessments to 1.1 million Euros [USD 1.5 million] and is contributing medical equipment to help accelerate diagnosis.

"Acting rapidly is crucial. We are reinforcing our support to partner organisations in Guinea and neighbouring countries to ensure urgently needed healthcare to those hit by the epidemic and to stop it from further expanding," said Kristalina Georgieva, EU Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response.

EU Commissioner for Development Andris Piebalgs commented: "The European Commission has been mobilising experts and equipment at short notice to provide quick help on the ground. Good coordination is key in the international response to this outbreak, and this is why we are also setting up a network of EU and African health institutes to exchange know-how in tackling this terrible disease."

Following a commitment of 500 000 Euros [USD 691 000] from last week, the Commission has increased its assistance to help the affected communities in Guinea and neighbouring countries to 1.1 million Euros. These new funds will allow Medecins Sans Frontieres to scale up the on-going interventions in the field of clinical management (such as the isolation of patients and psychosocial support), the tracing of suspected cases, and the training and supply of personal protective equipment for health workers.

Furthermore, the new funds will support the World Health Organization (WHO) in ensuring epidemiological surveillance and providing medical supplies, equipment, transport logistics and health personnel.

Three humanitarian experts from the commission have been sent to Conakry and Monrovia to monitor the situation on the ground and liaise with local authorities and partners. Moreover, on 26 Mar 2014, 6 European specialists of the European Mobile Lab project (EMLab) for dangerous infectious diseases arrived in Gueckedou, Guinea with a mobile laboratory unit. This consists of easily transportable equipment for high security virus manipulation. It will substantially enhance the available capacity for rapid analyses of samples and confirmation of Ebola cases, reducing the number of undiagnosed cases and preventing the further spread of the disease.

The EU is closely following the latest developments with its Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). This has just issued a 2nd Rapid Risk Assessment stating that the risk for EU citizens travelling or living in the affected countries remains "low," and giving a series of recommendations on prevention.

The EMLab project is an initiative funded by the European Commission. It includes partners from Germany, Italy, France, Hungary, Switzerland, Slovenia and the United Kingdom. As part of the international response to the current Ebola outbreak in Guinea, WHO and its Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) requested lab experts of the EMLab project to support the Ministry of Health of Guinea in viral haemorrhagic fever diagnostics. The team of experts is composed of scientists from

- the Bernhard-Nocht-Institute for Tropical Medicine (Germany),
- the Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology (Germany),
- the Istituto Nazionale per le Malattie Infettive L. Spallanzani (Italy) and
- the Laboratoire P4 - INSERM Jean Merieux (France).

They will be joined by 4 experts from Germany, France and Hungary on 15 Apr 2014; another team will take over 4 weeks later.

[5] MSF challenges in Guinea
Date: 12 Apr 2014
Source: Crofsblogs via The Independent [edited]
http://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2014/04/ebola-in-guinea-why-its-tougher-than-ever-to-deal-with.html


I received a message at home in Brussels about this strange disease which had broken out in Guedeckou, in southern Guinea. They thought that perhaps it was Lassa fever, but when I received a description of the patients' symptoms, it was clear to me that we were talking about ebolavirus disease. A couple of days later, I was in Guinea.

I've worked in every major outbreak of ebolavirus disease since 2000. What makes this one different is its geographical spread, which is unprecedented. There are cases in at least 6 towns in Guinea, as well as across the border in Liberia. The problem is that everybody moves around; infected people move from one village to another while they're still well enough to walk; even the dead bodies are moved from place to place. So, as an epidemiologist tracking the disease, it's like doing detective work.

The other problem is that ebolavirus has never been confirmed before in Guinea, so you can be blamed for being the messenger; you're the guy bringing the bad news that the village has been touched by Ebola. To them, it means death, so people often refuse to believe the reality.

We were tracing a patient who we finally found staying with family members in a very small village. He was an educated man, a professor. He'd become infected while caring for a colleague who had caught the disease by caring for his sick uncle; when somebody is sick in Guinea, they are always cared for by people of the same sex.

The professor realised it was probably better for him to come with us to the MSF centre, but his nephew and an elderly female relative suddenly appeared and took the sick patient off into the forest. They had no confidence in the health system and believed that people were killed in our centres, so they decided to keep their relative in the forest and cure him with leaves and herbs.

I followed them into the forest. They were very aggressive; the nephew took a big stick and was hitting the ground, but behind the aggression you could hear the pain in his voice. Eventually, we got a sample from the sick man to make a proper diagnosis. The next day, he asked us to come and collect him.

[7] West Africa
Date: 10 Apr 2014

http://www.utmb.edu/newsroom/article9418.aspx


The death toll from the outbreak of Ebola virus in West Africa has passed 100. Health officials are working to contain the outbreak, which is reported spreading beyond Guinea to Mali, Ghana, and Liberia. It has killed more than 60 percent of those infected.

UTMB's Thomas Geisbert joined Gregory Haertl from the World Health Organization to provide his thoughts and expertise on the situation. As described by Laurie Garrett of the Council on Foreign Relations in an interview on PBS Newshour, the virus produces symptoms that are frightening to witness:

"Ebola is an RNA virus, a very small virus that attacks the endothelial linings that maintain the integrity of your blood vessels, blood veins, [and] capillaries. [Initially], little microscopic holes [open], through which bits of blood and fluids will leak, but eventually, larger and larger holes, until the individual begins to hemorrhage internally, hemorrhaging blood through tears, from the mouth, from the nose, all over the body, so that they become quite frightening to see. And individuals will get a high fever. They may get blood in their brain, which will lead to even more insane behavior, a kind of deranged look in their eyes, all of which contributes to a great deal of fear. On top of it all, the fluids contain virus, so they're highly, highly contagious to the touch."

This is the 1st epidemic of Ebola in West Africa and the worst since 2007. We talked to 2 experts on the disease [UTMB's Thomas Geisbert and WHO's Gregory Haertl] to get a handle on the threat posed by the current outbreak.

"Something's going on in the rain forest, because what these countries share is a special ecology, a special rain forest region, within which are the fruit bats that normally carry the Ebola virus harmlessly to the bat population, but can pass it on to other primates, which can be eaten by the humans, or to people, hunters, that may be in the rain forests. And it's possible that we're getting multiple introductions, or at least more than one, across the region. So if something is going on in the rain forest, that is why the bats are stressed and passing the virus, and then we will see multiple rounds of reintroduction" (Laurie Garrett on Newshour).

Is it time to panic? The answer from health workers responding to an Ebola outbreak in West Africa that began last month [March 2014] is a qualified "no." Transmission requires such close contact that the chance of a widespread epidemic is unlikely. ... Residents of the Mali capital of Bamako took to the streets in anger over reports that several people suspected of having the disease were being held in isolation in their neighborhood. Anger also flared in southern Guinea, where people attacked a health center that was treating patients with Ebola. Senegal has closed its border with Guinea. Morocco has stepped up border controls, and France is asking doctors and hospitals to be on alert for signs of the disease (USA Today).
