China: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 10
-------------------------------------------------
As of Fri 21 Apr 2006, the Ministry of Health in China has informed
WHO of the country's 12th death from H5N1 avian influenza. The death
occurred in a previously reported case, a 21-year-old man from Hubei
Province. He died of severe respiratory disease on 19 Apr 2006.
Of the 17 laboratory-confirmed cases in China, 12 have been fatal.

Egypt: Avian influenza Situation - WHO Update 5
---------------------------------------------
As of Fri 21 Apr 2006, the Ministry of Health in Egypt has informed
WHO of the country's 4th death from H5N1 avian influenza. The death
occurred in a previously announced patient, an 18-year-old girl from
the northern governorate of Minufiyah. She developed symptoms on 5
Apr and died on 14 Apr 2006.
The Ministry of Health regards cases as confirmed when positive
results are obtained in 2 laboratories: the country's national public
health laboratory and the Cairo-based US Naval Medical Research Unit
3 (NAMRU-3). Test results on the country's initial cases have been
fully validated by a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United
Kingdom. All cases confirmed by the Ministry of Health are now listed
in the WHO cumulative table of laboratory-confirmed cases.
Of the 12 cases in Egypt, 4 patients have died and one remains
hospitalized in stable condition; the 7 other patients have fully
recovered and been discharged from hospital.

[3] Special Issue of Science

[The Fri 21 issues of the journal "Science" is a special issue
devoted to the subject of Avian Influenza. The Introduction, entitled
"Influenza: The State of Our Ignorance" by Caroline Ash and Leslie
Roberts, is reproduced here for the benefit of readers of ProMED-mail
together with a list of related sources recently published in
Science. - Mod.CP]

Influenza: The State of Our Ignorance
-------------------------------------
The startling spread of H5N1 across much of the globe highlights our
vulnerability to the emergence of novel subtypes of influenza virus.
Yet despite our fears of pandemic human disease, H5N1 is primarily a]
disease of birds. Olsen and colleagues outline the unseen network of
influenza among migratory birds that spans Earth. H5N1 has engendered
alarm not only because it is unusually virulent, laying waste to
poultry and causing severe economic losses for farmers, but also
because it can, with some difficulty, infect humans and other mammals.
So far, the virus has killed more than half of the nearly 200 people
known to have been infected. Kuiken and colleagues explore the routes
through the obstacles to inter-species transmission (the host species
barrier) of viruses. Their analysis focuses on which adaptations are
needed to facilitate bird-to-human transfer of H5N1. Examples are
provided by Shinya (K. Shinya, Nature 440, 435 (2006) and in a Brevia
by van Riel et al. These authors show that the virus preferentially
binds to cell types bearing specific surface receptors found deep in
the lungs, which may partly explain its poor human-to-human transmissibility.
The combination of ever-unfolding modes of variability and
symptomless transmission makes identification of the virus slow and
hinders the implementation of influenza containment. As Lu outlines
in his Editorial, we urgently need faster and more robust diagnostic
tests for field use (an area we will be covering shortly in Science).
Further articles in this special section describe other tools and
approaches for preparedness. Smith summarizes the models that have
been developed for tracing the rate and spread of pandemic influenza
through human populations, including scenarios for the deployment of
drugs and development of vaccines. We might be able to buy some time
for vaccine manufacture by stockpiling antiviral drugs for immediate
use, but that time may be short. Regoes and Bonhoeffer indicate that
the generation and transmission of resistant strains could happen
quickly. Unfortunately, our knowledge of influenza transmission is
incomplete, and more basic data are needed to make models accurate
and to give them predictive weight. Seasonal influenza statistics
will provide an important insight into the transmission biology of
influenza; Viboud et al. have used a large data set from the United
States to model annual waves of infection.
In a News story, Kaiser explores efforts to develop broader influenza
vaccines that protect against new strains and perhaps even all
influenza subtypes. Antiviral drugs are also sorely needed to fight a
pandemic, but oseltamivir, or Tamiflu, has been in short supply. As
Enserink describes, Roche and other companies are now ramping up
production, while scientists are investigating faster and cheaper
synthetic pathways that could make the drug affordable to developing
countries. In an accompanying podcast, Wills interviews some of the
contributing authors and journalists.
An energetic response to H5N1 does not have to be alarmist. We can
marshal existing concern about this particular strain of avian
influenza to build a long-lasting international infrastructure to
monitor and thwart threats from such emerging infections.
