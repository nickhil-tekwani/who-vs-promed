Pennsylvania-based Protica Inc. is voluntarily recalling 4 protein products on fears they may be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_. The products being recalled include: Body Choice "Protein Shots," Nutritional Resources "Protein Wave," ProBalance "Protein to Go French Vanilla Latte", and "Protein to Go Milk Chocolate Shake."

Consumers can access details of the product Lots being recalled from the FDA website [http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm316820.htm].

The problem was discovered during investigation of the processing parameters for all manufactured products. The affected products were distributed nationally through retail and direct mail.

No illnesses have been confirmed to date. Consumers are warned not to use the product even if it does not look or smell spoiled.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _C. botulinum_. - Mod.LL
