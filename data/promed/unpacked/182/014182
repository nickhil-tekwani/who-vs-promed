Cholera in Pohnpei
--------------------
May 11, 2000
The Federated States of Micronesia has an outbreak of cholera (_Vibrio
cholerae_ serotype Ogawa). The Public Health Laboratory on Guam confirmed
this outbreak on 8 May 2000. The primary symptom is an acute onset of
watery diarrhea with intermittent vomiting and dehydration. There have been
no fatalities.
To date, 36 cases have been admitted to the Pohnpei State Hospital. The
first case was admitted on 17 Apr 2000, the second on 19 Apr, 5 cases on 1
May and since then, the daily admissions have fluctuated between one to 6
cases. Of the 36 patients admitted to the hospital, only three (ages 2, 4,
13 years) were under the age of 15 years. The age range is from 2 to 81
years of age.
The Outpatient Department and Emergency Room have a background of 2 or 3
patients with diarrhea per day. For the past week, the count of patients
with diarrhea, not severe enough to require admission, has varied from a
low of 6 (5 May) to a peak of 16 (10 May).
The outbreak is limited to the island of Pohnpei with a strong focus in
Kitti Municipality. The rural dispensaries in the other municipalities have
not experienced an increase in diarrhea despite increased surveillance
activities.
The Governor has declared a public health emergency and on the advice of
his task force has instituted the following measures to prevent further
spread of cholera. All schools have been closed, all travel to the outer
islands curtailed, and all sakau bars closed until further notice.
