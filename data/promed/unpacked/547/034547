RABIES, HUMAN
Dr. Woodall's comments are well taken but the last report on incidence of
rabies in India came from S. Seggal from the WHO collaborating center at
Delhi. She reports 30,000 human cases per year and at least 500,000
post-exposure treatment cases. My other informants (such respected rabies
experts in India as Drs. Dutta and Dutta former superindendent of Infectious
Diseases Hospital at delhi) have confirmed these numbers.

Human rabies cases in Africa are NOT KNOWN. WHO reports them but is well
aware of the fact that only a minority are actually listed. I know a
missionary doctor who worked in a small hospital in East Africa who, within
two years, looked after at least one dozen human rabies cases. The disease
is underreported in virtually all of the developing world.
WHO stated at the March 1997 "Travel Medicine Congress" at Geneva (Dr. K.
Stohr) that in Asia only Malaysia, Singapore, China and Thailand have been
able to reduce human death rates from rabies (to zero in Singapore).
I do not think that even a totally rabies inexperienced, developed country,
doctor would confuse serum sickness with rabies (Dr. Frank's comments). Look
in the excellent chapter on rabies in Mandel's Textbook of Infectious
Diseases written by D. Fischbein from CDC for clinical details.
Survivals from rabies in humans have been reported but very few. The last
ones came from Mexico and all ended up as virtual vegetables. Where did the
report of rabies survivors come from in India? We have missed them even
though we try to follow the Indian literature as well as possible.
