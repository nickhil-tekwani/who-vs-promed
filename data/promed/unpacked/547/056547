[With the addition of the 8 newly confirmed MERS-CoV infected individuals and 5 deaths in the past 2 days, 537 laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infected cases, including 173 deaths, have now been reported by Saudi Arabia. Of these 8 cases, 4 were classified as in stable condition, 3 were asymptomatic, and one is under intensive care treatment. Of note, 5 of the 8 newly confirmed cases had a history of contact with known MERS-CoV infected individuals.

Beginning on 15 May 2014, information on recent deaths included dates of original reporting of the case, permitting a "look backwards" to see what the condition of the individual was at the time of MERS-CoV infection confirmation. Since then, 16 deaths have been reported. Of these 16 individuals, 10 were reported to be receiving intensive care treatment at the time of diagnosis, 2 were confirmed as MERS-CoV infected around the time of the report of the death, 3 were reported as in stable condition (one of whom was treated in an emergency room and went home for home isolation) and one was reported as asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis of the infection. Hence, 4 (25 per cent) did not present with severe disease at the time when MERS-CoV infection was diagnosed. This information should be interpreted with caution, as it is based on a very small number of the reported deaths (16 out of 173 reported deaths, or 9 per cent).
