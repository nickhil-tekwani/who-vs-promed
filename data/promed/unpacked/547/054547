Since July 2017, Brazilian health authorities have reported 545 confirmed yellow fever cases and 164 deaths.

In January [2018], the Netherlands reported an imported yellow fever case in the country in a traveler to Brazil. The patient, who has since recovered, was a 46 year old unvaccinated man who traveled to and stayed in Maripora, SÃ£o Paulo state, Brazil since mid-December [2017] and was confirmed positive for yellow fever upon return to the Netherlands on 8 Jan [2018] (see PRO/AH/EDR> Yellow fever - Netherlands: ex Brazil (SP) 20180115.5561671).

Both Argentina and France have reported imported yellow fever cases in travelers to Brazil in recent weeks.

According to a G1 Globo report (https://g1.globo.com/bemestar/noticia/argentina-confirma-2-casos-de-febre-amarela-importados-do-brasil.ghtml, in Portuguese), a woman and a 28 year old man from Buenos Aires, Argentina were confirmed positive for yellow fever. The 2 contracted the disease in Brazil, on Ilha Grande in Rio de Janeiro province.

In addition, The French Ministry of Health confirmed a yellow fever case in an unvaccinated woman who traveled through Minas Gerais recently [date in 2018 not specified], according to an em.com report (https://www.em.com.br/app/noticia/gerais/2018/02/16/interna_gerais,938330/francesa-que-viajou-por-minas-gerais-e-diagnosticada-com-febre-amarela.shtml, in Portuguese).

In January 2018, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated their travel notice for Brazil and yellow fever, which contains a link to a list of all cities in Brazil for which yellow fever vaccination has been recommended since before the recent outbreaks.

[The 1st case from Argentina was the unvaccinated 28 year old man from Buenos Aires, who traveled to Brazil from 31 Jan to 15 Feb 2018, and the other was a 45 year old unvaccinated woman who was in Brazil from 29 Jan to 10 Feb 2018. Both individuals were on Ilha Grande and in Ilhabela, areas considered to be yellow fever risks (https://g1.globo.com/bemestar/noticia/argentina-confirma-2-casos-de-febre-amarela-importados-do-brasil.ghtml, in Portuguese).

The above report illustrates why yellow fever is so dangerous due to viremic individuals who travel internationally to distant destinations. The infected individuals who traveled to the Netherlands and France did not pose a risk for starting ongoing transmission because _Aedes aegypti_ vector mosquitoes are not present there, and other mosquitoes were not active during the winter. These vector mosquitoes are present in Argentina and active during the summer season. Fortunately, there was no ongoing transmission there, either. Local and international health authorities state that individuals planning to travel to the areas of yellow fever risk should receive the vaccine at least 10 days prior to travel.
