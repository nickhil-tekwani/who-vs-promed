[During 2012, South Africa reported to the OIE 2 foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) events, both caused by FMDV SAT2 strain in Mpumalanga province. The 1st event started on 9 Jan 2012, involved 2 outbreaks and was declared resolved on 27 Jul 2012. The 2nd one started on 24 Apr 2012, involved 5 outbreaks and was declared resolved on 5 Jul 2012. The current event is caused by a different strain, namely SAT1, similarly regarded endemic in wildlife (mainly African buffaloes).

On 25 Feb 2013, the South African government published the following press release:

"In September 2012, the South African Veterinary Services applied to the World Organisation of Animal Health (OIE) for official recognition of a FMD-free zone without vaccination. Following the meeting of the Scientific Commission of the OIE in February 2013, the commission concluded that the proposed FMD-free zone in South Africa does not fulfil the relevant international requirements as defined in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the OIE.

The main concerns raised by the OIE include aspects of the application including the consistency of the area defined as free, the test used for the surveillance, and the vaccine used in the handling of the outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal. The department is attending to the questions.

The South African Veterinary Services is requesting further details from the OIE and will consider all the feedback in detail, in order to address all the issues raised." (http://allafrica.com/stories/201302260126.html)

According to OIE's updated information (May 2013), South Africa's status as "FMD free zone where vaccination is not practiced," recognised by the OIE World Assembly of Delegates in terms of Resolution XX in May 2005, has been suspended effective 25 Feb 2011. The suspension was applied following a report received from the OIE Delegate of South Africa on outbreaks of FMD in the districts Jozini and Umhlabuyalingana (province of KwaZulu-Natal). An updated OIE map, addressing the official current (May 2013) FMD status of the member countries of Southern Africa (Botswana, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Namibia, Reunion, South Africa and Swaziland) is accessible at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/js/images/fmd/FMD_SouthernAfrica_ENG.gif.
