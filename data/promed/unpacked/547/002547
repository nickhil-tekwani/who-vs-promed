-------
Ebola will spread if resources are not brought to bear
- Quick action to stop the outbreak is a global necessity

Acting swiftly and decisively to extinguish the Ebola outbreak in Uganda is an important priority not just for Uganda, but for Africa and the world. The current outbreak has, thus far, been confirmed to have killed 10 -- including 4 healthcare workers -- and while over 40 cases have been confirmed, none have been outside of Uganda where several districts are reporting cases. However, there is a strong possibility that it will spread to other countries. If resources are not brought to bear, that spread is likely to be an eventuality.

The outbreak's origin

Uganda is a nation that has faced a half dozen prior outbreaks of Ebola. Accordingly, the virus is not an unknown entity there. This current outbreak was declared in September 2022 with the confirmation of a fatal case in a 24-year-old male. This was unlikely to be the 1st case as unexplained deaths had been reported in the 1st weeks of September. It is unknown precisely how this outbreak started and exactly when it began, though it is likely to have been a few weeks prior to the 1st confirmed case, as clinical misdiagnosis of Ebola as typhoid, meningitis, malaria, and other infectious diseases can occur.

The Sudan strain

Complicating this outbreak is the fact that of the 6 species of Ebola that have been described, the Ugandan outbreak is caused by the Sudan strain. This strain, which is highly lethal, is one which has not been involved in human outbreaks since 2012 and is often overshadowed by the more prolific Zaire strain. The Zaire strain was responsible for the massive 2013-2014 West African outbreak and, not coincidentally, is the strain for which vaccines and monoclonal antibodies are available. Unfortunately, countermeasures for one Ebola strain do not have an impact on others. The exact animal reservoir of the Sudan strain and why and how it emerges have not yet been established. It is assumed to be harbored by bats, like other strains of Ebola.

On-the-ground needs

Despite Uganda's past Ebola experiences, it is clear from the pleas of health leaders in the country that they are unable to effectively combat the virus. Coupled with this are concerns about testing capacity, personal protective equipment, economic concerns of physicians, and the need for investigational vaccine trials to commence. This last point is an important lesson to carry forward from 2013-2014: successful vaccine trials that demonstrate efficacy of candidate vaccines in development can be conducted in the midst of an outbreak. There are currently 2 Sudan Ebola vaccine candidates poised to be tested. The leading candidate, developed by The Sabin Institute, exists in a small ready-to-use supply (though more is available in bulk form). Monoclonal antibody development is also being funded. It is important to emphasize that simple measures, such as intravenous fluid and electrolyte replacement, can have considerable impacts on mortality rates, if these minimal resources needed to provide such supportive care are in place.

A ministerial level meeting is being convened next week by the World Health Organization and the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition to providing material resources, it will be critical for the health authorities to gain the trust of the population they're advising, as mistrust of simple health messages -- such as safe burial practices -- can foster the spread of the virus (as occurred in West Africa in 2014). Battling misinformation such as allegations of witchcraft are, unfortunately, necessary.

Meeting the challenge

It is critical for the world to recognize that, just as in 2013-2014, the longer an Ebola outbreak is left to fester in one geographic region, the more likely an imported case becomes. As the US painfully learned from the panic and chaos that ensued in Dallas with the initial misdiagnosis and death of [TED] and the transmission of the virus to 2 healthcare workers, it is much better to fight and contain Ebola at its source than deal with imported cases and the cascading melee they prompt in various countries around the world. Travel screening of those traveling from Uganda has already been initiated in the US, but a much more impactful action would be augmenting testing, contact tracing, public health messaging, and treatment capacity in those regions of Uganda with cases.

Ebola is a deadly, scary disease but one that is not very contagious. It does not possess pandemic potential, as it is spread through blood and body fluids, delimiting the efficiency of its transmission. Nevertheless, as was seen in 2013-2014, chains of transmission can be very long, and the death and destruction it can cause is sizable. It can be stopped in its tracks if resources are brought to bear.

In the wake of COVID-19, it takes a high degree of evasion to not recognize the need for competent and well-resourced responses to infectious disease threats as they appear.

[2] Quarantine vs isolation
Date: Sat 8 Oct 2022

https://evidenceaid.org/the-quarantine-conundrum-perspectives-for-the-humanitarian-community/


Humanitarian aid workers may be activated to respond to emerging infectious disease (EID) crises such as the Ebola outbreak in West Africa declared by the World Health Organization to be a public health emergency of international concern in August 2014. Sometimes these heroes are functioning in their full-time positions, but more commonly they are volunteers who temporarily separate themselves from their regular duties and their families. The question of whether it is really necessary to mandate a quarantine after completion of the mission and before returning home is therefore of critical importance and needs scientific evidence.

Using Ebola as an example, mixed messages and inconsistent policies prevailed during the height of the outbreak. This stemmed in part from misapplications of the terms "quarantine" and "isolation." While both represent public health tools that involve physical separation and confinement of individuals to prevent disease transmission and protect the public health, there are important differences. Quarantine is used for healthy (asymptomatic) individuals after exposure to a contagious disease, if and only if there is potential to transmit the disease. Conversely, isolation is applied to infected (symptomatic) people, also with the goal to prevent disease transmission.

In the case of Ebola, many asymptomatic humanitarian aid workers were "quarantined" after caring for patients in West Africa, thus keeping them away from their routine work and their families for an additional 21 days after completing their service abroad. Since science tells us that Ebola is not contagious from person to person prior to symptom onset, there was no potential for these healthcare workers to transmit disease (13). This mandated quarantine of asymptomatic health-care workers was not founded in evidence.

Despite this, some politicians and public health decision-makers argued that it was safer to quarantine "just in case" and "out of an abundance of caution" (12). Yet this approach is fraught with unintended consequences. In addition to the obvious infringement of civil liberties, the policy inhibits healthcare workers from traveling to West Africa to eradicate the disease at its source; discourages them from caring for Ebola patients within their own countries; and exacerbates existing shortages by removing caregivers from work for an additional 21 days.

Within the United States alone, inconsistences in application of policy included some states mandating quarantine for returning health-care workers, and the military requiring quarantine, while there was free movement for the United Nations Ambassador returning from West Africa and for physicians and nurses caring for Ebola patients within the United States. To address these discrepancies, the American College of Emergency Physicians, Ebola Expert Panel, developed policy in support of statements by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, and the World Health Organization to "oppose mandatory quarantine of asymptomatic health-care workers who have treated Ebola patients in the US or have returned from caring for patients overseas in Ebola-affected areas" (9).

Furthermore, to inform policy makers and mitigate this conundrum, Barbisch and Koenig developed a novel "quarantine and isolation decision tool" [https://evidenceaid.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Kristi-Quarantine-algorithm.pdf]. This tool considers disease characteristics, including whether the infection is contagious prior to symptom onset, to form an evidence base for policy decisions. In summary, the application of quarantine for ill-informed reasons must be avoided, and we need to advocate for scientifically based principles to guide quarantine policy so that we are prepared to contain the next EID, whatever nature or a nefarious entity throws our way!

[See references at URL above and look at the very reasonable and science-based "quarantine and isolation decision tool" from 2014. It removes fear and political factors from decision-making in cases of infectious diseases that pose a substantial public health threat, which is the best policy, albeit difficult for the governmental bodies making the rules. The more we can separate politics from scientific decision-making, the more effective public health will be.

Per the source article, "Prof. Dr. Kristi L. Koenig is a professor emerita of emergency medicine & public health, University of California, Irvine, USA. Professor Koenig, an internationally recognized expert in disaster medicine, emerging infectious diseases, surge capacity, and crisis care, is founding director of the UC Irvine Center for Disaster Medical Sciences.

[3] Global response
Date: Sun 9 Oct 2022

If there's one thing we've learned from COVID-19 and monkeypox, health experts say, it's that viruses are world travellers, and disease outbreaks are developing at a fast and furious pace.

Now, as Uganda fights an Ebola outbreak, doctors are urging rich countries like Canada to pay attention.

"We know from past outbreaks that preparedness is key and that a disease can spread anywhere rapidly," Dr. Patrick Otim, who is leading the World Health Organization's (WHO) Ebola response in Uganda, told CBC News in an email. "Global solidarity when it comes to sharing resources, supplies and expertise can be the difference between a localized public health threat and a global one."

Authorities declared an outbreak of Ebola virus on 20 Sep [2022]. The disease is devastating, with death rates ranging from 25-90% in past outbreaks in Africa. Although the root of this specific outbreak hasn't yet been confirmed, Ebola is often thought to originate in fruit bats and then infects other wild animals.

Humans initially become infected through contact with animals, including when hunting for bushmeat. Then, it spreads between humans through direct contact with bodily fluids, including blood, vomit, feces, saliva, or semen. Without proper personal protective equipment, people can become infected while caring for an Ebola patient, handling their bedsheets, or burying the body of someone who has died from the virus.

Right now, there are dozens of confirmed cases across Uganda, and the disease has killed at least 4 health-care workers, according to the WHO. Health authorities are not only trying to save patients' lives, they're also trying to prevent the virus from spreading to neighbouring African countries. Both are tough feats, given there is not yet a licensed vaccine for this particular kind of Ebola -- known as the Sudan strain -- nor a drug treatment beyond keeping patients hydrated and managing symptoms.

There's reason for hope, though.

Ugandan and international scientists are planning to test a vaccine candidate, developed by the Sabin Vaccine Institute and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US, that has shown promise against the Sudan strain in early-stage trials, said Dr. Yonas Tegegn Woldemariam, WHO representative to Uganda, in a media briefing Thursday [6 Oct 2022]. The hope is that it will be as successful as the Ervebo vaccine has been against the type of Ebola known as the Zaire strain, which drove many previous outbreaks.

Battling Ebola requires a lot of resources -- from personal protective equipment to test kits to expertise -- so it's critical that more prosperous countries support Uganda's medical response now to save lives and money, said Dr. Boghuma Kabisen Titanji, an infectious diseases specialist at Emory University in Atlanta.

"You need to make the investment early on to squash an outbreak and not wait for it to affect the US or have a case imported into Europe to then raise the level of alarm," she said.

Taking a global approach to health care and providing necessary medical and humanitarian assistance quickly is the best way for Canadians to defend against Ebola and other disease outbreaks, agreed Dr. Joanne Liu, a professor at the School of Population and Global Health at McGill University and former international president of Doctors Without Borders.

"If you want to beat an outbreak and avoid an outbreak ... [moving] to an epidemic to a pandemic, your response needs to move faster than the virus," Liu said. "So we cannot wait."

Thousands of people died in a widespread West African outbreak of the Zaire Ebola strain between 2014 and 2016, but there was no sense of urgency from rich countries until it hit close to home, Titanji said.

"I mean we had had vaccine candidates for Ebola [Zaire strain] that were sitting on shelves for 10 years, just lacking the investment in research," she said. "It was only when we started seeing importation of cases to European countries and to the US that we had a heightened sense of 'this is now a public health emergency of international concern.'"

During that previous outbreak, there were 4 cases of Ebola in the US, including one death, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). There were no known cases in Canada.

Although the risk of getting Ebola in Canada or the US is low, even one case is "a house on fire situation," said Dr. Syra Madad, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Harvard Kennedy Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. Ebola's high fatality rate and the intensity of care required make it a "low probability but high consequence" disease, she said.

The CDC recognized those stakes on Thursday [6 Oct 2022], issuing a precautionary health advisory asking health-care providers in the US to take a travel history of patients with common initial symptoms of Ebola, "including fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, gastrointestinal symptoms, and unexplained bleeding."

The US administration took precautions a step further, announcing that passengers who have travelled to Uganda would be screened for Ebola in 5 airport hubs.

There's no indication that Canada will be doing similar passenger screening, although on Friday [7 Oct 2022] the Public Health Agency of Canada issued a travel notice recommending that travellers take extra precautions when visiting Uganda.

A spokesperson for the agency said in an email to CBC News that it "is monitoring the situation globally and will continue to assess the risk to Canadians as new information becomes available," noting that Ebola is "not spread through casual contact."

"The Government of Canada has systems in place to identify and help prevent spread of serious infectious diseases in Canada," the email said. "We remain prepared to detect, investigate, and manage cases of Ebola in the unlikely event that a case arrives in Canada."

If you feel like there's one health emergency after another these days, experts say that's no coincidence.

"The phenomenon of outbreaks becoming potentially epidemic and pandemic is happening over and over again," said Liu. "If we go from SARS in 2003 to COVID-19 in 2020 to Ebola today, it's just like each time the lapse of time between those events is shorter."

International travel is a factor, but a major culprit is climate change, doctors say.

Pressures that we put on the environment, such as clearing forests, affect the animals who carry viruses, which increasingly causes "spillover" to humans, Liu said.

"Viruses and infectious pathogens do not care how exhausted we are by these outbreaks," Titanji said. "The collision between climate change, increased population movement, increased interaction with animals and our environment ... increases the potential that we will see more outbreaks of infectious diseases."

[This is such an important perspective piece that gets to the heart of emerging infectious diseases. It pertains not only to Ebola, but also monkeypox and COVID, and "disease X," the unknown next public health threat that we know will come. Climate change is at the bottom of the problem, with speed and frequency of international travel contributing factors, as well as lack of stable food resources. It is important that the need for global support to fight emerging pathogens is heeded. - Mod.LK
