The number of reported cases of Lyme disease, an infection transmitted by
the bite of deer ticks (properly called "black-legged ticks"), has doubled
in Vermont in the past 2 years. Data from the Vermont Department of Health
show that in 2005, 29 Vermonters contracted Lyme disease from Vermont
ticks. In 2006, the number rose to 62. So far this year [2007], 71 cases of
Lyme disease in humans have been reported. The highest concentration of
cases are in the southern part of the state -- 25 in Bennington County and
13 in Windham County, 6 in Addison, Chittenden and Rutland counties, 5 in
Windsor, 2 in Franklin, Lamoille, Orleans and Washington counties and one
in Caledonia and Orange counties -- and the tick season isn't over yet.
The only counties without reported cases of Lyme disease are Essex and
Grand Isle. But that doesn't mean Lyme disease doesn't exist there, nor
does it mean that the people with reported cases of Lyme disease got it in
the counties where they live. The state tracks cases by county of
residence. That means someone who lives in Franklin County could have been
infected on a visit to Grand Isle County, even though Grand Isle has no
reported cases. In fact, Grand Isle County is known to have ticks infected
with the Lyme bacterium. In a 2004 study, nearly half (49 per cent) of the
ticks collected there tested positive for the organism. In past years, the
Department of Health has collaborated with the Department of Agriculture,
the Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation and with private
veterinarians in several tick surveillance projects. In one study,
veterinarians reported the percentage of dogs they treated that had Lyme
antibodies. In another, 2 veterinarians from each county sent ticks they
removed from cats and dogs to the Department of Forests, Parks and
Recreation, where an entomologist categorized them according to species and
life stage. But Tassler noted, "That's not really a statistically
representative sample."
A similar study involved collecting ticks from deer shot during the opening
week of rifle season by combing their front ends at check stations and
identifying the ticks by species and life-cycle stage. But, Tassler noted,
"We haven't really been able to test those ticks for Lyme disease. "We have
a little bit of data on what species of ticks exist in Vermont, but we have
very little data on what proportion of those ticks are actually carrying
Lyme. We don't have any funding or budget for Lyme work, so it's just as
resources are available." The surveillance projects have been discontinued.
"The entomologist from Forest, Parks and Recreation who was cataloging the
ticks just had too many other priorities, and since the tick identification
wasn't really in her job description, she wasn't able to continue doing it.
Unfortunately, we just don't have a lot of resources in state government
for doing Lyme work," Tassler explained. Little can be done to halt the
spread of ticks.
Tassler said: Ticks travel on wildlife and birds, and the Champlain Valley
and Connecticut River Valley are avian flyways. The peak season for the
onset of the disease in Vermont mirrors the peak season nationally - June
through August. "That's because that time of year is when the nymphal stage
ticks are active," Tassler said. "And because they're so small and hard to
see, people get tick bites and don't even ever realize the tick is there.
The tick is allowed to feed for more than 24 hours which lets it transmit
Lyme disease." (Ticks that are attached for less than 24 hours don't have
time to transmit the disease.) Deer tick activity peaks again in October
and November, but by then most of the ticks are adults, and larger. "People
tend to see them and remove them promptly, and that's why there aren't a
lot of human cases that time of year," Tassler said. "The vast majority of
human cases of Lyme disease are caused by the nymphal-stage ticks." Ticks
are active at any temperature above 40 degrees. That means they are active
in the fall until there have been a few hard frosts and in the early spring
as soon as the temperature gets above freezing. "Ticks can be active even
when there's still snow on the ground," Tassler said.
The best defense against Lyme disease is taking steps to prevent infection,
Tassler argued, and a key to prevention is doing a full body tick check
every day. People who don't have a partner to check places like their back
should use a mirror. "Once a tick gets on your body or skin, it will move
around until it finds a warm, moist place to attach even if it was covered
up when you were outside," she said. The Department of Health hopes to
distribute plastic cards that people can hang in their showers to remind
them to do daily tick checks, Tassler said. "Even with all the other
prevention measures that people can take, like insect repellent and tucking
their pants into their socks, you still can't always prevent all the ticks
from getting onto you. So if you do a daily tick check and remove any ticks
promptly before they've been attached for more than a day, you really are
dramatically cutting back the chances of acquiring Lyme disease. Daily tick
checks really can work," she declared.

[Lyme disease is distributed focally within the United States. The top 10
per cent of counties reported account for about 93 per cent of cases for
which county of residence is known. These counties are located mainly in 8
north eastern states (Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New
Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island). Cases are reported by
county of residence, which is assumed to be the county of exposure. But
people are often exposed to infected ticks outside their county of residence.
As indicated in the above news release, Lyme disease peaks in the summer
months of June, July and August, which correspond with the seasonal feeding
activity of nymphal _Ixodes scapularis_ in the north eastern United States.
Because the attached nymph is about the size of a poppy seed, it might not
be noticed and, therefore, not removed before disease transmission occurs.
Cases occurring later in the season -- for example, in August and
September, occur when the adult form feeds.
Passive tick surveillance, using ticks submitted by the public for Lyme
spirochete testing, has been used to assess the geographical distribution
of Lyme disease risk, as has the use of dogs as sentinel animals for
serology testing to characterize the risk of _B. burgdorferi_ transmission
to humans in a defined geographical location.
