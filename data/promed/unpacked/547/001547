New strain of scrapie hits sheep industry
-----------------------------------------
The sheep industry was set on edge yesterday following an announcement by
the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [DEFRA] in London
that tests had detected a new strain of scrapie, the fatal brain disease of
sheep associated with BSE in cattle and, by implication, variant CJD in the
human population.
Senior officials with both DEFRA and the Scottish Executive's environment
and rural affairs department were at pains to stress, however, that the
discovery is not linked to BSE and that there is no need for consumer
concerns over food safety.
What is of major concern is that the government-funded Veterinary
Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, Surrey, has confirmed that 83 "atypical"
cases of scrapie have been found over the past 3 years in samples from 110
000 sheep brains tested. More worrying is the acknowledgement that of those
83 abnormal results, 12 have been found in sheep with the genotype normally
associated with the highest degree of resistance to scrapie.
A statement from DEFRA confirmed that the National Scrapie Plan, which aims
to rid the UK sheep flock of 37 million of the disease, will continue in
its current form.
The UK, with the largest sheep flock in the European Union, is ahead of all
other member states -- with the exception of the Netherlands -- in
achieving its goal of scrapie-free status within a decade.
3 years ago the UK government and the devolved administrations drew up a
contingency plan that, in the event of a proven link between scrapie and
BSE, virtually every sheep would be slaughtered. That plan, in time, proved
to be based on a seriously flawed scientific assessment.
The UK is obliged, under direction from the European Commission, to conduct
brain tests each year on 10 000 sheep over 18 months of age which are
processed in abattoirs, as well as a similar total which die on farms.
Results have shown that only 0.3 per cent of these sheep have been infected
with scrapie, with many devoid of clinical symptoms.
But it has been almost impossible to trace back the 83 "atypical" cases
back to the farm of origin. This has prompted fears that the commission
will insist the UK puts in place an individual identification scheme for
sheep. This has been resisted by the UK on the grounds that no other member
state runs sheep on an extensive regime such as in the Highlands and in the
Welsh mountains, where stocking rates are very low. Tagging every lamb at
birth and recording maternal details would be impossible.
A spokesperson for National Farmers Union (NFU) Scotland expressed support
for the National Scrapie Plan (NSP). "We knew that abnormal cases could be
thrown up, given the scale of the testing regime which promotes the most
resistant genotypes. These will not be guaranteed as totally resistant, but
they represent the best options for producers."

Department confirms new strain of scrapie in sheep
--------------------------------------------------
The Department of Agriculture has confirmed that a new strain of scrapie is
emerging in Irish sheep. The disease is a fatal, degenerative illness
affecting the central nervous system of sheep and goats and [like] BSE in
cattle and CJD in humans [is caused by a mutated prion protein].
The department's confirmation of the existence of the illness in Ireland
came just hours after the British authorities said that 80 cases of an
unknown strain of scrapie had been found in sheep there.

[Atypical cases of scrapie have been reported, since 2003, also from
Norway, France, and Switzerland. So far, the scrapie strains involved in
these cases have not been shown to be related to BSE.
Following the recently published findings by a research group in France
that they suspect the presence of a TSE (transmissible spongiform
encephalopathy) infection in a goat's brain which tests cannot distinguish
from BSE, the European Commission submitted data received from the French
authorities to the Community Reference Laboratory (CRL) for TSEs based in
Weybridge, England, for an evaluation by an expert group. The issue was
discussed during the 85th meeting of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory
Committee (SEAC), held in Cardiff on 30 Nov 2004. The committee was
informed that, although the data available are consistent with BSE, a
definitive interpretation could not be provided until further data from
mouse bioassays were available in about 2 months. - Mod.AS]
