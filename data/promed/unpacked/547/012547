Costa Rica Probes Deaths of 500 Pelicans
----------------------------------------
Authorities in Costa Rica said Tuesday [13 Feb 2007] they are
investigating the mysterious deaths over the last 5 days of about 500
brown pelicans along the country's Pacific coast, but [they] do not
suspect bird flu was the cause.
A fisherman spotted the 1st dead birds on Thursday [8 Feb 2007], on
San Lucas Island, about 16 km. (10 miles) from the coastal city of
Puntarenas. More turned up in the following days at nearby islands
and rivers.
"This is a situation that is enormously worrisome," Costa Rican
Environment Minister Roberto Dobles said. "But it is hard to know
what happened, and so it is better not to speculate."
Investigators were collecting tissue samples from the dead birds, but
tests to determine the cause of death may take several days, said
National Animal Health Service spokesman Flor Aguero.
Coast Guard marine biologist Carmen Castro said investigators do not
think the deaths were caused by bird flu, which is primarily spread
by migration.
Brown pelicans are not migratory birds, and form stable, permanent
colonies. They are not considered an endangered or protected species
in Costa Rica .
Health Minister Maria Luisa Avila said that while agriculture and
animal health officials are in charge of the investigation, hospitals
have been checked for possible cases of diseases like West Nile virus
[WNV] that could infect both birds and humans.
Mosquitoes can spread that disease [WNV] by biting infected birds and
then biting humans. Avila said no such cases have been found so far.

[The brown pelican _Pelecanus occidentalis_ is found on the Pacific
coast, the Gulf coast, and the Atlantic coast. They like sandy beach
areas of coastal areas and river areas. They are generally a flock
bird. Although the pelican will eat crustaceans, it is primarily a
diver. It plunges into the deep water scooping up water and fish in
its beak. It prefers fish including mullet, silversides, herring,
mullet and menhaden.
There is not enough information here to understand what else may have
caused the death of the pelicans. Hopefully the investigation will
reveal a more definitive cause.
