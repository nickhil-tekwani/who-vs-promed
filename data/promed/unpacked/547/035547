4000 suspected Chikungunya cases detected nationwide
----------------------------------------------------
The Health Ministry has detected about 4000 suspected chikungunya
cases nationwide this year [2008], Minister Datuk Liow Tiong Lai said
Wednesday [17 Dec 2008]. He said the disease which was 1st detected
in Johor had spread to Negeri Sembilan, Melaka, Perak, Selangor and
the latest Kedah.

"So far, the chikungunya disease is still under control nationwide,"
he told reporters after visiting Sultanah Nur Zahirah Hospital here.
Present was Terengganu Health Director Dr. Nordiyanah Hassan. Liow
said that so far, there is no specific medicine to treat the
chikungunya fever disease spread by _Aedes_ mosquito. "So, I would
like to call on the public to be careful particularly during the wet
season now because _Aedes_ mosquito is easy to breed," he said.

To contain the spread of the disease, he said, the ministry had taken
several measures including intensifying the campaign to rid of
_Aedes_ mosquito and holding lectures on the outbreak. He said the
disease was 1st detected to have spread to Malaysia from Africa in 1997.

Meanwhile, he said 63 health projects costing RM458 million [USD 131
230 211] had been approved for implementation in Terengganu under the
Ninth Malaysia Plan and some had started.
