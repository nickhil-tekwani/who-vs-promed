Recruitment begins for US smallpox vaccine trial
------------------------------------------------
In view of growing concern over threats of bioterrorism, particularly an
outbreak of smallpox, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Disease of the US National Institutes of Health is sponsoring a clinical
trial of the effectiveness of diluting existing smallpox vaccine.
Routine vaccination against smallpox (Variola major), deemed eradicated
worldwide in the 1970s, stopped in the USA in 1972. People immunised before
then are now believed to have little, if any, immunity left. Although the
vaccine has not been manufactured in nearly 20 years, the government is now
seeking enough vaccine to immunise every American. But because new vaccines
are not expected to be available until next year, scientists are
investigating whether the government's stockpile could be diluted for wider
use.
About 15 million doses of the Dryvax vaccine, produced by Wyeth
Laboratories, are on hand. The vaccine, which is made from vaccinia virus,
creates a very mild infection that causes a characteristic scab at the site
of the injection, and results in immunity to smallpox. The trial is
designed to determine whether dilutions of the vaccine and an altered
vaccination strategy can provide effective immunity, such that the existing
supply would be sufficient to deal with an outbreak.
Four sites are involved in the trial: Baylor College of Medicine (Houston,
TX), St Louis University, University of Maryland, and University of
Rochester (NY). A total of 684 adults will be randomly assigned to receive
a full-strength formulation of the vaccine, or a 1 to 5 or 1 to 10
dilution. Participants who do not develop a scab at the injection site or
produce antibodies in the blood 7 to 9 days after vaccination will be
re-vaccinated with the same formulation they received initially. Trial
participants must be healthy adults aged 18-32 years who have not been
vaccinated against smallpox nor had the disease.
John Treanor, an investigator at the University of Rochester, said
recruitment at his site had been somewhat slower than anticipated, perhaps
because volunteers must commit to many study visits. But he expects
enrollment to be concluded by the end of November, with preliminary results
available by the end of the year. He said the vaccine's "take rate",
indicated by the formation of an initial blister at the injection site,
followed by scarring, is highly correlated with the development of
antibodies and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte response. Therefore, the take
rate should give a good indication of the effectiveness of the dilutions.
