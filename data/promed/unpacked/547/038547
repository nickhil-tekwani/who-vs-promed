New York City health officials yesterday, 28 Jun 2006, announced a novel
assault on a large meningitis outbreak in Brooklyn, seeking to vaccinate
thousands of drug users and others in and around Bedford-Stuyvesant against
the bacterium that has sickened 23 people and killed 8 of them.
That group of cases, over the past 7 months, "is one of the largest
outbreaks of meningitis described in the American literature in the last
couple of decades," said health commissioner Thomas R Frieden. And the
department's response, a mass vaccination for meningococcal meningitis, made
possible by a new, more effective vaccine, appears to be the first in the
city's history, he said.
The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene put out a call urging people to
step forward and be vaccinated if they have used crack, heroin, or methadone
in the past 3 months and either live in or have used drugs in the Brooklyn
neighborhoods within the ZIP codes 11206, 11216, 11221, and 11233. Anyone
who lives with those drug users is also encouraged to get the vaccine.
Dr Frieden said the department's twin challenges would be to reach the drug
users who may be at risk, and to prevent panic among the much larger number
of people who are deemed not at risk. "Meningitis evokes such fear in
people," he said, but the city will not give the vaccine -- of which there
is a national shortage -- to people who do not need it.
Dr Frieden said he could not say how many drug users there might be in the
target area of 4 ZIP codes, which was home to 263 000 people when the census
was taken in 2000. "What we do hope is we'll be able to vaccinate at least
several thousand people," he said. People seeking inoculations can contact
drug treatment programs, homeless shelters, needle exchanges, doctors'
offices, and clinics.
All 23 cases in and around Bedford-Stuyvesant were caused by the same strain
of meningococcus bacteria, according to the health department, meaning that
the cases are probably connected. Most of the cases involved drug users, but
officials do not believe drug use played a role in transmission, just that
the patients spent time in physical contact, perhaps in cramped quarters,
with each other or with people who were infected but did not develop
meningitis.
Each year, 1400 to 2800 people nationwide do get sick from meningococcus,
including 30 to 40 cases in New York City, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Among all cases, 11 per cent to 19 per
cent suffer permanent harm like brain damage, deafness, or loss of a limb,
and 10 per cent to 14 per cent die. Most victims recover fully with
antibiotic treatment, especially when the disease is caught early.
The most recent cases in Brooklyn struck earlier in Jun 2006, and drew
widespread attention because there were 3 victims at once, 2 of whom were
related. They lived in the same apartment complex in Bedford-Stuyvesant,
knew each other well, and had attended a party together in that complex a
few days earlier. One patient, a woman in her 40s, died.

[This vaccination program using the quadrivalent (A, C, Y, W135) newer
conjugated vaccine may be difficult given the issues surrounding individuals
at high risk. Protein conjugation of the polysaccharide capsular antigen
makes the vaccine better. The process produces a T cell-dependent antigen,
which allows it to be antigenic in children under 2 years as well as
producing immunologic memory, priming the immune system for subsequent
doses. Conjugation of the _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b (Hib) capsular
antigen has produced a vaccine that has essentially eradicated invasive Hib
disease from areas where it is utilized.
Of note, it has not been stated whether the 3-person cluster (the original
report counted 4 but one of the cases did not have the infection) would have
fallen into the cohort recommended for vaccination.
