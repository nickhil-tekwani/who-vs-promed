9 people, including 5 members of one family, are admitted at the Meru
General Hospital after eating meat suspected to be infected with anthrax.
The people started vomiting and complaining of stomach ailments after
eating uninspected meat in Ngarendare Village in Timau Division, Meru
central District on Friday. Speaking to reporters from their hospital beds,
some of the victims said a villager whose cow died as it was calving down
gave them the meat.
Those admitted at the Meru General hospital include 5 children aged between
one and 10 years who were all rushed to the facility on Sunday, 2 days
after feasting on the beef. A man (45 years old), his wife (43), 2
daughters (27 and 20) and another person (20) were admitted to the same
hospital, while their son was treated and discharged on Sunday. A grandson
was admitted alongside the others.
However, the MOH's Dr Ndegwa Wanjuki said the victims are being treated for
food poisoning but the patients have been put on a dose to counter anthrax
effects. He described their condition as "serious but stable".
The 45-year-old man revealed that he decided to slaughter the cow to save
it from dying after difficulties while giving birth. "The healthy-looking
cow was about to die due to calving down complications and I thought it
posed no health problems requiring a veterinarian to inspect the meat", he
said. Over 20 villagers are said to have carried home portions of the
suspected beef.
In December 2005, the District Public Health Officer Joseph M'Arimi
cautioned residents against eating meat that is not inspected.
