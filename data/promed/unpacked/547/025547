INFLUENZA, EQUINE - SOUTH AFRICA: NOT

[Regarding 2 previous postings from ProMED-mail (Influenza, equine - South
Africa : RFI 20030410.0874 & African horse sickness - South Africa
(02) 20030401.0804)]
This [first] story, taken from a local newspaper, contains a number of
inaccuracies. The disease being reported on was in fact an outbreak of
African horse sickness (AHS) and not influenza; it was caused by AHS virus
type 2, which is not a new strain. The self-imposed movement ban was
sensible, although the vector of AHS is still able to move at will.
South Africa experienced a severe outbreak of A/Equi-2 influenza in 1986
introduced by an imported horse. The virus was isolated (Johannesburg '86),
a monovalent vaccine produced, and vaccination rigorously enforced and
carried out. There has been no clinical or serological evidence of virus
circulation [subsequently], and the compulsory vaccination of horses
attending race meetings or other events has recently been lifted. There is
definitely no new strain of equine flu in the country.
There were also 2 inaccuracies in ProMED-mail's posting
20030401.0804. _Culicoides bolitinos_ breeds in cattle, not in horse dung;
samples from the Underberg outbreak have been sent to the Horse sickness
Reference Laboratory at the Onderstepoort Institute, not to the Equine
Research Centre.

[We thank Dr Gerdes for the authoritative response to our request for
information regarding Equine Influenza in RSA, as well as for the comment
on the previous AHS press posting. Indeed the value of animal movement
restrictions seem to be rather limited when culicoides-borne diseases are
concerned. - Mod.AS]
