Public Health Dispatch: West Nile Virus Infection in Organ Donor and
Transplant Recipients; Georgia and Florida, 2002
-------------------------------------------------
On 23 Aug 2002, the Georgia Division of Public Health (GDPH) and CDC were
notified of 2 cases of unexplained fever and encephalitis in recipients of
organ transplants from a common donor. An investigation has identified
illness in 2 other recipients from the same donor: one with encephalopathy
and the other with febrile illness. CDC, the Food and Drug Administration,
GDPH, and the Florida Department of Health are conducting the
investigation. This cluster could represent the first recognized
transmission of West Nile virus (WNV) by organ donation.
On 1 Aug 2002, 4 organs were recovered from a single donor and subsequently
transplanted into 4 persons. The donor had been previously healthy before a
fatal injury. Before death, the organ donor received numerous transfusions
of blood products. Testing performed at CDC with polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) during this investigation revealed the presence of WNV in donor serum
collected before organ procurement. Of the 4 organ recipients, 3 met the
case definition for WNV encephalitis. Testing is pending on the fourth
recipient.
A recipient of one of the donor kidneys developed a febrile illness 13 days
after transplant which progressed to encephalitis requiring transient
mechanical ventilation; the patient's clinical condition is improving.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was positive for WNV IgM antibody.
A second kidney recipient had a febrile illness 17 days after transplant
progressing to fatal encephalitis. Brain tissues obtained at autopsy were
strongly positive for WNV by quantitative PCR and also were positive by
flavivirus-specific immunohistochemical staining.
A third patient who received a heart transplant had ataxia 8 days following
transplant; the patient later became unresponsive and required mechanical
ventilation. WNV IgM antibody testing of the patient's CSF and serum at the
Florida Department of Health Bureau of Laboratories was strongly positive.
This patient's mental status has improved, and the patient no longer
requires ventilatory support.
A fourth patient who underwent liver transplantation had fever, cough, and
malaise 7 days following transplant; the patient had no clinical evidence
of encephalitis. The patient's symptoms resolved, allowing discharge from
the hospital. Laboratory evaluation of serum for WNV is in progress. WNV
infection in organ transplant recipients has not been reported previously,
and the risk for transmission of WNV through donated organs is not known.
Of the 4 organ recipients, 3 had encephalitis; typically, one in 150 WNV
infections results in encephalitis or meningitis. It is unknown whether
immunosuppressed persons, such as organ transplant recipients, are at
increased risk for severe WNV-related disease following infection.
Similarly, it is unknown if the route of transmission increased the risk
for encephalitis in these organ transplant recipients.
The organ donor might have become infected from a mosquito bite or from
blood products received following the fatal injury. On the basis of
preliminary results from this investigation, clinicians should be aware of
the possibility of WNV infection in organ transplant recipients and
patients receiving blood transfusions. Clinicians who suspect WNV infection
can obtain rapid testing through state and local health departments. Public
health officials have initiated precautionary measures including a
withdrawal and testing of any remaining blood products from blood donors
whose blood product was given to the organ donor. Donors of blood given to
the organ donor and other recipients of blood from these donors are being
contacted for West Nile virus testing.
This is the first report of possible transmission of WNV by organ
transplantation. Current data are insufficient to warrant changes to organ
or blood donor screening and testing practices or the clinical use of
donated organs and blood.

West Nile Virus Confirmed in a 4th Transplant Patient
-----------------------------------------------------
Doctors have confirmed that a woman in Florida is the fourth person to have
contracted West Nile virus after receiving an organ transplanted from a
single donor who had the virus, a federal health official said last night.
Finding the virus in all 4 organ recipients "very strongly suggests" that
the disease was transmitted by the organs rather than by mosquito bites,
said the official, Dr. Lyle Petersen, a West Nile virus expert at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The Florida woman, 71, had a liver transplant at a Jacksonville hospital
and then came down with a mild illness but did not develop encephalitis.
She is recovering at home in Miami. The 3 other transplant patients did
develop encephalitis, and one has died; the 2 others are still hospitalized.
The case has also raised the possibility that the virus was transmitted by
blood transfusions as well as organs. The organ donor, injured in a car
accident, received many transfusions before she died. She was not known to
be ill before the crash, and a preserved sample of her blood, taken before
she had any transfusions, was free of the virus. But further tests are
still needed to find out whether she was infected by the transfusions or by
a mosquito, Dr. Petersen said.
Speaking at a news conference, Dr. Petersen said the CDC had also begun
investigating a second case of possible transmission of West Nile virus by
blood transfusions. In that case, a Mississippian developed a West Nile
infection almost 4 weeks after receiving transfusions, well within the
incubation period for the disease. The patient had also had numerous
mosquito bites, however. Remaining blood products from donors to that
patient have been withdrawn from use. A spokesman for the Mississippi
Health Department said 18 units of blood were involved. Health officials
said they were preparing to contact the donors, as well as other
recipients, to test them for West Nile virus.
But Dr. Petersen and Dr. Jesse Goodman, an official of the Food and Drug
Administration, said that even if the cases were linked to transfusions,
that route of transmission would most likely prove to be extremely rare.
They emphasized that mosquitoes caused nearly all cases of the disease, and
said current screening procedures would help protect the blood supply, by
rejecting people with fever or any other symptoms of viral illness. In
addition, people who are infected with West Nile have the virus in their
blood for only a short time, unlike people with HIV or hepatitis C virus,
who may carry those viruses for life. The officials also said the methods
used to process plasma products, though not whole blood, destroyed many
viruses, probably including West Nile virus.

West Nile Virus Confirmed in 4th Organ Recipient & Mississippi Transfusion
Recipient
--------------------------------------------------
A fourth person who became ill after receiving a donated organ from a
Georgia car crash victim has tested positive for West Nile virus, strongly
suggesting the disease can be transmitted by means other than a mosquito,
US health officials said on Thu 5 Sep 2002. The Atlanta-based Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it was still trying to determine
whether the single organ donor, whose organs also went to 3 other people
who tested positive for West Nile virus, became infected through a mosquito
bite or blood transfusions before organ donation. Yet the fact that all 4
recipients from the Georgia organ donor developed West Nile virus infection
"very strongly suggests that the transmissions occurred via organ
transplantation," said Lyle Petersen, Deputy Director for the Division of
Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases at the CDC. "I do not think that mosquito
bite for these 4 persons is very likely at this point," Petersen added.
Despite the questions the organ donation cases raise about how West Nile
virus is transmitted, officials said they believed mosquitoes, which pass
the infection from birds to humans and other animals, are the main means by
which people can acquire the virus. Infection with West Nile virus can
cause flu-like symptoms and in the worst cases encephalitis, a potentially
fatal inflammation of the brain. "Mosquitoes by far are the [most common?]
mode of transmission of West Nile virus," said Petersen. "There is
absolutely no proof at this point that West Nile virus transmission by
blood donation has occurred in the United States."
The CDC disclosed it was also investigating West Nile infection in a
Mississippi resident who was diagnosed nearly 4 weeks after receiving
multiple blood transfusions. It said that as a precaution, blood products
from donors to that patient had been withdrawn from blood banks. Petersen
said people who needed blood transfusions or donated organs should not be
frightened by the West Nile cases under investigation. "The medical benefit
of getting blood or organs far outweighs any potential risk of getting West
Nile virus from blood," Petersen said. The female Mississippi patient with
West Nile received 18 units of blood during surgery in late July 2002, said
Anthony Marfin, a CDC epidemiologist. The woman said she had numerous
mosquito bites, so officials could not say that transfusions were the
source of her infection.
The possibility that West Nile virus, which is common in Africa and Asia
[and some parts of Europe - Mod.CP] but first appeared in the United States
in a 1999 outbreak that killed 7 people in New York, could be acquired
through ways other than a mosquito bite surfaced in recent days as
officials determined that at least 3 of the 4 people who received organs
from the Georgia donor had West Nile virus infection. The Georgia organ
donor died last month [August 2002] after a car accident in late July. Of
the 3 other recipients who received organs, one has died, and 2 others are
recovering from encephalitis. The fourth recipient, a 71-year-old female
resident of Florida's Miami-Dade County, has been diagnosed with West Nile
fever, a milder form of the infection. She is recuperating at home, the CDC
said.
