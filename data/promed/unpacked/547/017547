Inquiry Into Possible Creutzfeldt-jakob Disease Death Link
----------------------------------------------------------
Public health officials are investigating a possible link amid fears that 2
near neighbors have died from the human form of mad cow disease [(new)
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. A 34-year old man has been confirmed as
having had (new) variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. The results of tests on
a 28-year old man, also from the Adswood area of Stockport, Greater
Manchester, are expected to be known within a fortnight. The 34-year old
man died in April, as his 28-year old neighbor was showing similar symptoms
of loss of memory and co-ordination.

[If a diagnosis of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is confirmed in the
case of the second victim, this will represent the third instance of
linkage or clustering of cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the
UK. - Mod.CP
