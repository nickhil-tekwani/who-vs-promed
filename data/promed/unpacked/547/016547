Epidemiology

Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection; Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments; After the detection of the outbreak, 150 000 head of cattle and sheep were vaccinated, samples collected and sent to the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Riyadh, and also to the OIE Reference Laboratory for FMD, The Pirbright Institute (United Kingdom). Genotyping showed that it was G-VII strain. Additional testing was completed by The Pirbright Institute to match the field strain with vaccines, and the result showed no effectiveness to A-Iran-05, while it showed some effectiveness to A-SAU-95.

Control measures

Measures applied Movement control inside the country
Vaccination in response to the outbreak (s)
Administrative division / Species / Total Vaccinated
Ar Riyad / Cattle / 120 000
Ar Riyad / Sheep / 30 000

Quarantine
No treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results

Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
The Pirbright Institute (United Kingdom) (OIE Reference Laboratory) / Cattle / real-time PCR / 19 Oct 2015 / Positive

[Saudi Arabia reported on 19 Oct 2015 that an FMD outbreak was recorded in 2 herds of cattle (total 93) and sheep (30) in Almarai Farm in Durma Province. Both species were reportedly clinically infected, no mortality reported. The report indicated that the outbreak had started on 13 Sep 2015 and that after its detection, 45 000 head of cattle and sheep were vaccinated (vaccine strain not disclosed), samples collected and sent to the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Riyadh, and also to the OIE Reference Laboratory for FMD, The Pirbright Institute (UK; WRLFMD).

According to the results obtained from the WRLFMD, the virus was identified as serotype A, topotype Asia, genotype VII, most closely related to strains circulating in the Indian subcontinent. The serotype A vaccine strains included in the genotyping tests did not match this new strain. The said strain is regarded as a new strain in Saudi Arabia, reported as such. The report further indicated that "the event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted." However, the current Saudi report is a follow-up report. It includes interesting information on vaccine strains tested. According to this information, the vaccine strain "A-SAU-95" showed some effectiveness, while A-Iran-05 showed no effectiveness. The concerning bottom line is that no commercially available vaccine confers satisfactory protection against the new strain at present.

On 16 Nov 2015, Turkey reported that an FMD epizootic later found to be caused by the same new serotype strain had started on 29 Sep 2015 on its eastern border, in the provinces Van and Bitlis. On 17 Dec 2015, Turkey notified the OIE, in a follow-up (final) report, that "the new strain of type A FMD virus has rapidly spread on a large area in Anatolia. The event is considered endemic and, therefore, no more follow-up reports will be sent." They further stated that "the event cannot be considered resolved, but the situation is sufficiently stable." Turkey reported that its veterinary institute manufactured a vaccine against the new strain, but no further information, including matching test results, have become publicly available so far.

In view of the (more than 2 months belated) reporting of a 2nd outbreak in Saudi Arabia, and the rapid spread of the new strain in Turkey's Anatolia -- of which detailed geographic information is awaited -- there is room for concern and need for enhanced surveillance in the countries bordering eastern Turkey (Georgia, Armenia, Iran, Iraq and Syria) as well as counties bordering Saudi Arabia. The (unpublished) rate of spread of the virus westwards in Turkey may have already obtained the due attention of the EUFMD. - Mod.AS
