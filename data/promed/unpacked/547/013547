LEGIONELLA - UNITED KINGDOM
===========================
Source: AFP in International Herald Tribune 30 Dec.1995 - 1 Jan.1996,
quoting The Times (of London)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Times reported on Friday 29 Dec. 1995 that unacceptable levels of the
bacteria that cause Legionnaire's disease had been found at the House of
Commons.
The paper said that although engineers had tried to cleanse the hot water
system at the Commons, tests had shown that traces of the bacteria remained.
[We do not have the figure for the average age of Members of Parliament, but
the average age of cases of Legionnaire's disease is in the 50s - Mod. (JW)]
