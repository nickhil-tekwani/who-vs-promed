Influenza update no 183
-----------------------
Summary
-------
- Influenza activity in North America appears to have declined during the last week of March [2013] since peaking in early January in Canada and the United States of America and approximately 2 weeks later in Mexico. Proportionally influenza B increased although influenza A(H3N2) was the most commonly detected virus in North America overall for this season [2012-13].
- Influenza activity continued to decline in Europe in general but in most parts of Eastern Europe where elevated levels of activity remained. The proportion of subtypes of viruses circulating was not uniform across the continent and has changed through the season. Influenza B mainly reported in western and northern countries and influenza A in eastern and central Europe. So far this season, excess mortality in most countries has been moderate and most deaths occurred among people aged 65 and older with no excess mortality in younger age groups.
- Influenza activity throughout the temperate region of Asia decreased overall with the exception of China and the Republic of Korea, which have reported sustained activity.
- Low levels of influenza activity continued to be reported across the tropical regions of the world and activity in countries of the southern hemisphere remained at inter-seasonal levels.
- Since the start of the season a few viruses with reduced susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors have been detected in the countries performing antiviral resistance testing. The majority of characterized influenza viruses were antigenically similar to the 2012-13 northern hemisphere vaccine viruses.
- In China, as of 12 Apr 2013, 43 cases of influenza A(H7N9) have been identified, of which 11 have died; please see details and more updated information at http://who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/en/index.html.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
---------------------------------------------------
North America
-------------
Overall influenza activity in North America appeared to have slowed during the last week of March [2013] since peaking in early January in Canada and the United States of America (USA) and approximately 2 weeks later in Mexico.

In Canada, the percentage of positive influenza tests remained relatively constant over the last several weeks at approximately 12.2 percent compared to 35 percent at the peak of the season in the 1st week of January [2013]. The national influenza-like-illness (ILI) consultation rate during the last week of March [2013] remained relatively low at 21.2 per 1000 patients, compared to the peak in late December [2012] of 36.8. Of the 433 influenza viruses detected in the last week of March in Canada, 25.9 percent were identified as influenza A and of those with subtype information, 16.1 percent were A(H3N2) and 26.8 percent were A(H1N1)pdm09. The proportion of positive influenza B specimens has continued to increase over the past 10 weeks from 2.1 percent in the 3rd week of January to 74.1 percent in the last week of March. However, cumulative seasonal proportions are still much higher for influenza A compared to B.

Since the start of the season, the National Microbiology Laboratory has antigenically characterized 902 influenza viruses (150 A(H1N1)pdm09, 515 A(H3N2), and 237 influenza B). Of these, all influenza A and influenza B viruses were antigenically similar to the 2012-13 northern hemisphere vaccine viruses, with the exception of 47/237 influenza B viruses which were similar to the B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria lineage) virus; a component of the 2011-2012 seasonal influenza vaccine. So far all viruses tested during this period showed no resistance to oseltamivir (0/730) or zanamivir (0/727).

In the United States of America (USA), during the last week of March [2013], influenza activity continued to decrease to levels below seasonal thresholds since peaking in late December [2012] to early January. Nationally, the proportion of ILI outpatient consultations decreased to 1.8 percent, below the national baseline of 2.2 percent. The proportion of clinical ILI specimens testing positive for influenza decreased from the peak of 38 percent in the last week of 2012 to 11.3 percent (555/4909) during the last week of March [2013].

The proportion of all deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) reported through the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System continued to decrease from the peak of 9.8 percent in the 4th week of January, to 7.4 percent, just below the epidemic threshold of 7.5 percent in the 2nd week of March. As of the last week of March, 111 influenza-related paediatric deaths have been reported so far this season [2012-13], compared to 34 for the entire season in 2011-12, and 122 in 2010-11. A total of 11 798 laboratory confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations were reported since the beginning of the season (cumulative rate of 42.3/100 000 population). This was notably higher than the previous 3 seasons (8.6, 21.4, and 29.0/100 000 population for the 2011-12, 2010-11, 2009-10 seasons respectively). Since the start of the season, influenza A(H3N2) viruses have predominated nationally, however in recent weeks, the proportion of influenza B viruses has increased.

During the last week of March [2013], 75 percent of all influenza positive specimens reported were influenza B viruses and influenza B viruses were more frequently reported than influenza A in all areas of the country. Cumulatively, the seasonal trend in the USA differed from Canada, where 91 percent of the all confirmed specimens were still influenza A.

Since the beginning of the 2012-13 influenza season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention characterized 1970 influenza viruses antigenically (203 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 1158 influenza A(H3N2), and 609 influenza B viruses). Of these, all influenza A and influenza B viruses were antigenically similar to the 2012-13 northern hemisphere vaccine viruses, with the exception of 183/609 influenza B viruses, which belonged to the B/Victoria/02/87-like lineage. In addition, 0.3 percent (4/1 158) of A(H3N2) and 1.5 percent (3/203) of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses tested showed reduced titres with antiserum produced against the A/Victoria/361/2011 and A/California/7/2009 viruses respectively.

Since the beginning of the season, 2 oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1)pdm09 virus have been reported out of 405 tested in this season. 2 A(H3N2)viruses out of 1577 tested have also been reported oseltamivir-resistant.

Mexico has reported relatively stable influenza activity over the last few weeks with a majority being influenza A(H3N2). Influenza activity in Mexico appears to have peaked approximately 2 weeks after the USA in the last half of January [2013].

Europe
------
Influenza activity continued to decline in most parts of the region, while some countries in the eastern part of the region are still reporting increased activity such as, Ukraine, Romania, and Russia compared to parts of Western Europe where activity is minimal such as, France, Italy, and Spain.

Consultation rates for ILI and acute respiratory infection (ARI) continued to decline throughout the region, with most countries reporting low activity in the first week of April. The percentage of sentinel ILI and/or ARI specimens testing positive for influenza has been declining since mid-February.
Although in the beginning of the season, A(H1N1)pdm09 remained the most commonly detected influenza virus in Europe but in recent weeks, this pattern seemed to be changing with northern and western countries reporting the dominance of influenza B. Influenza A was reported as the dominant virus in Croatia; Greece, Ireland, the Russian Federation, Turkey and the United Kingdom, while the rest of the countries in the Region reported mainly influenza B or co-circulation of influenza A and B. During the second week in April pooled analysis, based on 12 countries or regions, showed a flat but sustained peak of excess mortality among people aged 65 and older which started in the beginning of January. Cumulative winter excess mortality among older people since the beginning of the season till now showed excess mortality levels comparable to those of the 2011/2012 winter season. On the other hand, no excess mortality in younger age groups has been detected so far this season. However, countries such as Finland, Germany, Greece, Portugal, and Spain showed no or only very moderate increase in mortality.

Northern Africa and the Western Asia region
-------------------------------------
Across the northern Africa region the number of positive influenza specimens reported has continued to decrease substantially over the past several weeks since peaking in late February [2013]. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the dominant virus in most of the region, with countries such as Algeria reporting an increasing proportion of influenza B in the last few weeks.

Across the Western Asia region the number of positive influenza specimens reported has also decreased substantially over the past several weeks since peaking in early February [2013]. Most countries in the region have mainly seen influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 throughout the season, with the exception of Jordan and Pakistan reporting a majority of influenza B, especially in the last several weeks.

Northern and Eastern Asia
-------------------------
Influenza activity in much of the temperate region of Asia has decreased slightly over the past several weeks since peaking in the end of January [2013]. Activity has remained at noticeable levels in China and the Republic of Korea, which peaked several weeks later than most of the region. In northern China and Japan ILI activity and the percentage of ILI specimens tested positive for influenza virus has declined over the past several weeks since peaking in late January. In contrast, ILI activity in Mongolia, based on the proportion of countrywide outpatient visits, showed continued low-level activity, since peaking in early February.

As described in previous reports, influenza A(H3N2) has been the most commonly detected virus in most of northern Asia this season, with the exception of Northern China, where influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 has shown an increasing proportion of positive influenza specimens detected. Activity in northern China, during the last week of March [2013], remained low and the percentage of positive influenza specimens was 8.4 percent, compared to a peak of approximately 27 percent in the beginning of January. Among influenza viruses antigenically characterized by the Chinese National Influenza Center since the beginning of the 2012-13 season, 99.5 percent (191) of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses were characterized as A/California/7/2009-like and 100 percent (577) of influenza A (H3N2) viruses were A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2)-like. For influenza B, 100 percent (25) of the viruses were characterized as B/Wisconsin/01/2010-like (B/Yamagata lineage) and 96.7 percent (147) were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria- lineage).

Of the influenza viruses tested since October 2012, all A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B viruses were sensitive to the neuraminidase inhibitors.

In China, as of April 12, 2013, 43 cases of influenza A(H7N9) have been identified, of which eleven have died, more and updated information will be posted at: http://who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/e

Countries in the tropical zone
-------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean
--------------------------------------------------------------------
In both Central America and the Caribbean, influenza activity was similar compared to previous weeks. Across the region, co-circulation of influenza A(H3N2), influenza B, and low numbers of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses continued to be reported, with influenza A(H3N2) constituting the majority. In general, most ILI and acute respiratory cases were reported to be non-influenza illnesses, with respiratory syncytial virus as the most commonly reported causative agent. Cuba continued to report slight activity with co-circulation of both influenza A viruses.

In tropical South America, influenza activity remained low. Ecuador reported decreasing levels of influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B since peaking at the end of February. In recent weeks, French Guiana has reported low-level increasing influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B.

Central African tropical region
-------------------------------
Most countries in the Central African tropical region such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, and Madagascar, experienced low grade, but persistent, co-circulation of all 3 influenza viruses over the past several weeks. Kenya continued to report co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), while Madagascar reported influenza B (higher levels) and A(H1N1)pdm09. The Democratic Republic of Congo reported active transmission with circulation or all three viruses in the past weeks.

Tropical Asia
-------------
Influenza transmission in southern Asia was at low levels compared to previous weeks. In India, cocirculation of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) was reported, unlike the end of February [2013], where A(H1N1)pdm09 was predominant and some levels of influenza B were also detected. Sri Lanka reported reduced levels of influenza activity this week with equal proportions for all viruses. Iran and Pakistan also experienced lower activity this week with only influenza B virus detected in Iran while all 2 viruses were detected in Pakistan but with higher numbers of influenza B reported.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
---------------------------------------------------
Influenza activity in all temperate countries of the southern hemisphere is now at inter-seasonal levels.
