Workers in a dairy in Puerto Octay, Los Lagos region, have been infected through contact with cows and sheep with Q fever, a strange disease that has symptoms similar to pneumonia and also affects the gastrointestinal system.

At the end of October 2017, the infections reached 47, 20 of them required hospitalization due to the severity of the symptoms, 3 of them even required connection to mechanical ventilation. The situation has worsened and infections have risen to 56, according to the Assistant Sub-Secretary of Public Health, Cristian Herrera.

As a result of this scenario and according to sources of Radio Bio Bio, the Ministry of Health would decree sanitary alert in 2 regions of the country, Los Lagos and Los Rios, to face the outbreak of this disease. In fact, the Undersecretariat sent the decree to the Comptroller's Office on [Mon 6 Nov 2017] and is awaiting approval.

The disease is difficult to detect in Chile, since the transfer to humans is unusual and there is no easy way to confirm it. Because of this, international assistance is requested, which is what the Ministry of Health did a few weeks ago, by contacting the World Health Organization (WHO), Canada and the University of Queensland.

The past president of the Chilean Society of Infectology, Jeanette Dabanch, said that it is a new disease in Chile because although it is common in animals, without causing any symptoms, human infection is uncommon. Dabanch added that it is difficult to establish - for now - the true magnitude of the outbreak in humans and to quantify the proportion of cases, which could increase.

[Q fever, often acquired by close exposure to animals, is infectious with a very low inoculum and may be aerosolized over a significant distance. _Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937. This organism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and desiccation and is highly infectious by the aerosol route. A single inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of primates was found to be 1.7 organisms (1).

Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_. Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including other species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing, the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).

The organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is associated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are produced during standard replication along with the less resistant large cell form, metabolically dormant and spore-like (3).

Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to cause infection.

Ingestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites and human-to-human transmission are rare.
