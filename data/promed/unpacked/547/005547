In Portugal, two outbreaks of _Citrus tristeza virus_ (_Closterovirus_, CTV - EPPO A2 List) were reported in 2017. During official surveys, CTV was detected in June 2017 in 7 citrus trees (_Citrus sinensis_ [sweet orange] and _C. reticulata_ [mandarin]) growing in a private garden in the municipality of Sao Pedro de Merelim (Norte region). In October 2017, CTV was also detected in an urban area in the municipality of Sepins (Centro region) on asymptomatic citrus trees planted as ornamentals along a road. In both cases, eradication measures were taken (NPPO of Portugal).

[_Citrus tristeza virus_ (CTV; genus _Closterovirus_) is considered to be one of the most destructive citrus viruses and has destroyed millions of trees worldwide. Besides citrus species (family of Rutacea), it affects hosts in only few other families. It appears to be spreading wherever citrus is grown. Symptoms may include mottling, yellowing and necrosis of leaves; distortion and spots on fruits; under-bark pitting and gumming on twigs; branch and crown dieback followed eventually by death of the tree. Disease severity depends on viral strains, citrus variety and the scion-rootstock combination. CTV strains are generally grouped into seedling yellows, quick decline, stem pitting and a mild type. Strains may occur singly or in combination.

The virus is spread by several aphid species (including species of _Toxoptera_ and _Aphis_) in a non-persistent manner and infectious insects may be carried on the wind for long distances. CTV can also be transmitted by grafting and mechanical means. Disease management for CTV may include clean planting stock and budwood, elimination of inoculum and vector control. Introduction of more severe strains is a constant risk even in CTV-affected areas.

In Europe, the most severe type of stem pitting symptoms have so far not been reported and the cotton aphid (_A. gossypii_) is the most important vector. The majority of European CTV isolates cause severe decline particularly in sweet orange and mandarin, as reported above from Portugal. Susceptible rootstocks, widely used in the region, are currently being replaced by some countries to manage the impact of CTV.
