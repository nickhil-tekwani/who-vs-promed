Recently, a U.S. Public Health Service meeting was held in Bethesda in
which newly revised guidelines for xenotransplantation were presented.
Unfortunately, the guidelines have not dealt with the issue of species
differences in regard to infectious disease risks. As the guidelines
currently stand, there is no difference between baboons and pigs as donors
for xenotransplantation. My public comments addressing this issue have
focused on inherent risk differences between baboons and pigs. Without
addressing these differences, other countries are likely to begin
developing baboons as donors for xenotransplantation which could have
global consequences. While the FDA is assuming responsibility for
regulating xenotransplantation via INDs, rather vague guidelines means that
transplant surgeons in other countries will have a green light to use
baboons for transplantation raising the spectre of transmitting simian
viruses to humans. Furthermore, diagnostic tests to screen for most of the
baboon viruses are still being developed and there is no list of agents
that should be excluded.
I would strongly urge that nonhuman primates not be developed as a donor
species for human transplantation at the present moment because of the
relatively large and unknown risks associated with these procedures.
Implicit in the use of baboons or other nonhuman primates is the fact that
they carry an inordinate number of herpesviruses and retroviruses. Based on
current technologies it is virtually impossible to provide a clean animal
for use in humans. Recent studies indicate that baboons harbor several
endogenous retroviruses, one of which is remarkably similar to a virus that
causes simian AIDS. This virus is apparently expressed in baboons and
antibodies have been detected to this endogenous type D virus (3). What
this means is that we cannot expect to safely provide baboons for these
procedures due to both known and unknown persistent viruses harbored by
nonhuman primates.
In fact, this "request for information" underscores the problems associated
with the PHS guidelines in their present form. If we want to protect public
health then PHS needs to more clearly address the inherent risks associated
with nonhuman primates and take a leadership role in ensuring public's
safety.i would urge anyone with similar concerns to contact Dr. Amy
Patterson (e-mail:pattersona@A1.cber.fda.gov) at the FDA and express those
concerns.
