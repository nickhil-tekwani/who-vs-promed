Even as Health Minister Hamad Al-Mane ruled out any [human] case of Rift
Valley Fever in the southwest Jizan region, residents in the Asir region
sounded the alarm for Malta Fever, the Arabic language daily Okaz reported.
Lab analysis [which test? - Mod.AS] for the 2 suspected [human] cases in
Al-Karbous village in the Al-Khashal center confirmed non-existence of RVF
and the cases were of malaria [or Malta fever?! - Mod.AS], Al-Mane said.
King Fahad Hospital in Jizan received the 2 suspected RVF cases. A medical
source said both the cases were in residents from Al-Karbous village, and
one of them works in the health college in Jizan. Both are being treated in
the Intensive Care Unit .
Dr. Ali Bin Qasim Al-Qahtani, the region's health affairs director general,
said a team of medical experts was immediately sent with a pest [insects?]
control team to check out the village.
RVF can be carried by mosquitoes from livestock to human beings, causing
the victims to suffer swollen brains and burst arteries. [This terminology
might be related to difficulties along the Arabic-English translation
route; they probably refer to the congested and edematous brains and to
subcutaneous hemorrhages characteristic of RVF in humans. - Mod.AS]
Meanwhile, residents of Al-Rabouah centers in the Asir region are concerned
about a recent outbreak of Malta fever.
Malta Fever, also known as undulant fever or brucellosis, is an infection
transmitted to humans from cattle, [sheep] and goats. It may present itself
as an acute illness (fever, chills, etc.) or as a chronic illness (months
or years of weight loss, low-grade fevers, and fatigue). Other symptoms
include enlarged lymph glands and spleen and occasionally enlarged liver.
A number of the residents requested that the agricultural ministry branch
in the region take immediate action and quickly begin vaccination [of
susceptible animals] to prevent disease spread. [The vaccine applied for
vaccination against _B. melitensis_ is, generally, the Rev.1 vaccine. - Mod.AS]
The health center registered 19 such [human] cases [of brucellosis?] in the
last 20 days, and the center does not have any treatment for the disease
that has begun to spread among children.[This statement needs
clarification; specific antibiotic treatment of brucellosis patients should
be available. - Mod.AS]
Al-Watan newspaper reported hundreds of cattle afflicted with the disease
in the Jizan region.

[RVF is an important zoonotic OIE-List-A disease, the detection of which
would have serious national and international implications. Thus far, the
suspicions of RVF in animals in Jizan, initially published on 6 Sep 2004
citing the Saudi Minister of Agriculture, have been neither finally
confirmed nor refuted.
An official notification, to include results of the performed tests, will
allow the needed assessment of the true epizootiological situation. Such
information should preferably be available the earliest, to allow -- in
case affirmative -- the appropriate prevention and control steps to be
taken ahead of the Eid al-Fitr festivities (this year in mid-November).
During these holidays, in-home slaughter of ruminants, mainly sheep and
goats, is widely practiced in Muslim countries, especially in rural areas,
potentially exposing humans to RVF-infected aerosols.
Regarding Malta fever, the reader is referred to ref 20040716.1926. - Mod.AS]
[This newswire is confusing as to whether RVF has been completely ruled out
in humans, and as to whether there is an ongoing brucellosis outbreak among
livestock and humans in this area. More information from authoritative
sources would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
