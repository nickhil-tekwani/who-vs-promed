A cluster of botulism cases has been reported in the Dubovsky
district of the Rostov region. The Territorial management of
Rospotrebnadzor (Federal Service for Surveillance of Consumer Rights
and Human Welfare - Mod.NP) in the Rostov region reported that on Mon
16 Apr 2007, 6 local residents were hospitalized in the Central
Regional Hospital of the Dubovsky district with symptoms of botulism.
It was established that all patients had consumed home-canned
mushrooms that had been picked in a forest belt near the village
According to data from Rospotrebnadzor, since the beginning of 2007,
8 persons have been hospitalized with botulism in hospitals in the
Rostov region, where annually 25-30 persons contract the disease.
During 2005-2006, 10 inhabitants of the Rostov region died from
botulism. As yet, no deaths have been registered in 2007.
Rospotrebnadzor stressed that the vehicles for transmission of the
disease, as a rule, are canned mushrooms and vegetables and smoked
fish prepared in domestic conditions.

[According to the latest information, botulinum toxin type A has been
found in the blood of the patients.
<http://www.dontr.ru/Environ/WebObjects/dontr.woa/wa/Main?textid=23626>
(in Russian).
Botulinum toxin type E, usually associated with marine sources,
prevails in the region. More than 20 cases of botulism, including 5
fatalities were reported in the Rostov region in 2006. Most
frequently, lethal outcomes were connected with late access to
medical care (2-3 days after onset). Cases of the disease related to
the consumption of dried and smoked fish are prevalent in the
southern areas of the region located in a steppe zone in the mouth of
the river Don and on the coast of the Taganrog Gulf of the Azov sea.
Botulism associated with the consumption of canned mushrooms more
often is reported in the northern forest-steppe areas. The disease
linked to the consumption of home-canned vegetables occurs everywhere.
The Rostov-on-Don Region is located in the southern part of the
East-European plateau and partly in the North Caucasian region. It
