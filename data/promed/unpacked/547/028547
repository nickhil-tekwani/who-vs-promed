The presence of infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) virus has been
confirmed on a 3rd salmon farm in the Burra area west of Shetland.

This farm lies within the control zone that was established on 2 Jan
2009, when the 1st case of ISA was confirmed at a fish farm also in
the Burra area west of Shetland.

Scotland Fisheries Research (FRS) Service has announced that control
zones were established around the confirmed infected sites and that a
surveillance zone was set up around this control zone. These controls
facilitate monitoring of fish farming sites in the surrounding area,
as required by UK and EU regulations for the control of serious fish
diseases. This control zone has increased in size with the
confirmation of infection on a 3rd site.

FRS Fish Health Inspectors are continuing to work in Shetland to
investigate the affected sites. Investigations into the potential
source and spread of ISA are continuing.

Statutory controls imposed on the movement of live and dead fish
within the control and surveillance zones remain in place to minimise
the risk of the spread of the infection.

All of the fish farm sites have been inspected by staff from the FRS
Fish Health Inspectorate, with further samples being taken from some
of those sites to establish the current situation on each.

There are 40 registered fish farming sites in the southwest Shetland
management area, although not all of these sites are currently
holding fish.

All sites holding species susceptible to or able to act as a vector
for ISA virus will be required to be fallowed (emptied of stock),
cleaned and disinfected before being restocked. The length of this
fallow period will vary depending upon site risk evaluation.
