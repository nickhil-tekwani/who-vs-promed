Salmonella cases [in South Australia] are 15 per cent higher than the 5 year average with nearly 1200 people ill so far. The state reported 1561 cases and had 1370 at the same point in time in 2016.

Dr Fay Jenkins, SA health director of food and controlled drugs, said on average there are 1172 reports of salmonellosis across the state each year. "With 12 outbreaks and 1182 people struck down with this illness this year [2017]to date, we have already recorded more salmonella cases than we normally see in a full year. Of particular concern is that 17 per cent of those cases have been in children aged less than 5 years."
Australian Food Safety Week started on [11 Nov 2017] and runs until [18 Nov 2017].

The exact cause of salmonellosis is often hard to pinpoint but with some strains unsafe egg handling is a common factor, said Dr Jenkins. "To reduce the risk of sickness, do not use eggs if they are cracked or dirty, wash your hands after handling eggs and keep raw egg products like aioli, mayonnaise and mousse refrigerated.

"Of course, eggs are only one of many sources of salmonella, so being aware of food safety in and out of the home is more important than ever. This is why people need to be vigilant about handling, cooking and storing food correctly as most cases of foodborne illness are preventable through good hygiene and safe food handling practices", she added.

[Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. It is clearly the case, however, that most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation, and thus were contaminated with the bacteria before the egg shell was formed. To avoid this, uncooked eggs should only be used as an ingredient, if pasteurized. - Mod.LL
