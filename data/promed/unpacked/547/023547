Health probe as Ebola scare woman dies
----------------------------------
Scientists are waiting for results of tests to confirm if a woman who
bled to death on Thursday died of Ebola [haemorrhagic fever]. Three
people who took the woman to hospital were also put in an isolation
ward at the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH). They are being checked
for the deadly virus that is highly contagious.

The patient was said to have been bleeding from all openings and was
declared death on arrival.
“She had what looked like suspicious sudden onset of bleeding and as
part of our public health concern we have to investigate and find out
what caused it,” said Dr Masika Wafula, a consultant at the
Infectious Diseases Unit. Preliminary results from tests by the Kenya
Medical Research Institute and the Centre for Disease Control (CDC)
are expected on Friday [23 Dec 2011 afternoon. Dr Wafula declined to
speculate the cause of the death, saying the bleeding could have been
as a result of multiple conditions.

The woman’s father, her friend and a taxi driver were first
quarantined at the tents usually used for blood donation for several
hours. Their car was also detained. They were later moved to a ward
where they will be kept in isolation until doctors determine the cause
of the woman'sMuthoni’s death. Experts from the Ministry of Public
Health, Division of Disease Surveillance and Response are reported to
have taken over the investigation.

The 29-year-old wman was said to have been in good health when she
reported to work yesterday morning at the Timboroa Hotel in downtown
Nairobi. “She even went to the market and was going about her duties
at work when she started bleeding,” said persister. “When it
increased, the manager called our father who went to pick her up.”

Dr Ashford Parantai, who was among the experts who received the body
at the hospital, said incubation period for haemorrhagic fever is
18-48 hours. “The disease is spread by coming into contact with an
infected person or body secretions,” Dr Parantai said.
