Abstract
---------
Background
Additional interventions are needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by malaria.

Methods
We conducted a two-part, phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of CIS43LS, an antimalarial monoclonal antibody with an extended half-life, and its efficacy against infection with _Plasmodium falciparum_. Part A of the trial assessed the safety, initial side-effect profile, and pharmacokinetics of CIS43LS in healthy adults who had never had malaria. Participants received CIS43LS subcutaneously or intravenously at one of 3 escalating dose levels. A subgroup of participants from Part A continued to Part B, and some received a second CIS43LS infusion. Additional participants were enrolled in Part B and received CIS43LS intravenously. To assess the protective efficacy of CIS43LS, some participants underwent controlled human malaria infection in which they were exposed to mosquitoes carrying _P. falciparum_ sporozoites 4 to 36 weeks after administration of CIS43LS.

Results
A total of 25 participants received CIS43LS at a dose of 5 mg per kilogram of body weight, 20 mg per kilogram, or 40 mg per kilogram, and 4 of the 25 participants received a second dose (20 mg per kilogram regardless of initial dose). No safety concerns were identified. We observed dose-dependent increases in CIS43LS serum concentrations, with a half-life of 56 days. None of the 9 participants who received CIS43LS, as compared with 5 of 6 control participants who did not receive CIS43LS, had parasitemia according to polymerase-chain-reaction testing through 21 days after controlled human malaria infection. 2 participants who received 40 mg per kilogram of CIS43LS and underwent controlled human malaria infection approximately 36 weeks later had no parasitemia, with serum concentrations of CIS43LS of 46 and 57 Î¼g per milliliter at the time of controlled human malaria infection.

Conclusions
Among adults who had never had malaria infection or vaccination, administration of the long-acting monoclonal antibody CIS43LS prevented malaria after controlled infection. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; VRC 612 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04206332)

[This is the paper in the NEJM:
Gaudinski MR et al. A Monoclonal Antibody for Malaria Prevention. N Engl J Med 11 Aug 2021. <DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2034031>.

It is well known that immunoglobulins from malaria immune people can reduce malaria parasitemia in people with no or lesser immunity (Cohen S et al. Gamma-globulin and acquired immunity to human malaria. Nature 1961;192:733-7. <doi: 10.1038/192733a0.1961>). The hypothesis since this study 60 years ago was that the immunoglobulin that was acquired from people living in highly endemic areas was polyclonal covering numerous epitopes. This explain the slow development of clinical immunity to malaria in endemic areas (Petersen E et al. Development of immunity against _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria: clinical and parasitologic immunity cannot be separated. J Infect Dis. 1991 Nov;164(5):949-53. <doi: 10.1093/infdis/164.5.949>). It is therefore a major achievement to develop a monoclonal antibody which can suppress mosquito induced malaria in humans.

The concern will be that perhaps not all _P. falciparum_ isolates will be equally susceptible. If this is indeed a major tool in the future the antigen eliciting the monoclonal antibody will also be a vaccine candidate. - Mod.EP]
