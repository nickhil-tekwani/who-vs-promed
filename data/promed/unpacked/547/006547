Guidelines for Member States enhanced surveillance for avian influenza
viruses in wild birds in the European Union - September 2005 to January 2006
---------------------------------------------------
1. Survey design:
1. A. Active surveillance on living or hunted birds
- identify species of wild birds presenting higher risk based upon:
i) origin and migratory flyways,
ii) numbers in the EU and
iii) likelihood of contact with domestic poultry. The Annexed list of
higher risk species must be taken into account, but must be considered
provisional;
- identify sites at risk based upon:
i) mixing sites of high number of migratory birds involving different
species and in particular those listed in the Annex
ii) proximity to domestic poultry farms, and
iii) location along migratory flyways;
- sampling must take account of the seasonality of migration patterns
(these may vary in different Member States).
1. B. Passive surveillance on wild birds found dead
- should primarily target the occurrence of abnormal mortality or
significant disease outbreaks in:
i) wild birds species indicated in the Annex and other wild birds living in
contact with them, and
ii) at sites as indicated above. The occurrence of mortality in several
species at the same site would be an additional factor to consider.
2. Sampling procedures and testing
- In addition to cloacal swabs or faeces, tissues (i.e. brain, heart, lung,
kidney and intestine) from birds found dead or shot should also be sampled
for virus isolation and molecular detection (PCR). Molecular techniques
should only be carried out in laboratories able to guarantee quality
assurance and using methods recognised by the Community Reference
Laboratory for Avian Influenza;
- Pooling of up to 5 samples from the same species collected at the same
site and same time is possible
Collaboration and coordination between veterinary authorities,
epidemiologists, laboratory experts and ornithological institutions at EU
level should be reinforced. The Commission and the Member States should
explore all means to reach this goal, with special emphasis on
bringing together existing expertise in the relevant fields with the
objective of establishing an EU surveillance network.
Annex
Provisional list of wild bird species presenting higher risk in relation to
avian influenza (Latin and English names).
Latin name, English name:
1. _Anser albifrons_, White-fronted Goose
2. _Anser fabalis_, Bean Goose
3. _Anas platyrhynchos_, Mallard
4. _Anas strepera_, Gadwal
5. _Anas acuta_, Northern Pintail
6. _Anas clypeata_, Northern Shoveler
7. _Anas Penelope_, Eurasian Wigeon
8. _Anas crecca_, Common teal
9. _Anas querquedula_, Garganay
10. _Aythya ferina_ Common Pochard
11. _Aythya fuligula_, Tufted Duck
12. _Vanellus vanellus_, Northern Lapwing
13. _Philomachus pugnax_, Ruff
14. _Larus ribibundus_, Black-headed Gull
15. _Larus canus_, Common Gull
All naturally occurring wild birds species in the EU, including the above
listed species, fall under the protection regime of Directive 79/409/EEC on
the conservation of wild birds and therefore full regard should be taken of
the requirements of this Directive in any surveillance for Avian Influenza.

[The above guidelines were stipulated in September 2005 by EU's Standing
Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health - Working group meeting on
avian influenza surveillance in wild birds. They seem to be useful for
other parties as well. The above species list is titled "provisional",
indicative of possible future addition of other species. H5N1 has been
already detected in other species; the following items [2] and [3] may
serve as an illumination of the need for a wider spectrum of wild birds to
be surveyed. - Mod.AS]

Dozens of migrating birds have died mysteriously over the past few days,
increasing fears bird flu has arrived in Lebanon. Farmers in Ras al-Ain and
Qleileh say they fear the "cause behind the deaths is contagious and will
spread to chicken farms along the Tyrian coast." [See map
<http://www.middleeastuk.com/destinations/lebanon/Lebanon%20Map1.jpg>].
Several farmers living on the coast south of Tyre reported seeing dozens of
migrating storks fall from the sky while flying along the shore near Ras
al-Ain.
[Map <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/LE/2/Ras_al_Ayn.html>].
One farmer, Khalil Shehab, described counting over 20 birds. "We found them
breathing their last breath," said Shehab.
The men called the Civil Defense, who advised them to contact the
Agriculture Ministry. The ministry sent 2 employees, who took samples to
conduct tests, claiming it was the 1st time they had seen such birds in the
area.
Head of the Agriculture Authority in the South Hassan Souli said the
ministry had sent 2 samples to laboratories in Fanar and the American
University of Beirut, which will release the results soon.
Similar deaths were registered among other species of birds in more than
one town in the South. Many poultry farmers were seen entering the ministry
offices in Tyre carrying pieces of dead chickens for testing.
Sources said reported cases of dead migrating birds were not restricted to
storks; quail were also victims of this virus. The Agriculture Ministry has
since conducted tests on quail samples and found them virus-free.

A heron found dead a week ago in Romania in an uninhabited area near the
border with Moldova has tested positive for the deadly H5N1 virus, the
Agriculture Ministry said on Friday.
Earlier this month, Romania became the 1st European mainland country to
detect H5N1 in birds in 2 villages in the Danube delta, in the southeast of
the country.
Last week, a heron was diagnosed with anti-bodies for bird flu in the
eastern county of Vaslui, 100 km (60 miles) north of the Danube delta, in
an area not in the immediate vicinity of a any villages or towns.
"Yesterday, the laboratory in Britain confirmed the presence of the H5N1
virus in the heron found in Vaslui county, diagnosed with bird flu on 21
Oct 2005," the ministry said in a statement.
Authorities in Vaslui county told people to keep chickens indoors to avoid
the virus spreading to domestic birds.
The ministry said more than 500 tests were conducted in the past 2 weeks on
birds in the southeast of the country and all were negative for bird flu.
The deadly strain was first found in samples taken from 2 villages in the
Danube delta, 40 km (25 miles) apart. More than 21 000 domestic birds in
the 2 villages were killed and the villages were placed under quarantine.

[Herons are any of various wading birds of the family Ardeidae, having a
long neck, long legs, a long pointed bill, and usually white, gray, or
bluish-gray plumage. Data on the exact identity of the avian found infected
with H5N1 in eastern Romania will be appreciated. The absence of herons in
the list of birds annexed to the EU guidelines above is demonstrative of
the provisional nature of the said list.
In a separate newswire from Slovenia, it was announced that tests ruled out
bird flu virus in a suspected swan. - Mod.AS]

The government is set to backpedal on the pledge by health minister York
Chow Yat-ngok that the borders will be sealed if a bird flu pandemic knocks
on the door of Hong Kong.
This follows what a government source said last night [27 Oct 2005] was
local and international concern about the enormous social and economic
effects of such a move. It also follows a denial by the Ministry of Health
of a statement by Vice-Minister of Health Huang Jiefu, who said earlier
China would seal its borders if there was even one case of human-to-human
transmission of bird flu.
The latest moves came as access remained highly controlled to the Hunan
village of Wantang where a girl died, although authorities said initial
tests showed she did not have the deadly H5N1 virus.
Despite the controls -- with entrances to the village tightly guarded to
prevent outsiders, including reporters, from entering -- chickens and ducks
were still running freely inside the village and dead fowl could be seen
lying in the field.
Inner Mongolia, Anhui and Hunan have all reported bird flu outbreaks of
different scales within a week.
The authorities have vowed to cull all poultry within 1 km from the
affected area. But many families living in the village still kept their
chicken and ducks, which they said they could not afford to lose.
"This outbreak ruined our economy. I don't want to kill my birds. They look
very healthy to me", one villager said.

China insisted there had been no documented human cases of bird flu in the
country despite 3 outbreaks among poultry in the past week.
Beijing reported 3 outbreaks of bird flu in the northern region of Inner
Mongolia and the provinces of Hunan and Anhui.
"At present the 3 outbreaks were stamped out and no new cases found," said
Jia Youling, chief veterinary officer of the ministry of agriculture.
"According to the ministry of health, there are no reports of human
infection," Jia said at the press conference organised by the State
Council, China's cabinet.
The World Health Organisation said Friday [28 Oct 2005] in Geneva it had
asked China to investigate media reports of 2 human cases of bird flu in
the country.
"The WHO heard about these cases, a daughter and her brother, by media
reports," said spokeswoman Fadela Chaib. "We have asked the ministry of
health of China to investigate the cases," she added. Chinese authorities
had told the WHO that a team from the central health ministry was
dispatched to the region to investigate.
China has had 7 outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry so far this year,
according to the WHO.
China initially covered up the deadly outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) more than 2 years ago, and officials on Friday were eager
to signal this would not happen again. International health officials have
warned that a swift and transparent response is needed to any human cases
of bird flu to prevent the virus turning into a pandemic strain.
The WTO also warned that Africa's weak surveillance and health care systems
would hamper critical early warning of the presence of the H5N1 virus or
clusters of human cases.

[There are some discrepancies between the 2 newswires from China. The
difficulty in persuading farmers to cooperate in the prescribed culling of
their poultry when adjacent to disease foci might be related to their
perceiving vaccination -- which is being widely applied in China -- as a
seemingly plausible alternative to culling. - Mod.AS]

Russia's Agriculture Ministry said on Friday [28 Oct 2005] that new bird
flu outbreaks had been registered in 3 Russian regions already hit by the
virus.
A ministry statement said outbreaks had been confirmed in the Tambov
region, 400 km (298 miles) southeast of Moscow, in Omsk region in eastern
Siberia and Kurgan in southern Urals. The statement did not identify the
strain of the virus, and gave no other details.
Russia has been fighting bird flu since mid-July [2005] and has culled more
than 600 000 domestic fowl.
Local news agencies quoted Agriculture Minister Alexei Gordeyev as saying
on Friday that bird flu would disappear in Russia in a couple of weeks,
after most migratory birds leave the country.

It is not clear whether these outbreaks are new. Russia's last follow-up
report (No 4) to the OIE was sent on 19 Oct 2005; a current update would
help. For the available reports from all H5 affected countries, see OIE's
update as of 28 Oct 2005 at
