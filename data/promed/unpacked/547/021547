The Asian longhorned tick -- an invasive species with the potential to cause severe anemia and tick fever in livestock -- has been positively identified on a cow in Pickens County (North Central GA), the Georgia Department of Agriculture (GDA) announced 21 Sep [2021]. "The USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories made the positive identification," UGA Entomologist Dr Nancy Hinkle said.

"The Asian longhorned tick looks very similar to other ticks in Georgia, so we don't expect people to be able to distinguish them. One distinctive aspect of Asian longhorned ticks is they tend to occur in large numbers. If an animal has one tick it's probably our common lone star tick," Hinkle said. "If a cow [or another animal] shows up with hundreds of ticks on it, we're going to be very suspicious that we're looking at an Asian longhorned tick infestation."

Asian longhorned ticks (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) are light brown and can be smaller than a sesame seed before expanding to the size of a pea when full of blood, according to the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Most Asian longhorned ticks (ALT) are female and can reproduce without a male. One female ALT can produce 1000 to 2000 eggs at one time without mating, APHIS reports. This is how a single animal could find itself hosting hundreds of ticks.

Hinkle's baseline data shows that prior to the arrival of the ALT in Georgia, there were 22 species of ticks in the state. Some of these species were only found on the gopher tortoise or squirrels. Hinkle says the lone star tick is the most common tick in the Southeast and can be found on a wide range of animals. "If you have a tick on you, your dog, or other animals, the vast majority of times it will be a lone star," Hinkle said.

What's the AL tick's impact on animals?
---------------------------------------
APHIS explains that an individual animal with a heavy infestation of ticks will be stressed and experience reduced growth and production. A severe infestation could potentially kill the animal from excessive blood loss. In other countries with established ALT populations, the species can transmit bovine theileriosis (infectious anemia) to cattle and babesiosis (tick fever) to several domestic animal species, according to APHIS.

Where did it come from?
-----------------------
This tick species is native to eastern Asia and had spread to Australia, New Zealand, and western Pacific islands (New Caledonia, Fiji) by the early 1900s. In these countries, the species is called bush tick, cattle tick, or scrub tick.

According to APHIS, the ALT probably arrived in the US in or before 2010 via domestic pets, horses, livestock, or people.

In late 2017, the USDA confirmed the ALT was present in the United States when the species was identified on a sheep in New Jersey, according to the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife. In less than 4 years, the species has been identified in 17 states, ranging from lower New England to Arkansas. Georgia is the latest state added to the list.

Hinkle says other states where the ALT has been identified are: (listed geographically from north to south to west): Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Missouri, and Arkansas, where it has been detected along the state's border with east Oklahoma.

What should producers do if they suspect an ALT infestation?
------------------------------------------------------------
Livestock producers are encouraged to help determine the extent of the ALT's presence in the state by monitoring their cattle, goats, horses, and sheep for large infestations of ticks.

Since the summer of 2019, Hinkle has been conducting a study to watch for the expected arrival of the ALT in Georgia and collecting baseline information on existing tick populations related to Georgia cattle prior to the ALT's arrival.

Anyone who finds large infestations of ticks on an individual animal - cattlemen, horse people, backyard poultry producers, pet owners, hunters - should call their veterinarian and report it to their state Department of Agriculture.

Can livestock producers control ALT population?
-----------------------------------------------
The GDA recommends that livestock producers or backyard poultry growers work with their veterinarian and/or UGA Cooperative Extension agent to develop an appropriate strategy to fight tick infestations of any type. "The good news is that products registered for use on cattle that are recommended for other tick species will be effective against ALT," Hinkle said.

With the discovery of the Asian longhorn tick in Georgia, another state is added to its geographic range in the USA. This invasive tick continues to spread rather quickly in the Eastern and Midwestern USA. The US Department of Agriculture APHIS publishes information updated monthly on the occurrence of this invasive tick over time in states and counties and the hosts upon which it was found. The latest update, as of 10 Sep 2021, reports the presence of the tick in 17 states (see numbers, hosts, and a map at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_diseases/tick/downloads/longhorned-tick-sitrep.pdf) and now, with Georgia, the total is 18 states. There are no barriers to halt the spread of this tick to additional states in the USA. Surveillance for this tick in states neighboring those where the tick is present currently would be prudent.

The tick can reproduce parthenogenetically (without a male); as such, a single fed female tick can create a population. It is also a known/suspected vector of several viral, bacterial, and protozoan agents of livestock and human diseases in other parts of the world, although none of these pathogens has been found in the ticks tested in the USA so far. This 3-host tick could spread pathogens among a diverse host range, on which it feeds side-by-side with other tick species.
