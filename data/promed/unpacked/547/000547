Following reports of the 1st case of mumps in a UMass [University of Massachusetts] Boston (UMB) last week [week of 1 Mar 2016], school officials announced [Tue 8 Mar 2016] a 2nd confirmed case of the contagious viral disease.

The 1st on campus case occurred on 20 Feb 2016 during the UMB Men's hockey team match against University of Southern Maine (USM), according to a University Health Services release.

USM has previously reported a confirmed mumps case last week.

Mumps is a contagious disease. The most common symptom is swelling of the cheeks and jaw due to inflammation of one or both of the saliva glands near the ear and back of the jaw. However, up to half of the people with mumps may not have enough swelling to show. Other symptoms include fever, headache, stiff neck, and loss of appetite.

Currently, there is no specific treatment for mumps. Supportive care should be given as needed. If someone becomes very ill, they should seek medical attention. If someone seeks medical attention, they should call their healthcare provider in advance so that they do not have to sit in the waiting room for a long time and possibly infect other people.

UMB student health asks that you seek medical care if you experience any of the symptoms noted above in the next 2 weeks. Please call or come to see us, or visit your own healthcare provider. Please be sure to tell your provider that there was a confirmed case of mumps on campus.

[The report stated the University of Massachusetts Boston hockey team was matched against Southern Maine University (SMU), and in the next line stated "USM has previously reported a confirmed mumps case last week." Since SMU is Southern Methodist University, but the report names the University as Southern Maine University, I have taken the liberty of changing the name to University of Southern Maine, USM, which I suspect is correct.

Please see comments about mumps activity in the United States following item [2] below. - Mod.LK

Health officials in Gallatin County, Montana are reporting on 4 mumps cases among students in Belgrade schools. All of the confirmed cases attend Belgrade High School or Belgrade Middle School.

Mumps is a viral disease characterized by swelling of the parotid or salivary glands along the face, neck, and jaw. The swelling can last from 2 to 10 days. The incubation period, (time from when you were infected to when you have symptoms) is 12-25 days. Other symptoms, in addition to the swelling around the neck and jaw, include fever, malaise (tiredness), muscle aches, and headache. Up to 25% of people with mumps may have few or no symptoms.

Mumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person. Saliva can pass from one person to another when they share straws, spoons, forks, cups, cans, bottles, and even lip gloss. Mumps is also commonly spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and a non-infected person inhales respiratory droplets that contain the virus.

If you do have mumps, you should avoid prolonged, close contact with other people until at least 5 days after your salivary glands begin to swell because you are contagious during this time.

Parents of children who may be most susceptible to mumps will be notified by staff from Gallatin City-County Health Department who will provide information and health care guidance. In most cases, students who are most susceptible to mumps are those who have not been vaccinated against the disease.

The good news is that guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control has determined that unimmunized students can return to school immediately if they are vaccinated against mumps.

Students who have religious or medical exemptions for the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine may be excluded from school for 25 days or more, depending on the course of the outbreak. But again, if students are vaccinated with the MMR vaccine they can return to school immediately.

[The state of Montana can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=4084267,35926. Gallatin County, in southern Montana, can be seen on the map at http://geology.com/county-map/montana-county-map.gif.

From 2000 through 2012, an average of 1135 mumps cases (range: 229 to 6584) were reported annually in the United States. Large outbreaks occurred in 2006 (6584 cases) and in 2009 and 2010 (approximately 3500 cases). Outbreaks occurred primarily among previously vaccinated persons in densely populated settings (colleges and religious communities). A provisional total of 438 mumps cases were reported in 2013.

MMR vaccine is recommended routinely for all children age 12 through 15 months, with a 2nd dose at age 4 through 6 years. The 2nd dose is not a booster, but rather is intended to produce immunity in the small number of people who fail to respond to the 1st dose. 2-5% of people do not develop measles immunity after the 1st dose of vaccine. This occurs for a variety of reasons.

To protect against mumps, adults with no evidence of immunity should get 1 dose of MMR unless the adult is in a high-risk group. High-risk people need 2 doses and include healthcare personnel, international travelers, and students at post-high school educational institutions, among others (excerpted/edited from http://www.immunize.org/askexperts/experts_mmr.asp).

Mumps is no longer common in the United States, but periodic mumps outbreaks occur, particularly in winter and spring, and cases may still occur despite prior vaccination. Crowded environments, such as college classes, organized sports, or dormitories, are a major contributing factor to the spread of mumps if the virus is introduced.

80 to 90% of vaccinees will be fully protected, but those who do become infected following vaccination tend to have milder disease when exposed to the virus. If a community maintains a high vaccination rate, the risk of exposure declines too. - Mod.LK]
