The anthrax outbreak in the Bawku West District of the Upper East Region has now been contained. According to the presiding member of the area, Moses Adogpam, the health directorate has undertaken a series of [livestock] vaccination exercises as a measure of containing the disease.

Reports of the sale of anthrax infected animals to persons outside the Sapelga town of Bawku have been on the increase despite a ban placed on such activities. Moses Adogpam, in an interview with Citi News, stressed that any persons caught transporting animals out of the town will be punished.

"We are saying no transportation of 4-legged animals in and out of the district, and no carcass will be sent outside the district, so all the butchers' houses have been closed. All butchers are advised against slaughtering any animal," he stated.

Mr. Adogpam added: "The public is advised to consume only birds. The animals have been given antibiotics so they can incubate, and within a period of one week, they will be vaccinated within the Zongo areas."

"All the cattle in other areas are, however, being vaccinated, so as of now, we don't have any cases of infection," he added.

Four people have so far died after eating the carcass of an anthrax infected cow in Sapelga in the Bawku West District. 30 cattle have also been killed by the disease.

[I think that what the worthy gentleman is trying to say is that the antibiotics will stop any incubating infection in apparently healthy but infected livestock. They are giving antibiotics, but one has to wait for the antibiotic level in the blood to fall to low levels before vaccinating with live Sterne vaccine so that the follow-up vaccination will be unaffected and fully effective. With any reasonable luck, Mr. Adogpam is correct, but it is always wise to wait a minimum of 21 days following vaccination before declaring success.
