Scores of people have been taken ill due to viral fever outbreak at Puwa in Pulu VDC-3 [Mugu district, Mid-Western region] within the past one week [week ending 9 Oct 2015].

The ailing people are deprived of medical care as there are no medicines and health workers in the village. The patients are suffering from fever, headache, dizziness and nausea.

People have to walk for 2 days to reach district headquarters Gamgadhi.

"People in each household in the village are ill. It takes one and a half hours to reach the nearest health post but there are health workers and medicines. The disease is spreading day by day," said a local resident. Some of the seriously ill villagers in the area were taken to Gamgadhi while many others are languishing in the village in want of treatment.

District Health Officer Bhakta Dev Shrestha said auxiliary health workers Birendra Shahi and Hema Tshering Lama were sent to the village with medicines on Thursday morning [8 Oct 2015].

Meanwhile, the number of patients visiting the Bhojpur District Hospital [Eastern region] has increased in the past couple of days. Hospital officials said about 100 patients visit the health facility daily for treatment in the recent days. Dr Ram Kumar Yadav said most patients complained of fever, headache, sore throat, cough and running nose. He said the number of patients visiting other health facilities is also on the rise.

[The symptoms described are non-specific so that it is not possible to speculate on which etiologic agent(s) might be responsible for these cases. If these affected individuals are feeling very unwell, walking an hour and a half to the nearest health post may not be possible, with a resulting under-estimate of the number of cases and the severity of the disease. It is not clear if the individuals being seen at the Bhojpur District Hospital are being admitted or seen as outpatients. ProMED would appreciate receiving any additional information concerning these cases, and especially any laboratory results that might point to the etiology of these infections. On 10 Apr 2015 there was a previous report of unidentified illness in western Nepal with 10 deaths. Fortunately, no deaths were reported in the above report. There have been sporadic reports of outbreaks of undiagnosed febrile illness over several recent years. No further information on these outbreaks has been received.
