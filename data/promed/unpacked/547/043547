Report (06) above mentions that only 3 of 9 specimens submitted for testing
to date were positive for Marburg virus, and raises the possibility that
the other deaths [mainly in gold miners were due to another etiology.
Until more information is known about the clinical histories of the
Marburg-negative cases, it is very difficult to play armchair
diagnostician, though very tempting -- so here goes.
The clinical syndrome presented in the posting from the MSF team in Watsa
[Hemorrhagic fever, Marburg virus - Congo, DR (02) 990507162859 was one
of muscle pain, malaise, headache (day 1), followed by persistent,
non-fluctuating high fever (days 2-3), then thoracic pain, cough and
respiratory distress (day 3), followed by simple profuse diarrhea, biliary
vomiting, asthenia, polyarthralgia and anorexia (day 4), then *hemoptysis,
*bloody diarrhea, *hematemesis, agitation, profuse sweating, shock (day
5), and finally hiccoughs preceding death (days 5-6), with the overall
average course from onset of symptoms to death of approximately 6 days.
[* here & below indicates hemorrhagic signs - Mod.JW
Anecdotal reports in some of the postings included statements that the
Marburg-negative cases did not have a prominent hemorrhagic component to
their illnesses. In addition, the lack of secondary cases among family
members involved with funeral preparation (which traditionally has major
exposure to bodily fluids, and with VHF outbreaks is associated with a high
secondary attack rate in this group) raises thoughts of a non-infectious
etiology (or non person-to-person transmitted etiology).
Given their occupation as illegal miners, the possibility of toxic chemical
exposure from the mining process has been raised. Two chemical exposures
documented in gold miners, known to lead to significant disease are mercury
and cyanide. Given the acute nature of the illnesses described, one has
to think of acute poisoning rather than low level chronic poisoning.
Mercury poisoning
----------------------
Textbook descriptions of acute mercury poisoning include: chills, fever,
cough, chest tightness, shortness of breath (after inhalation exposure) and
GI disturbances including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, with acute renal
failure (if ingested). Cause of death is often due to either fulminant
pneumonia or renal failure. In the case of inhalation exposure, chest
x-rays show diffuse pulmonary infiltrates.
Cyanide poisoning
----------------------
Textbook descriptions of acute cyanide poisoning include: shortness of
breath (with a sense of suffocation, generalized weakness and malaise with
a heaviness of arms and legs, irritation of nose, mouth and throat
(secondary to inhalation). This progresses to a loss of consciousness with
diminished respiratory effort, and ultimately to death. In chronic cyanide
poisoning there are additional presentations including headaches,
dizziness, GI disturbances and other CNS symptoms.
Arsenic poisoning
----------------------
Another chemical exposure identified in the gold mining process is arsenic.
While a review of Medlines did not yield any articles on human illness
related to arsenic exposure among gold miners, there is mention of the
theoretical possibility in a working paper of the Australian Minerals and
Energy Environment Foundation -- an abstract can be found at
<http://www.ameef.com.au/publicat/occpap/occ4abs.htm>.
Textbook descriptions acute exposure to arsine gas [arsenic vapor include:
fever headache, muscle pains, nausea, vomiting, epigastrc pain, dysuria and
explosive diarrhea. As arsenic preferentially binds to red blood cells,
there is early onset of hemolytic anemia and *hemoglobinuria (blood in
urine). Profound hypoxia and cyanosis (person appears bluish around lips
and nailbeds) is also seen. Renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis
can also occur early in the course of illness. Shock and encephalopathy,
characterized by agitation and disorientation can also occur. Death is
frequently a result of intravascular collapse. Depending on the dose and
form of arsenic ingested, there can be cramping abdominal pain, diarrhea,
nausea vomiting, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), cyanosis, headache,
*hematuria (blood in urine) and weakness, in addition to hyperesthesia
(very sensitive to touch), muscle cramps, conjunctivitis, syncope (passing
out), excessive thirst, periorbital edema (swelling around the eyes),
*epistaxis (nose-bleed) and tinnitus (ringing in the ears).
Interim conclusions
------------------------
The predominance of respiratory symptoms seems more consistent with either
mercury or cyanide poisoning, albeit the more explosive nature of the
illness with a significant GI component including explosive diarrhea
suggests the possibility of arsenic poisoning. Obviously more information
is needed to try to piece together the other possible etiologies of this
"mixed epidemic"; including the possibility of mixed poisonings.
As a non-toxicologist I think I should end these musings here to avoid the
risk of making a further fool of myself, but would welcome feedback from
those toxicologists who may subscribe to ProMED-mail.
