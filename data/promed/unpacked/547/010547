The dreaded bird flu has spread to new areas of Birbhum and
Murshidabad districts of West Bengal, even as culling of the birds in
places affected by the disease continued at a slow pace.

An alert was sounded in neighbouring Bihar and Assam.

Amid the alarm bells, the Centre asked the West Bengal government to
take immediate corrective steps to stop the spread of the disease.

"We have asked the West Bengal government to take corrective action
in every city and village," Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar told
reporters in Delhi.

The minister claimed that there was no major impact on the market.
The Health Ministry asked the state to adopt quarantine measures to
prevent transport of people, animals and birds from the bird-flu-hit
areas of Birbhum and south Dinajpur.

The fallout was felt in neighbouring Bhutan, which banned import of
poultry and poultry products from India for an indefinite period. The
ban came into effect on Wednesday [16 Jan 2008].

Bangladesh has been identified as the source of the outbreak of bird
flu in south Dinajpur, one of the 2 affected districts in West
Bengal, a senior Animal Husbandry official said.

"The germs were brought by winds blowing from Bangladesh," Assistant
Commissioner of the Central Animal Husbandry department Sujit Dutta
said in Balurghat, the headquarters of south Dinajpur [HPAI virus
introduction by winds, though not impossible, seems rather remote;
more likely, the virus might have spread by infected animals or
contaminated humans, utensils or animal feed. Such breaches of
biosecurity call for enhanced control measures. - Mod.AS].

Dutta said that the Centre is constantly monitoring the situation in
the district.

The BSF guarding the Indo-Bangla border in the district has been
alerted to ensure that no poultry products could enter from
Bangladesh, Inspector General of Police (North Bengal) R J S Nalwa said.

The administration of Siliguri subdivision of Darjeeling district has
decided to immediately stop import of chickens, chicks and eggs to
Siliguri from outside and continue checks for sick birds, SDO Smita
Pandey said.

Culling operations continue for the 2nd day on Thursday [17 Jan 2008]
in Bengal. Close to 9000 birds were culled on Wednesday [16 Jan 2008]
by the Rapid Response Teams in the core districts of Birbhum and Dinajpur.

The impact of the bird flu scare has spread far beyond the state
capital Kolkata. They have a target of culling 3.5 lakh [350 000]
birds in the next 10 days.

Chicken has been taken off the menu on all flights leaving Kolkata.
The capital is on guard, with the government doing whatever it can to
make sure there is no spread of infection, but Chief Minister Sheila
Dikshit has said there is no need to panic.

Ghazipur Mandi in East Delhi is the largest wholesale poultry market
in the city. And with the bird flu scare in the air, efforts are on
to make sure there is no infection here. Five veterinary experts have
been put on duty to certify all chicken as fit for sale.

The government claims to be taking all precautionary steps to prevent
the virus from entering Delhi and that they are being supported by
traders and shopkeepers who suffered severe losses 2 years back when
the bird flu scare hit the capital.

''As a precaution, we have got the powders and spray for the
cullination of chicken so that it is not used by anyone. This all is
being done in the supervision of our doctors. You can see, we are
already on the site. We will help people in any which way,'' said
Babu Khan Salmani, Health Official, Delhi Government.

The government has issued a set of do's and don'ts to shopkeepers
selling poultry products and also warned of surprise checks.
