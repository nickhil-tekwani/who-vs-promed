The Direction General d'almentation, Bureau of Animal Health has
announced in a press release (on the Internet site of the Ministry of
Agriculture) dated 22 Aug 2008 that:

"The confirmation of new cases of bluetongue BTV 8 due to viral
circulation in 2008 in the departments of the Ardeche, the Ardennes,
Aube, IIle et Villaine, the Lot, the Meuse, Haut Rhin, the Savoie,
Yvelines and the Essonne have caused extensions of the perimeter zones.

The confirmation of new cases of bluetongue serotype 1 in Ariege,
Haute Garonne, the Gironde and the Lot et Garonne have caused a
modification in the perimeter zones.

The establishment of vaccination against serotype 8 in the
departments of Gers, Landes, the Pyrenees Atlantiques and the Hautes
Pyrenees has brought these departments into the regulated zones
against BTV-1 and BTV-8.

The establishment of these zones was instituted by decree on 22 Aug
2008 and defined the regulated zones relative to bluetongue. The full
text is anticipated on 23 Aug 2008.

The actual list of regulated communes will be sent by post.

5621 cases of bluetongue BTV-8 in 2008 have come from viral
circulation in 2008. 74 new cases of bluetongue BTV-1 have come from
viral circulation in 2008;

15 569 cases of BTV were declared in 2007 (3 cases of BTV-1).

6020 cases of bluetongue were declared in the 1st 6 months of 2008 (6
cases of BTV-1 came from viral circulation of 2007).

[Some of the departments were mention in previous postings, and some
appear to be new. Thus, it is a bit difficult to discern the extent
of the outbreak at the present time. Please see Mod.AS's comments in
Bluetongue - Europe (44): Switzerland, France 20080820.259 for
further elaboration on this difficulty. - Mod.PC]

The Government Veterinary Authorities in the Basque country have
stated that for the 1st time BTV serotype 1 is in circulation in the
Province of Vizcaya. At the moment, the laboratory results of the LCV
at Algete (National Reference Laboratory for Bluetongue) has
officially confirmed the presence (of the disease) in 4 locations in
the province. There are also 13 other farms with preliminary positive
results in the Neiker Animal Health Laboratory and clinical suspicion
of the disease in another 20 farms. In 2 of the farms affected, the
animals are sheep, and in the rest of the suspected farms, cattle. In
all the cases, the animals were not vaccinated.

The 1st focal points of bluetongue serotype 1 in 2008 appeared in the
middle of the month of July 2008 in the regions neighboring the
autonomous communities of the Principality of Asturias and Cantabria,
clinically affecting not only sheep, but signs of the disease were
also detected in cattle, which had fever, depression, dejection [can
also mean falling over or maybe weakness - Mod.PC], lameness, intense
salivation, ulcers in the mucous membranes, conjunctivitis etc.

Since July 2008, Austrias has notified a total of 45 locations of BTV
serotype 1: 10 of sheep, 33 of cattle and 2 [farms of a mixture of
both species - Mod.PC], affecting, for the moment, the middle of the
western part of the autonomous community.

During the same period, Cantabria has notified 33 locations of
BTV-serotype 1. Three of these are sheep, and the rest cattle or a
mixture of species. The disease has spread principally in an easterly
direction, traversing the entire autonomous community to the Basque
country, where the last focal points of the disease were located.

In the south of Spain, where the virus entered from Morocco in July
of last year [2007], for the moment, serotype 1 has not been detected
since 2007.

The vaccination campaign is being intensified to stop the virus in
restricted zones and facilitate the movement (of livestock) from
restricted zones to free zones.

[The location on the north coast of Spain of the provinces involved,
including Vizcaya, Asturias and Cantabria, can be seen at
<http://encarta.msn.com/map_701512808/guernica.html>.
This is a beautiful section of Spain's north coast in the Basque area
centered around Bilbao and Santander. It is not completely surprising
to see BTV-1 here, as it has already been identified in the French
Pyrenees Atlantiques department since November 2007.
