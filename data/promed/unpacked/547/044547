Testing has confirmed a deadly disease among fish in 2 more New York
lakes following an outbreak of viral hemorrhagic septicemia, or VHS,
in Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River, according to the state
Department of Environmental Conservation.
Relatively common in continental Europe and Japan, the virus causes
internal bleeding in fish but is believed to pose no threat to
humans. It has now been confirmed in eastern Lake Erie and Conesus
Lake in western New York, where small groups of dead fish washed up
on shore, the DEC said.
VHS was first confirmed in New York in May 2006, linked to the death
of thousands of fish in eastern Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence,
including many round gobies and some muskellunge. More recently, it
killed walleye in Conesus Lake.
The virus has been confirmed also in burbot, smallmouth bass,
pumpkinseed, rock bass, bluntnose minnow, and emerald shiner in
infected New York waters, though it was not clear whether this virus
strain will affect trout and salmon, the agency said.
Other New York waterways will be tested as well, DEC spokeswoman
Maureen Wren said.
The DEC warned against bringing fish from one lake to another, noting
it's illegal without a permit, and said bait fish should be used only
in the water they came from.
On 24 Oct 2006, the U.S. Department of Agriculture prohibited
importing from Ontario and Quebec and interstate movement of live
fish from 8 states bordering the Great Lakes, including New York,
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Viral hemorrhagic septicemia affects rainbow trout, brown trout,
brook trout, grayling, white fish (_Coregonus_ sp.), pike, and
turbot. A number of marine species are also susceptible, including
Pacific herring, Pacific salmon (_Oncorhynchus_ spp.), Pacific cod,
Pacific sandlance, and pilchard. In the Atlantic Ocean, susceptible
species include Atlantic Cod, haddock, poor cod, rockling, sprat,
herring, whiting, blue whiting, lesser argentine, Norway pout, shiner
perch, Dab, English sole, flounder, and plaice. Most warmwater fish
are resistant to this disease.
Viral hemorrhagic septicemia is highly contagious; quarantines are
necessary to control outbreaks. VHSV can survive for long periods in
the bottom of farm ponds, possibly in protozoans or metazoans, if the
ponds are not dried and disinfected.
VHSV can be inactivated by formalin, drying, iodophor disinfectants,
sodium hydroxide, sodium hypochlorite, and pH 2.5 or 12.2. The virus
is also highly thermolabile. The effectiveness of lime disinfection
is suspect. - Mod.TG]
