West Nile Patients May Have Lingering Problems
----------------------------------------------
NEW YORK: Although most people infected with West Nile virus experience
mild symptoms or no symptoms, those who develop the most serious form of
the disease may have lingering problems, researchers say. Less than 40
percent of people hospitalized for the infection are back in top form one
year later, said Dr. Denis Nash, the scientific director of HIV/AIDS
Surveillance at the New York City Department of Health. "The one big
message is that it's not just a transient illness in people who become
hospitalized with neurologic complications," said Nash. "For a lot of
people, especially elderly patients, but even the younger ones, this
severely affects their quality of life for a long time."
Nash and his colleagues recently presented the results of a new study, part
of a collaborative effort between the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and the New York City Department of Health, at the annual
meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, held in San
Francisco, California.
The researchers conducted telephone interviews with 42 New York residents
hospitalized with West Nile virus infections during an outbreak in 1999. At
that time, 5 out of a total of 59 patients who were similarly hospitalized
in the New York area died from their infections. Nash told Reuters Health
that in approximately 1 out of 150 cases, complications result that
compromise the central nervous system and result in hospitalization. All
the patients his team interviewed were among this more serious group. Nash
and colleagues concluded that 37 percent of the patients had fully
recovered from their infection, while between 45 and 60 percent had
recovered some of their impaired physical and mental capacities. The
researchers determined that despite having been released from hospital,
many patients were still battling the disabling effects of their illness
even one year after initial infection, with older age associated with a
greater difficulty in recovering.
Nash stressed that the research team had not assessed the patients' health
prior to infection, so they had to rely on the patient's memory and
pre-existing conditions listed in medical records to assess how healthy the
patients had been before hospitalization. Nevertheless, Nash told Reuters
Health that the findings clearly illustrate that for those patients with
the most serious form of the infection, getting back on their feet is not
an easy task. "The risk of contracting a clinical case of West Nile virus
enough to cause hospitalization is very low, but if it does happen it can
have serious long-term consequences," he said. "You don't leave the
hospital and recover in a couple of weeks."
