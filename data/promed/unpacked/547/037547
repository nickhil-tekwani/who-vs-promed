Indonesia: 15 blood samples declared free of avian influenza virus
------------------------------------------------------------------
15 blood samples taken by a Health Ministry team from the relatives and
neighbors of an avian influenza victim have tested negative for the virus,
a provincial health official said here on Mon 19 Sep 2005. "An examination
conducted by the Health Ministry's research and development unit on samples
of the blood of the woman's relatives and neighbors last Tuesday [13 Sep
2005] has shown them to be free of the virus," Budihardja, head of the
Central Java Health Office, said.
The 37 year old woman died at the Bintaro International Hospital in South
Jakarta on Saturday [10 Sep 2005]. Tests done on samples of her body fluids
at the WHO laboratory in Hong Kong later showed she had carried the avian
influenza virus. She had been admitted to the hospital on 6 Sep 2005 for
acute pneumonia. Budihardja said the 15 blood samples included those taken
from 3 people who had helped to bury the woman. "I contacted the Ministry
in Jakarta and was told all the 15 blood samples had tested negative (for
the avian flu virus)," he said. Budihardja said he had informed the woman's
family about the result of the tests in Jakartam, which had confirmed that
the virus is not transmitted from human to human.
The woman was the 4th person in Indonesia who had died of bird flu, after a
man and 2 of his daughters died last July [2005]. [WHO has stated that that
H5N1 infection was confirmed in the 38 year old father, but laboratory test
results for his 2 daughters did not meet criteria for acute H5N1
infections. - Mod.CP]. Meanwhile, the Sulianti Saroso Hospital in north
Jakarta is reported to be treating 2 children suspected of having
contracted the virus.

Indonesia: Jakarta declared an "extraordinary case region"
----------------------------------------------------------
The government has declared Jakarta as an "extraordinary case region" for
avian influenza, following the outbreak of the avian influenza virus in the
Indonesian capital, a cabinet member said. Minister of health Mrs Siti
Fadilah Supari made the statement after attending a coordination meeting to
face the outbreak of the bird flu at the Coordinating Ministry of People's
Welfare office here on Sunday [18 Sep 2005] night.
Earlier, Tangerang, near Jakarta, had been declared an extraordinary case
region following the death of a father and his 2 daughters as a result of
avian influenza [the deaths of the 2 daughters have not been confirmed as
due to avian influenza virus infection. - Mod.CP]. Some 19 fowl in the
Ragunan Zoo have been declared infected by the avian influenza virus,
causing Jakarta governor Sutiyoso to close the zoo for 21 days as of Monday
[19 Sep 2005].
In the meantime, there are 3 people who were allegedly infected by bird flu
and who are now receiving medical treatment, while another is still under
observation. To limit the spread, the ministry will intensify surveillance,
strengthen laboratory capabilities, promote biosecurity, enhance management
of cases treatment and boost communication, information and education.
The government will also prepare a collaborating center in Indonesia,
because, for confirmation, the country has, so far, had to refer [samples]
to the University of Hong Kong's laboratory, she added. There are
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [diagnostic facilities?] in 8 provinces in
Indonesia, among others, in North Sumatra, Jakarta, West Java, East Java,
South Sulawesi, and West Nusa Tenggara. "The laboratories cannot carry out
detailed diagnostic [tests], so they must refer the cases to the University
of Hong Kong's laboratory," the minister said.

[Failure to detect avian influenza virus in blood samples from 15 close
relatives and neighbors of the most recent fatal case in Jakarta indicates
that the virus does not easily spread from person to person. However, the
nature and sensitivity of the tests are unclear. The source of infection of
the latest victim remains obscure. - Mod.CP]
