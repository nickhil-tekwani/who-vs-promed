Since March 2009, a growing number of cases of hand, foot, and mouth
disease (HFMD) have been reported in parts of Asia, including China,
Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. HFMD is common among infants and
children, and most of the recently reported cases have occurred in
children.

The disease is very contagious and is spread through contact with the
body fluids of an infected person, such as droplets from coughs and
sneezes, saliva, blister fluid, or stool.

China
-----
On 10 Apr 2009, China's Ministry of Health Information Office reported
that 54 713 cases of HFMD had been detected through the end of March
2009. Most of these cases were in rural areas. The provinces and
regions most affected by this outbreak are the central provinces of
Henan, Jiangsu, Guangxi, Anhui, Guangdong, Hebei, Hunan, Zhejiang,
Hubei, and the eastern province of Shandong. As of 30 Mar 2009, the
Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC)
confirmed that at least 19 children have died from HFMD this year
[2009].

The Chinese government has enhanced its surveillance, prevention, and
control activities, along with training of local medical staff to
identify and report cases promptly.

Hong Kong S.A.R.
----------------
As of 27 Mar 2009, the Center for Health Protection of Hong Kong has
confirmed one case of HFMD. Nine other children who were exposed at
the nursery where the ill child attended also developed HFMD symptoms.
This is the 7th case reported to the Center for Health Protection of
Hong Kong this year [2009].

Singapore
---------
As of 11 Apr 2009, Singapore's Ministry of Health has reported 5471
cases of HFMD infections this year [2009]. Typically, Singapore
experiences annual peaks of HFMD from March to May.

Taiwan
------
As of 31 Mar 2009, the Taiwan Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (Taiwan CDC) has reported 9 cases of HFMD with severe
complications, all in children under 5 years of age. Two cases each
were located in the northern and central area of Taiwan, and 5
additional cases were located in the southern area of Taiwan.

In response to the growing number of reports of HFMD, other countries
in the Western Pacific have increased surveillance for HFMD. When
available, further information on this evolving situation will be
posted as an update to this notice.

Advice for Travelers
--------------------
No vaccine is available to prevent HFMD. There is no specific
treatment for people who are sick with this disease other than
treating symptoms, such as fever. If you are sick and have fever while
you are traveling, be aware that some countries treat fever with a
class of medicine called pyrazolone that is banned in the United
States due to harmful side effects. This medicine may even be
available over-the-counter. CDC does not recommend using this class of
medicine to treat fever.

In general, because in some countries there is a risk that medications
you buy will be counterfeit, CDC recommends that you bring with you
all the medications that you think you will need during your trip. You
should consider taking fever medicine with you to treat any symptoms
if you plan to travel to any of these countries. Travelers can take
steps to prevent getting HFMD by practicing good personal hygiene. If
you are traveling, especially to areas where HFMD has been reported,
follow these tips for good health:

- Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially before you
eat, after you cough or sneeze, and after you go to the bathroom. If
soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand gel (with
at least 60 percent alcohol). Consider packing alcohol-based hand gel
in your luggage to ensure you have it when needed.
- Do not share eating utensils, such as forks, spoons, and cups.

Adults should help child travelers to follow these recommendations.
Infants, children, and adolescents are more susceptible to HFMD.

HFMD is an illness caused by certain enterovirus strains, including
EV71 [enterovirus 71], which are common worldwide. Outbreaks of HFMD
caused by EV71 are common and have been reported by countries
throughout the Asia-Pacific region in recent years. EV71 can be spread
from person to person by direct contact with nose and throat
secretions (e.g., by coughing or sneezing), saliva, fluid from
blisters, or the stool of infected persons. People who are sick with
HFMD often experience symptoms such as fever, sores in the mouth, and
a rash, occasionally with blisters. HFMD caused by EV71 may sometimes
lead to serious complications, including swelling of the brain
(encephalitis). Most cases of HFMD occur in children under 10 years of
age, but adults can also become infected.
