Dozens of grackles that fell out of the sky last month [August 2013] in Winnipeg's North End had been exposed to a chemical in pest control products, according to the Manitoba government.

Toxicology tests on the dead birds found evidence of anticholinesterase, provincial officials announced Thursday [19 Sep 2013].

Anticholinesterase, a chemical that affects the nervous system, is commonly used in products for controlling pests.

At least 50 of the black birds were found dead near the intersection of King Street and Dufferin Avenue in early August [2013], puzzling people who live and work in the area.

It's not known exactly how the birds were exposed to the pest control material.

Earlier test results had ruled out West Nile virus, avian influenza, and Newcastle disease as causes of the bird deaths.

While grackles are not protected under Manitoba's Wildlife Act, the province says it is monitoring wild birds to curb the spread of avian flu and other viruses.

[Anticholinesterases most commonly used as pesticides are organophosphates (OPs). They cause the inhibition of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). AChE is critical for nerve function, so the irreversible blockage of this enzyme, which causes acetylcholine accumulation, results in muscle overstimulation. Organophosphate poisoning most commonly results from exposure to insecticides or nerve agents. OPs are one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, and are frequently intentionally used in suicides in agrarian areas.
