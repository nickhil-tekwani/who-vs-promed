Outbreak of West Nile-Like Viral Encephalitis -- New York, 1999
---------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of arboviral encephalitis was first recognized in New York City
in late August and has since been identified in neighboring counties in New
York state. Although initially attributed to St. Louis encephalitis (SLE)
virus based on positive serologic findings in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and
serum samples using a virus-specific IgM-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA), the cause of the outbreak has been confirmed as a West
Nile-like virus based on the identification of virus in human, avian, and
mosquito samples.
On August 23, 1999, an infectious disease physician from a hospital in
northern Queens contacted the New York City Department of Health (NYCDOH) to
report two patients with encephalitis. On investigation, NYCDOH initially
identified a cluster of six patients with encephalitis, five of whom had
profound muscle weakness (with axonal neuropathy by electromyelogram and
requiring respiratory support [n=four). Testing of these initial cases by
IgM-capture ELISA for antibodies to the common North American arboviruses
was positive for SLE virus on September 3 at CDC. Eight of the earliest
case-patients were residents of a 2-by-2-mile area in northern Queens. On
the basis of these findings, aerial and ground applications of mosquito
adulticides and larvacides were instituted in northern Queens and South
Bronx on September 3.
To define the geographic extent of the outbreak, NYCDOH initiated active
surveillance on August 30, and the Westchester County Department of Health
and the Nassau County Department of Health initiated active surveillance on
September 3. Surveillance is also ongoing in surrounding areas.
A clinical case is defined as a presumptive diagnosis of viral encephalitis
with or without muscle weakness or acute flaccid paralysis, Guillain-Barre
syndrome, aseptic meningitis, or presence of the clinical syndrome
characterizing the initial cluster of cases in a patient presenting after
August 1.
Before and concurrent with this outbreak, local health officials observed
increased fatalities among New York City birds, especially crows. During
September 7-9, officials of the Bronx Zoo noted the deaths of a cormorant,
two captive-bred Chilean flamingoes, and an Asian pheasant. Necropsies
performed on these birds at the zoo revealed varying degrees of
meningo-encephalitis and severe myocarditis. Tissue specimens from these
birds and a crow with pathologic evidence of encephalitis from New York
state were sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Veterinary
Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, on September 10 to be tested for
common avian pathogens and the equine encephalitis viruses; all tests were
negative. NVSL isolated viruses from the birds' tissues and forwarded them
to CDC on September 20 for identification and characterization.
Testing at CDC on September 23 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA
sequencing of these isolates indicated that they were closely related to
West Nile virus (WNV), which has never been isolated in the western
hemisphere. In other tests at CDC, flavivirus antigen was detected in one of
the autopsy specimens by immunohistochemistry, and a West Nile-like virus
genomic sequence identical to that derived from the bird isolates was
observed in a human brain specimen from an encephalitis case. Concurrently,
specimens of brain tissue from three human encephalitis cases, forwarded by
the New York State Department of Health to the University of California,
Irvine, were reported as positive for West Nile-like virus sequence by
genomic analysis. All serum/CSF specimens reactive to SLE by IgM ELISA were
positive by WNV ELISA with higher positive/negative ratios than to SLE, and
an additional 10 borderline and eight negative samples were positive for
antibody to WNV.
As of September 28, a total of 17 confirmed and 20 probable human cases (1)
and four deaths have been reported from New York City (25 cases) and the
surrounding counties of Westchester (eight) and Nassau (four). The four
deaths occurred among persons aged greater than or equal to 68 years.
One case-patient with onset in late August reported a history of travel to
Africa completed in June 1999; none of the remaining case-patients had
traveled during the incubation period to areas where WNV is known to be
endemic. Two of the Westchester County case-patients had no reported travel
history to New York City or other areas in which WNV previously had been
detected.
Onset dates ranged from August 5 to September 16 (Figure 1), although no
cases had onset in New York City after control measures were extended to the
entire city on September 11. The median age of case-patients was 71 years
(range: 15-87 years), with the most severe clinical cases and all fatalities
occurring among older persons.
Vector control measures initiated in northern Queens and South Bronx on
September 3 were followed by a city-wide pesticide application after
laboratory confirmation of encephalitis in a Brooklyn resident with no
travel history to Queens and confirmation of an additional two cases in
South Bronx. According to the latest ongoing population estimates from a
city-wide mosquito surveillance program, the host-seeking adult Culex
pipiens mosquito population has been reduced substantially by the control
operation. Following the confirmation of human cases in Westchester and
Nassau counties and detection of virus in adult Culex pipiens and Aedes
vexans mosquitoes and in a deceased bird from a nearby area in Connecticut,
insecticide application has been initiated in these areas to reduce the
mosquito population. Surveillance of wild birds and/or sentinel chickens was
instituted to assess WNV distribution in the region.
Emergency telephone hotlines were established in New York City on September
3 and in Westchester County on September 21 to address public inquiries
about the encephalitis outbreak and pesticide application. As of September
28, approximately 130,000 calls have been received by the New York City
hotline and 12,000 by the WCDH hotline. Approximately 300,000 cans of
DEET-based mosquito repellant were distributed citywide through local
firehouses, and 750,000 public health leaflets were distributed with
information about personal protection against mosquito bites. Recurring
public messages were announced on radio, television, on the New York City
and WCDH World-Wide Web sites, and in newspapers, urging personal protection
against mosquito bites, including limiting outdoor activity during peak
hours of mosquito activity, wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants,
using DEET-based insect repellents, and eliminating any potential mosquito
breeding niches. Spraying schedules also were publicized with
recommendations for persons to remain indoors while spraying occurred to
reduce pesticide exposure. Mosquito surveillance will continue until the
first frost in New York City; Westchester, Nassau, Rockland, and Suffolk
counties; and Connecticut. Surveillance for new human WNV cases will be
conducted until several weeks after the first frost, when mosquito activity
is expected to subside.

MMWR Editorial Note:
------------------------------
WNV is a flavivirus belonging taxonomically to the Japanese encephalitis
subgroup that includes the serologically closely related SLE virus, Kunjin
virus, Murray Valley encephalitis virus, and others. WNV was first isolated
in the West Nile Province of Uganda in 1937 (2). The first recorded
epidemics occurred in Israel during 1950-1954 and in 1957. Epidemics have
been reported in Europe in the Rhone delta of France in 1962 and in Romania
in 1996 (3-5). The largest recorded epidemic occurred in South Africa in
1974 (6). It is unclear whether the virus that caused this outbreak is a
previously identified strain of WNV or a new variant.
The genomic sequences identified to date from a human brain, virus isolates
from zoo birds, and viruses isolated from a dead crow and two mosquito pools
from Connecticut appear identical.
Based on preliminary serologic testing, this outbreak was originally
believed to be caused by the SLE virus. SLE and West Nile viruses are
antigenically related, and cross reactions are observed with some serologic
tests. Results of PCR-based sequencing that identified WNV prompted more
specific testing. The IgM-capture ELISA used in testing serum/CSF samples in
this outbreak is rapid, sensitive, and quantitative. The limitations of some
serologic assays emphasize the importance of isolating the flavivirus from
entomologic, clinical, or veterinary material. The availability of virus
isolates and genomic sequences from birds and human brain tissue permitted
the discovery of this West Nile-like virus in North America. Although it is
not known when and how a West Nile-like virus was introduced into North
America, international travel of infected persons to New York or transport
by imported infected birds may have played a role.
WNV can infect a wide range of vertebrates, but in humans it usually
produces either asymptomatic infection or mild febrile disease. Within its
normal geographic distribution of Africa, the Middle East, western Asia, and
Europe, WNV has not been documented to cause epizootics in birds; crows with
antibodies to WNV are common, suggesting that asymptomatic or mild infection
usually occurs among crows in those regions. Similarly, substantial bird
virulence of SLE virus has not been reported. Therefore, an epizootic
producing high mortality in crows and other bird species is unusual for
either WNV or SLE virus and may represent introduction to a native bird
population or a new virulent strain. For both viruses, migratory birds may
play an important role in the natural transmission cycles.
Like SLE virus, WNV is transmitted principally by _Culex_ species
mosquitoes, but also can be transmitted by _Aedes_, _Anopheles_, and other
species. The predominance of urban _Culex_ mosquitoes trapped during this
outbreak suggests an important role for this species. Enhanced monitoring
through surveillance for early detection of this virus outside of the
affected area will be crucial to guide extension of control measures.
