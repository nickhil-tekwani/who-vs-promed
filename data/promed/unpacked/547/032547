Scientists at the Universities of Goettingen and Freiburg in
Breisgau, as well as at the Pforzheim Clinical Center have for the
1st time confirmed [the occurrence of] the Toscana virus in Baden-Wurttemberg.

The virus, probably transmitted by sandflies and originating from the
Mediterranean region, can cause mild meningitis which improves after
a few days.

The researchers examined various cases of undiagnosed inflammation
[meningitis] cases from previous years. It was found that 10 persons
who had not been in southern Europe during the previous 14 days had,
nonetheless, developed antibodies against the virus. The virus
incubation period is 2 weeks.

[This is the 1st report of aseptic meningitis cases caused by Toscana
virus in Germany. Toscana virus was first isolated from a sandfly
(_Phlebotomus perniciosus_) in central Italy in 1971. The following
abstract provides a summary of Toscana virus:

"Toscana virus (TOSV) is an arthropod-borne virus which is
transmitted to humans by _Phlebotomus_ spp sandflies. Infection is
the cause of brain injuries, such as aseptic meningitis and
meningoencephalitis, in Italy mainly during the summer. More recently
some unusual clinical manifestations due to TOSV with severe
sequelae, such as ischemic complications and hydrocephalus, have been
reported. TOSV represents an important emerging pathogen and its
presence is being investigated in several European countries on the
Mediterranean basin, including Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, and
Cyprus. Phylogenetic analysis has distinguished 2 genotypes of TOSV,
A and B; the 1st is circulating mainly in Italy and the 2nd in Spain,
indicating a different geographic distribution possibly related to
the vector. This distribution, evolving with the climate,
globalization and habitat modification, has implications for the
epidemiology of TOSV."
