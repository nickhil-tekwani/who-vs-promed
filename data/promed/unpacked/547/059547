Bird flu has hit the southern province of Dong Thap for the 2nd time
this year, according to Viet Nam's Animal Health Department. The
province, which was declared free of the virus several weeks ago,
reported fresh outbreaks in Tan Hoi Trung Commune in Cao Lanh
District, said department officials yesterday [18 Jul 2007].
Tests confirmed the deadly H5N1 strain was responsible for killing
120 chickens on 4 farms. Local veterinarians have slaughtered the
remaining 280 birds and disinfected the sites.
Officials were worried because these chickens were already vaccinated
against the virus, said provincial authorities. They are currently
conducting an investigation to find out whether the birds were given
a faulty vaccine or were perhaps missed.
Another commune in the northern province of Dien Bien also reported a
new outbreak of bird flu on Monday [16 Jul 2007], despite the fact
that the area was not considered a high-risk region, said Hoang Van
Nam, deputy head of the department. Bird flu was responsible for the
deaths of 120 ducks in Noong Het Commune, located in Dien Bien
District. The remaining ducks were slaughtered and the farm was
sprayed to prevent the virus' return, said department officials.
With fresh outbreaks in Dong Thap, the number of bird flu-infected
provinces remains at 6, with Nghe An Province the latest removed from
the list.
In addition, Bac Giang, Thai Binh, and Ca Mau Provinces are also well
on their way to clearing their names as they approach the 21-day
period without a fresh occurrence of the virus. At a meeting with the
National Steering Committee for Avian Flu Control and Prevention on
Tuesday [17 Jul 2007] in Ha Noi, delegates discussed the importance
of vaccinating all poultry.
Tony Forman, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)
representative in the country, said it was an important way to fight
bird flu in Viet Nam. The FAO recommended that poultry farmers comply
with department regulations on vaccinating their flocks and closely
monitor the illegal trafficking of waterfowl.
The organisation commended the Government for its recent orders to
close egg hatcheries and slaughterhouses that fail to meet food
safety and sanitation standards.
