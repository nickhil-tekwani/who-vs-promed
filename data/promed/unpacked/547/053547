More than 80 wild and domestic rabbits across 9 Wyoming counties have died as a result of a highly contagious and lethal rabbit hemorrhagic disease called RHDV2.

While wildlife officials continue to track the disease, it is not considered an epidemic yet, according to Sara DiRienzo, a public information officer for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.

Department officials tracked Wyoming's rabbit population as the disease surfaced in 10 other western states last summer [2020], but no sign of it was detected in Wyoming until December [2020] when a wild eastern cottontail rabbit in Albany County was found to be infected.

As of July [2021], 83 dead rabbits have been reported, DiRienzo said. Of the rabbit carcasses testing positive for the disease, 9 were black-tailed jackrabbits and 74 were cottontails with the majority coming from Laramie County at 30, followed by 18 in Park and 16 in Albany counties, according to DiRienzo.

The highly contagious virus impacts all members of the Lagomorpha order, including hares, rabbits, pikas, and pygmy rabbits, and can kill up to 80% to 100% of infected animals. It is spread through direct contact with infected rabbits, feces or carcasses, which can store the hardy virus for months in their tissues.

It's not clear how RHDV2 arrived in North America and the West, after 1st being identified in France in 2010, and less than a decade later in Canada, and later North America.

As of July [2021], according to http://WildlifeHealth.org, RHDV2 has been confirmed in wild rabbits in 11 states throughout the U.S. including Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Montana and Oregon in black-tailed jackrabbits, desert and mountain cottontails, antelope jackrabbit, and eastern cottontails.

The disease does not impact humans or other livestock or animals. Humans, however, can play a part in transmitting the virus by carrying it on their clothing or shoes.

The virus is resistant to extreme temperatures and can to survive for extended periods.

Given the relatively small number of cases in Wyoming thus far, DiRienzo said it's far from being considered an epidemic, although the Game and Fish Department is carefully monitoring and tracking the spread of the disease in order to mitigate impact on wild and domestic rabbit populations, which could have lasting ramifications on the food chain and lead to other disruptions in the natural world.

Of concern in Wyoming in particular, DiRienzo said, are the already vulnerable populations of pygmy rabbits, cotton tails, hares, and pikas.

"As a food base, it could definitely have an impact on other creatures on top of what the rabbit species have to contend with in general like plague and other diseases," she said.

Domestic rabbits are also vulnerable to the highly contagious viral disease, but thus far, there's only been one known case reported in Wyoming, according to Dr. Hallie Hasel, assistant state veterinarian for field operations for the Wyoming Livestock Board.

To that end, Hasel suggested owners of domestic rabbit pets fence them off from exposure to wild rabbits. Worrisome for Hasel and others is the capability of the disease to spread so rapidly and seemingly without control.

Little is known about the virus and why it is so instantly lethal and contagious to rabbits in particular, she said. Subtle signs a rabbit might be infected include fever, respiratory distress, loss of appetite or other nervous system abnormalities like loss of coordination or convulsions. Infected animals which die of the disease will typically have blood-stained noses and mouths due to internal bleeding.

There's no treatment for the RHDV2 nor is there an FDA-approved vaccine, though one is currently in the works, but a vaccine is available in Europe which several Wyoming clinics have on hand.

DiRienzo said the public has been of tremendous help in locating and reporting dead rabbits to the Game and Fish Department and she encourages people to continue reporting any dead rabbit carcasses they find whether in their yards or while out on a hike. Those reporting are advised not to touch the dead animal, but rather to report it to their local Game and Fish Department office. Staffers will then pick up the rabbit and take it back to the lab for sampling, DiRienzo said.

A map of impacted counties is available on the WGFD website (https://wgfd.wyo.gov/Wildlife-in-Wyoming/More-Wildlife/Wildlife-Disease/Wildlife-Disease-Information/Rabbit-Hemorrhagic-Disease-Virus-2-(RHDV2)).

["Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV) is a highly contagious disease caused by a calicivirus that affects rabbits. This includes wild and domesticated European rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_), from which our own domesticated rabbits are descended. Until 2020, it had not been known to affect North American native rabbits or hares, such as cottontails, snowshoe hares, and jackrabbits. In the 2020-2021 United States and Mexico and Canada outbreak, RHDV is causing death in wildlife species of rabbits as well.

"RHDV was first seen in China in 1984 but was thought to have originated in Europe. There have been confirmed cases in 40 countries, including in Europe, the Mediterranean, Africa, Asia, North America (Mexico, United States, Canada), Australia, and New Zealand.

"RHDV2, a new virus, emerged in France in 2010, and quickly spread in Europe and the Mediterranean, and has replaced the original strain in many countries. In 2015, RHDV2 was first detected in Australia -- it spread coast-to-coast in the rabbit population in 18 months (approximately 3 million square miles, compared to United States' approximately 3.8 million square miles) and became the dominant strain replacing RHDV1.

"Signs may include:
- Loss of appetite
- Lethargy
- High fever
- Seizures
- Jaundice
- Bleeding from nose, mouth, or rectum
- Difficulty breathing
- Sudden death

"RHDV is often a very swift and sudden killer, giving little warning. Rabbits may die without showing any symptoms at all. Any sudden rabbit death is suspicious and should be reported to your veterinarian as a possible case of RHDV.
Incubation period
- RHDV1 1-3 days. Rabbits may die within 12-36 hours to a few weeks, after the onset of symptoms.
- RHDV2 3-5 days. Previous experimental RHDV2 infection found incubation of 3-9 days until onset of symptoms, then death within 3-5 days.
Death rate (mortality)
- RHDV1 40-100%
- RHDV2 5-80%+. In the 2020 Southwest US and Mexico RHDV2 outbreak, officials report a death rate of about 90%.
Survivors
Rabbits who survive RHDV are carriers and shed the virus for at least 42 days, perhaps longer.
Asymptomatic carriers
Some rabbits may have little to no symptoms of RHDV2 (subclinical/asymptomatic) but may shed virus for up to 2 months.
Transmission routes
Rabbits are infected by oral, nasal/respiratory, or ocular exposure to the virus, or by blood-feeding insects.
- Cause of death: RHDV causes necrotizing hepatitis, and may cause necrosis of the spleen. There may be internal or externally visible bleeding. Death occurs from liver failure or hemorrhage due to an impairment in the blood's ability to clot.
Durability of virus
Rabbit calicivirus is a very hardy virus, remaining viable in the environment outside a host.
- Survives 105 days at 68 degrees F on fabric - it remains stable for 3.5 months at room temperature
- Survives 225 days at 39 degrees F (just above freezing temperatures)
- Survives freeze/thaw cycles
- Survives heat of 122 degrees F for one hour
Seasonal outbreaks
Where the virus has a reservoir in wild rabbits or feral/stray domestic rabbits, seasonal outbreaks are expected year to year. In Australia, outbreaks start in fall and winter, peak in spring, and are mostly absent in summer. Seasonal fly abundance, as flies are a significant vector, may be linked with RHDV activity.
Treatment
- There is no known cure for RHDV
- RHDV treatment is supportive care in isolation
- There are currently no known effective anti-viral drugs or other treatments available" https://rabbit.org/rhdv/
