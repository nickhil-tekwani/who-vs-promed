Food aid allocated to al-Dali by the World Food Program [WFP] has caused the deaths of 2 children and injured dozens more as a result of eating beans that likely gave them a deadly disease. Medical sources say that more than 20 children arrived at the hospital in critical condition, and Dr. Nabil Barti says that the cause of death was the beans, though the disease is still unknown.

Dr. Barti says that the children died of severe anemia, which reduced the effectiveness of their red blood cells by a factor of 2 or 3, followed by acute renal failure. He explained that the Health Bureau is currently investigating the WFP beans to determine the type of disease.

The WFP has begun distributing more than 18 000 food baskets in order to aid those displaced by violence in al-Dali. National Yemen contacted the WFP, which said that it takes this report very seriously and that the safety of its commodities are of paramount importance. It will investigate the claim thoroughly.

All WFP food is checked to ensure that it meets international standards, and all food is additionally certified by the Yemen Bureau of Standards. WFP is conducting an investigation in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, and to date, sees no indications that its food is hazardous.

On the other hand, the Epidemiological Monitoring Center in al-Dali said that more than 50 cases of the diseases have appeared not only in al-Dali, but also al-Azariq. Most symptoms affected children between 5-15 and consisted of fever, blood in urine, severe diarrhea, as well as anemia, according to a confidential source.

It has not been confirmed whether the beans were infected by pollution or a virus, but the source said that citizens should stop eating the beans and call the relevant authorities in the Ministry of Health to find out the truth.

The source explained that not all people may become infected, as the beans were eaten in the past to no effect. He advised waiting before making any claims on the matter.

Dr. Ameen Abeed Obasi, an internal medicine specialist at the hospital, confirmed these cases.

[The above news report describes an outbreak that has affected more than 50 children, most between 5-15 years of age, in 2 locations (al-Dali and al-Azariq) in Yemen. The illness is said by the news report to consist of fever, "blood" in urine, severe diarrhea, as well as severe anemia, that is followed by acute renal failure. Two of the affected children have died, and the illness has been attributed to eating "beans" supplied by the World Food Program.

We are not told the type of bean involved, how it was prepared, or how long after eating the beans that the illness appeared. We are told that people "in the past" who ate the beans did not become ill, but we are not told whether these unaffected people came from al-Dali or al-Azariq, their age, or whether they ate the same prepared beans as the affected children.

The description of the illness suggests an acute hemolytic crisis induced by eating fava beans in people who have Mediterranean type glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, a potentially fatal manifestation of hereditary, X-linked disorder (http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/favism#ref-2). It primarily affects males, although it can have clinical effects in homozygous females and a proportion of female heterozygous carriers. Eating fava beans in these people leads to acute, massive intravascular hemolysis that results in severe anemia, hemoglobinuria causing the passage of dark, reddish urine that may resemble blood, followed by acute renal failure. These individuals may also be susceptible to hemolytic crises induced by certain drugs (e.g., primaquine) and infections. The highest prevalence of G6PD deficiency is found in the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, tropical and subtropical Asia, Papua New Guinea, and various Mediterranean locations.

The interval between exposure to fava beans and the onset of symptoms is usually under 24 hours but may be as long as several days and is usually seen in children (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2481045/pdf/bullwho00174-0011.pdf). The predominant type of exposure associated with favism has been noted to be ingestion of fresh beans at the time of harvest and may follow ingestion of raw or cooked beans (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2481045/pdf/bullwho00174-0011.pdf).

Severe diarrhea is said to be part of the illness. Although we are not told whether the diarrhea was bloody in any of the affected children, another possible explanation for this outbreak is hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, hematuria, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure) that can develop in children 5 to 10 days after onset of bloody diarrhea due to intestinal infection with certain strains of _Escherichia coli_ that produce Shiga toxin. HUS develops in these patients at a time when the diarrhea is improving.

Bloody diarrhea will occur about 3 to 4 days after consumption of food contaminated by Shiga toxin (also known as verotoxin) producing _E. coli_ (STEC or VTEC), also referred to as enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC). EHEC are most frequently serotype O157, but other non-O157 serotypes of EHEC can also cause the illness. In 2011, a new Shiga toxin-producing EHEC strain, O104:H4, was identified as the cause of an outbreak in Germany and other countries in Europe. Primary sources of EHEC outbreaks are raw or undercooked ground meat products, raw milk and fecal contamination of raw vegetables or sprouts. Person-to-person transmission can also occur through the oral-fecal route.

However, HUS is an uncommon complication of Shiga toxin producing _E. coli_ infection; only about 5-10 percent of children with bloody diarrhea develop HUS. We are not told in the news report whether there were any children with diarrhea who did not develop severe anemia and renal failure. Also, fever is not a prominent part of the illness; fever, if it occurs, is usually less than 101 F (38.5 C). Most children with Shiga toxin producing _E. coli_ infection who do not develop HUS will recover within about 10 days.

A more detailed description of the illness, its epidemiology, and the food eaten by the affected children would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Ad Dali, also spelled Al Dali, Al Dhale or Ad Dhale'e, is the capital town and district of Ad Dali Governorate, located inland, north of the coastal city of Aden in southwestern Yemen (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_Dhale%27e_District). As of 2003, the Ad Dhale'e district had a population of 80 213 inhabitants (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_Dhale%27e_District). Residents of Al Dhale have been "caught in the crossfire between government troops and rebels fighting for the south's secession from the north," according to a news report from 1 Mar 2014 (http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/world/middleeast/un-to-assess-residents-risk-in-southern-yemen-city.html?_r=0). Al Azariq is also a district of the Ad Dali Governorate, Yemen. As of 2003, the district had a population of 37 295 inhabitants (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Azariq_District).
