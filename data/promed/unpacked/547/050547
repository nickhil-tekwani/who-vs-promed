An equine herpesvirus (EHV) 1-infected horse has been reported in Johnson County [Wyoming]. Laboratory confirmation of a Johnson County horse infected with equine herpesvirus neurologic disease, or equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM), was received by Wyoming Livestock Board (WLSB) staff veterinarians on Thu 4 Apr 2019. The horse has been quarantined to its premise in Johnson County with 19 other horses.

The affected horse began showing neurologic signs, including hind-end weakness, on Wed 3 Apr 2019. It is not known where this horse contracted the disease, but it had been at college rodeo events on 15-16 Mar [2019] at the Cam-plex in Gillette [WY] and 21-24 Mar [2019] at the Goshen County Fairgrounds in Torrington [WY].

Dr. Thach Winslow, Wyoming Assistant State Veterinarian for Field Operations, said that any horses that were at these events should be considered potentially exposed, and owners should consider taking preventative measures, including close monitoring of the horses and checking their temperatures at least twice daily. If any of these horses show neurologic signs or fever, the owner needs to isolate them and contact his/her veterinarian for advice and treatment options.

According to WLSB staff veterinarians, equine herpesviruses are very common DNA viruses in horse populations worldwide. The great majority of horses are exposed to EHV-1 -- the virus that causes EHM -- early in life and will become lifelong latently infected, meaning they will show no external signs of illness. However, the virus can be reactivated during times of stress, such as strenuous exercise, overexertion, long-distance transport, or at weaning.

Horses with neurological disease caused by EHV-1 infection can soon become uncoordinated and weak and have difficulty standing, urinating, and/or defecating. Often the rear limbs are more severely affected than the front. Signs of brain dysfunction may occur as well, including extreme lethargy and a coma-like state. The disease is contagious and can be spread by direct horse-to-horse contact; by contaminated hands, equipment, and/or tack; and, for a short time, through aerosol dissemination within the environment of the stall and stable.

There has been a marked increase in the number of EHV-1/EHM cases in the US in recent years. In the past 30 days, cases have been reported at large horse facilities and events in several states, including Idaho, Arizona, Nevada, and California. Owners who plan on taking their horses to such facilities and events can help prevent spread of the disease by practicing proper biosecurity measures. This includes not sharing equipment such as water/feed buckets and tack. They should also isolate their horses if they suspect them of being sick, and not allow them to leave the premise until cleared by a veterinarian.

More information on EHV can be obtained by contacting the Wyoming Livestock Board Field Office.

Nevada Department of Agriculture has received reports that 2 horses in attendance at the National Reined Cow Horse Association (NRCHA) Stallion Stakes event have tested positive for the respiratory non-neurologic form of equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1). One horse was from California, and the 2nd was from Clark County [NV] and is under quarantine order by State Veterinarian JJ Goicoechea.

Horses in attendance at the NRCHA event, which took place at the South Point Equestrian Center 30 Mar 2019 through 6 Apr 2019, may have been exposed to EHV-1 and should exercise extreme caution when traveling or competing.

"No quarantine is in place for the South Point Equestrian Center, and the facility continues to exercise extreme caution," Dr. JJ Goicoechea said. "At this time, I am recommending horse owners in Nevada do not travel or compete with their horses."

In addition, there has been one unrelated case of EHV-1 reported on an unvaccinated horse with neurologic signs in Clark County [NV].

"These 2 cases are not related and are examples of why monitoring of horses and rapid reporting of positive test results are critical to protecting Nevada's equine industry," Dr. Goicoechea said. "The facility where the EHV-1-positive horse with neurologic signs is located has also been placed under quarantine, and I am not making additional recommendations because the horse has no travel history off the property."

EHV-1 is a reportable disease, meaning when veterinarians diagnose it, they are required to notify the Nevada Department of Agriculture, per NRS 571.160. A list of reportable diseases can be found at <agri.nv.gov>.

Dr. Goicoechea continues to recommend best biosecurity practices as event season is underway, and always monitor horses for signs of disease, like fever or runny nose. Biosecurity means doing everything possible to reduce chances of an infectious disease being transferred by people, animals, equipment or vehicles. EHV-1 and other diseases can be easily transferred on boots, coats, gloves and equipment. Some basic practices include:

- Never share equipment between horses, and always wear clean clothes when going from ill horses to others.
- Always start chores at healthy horses, and end with sick or recovering (within 30 days) horses.
- Avoid common areas such as hitching rails and wash racks during an outbreak.

The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported Wed 10 Apr 2019 that 2 horses in Ontario, Canada, have tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1). "On 2 Apr 2019, the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs was notified of a confirmed case of equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM, the neurologic form of EHV-1) ... at a facility with both competition and resident horses in the Regional Municipality of York," the EDCC said. "An unvaccinated senior gelding was euthanized after developing sudden and severe neurological signs."

Subsequently, the EDCC reported, "a 2nd horse, which had been stabled at the same facility in the Municipality of York for a short period of time prior to returning to the District of Cochrane ... developed intermittent fevers and has also tested positive for EHV-1." The 2nd horse is recovering.

The veterinarian for the Municipality of York facility is advising the owner on movement restrictions and biosecurity, while the owner of the District of Cochrane facility has placed that premises under a voluntary quarantine, the EDCC said.

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM.

In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or contact with clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help prevent disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

[Although the neurological form of this disease does not have a specific vaccine, vaccinating your animal with the current vaccine can help reduce the chances of your animal acquiring this disease and/or lessen the severity of the neurological form.

Biosecurity is so critical here. In fact, overly cautious should be the mantra of all individuals near this disease. You simply cannot be too careful in trying to avoid tracking this disease around. - Mod.TG
