The Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture today reported a focus of foot & mouth
disease (FMD) in Careiro da Varzea, eastern Amazonas state, close to the
capital, Manaus. The diagnosis was made by the Ministrys animal disease
laboratory in Belem, Para state, of 4 bovines between 12 & 24 months old.
The outbreak was reported by the farm owners on 25 Aug 2004.
The ministry says the risk to the FMD-free areas of Brazil is low, since the
herd is 500km from the zone recognized internationally as FMD-free. The
World Animal Health Organization (OIE) has been informed, as well as the Pan-
American FMD Center (Panaftosa) [also in Brazil], neighboring countries and
trading partners. Specialists are taking all the necessary steps to control
the disease and eradicate the focus.

[It is to be hoped that those countries which import Brazilian beef will not
over-react this time the way they did to the previous 2004 report (see refs.
below), & ban all Brazilian beef, even that which Brazil exports from its
internationally recognized FMD-free zones.  Mod.JW]
