["An analysis of the genome sequences confirms the high genetic variability of the currently circulating viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b. In Europe, at least 14 different reassortant viruses of different subtypes were determined. Viruses of the H5N8 subtype are dominant, as is the case in Germany: 3 different H5N8 reassortants, as well as viruses of the subtypes H5N1, H5N3, H5N4, and H5N5 have been genetically characterized. These viruses also show a distinct neurotropism with partially very high viral loads in the brain."
