California health officials are confronting growing numbers of monkeypox cases, with numbers doubling in Los Angeles County over the past 2 weeks.

The state has nearly 3000 cases, and 1/3 of those are in Los Angeles County. Late last week [week of 15 Aug 2022], California Department of Public Health Director Tomas Aragon, MD, DrPH, announced the state will now formally call the disease "mpox," not "monkeypox."

Latinos are the most affected group in the state, representing 39% of reported cases, White people 38%, and Black people 12%.

Also late last week, Aragon announced more specific isolation measures for California residents with the virus. Staying home is urged for all cases and suspected cases (except to see a health provider) until lesions are fully healed for 48 hours, meaning scabs have fallen off and new skin is seen. People with the virus who live with others should isolate alone in a room in the house or apartment.

For those with lesions that can be fully covered, limited activities outside the home can be resumed when they have not had a fever or new lesions for 48 hours.

All case-patients are also encouraged to use condoms for at least 12 weeks after infection and to wear a respirator face covering until all lesions have resolved.

As of the end of last week, the United States had 14 115 monkeypox cases [now 15 430]

In other news, Seattle's King County [Washington state] has declared a public health emergency for monkeypox. The move will allow increased funding and staffing for the Department of Health.

Washington state had counted 333 monkeypox infections as of late last week, the Seattle Times reported, 275 of which were confirmed in King County, according to the state Department of Health.

[4] USA: pediatric cases

On 22 Jul 2022, 2 young children were diagnosed with monkeypox, the CDC confirmed.

Details are scant because the CDC is still investigating how the children became infected, but it is likely due to household transmission. Although both children have symptoms, they are in good health and receiving tecovirimat (TPOXX, Siga Technologies).

The cases are unrelated, according to Jennifer McQuiston, DVM, the deputy director of the CDC's Division of High Consequence and a captain in the US Public Health Service. The 1st case was reported in a California toddler, and the other is an infant who was traveling through the Washington, DC, area when the child tested positive. The 2nd child is not a US resident, the CDC said.

Several cisgender women also have been diagnosed with monkeypox, according to the CDC. The outbreak has primarily concerned men who have sex with men (MSM) until recently.

"Since the outbreak began in May [2022], most of the cases have occurred within gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men," the agency said in a statement. However, the CDC has emphasized that monkeypox can affect anyone who has close contact with people who have monkeypox, and this includes children, the agency said in a statement.

Monkeypox spreads through close skin-to-skin contact, which -- in the case of children -- could include holding, cuddling, and feeding, as well as through shared items, such as towels, bedding, cups, and utensils.

It is not unusual that other groups are starting to see cases, according to Dr McQuiston, as more people test positive because living in a household with a positive person increases the risk for exposure.

Even pets living in the household can be infected with monkeypox, according to the CDC. The agency provides advice for people with monkeypox to keep pets from becoming infected and spreading the virus to others. Avoid close contact, such as petting, cuddling, hugging, kissing, and licking. Don't let the animal sleep in your bed, and don't share food.

Both the Jynneos (smallpox and monkeypox vaccine, live, non-replicating, Bavarian Nordic A/S) vaccine and tecovirimat treatment are available for children under special expanded access protocols, the agency said.

ref: Guzzetta G, Mammone A, Ferraro F, et al. Early estimates of monkeypox incubation period, generation time, and reproduction number, Italy, May-June 2022. Emerg Infect Dis. 2022; 28(10)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We analyzed the 1st 255 PCR-confirmed cases of monkeypox [MPX] in Italy in 2022. Preliminary estimates indicate a mean incubation period of 9.1 (95% CI 6.5-10.9) days, mean generation time of 12.5 (95% CI 7.5-17.3) days, and reproduction number among men who have sex with men of 2.43 (95% CI 1.82-3.26).

Conclusions
-----------
The 1st large outbreak of MPX outside Africa is to some extent unique. The analysis of the virus genome strongly suggests that the epidemic is caused by the West African clade [clade IIb] of the MPX virus; however, with the exception of one case-patient who reported travels to West Africa, >60% of cases diagnosed in Italy were autochthonous. Retrospective investigations in Portugal and United Kingdom indicated that the 1st case-patients had symptoms in April 2022. The presence of skin lesions at the point of sexual contact is suggestive of sexual transmission.

After early reports of this multicountry outbreak, the Ministry of Health of Italy issued recommendations consisting of case notification, protective measures to reduce contacts and possible exposure for healthcare workers, tracing of close contacts with monitoring of symptom onset, and the possibility of implementing quarantine measures at the discretion of local health authorities in particular epidemiologic or environmental contexts. After the 1st 4 cases in MSM in Italy who had traveled abroad, cases were increasingly notified, mostly in the Lombardy and Lazio regions, where Milan and Rome are located; 11 of 21 regional health authorities reported cases. Almost all cases were among MSM. Travel abroad occurred in a substantial fraction of cases (38.9%) identified in Italy, and direct or sexual contact is still likely to be the main transmission mode. Whether the infection was transmitted through direct contact with skin lesions or body fluids remains undefined. The link to different geographic areas (Europe and West Africa) underlines the possibility of multiple independent introductions of the virus, suggesting widespread infection in West Africa before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Using a limited number of MPX cases, we provided estimates of the mean incubation period (≈9 days; n = 15 persons with known date of exposure and 15 persons with known travel dates in Canary Islands) and of the mean generation time (≈12 days; n = 16 infector-infectee pairs). Based on the estimated mean generation time, we found that the reproduction number for this outbreak is ≈2.4, although with a broad uncertainty (95% CI 1.82-3.26) because of the limited number of locally acquired confirmed cases. We found small variations in the estimated reproduction number (mean values ranging from 2.08 to 2.70) when considering different distributions of the generation time (mean 7.5 or 17.3 days) and when exploring alternative assumptions on the importation of cases (Appendix). Our estimates of the reproduction number refer to the community of MSM in which MPX is spreading and not to the general population. The extent to which the decrease of the reproduction number estimated after 12 Jun 2022, is a result of reduced transmission (e.g., led by increasing awareness about the risk of infection) or from the analysis of incomplete data because of diagnostic and reporting delays is unclear. However, considering that most cases seem to have been transmitted by sexual contact, the reproduction number is likely below the threshold in the general population. Besides the limited number of cases, our estimates might be biased by several factors: the assumption that case-patients returning from Canary Islands acquired the infection there, possible recall bias for the dates of exposure, and selection bias in the reconstructed infector-infectee pairs (e.g., a recent sexual partner might be more likely to be identified). Finally, the observed reproduction number might have been inflated by the potential occurrence of superspreading events.

Maintaining a high level of public attention and providing nonstigmatizing information to at-risk population groups are key to containing the spread of MPX virus, in addition to considering the seasonal intensity of aggregation events and recreational activities. Our estimates provide useful indications to assist with outbreak surveillance and containment. The distribution of the incubation period identifies the period over which symptoms should be monitored among identified contacts, and the generation time provides insight into the recommended duration of isolation for confirmed cases and the timeframe for contact tracing. The generation time is also necessary for computing the net reproduction number, which is critical to monitoring the spread of disease over time.
