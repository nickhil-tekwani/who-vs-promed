Thailand: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 2
-----------------------------------------------
As of Wed 27 Sep 2006, the Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has
confirmed the country's 25th case of human infection with the H5N1
avian influenza virus. The case, which was fatal, was the 3rd
detected this year [2006] and the 3rd fatality.
The case occurred in a 59-year-old farmer from Nong Bua Lam Phu
Province in the northeastern part of the country. He developed fever
on 14 Jul 2006, was hospitalized on 21 Jul 2006, and died on 10 Aug
2006. Possible H5N1 infection was suspected when relatives reported
the sudden death, in the days prior to symptom onset, of several
fighting cocks raised by the farmer. Local veterinary authorities
noted a number of poultry outbreaks in the area.
Repeated tests on samples taken from his upper respiratory tract were
negative by PCR for all influenza A viruses, including H5N1. He was
treated with the antiviral drug, oseltamivir. Virus was eventually
isolated from lung samples taken at autopsy.
Of the 25 cases confirmed to date in Thailand, 17 have been fatal.
Poultry outbreaks were confirmed in 2 provinces of Thailand in late
July of this year [2006] following a lull in outbreaks dating back to
9 Nov 2005.

Indonesian Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 33
-----------------------------------------------
As of Wed 27 Sep 2006, the Ministry of Health in Indonesia has
confirmed the country's 68th case of human infection with the H5N1
avian influenza virus. The patient is a 20-year-old male from
Bandung, West Java. He developed symptoms of fever and cough on 17
Sep 2006 and was hospitalized on 24 Sep 2006. He remains hospitalized.
The man's 23-year-old brother developed symptoms on 16 Sep 2006. He
died of respiratory disease on 24 Sep 2006, 2 hours after admission
to hospital. Infection with the H5N1 virus is suspected for the
23-year-old male but cannot be confirmed as no samples were collected
for testing. Both men had direct contact with dead chickens when
feeding carcasses to their dogs. Local agricultural authorities also
found evidence of H5 infection in household birds.
A 3rd sibling, a 15-year-old female, was hospitalized on 25 Sep 2006
after developing symptoms of fever and cough. Initial test results
received on 27 Sep 2006 were negative for the H5 virus subtype and
positive for the H1 subtype, indicating an infection with normal
seasonal influenza. She remains hospitalized in a stable condition.
Of the 68 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 51 have been fatal.

[This negative test result from the sister of the H5N1-positive
patient in Bandung, West Java reduces the significance of the
suspected cluster of human avian influenza cases currently under
investigation there. Only one of the 3 members of the cluster of
blood relatives has so far tested positive for H5N1 virus infection.
Consequently, evidence suggesting person-to-person transmission does
not yet exist. Further testing will be required to resolve the issue. - Mod.CP]
