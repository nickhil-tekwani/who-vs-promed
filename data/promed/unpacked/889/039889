Hundreds of tourists may have been exposed to highly infectious
measles virus infection with authorities on alert for a possible
outbreak in Airlie Beach. A foreign male tourist fell sick with the
highly-contagious disease on a 5-day holiday in the Whitsundays. He
did not contract the virus in Australia but may have spread it into
the community. The tourist is understood to have gone on a boat
cruise, swum in the public lagoon and dined at various restaurants in
the popular north Queensland tourist village.

"We're concerned about the possibility of measles virus spreading
into the local community and elsewhere in Queensland due to the large
number of travellers and visitors to the area," said Tropical
Regional Services Medical Officer Dr Steven Donohue. Measles is
extremely contagious and is spread in tiny droplets through coughing
and spluttering. The virus can survive for several hours in the
environment. Dr Donohue said symptoms usually start around 10 days
after contact with an infected person. The sick tourist was in the
Whitsundays from 30 Jan to 4 Feb 2010. "Although the patient didn't
get measles in Australia, he would have been highly infectious while
in the Airlie Beach region," Dr Donohue said.

"Now is the time for people to be aware of any signs of infection.
Anyone travelling or living in the Whitsundays who develops a fever,
cough, runny nose and eyes or a blotchy red rash in the next few
weeks should seek advice from their GP. However, it's important to
call the practice to say they could have measles and ask to be seen
away from the waiting room to avoid spreading the disease to others."

A foreign tourist with a case of measles has triggered an infectious
disease alert in the holiday playground of the Whitsundays.
Queensland Health this morning [10 Feb 2010] issued a measles
outbreak warning for the region after the man tested positive. He had
been staying at Airlie Beach between 30 Jan and 4 Feb 2010. Tropical
Regional Services Medical Officer Dr Steven Donohue said the man had
brought the illness from overseas, and authorities feared it could
easily spread. "Although the patient didn't get measles in Australia,
he would have been highly infectious while in the Airlie Beach
region," Dr Donohue said. "We're concerned about the possibility of
the measles virus spreading into the local community and elsewhere in
Queensland due to the large number of travellers and visitors to the area."

Dr Donohue said the traveller had been taken part in a range of
holiday activities around Airlie Beach, and Queensland Health
officers were now retracing his footsteps to identify anyone who may
have come into contact with him. "Queensland Health will continue to
actively investigate all cases and take steps to prevent further transmission."

Measles is spread in tiny droplets through coughing and spluttering,
and can be active for several hours in the environment, experts say.
While most people in developed countries are immunised against it as
children through the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR), babies
under 12 months of age and anyone who has not been vaccinated are at
risk of falling seriously ill. Complications from the disease can
include pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain).
"Measles can be very distressing for those affected ... (and) can be
a severe illness even in otherwise healthy adolescents and young
adults," Dr Donohue said. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, a runny
nose, moist cough, sore and red eyes, and a blotchy red rash. Dr
Donohue said symptoms usually start around 10 days after contact with
an infected person.

A measles alert has been issued after someone arrived in Darwin
infected with measles. The Northern Territory Centre for Disease
Control has issued a measles alert after confirming an infectious
person passed through Darwin last week [i.e. presumably last week of
January 2010].

The centre says the person flew to Darwin from Ho Chi Minh City in
Viet Nam on Jetstar flight JQ74 on Australia Day [26 Jan 2010].
Passengers left on the same flight bound for Sydney at 7 am.
Passengers sitting near the infected person have already been
contacted by health authorities. "However, there is still a small
risk that other passengers and visitors to the airport may have been
exposed," said the director of the Centre for Disease Control, Dr Vicki Krause.

"Measles is a very contagious viral illness that is spread between
people through coughing and sneezing," she said. "It can affect all
ages, but children under 12 months and anyone not immune are at much
greater risk. To be immune to measles, you need to have either had
measles or had 2 doses of measles vaccine." She said typical symptoms
include fever, cough, runny nose and sore eyes, followed by a red
blotchy rash appearing 3 to 4 days later.

The measles alert applies until 19 Feb 2010.

[Queensland is particularly vulnerable to introduced infections by
virtue of its role as a popular tourist destination. Measles is
highly contagious and can be spread from an infected person before
symptoms develop. The risk is highest in flights originating from or
picking up passengers in countries where measles is common and not
controlled effectively by vaccination.

In this case, the origin of the infected tourist in Queensland is not
stated. The ABC report suggests that a person on a flight from Viet
Nam may have been responsible for introducing the virus. It is
unclear if the Darwin/Sydney airplane exposure alert refers to the
same case as mentioned in the Queensland alert. Clarification of
this from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated. Measles
can be transmitted by an infected person from 4 days prior to the
onset of the rash to 4 days after the rash erupts.

The 1st sign of measles is usually a high fever, which begins about
10 to 12 days after exposure to the virus, and lasts 4 to 7 days. A
runny nose, a cough, red and watery eyes, and small white spots
inside the cheeks can develop in the initial stage. After several
days, a rash erupts, usually on the face and upper neck. Over about 3
days, the rash spreads, eventually reaching the hands and feet. The
rash lasts for 5 to 6 days and then fades. On average, the rash
occurs 14 days after exposure to the virus (within a range of 7 to 18 days).
