An outbreak of cerebro-spinal meningitis (CSM) in the Upper East Region has claimed 16 lives in two months.

Health authorities in the region are stepping up efforts to halt the spread of the disease, which has assumed an epidemic proportion. The Upper East Director of Health Service Dr. Awoonor Williams confirmed to Joy News that about 102 persons have been affected by the disease so far.

He said his outfit has received logistics from Accra to treat the disease but added more vaccines would be needed to adequately cover all the endemic areas. Dr Williams said the outbreak is being managed well in the region and assured residents “there is no cause for alarm; we are on top of the issue here”.

Although enough measures have been put in place to stop the perennial recurrence of the disease, the Director of Health Service conceded they have not been successful. He was however delighted that their strong surveillance system is able to identify the CSM. He said a team of personnel is on the ground educating residents about the disease.

[Although the above news release does not specify the microbial cause of the meningitis outbreak in Ghana, the sub-Saharan region of Africa is plagued yearly by large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis. This region, known as the "Meningitis Belt," stretches from the east to the west coast of Africa, and includes Ghana, as well as Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Benin, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo,Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Sudan, Togo, and Uganda (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no10/03-0170.htm). The meningitis outbreaks occur in the dry season (December to June), and every 8-12 years large outbreaks occur (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx). Attack rates during these cyclic epidemics of meningitis range from 100 to 800 per 100 000 population, but individual communities have reported rates as high as 1000 per 100 000 (World Health Organization: Meningococcal meningitis fact sheet: http://www.emro.who.int/sudan/pdf/FactSheet-Meningitis.pdf).

The following is extracted from the moderator’s comments in ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Nigeria: (YO), susp. 20110524.1581:

“Epidemic thresholds are used to confirm the emergence of an epidemic in order to step up control measures, that is, mass vaccination and appropriate case management. For definitions of epidemic thresholds, see http://www.who.int/disasters/repo/6618.doc.

“To control an outbreak, WHO recommends mass vaccination with the appropriate meningococcal vaccine in every involved district in an attempt to induce herd immunity, whereby transmission is blocked when a critical percentage of the population has been vaccinated (see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). In 2009, meningococcal serogroups A and W135 were involved in outbreaks in Nigeria (see ProMED mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Nigeria (03) 20090509.1731). These serogroups cause meningitis that is potentially vaccine-preventable. However, in 2010, a new strain (serogroup X) of meningococcal meningitis emerged in Burkina Faso that led to huge outbreaks in that country, with 46 percent (6/13) of the regions in the country being at epidemic level. Serogroup X is one of those for which no vaccine exists. Niger, which borders the Yobe State of Nigeria, also experienced cases due to serogroup X in 2010 and experienced an epidemic of meningitis due to this strain in 2006 (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Africa (02): WHO meningitis region. 20100426.1343).”

The Upper East Region of Ghana is primarily rural and is the smallest of 10 administrative regions in Ghana, with only 2.7 per cent of the total land area of Ghana and with a population in 2000 of 920,089, which accounts for 4.9 per cent of Ghana’s total population (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_East_Region). It is bordered by Burkina Faso to the north and Togo to the east.
