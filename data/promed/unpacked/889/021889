DRC: Sleeping Sickness Outbreak Reported in Katende, Kasai Occidental
---------------------------------------
An outbreak of sleeping sickness has been reported in Katende health
zone, 90 km northeast of Kananga, capital of Kasai Occidental
Province in south-central Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),
according to Dr Victor Kande Betukumesu, director of the Congo's
national programme to fight the disease.
"Our representatives on the ground have recorded more than a dozen
cases of the illness," he told IRIN on Monday. He added that the
disease had already caused a number of deaths that had not been
registered owing to a lack of infrastructure, public understanding of
the illness, and health personnel in the region. "Because of a lack
of infrastructure, numerous people suffering from the disease must
travel sometimes great distances to Kananga or Mbuji-Mayi [capital of
neighbouring Kasai Oriental Province], while the majority of the ill
are not identified because they remain in their villages outside the
Katende health zone," he added.
"The majority of people suffering from trypanosomiasis [sleeping
sickness] believe they are suffering from malaria, because the 2
illnesses present the same symptoms," he said.
According to Kande, the resurgence of sleeping sickness is due
largely to the destruction of infrastructure during recent years of
war in the DRC. "There are hardly any medical personnel in this area
anymore, and motor vehicles -- as well as just about every other
piece of essential equipment -- were pillaged during the 2 successive
wars in the DRC," Kande said.
The national programme for the fight against trypanosomiasis
(Programme national de lutte contre la trypanosomiase) suspended its
activities in 1993. It is trying to resume its efforts, pending
support from national and international partners.
Sleeping sickness is transmitted via the bite of bloodsucking male
and female tsetse flies that transfer the parasites from human to
human. Cattle and other wild mammals act as reservoir hosts of the
parasites. Tsetse flies can acquire parasites by feeding on these
animals, or on an infected person. Prevention and control of sleeping
sickness relies mainly on systematic surveillance of at-risk
populations, coupled with treatment of infected people.
In addition, reduction in numbers of tsetse flies plays a significant
role. In the past, this has involved extensive clearance of bush to
destroy tsetse fly breeding and resting sites, and widespread
application of insecticides. More recently, efficient traps and
screens have been developed that, usually with community
participation, can keep tsetse populations at low levels in a
cost-effective manner.
Other than Katende, sleeping sickness has been reported in other
regions of Kasai Occidental. According to the World Health
Organization, although sleeping sickness claims comparatively few
lives annually, the risk of major epidemics means that surveillance
and ongoing control measures must be maintained.

[The WHO estimates that 300 000 to 500 000 people may have
trypanosomiasis in Africa after the disease was nearly eradicated in
the early 1960s. ProMED has reported extensively on the emerging
epidemic of trypanosomiasis in central Africa. Our posting from 16
Feb 2000 shows the increase in cases over the past 80 years and the
dramatic increase in the last decade due to internal wars in the
Congo. For more on trypanosomiasis, go to:
