Updates on undiagnosed illness in Ukrainian orphanage
-----------------------------------------------------
It seems that after three weeks, the Ukrainian Ministry of Health has
determined that the cause of this outbreak was an undetermined acute
respiratory infection, and that all the remaining children have
recovered and been discharged. The only specific respiratory virus
they seem to have excluded is influenza virus.

Oddly, they seem to have tested for an excluded a bunch of [unlikely]
agents, including norovirus, poliovirus , smallpox virus, and
rotovirus, but no other respiratory agents, and no bacteria
whatsoever despite the apparent response to treatment.

[Fortunately this outbreak appears to have been contained. On the
basis of the clinical evidence released so far it would be
unrealistic to suggest a specific etiology. Further information is
awaited. If a respiratory infection is indeed the cause of the
outbreak, an agent such as respiratory syncytial virus, causing a
normally benign infection, can be lethal in an institutionalized setting.
