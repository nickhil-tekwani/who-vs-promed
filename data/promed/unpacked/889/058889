Oysters from South Africa have been linked to cases of foodborne illness in Hong Kong. The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) in Hong Kong ordered the suspension of imports of raw oysters produced by Zwembesi Farm Limited in South Africa this past week. Six food poisoning clusters have been identified after consumption of raw oysters at one restaurant in Mong Kok and another in Tsim Sha Tsui. It is not clear what the infectious agent is or how many people are sick. The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) previously reported it was investigating 2 clusters involving 11 illnesses in people that had dinner at a restaurant in Mong Kok.

Six males and 2 females, aged 24-31, developed abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting about 35 hours after the meal on 17 Sep [2021]. The other cluster involved 3 women aged 23, who had similar symptoms about 30 hours after having dinner at the same restaurant on 18 Sep [2021]. Six people sought medical care, but none required hospitalization.

A CFS spokesman said: "The CFS conducted investigations at the restaurants concerned and found that both restaurants had sold raw oysters that were harvested from Zwembesi Farm in South Africa. For the sake of prudence, the CFS has immediately instructed the trade to suspend the import into and sale within Hong Kong of all raw oysters produced by Zwembesi Farm in South Africa."

Zwembesi Farms, part of the Knysna Oyster Company, told Business Insider South Africa that test results were clear for oysters.

Oysters feed by filtering a large volume of seawater, so pathogens can accumulate in them if they are grown in or harvested from contaminated water. Raw or partially cooked oysters are high-risk foods, so susceptible groups, such as pregnant women, young children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems or liver diseases, should avoid eating them. Also, they can make otherwise healthy people sick.

CFS has also told all importers and the restaurants concerned to stop supplying and selling the affected raw oysters and is tracing distribution of the implicated product. The agency said it will inform the South African authorities and notify local trading partners. It will continue to investigate the incident and act to safeguard food safety and public health.

In August 2017, import of raw oysters harvested by Zwembesi Farms was suspended after a link to food poisoning cases. That ban was lifted in January 2018.

[Norovirus illness could be considered here as well as bacterial infections due to _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ and other vibrioses.

Diarrheal shellfish poisoning (DSP) is noteworthy and not often discussed but is less of a possibility because of the short incubation period of the illness as apparently compared to here. DSP "is a gastrointestinal illness caused by the consumption of shellfish contaminated with algal toxins produced by marine dinoflagellates belonging to the genera _Dinophysis_ spp. (_D. fortii_, _D. mitra_, _D. rotundata_, _D. tripos_, _D. acuta_, _D. norvegica_, and _D. acuminata_) and _Prorocentrum_ spp. (_P. lima_, _P. maculosum_, _P. concavum_, and _P. hoffmannianum_). The DSP toxins, including okadaic acid (OA) and its analogues dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1), dinophysistoxin-2 (DTX-2), and dinophysistoxin-3 (DTX-3), belong to the larger group of lipophilic toxins that also includes the azaspiracid, yessotoxin, and pectenotoxin group toxins."

The term "diarrhetic shellfish poisoning" is often used for the illness, but this moderator prefers to use "diarrheal shellfish poisoning" to avoid any confusion between the almost homophones "diarrhetic" and "diuretic."

DSP is often mistaken for norovirus-like disease. It is treated with rehydration, and affected individuals usually recover in 1-2 days. DSP diarrhea is the most commonly reported symptom (92%), closely followed by nausea (80%) and vomiting (79%), with onset 30 minutes to 12 hours from ingestion. Cooking or freezing does not destroy the toxin. DSP is most commonly found in shellfish in Europe and Japan but can appear anywhere and bears consideration with the appropriate epidemiology. - Mod.LL
