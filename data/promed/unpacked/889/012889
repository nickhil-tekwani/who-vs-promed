The Brazilian Federal Police said yesterday [28 Apr 2003] that they
are 90 percent certain that an Egyptian sailor who died in Brazil on
11 Apr 2003 had anthrax. The first mate died in Porto Trombetas,
Oriximina, in western Para state. According to the autopsy report
from the Medico-Legal Institute of Belem [capital of Para], he died
after vomiting, suffering internal hemorrhages & multiple organ
failure.
The victim flew from Cairo, Egypt, to Sao Paulo, Brazil, then by air
to Macapa, Amapa state, where he boarded a cargo ship for Porto
Trombetas to load bauxite [aluminum ore] for transport to Canada.
The police said he carried a suitcase addressed to Canada, from which
he could have been infected. The police alerted Canadian authorities
[after the
boat had left Brazilian waters. - Mod.JW]
The mining company said the vessel had been inspected by Anvisa [the
Brazilian ports & airports health authority] on first arrival in
Brazil at Fundeadouro de Fazendinha, AmapÂ· state. The sailor joined
the ship during the actual inspection process. The ship arrived in
Porto Trombetas, Para state, on 10 Apr 2003, & was visited by tax &
shipping officials on 11 Apr 2003, at which time the victim was found
dead in his cabin. The body was sent to Belem [the state capital].
Preliminary findings, released on 16 Apr 2003, were that the victim died of
hemorrhage followed by fainting & death by asphyxiation, suggestive of
infection by _Bacillus anthracis_.
A team from Anvisa has been in Porto Trombetas since 25 Apr 2003, at
the request of the Federal Police, consulting with local port &
shipping authorities and the mining company new routines for
inspecting foreign vessels.

[It should be noted that other reports say, on the one hand, that some of
the people who had contact with the body became ill but have recovered --
supporting an infectious cause -- & on the other that US authorities are
discounting this as a death related to drug smuggling. - Mod.JW]

Brazil police study 'anthrax' death
Police in Brazil say they are investigating whether a crew member from an
Egyptian merchant ship who died in a hotel room in the port of Trombetas was
killed by anthrax. Police spokesman Fernando Sergio Castro said the man,
Ibrahim Saved Soliman Ibrahim, had died after opening a suitcase he was
carrying which police suspect contained the substance. Ibrahim died on 11
April and the next day his ship set sail from Trombetas bound for Canada.
Mr Castro said police were 90% sure that Ibrahim was the victim of anthrax,
and that a second test confirming their suspicions should be ready on
Tuesday. Ibrahim had flown to Brazil from Cairo to join the Wadi al
Arab after it had loaded up its cargo of bauxite in the Amazon. While
in Cairo he was given the suitcase by an unidentified person who, it
is believed, asked him to deliver it to someone when he arrived in
Canada. Mr Castro said police do not think that Ibrahim knew what the
suitcase contained, otherwise he would not have opened it. "He opened
it because he was curious," Mr Castro said.
An autopsy showed the Egyptian died after suffering vomiting,
internal bleeding and multiple organ failure, although further tests
are being carried out.
Several health workers became ill after finding Ibrahim's body and
were taken to hospital, but are now said to be out of danger. Four
other crew members who accompanied Ibrahim on the flight from Cairo
were placed under medical supervision, but the suspect bag remained
on board the ship.
The ship, the Wadi Al Arab, which was bound for Canada carrying a cargo of
bauxite, has been quarantined off the Atlantic port of Halifax since last
Thursday.
The Canadian authorities say they are waiting to hear the results of
Brazil's tests, but that there is no risk to the public. The Canadian
authorities were notified by Interpol of the possibility of anthrax
contamination and moved to intercept the ship, placing it under
quarantine offshore. "We believe that all the government officials
and agencies that are involved are dealing with the issue
appropriately. There need not be fear," said Canada's Solicitor
General Wayne Easter.
Neder Duarte, a federal police official in Belem - the regional capital in
northern Brazil where Ibrahim's body and belongings were transferred - said
police were trying to establish who gave Ibrahim the bag and where it
was being taken. "One can associate this with an act of
international terrorism, but up to now there is nothing concrete," he
said.

Anthrax ship sparks rumours of mysterious 'secret suitcase'
MONTREAL - RCMP investigators say there's no evidence to back up news
reports about a suitcase containing anthrax on the Egyptian ship anchored
near Halifax. "This is still a story, and we have absolutely no reason to
think that there's any, any truth to it," said RCMP spokesperson Dan Tanner.
According to the Reuters news agency, the crew member who died was carrying
a suitcase to be delivered to someone in Canada. Brazilian police say they
suspect there's anthrax in the case. The crew member died of symptoms
consistent with exposure to anthrax.
The suitcase is reportedly sealed and still in Brazil.
The ship was on its way from Brazil to the Alcan smelter in Quebec with a
load of bauxite. It was diverted to Nova Scotia and has been quarantined off
the coast of Halifax since Friday. Infectious disease experts said they
found no obvious sign of anthrax aboard the vessel during their search on
the weekend. Health Canada expects the test results Thursday.

Brazilian police curious about mystery bag
An Egyptian sailor who died in Brazil of a suspected case of anthrax aboard
a merchant ship now quarantined outside Halifax Harbour was carrying a bag
to a friend in Canada, say Brazilian police. They alerted Interpol about the
potentially contaminated package Ibrahim Sayed Soliman Ibrahim was carrying
on the Wadi Alarab, said Neder Duarte, federal police chief of the city of
Belem in Brazil's northern state of Para. "Maybe he had opened the luggage
and then had problems with anthrax," Duarte told The Daily News yesterday.
Brazilian police are investigating the case to determine if Ibrahim was
somehow involved with bioterrorism, Duarte said. "We cannot affirm really
that link of terrorism," he said. "But we have to investigate that
possibility."
Brazilian police don't know who Ibrahim was supposed to deliver the package
to, or where it was going in Canada, Duarte said. "The bag didn't come out
from the the ship, just the corpse came out from the ship," he said. "The
bag is in Canada because the bag went with the ship."
Health Canada experts visited the Wadi Alarab on Saturday to take samples
from the quarantined ship. They expect results from those tests by Thursday
morning, said department spokeswoman Tracy Taweel.
Mounties, however, say they are not probing the case. "We have not been
asked to conduct any sort of criminal investigation or terrorist
investigation at all," said RCMP Sgt. Wayne Noonan. "We are still saying
that Health Canada (is) our lead agency." Mounties have not found the bag
Brazilian police indicated Ibrahim was carrying before he died. "We have no
information about any suitcase containing any foreign or biological
material," Noonan said. "And we haven't been asked to do any investigation
by Interpol or by the Brazilian authorities."
Ibrahim - who was second-in-command on the Wadi Alarab - died about 11 days
ago of septicimia, which occurs when toxins from the bacteria enter the
blood stream and do damage to the organs. There was strong hemorrhaging of
the lungs, pancreas and brain, a symptom consistent with anthrax poisoning.
He had travelled recently to Brazil from Cairo to join his ship, which
loaded bauxite in the Amazon to take to an Alcan aluminum plant in Quebec.
Police didn't discover he may have died from anthrax until the
225-metre-long ship had left Brazilian waters, Duarte said. Brazilian
authorities are almost certain anthrax killed Ibrahim. But Duarte said final
test results in his country should also be available later this week "It's a
case of public health, so we have to know the real situation," Francisco
Adriano, another federal police agent, said in a telephone interview from
Brasilia, the capital of the South American country.

Reports of suitcase holding anthrax unfounded: police
BRASILIA, Brazil - A Brazilian police officer says there is no substance to
reports that an Eygptian sailor believed killed by anthrax was in possession
of a suitcase filled with the deady bacteria. Federal Police Agent
Francisco Adriano says they haven't found anything alarming during
the course of their investigation.
Media reports Monday suggested Ibrahim Saved Soliman Ibrahim was handed a
suitcase when he left Cairo. Ibrahim was to join the freighter Wadi Al Arab
which was getting ready to head to Canada.
It is currently anchored off Halifax, under quarantine.
RCMP spokesman Wayne Noonan say they have no evidence or information
to suggest any criminal activity. Noonan says in light of the
reports they are working through Interpol to sort out fact from
fiction.
[We have included news reports from Brazil, BBC, and Canada, including
Halifax. This reveals a confusion on where the suitcase is, whether on the
ship or in Brazil, and even the nature of its contents. Time will tell in
this Eric Ambler script. There is an intelligence rule that the first
reports are always inaccurate and reality only begins to emerge by
the third. That the initial diagnosis was only 90% realiable suggests
that the Brazilian attempts at culturing any pathogens were not
successful and that further tests, ?PCR, are awaited. If it turns out
to be anthrax the origin will be of interest as Egypt has claimed to
be free of that disease for many years. - Mod.MHJ]
