Salmonella outbreak linked to poultry
-------------------------------------
9 people from New Mexico and 4 other states have been reported with
salmonella infections in the past 2 months, and 6 of those cases are
linked to young poultry from a New Mexico hatchery. The state Health
Department is not identifying the hatchery pending the completion of
the investigation.
The department is collaborating with the Colorado Health and
Environment Departments to investigate salmonella cases that have
been reported in New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.
7 of the 9 cases in Mar and Apr 2005 were in children age 1 year or
younger, the New Mexico agency said. 3 of those with infections live
in Taos, Roosevelt, and Curry counties. Symptoms of salmonella, which
begin 12 to 72 hours after exposure, include diarrhea, fever, and
abdominal cramps that usually last 4 days to a week. The Health
Department said most people recover without medication or treatment,
but that young children can suffer from more severe symptoms.
Human salmonella infections occur when contaminated food, hands, or
other objects are placed in the mouth. Health officials recommend
that young children avoid contact with poultry and that people who
handle baby chicks, ducks, or other poultry thoroughly wash their
hands with soap and water afterward. Poultry also should be kept
outdoors in an area separate from young children or sources of food.

5 in Oregon stricken with Salmonella from Easter chicks
---------------------------------------------------
5 Oregon cases of Salmonella have been identified by public health
officials, with the source of the outbreak being traced to baby
chicks from a Washington hatchery. Residents in the states of
Washington and Idaho have also been affected. Some people who were
infected reported that they did not handle chicks directly, but had
worked or passed through rooms where chicks were kept. Environments
can be easily contaminated from bacteria in animal wastes, according
to Emilio DeBess, a public health veterinarian for the state of
Oregon.
The 1st cases of Salmonella Ohio, a rare serotype, [_S. enterica_
serotype Ohio - Mod.LL] were identified on 11 Apr 2005, with the most
recent cases reported on 26 Apr 2005, DeBess said. Public health
officials warn that more cases could surface.
Baby chicks, usually sold by mail order or in feed stores, have been
repeatedly identified as the source of salmonellosis outbreaks.
Thorough hand washing with soap and warm water is the most important
way to prevent [the transmission of] Salmonella or other infections,
DeBess said. He also recommends that children be supervised so they
do not nuzzle or kiss chicks or other fowl.
Salmonella or by contact with infected people or animals. Animals
often infected with Salmonella include turtles, iguanas, other
reptiles, cattle, chicks, ducklings and other birds.
Oregon, Washington, and Idaho public health officials have worked
collaboratively to share information on this outbreak.

[These appear to be 2 separate outbreaks of salmonellosis related to
Easter chicks. Adequate hand washing is always needed after exposure
to live animals, such as chicks and ducklings, that may carry the
salmonella bacterium. The exposure certainly doesn't need to be
related to uncooked meat. - Mod.LL]
