Natural Occurrence of Groundnut ringspot virus on Soybean in South Africa.
G. Pietersen, ARC-Plant Protection Research Institute, Private Bag
X134, Pretoria, South Africa; and J. Morris, Central Science
Laboratory, Sand Hutton, York, Y041 1IZ, U.K. Plant Dis. 86:1271,
2002; published on-line as D-2002-0905-03N, 2002. Accepted for
publication 25 Aug 2002.
Mechanically transmissible viruses were isolated from 2 soybean
(_Glycine max_ Merr.) plants from Rustenburg, Northwest Province and
Greytown, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, respectively (2). Viruses were
isolated by 2 serial local-lesion transmissions on _Chenopodium
quinoa_. Ringspot symptoms on _Nicotiana benthamiana_ and presence of
typical tospovirus-like particles in ultrathin sections of infected
plants suggested the presence of tospoviruses.
Serological analysis of samples using various tospovirus antisera in
several ELISA formats suggested the 2 isolates had epitopes in common
with Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), Groundnut ringspot virus
(GRSV), and Tomato chlorotic spot virus (TCSV).
Nucleotide sequences, determined using RT-PCR for 857 bp of the
nucleoprotein gene of the 2 isolates (GenBank Accession Nos. AF487516
and AF 487517), revealed a 99 percent nucleotide identity with each
other.
Sequence comparison with cognate regions of TSWV (GenBank Accession
No. D00645), GRSV-SA-05 (GenBank Accession No. S54327), and TCSV
(GenBank Accession No. S54325) showed that both isolates share 97
percent nucleotide sequence identity with GRSV (SA-05) from peanut
also originally from South Africa (1).
Both isolates are therefore considered GRSV. To our knowledge, this
is the first report of the natural occurrence of GRSV on soybean
worldwide.

[Groundnut (a.k.a. peanut) is an important crop in South Africa. GRSV
is one of several viruses known to be present in the country. The
fact that GRSV has been reported in soybean is of considerable
interest and perhaps not unexpected. It is transmitted primarily by
_Frankliniella schultzei_ and _F. occidentalis_. It is not
transmitted by pollen, seed, or by physical contact with other
plants. Natural reservoir hosts are infected peanut and _Physalis
floridana _.
Missing from this report are data on the effect of GRSV infection on
soybean yield. Pietersen indicated in correspondence that the 2
isolates identified were the only sources of the disease noticed
within the 2 soybean fields (albeit that they were found at 2
geographically distant sites). Symptoms were not very severe. He
suggested that the finding represents a relatively rare occurrence,
possibly because of vector preferences, but he has no supporting
evidence for this. TSWV has been reported on soybean (Golnaraghi,
2001: Plant Disease 85(12):1290), but in that article it is also
difficult to assess the importance of the virus on the crop. - Mod.DH]
