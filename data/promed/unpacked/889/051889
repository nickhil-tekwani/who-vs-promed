[3] Europe: Nursing home deaths
Date: Fri 22 May 2020

European countries are gradually releasing lockdown. Among them, there are places where the tension does not relax, including nursing homes. Infection spreads in these facilities, causing the most damage. Many residents are still infected, others died due to COVID-19, and it is not possible for relatives to visit. Therefore, this publication has compiled data on the number of deaths at nursing homes in European countries.

Britain has the most deaths from the new coronavirus in Europe. According to data from England and Scotland, 11 877 people have died due to COVID-19 at a nursing home in Britain as of [10 May 2020]. This accounts for 37% of the total deaths in the UK, but it is estimated that more people died of infection in nursing homes, including the elderly who moved from nursing homes to hospitals. In the 8 weeks since mid-March [2020], more than 22 000 residents have died in nursing homes in the UK, compared with the average annually.

In the UK, the number of deaths due to the new coronavirus in hospitals has been declining since mid-April [2020], but the decline in new coronavirus deaths was small until early May. That is because the number of deaths at nursing homes did not decrease significantly. Caregivers continue to shout for emergency help, but the government is slow to respond.

The problem is not just in the UK. Damage to nursing homes is particularly serious in Europe. Please see the table below. In France, the Department of Public Health publishes the total number of deaths in hospitals and nursing homes daily, and as of [18 May 2020], the number of deaths in nursing homes reached 14 363, accounting for 51% of the total.

New coronavirus-related deaths at nursing homes in European countries
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The counting method varies by country, but on average, about half of all deaths due to the new coronavirus are nursing home residents.

Country: Total deaths due to COVID-19 / No. COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes / % of country deaths in nursing homes / Date of most recent data / Source
France: 28 239 / 14 363 (3713 died in hospital) / 50.9% / 18 May 2020 / Public Health Bureau
Spain: 27 709 / 18 413 / 66.45% / 18 May 2020 / Spanish Broadcasting Corporation
UK: 31 855 / 11 687 / 36.70% / 10 May 2020 / National Bureaus of Statistics, etc.
Germany: 7935 / 2980 / 37.56% / 18 May 2020 / Robert Koch Institute
Sweden: 2075 / 948 / 45.60% / 28 Apr 2020 / Health and Welfare Agency
Italy: N/A / 2724 / N/A / 14 Apr 2020 / National Institutes of Health

In Germany, the Robert Koch Institute collects information, and as of the [18 May 2020], the number of deaths in welfare facilities including nursing homes and facilities for the disabled was 2980, accounting for 38% of the total. In Spain, according to a report by the Spanish Broadcasting Corporation, the number of deaths in nursing homes reached 18 413, or 66% of the total. Italy has few statistics available, but it is reported that many deaths occurred in nursing homes.

Side-by-side comparisons are difficult because each has different preconditions and data collection methods, but caregivers account for nearly half of all deaths from COVID-19 in several European countries.

[The media have been filled with articles on individual nursing home outbreaks/clusters in Europe and in the USA. The above article puts statistics to the order of magnitude of the problem, recognizing these are percent of deaths reported by the country, and not percent of deaths among nursing home populations. It is sobering, as this reflects the introduction of the virus into the high at-risk population based on age and pre-existing comorbidities. - Mod.MPP]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 22 May 2020.

Highlights
----------
- WHO and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) joined forces to improve health services for refugees, displaced and stateless people. WHO and UNHCR signed a new agreement to strengthen and advance public health services for the millions of displaced people around the world. A key aim this year [2020] will be to support ongoing efforts to protect some 70 million displaced people due to COVID-19 (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/21-05-2020-who-and-unhcr-join-forces-to-improve-health-services-for-refugees-displaced-and-stateless-people).

- WHO has supported the Smithsonian Science Education Center and InterAcademy Partnership to launch a new COVID-19 rapid-response guide (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/21-05-2020-smithsonian-science-education-center-with-support-of-the-world-health-organization-launches-new-covid-19-guide-for-youth) for young people aged 8-17 years, titled "COVID19! How can I protect myself and others?" (https://ssec.si.edu/covid-19). The guide, which is based on the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, aims to help young people understand the science and social science of COVID-19, as well as help them take action to keep themselves, their families and communities safe.

- WHO has launched a new search feature (https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/who-launches-new-search-feature-for-questions-on-covid-19) for questions on COVID-19. WHO's COVID-19 webpage (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) now features an enhanced natural language processing search bar, which understands questions posed in everyday language and more accurately delivers answers to those queries.

- WHO and partners have produced guidance on laboratory biosafety related to the testing of clinical specimens (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/laboratory-biosafety-guidance-related-to-coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)) and guidance on the repatriation of COVID-19 human remains by air (https://www.iata.org/contentassets/8aa8928c553042bf99a5014d8ac25c8f/guidance-document-transport-of-covid-19-human-remains.pdf), both of which are explored in today's "Subject in Focus" below.

Subject in Focus: Interdisciplinary and interagency collaboration for the transportation of clinical samples and human remains
-------------------------
It is important that the transportation of dangerous goods, in particular infectious substances, is conducted safely and in compliance with regulations. To encourage this, WHO has been in close collaboration with UN specialised agencies such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and other agencies in official relations with WHO under the Framework of Engagement with non-State actors, including the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

Such collaboration has been indispensable from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure and timely shipment of clinical samples. Both ICAO and IATA not only agreed to WHO's classification of COVID-19 clinical samples and cultures, but also ensured the compliance of IATA member air operators. WHO has also published guidance on laboratory biosafety related to the testing of clinical specimens of patients that meet the case definition of COVID-19 (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/laboratory-biosafety-guidance-related-to-coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)).

Building on these partnerships with ICAO and IATA, a collaborative document providing guidance on the repatriation of COVID-19 human remains by air (https://www.iata.org/contentassets/8aa8928c553042bf99a5014d8ac25c8f/guidance-document-transport-of-covid-19-human-remains.pdf) has also been issued (see also https://www.icao.int/Security/COVID-19/EBandSL/eb027e.pdf). This was prepared in collaboration with the US CDC, a WHO Collaborating Centre for Biosafety and Biosecurity, to which WHO provided technical expertise in relevant subject matters, including biological safety, points-of-entry, risk assessment, and infection prevention and control.

Repatriation in this context is defined as the transportation of human remains of COVID-19-infected cases from one country to another for burial purposes, at the request of the next-of-kin. The process is complex and requires careful arrangements and proper coordination. At present there is no universally applicable standard or treaty, but the Strasbourg Agreement on the Transfer of Corpses of the Council of Europe, which was agreed by some 20 states, provides a good reference point.

Key issues that need to be considered when managing COVID-19-related repatriation of human remains include:
- Specific guidance on PPE for mortuary workers, religious leaders or others who may have direct contact with the deceased;
- Respecting the dignity of the dead and their families according to cultural and religious traditions;
- Encouraging practices that balance the rights of the family with funerary practices and risks of exposure to infection on a case-by-case basis; and
- Various and sometimes competing regulations and requirements of countries of origin, transit and destination as well as aircraft operators.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 61 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the South-East Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 49 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 54 264 new cases (54.1% of the global newly reported cases), and 2956 deaths (66.0%) for this 24-hour period. Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 43.0% were reported by the USA, 36.8% by Brazil, Peru 8.4%, and Mexico 4.1%. The Americas region is maintaining its status as having the highest cumulative case count of the 6 WHO regions, with the European region as the 2nd-highest region.

The European region reported 19 634 new cases (19.6% of the global newly reported cases) and 1044 deaths (23.3%). Russia reported 45.3% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by the UK 13.3%, Turkey 4.9%, Belarus 4.7%, Italy 3.3%, and Sweden 3.3%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 13 209 new cases (13.2% of the global newly reported cases) and 180 deaths (4.0%). Pakistan reported 19.7% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Saudi Arabia 19.2%, Iran 18.1%, Qatar 11.8%, Kuwait 7.9%, the United Arab Emirates 6.8%, and Egypt 5.9%.

The African region reported 3405 new cases (3.4% of the global newly reported cases) and 71 deaths (1.6%). South Africa reported 33.3% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Cameroon at 16.3%, Nigeria 10.0%, Algeria 5.5%, Ghana 5.1%, and Guinea 4.1%.

The Western Pacific region reported 838 new cases (0.84% of the global newly reported cases) and 24 deaths (0.54%). Singapore reported 53.5% of the newly reported cases, followed by the Philippines 25.4%, Japan 10.6%, and Malaysia 6.0%.

The South East Asia region reported 8934 new cases (8.9% of the global newly reported cases) and 207 deaths (4.6%). India reported 68.1% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh 19.8%, and Indonesia 10.9%. These 3 countries make up 98.9% of all reported cases in the region. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 62.3% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia 34.2%, and Nepal 1.5%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 22 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas is increasing, as is South-East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkins' CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Johns Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
