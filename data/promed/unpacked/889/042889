Translation of information received on 8 Feb 2005 from Dr Arnaldo
Cabello Navarro, Deputy Director General of Animal Health, Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Madrid:
Spain reported that 328 258 head of cattle (bov) were vaccinated in
Andalusia for bluetongue control purposes. In fact, after
verification, it appears that the animals involved in the vaccination
scheme were sheep (ovi).

[This error was identified and corrected quickly, providing a good
example of how global surveillance systems should work. The
development of heuristic and self-correcting disease monitoring
systems should emphasize appropriate input from as many users as
possible. Cast a wide net and have many eyes looking for mistakes,
and the surveillance system will be stronger. Quick correction of
errors and responsiveness such as shown in this case are the keys to
reliability and credibility in any electronically based surveillance
system. See the comment of Mod.AS referenced below. - Mod.PC]
