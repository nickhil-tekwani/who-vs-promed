An Australian mosquito species has newly established a local population in
New Zealand.
_Aedes camptorhynchus_, a known vector of Ross River virus (and a possible
vector of both Barmah Forest and Murray Valley encephalitis viruses) has
been identified breeding in the Napier District on the eastern coast of the
North Island. The discovery followed complaints to local authorities about
aggressive mosquitoes and has been confirmed by three entomologists.
The current population is thought to be limited to a small area north of
Napier City, but recent rain has increased the potential for further
spread. It has been decided to survey the area in an attempt to define the
extent of the population, monitor the presence of adults and larvae at
sentinel sites, treat the known breeding habitat with larvicides, and set
up a national advisory group on emerging communicable diseases.

Eradicating the exotic mosquito found in Napier would be a simple job
costing about NZ$25,000, according to pest control experts, but officials
are refusing to do it till a "risk assessment strategy" is completed.
The Health Ministry refused yesterday to discuss the options for getting
rid of the mosquito capable of spreading Ross River virus. That sort of
information would form part of the strategy that was expected to be
completed by the middle of next week, it said. But pest control experts
said eradication could be done at minimal cost using an insecticide,
synthetic pyrethrum.
The cost of the insecticide and spreading is estimated to be less than
NZ$500 a hectare. Pest experts said they could cover the 50-hectare
(123-acre) site near Napier's Ahuriri Estuary, where the mosquitoes have
become established, for about NZ$25,000.
Ministry spokeswoman Rebecca Wilson said the decision to eradicate the
mosquito was "not merely a cost issue".
"The Ministry of Health along with MAF (the Agriculture and Forestry
Ministry) and the Department of Conservation need to consider any
environmental and/or any animal health impacts, as well as whether the
mosquitoes pose a serious risk to the community. Other impacts such as
tourism also need to be considered."
Forest and Bird Protection Society conservation director Kevin Smith said
he could not understand why so much time was being wasted on a risk
assessment strategy.
"We know what the risk is. The mosquito is here. What I want to see is not
a risk assessment strategy -- it's an eradication plan and implementation."
Labour environment spokeswoman Dianne Yates also called for a quicker
response.
She said it was not good enough that such pests were entering New Zealand
despite the Government's claims to the most stringent border controls in
the world.

[It is not realistic to expect to be able to control very small flying
insects at border posts. On the other hand, the longer they wait to spray,
the further will they spread & the more it will cost in the end - Mod.JW]
