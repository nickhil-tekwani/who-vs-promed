The Tennessee state veterinarian is urging horse owners to take precautions after West Nile Virus (WNV) and equine infectious anemia (EIA) have been sickened 3 horses in 3 counties.

A horse in Bedford County has tested positive for EIA.

There is no treatment or vaccine for EIA. The Tennessee Department of Agriculture states once a horse is infected with EIA, it must be permanently quarantined or euthanized.

State Veterinarian Dr. Charles Hatcher says the risk of biting insects that transmit the diseases carries "well into the fall," not just the summer months.

Hatcher advises to avoid co-mingling your horses with unfamiliar horses, sharing surgical equipment, managing manure and disposal, eliminating standing water sources, and applying insect repellants.

["Under natural conditions, the most important mode of transmission of equine infectious anemia (EIA) is by the transfer of virus-infected blood by blood-feeding insects between horses in close proximity. Virus is found free in the plasma or cell associated, principally in monocytes and macrophages of infected animals. Although infection is considered primarily blood borne, all tissues and body fluids are potentially infectious, especially during episodes of clinical disease when viral burdens are high. Transmission of EIA by biting flies is purely mechanical; the virus does not replicate in the vector. The chance of transmission of EIA is directly proportional to the volume of blood retained on the mouthparts of the insect after feeding. In that respect, horse flies, deer flies, and to a lesser extent, stable flies are likely the most efficient vectors. It is also because they are capable of triggering host defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in their seeking a new susceptible host to complete their blood meal."

Fly control is very important, in the barn and on the animal.

Currently there is no vaccine for EIA in the US. There is a vaccine developed in China and used in other places (see Equine infectious anemia - USA (04): (KY) unlicensed vaccine 20150915.3645562).
