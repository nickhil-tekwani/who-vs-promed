Israel health officials have been alerted to cases of measles that have been diagnosed in the northern city of Tzefas [Safed, Northern district], primarily in the chareidi community.

According to reports, the Health Ministry received reports of cases, most among chareidi children, who have since been in contact with members of the population. In the city's Rebecca Ziv Hospital, a 7-year-old chareidi boy was admitted due to the seriousness of his condition. He remains in isolation.

Health officials feel that in all likelihood, these cases could have been avoided in the parents had their children vaccinated as recommended by the ministry. The ministry is now calling on the non-vaccinated population to expeditiously have their children vaccinated as the illness is spreading. Children from 1-6 years old will receive one dose and from 6 upward, 2 doses of the vaccine.

"We hope that the leaders of the communities will send a strong message on the subject, and there is no reason for this disease to make a comeback," says a senior health official in Tzefas.

As for the measles symptoms and the risk of this disease, the head of the Pediatric Department at Ziv Prof. Anthony Luder explains: "Measles causes immediate and delayed complications, which are high fever lasting between 1 and 2 weeks, respiratory problems, pneumonia, and eye inflammation all over the body."

"The disease can develop into oxygen failure and death, and later complications, sometimes years after the disease, is a degeneration of the brain that causes untreated dementia," the professor emphasizes.

"Parents must follow the instructions of the Ministry of Health and the Israeli and International Medical Association, to vaccinate against measles at the age of one year, and if the children were not vaccinated in time, to go to the HMOs and vaccinate, parents should not take so much responsibility for the fate and health of their children."

[2] France: fatal

A 26-year-old patient has died in France from the measles, the 2nd fatality in a matter of months as an epidemic of the disease sweeps the country and health chiefs warn of the need to be immunised.

French health authorities revealed on [Wed 27 Jun 2018] that a 26-year-old patient had died from the disease, although details of the sex of the victim and the region where they lived have not been revealed.

Health chiefs from French health authority Sante Publique France said the patient's immune system was too weak to be given a vaccine and that they were probably contaminated by someone close to them who had not been vaccinated.

The death comes after a 32-year-old woman died in February [2018] in a hospital in the town of Poitiers from the disease, which causes skin rash and flu-like symptoms and can affect people of all ages, despite being considered primarily a childhood illness.

The woman had apparently contracted measles after taking her father to the CHU [university hospital center] in Poitiers [Vienne department, Nouvelle-Aquitaine region]. In all, there have been 22 deaths caused by measles in France since 2008.

Some 2567 cases of measles have been identified in France since November [2017] with the western and southern departments of Gironde, Vienne [Nouvelle-Aquitaine region], and the Gard [Occitanie region] the most affected. Although the number of new cases has dropped slightly it stands around 50 a week.

To put the figure in context, only 400 cases a year were detected between 2013 and 2015.

Between January and April 2018 half of the 1800 cases of measles declared in France were in the south west region of Nouvelle Aquitaine, which is by far the region in France the most impacted.

In 88 percent of cases, those who have contracted the disease have not been vaccinated, or completed the course of vaccinations. In 22 percent of cases patients have been hospitalized.

Health authorities in France have been raising the alarm about the need to be vaccinated against the extremely contagious disease. "The elimination of measles is a top priority for the World Health Organisation... To achieve that it is necessary to reach the goal of vaccinating 95 percent of people at risk," said Jerome Salomon from the Ministry of Health.

In France no department in the country has reached the 95 percent vaccination rate, health authorities say.

According to doctors the problem is that many in France -- potentially up to one million -- did not receive the necessary 2nd injection of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella).

"This 2nd dose is necessary for the elimination of the disease because between 7 percent and 8 percent of children do not react to the administration of the 1st vaccine," doctor Daniel Levy-Bruhl told Le Monde newspaper.

The people at greatest risk in France are those born after 1980, the year in which cases of the disease dropped dramatically, officials said. Most of those born before 1980 have probably already had the measles, which used to afflict hundreds of thousands of children each year in France, and are now immune.

Authorities are worried that the rate of vaccinations in the south western Nouvelle Aquitaine region is too low to cope with the epidemic. It is believed between 70 and 81 percent of the public are vaccinated in the region.

[Individuals who are immunocompromised, pregnant, or have medical problems preventing safe vaccination can be protected from infection with wildtype virus when the general population is highly immune, creating a shield of herd immunity. Unfortunately, the proportion of the population in France and other countries who have been completely immunized with the MMR vaccine is below the level where herd immunity is effective, putting those who cannot or are not fully vaccinated at risk. - Mod.LK

A total of 200 cases were confirmed in the state of Roraima. While 177 more cases are currently under investigation, 35 cases have been discarded. It has been confirmed that 2 people have died from measles so far. Although the source of the outbreak has not been confirmed, some local authorities went as far as to blame the influx of Venezuelan immigrants for it, according to Agencia Brasil.

Brazil's Health Ministry has sent 700 000 doses of triple viral vaccine to both states in an effort to combat the highly contagious infectious disease.

Vaccination campaigns began in April [2018] in the state of Amazonas. The focus was geared toward in the metropolitan area of Manaus and cities with more than 75 000 residents and areas near the border with Venezuela. In Roraima, vaccination campaigns took place during the months of March and April [2018]. A total of 112 000 doses of vaccination were administered. ...
