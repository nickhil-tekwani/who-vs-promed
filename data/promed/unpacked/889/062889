Florida
- New cases. 16 Sep 2016. (conf.) 93 locally acquired cases; local Zika transmission area tripled in South Beach/Miami Beach area; 5 mosquito pools positive.
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/florida-triples-zika-transmission-area-as-new-cases-reported/

- Wynwood (Miami) CDC advice. 19 Sep 2016. (reported) No new cases of locally transmitted Zika have been reported in the Wynwood-designated area since early August [2016], and low numbers of mosquitoes have been found in traps there for the past several weeks since aerial application of the larvicide Bti and the adulticide Naled. CDC's update modifies the [1 Aug 2016] guidance that advised pregnant women to avoid travel to the Wynwood-designated area. CDC's revised guidance for the Wynwood-designated area is that:
- Pregnant women and their partners living in or traveling to the area should follow steps to prevent mosquito bites.
- Pregnant women and partners of pregnant women who are concerned about potential Zika virus exposure may also consider postponing nonessential travel to all parts of Miami-Dade County.
- Women and men who lived in or traveled to the area should be aware this location was considered an area of active Zika virus transmission from [15 Jun-18 Sep 2016]. Pregnant women should talk to their doctor or other healthcare provider about getting tested for Zika; and people who have a pregnant sex partner should consistently and correctly use condoms to prevent passing Zika during sex or they should not have sex during the pregnancy.
- Women and men who do not have signs or symptoms of Zika and who traveled to the area from [15 Jun-18 Sep 2016] should wait at least 8 weeks before trying to get pregnant.
- Men who had signs or symptoms of Zika or were diagnosed with Zika and who traveled to the area from [15 Jun-18 Sep 2016] should wait at least 6 months before trying to get their partner pregnant.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Background
The microcephaly epidemic, which started in Brazil in 2015, was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO in 2016. We report the preliminary results of a case-control study investigating the association between microcephaly and Zika virus infection during pregnancy.

Methods
We did this case-control study in 8 public hospitals in Recife, Brazil. Cases were neonates with microcephaly. 2 controls (neonates without microcephaly), matched by expected date of delivery and area of residence, were selected for each case. Serum samples of cases and controls and cerebrospinal fluid samples of cases were tested for Zika virus-specific IgM and by quantitative RT-PCR. Laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection during pregnancy was defined as detection of Zika virus-specific IgM or a positive RT-PCR result in neonates. Maternal serum samples were tested by plaque reduction neutralisation assay for Zika virus and dengue virus. We estimated crude odds ratios (ORs) and 95 percent CIs [confidence intervals] using a median unbiased estimator for binary data in an unconditional logistic regression model. We estimated ORs separately for cases with and without radiological evidence of brain abnormalities.

Findings
Between 15 Jan 2016, and 2 May 2016, we prospectively recruited 32 cases and 62 controls. 24 (80 percent) of 30 mothers of cases had Zika virus infection compared with 39 (64 percent) of 61 mothers of controls (p=0·12). 13 (41 percent) of 32 cases and none of 62 controls had laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection; crude overall OR 55·5 (95 percent CI 8.6-infinity); OR 113.3 (95 percent CI 14.5-infinity) for 7 cases with brain abnormalities; and OR 24.7 (95 percent CI 2.9-infinity) for 4 cases without brain abnormalities.

Interpretation
Our data suggest that the microcephaly epidemic is a result of congenital Zika virus infection. We await further data from this ongoing study to assess other potential risk factors and to confirm the strength of association in a larger sample size.

[3] Virus in conjunctival fluid

Ref: Sun J, Wu D, Zhong H, et al: Presence of Zika virus in conjunctival fluid. JAMA Ophthalmol. 2016; doi:10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2016.3417
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus isolated from the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947. The clinical symptoms of ZIKV infection are mostly a mild and self-limited rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis in humans. More than 80 percent of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic. The ZIKV outbreaks in Brazil and French Polynesia indicate that the virus is linked to microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Meanwhile, severe eye damage in infants with microcephaly was associated with ZIKV infection. However, it is still unclear whether the eye lesions are the result of microcephaly or directly from ZIKV infection. Therefore, we wondered whether ZIKV could be detected in conjunctival fluid. In this report, we describe the detection of ZIKV from conjunctival swab samples of laboratory-confirmed ZIKV cases.

Discussion
Detection of ZIKV RNA is a gold standard of confirmation of ZIKV infection. In this study, we described the direct detection and isolation of ZIKV from conjunctival swab samples. Although isolation of ZIKV in cell culture from urine, semen, saliva, and breast milk has been described, to our knowledge, detection and isolation of ZIKV from conjunctiva has not been reported so far. These results, though, are not sufficient to recommend the use of conjunctival swabs as alternative samples for ZIKV diagnosis because of shorter persisting and shedding time of ZIKV in conjunctiva fluid (less than 7 days) compared with urine and saliva samples (less than 20 days). It may have implications for transmission of ZIKV, such as, through corneal graft donors, although this report does not provide direct evidence to support that indication. Nevertheless, epidemiological data and experimental studies are needed to assess the further significance of this finding because of increasing complications caused by ZIKV infection in neonates.

[4] Placental barrier

http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/PressRelease/pressReleaseId-128223.html


Research provides clues to how Zika virus breaches the placental barrier
----------------------------------------------------------------------
New research reveals that in pregnant women, Zika virus infection damages certain cells that affect placental formation and function. Furthermore, herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) infection augments placental sensitivity to Zika virus by enhancing the expression of receptors that allow Zika virus to enter cells.

The findings may help explain the mechanism by which Zika virus breaches the placental barrier to access the fetus. They also suggest that fetuses in pregnant women with HSV-2 infection are at a higher risk for microcephaly and other effects caused by Zika virus.

"Investigators in Brazil have suspected that something more than Zika virus is causing the high intensity and severity of cases. Our study suggests that the immune response to an early infection, HSV-2, may be the additional factor that increases the risk for severity of Zika virus-induced disease," said Dr Gil Mor, senior author of the American Journal of Reproductive Immunology study.

Ref: Hall-Mendelin S, Pyke AT, Moore PR, et al: Assessment of local mosquito species incriminates _Aedes aegypti_ as the potential vector of Zika virus in Australia. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2016; 10(9): e0004959. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0004959. eCollection 2016 Sep.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
Background
Within the last 10 years Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused unprecedented epidemics of human disease in the nations and territories of the western Pacific and South America, and continues to escalate in both endemic and non-endemic regions. We evaluated the vector competence of Australian mosquitoes for ZIKV to assess their potential role in virus transmission.

Methodology/Principal findings
Mosquitoes were exposed to infectious blood meals containing the prototype African ZIKV strain. After 14 days incubation at 28 deg C [82 deg F] and high relative humidity, infection, dissemination and transmission rates were assessed. Infection in _Culex annulirostris_ and _Cx. sitiens_ could not be detected. 8 percent of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ were infected, but the virus did not disseminate in this species. Despite having infection rates higher than 50 percent, _Aedes notoscriptus_ and _Ae. vigilax_ did not transmit ZIKV. In contrast, _Ae. aegypti_ had infection and transmission rates of 57 and 27 percent, respectively. In susceptibility trials, the virus dose required to infect 50 percent (ID50) of _Ae. aegypti_ was 10^6.4 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50)/mL. Additionally, a threshold viral load within the mosquito of at least 10^5.1 TCID50 equivalents/mL had to be reached before virus transmission occurred.

Conclusions/Significance
We confirmed _Ae. aegypti_ to be the most likely mosquito vector of ZIKV in Australia, although the restricted distribution of this species will limit the receptive zone to northern Queensland where this species occurs. Importantly, the role in ZIKV transmission of _Culex_ and other _Aedes_ spp tested will be negligible. Despite being the implicated vector, the relatively high ID50 and need for a high titer disseminated infection in _Ae. aegypti_ suggest that high mosquito population densities will be required to facilitate epidemic ZIKV transmission among the currently immunologically naïve human population in Australia.

Author summary
Zika virus was first isolated in Uganda in 1947 and exists in a transmission cycle between mosquitoes and non-human primates or humans. Whilst most clinical infections result in a self-limiting febrile illness, Zika virus has recently been linked to neurological syndromes, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and congenital birth defects. Since 2007, Zika virus has undergone a dramatic range expansion, causing epidemics in nations and territories of the western Pacific and South America. To assess the emergence and transmission risk of Zika virus emerging in Australia, we evaluated the ability of local mosquitoes to become infected with and transmit the prototype African Zika virus strain. In agreement with its substantiated role in Zika virus transmission overseas, Australian _Aedes aegypti_ were shown to be competent vectors. Coupled with its anthropophilic feeding behavior, this species should be considered the primary potential Zika virus vector in Australia. Although other common Australian species, such as _Ae. notoscriptus_ and _Ae. vigilax_, were readily infected, they did not transmit the virus. The species of _Culex_ tested were either refractory to infection or had a low infection rate. We also demonstrated that the Zika virus dose necessary to infect _Ae. aegypti_ was higher than virus levels reported in infected humans. Finally, a high threshold level of virus circulating through the mosquito body was required before _Ae. aegypti_ transmitted the virus. These results suggest that an outbreak of Zika virus in Australia would require high mosquito population densities and a susceptible human population.

[These findings further implicate _Aedes aegypti_ as the main vector of Zika virus. It is reassuring to learn that _Culex quinquefasciatus_ is not a vector of the virus, in agreement with other studies except the one below, given its wide geographic distribution.

Ref: Guo XX, Li CX, Deng YQ, et al: _Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus_: a potential vector to transmit Zika virus.
Emerg Microbes Infect. 2016; 5(9): e102. doi: 10.1038/emi.2016.102.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Zika virus (ZIKV) has become a threat to global health since the outbreak in Brazil in 2015. Although ZIKV is generally considered an Aedes-transmitted pathogen, new evidence has shown that parts of the virus closely resemble _Culex_-transmitted viruses. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the competence of _Culex_ species for ZIKV to understand their potential as vectors. In this study, female _Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus_ were orally exposed to ZIKV. Mosquito midguts, salivary glands, and ovaries were tested for ZIKV to measure infection and dissemination at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 18 days post exposure (pe). In addition, saliva was collected from mosquitoes after infection and infant mice were bitten by infected mosquitoes to measure the transmission ability of _Cx. p. quinquefasciatus_. The results showed that the peak time of virus appearance in the salivary glands was day 8 pe, with 90 percent infection rate and an estimated virus titer of 3.92+/-0.49 lg RNA copies/mL. 8 of the 9 infant mice had positive brains after being bitten by infected mosquitoes, which meant that _Cx. p. quinquefasciatus_ could be infected with and transmit ZIKV following oral infection. These laboratory results clearly demonstrate the potential role of _Cx. p. quinquefasciatus_ as a vector of ZIKV in China. Because there are quite different vector management strategies required to control _Aedes (Stegomyia)_ species and _Cx. p. quinquefasciatus_, an integrated approach may be required should a Zika epidemic occur.

[These results contradict the findings of 3 previous reports that indicate that _Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus_ are either refractory to Zika virus infection or with limited replication, with the conclusion that they are not efficient Zika virus vectors. It is difficult to explain the differing results of those studies with those of this one. - Mod.TY]
