The source of the recent emergence of anthrax in Armenia was the slaughtering of an animal [presumably a sick cow] in a courtyard of Tsovak village nearby Vardenis district of the Gegharkunik [Gelarkunik] Region, the Agriculture Ministry's Veterinary Inspectorate Chief Hovhannes Mkrtchyan stated during a press conference on Wednesday [24 Oct 2012].

In his words, the alarm was received on 15 Oct 2012, when a man with symptoms of anthrax was taken to hospital. "The circumstances showed that a courtyard [animal] slaughter was carried out, [and] as a result, that man was infected from the meat of the sick animal," Mkrtchyan said.

Hovhannes Mkrtchyan assured that there are no contaminated animals in Tsovak and in the neighboring villages, at present, and vaccinations [of livestock. - Mod.JW] were carried out.

[I am presuming it was a bovine source because a butchered sick sheep would not have been big enough to have exposed some 22 individuals in this incident. Otherwise it is a classic anthrax event involving humans. Thanks to Susan and Tamas Torok for this report. - Mod.MHJ
