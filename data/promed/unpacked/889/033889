The health department has succeeded in bringing down the [number of] scrub typhus cases in north Kerala except in the 2 districts of Kozhikode and Wayanad. Both the districts have been witnessing a spike in scrub typhus, also known as rickettsia fever, which is considered an emerging disease in south India.

The disease, spread from animals to humans, is transmitted through mites found in bushes and gardens. The bite transmits the organism _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, found in gardens, forests, wet grass and agricultural lands, which causes the infection. If undetected, the fever will lead to complications such as encephalitis, pneumonia and renal failure, resulting [in] death of the affected person.

According to the district health department, the district [Kozhikode?] has reported a total of 26 scrub typhus cases from January to August 2015. The Wayanad district had reported 2 deaths and another 40 scrub typhus cases from January to August 2015. The district had reported 32 cases in Kozhikode and 10 cases in Wayanad in 2014. The year 2013 saw 4 cases in the district and 6 in Wayanad.

But the health experts say that greater awareness among public resulted in apt reporting of the diseases.

Retired district medical officer Dr P K Mohanan said that the detection rate of disease is high in the district compared to other districts in North Kerala, as the district has the facility to carry out tests for the detection of the disease. "Another main reason for the growing number is that the number of people working on farm land and estates is higher in the districts of Wayanad and Kozhikode compared to other northern region districts," he said. "The intensive awareness about the disease also resulted in people approaching for treatment once they find symptoms." he said.

Meanwhile, district medical officer Dr K Narayana Nayak said that those who have been [having] symptoms of prolonged fever, severe body ache and headache, dry cough and breathlessness and chest pain need to immediately consult a nearby doctor. "The people started approaching health experts as there is greater awareness about the disease. We have already issued warnings to officials to keep vigilant," he said.
