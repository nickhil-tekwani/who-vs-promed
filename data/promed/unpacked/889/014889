Dengue/DHF - El Salvador (02): Alert 991103145231

From: Jose_Campione@hc-sc.gc.ca

The recent message on DHF in El Salvador indicates that: Since plasma
supplies at the Red Cross and in hospitals were limited, the Health
Ministry called on the people to donate blood. Given the experience in
other countries, [this may be a cause for concern.
In recent years, the emergence of DHF/DSS in some Caribbean countries
revealed a tendency to overindulge in the transfusion of whole blood and to
prescribe it together with platelet concentrates as soon as the DHF
diagnosis was presumed. The impression is that many of these transfusions
may have been a reaction to the "haemorrhagic" adjective in the diagnosis
name, and not fully justified by the actual bleeding, the condition of the
patient, or the pathogenesis and proper management of the disease. Perhaps
it should be stressed once again that DHF - different than true Viral
Haemorrhagic Fevers - is more hypovolemic than haemorrhagic and that if
DHF patients are properly diagnosed and managed during their hypovolemic
stages only a very small number of them would require transfusions of whole
blood.
