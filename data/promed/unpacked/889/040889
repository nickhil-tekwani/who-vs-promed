Consumers advised to avoid raw oysters from the Pacific Northwest
-----------------------------------------------
The FDA is advising consumers to avoid eating raw oysters harvested in the
Pacific Northwest [of the USA] as a result of reports that some of the
oysters recently harvested from that region were contaminated with _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_ (Vp), a bacterium that can cause gastrointestinal illness.
Until the threat of Vp from oysters harvested in the Pacific Northwest has
passed, consumers are advised to thoroughly cook oysters harvested from
that area before eating. They also should thoroughly cook oysters if they
are not certain of the oysters' origin or if they wish to further reduce
their risk of infection from bacteria that may be found in raw oysters.
In recent months, there has been an unusual increase in bacterial illness
associated with eating raw oysters from the Pacific Northwest [see previous
posts in "see also." - Mod.LL]. The illnesses are associated with the
naturally occurring bacterium Vp, which is most prevalent during summer
months when water temperatures in the Pacific Northwest are most favorable
for its growth. While Vp can cause mild gastrointestinal disorders in
healthy individuals, older persons and those with weak immune systems are
at greater risk for more serious illness, such as septicemia (infection of
the blood system).
Pacific Northwest oysters are distributed nationally. Although to date,
most of the illnesses reported have occurred in the Pacific Northwest, some
have been reported in New York state as well.
In Washington state, shellfish control authorities are identifying and
closing areas where people have become sick from eating oysters. Washington
state has initiated a recall of all shell stock oysters (oysters in the
shell) harvested from areas closed within the state. Because of the
potential for nationwide distribution, consumers are advised to follow
recall instructions and return associated shell stock oysters to the
retailer from which they were purchased.
Cooking destroys the bacteria, eliminating the risk of illness for both
healthy and immunocompromised individuals. The majority of illnesses that
occur from the consumption of raw oysters are not life-threatening to the
general population and commonly range from mild intestinal disorders of
short duration to acute gastroenteritis. The symptoms are watery diarrhea,
often with abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills. Usually
these symptoms occur within 24 hours of ingestion and last no more than 3
days. Severe disease is rare and occurs most commonly in persons with
weakened immune systems. Persons with weakened immune systems, including
those affected by AIDS, and persons with chronic alcohol abuse, liver,
stomach or blood disorders, cancer, diabetes, or kidney disease should
avoid raw oyster consumption altogether, regardless of where the oysters
are harvested.
Consumers can continue to enjoy oysters in many cooked preparations by
following this advice:
At restaurants and other foodservice establishments:
- order oysters fully cooked.
In the shell:
- purchase oysters with the shells closed. Throw away any oysters with
shells already opened.
- boil oysters until the shells open. Once open boil for an additional 3-5
minutes.
- steamer - add oysters to water that is already steaming and cook live
oysters until the shells open, once open, steam for another 4-9 minutes.
- use smaller pots to boil or steam oysters. Using larger pots or cooking
too many oysters at one time may cause uneven heat distribution, which may
cause the oysters in the middle to not get fully cooked.
- discard any oysters that do not open during cooking.
Shucked oysters:
- boil or simmer shucked oysters for at least 3 minutes or until the edges
curl. - Fry at 375 degrees for at least 3 minutes.
- broil 3 inches from heat for 3 minutes.
- bake at 450 F for 10 minutes.
