Korea decided Monday [3 Jan 2011] to greatly expand animal
vaccinations to stem outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], which
continues to spread throughout the country despite nationwide
quarantine efforts, the government said.

Farm Minister Yoo Jeong-bok said in a news briefing that shots will
be administered to all animals in Gyeonggi Province surrounding Seoul
and large parts of Chungcheong in the country's central region. [Does
"all animals" relate to other species besides cattle? Which age
groups are included? - Mod.AS].

He added that vaccines are to be given to animals in mountainous
Gangwon Province to the east of the capital city along with North
Gyeongsang Province on Korea's southeastern coast, which reported the
1st outbreaks. "Areas that are vulnerable to the spread of the animal
disease will be given vaccines as a precautionary step, even if no
FMD cases have been reported," he said.

The announcement means that Seoul is moving to effectively vaccinate
the entire country, since Jeolla Province on the country's
southwestern coast and the resort island of Jeju are the only regions
that have not been hit by FMD so far.

Following the confirmation of the 1st outbreak on 29 Nov 2010, a
total of 82 cases [outbreaks, infected farms] have been reported,
along with a few other outbreaks that are not officially counted
since the animals were culled before test results came in.

Quarantine authorities have ordered the culling and burial of more
than 668 000 head of cattle, pigs, goats and deer in 5 provinces and
the port city of Incheon, 40 km east of Seoul [numbers of culled
animals per species are requested. - Mod.AS].

The latest move comes after the government originally said on 22 Dec
2010 that it will carry out limited vaccinations on cattle to contain
the contagious animal disease.

The latest FMD outbreak has spread through 5 provinces and Incheon,
the country's 2nd-largest seaport. More than 500 000 livestock [which
species? what age limits?] are slated to receive vaccines, although
the numbers may go up in the coming days.

Vaccinations are only used as a last resort due to extra costs and
because it will require more time for the country to regain its
"FMD-free status" from the Paris-based World Organisation for Animal
Health [see commentary].

The farm ministry, meanwhile, confirmed 5 fresh outbreaks earlier in the day.

A pig farm in Boryeong and a milk cow farm in Cheonan, 170 km and 90
km south of Seoul, respectively, tested positive for FMD, the
ministry said. The outbreaks bring the total to 4 in the province
after the 1st was reported over the weekend. Quarantine authorities
added that a small cattle farm in Chuncheon, 85 km east of the
capital city, and 2 cow farms in North Gyeongsang all confirmed FMD
cases after animals started showing symptoms that included excessive
drooling, blisters on the snouts and hooves on Sunday [2 Jan 2011].

All 189 head of cattle on the 4 farms and 23 000 pigs have been
ordered destroyed, with other livestock within a 500-meter radius of
both farms ordered culled and buried as a precautionary move.

FMD is highly contagious and affects all cloven-hoofed animals, such
as cattle, pigs, deer, goats and buffalo.

In response to the relentless spread of FMD, officials in Guri and
Pocheon, in Gyeonggi, said they will temporarily shut down theaters
and outdoor public facilities after the highly contagious virus
infected a number of livestock in 7 cities in Gyeonggi.

The Guri city government said yesterday [3 Jan 2011] that it will
close the government-run Wangsook Sports Park, a 58 000-square-meter
facility with grass fields and tennis courts, until the virus' spread eases.

The city faced heightened risk from the disease when neighboring
Namyangju had its 1st outbreak of the virus on Friday [31 Dec 2010].

The restrictions are aimed in part at protecting the Sanori farm,
which raises about 200 cows.

"The Sanori farm is only one meter from Wangsook Sports Park," said
Park Yun-seon, director of the city's Agriculture Policy Bureau. "The
farm and the park are within a 5-km (3 mile) radius of the outbreak
of FMD in Namyangju."

Pocheon, north of Namyangju, also increased its preventive measures
against the virus, canceling and postponing this month's [January
2011] art performances and movies.

The city said yesterday [3 Jan 2011] that it will refund money paid
for all performances at Banweol Art Hall that are canceled or delayed
due to the restrictions.

So far, 7 cities in northern Gyeonggi, including Namyangju, verified
that their farms were infected with FMD.

The virus has also spread into Boryeong, South Chungcheong, where a
hog farm tested positive for the disease yesterday [3 Jan 2011].
About 130 cows are currently being raised within a 500-meter radius
of the epicenter in Boryeong, health authorities said.

Concerns are growing in Hongseong, which has the largest number of
livestock of any county in the country, with 450 000 pigs and 45 000 cows.

The Hongseong county office raised the number of quarantine posts
from 8 to 12 to protect its largest hog and cattle farm, located only
3 km from the outbreak in Boryeong.

Health authorities said vaccinations will be given out in FMD-free
regions in an attempt to prevent the spread of FMD.

"Yongin and Pyeongtaek have large-scale farms," Yoo Jeong-bok,
Minister for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, said Sunday
[2 Jan 2011]. "We are considering giving vaccines in these regions."

Meanwhile, the spread of avian influenza A (H5N1) has been halted,
according to authorities.

[S. Korea's follow-up report No. 7, including a map, has been
submitted to the OIE on 31 Dec 2010. It covers a total of 11 new
outbreaks, with 27 140 susceptible swine and 675 susceptible cattle,
of which, respectively, 9 and 23 cases were reported, no mortalities,
all destroyed. The very small number of reported "cases" in swine
(0.03 percent "apparent morbidity") is puzzling (or are these only
the sampled animals?).

The report included the following "epidemiological comments": Cattle
and pigs in the affected farms and within 500 meters around the
affected farms have been culled and buried as a preemptive measure.
Emergency vaccination against FMD (cattle only) has been conducted
since 25 Dec 2010. Vaccination is limited in some areas in
Gyeongsanbuk-do, Gangwon-do and Gyeonggi-do". A map, with all 61
outbreaks since the start of the epizootic, end November 2010, is
available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9993>.

Item 1 above includes the statement, "Vaccinations are only used as a
last resort due to extra costs and because it will require more time
for the country to regain its "FMD-free status" from the Paris-based
World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)". Another Korean daily,
Korea Times, included the following statement on 3 Jan 2011: "The
government started vaccinating animals susceptible to FMD last week.
But the use of vaccines is still limited for fear that wider use
could put local beef dealers at a disadvantage in exporting their
products". These statements, reflecting the background to the
decision to apply vaccination in Korea, apparently restricted in
geographical and species (cattle only?) terms, deserve to be
meticulously analysed. Does vaccination mean, as stated, "extra
costs" or an economically-justified disease control measure, compared
to the applied stamping out policy?

To assess the claimed negative effect of vaccination upon exports,
updated information about the actual, accurate quantitative and
financial dimensions of Korea's exports (live animals, beef, pork) will help.

With the given figures of "more than 668 000 head of cattle, pigs,
goats and deer" culled/destroyed, this epizootic seems to be underway
to catch up with Britain's 2001 FMD epizootic culling figures.
Closing of public events, such as the one described above, is also
reminiscent of the British experience. - Mod.AS]
