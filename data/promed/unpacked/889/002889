Health officials in Dominica have warned of a new outbreak of leptospirosis on the island. They have confirmed 5 new cases of the disease and are encouraging residents to take action to avert its spread.

The latest outbreak comes just one year after a similar outbreak was brought under control. However, it was not before more than 50 persons contracted the disease, and there were 7 confirmed deaths. Among those who succumbed to the disease at the time was a leading official of the agriculture ministry.

Health officials have blamed the high incidence of rodents all over the island as the most likely reason for the spread. The disease can cause severe fever, headache, muscle aches, abdominal pains, and vomiting. The infection is commonly transmitted to humans by allowing water that has been contaminated by animal urine to come into contact with unhealed breaks in the skin, the eyes, or with the mucous membranes.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals, or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. These animals are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of pathogenic _Leptospira_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life. Leptospira bacteria shed in urine may survive in water or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) are susceptible to chronic urinary infection with pathogenic leptospira. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals, for example, farmers, sewer workers, veterinarians, dairy farmers, rice and sugarcane field workers, and military personnel. It is a recreational hazard for those who participate in outdoor water sports such as swimming, rowing, or whitewater rafting in contaminated lakes and rivers.

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can provide _Leptospira_ Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) to local laboratories for serological testing of suspected leptospirosis cases in support of the response to a disaster. The DST is suitable for in-the-field testing of suspected patients. Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT).

Dominica, with a population of 71 293 at the 2011 census, is an island nation in the Lesser Antilles region of the Caribbean Sea, south-southeast of Guadeloupe and northwest of Martinique (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominica).
