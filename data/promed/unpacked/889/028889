The original post included a machine translation of the article that mentioned "...experts at Guangdong Province CDC provisionally confirmed the event was caused by bongkrekic acid poisoning."

According to the revised translation below, "...the incident was caused by rice yeast acidosis."

ProMED apologizes for the error in translation that misidentified the toxin as bongkrekic acid, which can form on rice but does not necessarily produce the clinical signs noted in the original article. - Mod.TG

Suspected food poisoning occurred in a rice rolls store in Guangdong and 1 death: preliminary verdict is rice yeast acidosis

In response to the "suspected food poisoning incident at a rice roll in Huilai County", on the afternoon of 3 Aug 2020, a staff member of the Health Bureau of Huilai County, Jieyang City, Guangdong Province told The Paper the provincial disease control expert initially determined the incident was caused by rice yeast acidosis.

In the afternoon of the same day, a staff member of the Huilai County Market Supervision Administration told The Paper among the 11 customers who had symptoms of food poisoning in the aforementioned incident, there were minors. The City Supervision Bureau is investigating the aforementioned incident.

In the early morning of 2 Aug 2020 the Huilai County People's Government issued a notice on its official website. On 28 Jul 2020 a suspected food poisoning incident occurred in Shenquan Town, Huilai County. According to preliminary investigations, 11 customers in Shenquan Township experienced vomiting, diarrhea, and other suspected food poisoning symptoms after eating Pho (commonly known as "Kui Tiao") at the "Stone Rice Noodle Store" at noon on the 28 Jul 2020. At present, 5 people have been sent to the doctor for treatment (1 of them died after full rescue and treatment failed, 2 were in serious condition, and 2 were in stable condition), and another 6 people were treated and observed in their place of residence due to mild symptoms and their condition was stable.

The aforementioned notification stated the owner of the rice noodle shop and the supplier of pho (Kui Teow) are currently under the control of the county public security authority and are assisting in the investigation of the incident. The batch of rice noodles (Kui Tiao) manufacturers are Qunli Food Factory, Chaoyang District, Shantou City, which was closed on 1 Aug 2020. On the evening of the same day, the provincial disease control expert team arrived in Huilai County to guide and assist Huilai County to continue to do its best in the treatment and follow-up investigation of suspected food poisoning personnel, to find out the cause of the incident, and to strengthen the traceability of the ingredients involved. Huilai County has initiated emergency response to Level IV food safety incidents, and incident handling is being carried out in an intense and orderly manner.

At 17:00 on the 2 Aug 2020 the official public account of the Publicity Department of Huilai County Party Committee released the "Food Safety Consumption Tips." The aforementioned article stated all the rice noodles (kuey teow) sold by the "Stone rice noodles store" involved in the rice noodle store came from a supplier in the area near the power supply station in Shenquan Town (the operator Fang Mou sees ). On 27 Jul 2020 Fang bought kuey teow from Qunli Food Factory in Chaoyang District, Shantou City and sold it locally from 28 Jul to 31 Jul 2020. It was preliminarily found most of it had been sold. If a business or individual bought pho (Kui Teow) from Fang Moujian during this time period but it has not been distributed or eaten, the ingredients should be sealed immediately and reported to the village (community); if there are consumers from [28 to 31 Jul 2020] who ate rice noodles (Kui Teow) at the "Stone Rice Rolls Store", or bought them directly from Fang Moujian, ate the rice noodles (Kway Teow), and have symptoms such as vomiting, dizziness, and diarrhea, seek medical attention in time and report to the village (community) where you live.

Previously, the official public account of the Guangdong Provincial Market Supervision Administration published an article on 1 Aug 2020 "Guangdong provincial market supervision administration issues consumption reminder: beware of poisoning by rice yeast acid toxin". According to the article, Guangdong Province has entered the hot and humid weather recently. Pho, rice noodles (rolling noodles), Chencun noodles, Kuey teow, rice noodles, sage noodles, and other wet rice noodles, white fungus, and fungus are vulnerable to coconut poison. Pollution caused by spore bacteria produces acid toxin. _Pseudomonas_ spp coconut toxin is widespread in nature. If the above-mentioned foods are not stored in a timely manner or exceed the shelf life, the risk of acid toxin poisoning caused by rice yeast will increase. In order to prevent rice yeast acid toxin poisoning, the Guangdong Provincial Market Supervision Administration reminded consumers should choose formal channels when purchasing wet rice noodles and other foods, and that household preparations should pay attention to refrigerated storage and timely consumption. If poisoning is suspected, you should stop eating the suspicious food immediately, induce vomiting as soon as possible, and discharge the stomach contents to reduce the absorption of toxins and damage to the body, and promptly send to the hospital for treatment and symptomatic treatment.

[Alikely culprit in this incident is _bacillus cereus_ known to be responsible for rice associated foodborne disease. "_Bacillus cereus_ is a toxin-producing bacteria, which is one of the most common causes of food poisoning, also called "fried rice syndrome."

"However, the vast majority of cases go unreported, because the symptoms are generally mild and subside on their own with rest and hydration.

"Leftover fried rice is a primary culprit, said Philip Tierno, a microbiologist and clinical professor at New York University Langone Health. After the rice is cooked, it is often left at room temperature for more than 2 hours to cool before frying it with other ingredients. Cooling the rice ensures that the finished fried rice won't get clumpy or become soggy. But reheating it doesn't get rid of the toxins the bacteria have already produced.

"The bacteria release 2 types of toxins that each cause a different illness -- one causes diarrhea while the other toxin elicits vomiting, according to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Bad Bug Book (https://www.fda.gov/media/83271/download).

"The 1st type of toxin is released in the small intestine after the bacteria are ingested, and causes diarrhea, cramps, and occasionally nausea but rarely vomiting. Symptoms typically begin 6 to 15 hours after eating contaminated foods, which can include various meats, milk, vegetables or fish. The symptoms typically subside after about a day.

"The 2nd type of toxin is released by the bacteria in the food before it's consumed. Starchy foods, such as rice, are the most common sources of food affected. The toxin causes vomiting and nausea within 30 minutes to 6 hours after eating the contaminated food. Symptoms subside after about 24 hours.

"Anyone is susceptible to illness caused by the bacteria. Doctors diagnose _B. cereus_ food poisoning by testing the patient's vomit or feces for the bacteria, then matching the strains of bacteria within the samples to either a known contaminated food source or strains known to cause illness, according to a 2018 review article.

"For most people who contract _B. cereus_, rest and keeping well-hydrated are enough to allow the body to rid the infection on its own, typically within a day. Complications, including aseptic meningitis, gangrene and cellulitis, typically occur only in people with compromised immune systems, those who have surgical wounds or people who use intravenous drugs.

"If medical treatment is required, doctors focus on treating the symptoms, such as by administering intravenous fluids for dehydration. Occasionally, antibiotics such as vancomycin are prescribed for serious cases when the bacteria hangs out in the digestive tract for too long, said Tierno.

"Keeping hot foods hot (above 140 deg F, or 60 deg C) and cold foods cold (lower than 40 deg F, or 4 deg C) is vital for decreasing the risk of contracting a _B. cereus_ illness, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services. Reheating or freezing any foods that have been left out for more than 2 hours may not prevent illness.

"_B. cereus_ naturally colonize on uncooked rice grains," Tierno said. The spores produced by the bacteria "easily survive the cooking process and grow best at room temperature."

Reheating foods to temperatures at or above 165 F (74 C) for 15 seconds will kill the cells but not the toxins, if they have already formed, according to 2017 article from the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences at the University of Florida. If any food is suspected of being contaminated, it should be thrown out." (https://www.livescience.com/65374-bacillus-cereus-fried-rice-syndrome.html)

The last paragraph of the media report mentions "pseudomonas coconut toxin". Pseudomonas is bacterial but when you link it to coconut and toxicity you are back to the Bongkrekic Acid discussion:

"Toxic Tempeh: Death by Bongkrekic Acid Nature's Poisons
[Search domain <naturespoisons.com/2015/07/09/toxic-tempeh-death-by-bongkrekic-acid/] https://naturespoisons.com/2015/07/09/toxic-tempeh-death-by-bongkrekic-acid/>.

Made from coconut, tempe bongkrek originates from the island of Java, a part of Indonesia. It is made by fermenting coconut presscake or coconut milk with the fungus Rhizopus oligosporus. When the mold grows, the thin, fluffy, vegetative strands called mycelia physically binds the coconut (or soybean, grain, etc.) together to form the cake, and ...
