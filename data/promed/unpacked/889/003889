One new case of Marburg virus infection have been confirmed by the
laboratory at the National Institute of Virology (South Africa). This case
was a woman who died 7 May in the isolation unit of the health centre. She
reportedly lived 20-30 km from Durba and preliminary investigation has not
established a link with other haemorrhagic fever cases or with mining
activities. Additional data about this case is being collected. The only
previously confirmed case was the medical officer who died 23 April.
The special committee established in Watsa to coordinate the investigation
now includes experts from the Ministry of Health and local health
authorities, WHO, Medecins sans frontieres (Belgium and Holland), UNDP,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Institut Pasteur (Madagascar,
French Guyana and France) and the Institute of Tropical Medicine (Holland).
The committee has established teams for logistical support; surveillance;
training local health staff in preventive and protective practices and
educating the local population in these practices; and for conducting
clinical, epidemiological, and virological research. The team aims to
determine the original source of the outbreak, identify any further cases
of suspected VHF, follow-up contacts of suspected cases and further
implement control measures.
A large serological survey of inhabitants in the affected area began today.
Also, an ecological team, consisting of experts from the National Institute
of Virology and the Danish Pest Infection Laboratory has started collecting
specimens from animals for virological studies.
