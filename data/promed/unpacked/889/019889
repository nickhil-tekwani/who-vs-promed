An 18 month old girl suffered swollen lymph nodes and fever after being bitten by a tick. The child had always been previously in good health.

A tick bit her at the left shoulder, during a trip to a Dutch island was reported in June 2019. The tick was completely removed the following day, but she developed fever and rash 2 days later. No other signs or symptoms followed until 15 Jul 2019 (approx. 30 days after the tick bite) a supraclavicular swelling appeared. This initially showed intact skin, but progressive increased in size and the overlying skin developed hyperemia. Three days after latter a left axillary swelling occurred as well. Since the child was temporarily in Italy, she was admitted at the Meyer Children's University Hospital in Florence.

Serology test for tularemia carried out at Meyer Children's Hospital and at Careggi Hospital in Florence were both positive. The molecular test carried out at the Microbiology Laboratory of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases "L. Spallanzani" in Rome detected the presence of _Francisella tularensis_ in surgical drainage. Further microbiological and molecular investigations are ongoing.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Bartolini and colleagues for this 1st hand report.

Tularemia can be transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbit) can produce the glandular, ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially [pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ("stadium") to the next] and transovarially [transmission of a pathogen from an organism (as a tick) to its offspring by infection of eggs in its ovary], making them efficient reservoirs and vectors. - Mod.LL
