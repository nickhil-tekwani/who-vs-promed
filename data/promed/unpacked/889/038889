Snake bites, human, Kathmandu, Nepal
---------------------------------------------
Over the past few days, there has been a sudden increase in the number of snakebite victims who visited Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) to receive medical treatment. The majority of these patients showed coagulopathy due to viper bites. The number of snakebite cases usually increases significantly during the monsoon season. A total of 60 snakebite victims were admitted in the month of June alone last year [2016]. More snakebite victims, therefore, are expected to be admitted to STIDH in the coming months.

[Hopefully there is adequate antivenin as viper snakes are toxic. Vipers are generally toxic in most parts of the world. In fact. Dr. Pun notes the patients showed coagulopathy. Antibiotics are often helpful as the fangs of a snake are extremely dirty 'injection instruments'. Other drugs for treating coagulopathies are also appropriate. Better yet would be an antivenin if one exists. Most antivenins are somewhat specific to a particular species of snake, and occasionally to a specific genus of snakes.

As the type of snake has not been specifically identified it is difficult comment on the snakes. However, it is quite possible the number of victims will likely increase from the past year at the same given time frame. - Mod.TG
