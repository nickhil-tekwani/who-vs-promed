[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 722 088 with 81 470 (11.3%) cases reported by China. There are now a total of 640 618 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 203 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 58 317 cases when compared with the data on 28 Mar 2020, with the USA accounting for 18 320 (31.4%), Italy for 5217 (8.9%), Spain for 6875 (11.8%) and Germany for 4740 (8.1%) of the newly confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside China now represents 88.7% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 19.7% of the global cases of COVID-19. The USA and Italy have surpassed China in total number of cases. A global total of 33 976 deaths have been reported, 30 672 (90.3%) outside mainland China.

It is now clear that while China has the largest population in the world, and was the original location where the COVID-19 outbreak started, it has markedly reduced transmission to a manageable level, now monitoring all arrivals in the country from outside. South Korea has slowly decreased daily new case counts hovering around 100 in recent days. The USA is now number one outside of China for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and Italy is number 2. Iran has slowed down in growth rate and Spain has been accelerating. To get an understanding of how rapidly things increase, look at Turkey. The 1st confirmed case was reported on 11 Mar 2020 and in 18 days the country has confirmed 9217 cases. - Mod.MPP]

[The Northern Mariana Islands are a Commonwealth of the USA and are located in the Western Pacific. Travel histories for the 2 confirmed cases have one traveling to Guam, but the other just traveled to other islands (Saipan and Tinian) in the Northern Marian Islands group, suggesting there may already have been undetected transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in the island group. A media report outlined the challenges faced by these USA territories (specifically the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa) where they do not have certified laboratories to permit them to test for the SARS-CoV-2, so specimens are sent to other locations including CDC, but not all suspected cases meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's criteria for testing.

[3] Lessons learned from Italy's experience
Date: Fri 27 Mar 2020

https://hbr.org/2020/03/lessons-from-italys-response-to-coronavirus


As policymakers around the world struggle to combat the rapidly escalating COVID-19 pandemic, they find themselves in uncharted territory. Much has been written about the practices and policies used in countries such as China, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan to stifle the pandemic. Unfortunately, throughout much of Europe and the United States, it is already too late to contain COVID-19 in its infancy, and policymakers are struggling to keep up with the spreading pandemic. In doing so, however, they are repeating many of the errors made early on in Italy, which has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic. The purpose of this article is to help US and European policymakers at all levels learn from Italy's experience so they can recognize and address the unprecedented challenges presented by the rapidly expanding crisis.

In a matter of weeks (from [21 Feb 2020] to [22 Mar 2020]), Italy went from the discovery of the 1st official COVID-19 case to a government decree that essentially prohibited all movements of people within the whole territory, and the closure of all non-essential business activities.

Some aspects of this crisis -- starting with its timing -- can undoubtedly be attributed to plain and simple _sfortuna_ ("bad luck" in Italian) that were clearly not under the full control of policymakers. Other aspects, however, are emblematic of the profound obstacles that leaders in Italy faced in recognizing the magnitude of the threat posed by COVID-19, organizing a systematic response to it, and learning from early implementation successes and failures.

It is worth emphasizing that these obstacles emerged after COVID-19 had [demonstrated its] impact in China and some alternative models for the containment of the virus (in China and elsewhere) had been successfully implemented. This suggests that existing information was not absorbed and acted upon rapidly and effectively, rather than [that there was] a complete lack of knowledge of what ought to be done.

Here are explanations for that failure -- which relate to the difficulties of making decisions in real time, when a crisis is unfolding -- and ways to overcome them.

Recognize your cognitive biases
-------------------------------
In its early stages, the COVID-19 crisis in Italy looked nothing like a crisis. The initial state-of-emergency declarations were met by skepticism by both the public and many in policy circles -- even though several scientists had been warning of the potential for a catastrophe for weeks. Indeed, in late February [2020] some notable Italian politicians engaged in public handshaking in Milan to make the point that the economy should not panic and stop because of the virus. (A week later, one of these politicians was diagnosed with COVID-19.)

Similar reactions were repeated across many other countries besides Italy and exemplify what behavioral scientists call confirmation bias -- a tendency to seize upon information that confirms our preferred position or initial hypothesis. Threats such as pandemics that evolve in a nonlinear fashion (that is, they start small but exponentially intensify) are especially tricky to confront because of the challenges of rapidly interpreting what is happening in real time. The most effective time to take strong action is extremely early, when the threat appears to be small -- or even before there are any cases. But if the intervention actually works, it will appear in retrospect as if the strong actions were an overreaction. This is a game many politicians don't want to play.

The systematic inability to listen to experts highlights the trouble that leaders -- and people in general -- have figuring out how to act in dire, highly complex situations where there's no easy solution. The desire to act causes leaders to rely on their gut feeling or the opinions of their inner circle. But in a time of uncertainty, it is essential to resist that temptation, and instead take the time to discover, organize, and absorb the partial knowledge that is dispersed across different pockets of expertise.

Avoid partial solutions
-----------------------
A 2nd lesson that can be drawn from the Italian experience is the importance of systematic approaches and the perils of partial solutions. The Italian government dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic by issuing a series of decrees that gradually increased restrictions within lockdown areas ("red zones"), which were then expanded until they ultimately applied to the entire country.

In normal times, this approach would probably be considered prudent and perhaps even wise. In this situation, it backfired for 2 reasons. First, it was inconsistent with the rapid exponential spread of the virus. The "facts on the ground" at any point in time were simply not predictive of what the situation would be just a few days later. As a result, Italy followed the spread of the virus rather than preventing it. Second, the selective approach might have inadvertently facilitated the spread of the virus. Consider the decision to initially lock down some regions but not others. When the decree announcing the closing of northern Italy became public, it touched off a massive exodus to southern Italy, undoubtedly spreading the virus to regions where it had not been present.

This illustrates what is now clear to many observers: an effective response to the virus needs to be orchestrated as a coherent system of actions taken simultaneously. The results of the approaches taken in China and South Korea underscore this point. While the public discussion of the policies followed in these countries often focuses on single elements of their models (such as extensive testing), what truly characterizes their effective responses is the multitude of actions that were taken at once. Testing is effective when it's combined with rigorous contact tracing, and tracing is effective as long as it is combined with an effective communication system that collects and disseminates information on the movements of potentially infected people, and so forth.

These rules also apply to the organization of the health care system itself. Wholesale reorganizations are needed within hospitals (for example, the creation of COVID-19 and non COVID-19 streams of care). In addition, a shift is urgently needed from patient-centered models of care to a community-system approach that offers pandemic solutions for the entire population (with a specific emphasis on home care). The need for coordinated actions is especially acute right now in the United States.

Learning is critical
--------------------
Finding the right implementation approach requires the ability to quickly learn from both successes and failures and the willingness to change actions accordingly. Certainly, there are valuable lessons to be learned from the approaches of China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, which were able to contain the contagion fairly early. But sometimes the best practices can be found just next door. Because the Italian health care system is highly decentralized, different regions tried different policy responses. The most notable example is the contrast between the approaches taken by Lombardy and Veneto, 2 neighboring regions with similar socioeconomic profiles.

Lombardy, one Europe's wealthiest and most productive areas, has been disproportionately hit by COVID-19. As of [26 Mar 2020], it held the grim record of nearly 35 000 novel coronavirus [COVID-19] cases and 5000 deaths in a population of 10 million. Veneto, by contrast, fared significantly better, with 7000 cases and 287 deaths in a population of 5 million, despite experiencing sustained community spread early on.

The trajectories of these 2 regions have been shaped by a multitude of factors outside the control of policymakers, including Lombardy's greater population density and higher number of cases when the crisis erupted. But it's becoming increasingly apparent that different public health choices made early in the cycle of the pandemic also had an impact.

Specifically, while Lombardy and Veneto applied similar approaches to social distancing and retail closures, Veneto took a much more proactive tack towards the containment of the virus. Veneto's strategy was multi-pronged:
- Extensive testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases early on.
- Proactive tracing of potential positives. If someone tested positive, everyone in that patient's home as well as their neighbors were tested. If testing kits were unavailable, they were self-quarantined.
- A strong emphasis on home diagnosis and care. Whenever possible, samples were collected directly from a patient's home and then processed in regional and local university labs.
- Specific efforts to monitor and protect health care and other essential workers. They included medical professionals, those in contact with at-risk populations (such as caregivers in nursing homes), and workers exposed to the public (such as supermarket cashiers, pharmacists, and protective services staff).

Following the guidance from public health authorities in the central government, Lombardy opted instead for a more conservative approach to testing. On a per capita basis, it has so far conducted half of the tests conducted in Veneto and had a much stronger focus only on symptomatic cases -- and has so far made limited investments in proactive tracing, home care and monitoring, and protection of health care workers.

The set of policies enacted in Veneto is thought to have considerably reduced the burden on hospitals and minimized the risk of COVID-19 spreading in medical facilities, a problem that has greatly impacted hospitals in Lombardy. The fact that different policies resulted in different outcomes across otherwise similar regions should have been recognized as a powerful learning opportunity from the start. The findings emerging from Veneto could have been used to revisit regional and central policies early on. Yet, it is only in recent days, a full month after the outbreak in Italy, that Lombardy and other regions are taking steps to emulate some of the aspects of the "Veneto approach", which include pressuring the central government to help them boost their diagnostic capacity.

The difficulty in diffusing newly acquired knowledge is a well-known phenomenon in both private- and public-sector organizations. But, in our view, accelerating the diffusion of knowledge that is emerging from different policy choices (in Italy and elsewhere) should be considered a top priority at a time when "every country is reinventing the wheel", as several scientists told us. For that to happen, especially at this time of heightened uncertainty, it is essential to consider different policies as if they were "experiments", rather than personal or political battles, and to adopt a mindset (as well as systems and processes) that facilitates learning from past and current experiences in dealing with COVID-19 as effectively and rapidly as possible.

It is especially important to understand what does not work. While successes easily surface thanks to leaders eager to publicize progress, problems often are hidden due to fear of retribution, or, when they do emerge, they are interpreted as individual -- rather than systemic -- failures. For example, it emerged that at the very early onset of the pandemic in Italy ([25 Feb 2020]), the contagion in a specific area in Lombardy could have been accelerated through a local hospital, where a COVID-19 patient was not been properly diagnosed and isolated. This incident [was attributed to] managerial inadequacy at the specific hospital. However, a month later the episode [seemed] emblematic of a much deeper issue: that hospitals traditionally organized to deliver patient-centric care are ill-equipped to deliver the type of community-focused care needed during a pandemic.

Collecting and disseminating data is important
----------------------------------------------
Italy seems to have suffered from 2 data-related problems. In the early onset of the pandemic, the problem was data paucity. More specifically, it has been suggested that the widespread and unnoticed diffusion of the virus in the early months of 2020 may have been facilitated by the lack of epidemiological capabilities and the inability to systematically record anomalous infection peaks in some hospitals.

More recently, the problem appears to be one of data precision. In particular, in spite of the remarkable effort that the Italian government has shown in regularly updating statistics relative to the pandemic on a publicly available website, some commentators have advanced the hypothesis that the striking discrepancy in mortality rates between Italy and other countries and within Italian regions may (at least in part) be driven by different testing approaches. These discrepancies complicate the management of the pandemic in significant ways, because in absence of truly comparable data (within and across countries) it is harder to allocate resources and understand what's working where (for example, what's inhibiting the effective tracing of the population).

In an ideal scenario, data documenting the spread and effects of the virus should be as standardized as possible across regions and countries and follow the progression of the virus and its containment at both a macro (state) and micro (hospital) level. The need for micro-level data cannot be overestimated. While the discussion of health care quality is often made in terms of macro entities (countries or states), it is well known that health care facilities vary dramatically in terms of the quality and quantity of the services they provide and their managerial capabilities, even within the same states and regions. Rather than hiding these underlying differences, we should be aware of them and plan the allocation of our limited resources accordingly. Only by having good data at the right level of analysis can policymakers and health care practitioners draw proper inferences about which approaches are working and which are not.

A different decision-making approach
------------------------------------
There is still tremendous uncertainty on what exactly needs to be done to stop the virus. Several key aspects of the virus are still unknown and hotly debated, and are likely to remain so for some time. Furthermore, significant lags occur between the time of action (or, in many cases, inaction) and outcomes (both infections and mortality). We need to accept that an unequivocal understanding of what solutions work is likely to take several months, if not years.

However, 2 aspects of this crisis appear to be clear from the Italian experience. First, there is no time to waste, given the exponential progression of the virus. As the head of the Italian Protezione Civile (the Italian equivalent of FEMA [US Federal Emergency Management Agency]) put it, "The virus is faster than our bureaucracy". Second, an effective approach towards COVID-19 will require a war-like mobilization -- both in terms of the entity of human and economic resources that will need to be deployed as well as the extreme coordination that will be required across different parts of the health care system (testing facilities, hospitals, primary care physicians, etc), between different entities in both the public and the private sector, and society at large.

Together, the need for immediate action and for massive mobilization imply that an effective response to this crisis will require a decision-making approach that is far from business as usual. If policymakers want to win the war against COVID-19, it is essential to adopt one that is systemic, prioritizes learning, and is able to quickly scale successful experiments and identify and shut down the ineffective ones. Yes, this a tall order -- especially in the midst of such an enormous crisis. But given the stakes, it has to be done.

[This is a fascinating review and identification of lessons to be learned from one country's experience. It has not been selected to serve as a criticism of a specific country, and I sincerely hope no offense is taken but rather a view from the eyes of business-oriented minds on lessons that could and should be learned, from a country's experiences.

The list of countries with accelerating transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 (the virus), resulting in rapidly increasing numbers of cases of COVID-19 (the disease) keeps growing (see section [1] above) and many of us in public health have been watching the political levels not always taking what public health would consider the best approaches or making the best choices. The business minds should speak out to the political minds who theoretically more closely approximate approaches to government. - Mod.MPP]

Highlights
----------
- One new country/territory/area reported cases of COVID-19 for the first time in the past 24 hours: The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

- The COVID-19 Solidarity Fund has now received donations of more than USD 108 million, from 203 000 individuals and organizations. To donate and for more information go to https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/donate.

- WHO, together with national authorities, is monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people's mental health, and providing information and guidance to governments and the public. On [27 Mar 2020], WHO European Region published an article on mental health and psychological resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic; highlighting the potential mental health impacts on children and the elderly. More information at http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/news/news/2020/3/mental-health-and-psychological-resilience-during-the-covid-19-pandemic.

These data come from Table 1: Countries, territories or areas with reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. Data as of [10:00 AM 29 Mar 2020], available at the source URL above. I am presenting the regional case totals without the addition of China for consistency in following trends in the regions. - Mod.MPP]

WHO region (no. countries/territories): Total confirmed cases (new) / Total deaths (new) / Transmission classification [no. countries] local / no. countries imported / no. countries under investigation

Other:
Cases on an international conveyance (Diamond Princess): 712 (0) / 7 (0) / Local / 0

Confirmed cases (new conf cases) / Total deaths (new deaths)
Sub-total: 551 767 (63 033) / 26 664 (3459) (excluding China and Diamond Princess)
Grand total (including China and Diamond Princess): 634 835 (63 159) / 29 957 (3464)

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 201. This includes 18 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 21 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 51 countries (including 16 territories) from the Americas region, and 41 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 20 485 new cases ( in the past 24 hours) of which 88.3% were reported by the USA, followed by Canada (3.6%) and Brazil (2.5%). The European region continues with rapid transmission, having confirmed 36 687 (58.2%) new cases and 2635 (79.6%) deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update, with Italy accounting for 16.3 % of newly confirmed cases, Spain for 22.3% of newly confirmed cases, Germany for 10.8% of newly confirmed cases, and France for 12.5% of newly confirmed cases (bringing the total of these 4 countries accounting for 62% of newly confirmed cases in Europe, down from 63.4% yesterday (28 Mar 2020). In the Eastern Mediterranean region, Iran reported 3076 new cases representing 80% of the regional newly reported cases. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia represent 7.6% and 2.6% respectively. In the African region, South Africa while representing 39.5% of total reported cases in the region, the newly reported cases in the past 24 hours only represented 9.8% of the regional total. Cote d'Ivoire represented 27.6% of newly reported cases in the region and Algeria 24.1%. In the Western Pacific region, Australia represents 27.2% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, with the Philippines representing 22.4% of the total (excluding China). In South East Asia, India reported 40.9% of newly confirmed cases followed by Thailand with 40.4% and Indonesia with 17.5%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [29 Mar 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. Looking at the curve, it looks as though Europe may be leveling off in numbers of daily newly confirmed cases while the USA has accelerated markedly in the past 2 days.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
