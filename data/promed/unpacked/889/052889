Lab tests detected the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu in
samples from Romanian ducks on Saturday, confirming the
virus had arrived for the first time in mainland Europe.
A British laboratory testing the samples established that 3
birds found dead in Romania's Danube delta last week
contained the strain, which has killed more than 60 people
and caused the death of millions of birds in Asia since
2003.
"We are now in a position to confirm it is H5N1," said a
spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs. The spokesman said the laboratory was continuing
to work to pin down the origin of the virus and the link to
a strain found in Turkey.
The Danube delta contains Europe's largest wetlands and is a
major way station for migratory wild birds coming from
Russia, Scandinavia, Poland and Germany and heading for
warmer North Africa, including the Nile delta, for winter.
"People must pay attention to our recommendations and they
have to be calm, because we have the situation under
control," Romanian agriculture minister Gheorghe Flutur told
journalists.
Officials have sealed off the affected area and vaccinated
the population against regular flu to boost their immunity.
Flutur said preventive measures such as checkpoints on roads
to disinfect those who travel out of the area and medical
surveillance of all domestic birds would be taken in 6
counties in the south-eastern Dobrogea region [A territory
between the lower Danube River and the Black Sea, which
includes the Danube Delta and the Romanian seashore. The
Tulcea region is situated in south Dobrogea. - Mod.AS].
Transport of live birds from these counties was forbidden,
and domestic birds must be closed indoors or in yards to
avoid contact with wild birds, Flutur said. He said pigs
must also be isolated because the virus can be passed on to
them.
"We are fighting to prevent an expansion (of outbreaks),
this is why we take measures even in areas where there are
no problems," he said. Fairs selling live birds and pigs
were forbidden across Romania, Flutur added.
Television footage showed masked and gloved veterinarians
gassing poultry, burning their carcasses and disinfecting
farms in the Danube delta village of Ceamurlia de Jos on
Saturday.
Romanian authorities have culled 18 000 domestic birds so
far in the village this week and said 45 000 birds in the
area would have to be killed to prevent the disease from
spreading.
"We are now thoroughly checking the entire village with
veterinarian experts," Ceamurlia de Jos Mayor Mihai
Carciumaru told Reuters. "We are gathering all the faeces
from birds and will burn them. People have all been
vaccinated and we have advised the population to alert us if
they experience any symptoms."
On Friday, officials isolated the bird flu virus in 2 more
birds -- a hen and a swan -- in Maliuc, a village 40 km (25
miles) north of Ceamurlia de Jos where the 1st outbreak
occurred.
Romania's government has asked the Swiss drug company Roche
Holding AG to provide 45 000 doses of the antiviral drug
Tamiflu as a precautionary move to fight a possible spread
to humans.

[An official confirmation -- or otherwise -- of the
detection of a 2nd focus of disease, in Maliuc, is
anticipated. Maliuc commune is situated in the center of
Tulcea County, about 15 km east of the region's capital, the
city of Tulcea. For a map showing Tulcea county within
Romania, see

On 8 Oct 2005 (see 20051010.2950), suspected avian influenza
cases in another village within the Danube delta, Smardan,
situated in the north western part of the Tulcea region,
were mentioned. No further data followed; details on this
suspected case would help. - Mod.AS]
