Hepatitis C cases in region on the rise
---------------------------------------
Federal, state, and local health officials are trying to figure out
why the number of hepatitis C cases in 6 central and northern
Wisconsin counties has increased.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state
Department of Health Services are working with the health departments
in Wood, Portage, Marathon, Langlade, Lincoln, and Oneida counties to
figure out the reason the number of new cases among people younger
than 30 years of age more than doubled in 2009 and 2010, said Joanie
Kuennen, Wood County public health nurse. From 2004 through 2008, the
6-county area had a combined average of 12.2 cases a year. In 2009 and
2010, they averaged 27 cases annually.

Hepatitis C, a viral disease, causes inflammation of the liver, which
can lead to various health problems, including liver cancer and death,
Kuennen said. Unlike with hepatitis A and B, there is no preventive
vaccine.

Health officials are in the middle of an investigation into the
problem, said Melanie Behr, nursing supervisor for Portage County
Community Health. Although it's listed as one of the 6 counties,
Portage County hasn't seen the same increase as the other 5 counties,
she said. However, Behr wants to wait for the results of the
investigation before making any assumptions about the situation.

The state and federal agencies gave the counties a survey to use when
talking with people to determine a commonality for what people were
doing when they were infected with hepatitis C, Kuennen said.

The 6 counties aren't alone in the problem, Kuennen said. "It's
happening nationwide; it's not just Wisconsin, or the northern
region," she said. One of the potential causes for the trend is an
increase in intravenous drug use, Kuennen said. Illegal drugs, such as
heroin, can be purchased for less money than some of the prescription
drugs that get abused, such as oxycodone.

The one new case of hepatitis C seen in Portage County in 2010
involved intravenous drug use, Behr said. Heroin use is becoming more
socially accepted, Wood County investigator-sgt. Scott Saeger said.
Nationally, health department officials think 35 to 70 per cent of
drug users who inject are infected with hepatitis C, Saeger said.

To avoid contracting the disease, people should make sure they use
clean needles every time and never share a needle, Kuennen said.
People can become part of a clean needle exchange program by
contacting their local health department. Kuennen also recommends
people who are getting tattoos or piercings check to make sure the
provider is state certified and inspected.

Tattoo artists need to check their sanitizing equipment monthly and
provide the records to county officials during inspections, said Kate
Carlson, Wood County environmental health specialist. This protects
the health of clients. Kuennen recommends that anyone who has ever
shared a needle get tested for hepatitis C. One of the problems with
the disease is that it usually doesn't have any visible symptoms until
the person who has it becomes very sick.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the commonest chronic bloodborne
infection and it appears to be increasing in parts of the United
States and elsewhere [for instance see the recent ProMED-mil archived
reports: Hepatitis C - Canada: (QC) 20110510.1438, and Hepatitis C -
S. Korea: increase 20110621.1898]. At the moment the factors
responsible for the rise in prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection
in 5 of 6 central Wisconsin counties has yet to be determined.

In the United States about 3.2 million people are chronically
infected. Sixty to 70 per cent of people newly infected with hepatitis
C virus are usually asymptomatic or have a mild clinical illness.
Hepatitis C virus RNA can be detected in blood within 1­3 weeks after
exposure. The average time from exposure to antibody to hepatitis C
virus seroconversion is 8­9 weeks, and anti-HCV can be detected in
over 97 per cent of people by 6 months after exposure.

Chronic HCV infection develops in 70 to ­85 per cent of HCV infected
people; 60 to ­70 per cent of those chronically infected have
evidence of active liver disease. Most of those infected might not be
aware of their infection because they are not clinically ill, but they
may serve as a source of transmission to others and are at risk of
chronic liver disease or other HCV-related chronic diseases decades
after infection.

HCV is most efficiently transmitted through large or repeated
percutaneous exposure to infected blood (for example, through
transfusion of blood from unscreened donors or through use of
injecting drugs). Although much less frequent, occupational,
perinatal, and sexual exposures also can result in transmission of
HCV. The role of sexual activity in the transmission of HCV has been
controversial. Surveillance data indicate that 15 to ­20 per cent of
people reported with acute HCV infection have a history of sexual
exposure in the absence of other risk factors.

15 per cent to 25 per cent of people clear the virus from their
bodies without treatment and do not develop chronic infection, but HCV
infection becomes chronic in about 75 per cent to 85 per cent of
cases. Chronic liver disease in people with HCV infection is usually
insidious, progressing slowly without any signs or symptoms for
several decades and often not recognized until asymptomatic people are
identified as HCV-positive or when elevated alanine aminotransferase
levels are detected during routine examinations.
