Yellow fever in Sudan - update 6 Dec 2012
--------------
As of [4 Dec 2012], a total of 732 suspected cases of yellow fever, including 165 deaths have been reported in 33 out of 64 localities in Darfur. Laboratory results have confirmed yellow fever by IgM ELISA test and PCR in 40 clinical samples. Tests were conducted at the National Public Health Laboratory in Khartoum, with support from the US Naval Medical Unit 3 (NAMRU-3), WHO Collaborating Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases.

Currently, the Federal Ministry of Health is organizing an emergency mass vaccination campaign against yellow fever. The 1st phase of the campaign began on [21 Nov 2012], to cover 2.2 million people, and the 2nd phase of the campaign is planned for this month [December 2012], to cover an additional 1.2 million at risk population.

The vaccination campaign is being supported by the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG*), GAVI Alliance, ECHO, Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), Sudan Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF), and non-governmental organizations working where the campaign is being carried out.

A comprehensive assessment of the outbreak is ongoing, to obtain additional epidemiological, laboratory and entomological information to understand the evolution of the outbreak and the risk of the epidemic.

WHO has activated the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) and is deploying additional experts including an entomologist, virologists and an epidemiologist to support the ongoing response in the country.

* The YF-ICG is a partnership that manages the stockpile of yellow fever vaccines for emergency response on the basis of a rotation fund. It is represented by United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and WHO, which also serves as the Secretariat. The stockpile was created by GAVI Alliance.

A rare outbreak of mosquito-borne yellow fever which has killed 165 people in Sudan's Darfur region in the past 3 months continues to spread, the UN warned on Thursday [6 Dec 2012].

"The outbreak is very significant, and the spread of the disease shows no signs of stopping," the United Nations resident and humanitarian coordinator, Ali al-Za'tari, said in a statement. He said there is an urgent need for more funds for additional vaccines. "The only way to stop its spread is to ensure vaccinations are administered to all people at risk," Za'tari said.

Since 2 Sep [2012], there have been 732 suspected yellow fever cases including 165 deaths, said a separate report from the UN's World Health Organization (WHO) and Sudan's Ministry of Health.

The death toll has now surpassed that of a 2005 yellow fever outbreak in Sudan's South Kordofan state which caused 163 deaths from 604 cases over about 5 months.

"It is likely that many more cases of yellow fever have not been reported to health authorities," the statement from Za'tari's office said.

A vaccination campaign began on 20 Nov [2012] in the 12 most affected areas of Darfur. So far, 1.3 million people have been inoculated, the statement said, adding that health workers have been able to reduce the death rate to about 24 per cent from 40 per cent earlier in the outbreak.

Sudan's impoverished western Darfur region has been plagued by conflict since ethnic minority rebels rose against the Arab-dominated Khartoum government in 2003.

This is the 1st yellow fever outbreak in Darfur in 10 or 20 years, WHO country representative Anshu Banerjee said last month [November 2012].

The yellow fever virus normally circulates among monkeys but could be linked to more mosquitoes breeding this year [2012] after heavy rains and flooding in the region. Mosquitoes can become infected from the primates and transfer the virus to humans, Banerjee said.

There is no specific treatment for the illness, which is found in tropical regions of Africa, but it can be contained through the use of bed nets, insect repellents, and long clothing. Vaccination is the most important preventative measure.

[The statement that the outbreak shows no signs of stopping is of concern. It is good to see that health workers have been able to reduce the case fatality rate significantly. When the vaccination and vector control campaign began, Sudan health authorities indicated that it would last 10-12 days. That time limit has been reached. Apparently, the campaign is continuing. ProMED would be interested in receiving specific information about plans, time lines and locations for continued effort, especially for what health authorities have termed phase 2.
