African Histoplasmosis in HIV-Negative Patients, Kimpese, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Pakasa N, Biber A, Nsiangana S, Imposo D, et al.

Abstract
-----
We describe a case series of histoplasmosis caused by _Histoplasma capsulatum_ var. _duboisii_ during July 2011-January 2014 in Kimpese, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Cases were confirmed by histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and reverse transcription PCR. All patients were HIV negative. Putative sources for the pathogen were cellar bats and guano fertilizer exploitation.

Conclusions
--------
This histology-based study identified a novel focus of _H. duboisii_ in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the city of Kimpese and its vicinity. Over a period of [about] 2 years, 36 cases were routinely detected in a single pathology laboratory in this area; all patients were HIV negative.

The putative source of infection appears to be cellar bats, _Chaerephon pumilus_, and guano fertilizer overexploitation. African histoplasmosis has previously been reported to be isolated from the intestinal contents of bats belonging to the species _Nycteris hispida_ and _Tadarida pumila_ from a cave in rural Nigeria and from soil mixed with bat guano (8).

The subsiding of new cases could be related to the incidental cessation of the use of bat guano along with the reintroduction of chemical fertilizers. This change was unrelated to any knowledge about the infection risk of guano and may be reversed when the guano accumulates again to sizable amounts.

This case series featured a high incidence of infection in women and girls and in young children, including toddlers and school-age children. Six patients were 3-7 years of age, an age when children are more tied to their mothers, sit on the ground, and may be in contact with contaminated soil. Although HIV tests were negative, other innate or acquired immunosuppression was not ruled out.

During the 1st year of our case series, more cases were initially labeled as lymphoproliferative disorders or extrapulmonary tuberculosis, whereas in subsequent years, cases were initially suspected to be histoplasmosis infections. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that, in endemic areas, where histopathological diagnosis or advanced microbiology labs are not widely accessible, the disease may be underdiagnosed; therefore, the prevalence of African histoplasmosis may be underestimated.

The diagnosis of African histoplasmosis is made mainly by histopathology, which shows granulomatous inflammation and giant cells containing numerous large yeast cells 10-15 um in diameter, which are thick-walled and divided by narrow budding. The fungus is easily visible by GMS, Gridley, or PAS staining (4). IHC [immunohistochemistry] staining, which was performed on 12 specimens, is not specific for African histoplasmosis but to _H. capsulatum_; therefore, it may play a role in more accurate and faster diagnosis and enable exclusion of other fungal infections.

In our series, 3 samples were tested by RT-PCR, and results were positive in all 3 for _H. capsulatum_ diagnosis. Newer PCR protocols have been developed and may provide rapid and species-specific diagnosis (9).

Our histopathologic observation has some limitations. IHC and the RT-PCR primers that were used are unable to differentiate between _H. capsulatum_ var. _capsulatum_ and var. _duboisii_, yet they confirmed the histoplasmosis diagnosis, and IHC together with the large size of the yeast make it specific for _H. duboisii_. Soil and the bat guano from the infected areas have not yet been tested for _H. capsulatum_ var. _duboisii_. Among the strengths of this study is that this unusual case series is unique in its extent and clustering of cases. In addition, the available data add novel epidemiologic and diagnostic information to the current knowledge about this neglected disease.

Further investigation should be conducted to understand the reservoir of the pathogen, the types of daily activities that might pose risk factors for acquiring the disease, and the mode of transmission and progression of the disease. Because diagnosis, especially in these rural areas, is challenging, seroepidemiologic surveys are needed to establish the extent of this infection.

[_Histoplasma capsulatum_, a dimorphic fungus, is found worldwide in soil enriched by bird or bat droppings. Contaminated soil can be potentially infectious for years. Fungal spores become airborne during activities that disturb the contaminated soil, such as spelunking, mining, construction, excavation, demolition, roofing, chimney cleaning, farming, or gardening, which can lead to clusters of cases of histoplasmosis that follow inhalation of the aerosolized spores. The spores can travel distances downstream from the source in currents of air.

Birds cannot be infected by the fungus and do not transmit the disease; however, bats can become infected by _H. capsulatum_ and may harbor the fungus in their gut (https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/15/2/133/1801173).

In the U.S., histoplasmosis is endemic in the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi River valleys, where it is caused by _H. capsulatum_ var. _capsulatum_. In Africa, histoplasmosis occurs most commonly in west and central Africa, particularly where it is caused by the _duboisii_ variety, which has yeast cells that average about twice the size of _H. capsulatum_ var. _capsulatum_ (http://www.reviberoammicol.com/1997-14/155159.pdf). _H. capsulatum _ var. _duboisii_, commonly involves the skin, bones and lymph nodes. Disseminated disease is especially more common in HIV/AIDS-associated cases.

The above study involved 36 cases of histoplasmosis identified in tissue specimens (lymph, skin, bone) by a pathology laboratory in the town of Kimpese, DR Congo from 2011 to 2014. The patients were HIV-negative women and children; a few patients who were available for interviews reported living in houses infested with cellar bats; these persons frequently collected guano from cellars to fertilize gardens.

Kimpese, with a population of over 50 000 residents, is a town in the Cataractes District of Kongo Central (formerly Bas-Congo) province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, between Kinshasa and the provincial capital Matadi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimpese). Kimpese has a 400-bed hospital that serves 150 000 people in the local area and a medical training center.
