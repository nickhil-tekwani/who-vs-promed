Between 27 Mar 2022 and 31 Mar 2022, Rethy Health Zone (RHZ), located in the Djugu Territory, Ituri Province, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), reported 16 suspect bubonic plague cases, including 2 deaths (CFR = 12.5%). The cases have been reported by 3 health centers, namely, Rassia (2 cases / 1 death), Lokpa (11 cases / 1 death), and Kpandroma (3 cases / 0 death). On 28 Mar 2022, the central office of the RHZ was alerted by the attending nurse of the Rassia health center on the death of a 30-year-old woman, coming from the village of Lokpa. She was admitted on 26 Mar 2022 with the following complaints: inguinal pain on the right side of the body, chills and fever. Although given gentamicin treatment at the health center, her health condition degraded. A growingly painful swelling in the right inguinal fold accompanied by vomiting, coughing and intense asthenia led to her death on the morning of 28 Mar 2022. Upon arrival at the outbreak site, the health zone team ensured safe burial.

On 30 Mar 2022, the health zone team accompanied by a member of the CSLP (Dr. Pascal Adroba) arrived to support the health zone management team and organized a rapid investigation in Lokpa village, consulting the records of the Lokpa health center. The team traced 9 additional active suspected plague cases, including 3 cases under observation transferred at the Kpandroma health center and 6 cases at the Lokpa health center. During the investigation, residents reported rat die-offs in peridomestic settings since 23 Mar 2022. A family cluster was identified with 3 of 7 people sick in the household and reported the death of 6 guinea pigs [known to be sensitive to plague] between 26-28 Mar 2022. The carcasses of the dead guinea pigs were eaten by crows. Fearing to lose the 4 remaining guinea pigs, the family cooked and ate them. Two bubo aspirates were positive with the RDT provided by Malteser NGO.

On 31 Mar 2022, the Lokpa health center reported 3 more cases and the death of a 5-year-old child with cough and blood-stained sputum, although he had been given gentamicin treatment beginning on 29 Mar 2022. The team proceeded to safe burial of the deceased 5-year-old. Five houses were sprayed with deltametrin to control fleas, and 53 people received either doxycycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis as appropriate.

The epidemiological context (endemic area, rodent die-off), the clinical symptoms consistent with the case definition of suspect plague, and the specific RDT result on bubo aspirates -- while not gold standard for confirmatory diagnostic -- is directing towards plague caused by _Yersinia pestis_. Currently, no official outbreak response has been organized to support the RHZ team, which is suffering from a lack of drug provision (prophylactics and therapeutics), logistical support, and PPE to respond to the outbreak. The risk of pneumonic plague outbreak cannot be ruled out, and there is urgent need for confirmatory diagnostics, including AMR testing due to the apparent lack of improvement after treatment with gentamicin. Despite recurrent alarm calls about the expansion of the Ituri plague focus [https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20201231.8061711], and although shaken by insecurity, control and prevention of plague in eastern DRC need urgent support and research. Only a national "One Health" coordinated response can prevent plague to spread; only confirmatory diagnostics can allow for modelling and weight on funding support; and only molecular and/or culture can help understand the strain profile circulating in the oldest plague focus and the outcome of future outbreaks.

[Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a bubo. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. The bacteremia can also occur as an initial event. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. It is the pneumonic form of infection that can spread by the airborne route. - Mod.LL
