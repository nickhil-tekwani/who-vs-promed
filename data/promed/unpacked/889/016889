[1] South Korea, 12 total cases - media report

South Korea confirmed 5 MERS cases Friday [29 May 2015], bringing the total number of patients infected with the potentially deadly virus to 12, including a man who defied a quarantine protocol and travelled to China, health officials said.

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is considered a deadlier but less infectious cousin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus that appeared in Asia in 2003 and killed hundreds of people, mostly in China.

Symptoms may range from flu-like aches and pains to pneumonia and kidney failure.

The health ministry said the new MERS cases included a 30-year-old nurse from the hospital where the original case was reported and a 56-year-old man who was treated there for other diseases.

A 44-year-old man who left for China on a business trip on Tuesday [26 May 2015], a day after his father was diagnosed with the virus, was confirmed Friday [29 May 2015] to have been infected, it said.

The man ignored a warning from doctors advising against travel and is now at a hospital in China. A list of 45 people, including colleagues and passengers who had sat close to him on the Hong Kong-bound flight, has been drawn up. The man later travelled from Hong Kong to the nearby Chinese city of Huizhou by bus.

Hong Kong's health authorities said they had tracked down and would quarantine 12 people -- 3 Korean, 9 Chinese -- who had close contact with the man on the flight and were still in the city. "They will be sent to our quarantine camp later this evening," the Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection chief Leung Ting-hung told reporters.

Leung added that 2 other passengers on the plane, not part of the group of 12, had shown mild respiratory symptoms and were being examined at a Hong Kong hospital.

South Korea's 2nd largest flag carrier, Asiana Airlines, remains on alert as the man used one of its flights, Yonhap news agency said, adding that 6 crew members had been put in isolation.

Health officials said more than 120 people were being monitored after they were exposed directly or indirectly to the original patient.

More than 20 countries have been affected by the virus, with most cases in Saudi Arabia, where more than 400 have been killed since 2012.

[As mentioned in yesterday's [28 May 2015] post, it appears as though there may be a "superspreader" situation unfolding in South Korea. To date, it appears as though there have been 2 generations of cases, the index case and multiple contacts of this index case in the household and healthcare environment. An obvious concern is whether there will be subsequent generations of spread or whether it will stop with the 2nd generation. We await more detailed epidemiologic information on the locations of contacts etc. of the 12 cases reported thus far.

[2] China ex Korea, confirmed - media report

China said on Friday [29 May 2015] that a South Korean man had tested positive for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), China's 1st confirmed case, but that it had not found any symptoms in the 38 people who had close contact with him.

Health authorities in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong said it was likely the disease would spread, as the patient had taken a bus, crossed a busy border checkpoint, and stayed in a hotel before being taken to hospital.

"As we have said before, the possibility of MERS transferring into Guangdong is very high," He Jianfeng, director for the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control, told reporters. "In theory, it's possible to have a 2nd case." He added, however, that 38 people found to have come into contact with the patient so far hadn't tested positive.

The World Health Organization said on Friday [29 May 2015] that 10 people in South Korea were confirmed as having MERS, but there had been no sustained human-to-human spread. The UN agency said that it was not recommending screening of passengers or that travel or trade restrictions be imposed on South Korea due to the outbreak.

"The virus is not behaving differently. It is direct transmission and not sustained human-to-human-transmission. They are all related to the same case who came travelling from the Middle East," WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told a briefing in Geneva.

The patient, in isolation in hospital in the southern Chinese city of Huizhou, had a fever, and a chest examination showed possible pneumonia, China's National Health and Family Planning Commission said.

"We understand he is currently in a stable condition and is being well cared for," the WHO China office said in a statement.

The 44-year-old man, who is a son of another patient who was confirmed last week to have been infected in South Korea, had travelled to Huizhou after 1st arriving in Hong Kong on Tuesday [26 May 2015], according to South Korean and Chinese authorities.

Two new victims in South Korea are believed to have caught the virus from the 1st case confirmed last week, a 68-year-old man who had travelled to Bahrain in April and May [2015] and returned to South Korea via Qatar [his itinerary also included a visit to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, see prior ProMED posts MERS-CoV (47): South Korea, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, WHO 20150526.3383778, MERS-CoV (45): Saudi Arabia, South Korea, RFI 20150522.3378310 and MERS-CoV (44): S Korea ex Middle East, Saudi Arabia, UAE, WHO, RFI 20150520.3374579 for more details on the patient's itinerary. - Mod.MPP]

1st identified in humans in 2012, MERS is caused by a coronavirus from the same family as the one that triggered China's deadly 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome. There is no cure or vaccine.

Last week, South Korea's Health Ministry said there were 1142 cases of MERS in 23 countries, and 465 deaths had been reported by [16 May 2015].

[As a historical reminder, the original outbreak of SARS began in Guangdong province. Presumably, the health sector there is attuned to the ways to interrupt transmission of the MERS-CoV. Hopefully, there will not be a 3rd generation spread involving this individual's travel within the province.

A HealthMap/ProMED map of China can be found at: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3395374,155. Guangdong is located in the south of the country and is contiguous with Hong Kong. It can be found at http://www.maps-of-china.net/province_map.html. - Mod.MPP]

[The number of cases reported from Hufoof (Hufof, Hafoof) continues to grow, now at 14 since 20 Apr 2015. It would be interesting to learn whether the contact with other case(s) is occurring in the households or in the healthcare environment... Is this a mixed nosocomial and community based outbreak?

It is interesting that all 3 cases reported today [29 May 2015] have a history of contact with other known cases. A map showing the locations of the reported cases today can be found at the source URL. - Mod.MPP
