Laboratory-confirmed case of measles in a returned traveller from the
FIFA World Cup in South Africa
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A 24-year-old male travelled from Australia to South Africa. He did
not seek pre-travel medical advice, but had been immunised as a
child. He attended the following world cup matches:

England vs USA - Rustenberg 12 Jun 2010
Australia vs Germany - Durban 13 Jun 2010
England vs Algeria - Cape Town 18 Jun 2010
Australia vs Ghana - Rustenberg 19 Jun 2010
Australia vs Serbia - Nelspruit 23 Jun 2010

The patient did not fly during the period of communicability. He did
however attend 2 family practitioner offices and a cinema in Darwin,
Australia when infectious to others. He had a clinical presentation
of fever, macular/confluent rash, prominent respiratory symptoms,
conjunctivitis, and Koplick's spots. Nose and throat swabs were
positive for measles virus RNA. He is expected to make a complete
recovery.

Given that the patient's symptoms first appeared on Fri 2 Jul 2010
and the rash appeared on Sun 4 Jul 2010, it could be speculated that
he became infected in either Cape Town or Rustenberg. Transmission of
measles within domed [roofed] sporting arenas has been described
previously (1).

Given the large current outbreak of measles in South Africa (2),
clinicians and public health officers should be alert to possible
presentations of measles in returned travellers from the FIFA
[Federation Internationale de Football Association] World Cup.
Additional transmission may also have occurred in Darwin, Australia
in late June/early July 2010. Young adults, such as this case, are at
risk of measles infection as they may have only had one immunisation
and consequently may have had insufficient protection.

[According to the WHO Measles fact sheet
(<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs286/en/index.html>) the
1st sign of measles is usually a high fever, which begins about 10 to
12 days after exposure to the virus, and lasts 4 to 7 days. A runny
nose, a cough, red and watery eyes, and small white spots inside the
cheeks can develop in the initial stage. After several days, a rash
erupts, usually on the face and upper neck. Over about 3 days, the
rash spreads, eventually reaching the hands and feet. The rash lasts
for 5 to 6 days, and then fades. On average, the rash occurs 14 days
after exposure to the virus (within a range of 7 to 18 days). It can
be transmitted by an infected person from 4 days prior to the onset
of the rash to 4 days after the rash erupts. The virus remains active
and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces for up to 2 hours.

As of 28 Apr 2010, 12 227 cases of measles had been confirmed in an
outbreak that started in South Africa in January 2009. Cases have
been reported from all 9 provinces of South Africa, but the outbreak
has been concentrated in the northeast of the country. A national
programme to immunise children against measles took place between 12
and 23 Apr 2010.

Travellers to South Africa to attend the FIFA World Cup were
officially advised by the UK Health Protection Agency to ensure that
they were up to date with the British Schedule of vaccination, which
includes measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR)
<https://www.nathnac.org/pro/clinical_updates/2010worldcup_150210.htm>.
The case described above justifies the appropriateness of this travel
advice.
