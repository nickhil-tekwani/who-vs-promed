Dengue/DHF - Cuba: doctor sentenced 971125175143

From: John Woodall <WOODALL@SERVER.BIOQMED.UFRJ.BR>

ProMED-mail has been advised that a colleague is in imminent danger of
prosecution for divulging details of an epidemic in the interest of world
public health.
This reminds us that it is almost one year since Dr. Desi Mendoza Rivero
was detained for alleging that the Cuban authorities were covering up the
true extent of a dengue fever epidemic. Amnesty International said of his
case, "Expressing views which are at odds with official positions is no
reason to be taken to court."
Forty-three-year-old Dr. Mendoza has been in detention since his arrest on
25 June 1997, and last November he was sentenced to 8 years in prison.
Representations asking for his release from Amnesty International,
Physicians for Human Rights, and the Pope himself have been unavailing.
It is notable that countries are becoming more open about reporting
outbreaks, in the interest of global public health. China reported all
human cases of the 'chicken flu,' influenza A H5N1, without delay.
Thailand is now admitting, after years of denial, that they have cholera.
Nowhere, with the single exception of Cuba, have we heard of anyone being
imprisoned for carrying out their duty as a physician to report publicly
matters affecting the public health.
It should be a cause for serious concern, and for strong representations by
public health representatives and governments worldwide, if anyone else
were to be prosecuted for reporting publicly on current public health
emergencies. There is no room for official secrets when it comes to
matters of life and death in the health arena.
