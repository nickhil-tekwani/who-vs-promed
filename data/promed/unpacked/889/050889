Montana livestock officials said Tuesday [13 Sep 2011] that a Park
County cattle herd has been quarantined after 6 of the animals tested
positive for the disease brucellosis.

Additional testing on the animals was under way to confirm the
disease, said state veterinarian Marty Zaluski. If confirmed, it would
be the region's 15th infection in livestock since 2004.

Introduced by early European settlers and once widespread, brucellosis
has since been largely eradicated from cattle nationwide after a
decades-long government effort. It persists in parts of Texas and in
wildlife in and around Yellowstone National Park.

Brucellosis can cause pregnant animals to miscarry and has been blamed
for weight loss and other problems in cattle. It is not considered a
significant threat to human health.

Errol Rice with the Montana Stockgrowers Association said the
suspected infection in the 150-head herd demonstrated that more needs
to be done to eliminate the disease. "The more cases we continue to
identify, it makes you wonder have we really made that much progress
on mitigating the problem," Rice said. "The fact remains we still have
a large reservoir of the disease in a particular area of Montana that
continues to affect our industry."

Thousands of Yellowstone bison have been captured and sent to
slaughter over the last decade to prevent transmissions to cattle when
the bison migrate to lower elevations in Montana. That has not stopped
transmissions from the tens of thousands of elk that roam freely
across the Yellowstone region.

Tests on elk over the last year revealed a new area of wildlife
infections in parts of Montana west of Yellowstone. Montana, Idaho,
and Wyoming in recent years started requiring more stringent testing
and vaccinations against the disease. That prompted the federal
government to stop automatically imposing trade restrictions on states
that have multiple infections.

The government also no longer requires that infected herds be
slaughtered. State officials did not disclose the name of the ranch
where the disease was found. The Park County infections, if confirmed,
would mark Montana's 4th case in recent years, including 1 in November
[2010] on a bison ranch owned by media mogul and philanthropist Ted
Turner.

Turner's bison remain under quarantine, although testing is under way
to lift restrictions on the animals, state officials said. Wyoming had
2 outbreaks last year [2010] and 1 in February [2011]. Idaho's last
outbreak was in 2009.

Park County and the Park County Stockgrowers Association each have
lawsuits pending over the management of Yellowstone's bison by the
state and federal governments. A hearing in those cases was scheduled
next month [October 2011] in Lewistown.

[The Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) remains one of the areas where
brucellosis spills over into the domestic population. Perhaps some
times it spills into the wildlife, but that may be speculation.

Texas may take exception to this article, as there are likely other
areas that may have a last nidus of the infection. If a producer has
not sold an animal from a particular premise in a long time, then the
disease may not have been found. This is what happened in Texas, and
could just as well happen in other places.

However, this is likely a case related in some way to the GYA.
