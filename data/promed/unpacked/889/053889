The head of the Division of Zoonotic Diseases of the Virgen de Chaguaya Hospital in Bermejo, Tarija, Carlos Angulo, stated that to date [7 Jul 2022] 4 hantavirus [infection] cases have been reported and the regional health system has issued an alert.

Quoted by Urgente.bo, he mentioned, that the main symptom is respiratory failure and can be confused with COVID-19 because it mainly attacks the lungs.

He also said that the [hantavirus] endemic areas are the Gran Chaco and Arce provinces.

"You have to be careful about coming into contact with rodents or with their urine and waste that may have the virus," said the medical professional.

[Cases of hantavirus infections in Tarija department are not new. Tarija department is endemic for hantaviruses, and cases occur there sporadically. In 2018, there were 11 cases. The previously reported 2015 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) that occurred in Tarija department were confirmed. As noted in the previous comments, earlier cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been reported from tropical, lowland areas of Bolivia, including 7 cases in Tarija during 2014. The specific hantaviruses involved in these or previous cases in Bolivia were not given.

In the lowland Amazon Basin of Bolivia, the rodent hosts of the hantavirus that might be involved in these hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases, with their images, include the following:
- Laguna Negra virus (small vesper mouse, _Calomys laucha_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/calomyslaucha.html and large vesper mouse, _C. callosus_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/calomyscallosus.html);
- Bermejo (Chaco rice rat, _Oligoryzomys chacoensis_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/oligorizomyschacoensis.html); and
- Oran (long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _O. longicaudatus_ http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1203.jpeg).

Since previous cases in Tarija department have occurred in Bermejo, perhaps Bermejo hantavirus was involved.

Dr Jan Clement commented earlier that there is a need to be able to differentiate Seoul orthohantavirus (SEOV) as a causative agent, but that is hampered by the fact that most current commercial ELISA or WB formats no longer contain a SEOV antigen, so that a preliminary presumption of a hantavirus infection can even be missed in non-research laboratories (https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/222/8/1311/5850525), and: Reynes JM, Carli D, Bour JB et al. Seoul virus infection in humans, France, 2014-2016. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(6): 973-7; https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/6/16-0927_article.

SEOV is widely distributed around the world in the brown rat and is likely found in Tarija department. - Mod.TY
