The Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is investigating an incident of suspected ciguatoxin poisoning affecting 19 people who consumed a coral reef fish, according to a press release issued on Monday [10 Jun 2013].

According to health officials, the outbreak involved 14 men and 5 women, aged between 23 and 71 years, who developed symptoms of ciguatoxin poisoning including limb numbness and weakness, abdominal pain, perioral parasthesia [tingling around the mouth], skin itchiness, palpitation, diarrhea, and vomiting about 3 to 19 hours after eating a fish during lunch in a restaurant on Lamma Island on 8 Jun 2013. The South China Morning Post has identified the restaurant as the Wai Kee Sea Food Restaurant in Sok Kwu Wan.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ciguatera fish poisoning (or ciguatera) is an illness caused by eating fish (barracuda, black grouper, blackfin snapper, cubera snapper, dog snapper, greater amberjack, hogfish, horse-eye jack, king mackerel, and yellowfin grouper, among others) that contain toxins produced by a marine microalga called _Gambierdiscus toxicus_.

People who have ciguatera may experience nausea, vomiting, and neurologic symptoms such as tingling fingers or toes. They also may find that cold things feel hot and hot things feel cold. Ciguatera has no cure. Symptoms usually go away in days or weeks, but can last for years. People who have ciguatera can be treated for their symptoms.

According to a CHP spokesman, "The toxin cannot be destroyed by cooking" and "it is not easy to tell from the appearance of the fish whether it contains the toxin".

The CHP offers the following advice to avoid ciguatera food poisoning:
- eat less coral reef fish;
- eat small amounts of coral reef fish at any one meal and avoid having a whole fish feast in which all the dishes come from the same big coral reef fish;
- avoid eating the head, skin, intestines and roe of coral reef fish, which usually have a higher concentration of toxins;
- when eating coral reef fish, avoid consuming alcohol, peanuts or beans, as they may aggravate ciguatoxin poisoning;
- seek medical treatment immediately should symptoms of ciguatoxin fish poisoning appear; and
- coral reef fish should be purchased from reputable and licensed seafood shops. Do not buy the fish when the source is doubtful.

The following is taken from CDC: Cluster of ciguatera fish poisoning -- North Carolina, 2007. MMWR 2009; 58: 283-5
(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5811a3.htm; edited; original citation numbering retained):

"Ciguatoxins are lipid-soluble cyclic polyether compounds and are the most potent sodium channel toxins known (3). Carnivorous tropical and semitropical fish, such as barracuda, amberjack, red snapper, and grouper, become contaminated with ciguatoxins by feeding on plant-eating fish that have ingested _Gambierdiscus toxicus_ or another member of the _Gambierdiscus_ genus, a group of large dinoflagellates commonly found in coral reef waters (4). Gambiertoxins from _Gambierdiscus_ spp. are converted into more potent lipid-soluble ciguatoxins. Spoilage of fish that have been caught is not a factor in toxin development, and cooking does not deactivate the toxin. Humans who eat contaminated predatory fish are exposed to variable concentrations of ciguatoxin, depending on the fish size, age, and part consumed (toxins concentrate more in the viscera, especially liver, spleen, gonads, and roe). The attack rate can be as high as 80 to 90 per cent in persons who eat affected fish, depending on the amount of toxin in the fish.

"Persistence or recurrence of neurologic symptoms are hallmarks of CFP [ciguatera fish poisoning]. 3 of the 9 patients in this cluster had recurrences of one or more symptoms for more than 6 months after their initial illness. If these patients are again exposed to fish (either ciguatoxin-contaminated or even noncontaminated fish), their symptoms likely will be more severe than those experienced with their initial episodes of CFP (3).

"Variations in the geographic distribution of the various ciguatoxins might explain regional differences in symptom patterns. CFP symptoms associated with eating fish from the Pacific Ocean are primarily neurologic, and symptoms associated with eating fish from the Caribbean Sea are more commonly gastrointestinal (4). Amberjack often is linked to CFP cases in the Caribbean. Although the amberjack fish responsible for this cluster of CFP cases tested positive for C-CTX-1, it was not tested for the presence of other ciguatoxins, which also might have been present and could have altered disease presentation (7).

"CFP has been associated almost exclusively with eating fish caught in tropical or semitropical waters, but increased global marketing of these species has increased the possibility that persons in temperate zones might become ill with CFP (4). Moreover, warming seawaters might expand the ranges of ciguatoxin-contaminated fish (8). In the USA, such fish have been found as far north as the coastal waters of North Carolina. Despite underreporting, CFP now is considered one of the most common illnesses related to fish consumption in the USA (9).

"Any level of Caribbean ciguatoxin 0.1 ppb [parts per billion] or more of fish tissue is thought to pose a health risk (3). As this illness becomes more common in nontropical areas of the world, clinicians need to be aware of its manifestations and how to manage it. Although opinions vary on the most effective course of treatment, intravenous mannitol has been a mainstay of management of neurologic symptoms for more than 20 years. Early mannitol treatment is considered more effective, but anecdotal evidence suggests that even delayed therapy benefits some patients. Amitriptyline also has been useful in relieving some of the neurologic symptoms of CFP (10). If evaluating a possible case, clinicians should consult their local poison control center for the latest treatment guidelines.
