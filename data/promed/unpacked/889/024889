In England, 4 more people have been diagnosed with monkeypox. The United Kingdom Health Security Agency says the risk to the public remains very low, although it appears the individuals caught it in the UK. Monkeypox is usually associated with travel to West Africa.

The new cases -- 3 in London and one in north-east England -- do not have any known links with 2 other cases confirmed on 14 May [2022] or another case announced on 7 May [2022]. The UKHSA says investigations are under way to establish links between the latest 4 cases, who all appear to have been infected in London. Currently, common contacts have been identified for 2 of the 4 latest cases. All 4 self-identify as gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men.

The UKHSA says anyone with concerns that they could be infected should see a health professional, but make contact with the clinic or surgery ahead of a visit.

If you get infected with monkeypox, it usually takes between 5 and 21 days for the 1st symptoms to appear. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body. The rash changes and goes through different stages -- a bit like chicken pox -- before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.

Monkeypox does not spread easily between people. But it can be spread through
- touching clothing, bedding, or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash;
- touching monkeypox skin blisters or scabs;
- the coughs or sneezes of a person with the monkeypox rash.

UKHSA chief medical adviser Dr Susan Hopkins said: "This is rare and unusual. UKHSA is rapidly investigating the source of these infections, because the evidence suggests that there may be transmission of the monkeypox virus in the community, spread by close contact. We are particularly urging men who are gay and bisexual to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service without delay. We are contacting any potential close contacts of the cases to provide health information and advice."

Those patients needing medical care are all in specialist infectious disease units at the Royal Free Hospital, Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne and Guys' and St Thomas'.

Sexual health clinics have reintroduced social distancing amid fears about a spate of monkeypox cases in the UK. At least one practice in West London had already brought in stricter infection control measures yesterday [16 May 2022], before the total number of British cases rose to 7.

Patients were told to keep a one-metre distance in the waiting room and were asked if they had any unusual bumps or rashes prior to each appointment.

Monkeypox can be mistaken for syphilis or other common rash illnesses, making it difficult to diagnose early.

A health source told MailOnline the stricter measures were not part of new national guidance, but they could not rule out some NHS boards 'putting in measures locally'.

UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) bosses have now written to regional NHS teams, telling them to stock up on PPE and be on alert for patients with a new rash.

There are 7 Britons who have been diagnosed with monkeypox, and 6 of them appear to have contracted it in the UK, in a sign the virus is spreading in the community. Of these, 5 are in London, one in the South East, and one in the North East. Of the cases, 4 are in gay or bisexual men.

The 1st UK patient, who was diagnosed nearly 2 weeks ago, had brought the virus back from Nigeria, where the disease is endemic. Transmission between people is 'unusual' and 'surprising', according to experts, but any outbreak is likely to be small.

Dr Michael Head, a public health expert from the University of Southampton, said: 'There's currently gaps in our knowledge, and the contact tracing and public health investigation being carried out by UKHSA will no doubt reveal more in due course, for example, about pattern of transmission. However, it would be very unusual to see anything more than a handful of cases in any outbreak, and we won't be seeing COVID-style levels of transmission.'

At least 3 patients are receiving care at specialist NHS units in London and Newcastle. Officials stress that the virus rarely spreads between humans, but when it does, it is through very close contact.

Monkeypox is not known to be a sexually transmitted disease. It can kill up to 10% of people who get it. Gay and bisexual men, in particular, are being urged to look out for unusual symptoms. But all 7 UK cases have the West African form of it, which is less deadly, killing about one in 100 people. The virus can be mistaken for more common illnesses such as chickenpox, measles, syphilis, and scabies, so [it is not] always identified early.

Experts admitted the recent spate of cases was 'unprecedented' in the UK but insisted the virus will not take off like COVID. Dr Herd added: 'Whilst part of a different family of viruses, a pragmatic comparison might be to suggest that this virus behaves in a similar fashion to Lassa Fever, where we saw a few cases here in the UK earlier in 2022, tragically with an associated death; however, the outbreak did not spread more widely. Here, the risks to the wider UK public are extremely low, and we do have healthcare facilities that specialise in treating these tropical infections.'

What is the monkeypox virus and what are the risks and symptoms?
-------------------------------------------------------------
Monkeypox -- often caught through handling monkeys [wild rodents, not monkeys, are thought to be the reservoirs of the virus. - Mod.TY] -- is a rare viral disease that kills around 10% of people it strikes, according to figures. The virus responsible for the disease is found mainly in the tropical areas of west and central Africa.

Monkeypox was first discovered in 1958, with the 1st reported human case in the Democratic Republic of Congo [then called Zaire] in 1970. Human cases were recorded for the first time in the US in 2003 and the UK in September 2018.

The virus resides in wild animals, but humans can catch it through direct contact with animals, such as handling monkeys [more likely rodents - Mod.TY] or eating inadequately cooked meat. The virus can enter the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract, or the eyes, nose, or mouth. The virus is transmitted via respiratory droplets during prolonged face-to-face contact or bodily fluids.

Symptoms usually appear within 5 and 21 days of infection. These include a fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills, and fatigue. The most obvious symptom is a rash, which usually appears on the face before spreading to other parts of the body. This then forms skin lesions that scab and fall off.

Monkeypox is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a few weeks without treatment. Yet, the disease can often prove fatal.

There are no specific treatments or vaccines available for monkeypox infection, according to the World Health Organization.

[The latest 4 cases are unusual for monkeypox virus infections in that they occurred among men who have sex with men. These 4 cases are the 1st instances where sexual transmission may have occurred. The previously documented rare instances of transmission person to person happened between individuals in close physical contact. It will be interesting to see if additional cases surface in England in the near future.

A vaccine that is expected to be effective against MPX has been developed recently. Bavarian Nordic A/S (OMX: BAVA) announced on 11 Jun 2021 that the company was recently engaged by Public Health England (PHE) and the Medicines and Health Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to supply its IMVANEX smallpox vaccine in response to new cases of monkeypox in the UK. Even if a vaccine were available for use in Africa, deciding where to mount a campaign in this broad geographic area where the virus occurs would be a challenge. - Mod.TY
