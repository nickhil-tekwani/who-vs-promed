Avian flu grows more virulent
-----------------------------
The bird flu virus is mutating and becoming more dangerous to mammals, say
researchers. The discovery reinforces fears that a human pandemic of the
disease could yet occur. Avian flu hit the headlines in 1997 when a strain
called H5N1 jumped from chickens to people, killing 6 people in Hong Kong.
Within 3 days, the country's entire chicken population was slaughtered and
the outbreak was controlled.
Since then new strains of virus have emerged, killing a further 14 people.
As yet, no strain has been able to jump routinely from person to person.
But if a more virulent strain evolves, the fear is that it could trigger
widespread outbreaks, potentially affecting millions of people.
Now, genetic and animal studies show that the virus is becoming more
menacing to mammals. Immediate action is needed to stem the virus's
transmission, says Hualan Chen from Harbin Veterinary Research Institute,
China, who was involved in the research.
Chen and colleagues studied 21 H5N1 flu virus samples taken from apparently
healthy ducks, which act as a natural reservoir for the disease, in
southern China between 1999 and 2002. The researchers inoculated groups of
chickens, mice and ducks with virus samples taken from different years and
waited to see which animals became ill. Their results are presented this
week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. [not yet on
website <http://www.pnas.org/> that I can find. - Mod.SH].
As expected, ducks were immune to the virus's effects and the chickens fell
sick. However, the mice also became ill, losing weight and the use of their
limbs. Crucially, the severity of their illness was linked with the year
from which the virus sample was taken. Viruses isolated in 2001 and 2002
made the animals more ill than those isolated earlier on. The findings hint
that some time around 2001, the virus became adept at infecting mammals.
Genetic analysis of the same samples reveals that the virus's DNA changed
over that time, suggesting that accumulated mutations may have contributed
to the increased virulence.
Researchers are concerned that a virus that has acquired the ability to
infect mice could also infect humans. "The disease could resurge [sic] at
any time," warns virologist Marion Koopmans from the National Institute of
Public Health and the Environment in Bilthoven, the Netherlands. The
findings highlight the need for improved surveillance to ensure that any
future outbreaks are curtailed, she says. Although domestic poultry are
easily culled, wild animals are more difficult to contain. "It is
impossible to eradicate the natural reservoir," says Koopmans, "so we need
to learn to live with it."
Birds may not be the only villains in this story, however. Chen believes
that pigs may also play a part. In Asia, chickens and pigs are often kept
in close proximity, so the virus may have shuffled back and forth between
the 2 species, picking up mutations and becoming better at infecting
mammalian hosts. Humans may then have caught the disease from swine.

[It is difficult to evaluate these experiments. There is no doubt a
potential reservoir of genetic variation in wild water fowl that could
abruptly -- by genetic interaction (reassortment of genome subunits of
avian and mammalian viruses during co-infection of a common host), or
gradually by progressive mutation -- generate a new human pandemic strain
expressing novel antigens to which the human population has no prior
immunity. That this has not happened in recent years indicates that the
evolution of a pandemic virus is a complex and relatively infrequent
phenomenon.
The experiments of Chen and colleagues show that a temporal series of
isolates of H5N1 virus from ducks exhibited increasing virulence when
inoculated into mice. Why this phenomenon is temporally related is unclear.
These observations conflict with the results of previous phylogenetic
analysis, which indicated that avian influenza viruses from wild fowl have
not evolved much over the past 60 years in contrast to mammalian viruses,
and as a consequence it has been concluded that influenza viruses in wild
birds appear to be in "evolutionary stasis". Furthermore, these experiments
with mice may not have direct relevance to the evolution of human pathogens
transmitted by the respiratory route. - Mod.CP]
