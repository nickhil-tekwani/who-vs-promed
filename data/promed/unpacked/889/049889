Yesterday [11 Jan 2012], the cities of La Paz and Trinidad reported the 1st cases of canine rabies (one case in each city) this year [2012]. But some 20 people received preventive treatment [post-exposure] to avoid development of the virus [disease], it was announced yesterday. The head of Zoonoses of the La Paz municipality, Hector Mencias, explained that the 1st case of canine rabies was reported in a puppy in the Alto Vino Tinto area on the east side.

"These are pets that were submitted by the Qanasa non-governmental organization [NGO]. They brought in the puppies, one of which was positive [for rabies], and another is under observation," he said. He stated that the members of 3 families are receiving [anti-rabies] treatment and in one day 400 dogs were vaccinated. This work day, the affected area will continue to be combed. The head of the NGO, Justina Poma, stated that the organization does not give out dogs with rabies, since the animals, before they are adopted, receive vaccine and are healthy.

In Trinidad, the head of Zoonoses of the Beni department [state or province equivalent] Health Service, Daniel Chavez, stated that a canine rabies case occurred and that 13 people received treatment. "There are 13 people affected, of whom 5 were bitten and 8 were in direct contact with the animal. All receive the respective human anti-rabies vaccine -- 7 daily consecutive doses and 3 booster doses every 10 days," he indicated.

[Bolivia continues to have problems with canine rabies. The last outbreak was in Oruro department last month with canine and human case in late December 2011 and before that there were cases in Cochabamba department in October 2011. Because La Paz and Trinidad cities are far apart, these 2 cases surely are unrelated to each other.

One wonders which human vaccine is being used for post-exposure treatment mentioned above. The WHO currently recommends application of cell culture origin vaccines in 4 doses. Might the vaccines being used in Bolivia be of suckling mouse brain origin? Also, no mention is made of administration of human immune globulin in those cases where dog bites occurred.
