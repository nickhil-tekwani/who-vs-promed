MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE - ENGLAND & WALES (OUTBREAK REPORT & 5-YR SUMMARY)
========================================================================

Disease Surveillance Centre, London, UK]:
Communicable Disease Report, CDR Weekly 1996 6 (3):17 (19 January 1996)

Meningococcal disease in England and Wales
Outbreak due to Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C 2b
-----------------------------------------------------
Eight cases of meningococcal disease aged 1 to 17 years, one of whom died,
were reported between 8 December 1995 and 12 January 1996 in adjoining areas
of Rotherham and Nottinghamshire health districts. Seven cases were due to
serogroup C strains, five of which were identified as strain 2b. The eighth
case was a household contact of a case of strain 2b. Six of the cases were
children of school age and some attended the same school. Four of the cases
(who attended different schools) became ill during the first week of January
and could not have acquired their infection during the school term. These
observations indicate that this is a local community outbreak.
There are about 15 000 children aged less than 18 years in the area affected
by the outbreak. The incidence of meningococcal serogroup C in this age
group from 8 December 1995 to 12 January 1996 was, therefore, about 47 per
100 000 population. This can be extrapolated to give an annual incidence of
477 per 100 000, compared with an annual incidence of 2.36 per 100 000
throughout England and Wales in the age group 0 to 19 years (calculated from
the 306 isolates of serogroup C from this age group received by the PHLS
Meningococcal Reference Unit (MRU) in 1995). Meningococcal vaccine (group A
and C) and an antibiotic (rifampicin or ciprofloxacin) were offered to
children aged 2 to 18 years who were resident in or attended nurseries,
playgroups, or schools in the area of the outbreak.

Meningococcal disease 1990 to 1995
----------------------------------
A total of 1361 isolates of N. meningitidis (provisional total) were
received by MRU in 1995 (table a). The final confirmed laboratory total for
1995 will be higher, because case ascertainment is improving with the use of
non-culture methods of diagnosis. Almost a third of isolates received in
1995 were serogroup C, the highest proportion since 1990. A total of 1827
cases of meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia were notified to the
Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) in 1995, higher than in
previous years (table b). The crude case fatality rate in 1995 was 10.1%,
lower than in previous years. The administration of benzylpenicillin before
admission to hospital reduces the case fatality rate and may also reduce the
proportion of cases from whom meningococci are isolated.
