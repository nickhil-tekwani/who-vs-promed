A 13-year-old Kazakh boy died of a strain of plague after being bitten by a
flea in the southern Kyzyl-Orda region, [Kazakhstan an official said on
Monday, the first known death from the plague in the Central Asian state
this year.
"A boy died in the village of Bokaisai after falling ill from septic
bubonic plague, which strikes people down with lightning speed," said Damir
Dauletbayev, head of public health in the Kyzyl-Orda region.
In a telephone interview he said 20 people who had come into contact with
the boy had been isolated, and 2.5 million tenge ($19 000) in state funds
had been made available to contain the disease following the incident.
He gave no further details of the death, but Russian news agencies reported
the boy died on Sunday in the hospital having fallen ill on Friday.
Plague is not directly infectious from man to man but is transmitted by
flea's which carry the disease-causing organism, _Yersinia pestis_ .
A handful of cases of plague have already been reported in the vast former
Soviet republic of 15 million.
Two other people infected in the impoverished Kyzyl-Orda region recovered,
Dauletbayev said. Three more people were in the hospital last week with the
illness in the western region of Mangistau after cutting up a camel carcass.
The outbreaks have coincided with infestations of fleas in some areas,
which some health officials blame on cuts in health and sanitation spending.
Shrinking government spending on health services and increasing poverty
have cut Kazakh's life expectancy, and diseases like tuberculosis,
meningitis and diphtheria have made a comeback in central Asia.
