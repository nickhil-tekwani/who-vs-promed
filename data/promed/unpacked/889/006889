The wildfires that have laid waste to vast parts of California are presenting residents with a new danger: air so thick with smoke it ranks among the dirtiest in the world. In the communities closest to the Paradise fire, a smoky fog cloaked the roads, evacuees wandered in white masks and officials said respiratory hospitalizations had surged. Nearly 200 miles [about 320 km] to the south, in San Francisco, the smoke was so thick health warnings prompted widespread school closings. Even the city's cable cars were not operating. [Likely due to health concerns of the operators. - Mod.TG]

Wood smoke contains some toxic properties. While humans have long been around fire, they generally inhale it in small doses over cooking or heat fires. Humans have not, however, evolved to handle prolonged inhalation of caustic air [from burning homes, plastic and insulation contents, etc. - Mod.TG] from something like the Paradise blaze, Dr Balmes said.

Research into the long term health effects of large wildfires is still new. But a growing body of science shows how inhalation of minuscule particles from wood fires can nestle in the folds of lung tissue and do harm to the human immune system. [The key issue here is long term exposure without the ability to get away from it. - Mod.TG]

The body responses to what it sees as an alien presence, and those effects can last for years by priming the body to overreact when it encounters subsequent lung irritation, said Dr Kari Nadeau, a pediatric allergy and asthma specialist at Stanford.

Officials statewide don't have a grasp yet of how damaging and widespread the health effects of the smoke might be.

The 142 000 acre [about 57 500 ha] fire was 45 per cent contained, and officials said they expected to reach 100 per cent by 30 Nov 2018. Full containment does not mean the fire is extinguished, only that firefighters were able to complete a perimeter around the flames and stop them from spreading.

An extensive study of the 2015 wildfire season in Northern California found smoke exposure led to increased emergency room visits for adults of all ages, but particularly those over 65 years old. One of the biggest research projects on the subject looked at nearly 1.2 million emergency room visits during the summer of 2015, and found during smoke-dense periods, there was a statistically significant increase in emergency room visits for heart attack, stroke and respiratory infection.

For anyone who must go outside, the state public health department recommends P100 masks and N95 respirators, both of which are approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for use by firefighters.

In the communities around Paradise, air quality is considered hazardous for everyone [including fire fighters. - Mod.TG] and the county health department is urging people to remain inside. But this has been difficult for evacuees. More than 81 000 people have been forced from their homes and many are sleeping outside in tents, unable to find other shelter.

This week [week of 12 Nov 2018], some around Paradise said when they inhaled, they could feel the particles cutting their throats. Others likened breathing to a persistent low-level anxiety attack. "Let me put it this way," said BD, 66, who already has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, "you almost feel like you're choking."

The precise biological mechanics of how people develop chronic lung problems, is not fully flushed out.

Immune cells responding to foreign particles by attacking the offending particles, to destroy the offending particles. But an intense event like extremely poor air quality can prompt such a strong immune response it can throw the body's delicate network out of balance, particularly in people predisposed to asthma or allergy.

A vicious cycle can begin where each time a person experiences even small, related stress -- like smoke -- the body overreacts, leading to constricted air flow and intensifying the risk of heart attack and stroke for some people.

Researchers say ill health occurs through wildfire, but also through prolonged pollen seasons, dust storms, and other events affecting air quality.

[These fires are terrible. It is not the same as a pleasant camp fire. Homes contain plastics, chemicals, synthetic materials, and many other components which, when burnt, create smoke full of toxic particles. These particles may affect the lungs, much like the tar and nicotine of cigarette smoke lodging in the lungs of smokers. Those already suffering from heart or lung conditions, such as asthma, may find this to be particularly difficult. Those who are escaping the fires and are unfortunately unable to find indoor shelter and have prolonged exposure to the thick smoke are likely to be sensitized to some particles in the air.

This continued inhalation of so much smoke may cause some individuals to become more sensitive to some particles, such as influenza viruses or cold viruses or be set up for allergic conditions. While there are many conversations to be had regarding this situation and we feel most sympathetic for these individuals, it would be best if those affected discussed their health situation with their physician or a specialist their physician may refer them too. ProMED-mail is not a health chatline, nor do we offer advice in this situation. - Mod.TG
