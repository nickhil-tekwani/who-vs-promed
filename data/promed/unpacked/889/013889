Croatia tests dead birds as bird flu fears rise
-----------------------------------------------
Croatia has started testing dead birds found by citizens for possible avian
flu, a sign of growing concern in the former Yugoslav republic, where no
cases of the disease have been reported so far.
"Until recently, people simply did not notice dead birds, but now they see
them everywhere and immediately call the police," an agriculture ministry
official told Reuters on Monday [17 Oct 2005]. He was commenting on a
newspaper report that 10 dead starlings found near Zagreb had been sent to
a veterinary institute for testing.
The starlings had no visible injuries, which prompted citizens to suspect
bird flu, the Jutarnji List daily said, but added they were often poisoned
by farmers defending their crops. Starlings are not regular inhabitants of
wetlands but are migratory and might have been in contact with infected birds.
"We react promptly to every report, take samples and analyze them, but so
far nothing has been found. People are really overreacting, but we are
taking all precautionary measures," the official said.
In Brussels, the European Union's executive Commission urged all countries
where dead birds were found to carry out tests as soon as possible.
"All birds will have to be tested to see whether they are carrying avian
influenza virus," European Commission health spokesman Philip Tod told a
daily briefing. "This should be done as quickly as possible where there is
a suspicion."
Croatian Agriculture Ministry spokesman Mladen Pavic told Reuters there was
no cause for alarm.
"There is no bird flu in Croatia, nor do we suspect there might be.
Everything we're doing is out of precaution," he said.
Croatia and Serbia lie on one of the main routes migratory birds from
Europe use to go to Africa, where they could be in contact with infected
birds. Initial tests of migratory wild fowl in Croatia were negative.
Over the weekend [15-16 Oct 2005], British laboratory tests identified the
lethal H5N1 virus in ducks found dead in Romania.

[As expected, the public's aroused concern, mainly in Europe and the
Middle-East, in the wake of H5N1 detection in Romania and Turkey is
producing an increased number of calls to health authorities, prompting the
due epidemiological and laboratory investigations. Useful guidance to the
public can be found at 20051014.2994, item 4. Among other things, it says:
"Waterbirds are potentially among the most vulnerable wild birds.
Obviously, all birdwatchers encounter dead birds occasionally, almost all
due to perfectly natural causes, so use your common sense. However, if you
should come across an incident that seems out of the ordinary, this should
be reported." - Mod.AS]
