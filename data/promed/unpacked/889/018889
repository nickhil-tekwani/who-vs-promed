Farmers from Kabarole district [Western Region] are calling for assistance after a strange disease [ProMED post 20210601.8413562] struck their banana plantations. According to the farmers, the disease turns the banana plant brown and the fruit is tasteless.

[A number of banana pathogens have been reported from the region, for example, _Banana bunchy top virus_; bacterial wilt (in central Africa caused by _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_, BXW); fungal diseases including black and yellow sigatoka (_Mycosphaerella_ species), Panama disease (_Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_, including tropical race 4, TR4), anthracnose (_Colletotrichum_ species). BXW first appeared in Uganda in 2001 (ProMED post 20020105.3162) and has been spreading in the region since then. An outbreak of anthracnose in the Western Region was suspected in 2020 (ProMED post 20200214.6987577). (For more information, see previous ProMED posts in the archives.)

An undiagnosed disease of banana has been reported in the same district in Uganda already less than a year ago, in 2021 (ProMED post 20210601.8413562). Unfortunately, it seems possible that the problem reported above may still be the same issue which has so far remained unresolved. The symptoms reported in Kabarole above and previously are not sufficient to speculate on a causal disease or disorder. The problems may also be due to a combination of one or several pathogens and/or other factors. As always, reliable diagnosis is required as a basis for designing control or management strategies for the affected farmers.
