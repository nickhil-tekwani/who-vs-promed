15 villagers are reported to have been hospitalised after they consumed meat from cattle infected with anthrax.

Makoni District recently experienced an outbreak of anthrax with 12 cattle reported to have died so far since January [2016]. Newzimbabwe.com also reported last week that about 22 villagers were hospitalised in Bikita after eating beef infected with anthrax. A Health ministry official, Perpetua Chiwandire, confirmed that 15 patients were hospitalised after eating meat infected with anthrax.

"Farmers should desist from eating cattle that have died from anthrax. Those who think they have eaten meat from cattle suspected to have died of anthrax should seek urgent medical attention," Chiwandire told a Makoni Rural District Development Committee meeting last week.

Makoni Veterinary services Officer Farai Musuka said that they have embarked on a massive campaign to educate local communities about the dangers of anthrax. He said the affected areas include Maparura, Chitenderano, Chinhenga, Rugoyi, Tandi and Chiware. "We are worried that villagers in these communities are consuming the carcasses of cattle that have died of anthrax. As such, we are carrying out awareness campaigns in the affected communities, educating them on the hazards of consuming cattle that died of anthrax," said Musuka.

He said shortages of vaccines at the veterinary department were impacting negatively on their efforts to vaccinate the cattle district-wide. "Due to shortages of vaccines in our stock, we are encouraging villagers to buy their own vaccine to treat their cattle," said Musuka. He added: "As a department, we also encourage farmers to apply the quarantine method so as to control the spread of the bacteria."

Anthrax is caused by _Bacillus anthracis_ bacteria that cause the deaths of cattle without signs of illness. Blood will come out through the nose and rectum, and the animal may show signs of fever and shivering.

[Public prayer in the face of an infectious disease rarely gets one far, and even less likely in the face of rural poverty and malnutrition, when the temptation to butcher and consume the meat from a dead cow is over-riding. And butchering these carcasses will only increase the chances for more bovine deaths, frankly, a ghastly situation.

Makoni is in Manicaland Province, which is along the eastern border of Zimbabwe with Mozambique. For a map of Zimbabwe, go to: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/zimbabwe_physio-2002.jpg.
