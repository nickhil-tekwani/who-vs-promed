Re: Norovirus infection control
-------------------------------
The Moderator's comments [on transmission of norovirus infection]
(see: Norovirus, hospitals - Australia (QLD 20070724.2375) do not
recognize adequately the importance of person-to-person spread of
norovirus. The virus is highly infectious: diners eating at a table
where a previous diner has vomited (and which has been cleaned with
detergent but not with viricide (e.g. hypochlorite-containing fluid)
have become ill; and droplet spread seems very likely to occur.
Simple hand-washing and food-preparation precautions are necessary
but not sufficient to prevent spread in health care settings.
