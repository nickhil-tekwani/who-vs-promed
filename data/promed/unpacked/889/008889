PARASTRONGYLUS CANTONENSIS, HORSE - USA (LOUISIANA)
===================================================
Date: Tue, 4 Mar 1997 17:39:36 -0600
From: mehj2020@vt8200.vetmed.lsu.edu
I have just been informed, by note, by my colleague Dr Bonner Stewart that
he has positively identified the above worm, previously known as
Angiostrongylus cantonensis, from the spinal cord of a horse from
Franklinton, LA. P. cantonensis is a normal lung parasite of rats in the
Pacific basin, SE Asia, and Australia, and is responsible for the "tropical
eosinophilia" syndrome of humans.
