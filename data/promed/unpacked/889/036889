Diseased Queensland citrus trees to burn
---------------------------------------------
Emerald's canker disease-infected citrus trees would be burned on Mon 12
Jul 2004, Queensland Primary Industries Minister Henry Palaszczuk says. He
said the Department of Primary Industries (DPI) had no alternative but to
destroy the 8000 trees already affected, before the disease wiped out the
state's USD 120 million citrus industry.
The discovery of citrus canker -- which does not harm humans but causes
lesions on mandarins, oranges, limes, and grapefruit, and, reduces the
appeal to consumers -- at Emerald's Evergreen Farms resulted in a
nationwide ban on Queensland citrus at midnight on 6 Jul 2004. Palaszczuk
said the infected crops would be copper-sprayed, before being removed from
the ground, and chopped up in preparation for burning.
100 DPI officers are on the ground to combat the outbreak through
surveillance, logistics, and plantings. Palaszczuk said, so far, DPI
inspection officers had failed to find any trace of citrus canker outside
the 1st infection zone. He said that, if the disease spreads, the level of
destruction could involve up to 100 000 trees.
The update came after the government managed to partially reopen the
southern market for growers outside the quarantine area, in the Atherton
Tablelands, along the coast, and, also, in the south-east corner around
Gatton. Palaszczuk said this concession had come at a price, however, with
growers now required to have their fruit inspected, treated, and then
certified by a DPI inspector. He said certification alone was expected to
cost about USD 1 million, but the government had chosen to waive this fee
for 90 days under the circumstances.
Palaszczuk said the government was now also working on protocols to allow
fruit from large growing areas of Gayndah and Mundubbera (north-west of
Brisbane) to access the southern markets. He said, however, he had no way
of knowing how long it would take for the National Management Group, which
governs the southern markets, to lift the ban.
Palaszczuk said the good news for other Emerald growers, who were also
under quarantine, but, had no evidence of canker, was that their fruit
would soon be able to be picked and exported to countries already infected
with citrus canker.
DPI plant health general manager Chris Adriaansen said that the picking of
those trees would commence shortly, with the fruit transported under strict
and secure conditions. Emerald Mayor Peter Maguire said there was a lot of
anger in the Emerald community, with the other 5 community growers anxious
to have their crops given the all-clear, and, to get back to work

[This is the 4th outbreak of citrus canker in Australia, the previous
outbreaks being in 1993, 1991, and 1924. There are distinct types of citrus
canker disease caused by various pathovars, and variants, of the bacterium
_X. axonopodis_ (syns. _X. campestris_, _X. citri_). Because symptoms are
generally similar, separation of these types from each other is based on
host range, cultural and physiological characteristics, bacteriophage
sensitivity, serology, plasmid fingerprints, DNA-DNA homology, and, by
various RFLP and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) analyses. The latter
DNA-based assays demonstrate that these strain types are genetically, as
well as pathologically, unique.
Disease management relies on the use of more resistant types of citrus,
such as Valencia oranges and mandarins, use of cultural practices that
reduce disease severity (allowing vegetation to reduce wind-blown sand,
planting of windbreaks, and, avoidance of working in infected areas when
trees are wet from dew or rain, because bacteria ooze from lesions onto
moist surfaces). Frequent applications of copper-containing bactericide
sprays have been shown to be somewhat effective in suppression of the
disease but are not cost effective.
