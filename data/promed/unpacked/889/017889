Meningitis deaths rise to 13
----------------------------
Deaths from the meningitis outbreak in West Pokot District have risen
to 13, the Health ministry said yesterday [13 Feb 2006] as it
announced a campaign to fight the disease. Director of Medical
Services, Dr. James Nyikal, said 55 cases had been reported by 11 Feb
2006.
Kacheliba has the highest number of cases, with 31 people diagnosed
with the deadly disease. Alale is 2nd with 17, while Kasei and
Chepareria have had 3 cases each, and Kapenguria one.
"Most cases have been reported at Kacheliba and Alale divisions,
specifically Konyao sub-location, because they are bordering affected
districts in Uganda," Dr. Nyikal told the Press at Kenyatta
International Conference Center. The disease broke out in Uganda in
late 2005 but was only reported in Kenya 2 weeks ago.
Dr. Nyikal said a team from the Health ministry was immediately sent
to the area to deal with the problem. "Enough drugs have been sent to
all health facilities," he added.
Following the outbreak, Turkana and Trans Nzoia districts have also
been put on alert.
The Government, the DMS added, had ordered vaccines from the WHO
headquarters in Geneva for emergency vaccination. Dr. Joyce Onsongo
of the WHO Disease Control and Prevention unit said the emergency
stocks were kept in Geneva because it was expensive for countries to
stock the drugs.
"The disease has a recurrence cycle of 10 years, and, as a result, it
is not cost- effective to stock the medicines in individual
countries," she said.

Meningococcal disease in Uganda - update
----------------------------------------
From 28 Dec 2005 to 3 Feb 2006, 301 suspected cases of meningococcal
disease, including 23 deaths, have been reported from the districts
of Nakapiripirit (258 cases, 19 deaths) and Moroto (43 cases, 4
deaths) in northeastern Uganda. Laboratory tests have confirmed
_Neisseria meningitis_ serotype A (see previous report).
The International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for
Epidemic Meningitis Control has provided 250 000 doses of bivalent
vaccine for a mass vaccination campaign as well as 10 000 doses of
oily chloramphenicol for case management. The immunization campaign
has started in both districts. Reports of suspected cases in 5
neighboring districts are also being investigated.

[A depot form of chloramphenicol is commonly used in a one dose
treatment (4 grams intramuscularly) for the treatment of
meningococcal disease. In a recent publication -- Nathan N, Borel T,
Djibo A, et al: Ceftriaxone as effective as long- acting
chloramphenicol in short-course treatment of meningococcal meningitis
during epidemics: a randomized non-inferiority study. Lancet 2005;
366: 308-13 -- it performed quite well.
Abstract:
In sub-Saharan Africa in the 1990s, more than 600 000 people had
epidemic meningococcal meningitis, of whom 10 percent died. The
current recommended treatment by WHO is short-course long-acting oily
chloramphenicol. Continuation of the production of this drug is
uncertain, so simple alternatives need to be found. We assessed
whether the efficacy of single-dose treatment of ceftriaxone was
non-inferior to that of oily chloramphenicol for epidemic
meningococcal meningitis.
In 2003, we undertook a randomized, open-label, non-inferiority trial
in 9 health-care facilities in Niger. Participants with suspected
disease who were older than 2 months were randomly assigned to
receive either chloramphenicol or ceftriaxone. Primary outcome was
treatment failure (defined as death or clinical failure) at 72 h,
measured with intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses.
Of 510 individuals with suspected disease, 247 received ceftriaxone,
256 received chloramphenicol, and 7 were lost to follow-up. The
treatment failure rate at 72 h for the intention-to-treat analysis
was 9 percent (22 patients) for both drug groups (risk difference 0.3
percent, 90 percent CI -3.8 to 4.5). Case fatality rates and clinical
failure rates were equivalent in both treatment groups (14 [6
percent] ceftriaxone vs. 12 [5 percent] chloramphenicol). Results
were also similar for both treatment groups in individuals with
confirmed meningitis caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_. No adverse
side-effects were reported.
Single-dose ceftriaxone provides an alternative treatment for
epidemic meningococcal meningitis; its efficacy, ease of use, and low
cost favor its use. National and international health partners should
consider ceftriaxone as an alternative 1st-line treatment to
chloramphenicol for epidemic meningococcal meningitis. - Mod.LL]

Health dept reviews meningitis, no need to panic
------------------------------------------------
Meningococcal meningitis is quickly spreading, as 105 cases of the
disease have been confirmed from all hospitals in the capital. The
medical superintendents of all city hospitals today [13 Feb 2006]
presented the list of confirmed cases in a meeting with the Director
General of Health Services (DGHS), R.K. Srivastava.
The meeting had been called by the DGHS to decide on the future
course of action. Dr. Srivastava, however, said there is nothing to
worry about but that it is necessary for the hospitals to be careful.
"As per the list presented by all hospitals, 105 cases of meningitis
have been confirmed," said Dr. K K Bhalla, Deputy Health Officer,
Municipal Corporation of Delhi, Najafgarh zone, (MCD). All hospital
officials have been instructed to be more vigilant and careful.
Another meeting will be held to assess the situation after 15 days.
In the summer of 2005, the disease had killed more than 50 people and
affected another 400. While the doctors and the paramedical staff in
all the hospitals have been vaccinated for the disease, the hospital
authorities have started giving preventive treatment with
ciprofloxacin to all the contacts of the patients.
