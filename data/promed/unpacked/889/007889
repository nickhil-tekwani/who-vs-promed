Incidence of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the United Kingdom:

In the IFST Position Statement on BSE and in discussions on various
listserves, it has long been pointed out that the "calendar year of death"
approach still generally quoted ("3, 10, 10") was absurd, both because date
of death is not a meaningful benchmark and because calendar year is far too
crude a time measure; and that the best available benchmark was best
estimate of date of clinical onset.
Robert LaBudde's paper on the frequency of incidence of nvCJD cases
attempted to do that. Hampered by lack of requested help from CJDSU on the
dates, he used best estimates of dates from various sources including help
from Hans Andersson. The paper was submitted to The Lancet but was rejected.
In his evidence to the BSE Inquiry on 3 June, Robert Will, Director of
CJDSU, showed a graph (not included in the transcript) using CJDU's best
knowledge of dates of clinical onset, revealing that he reaches exactly the
same conclusion that Robert LaBudde reached, that the rate of incidence of
nvCJD has been constant, and remains so a year further on. Here is the
relevant extract from the evidence transcript.
"Finally, I just thought I would put up the current situation as of 1st
June. These are all the cases of new variant CJD listed according to
clinical onset. The solid line represents the total illness duration. The
square is notification to a CJD unit. The triangle is death, and the star
is confirmation of prion.
The reason I put this up is just to show that as far as disease onsets are
concerned, new variant CJD seems to be occurring almost of constant
incidence,...
