_E. coli_ [infections linked to Montgomery County, Pennsylvania farm
--------------------------------------------------------
Montgomery County health officials have linked 11 confirmed cases and one
suspected case of _E. coli_ infection in children to a petting zoo at
Merrymead Farm in Worcester Township. Health Department director Robert
Gage acknowledged yesterday that if his agency - which first learned of the
infection in mid-September - had taken steps earlier to cordon off the zoo
area, fewer children might have been infected.

"Clearly, it would have been in everyone's best interest to have contact
with the cattle eliminated as soon as possible," Gage said at a news
conference.

The children, ages one through 10, visited the farm separately, health
officials said. A total of 8 have been hospitalized, and 6 of those have
developed a condition known as hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can result
in kidney damage, the officials said.

One of the children, a 3-year-old from Montgomery County being treated for
kidney failure at Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, was
listed last night in critical but stable condition.

[This outbreak is one of several that have been attributed to petting zoos
worldwide, although the US CDC website does not list petting zoos as one of
the risk factors, but refers to a "small number of farms" at which animals
may be infected with _E. coli_ O157:H7. It might be wise for health
agencies to require periodic screening of petting zoo animals as a
condition for licensure. - Mod.ES
