[There is an ongoing drought in Wajir but as my colleague wisely commented to me: "Per the report, there were short rains in the county early December 2022, after a period of drought. They always say that heavy rains are the curse of Northeastern Kenya as in Wajir and Garissa, since they mainly lead to anthrax and Rift Valley fever outbreaks. As there is always news on camel deaths in this area, it may be good to get confirmation that anthrax breaks out there." We have seen this anthrax response to brief rain in drought in West Texas, for anthrax outbreaks in white-tailed deer and cattle 10 days after the rain. So this may well be what has happened in Wajir, Kenya. - Mod.MHJ]

Just a day after the Nakuru county government warned residents of Kuresoi South against eating meat that has not been inspected by the health officer due to the outbreaks of anthrax and rabies, a 10-year-old boy died for violating the order. According to the residents of the village of Tinet, his brother-in-law cooked bone soup made from beef that died after suffering from East Coast fever.

More than 30 other residents who participated in this meal continue to receive treatment at Olenguruone sub-district hospital after experiencing symptoms of stomach upset, motion sickness and body pain.

The deputy governor, David Kones, who visited the victims at the health center, asked the residents to pay attention to the instructions given to avoid such cases in the future, stressing that the order given yesterday [7 Jan 2023] through the county's ministry of agriculture would still be in place until these diseases end. Kones continued to say that it would be good if everyone took responsibility to make sure that the meat they eat is fully inspected and not wait until the disease occurs, to help reduce the disaster that occurs in this sample.

The elder of the village, Charles Korir, said that many got this meat from places where illegal alcohol was being replaced by meat.

11 adults and 6 children have been admitted and continue to receive treatment at the Olenguruone hospital while others have been treated and allowed to go home.

His [son's] body has also been taken to the mortuary of this hospital.

[A formal confirmation of "anthrax" has yet to be reported but the pattern of this outbreak matches anthrax outbreaks seen in villages consuming meat from infected carcasses. The previous report had 7 children and 20 adults hospitalized. In this report some 30 initially were under treatment which is not significantly different but now 11 adults and 6 children continue to be under hospital treatment. With thanks to Mahmoud. - Mod.MHJ
