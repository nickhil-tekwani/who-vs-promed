Despite fumigations, the transmission of diseases
[pathogens] by mosquitoes does not cease in the
country. In Cordoba, the "St. Louis encephalitis"
or equine virus has reappeared, where there are
now 9 people infected, while specialists indicate
that this virus is more fatal than that of dengue.

In fact, in September 2005, an epidemiological
alert was issued in this province because this
virus caused 8 deaths and 48 infections
[clinical, see reference below] caused by the
bites of "assassin mosquitoes," as they were
termed by physicians at that time.

A spokesperson of the health unit in Cordoba,
Oscar Gonzales in charge, assured [the public]
that "the disease is controlled" and indicated
that although official reporting is obligatory,
the channel for dialogue in this case is with the
National Ministry of Health.

The press communicated with the National Ministry
of Health but the only official authorized to
speak, the National Director of Epidemiology,
Horacio Echenique, was traveling in the interior
of the country and this type of information is
public and must be communicated by national
[health] authorities. On this occasion, the
information was not released through official
channels. Alejandro Lambruschini, President of
Opcion Verde and member of the Association of
Professionals for Disease Management of the
Republic of Argentina, stated that he received a
call from the Cordoba government alerting him to
the appearance of "various cases of equine
encephalitis." Lambruschini, who carried out work
for mosquito control in Catamarca and Santiago
del Estero, was consulted by the provincial
government to provide disinfection [pest control]
and fumigation services in the provincial capital.

Why will there be more problems? In Cordoba
various cases of equine encephalitis have
appeared, which is a disease much more lethal
than dengue. Dengue can be an epidemiological
problem but equine [St. Louis] encephalitis has a
[case] fatality rate of 50 percent. Moreover, it
was indicated that in the city of Buenos Aires,
thanks to the high humidity indices yesterday [20
Mar 2010] demand increased for disinfections
[pest control], "we have begun to have a greater
demand for disinfections [pest control], mainly
for mosquitoes. Currently, we have a wave of
_Culex_ mosquitoes in the city which we are
attacking correspondingly."

The disease [virus] is transmitted through wild
or peridomestic birds which are carriers
[reservoirs or amplifiers but not persistently
infected carriers. - Mod.TY], and then mosquitoes
become infected when they bite [viremic] birds
and finally the mosquito vectors can infect
humans or more birds and animals. In fact, the
abundance of mosquitoes in this season plus the
movement of migratory birds favor the propagation
of the virus, of the flavivirus family.

[Infections of humans and equines in Argentina
with St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) have
been recognized for a long time. Although there
have been no recent reports posted on ProMED for
SLEV there, several reports from Cordoba,
Argentina have been published recently.

auriculata, Columbidae) as host for St. Louis
encephalitis virus (Flaviviridae, Flavivirus).

Human outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis detected
in Argentina, 2005. J Clin Virol. 2008 42:27-33.
Summary: The epidemic curve of 47 cases showed an
explosive outbreak starting in January 2005 with
one peak in mid-February and a 2nd peak in
mid-March; the epidemic ended in May. Cases
occurred predominantly among persons 60 years and
older. Nine deaths were reported. SLEV
antibodies, when detected in 47 patients studied,
had a pattern characteristic of a primary SLEV
infection. CONCLUSIONS: Even though isolated
cases of St. Louis encephalitis have been
reported in Argentina, this is the 1st
description of a large SLEV encephalitis outbreak
in Argentina.
