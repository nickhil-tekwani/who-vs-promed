Increased parvovirus B19 activity in England and Wales
------------------------------------------------------
Parvovirus B19 causes the common childhood illness, erythema infectiosum or fifth disease -- widely known as "slapped cheek" due to the typical presentation of erythematous cheeks which, together with rash and fever, are characteristic of this disease. Parvovirus B19 infection is generally a mild febrile illness, but in patients with increased red blood cell turnover (i.e., underlying haemolytic haemoglobulinopathies) infection can lead to transient aplastic crisis, and pure red cell aplasia in the immunocompromised. Infection in the 1st 20 weeks of pregnancy is associated with increased risk of intrauterine death and hydrops fetalis. For these reasons, a recently observed increased parvovirus B19 activity in England and Wales warrants increased vigilance by clinicians and awareness of relevant available guidance on diagnosis and management of the infection.

Approximately 50-60 percent of individuals will have already been infected with parvovirus B19 by the time they reach adulthood. Infection in temperate countries like the UK is seasonal, with increases in infection in spring and early summer, with additional increases in incidence occurring every 3-4 years. The infection is not a notifiable disease and, whilst most of the disease burden is known to lie in young children, testing is largely biased towards pregnant women because of the potential serious consequences and the demonstration that the complications of in-utero infection can be successfully treated with fetal transfusion. There is currently no licensed vaccine for parvovirus B19.

Despite the recognised bias in ascertainment, confirmed cases this year suggest an increase in parvovirus B19 activity relative to the previous 2 years: activity is similar to that seen in 2009. The increase is apparent for both PCR-positive samples submitted to the HPA Virus Reference Department at Colindale and confirmed infections reported to Labbase. The highest numbers of cases have been confirmed in the South West and South East Regions but the numbers of reports in all Regions, other than the North East, are higher in 2012 than a comparable period in 2011 (see original document for the tabulated data).

This news item is intended to draw attention to the current increased parvovirus B19 activity and to highlight available NHS Clinical Knowledge Summaries [2] and HPA guidelines for managing the infection in health care settings, the community [3] and in pregnant women [4].

[Fifth disease is caused by human parvovirus B19. It often affects preschoolers or school-age children during the spring. The disease is spread by contact with respiratory secretions and usually return for 5 days. However, the rash associated with fifth disease may return for several weeks. Return of the rash may be brought on by sunlight, heat, exercise, fever, or emotional stress. The 1st sign of the disease is usually bright red cheeks, which look as though the child has been recently slapped on both sides of the face. Following this, a rash appears on the arms and legs and middle of the body. The rash fades from the center outwards, giving it a lacy appearance. Over a period of 1 to 2 weeks, the rash completely goes away. Fifth disease is also sometimes associated with fever.

If a pregnant woman becomes infected with parvovirus B19, it can cause significant harm to her unborn baby. Any pregnant woman who believes that she may have been in contact with a person who has this virus should talk to her health care provider. Parvovirus B19 is also thought to cause other diseases, including an infectious form of arthritis. The majority of adults seem to have antibodies to parvovirus B19. This indicates that most people have been exposed to the virus, and also suggests that many infections go unnoticed.
