WEST NILE VIRUS UPDATE 2002 - USA (11)
**************************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.promedmail.org>
ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases
<http://www.isid.org>
[Previously I made the comment that: "The USGS/CINDI West Nile Virus
National and State Maps
(<http://cindi.usgs.gov/hazard/event/west_nile/west_nile.html>) list
cumulative WNV positive results together with the dates of reporting of
individual cases. These maps appear to be updated at irregular intervals
and lag behind the current situation. Nonetheless the maps provide a
valuable graphic picture of the progress of the WNV epidemic in 2002."
In response, Dr Stephen C. Guptill of the USGS has provided the following
background information: "The USGS/CINDI maps are produced using
surveillance data reported to CDC via ArboNET and verified by
states/jurisdictions as of the date indicated on the maps. If the data seem
incomplete, this is due to either a lag in the official reporting of
positive findings to CDC (some of which may already be in the public
domain, or at least common knowledge in public health circles), or a delay
in the electronic verification by states/jurisdictions of reports they have
submitted to CDC. It is our standard procedure to download this information
every Monday morning. It takes us about 12 hours to create/update all the
maps and update the web pages. Usually we have the new maps available by
noon on Tuesday (EDT). During the week of 1 Jul 2002, security issues
required us to take the computer serving the WNV maps off-line for a period
of time. When computer operations were restored the most current set of WNV
maps (dated 1 Jul 2002) was not installed, but rather the maps from 24 Jun
2002. The 1 Jul 2002 maps have now been placed on the server; the 8 Jul
2002 maps should be available on Tue 10 July 2002. We plan to move the web
site for the WNV maps to a more robust/secure server in the near future."
ProMED-mail greatly appreciates Dr. Guptill's helpful response.
As of 12 Jul 2002, it appears that the raw data provided to Dr. Guptill by
ArboNET are being released as a weekly summary in MMWR (see part 12 of this
update). As a consequence, henceforth the ProMED-mail updates will be
posted mid-week rather than at the end of a week to allow readers to place
the reports in the updates in their current context. - Mod.CP]

Illinois: Dead Crow Tests West Nile Virus-positive in Boone County
------------------------------------------------------------------
BELVIDERE: A dead crow found in western Boone County this week was infected
with the West Nile virus, moving the disease ever closer to Winnebago
County. The bird was found Monday by a Boone County homeowner. Infected
birds have been found in Sangamon, DeKalb, Will, Whiteside, Stephenson,
Lake, DuPage and Cook counties.
The virus has appeared in several states since the first United States case
was discovered in New York in 1999. Illinois first saw the disease in May
2001. Last week, 4 dead crows in Sangamon, DeKalb and Will counties tested
positive.
Dr. Mike Thomas, the health department's epidemiologist, believes the virus
arrived in the county late last summer even though, so far, the county has
not had any crows test positive. Two dead crows from Winnebago County
tested negative last week. "Last year, West Nile virus activity peaked in
September, and I expect the risk will be slightly increasing as the summer
goes on," Thomas said.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
DALLAS: State and county health officials have confirmed the first cases of
West Nile virus outside of southeast Texas.Two blue jays found dead in
Dallas-area neighborhoods have tested positive for the deadly disease. One

birds were found dead on 27 and 28 Jun 2002.
The virus was confirmed in Montgomery County last week and in Jefferson

crows and a horse in Harris County.
Meanwhile, Lee Chastante, head of Jefferson County's mosquito control
efforts, said a veterinarian in Fannett had 2 confirmed cases of West Nile
virus in horses. One horse was put to sleep. The other is recovering.

Alabama: West Nile Virus Detected in a Blue Jay and 4 Pools of Mosquitoes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Alabama Department of Public Health announced that a blue jay found
dead in Ozark on 27 Jun 2002 had tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV).
Although it is the first WNV-positive bird found in Dale County this year,
16 other dead birds infected with WNV have been found in 7 counties
throughout the state in 2002. Ongoing public health surveillance for the
virus has detected no infections in horses or humans in Alabama to date.
WNV was also found in southern house mosquitoes in Enterprise. The southern
house mosquito is commonly found in urban and suburban communities as well
as rural areas. They will breed readily in storm sewers, ditches, waste
lagoons and in artificial containers around one's home.
Officials said 163 birds from 32 counties had been tested for WNV as of Fri
12 Jul 2002. Mosquito surveillance will be increased with the detection of
these positives. Tests from some other Alabama counties are pending.

Alabama: West Nile Virus-positive bird Count Reaches 19
-------------------------------------------------------
FOLEY: Two dead Baldwin County blue jays have positive for West Nile virus
on Fri 12 Jul 2002. State health officials predict the virus will be found
in every Alabama county this year. It has spread quickly since it was first
detected in the United States in 1999 and is considered to be an indicator
of the presence of an even more fatal mosquito-borne virus, Eastern equine
encephalitis virus.
The blue jays, found in Foley and Marlow, were tested at an Auburn
University laboratory Thursday. Seventeen other dead birds, found in
locations across the state, have tested positive for West Nile virus so far
this year, according to the health department.

Ohio: More Birds Test West Nile Virus-positive
----------------------------------------------
NEW HAVEN: A third blue jay, found dead near Celeryville, has tested
positive for West Nile virus, according to the Huron County General Health
District. Elyria and Sandusky also got confirmations late this week of dead
birds infected with the virus being discovered in those cities.
The bird was found on 23 Jun 20023 in New Haven Township and tested by the
Ohio Department of Health, Martin Tremmel, Huron County Health
commissioner, said. Within the past month, dead birds in Lorain, Huron and
Erie counties have tested positive for the virus, officials said. West Nile
virus made its initial appearance in Erie County on Wednesday when test
results from a dead grackle discovered 27 Jun 2002 in the eastern portion
of Sandusky came back positive, according to Karen Gerold of the county's
General Health District. Elyria has had 2 cases confirmed this year
including the most recent one on Thursday, according to Dave Oakes, the
director of environmental health for the city of Elyria. Oakes said the
first case was confirmed 1 Jul 2002 by the Ohio Department of Health which
tested a dead blue jay found 20 Jun 2002 in the East Avenue area. The
second case, confirmed yesterday, was discovered in a dead blue jay found
on 28 Jun 2002 along Abbe Road. The first case of West Nile virus in Lorain
County was positively identified in a dead blue jay found 14 Jun 2002 in
New Russia Township.
