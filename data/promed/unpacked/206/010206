One Ohio woman lost her vision in one eye after her pet cat licked it -- a reminder about the infectious disease risk of cat licks and bites caused by the agent of cat scratch disease (CSD) -- _Bartonella henselae_.

Toledo News Now reports that [the patient] said she woke up one morning and couldn't see out her left eye. After a month of examination and investigation, physicians determined [the patient's] blindness was due to the Gram negative bacterium [_Bartonella henselae_].

People typically get infected from a bite, scratch or a lick. It is usually a benign, self-limiting disease in immunocompetent people. Frequently only flu-like symptoms and a red papule lesion at the site of the scratch are present.

However, as Dr Kris Brickman tells the Toledo news source, "It can affect the eyes, because what it does is increases blood vessels that creates problems -- called antinomies," Brickman said. "It can also cause some liver problems [hepatitis] and can get into the spinal fluids and create meningitis."

In addition to neuroretinitis, hepatitis and meningitis, CSD complications, seen in about 10 per cent of cases, can include hearing loss, endocarditis, osteomyelitis [bone infection] and pneumonia. It should be noted that complications are most often found in immunocompromised patients and rarely in individuals with normal immune systems.

As around 4 out of 10 cats and kittens can carry CSD, handwashing after handling your pet is key. "Don't let [cats] lick any open wounds, and try not to get bit [sic] by any cat," Brickman added.

[Cat-scratch disease (CSD) in humans is caused by an intracellular Gram negative bacterium, _Bartonella henselae_. Cats are the reservoir for _B. henselae_ and cat fleas transmit _B. henselae_ between cats (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8667399). Asymptomatic _B. henselae_ bacteremia has been documented in up to 41 per cent of healthy cats and _B. henselae_ bacteremia is commonest in younger cats, typically kittens older than 3 months (http://www.cdc.gov/bartonella/veterinarians/). Bacteremia in cats can persist for months.

In a study of 1200 cases with CSD (Carithers HA. Cat-scratch disease. An overview based on a study of 1200 patients. Am J Dis Child. 1985;139(11):1124-33), cat contact was established for 99.1 per cent of cases, and the cat was immature in most cases. An inoculation site lesion (one or more 3- to 5-mm red-brown nontender papules, 3-10 days after the bacteria are introduced) was detected in 92.6 per cent. Lymphadenopathy develops several weeks later in regional nodes draining the inoculation site. Regional adenopathy may persist for several months. Approximately 10-30 per cent of nodes may suppurate and may require needle aspiration.

Up to about 15 per cent of cases develop complicated CSD (ocular involvement, hepatosplenic abscesses, osteomyletitis, endocarditis, and thrombocytopenic purpura). Immunocompromised people, such as organ transplant patients, those undergoing immunosuppressive treatments for cancer, and people with HIV/AIDS) are more likely than others to develop complicated CSD.

Ocular involvement includes Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome (POGS), bacillary angiomatosis, orbital abscess, and neuroretinitis. Usually only one eye is affected. POGS, the most common ocular manifestation of CSD, is a "granulomatous" conjunctivitis, fever, malaise, plus regional preauricular adenopathy (http://www.uveitissociety.org/pages/diseases/csd.html). Patients who develop neuroretinitis (swelling of the optic nerve and retina, nerve fiber layer hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, multiple discrete lesions in the deep retina, and stellate macular exudates) may notice alteration of vision, sometimes with an enlarged blind spot (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9499776). Vision returns in over 90 per cent of patients in most reported case series of patients with neuroretinitis (http://www.uveitissociety.org/pages/diseases/csd.html).

Serologic testing for antibodies to _B. henselae_ is commonly used for laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis of CSD; but since 30 per cent of asymptomatic cat owners are seropositive for _B. henselae_ antibodies, the presence of antibodies is not sufficient to make the diagnosis of CSD (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC95604/). The use of a PCR-based assay allows detection of _B. henselae_-specific DNA sequences in clinical specimens (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC228218/pdf/331573.pdf).

Azithromycin, rifampin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and gentamicin have all been found to be effective (Bass JW, et al. Prospective randomized double blind placebo-controlled evaluation of azithromycin for treatment of cat-scratch disease. Pediatr Infect Dis J. 1998;17:447-452; Margelith A. Antibiotic therapy for cat-scratch disease: clinical study of therapeutic outcome in 268 patients and a review of the literature. Pediatr Infect Dis J. 1992;11:474-478); but since recovery usually occurs in uncomplicated CSD in immunocompetent patients with or without treatment, the need for antibiotic treatment in these patients is controversial. Recovery may take several months. - Mod.ML
