1). Louisiana and Kentucky had never previously had WNV infection detected

The other 61 cases are in horses from 16 counties in Florida: Baker (Glen
St. Mary, 1), Clay (Maxville, 1; Middleburg, 1), Duval (Bryceville, 1;
Jacksonville, 2), Gadsden (Havana, 1), Hamilton (Jennings, 1), Holmes

available also tested positive at the NVSL on reverse transcriptase-nested
polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) performed on those tissues.
