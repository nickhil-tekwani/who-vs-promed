Banana disease confirmed on eastern Big Isle
Agriculture officials are examining the extent of the bunchy-top virus
---------------------------------------------------
Banana bunchy-top virus (BBTV) has been confirmed for the 1st time on the
Big Island's east side, the state's main banana-producing region.
The state Department of Agriculture is checking banana plants at Keaau
Banana Plantation, one of the state's largest banana growers, and at
surrounding banana farms to determine the extent of the disease, said Kyle
Onuma, of the department's Hilo office.
Richard Ha, president of Keaau Banana Plantation, believes that about 35
acres of Williams bananas on his 200-acre plantation might have the
disease. Ha will meet with Agriculture Department and University of Hawaii
experts on how to cope with the disease next week. "I think we can deal
with it," he said.
According to state Agriculture Chairwoman Sandra Lee Kunimoto, if BBTV is
found to be widespread in Keaau, it could severely impact the state's
$8.4-million banana industry. Commercial banana plantings and plants in
backyards will be assessed by Department of Agriculture personnel to
determine the extent of the problem.
BBTV stunts growth in the banana plant's crown, hence the bunchy
appearance. Younger leaves might have yellowish, curling edges; and lower
leaf stems and midribs might have streaks, blotches or a "Morse code"
pattern, according to the Agriculture Department. Infected plants produce
deformed and stunted fruit and eventually fail to produce fruit.
The disease is transmitted by banana aphids, and there is no known cure.
Infected plants disease are treated for aphids and destroyed, Onuma said.
Since 1999 more than 175 000 banana plants have been eradicated in North
Kona after BBTV was discovered there. The virus also is present on Kauai
from Hanalei to Lawai; on Maui in Pukalani and Makawao; and is widespread
on Oahu.
Sales figures for banana production in 2002, the most recent year for which
figures were available, were: Big Island, 815 acres, $6.34 million; Oahu,
460 acres, $1.46 million; Maui, 85 acres, $330 000; and Kauai, 80 acres,
$256 000.
Statewide production of bananas was 19.5 million pounds in 2002. Oahu
production is less per acre than that of the Big Island because of BBTV,
said agriculture spokeswoman Janelle Saneishi.

[BBTV is a member of the genus Nanovirus, not the genus Nanavirus named
earlier. Other members are Faba bean necrotic yellows, Milk vetch dwarf and
Subterranean clover stunt (type species). Their genomes consist of multiple
circular ssDNAs of about 1 kb. BBTV, transmitted by the banana aphid
(_Pentalonia nigronervosa_), is the most destructive viral disease of
banana [_Musa x paridasiaca_, _M. acuminata_ and _M. textilis_, a
Philippine plant known as abaca (Manila hemp)]. BBTV spreads in the African
region and the Pacific region; Australia, Burundi, Egypt, Gabon, the
Philippines, and Taiwan. BBTV epidemics of the disease have devastated many
plantations in the Bicol Region of the Philippines for more than 50 years.
Disease management involves eradication of diseased plants, planting of
virus-free material, and heat treatment of infected tissue cultures to
provide virus-free plantlets.
