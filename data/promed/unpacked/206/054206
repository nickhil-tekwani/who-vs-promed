More cattle and buffaloes have been dying daily from haemorrhagic
septicaemia (HS) since the case was 1st detected on Friday [9 May 2008].
Farmers in the district have suffered losses of more than RM [Malaysia
Ringgits] 100 000 [USD 31 061].

The State Veterinary Department said so far, 43 animals had died and that
the most affected areas were Kampung Tasik Hulu, Kampung Gual Sitok,
Kampung Jejawi, Kampung Siram, and Kampung Tok Sangkut, all located in
Pasir Mas [map at <http://www.dromoz.com/directory/place/?id=614&p=bachok>.
- Mod.AS].

Haemorrhagic septicaemia is an infectious disease afflicting cattle and
buffalo, and it is caused by the bacteria _Pasteurella multocida_. Symptoms
include fever, appetite loss, and drooling. The affected animals also
appear stressed as if from malnutrition, exhaustion, sudden weather change
or lengthy transportation.

A district veterinary spokesman said since the cases were reported, the
department had started a vaccination exercise in the affected villages and
areas within a 5 km radius. "Five teams have been set up. This is to curb
the spread of the disease and to prevent the animals from dying." The
spokesman said the 1st cases were reported in Kampung Kedap and Kampung
Tasik. "We believed the spread of the disease was caused by the recent
sudden weather change from hot to rainy. More animals will be affected if
the weather continues like this."

There are nearly 700 animal rearers in Rantau Panjang with more than 4000
cattle and buffaloes. Abdul Rahim said the department was expected to
complete its vaccination exercise by the end of this week. Despite the rise
in the number of dead cattle, he said the situation was still under
control. "We have sent samples of the carcasses to our laboratory for
analysis and are waiting for the result," he added.
