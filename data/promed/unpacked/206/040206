Research finds urine from black flying foxes poses biggest Hendra virus risk to horses, following confirmed Hendra case in far north Queensland.

One of Australia's leading bat researchers says scientists are closer to understanding how the deadly Hendra virus spreads to horses.

The clear evidence was that (bat) urine, by far, was the most common source in which the virus was found.

Horses that came into contact with urine from black flying foxes were most likely to catch the virus, according to new research being discussed at the Wildlife Disease Association International Conference on Queensland's Sunshine Coast today [26 Jul 2015].

It has long been known that bats are the natural hosts of the Hendra virus and could pass it to horses, but exactly how that happens has been difficult to prove.

Dr Hume Field is a science and policy advisor with US conservation group EcoHealth Alliance, and the former principal scientist with the Queensland Centre for Emerging Infectious Diseases.

He said a recent study of 3000 bats from Charters Towers in north Queensland, to Sydney in New South Wales, indicated urine was the most likely link.

"The study took samples from urine, faeces, saliva, and nasal discharge and the clear evidence was that urine, by far, was the most common source in which the virus was found," Dr Field said.

"Faeces was further down the line and saliva and nasal discharge were very infrequent."

But despite urine being the most likely source of contamination, Dr Field said more information was needed to establish how horses come into contact with it.

"We want to know what behaviour in horses puts them at greater risk of exposure and knowing that virus is mostly excreted in urine gives us some insight into that," he said.

"For example, if you had a horse that was resting or grazing under a tree where flying foxes were feeding, and flying foxes urinate a lot when foraging in trees, there is the potential for that horse stranding underneath to get directly contaminated.

"It can happen through the nose, the mucus membranes of the eyes, or as well horses can ingest some urine on grass."

Dr Hume said researchers had also identified which species of flying fox were more likely to pass on the disease, and said horse owners in areas where black flying foxes were common should be most wary.

The spectacled flying fox, which is common around parts of north Queensland, is another variety thought to be more risky.

Dr Hume said the study explored 3 species; red flying foxes, black flying foxes, and grey-headed flying foxes.

He said various information over the years made scientists think that not all flying foxes were the same when it came to the Hendra virus risk they posed.

But this study into 3000 animals across 3 species offered a better understanding, he said.

"It was abundantly clear that all of the positive detections of Hendra viruses came from black flying foxes, none came from little red flying foxes, and none came from grey-headed flying foxes," he said.

"We know there are antibodies in all of those species, so they all get infected at some stage."

"But it seems that the black flying fox and the related spectacled flying fox in far north Queensland excrete most of the virus and seem to define the likelihood of Hendra virus spill-over in horses.

"We would argue that is why we see Hendra virus occurring in Queensland and the mid north coast of new South Wales, which is the southern extent of black flying foxes."

Hendra case could prompt compulsory vaccinations
------------------------------------------------
Yani Smit, the president of an equestrian club in far north Queensland said the recent Hendra horse death could lead to compulsory vaccinations at some local horse events.

Yani Smit lives at Wondecla, about 80 km [about 50 mi] away from the infected property.

The Department of Agriculture said vaccination was the best defence, and Ms Smit said while everyone should make their own choice, vaccination may be enforced in some cases.

"This subject has popped up regularly in our meetings; if we need to say that all horses need to be vaccinated if they come to events," she said. "For example, if vets don't want to come to events anymore, they [riders and organisers] may have to make a decision that they make it compulsory that all horses need to be vaccinated."

Ms Smit said a high number of horse-owners in the region had vaccinated their animals.

[How interesting that the bats have a higher virus shedding rate in their urine. The bats slobber so much when they eat fruit, and horses seek out the shade of the fruit trees, and may eat some fruit, that it was believed until now that the saliva was the most likely source of the virus.

Horses under trees continues to be a high risk situation. The bats may slobber profusely, but apparently release a fair amount of urine while eating as well. Since urine seems to be the highest virus concentrating medium, and saliva less, but lots of both are generated when the bats are in the fruit trees, that would mean that being under the trees would pose a very high risk.

Narrowing down precisely which species is also helpful in understanding why there is higher incidence of the virus in a certain region. Knowing which bats present higher risk may help people better manage their risk. However, not knowing the precise mechanism of exposure to urine is still a problematic issue.

However, it seems the bats are carriers only and not affected by the virus. - Mod.TG
