Western Australia [WA] has been hit with an unprecedented outbreak of measles, with 8 confirmed cases in Perth.

The state's health department confirmed there have been 5 cases alone in the Rockingham area, in Perth's south. One of those cases included a baby. A further 3 cases have now been confirmed across the city.

The rare outbreak has been linked to a much bigger one in New Zealand.

Health authorities believe the WA outbreak started with a New Zealand visitor, that man has since returned home.

There have been more than 1300 cases of measles in New Zealand recently.

WA health authorities are in the process of providing information to people who were potentially exposed to offer treatment and immunisations if appropriate.

But they say it's not possible to identify people who may have been exposed in public places.

Acting Director of the Communicable Disease Control Directorate, Paul Effler, said measles was a serious and highly contagious virus spread by tiny droplets released when infected people cough and sneeze.

"Every measles case is treated as a public health emergency because of the risk of local spread," Dr Effler said on [Tue 1 Oct 2019].

"With high vaccination coverage, naturally occurring measles has been eliminated from WA for around 20 years, but occasional cases and small outbreaks still occur, usually associated with tourists or Western Australia residents who are infected overseas."

Auckland health officials, in their latest update, confirmed 5 pregnant woman have caught measles and 2 of those fetuses died.

Medical officer of health Dr William Rainger said [fewer] cases were presenting each week than when it peaked at the end of August [2019].

Between 35%-40% of people with measles have been hospitalised during February to mid-September [2019] -- much higher than previous outbreaks where only about 10% of those who contract it ended up in hospital.

Between [1 Jan and 26 Sep 2019] there have been 1498 confirmed cases of measles notified across New Zealand, according to the Ministry of Health, with 1246 cases occurring in Auckland.

Double the number of people have been hospitalised with measles than usual.

Bartholomew said about half of those admitted to hospital were children. There was also a much higher number of Maori and Pacific Island people hospitalised than any other ethnicities.

[A] retrospective cohort analysis found that pregnant women with measles had significantly higher risks of adverse maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes when compared with pregnant women without measles. Over the last century, previous studies of maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications of measles during pregnancy in other settings suggest the possibility of increased risk for morbidity and mortality [2, 3, 10-16, 22, 23]. More recent studies in developed countries have found a lower incidence of maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications, which has been attributed to improved medical management of the mother and prophylactic use of immunoglobulin for the infant [3, 11, 12]. However, in many settings, including Africa, prophylactic immunoglobulin is not routinely offered to measles-exposed infants, and the clinical management of pregnancy-related complications is suboptimal. Thus, the higher rates of complications found in our study were not unexpected, and were comparable to findings from a 1997 Saudi Arabian study that reported 15% of spontaneous abortions, 5% stillbirths, 25% premature births, and 7.5% neonatal mortality among pregnant women with measles [10].

[3] CDC: measles elimination maintained
Date: October 2019

https://www.cdc.gov/measles/elimination.html


With the end of the New York state measles outbreak, the United States has maintained our measles elimination status of nearly 20 years.

While we expect importations of measles cases into the United States to continue, the risk for measles for the majority of the population would still remain low. That is because most people in the United States are vaccinated against measles.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines measles elimination as "the absence of endemic measles virus transmission in a defined geographical area (such as, region or country) for at least 12 months in the presence of a surveillance system that has been verified to be performing well." In 2000, measles was declared eliminated from the United States. That means the disease is no longer constantly present in this country. However, travelers continue to bring measles into the United States, and it can sometimes spread and cause outbreaks among people who are not vaccinated. If a measles outbreak continues for a year or more, the United States could lose its measles elimination status.

The US will continue to detect and respond to measles cases
-----------------------------------------------------------
Measles outbreaks continue to occur in countries around the world so there is always a risk of measles importations into the US.
- When measles is imported into a community with a highly vaccinated population, outbreaks either don't happen or are usually small.

The outbreaks in New York State ("Rockland County") and New York City have ended.
- The outbreaks in New York City and New York State started on 30 Sep and 1 Oct 2018, respectively. These outbreaks were associated with importations from Israel and had ongoing transmissions for almost 1 year in large, close-knit, and under-vaccinated Orthodox Jewish communities. They accounted for 75% of measles cases in the US during 2019. These outbreaks threatened the measles elimination status of the United States.
- On 3 Sep 2019, New York City declared the end of their measles outbreak, followed by the New York State Department of Health declaring the end of their outbreak on 3 Oct 2019.
- CDC has been working with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) throughout the year [2019] to keep stakeholders updated on measles surveillance. CDC will meet with PAHO's Regional Verification Commission in the coming months to review the US data and verify measles elimination status.
- CDC will continue to work with state and local partners to try to identify every case of measles and prevent measles transmission within this community and beyond. CDC will also continue to work with local partners to strengthen vaccine confidence in these communities to prevent a future recurrence of this situation.

Eliminating measles in the US was a historic achievement
--------------------------------------------------------
Achieving measles elimination status and maintaining it for 19 years was a historic public health achievement.
- Even if we lose our measles elimination status, vaccine coverage in the US remains high. Therefore, the majority of the US population remains at low risk for getting the disease.
- The best thing you can do to protect yourself and your community is to make sure you and all of your loved ones get vaccinated on time according to CDC's routine immunization schedule.
- Achieving and maintaining elimination status has been a major undertaking. It has required a significant investment of people, time, and resources. (See Measles epidemiology in the United States . J Infect Dis 2004; 189(Suppl 1): S1-90; https://academic.oup.com/jid/issue/189/Supplement_1 and Elimination of endemic measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome from the western hemisphere . JAMA Pediatr. 2014; 168(2): 148-155; https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/1787786). Reestablishing elimination status would take time and resources.
- However, there won't be any economic, political, or practical penalties for losing elimination. Losing measles elimination would have no adverse implications for the immunization program, its funding, or access of America's children to vaccination either in the private sector or through the federally funded Vaccines for Children Program.

[The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention said [on Fri 4 Oct 2019] the number of states reporting sick individuals stands at 31. The CDC confirms a total of 1249 cases of measles for the year.

An outbreak is considered 3 or more cases during a period of time in one location. Overall, there have been 22 separate measles outbreaks in 17 states (https://www.wtvm.com/2019/10/05/centers-disease-control-prevention-confirms-highest-number-measles-cases-since/). - Mod.LK

The Putnam County Department of Health has confirmed a case of measles.

Several possible exposure sites have been identified [see source URL above for list of possible locations/times of exposure.]

The patient has been isolated to avoid spreading the disease further.

This has been the worst year for measles across the United States since 1992, according to the Centers for Disease Control. As of 26 Sep 2019, the CDC reported 1243 cases of measles confirmed in 31 states.

More than 75% of the cases this year are linked to outbreaks in New York.

Measles is more likely to spread and cause outbreaks in U.S. communities where groups of people are unvaccinated.

Measles can cause serious complications. As of 26 Sep 2019, 131 of the people who got measles this year were hospitalized, and 65 reported having complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis.

These outbreaks are linked to travelers who brought measles back from other countries such as Israel, Ukraine, and the Philippines, where large measles outbreaks are occurring.

The longest running outbreak in the US was in neighboring Rockland County (which started in October 2018). It was declared over last week [week of 23 Sep 2019], as the date of completion of 2 maximum incubation periods (42 days) without cases approached 30 Sep 2019.

With the end of the New York state measles outbreak, "the United States anticipates maintaining its measles elimination status," a statement from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on [Thu 3 Oct 2019].

There are no longer any active measles cases in New York state associated with the outbreak that began in October 2018, the New York State Department of Health said [Thu 3 Oct 2019]. More than 42 days have passed without any new measles cases in New York's Sullivan and Orange counties, the statement said, and outbreaks in Rockland County and New York City also ended recently.

"The threat, however, for vaccine-preventable diseases remains and the Department is not letting down its guard," New York state Health Commissioner Dr Howard Zucker said in a statement Thursday, adding that there are responses underway in Nassau, Monroe, and Putnam counties, which have measles exposures related to international travel.

Measles has returned to New Jersey, with a case confirmed at an Essex County elementary school.

The recent outbreak in New Jersey, with a total of 19 confirmed cases dating back to October 2018, was mostly in Lakewood and was considered by the state Department of Health to be over as of 16 May 2019. The department's website reported a new case was confirmed on [Tue 1 Oct 2019], but did not disclose a location.

It is the 1st confirmed case since mid-July [2019], according to the agency. "The source of this infection is currently unknown," it wrote.

An email sent by Nutley School Superintendent Dr Julie Glazer to parents on [Thu 3 Oct 2019] said the case at the Washington Elementary School was confirmed by the Nutley Department of Health, according to NorthJersey.com.

In the email, Glazer said the school was thoroughly cleaned by the school's custodial staff.

Public Health England (PHE) and the local council announced a suspected measles outbreak in Southend-on-Sea, in Essex, England, involving 8 people who attend local day services for people with learning disabilities.

This facility has been closed for the remainder of this week, said PHE as of 2 Oct 2019.

Furthermore, approximately 200 additional individuals may be involved.

Southend-on-Sea Borough Council (SSBC) is in direct liaison with specialist health protection clinicians at PHE who are managing the suspected outbreak.

Southend-on-Sea in Essex is located about 45 miles [about 72.5 km] east of London, where various measles outbreaks have been reported during 2019, such as [Hackney and Haringey, the north London, England areas with the largest Orthodox populations.]

As an immediate priority, PHE and SSBC are identifying and contacting those people who may have been directly exposed and are offering those people measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccinations if they are not already immunized.
