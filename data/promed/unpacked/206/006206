Outbreaks of Newcastle disease virus at farms west of Sydney have prompted
the start of slaughter of 100 000 chickens, New South Wales State
Agriculture spokesman, Col. Begg announced. The strain of the virus has been
described as "the highly virulent form".
Farms adjacent to confirmed outbreak locations will be tested to see if the
disease has already spread and a cordon sanitaire [= pre-emptive slaughter
will include all suspected or potentially infected sites. The young chickens
will be killed over the next five days and their corpses, litter and eggs
buried in a plastic-lined pit.

An Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service spokesman said that although
there is a potential for the outbreak to impact poultry exports in a major
way, neither the two confirmed properties nor other farms in the quarantined
area are involved in exporting chicken products.
In the wake of the outbreak some importers of Australian poultry products
were expected to demand certification to prove their purchases came from
outside the affected area, the spokesman said.

The discovery of a unique [? strain of a highly contagious virus forced the
culling of more than 50 000 chickens on two Sydney farms last night. NSW
Agriculture has advised bird owners to be aware of the symptoms of Newcastle
disease after tests showed an outbreak of "high virulence" -- the most
dangerous classification for the disease. About 42 000 chickens had died
from the virus in the two farms before the remaining 50 000 birds were
gassed last night.
After losing the livestock, the owners of the farms in the northwestern
suburbs of Colebee and Glenorie will be compensated under a scheme funded by
the Commonwealth and States.
The executive director of the Australian Chicken Meat Federation (ACMF), Dr
Jeff Fairbrother, said the disease had been transferred by employees
delivering eggs last week. "It's a strange strain that we've never seen
before. It's unique," he said. Infected birds collapse and die after
suffering respiratory problems, diarrhoea and swelling of the head. The new
Sydney strain also induces twitching and nervous symptoms.
The ACMF was confident the outbreak - the first dangerous strain in
Australia since 1932 - had not spread beyond the two farms. But it will be
four weeks before further contamination can be ruled out. "If it had spread
rapidly, we would have seen it by now," Dr Fairbrother said.
It remains to be seen how the outbreak will affect the State's $800 million
poultry industry. "Our exports can go almost anywhere in the world ... if it
is the virulent Newcastle disease, our exports would be banned in certain
trade areas," a NSW agriculture spokesman said. Until the outbreak emerged,
Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea had been the only nations free
from virulent strains of Newcastle disease.
Col. Begg of NSW Agriculture said the most likely source was a
migrating bird and the disease put all species of bird, native and
introduced, at risk. "We advise people to be aware of the hygiene of
all chicken pens and bird aviaries," Mr Begg said.
[It seems that Fairbrother and Begg should coordinate their differing
versions as to the cause of this outbreak. I think we can assume that
poultry exports from Australia will undergo severe prohibitions,
involving contiguous states and possibly the whole country, unless this
outbreak is successfully & rapidly controlled.
Until the virus has been typed it is a bit early to claim it as a
"unique" NVVDv, and if one hasn't had to deal with such an outbreak
before, it can be daunting how vicious it can be. mod MHJ
