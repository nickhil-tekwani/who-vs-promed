Researchers at Texas Tech University's Institute of Environmental and
Human Health warned area farmers, ranchers, and hunters Monday [24 Jan
2011] to use caution when handling wild game after finding evidence of
the bacterium that causes tularemia in feral hogs in Bell and Coryell
[and Crosby -- see next para.] Counties [in Texas].

Tularemia is a serious infectious disease caused by the bacteria
_Francisella tularensis_, said Steve Presley, a zoonotic disease
researcher who leads the team that tested about 130 feral hogs from
Bell, Coryell, and Crosby counties [in Texas]. Rodents and wild game
animals as well as mosquitoes, deer flies, and ticks, can carry
tularemia, which is commonly known as rabbit fever, he said. 15
percent of the feral hogs from the 2 Central Texas counties and 50
percent of those from Crosby County showed evidence of current or past
infection, he said.

"We have found high levels of antibodies in these pigs that show they
have been infected with _Francisella tularensis_ and found that some
of these pigs were actively infected with it," Presley said. "The
bacteria are constantly present in animals in this area and in the
feral hog population, but normally it's only a small number of cases.
This is a huge number of infected animals."

What the researchers have yet to determine is the subspecies of
bacteria infecting the hogs. The type B subspecies can cause illness
in wildlife, domestic animals, and humans, but poses a less serious
health threat to humans, Presley said. But the type A subspecies can
be lethal to humans, he said, and the US Centers For Disease Control
and Prevention [CDC] considers it a viable bio-weapons agent.

Regardless of which type it turns out to be, Presley says anyone who
may come into contact with wild animals -- especially those that might
hunt or eat wild hogs -- should be cautious. "If you are handling,
cleaning, or eating wild game, particularly hogs, deer, or rabbits,
you should be wearing rubber gloves and eye protection when you're
dressing wild game," he said. "The bacteria can enter any sort of
small cut or hangnail. During this time of year, it might not be as
big of an issue, but you should check yourself for ticks, wear tick
repellent, and avoid biting flies, including mosquitoes." Presley also
recommends making sure game meats are thoroughly cooked before eating
them and says homeowners and lawn care professionals should look for
wild rabbit nests hidden in tall grasses prior to mowing. [There was a
case in Washington of a man running over an infected rabbit while
mowing his grass and getting exposure, presumably from inhalation of
aerosolized carcass -- see ProMED 2005 archive below. - Mod.PC]

The discovery was made while the researchers were looking for
brucellosis. They found no evidence of that disease, and were
surprised to find evidence of tularemia, said Brad Dabbert, associate
chairman of Texas Tech's Department of Natural Resources Management.
"Traditionally, it's a rabbit disease, but it does get reported in
birds and other mammals," Dabbert said. "Since hogs can range over
large areas, it's certainly possible that they can transport this
stuff. That's kind of the critical issue now. The other thing we're
trying to do is look for it in other animals now to more accurately
answer that question," he said.

Between 2000 and 2008, only 8 human cases of tularemia were reported
in the state and about 125 are reported each year in the USA, Texas
Tech said Monday [24 Jan 2011]. Texas AgriLife Extension Service says
feral hogs can be found in 230 of Texas' 254 counties and cause annual
damage of nearly USD 400 million.

[Tularemia, also known as rabbit fever and deerfly fever, is a
bacterial zoonosis caused by the Gram negative coccobacillus
_Francisella tularensis_. The organism can infect humans and more than
300 species of domestic and wild animals, including 25 species of
birds and several species of amphibians and reptiles. Water can also
become contaminated from animals infected with tularemia and cause
human infections. In 1982, 49 cases of oropharyngeal tularemia were
identified in Italy. The case distribution suggested the individuals
had consumed unchlorinated water in which a dead rabbit with _F.
tularensis_ was found. Another waterborne transmission of tularemia
occurred in 1998 on 19 persons in contact with river-caught crayfish
in Spain.

Wild mammals are the primary hosts of _F. tularensis_, especially
species within the orders Lagomorpha [rabbits], Rodentia [rats and
mice], and Sciuromorpha [squirrels]. Sheep are the domestic mammal
most commonly associated with tularemia, but within recent years
domestic cats have become an increasing source for human cases of this
disease. In swine, infections are primarily in young animals, due to
bites from infected ticks and from eating infected rodents. It is
generally accepted that ticks are of major importance in maintaining
the enzootic foci of tularemia.

Infections in humans are not contagious and most often result from
contact with infected wildlife, ingestion of, or contact with
contaminated water, or bites from ticks and other arthropods that have
fed on infected wildlife. The disease in humans is nationally
notifiable in the United States and has been reported in every state
except Hawaii. Type A tularemia infection in humans is a moderately
severe disease that follows a well-described course leading to the
development of one of several clinical syndromes dependent on the
route of exposure, dose, and virulence of the infecting organism.
Prior to the use of antibiotics for the treatment of tularemia,
infection resulted in death in 5 to 15 percent of the cases within
North America; this has fallen to 1 to 3 percent during recent years
and now averages less than 2 percent. However, untreated cases of
tularemia that progress to systemic infections may result in severe
disease with high rates of fatality. Outside of the USA, human deaths
rarely exceed one percent because of the less virulent forms of _F.
tularensis_ present. Immunity following clinical disease is usually
lifelong.

Portions of the information above on tularemia in wildlife were
extracted from the excellent USGS Circular 1297 Tularemia book, which
subscribers are suggested to consult for further details
(<http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/publications/tularemia/>).

Feral hogs (_Sus scrofa_) are an Old World species belonging to the
family Suidae. They were probably introduced by Spanish explorers 300
years ago as a source of meat and were later crossbred with European
wild boar introduced as game animals in the 1930's. Feral hogs are
omnivorous, capable of eating both plant and animal matter as
opportunity changes through the seasons. Food includes grasses,
flowering plants, roots and tubers, browse, mast [tree fruit such as
acorns], fruits, bulbs and mushrooms. Animal matter includes
invertebrates (insects, snails, earthworms, etc.), reptiles,
amphibians, and carrion, as well as live mammals and birds if given
the opportunity. This varied feeding habit and diet makes the feral
hogs susceptible to inhalation of _F. tularensis_ in the environment
from digging and browsing the grounds around infected animals and
particularly direct ingestion of carrion infected with tularemia.

Feral hogs are prolific breeders, with sows reaching sexual maturity
at 7 or 8 months, normally bearing litters of 4-5 young, twice per
year. The feral hog population in Texas has been increasing
dramatically due to many factors including intentional releases,
improved habitat, increased wildlife management, and improved animal
husbandry such as disease eradication, limited natural predators, and
high reproductive potential. The current population of feral hogs in
Texas is estimated to be over 2 million, which is approximately half
of the total US population of the animal. Feral hogs are unprotected,
exotic, non-game animals. They can be hunted by any means or methods
at any time of year without season or bag limits, however a hunting
license and landowner permission are required.

Portions of the information above about feral hogs was extracted from
the Texas Parks and Wildlife website at
<http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/wild/nuisance/feral_hogs/>

This news report states that 15 percent of the examined feral hogs
from Bell and Coryell counties and 50 percent from Crosby County show
antibodies to tularemia, but no exact numbers are given for currently
seroactive cases. We hope the researchers will be able to continue the
research to confirm the serotype and seroactive numbers to get a
better understanding of the epidemiological model and future trends.

As hunting requires being in close contact and possibly butchering and
consumption of feral hogs with tularemia, public awareness and
educational programs for hunters should be of concern. As tularemia is
a treatable disease, educational programs should also include
information on symptoms and diagnosis so the general public living in
areas with feral hogs will understand and get immediate proper medical
treatment for tularemia.
