Leishmaniasis, northern Nicaragua
-------------------------------------
A leishmaniasis outbreak has attacked 667 people in Northern Nicaragua. The
Nicaraguan Ministry of Health reported last Wednesday [25 May 2005] that
667 rural workers became infected with leishmaniasis, a disease known as
"mountain leprosy" [presumable cutaneous leishmaniasis], in communities in
the Northern part of the country.
"We observed that cases increased, particularly in children. This is why we
sent health care teams to assist sick people and to perform laboratory
tests in order to detect how many people are affected," said Margarita
Gurdian, Nicaragua Minister of Health.
The infection has spread to 13 communities in Cua County, Jinotega
Department, 162 km (100 miles) north of the Capital City, where the
Ministry of Health sent a health care team in order to supply medicines and
assist sick people. Most patients are less than 15 years old. The most
affected community is El Galope, with a total number of 332 rural workers
affected with leishmaniasis, a disease transmitted by the bite of a
mosquito called _Phlebotomus_, which causes skin ulceration and
destruction. The mosquito usually reproduces during the rainy season in the
Jinotega region, particularly in Cua county, where 233 cases of
leishmaniasis were reported last year [2004].

[Cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic in Central America. Several strains of
Leishmania [_L. braziliensis_, _L. panamensis_ and _L. infantum_ (_L.
chagasi_)] have been identified by molecular typing (Zeledon et al. Arch
Inst Pasteur Tunis. 1993;70:325-9; Convit et al. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg.
2005;99:13-7). - Mod.EP]
