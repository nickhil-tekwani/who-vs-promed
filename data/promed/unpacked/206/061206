A mare or mares imported from North America to Victoria are believed to be
at the center of the latest outbreaks of the equine herpesvirus or equine
rhinopneumonitis virus (EHV-1) in Australia.
As the Australian thoroughbred breeding season officially got under way on
1 Sep 2002, at least a dozen farms were quarantined. Most are in Victoria
but several in New South Wales (NSW) have also been isolated.
At the latest count there are 30 confirmed cases of mares aborting foals in
the later stages of pregnancy. Infected mares can abort within 5 months
after conception, but the majority of cases occur from the 8th to the 11th
month. The NSW incidents are believed to have occurred after the movement
of mares from Victoria amid the general flurry of activity in July 2002.
Breeding authorities hope the spread has been contained by the 30-day
quarantining and the awareness of breeders, which has resulted in a vast
reduction in the movement of pregnant mares.
Thoroughbred Breeders Australia (TBA) has recommended that wherever
possible, owners keep foaling mares at home and move them and the foal
later. TBA president Richard Turley suggests the increased incidence could
be due in part to a more responsible reportage by breeders in the wake of
protocols put in place after the 1989 outbreak.
Professor Michael Studdert of the University of Melbourne's school of
veterinary science described the EHV outbreak as the worst seen in
Australia. There have been viral abortion epidemics of similar scope in
1989, 1994, and 2000 but with fewer farms affected, particularly in 1994
and 2000.
Professor Studdert and his university team developed an EHV-1 vaccine in
1996. He rates the vaccine, developed from a killed virus, as effective in
80 per cent of cases. No commercially available treatment can provide total
protection. Foals and yearlings can develop the respiratory form of the
[disease produced by equine] herpesvirus. Older horses can become infected
but are more likely to be carriers and not show any signs of the disease.
The signs are mild fever, coughing, and a nasal discharge. The virus
remains dormant in the system of and can be activated in a mare with a
"viral awakening" after she begins breeding. She could also lose her fetus
anywhere within 7 months or as early as 2 weeks after contracting the virus.
The EVH outbreaks played in the background as Australia had its first brush
with the West Nile Virus. Canadian standardbred pacer Astreos was believed
to have been infected by mosquito bite before being transported to
Australia. He displayed signs associated with the disease 5 days after his
arrival at the Eastern Creek Quarantine Center, west of Sydney. Samples
subsequently sent to the Canadian Department of Agriculture laboratories
and Australia's main Animal Heath Laboratory at Geelong confirmed the
presence of WNV. As the Little Brown Jug winner had recovered and the virus
is non-transferable, except by _Culex_ spp mosquitoes, he and almost 50
thoroughbred shuttle stallions were released 30 Aug 2002.
