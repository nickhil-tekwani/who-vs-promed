If the trend continues in cases of human brucellosis in the state of Jalisco from the consumption of [unpasteurized] products derived from infected cattle, it will exceed that of 2011, as reported by the holder of the Secretariat of Health Jalisco (SJS), Antonio Munoz Serrano, after which the health unit recognized 142 cases so far in 2012, of which 89 are women and 53 men, a fact that contrasts with the cases registered in 2011, which to this date had 87 cases and closed with 187.

Of the 4 reported cases in the Civil Hospital, he explained that "it is not uncommon to find patients with brucellosis, especially in rural regions where dairy products such as cheese or the milk of goats carry this disease."

Munoz Serrano urged the public to avoid the consumption of foods derived from unpasteurized milk, such as those often found in flea markets, and also to buy from establishments that offer cheeses and creams of quality.

[Brucellosis is a disease that is thought to have existed since ancient times, as it was 1st described more than 2000 years ago by the Romans and Hippocrates. It was not until 1887 that a British physician, Dr David Bruce, isolated the organism that causes brucellosis from several deceased patients from the island of Malta. This disease has had several names throughout its history, including Mediterranean fever, Malta fever, Crimean fever, Bang's disease, and undulant fever (because of the relapsing nature of the fever associated with the disease). See: http://www.medicinenet.com/brucellosis/article.htm.

The symptoms and signs of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may develop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic symptoms.

The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive, and they can be similar to many other febrile illnesses, so recognition of potential exposure from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, working in a slaughter house or meat processing plant, or working in a microbiology lab is vital. - Mod.LL]
