The Ministry of Health, Bangladesh, has confirmed its 1st case of
human infection with H5N1 avian influenza. The case was identified
retrospectively as part of seasonal surveillance activities run by
the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh
(ICDDRB).

The case is a 16-month-old male from Komalapur, Dhaka. He developed
symptoms on Sun 27 Jan 2008 and subsequently recovered. The case was
confirmed as being infected with A(H5N1) by the WHO H5 Reference
Laboratory, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The
case was exposed to live and slaughtered chickens at his home.
Specimens have been collected from his family members and neighbours.
All remain healthy to date.

[This is the official WHO confirmation of the 1st case of human avian
H5N1 influenza virus infection in Bangladesh, as reported previously
in ProMED-mail (see: Avian influenza, human (49): Bangladesh, WHO
20080525.1718). This new statement on the WHO website now provides an
explanation for the delay in confirming this human case of H5N1 avian
influenza contracted in late January 2008.

Bangladesh has become the 15th country to report human avian H5N1
virus infection. The other 14 countries are: Azerbaijan (8 cases, 5
deaths), Cambodia (7 cases, 7 deaths), China (30 cases, 20 deaths),
Djibouti (one case, no deaths), Egypt (50 cases, 22 deaths),
Indonesia (133 cases, 108 deaths), Iraq (3 cases, 2 deaths), Lao
People's Democratic Republic (2 cases, 2 deaths), Myanmar (one case,
no deaths), Nigeria (one case, one death), Pakistan (3 cases, one
death), Thailand (25 cases, 17 deaths), Turkey (12 cases, 4 deaths),
and Viet Nam (106 cases, 52 deaths). The global figure now becomes
383 cases and 241 deaths. A full breakdown of the figures can be
obtained at:
