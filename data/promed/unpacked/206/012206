Coccidioidomycosis - Arizona, possible risk behaviour
--------------------------------------------
As a resident of the northern outlying region of Phoenix near Cave Creek, I
would like to point out that one factor not included in the study of risk
factors associated with the increased incidence of Coccidioidomycosis is
the ORV factor.
The Off Road Vehicle use in the outlying areas of Maricopa County around
Phoenix varies from high to extremely high (daily), and the number of ORVs
has increased substantially from 1998 to the present. Coincidentally, these
vehicles are used almost exclusively during the winter months due to the
high summer temperatures. Most of the roads in the outlying regions are
unpaved, and the ORVs use these to reach the open desert areas, where great
clouds of dust can be seen for miles as they churn up the soil and spew it
into the air for hours at a time. Neighbors are outraged, as these vehicles
are not only destroying the fragile ecosystem of the desert with their
extreme noise and pollution, but it would appear they are also threatening
the health of those neighbors unfortunate enough to live near the
high-traffic desert areas frequented by these ORV users.

[Interesting how a change in human behavior could be an explanation for the
increase in Coccidioidomycosis in arid desert areas. This factor should
definitely be included in future studies of exposure to dust. - Mod.EP]
