Bird deaths probed; Sudden death of dozens of birds in North Stafford
prompts investigation
Dozens found at Stafford sites
-----------------------
The state Department of Game and Inland Fisheries is investigating the
deaths of more than 100 birds found yesterday in North Stafford County.
About 3 dozen were found at the Stafford Pointe commercial complex on
Garrisonville Road early yesterday. Another 68 were collected later at
Aquia Towne Center, about 2 miles away.
Employees at USA Barber Shop in Stafford Pointe discovered the dead birds
when they arrived for work. About half a dozen lay beneath a large tree
where they were known to roost; the rest were scattered across the parking lot.
Employees in the barber shop first contacted the local Health Department
out of concern for their safety. None of the birds -- believed to be
sparrows -- showed obvious signs of injury such as being shot.
Suzanne Jenkins, an epidemiologist with the Virginia Department of Health
in Richmond, said she sees little public health risk and doubts the birds
died of West Nile virus. "When there are large numbers of birds, it's
often due to pesticide poisoning," Jenkins said.
The game department is investigating because of the number of birds, said
Lt. Paul Atkins, who works out of the agency's Fredericksburg office. "We
really don't know what it is at this point, but that's a lot of birds in a
short time," Atkins said.
4 birds were picked up from Stafford Pointe yesterday afternoon and taken
to a lab in Warrenton for testing, Atkins said. It could be a week before
results are available.
A game warden was sent back to North Stafford after Atkins learned about
the birds at Aquia Towne Center. The lab had closed by the time she
collected them and she was unsure whether any of those would be tested.
Atkins doesn't suspect disease killed the birds because they were alive one
day and dead the next. He said the most likely causes are the pesticide
poisoning Jenkins mentioned or the severe thunderstorms that passed through
North Stafford Tuesday night.
The National Weather Service issued a tornado warning for Stafford County
from 8:29 p.m. to 9:15 p.m. Tuesday. Warnings are issued when someone has
spotted a tornado or one is indicated by radar.
While there was no evidence yesterday that a tornado had touched
down, meteorologist Luis Rosa said there were reports of nickel-size hail
in Aquia.
Stafford fire, rescue and communications officials reported heavy storms,
high winds, high water, and several lightning strikes. One bolt hit a
utility pole and a transformer about 2 blocks from Stafford Pointe.

[These birds may have died from the storm, or from hail associated with the
storm. It is also possible that it is a toxin. If the birds were being
nuisance, then some well meaning citizen may have tried to rid the area
with toxin-laden grain baits. When there is an authoritative report
available, ProMED-mail would welcome the information. - Mod.TG]
