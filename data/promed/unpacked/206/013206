Environment Canada says a highly pathogenic avian influenza first identified on a farm on the Avalon Peninsula has been found in birds around the St John's area. In a statement from the City of St. John's on Friday [31 Dec 2021], officials said Environment Canada had confirmed that influenza H5N1 has been found in wild birds in areas like Bowring Park, Quidi Vidi Lake, and other areas frequented by flocks of birds.

"Like our human flu, it has variants we refer to as highly pathogenic, meaning that they cause illness and death in birds getting infected with them," said Ian Jones, a biology professor at Memorial University.

The city has asked residents not to feed, touch, or handle wild birds, including ducks, pigeons, and gulls.

Cases of H5N1 were first identified on the island around mid-December [2021] on an exhibition farm on the island, according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and a report from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Jones said the flu circulates naturally in birds, with higher case numbers in Europe signalling a higher risk for North American poultry flocks this year [2021-2022]. The disease is often found in birds such as chickens, turkeys, quails, and guinea fowl, as well as pet and wild birds.

Jones suspects the flu could have come from Europe in recent months, as some species of geese not usually seen in North America have been found in the province following an October [2021] windstorm. "It was a major system filling almost the entire North Atlantic, producing very strong winds from northern Europe straight across and then down to Newfoundland, including the Avalon Peninsula. Migrating waterfowl, especially geese from Europe, were caught up in this," he said.

"Birdwatchers have observed in eastern Canada an unprecedented number of barnacle geese and pink-footed geese, 2 European geese species which don't normally occur here." Jones said the risk of humans getting the disease is low, and it would involve dealing with the insides of infected animals. The biggest risk, Jones said, comes in agriculture and the poultry industry.

The exhibition farm where the disease was first identified doesn't produce birds for sale, the agency said, adding it won't have an effect on poultry trade. The farm was under quarantine, which included a 10 km [6.2 mi] zone with movement control measures and enhanced biosecurity to limit the potential spread of the disease.

According to the OIE, 419 birds were identified to be carrying the flu. Of those, 360 died, while 59 had to be euthanized.

In a statement to CBC News earlier this month [December 2021], Country Ribbon -- the province's largest poultry producer -- said production wouldn't be affected, and strict monitoring was taking place to ensure safety at their farms.

A biologist in Newfoundland and Labrador says the discovery of the highly pathogenic avian flu in St John's birds is "very concerning" for bird populations, but likely not for humans. Memorial University professor Andrew Lang said in an interview on Friday [31 Dec 2021] the flu could be devastating for North America's wild bird populations if it manages to spread beyond the island of Newfoundland.

The City of St John's said in a news release Friday [31 Dec 2021] the flu had been found in local wild birds and officials asked residents not to feed, handle, or touch any birds, including gulls, ducks, and pigeons. Environment Canada wildlife scientist Alan Hanson said in an interview Friday [31 Dec 2021] the flu was found in a great black-backed gull found at a St John's pond on 26 Nov [2021].

The news comes just days after an outbreak of H5N1 avian flu was reported at an "exhibition farm" on Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula, which killed 360 of the facility's 419 birds.

Lang says there is "little or no evidence" the strain poses a risk for humans, noting it has shown up in several other parts of the world, such as Israel, where an outbreak recently killed more than 5000 migratory cranes. Lang said the current strain is particularly well adapted to spread among wild birds, as it kills many but leaves some alive. Those infected birds can then go on to spread the virus. He said it's hard to predict what will happen in Newfoundland. "Best case scenario? Maybe it never leaves the island," he said. "Maybe it'll just vanish; maybe we'll be lucky."

As for the infected gull, Hanson said it was collected at Mundy Pond, in the western part of the capital, and it was brought to wildlife officials because it was behaving strangely. The bird died about 24 hours after it was brought in, he said.

[The arrival of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is a serious situation. We are saddened to learn of the storm, and the likely transport of this disease. Certainly, we hope this disease is quickly contained and does not spread.

"AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: the hemagglutinin, or H proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase, or N proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many strains of avian influenza (AI) virus exist worldwide. These viruses affect chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks, geese, and guinea fowl as well as a wide variety of free-flying species. Migratory waterfowl have been shown to be a natural reservoir for AI. AI strains also are divided into 2 groups based upon the ability of the virus to produce disease.

"Low pathogenicity or "low path" avian influenza (LPAI)
LPAI occurs naturally in wild birds and can spread to domestic birds. In most cases it causes no signs of infection or only minor symptoms in birds. These strains of the disease pose little significant threat to human health. These strains are common in the US and around the world.

"Highly pathogenicity or 'high path' avian influenza (HPAI)
HPAI is often fatal in chickens and turkeys. HPAI spreads rapidly and has a higher death rate in birds than LPAI. HPAI has been detected and eradicated 3 times in US domestic poultry. HPAI H5N1 is the subtype rapidly spreading in some parts of the world. Most of the highly pathogenic AI viruses fall under types H5 or H7; however, most AI infections, including those typed as H5 or H7, are clinically of low pathogenicity. These typically produce few or no clinical signs in affected birds. Sometimes the only evidence of this virus is a minor increase in bird mortality. Aside from the possible mutation of low-pathogenicity strains under field conditions into high-pathogenicity strains, the presence of low-pathogenicity virus can also result in restrictions on exports and serious repercussions on the production economy. Avian influenza of H5 and H7 subtypes are known as notifiable avian influenza (NAI). APHIS works to keep NAI from becoming established in US poultry populations.

"Identifying infected birds
Birds infected with the HPAI virus may show one or more of the following signs:
- sudden death without clinical signs;
- lack of energy and appetite;
- decreased egg production or soft-shelled or misshapen eggs;
- swelling of head, comb, eyelid, wattles, and hocks;
- purple discoloration of wattles, comb, and legs;
- nasal discharge, coughing, and sneezing;
- incoordination; or
- diarrhea.

"Epidemiology
HPAI can strike poultry quickly and spread rapidly from premises to premises. Migratory waterfowl can introduce the disease to US poultry. International visitors or smuggled birds are also risk factors. Once introduced, the disease spreads from bird to bird by direct contact or through contact with contaminated manure, equipment, vehicles, crates, and the clothing or shoes of individuals who have come in contact with the virus. The virus remains viable in the environment for long periods, particularly at lower temperatures, and it can survive indefinitely in frozen material.

"Biosecurity measures on the farm
Veterinarians should work with poultry producers to strengthen biosecurity practices. Established and enforced biosecurity protocols will help prevent introduction of HPAI and other infectious agents. Recommended biosecurity measures include
- establishing an 'all-in, all-out' flock-management policy;
- protecting against exposure to wild birds or water or ground contaminated by wild birds;
- closing bird areas to nonessential personnel or vehicles;
- providing employees with clean clothing and disinfection facilities and directions for their use;
- thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting equipment and vehicles (including tires and undercarriage) when entering or leaving the farm;
- banning the borrowing or lending of equipment or vehicles;
- banning visits to other poultry farms, exhibitions, fairs, and sales or swap meets (if visits must occur, direct workers to change footwear and clothing on their return); and
- banning bringing birds in slaughter channels back to the farm.

"Reporting suspicious diseases
Practitioners are encouraged to educate their poultry clientele and pet bird owners to report all signs of disease. If signs of disease resemble AI or cannot be diagnosed, they should immediately be reported to both the assistant district director and the state animal health official."(https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/nvap/NVAP-Reference-Guide/Poultry/Avian-Influenza) - Mod.TG
