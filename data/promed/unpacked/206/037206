China (Hong Kong SAR): Scientists identify deadly gene in H5N1
-----------------------------------------------
Chinese scientists have identified a gene in the H5N1 bird flu virus
which they say is responsible for its virulence in poultry, opening
the way for new vaccines.
There are many different strains of H5N1, some of which kill more
than half the people they infect, while others do little or no harm.
"We cannot understand how this virus becomes lethal and the molecular
basis for its pathogenicity," Bu Zhigao at the Harbin Veterinary
Research Institute told Reuters.
The Chinese researchers zeroed in on the virulent gene after
analyzing 2 closely related strains of H5N1 obtained from infected
geese in southern Guangdong province in 1996, one highly pathogenic
in chickens and the other harmless. Differences between the 2 strains
were located in 4 genes, they found.
The scientists designed 4 genetically modified viruses, each
containing one of the 4 genes in question, and tested them on
laboratory chickens. Only chickens infected with the modified virus
containing the highly pathogenic gene died. The other chickens had no
signs of disease, the scientists wrote in the November [2006] issue
of the Journal of Virology.
"Now that we know the special role of the (highly pathogenic) NS1
gene, we can think about developing a vaccine," Bu said, adding that
a vaccine which neutralizes the gene known as NS1 could be quickly
designed. "Technically, that can happen very soon, but it is the
tests and other procedures that will take a long time."
The scientists are from the Ministry of Agriculture's Animal
Influenza Laboratory, the National Key Laboratory of Veterinary
Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and the
Harbin Veterinary Research Institute.

[The research paper which is the subject of the above report is
published in the November [2006] issue of the Journal of Virology,
Vol. 8, No. 22, pp 11115-11123, 2006
<http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/80/22/11115>.
The paper is entitled: "The NS1 Gene Contributes to the Virulence of
H5N1 Avian Influenza Viruses," and the authors are Zejun Li and 9 others.
The Abstract of the paper states the following:
"In the present study, we explored the genetic basis underlying the
virulence and host range of 2 H5N1 influenza viruses in chickens.
A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 (GS/GD/1/96) is a highly pathogenic virus for
chickens, whereas A/goose/Guangdong/ 2/96 (GS/GD/2/96) is unable to
replicate in chickens. These 2 H5N1 viruses differ in sequence by
only 5 amino acids mapping to the PA, NP, M1, and NS1 genes. We used
reverse genetics to create 4 single-gene recombinants that contained
one of the sequence-differing genes from nonpathogenic GS/GD/2/96 and
the remaining 7 gene segments from highly pathogenic GS/GD/1/96. We
determined that the NS1 gene of GS/GD/2/96 inhibited the replication
of GS/GD/1/96 in chickens, while the substitution of the PA, NP, or M
gene did not change the highly pathogenic properties of GS/GD/1/96.
Conversely, of the recombinant viruses generated in the GS/GD/2/96
background, only the virus containing the NS1 gene of GS/GD/1/96 was
able to replicate and cause disease and death in chickens. The
single-amino-acid difference in the sequence of these 2 NS1 genes
resides at position 149. We demonstrate that a recombinant virus
expressing the GS/GD/1/96 NS1 protein with Ala149 is able to
antagonize the induction of interferon protein levels in chicken
embryo fibroblasts (CEFs), but a recombinant virus carrying a Val149
substitution is not capable of the same effect. These results
indicate that the NS1 gene is critical for the pathogenicity of avian
influenza virus in chickens and that the amino acid residue Ala149
correlates with the ability of these viruses to antagonize interferon
induction in CEFs."
This is a significant piece of research indicating that a single
amino acid substitution in the NS1 protein of H5N1 avian influenza
virus disables the interferon response in infected chickens, a factor
contributing to the pathogenicity of the virus. This observation does
not necessarily confer enhanced vaccine potential, and significantly,
the abstract does not claim this.
In another paper in the same issue of the Journal of Virology,
however, Richt et al. (p. 11009-11018
<http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/80/22/11009>)
demonstrate the efficacy of an NS1-truncated, live-attenuated
influenza vaccine in pigs. The modified live-virus (MLV) vaccine
completely protected against homologous and partially protected
against heterosubtypic virus challenge. Importantly, MLV-vaccinated
pigs can be differentiated from naturally infected animals. These
results suggest that NS1-truncated MLV vaccines represent a new
generation of swine influenza vaccines with great potential for use
in other hosts, such as horses, dogs, birds, and humans. - Mod.CP]
