Thirthahalli taluk [sub-district, Shimoga district, Karnataka] continues to remain in the grip of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, as 4 positive cases among humans have been reported here in the past 5 days. With this, the total number of KFD positive cases reported in the taluk in 2017 has raised to 48. 4 persons have succumbed to the disease here during the same period.

All the fresh positive cases have been reported from Kudumallige Grama Panchayat limits that includes 2 cases from Kudige village and one case each from Chiduva and Heggarugudda village [Thirthahalli sub-district]. SK Kiran, Taluk Health Officer of Tirthahalli, told The Hindu that the patients were treated at the Government JC Hospital in Tirthahalli town. Of the 4 persons, 3 have recovered completely and were discharged from the hospital on [Tue 28 Mar 2017]. One patient, who was suffering from age-related illness along with KFD, has been admitted to a private hospital in Manipal for additional treatment, he said.

KFD is a tick-borne viral infection that transmits from monkeys to humans through tick bite. Meanwhile, the death of 4 monkeys in Hosanagar taluk [Shimoga district, Karnataka] on [25 Mar 2017] has triggered panic among the residents there on the possibilities of a KFD outbreak. 2 monkeys have died in a plantation on the outskirts of Hosanagar town and one death each has been reported from the forest on the outskirts of Sonale and Baniga villages.

Prakash C., Taluk Health Officer of Hosanagar, told The Hindu that the field staff of KFD wing of the Health and Family Welfare Department visited the spot where the deaths of monkeys were reported and have conducted the autopsy. The blood samples and viscera of the dead monkeys have been sent to laboratory for examination. If the results of the tests conducted in the laboratory confirms the infection of KFD virus in dead monkeys, a vaccination drive will be undertaken against the disease among the people residing in a radius of 5-km [3 mi] from where the death was reported, he said.

Mr Prakash said that high fever, bleeding in teeth and gums, and joint pain are some of the symptoms of KFD. The doctors serving at PHCs [primary health centers] in the villages where monkey deaths were reported have been directed to send the blood samples of the patients with these symptoms to laboratory for analysis. A symptomatic treatment would be commenced for such patients without waiting for the results of the laboratory tests, he said.

[KFD is endemic in Karnataka state. Other than Karnataka state, antibodies against KFDV have also been detected in humans in Maharashtra state, in several parts of Gujarat state, and in isolated localities like Ramtek (near Nagpur), Kingaon, and Parbatpur of West Bengal state (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7070563_Kyasanur_Forest_Disease_An_Epidemiological_View_in_India).

Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), popularly known as monkey fever, is caused by the Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ belonging to the family Flaviviridae. The KFDV was first isolated from sick monkeys captured in Kyasanur Forest, Shimoga district, Karnataka state; hence its name.

The KFD virus (KFDV) is maintained by ticks, mammals, and bird cycles. The black-faced langur (_Presbytis entellus_) and the red-faced bonnet monkey (_Macaca radiate_) act as sentinel animals, as they are very susceptible to KFDV, as humans are (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4545326/).

There is no specific treatment for KFD, but early hospitalization and supportive therapy is important. Supportive therapy includes the maintenance of hydration and the usual precautions for patients with bleeding disorders.

To prevent KFD in the local population, there is a need to create awareness of how to avoid tick bites and that KFD vaccination facilities be available in the affected areas. KFD typically occurs during the dry season from November through May, which correlates with increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease. Vaccination and personal protective measures against tick bites are keys to prevent KFD. - Mod.UBA
