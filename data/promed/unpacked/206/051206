CRORA: Summary of Report of Activities in 1995
WHO Collaborative Centre of Reference and Research on Arboviruses and
Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses
J Thonnon, A Sall, B Baudez, and JP Digoutte
Institut Pasteur de Dakar BP 220 Dakar Senegal
In 1995, the Centre identified 169 strains representing 25 different
arboviruses from Pasteur Institutes of Abidjan (4), Bangui (6), and Dakar
(159). The viruses were isolated from different regions in Africa and from
different hosts (mosquitoes, ticks, animals and humans). We identified them
as follows: Semliki Forest variant (2), Babanki (3), Ar D 65239 (close to
Bagaza) (11), Wesselsbron (1), Ar Y 310 (subtype of Wesselsbron) (2), West Nile
(7), Koutango (2), Uganda S (2), Saboya (32), Bouboui (1), yellow fever (61),
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Bunyamwera (1), Ngari (4), Bozo (1), Pongola (3), Gabek Forest (8), Ar D
66707 (Sanar) (3), Ar D 46672 (variant of Wad Medani) (1), Chandipura (7),
Salanga (1), Ar D 95737 (5), and two virus associations [dual infections]:
West Nile-Ar D 65239 (1) and Babanki-Ar D 65329 (1).
Since its inauguration, the Centre has identified 5,486 virus strains
representing 148 arboviruses or vertebrate viruses: 10 alphaviruses, 29
flaviviruses, 26 bunyaviruses, 6 phleboviruses, 6 nairoviruses,
9 bunyavirus-like viruses, 18 orbiviruses, 23 rhabdoviruses, 2 arenaviruses,
4 poxviruses, 1 orthomyxovirus and 14 unclassified and ungrouped viruses.
The reference collection currently includes 199 arboviruses or vertebrate
viruses as well as 31 other viruses.
A few outstanding events are noted:
Yellow fever
------------
* 1995 was a year of human outbreak of yellow fever in Koungheul.
This outbreak was the first one in Senegal (Djourbel) since 1965. The
Pasteur Institute supervised the epidemiological, virological, entomological
and prophylatic components of this public health emergency. 58 virus strains
were isolated from batched vectors and human samples. 79 cases of yellow
fever were investigated, confirmed by either IgM immunocapture or viral
isolation. The case fatality-rate was 18.9%. The estimated number of
infected people in the area was 879. The entomological studies and the
distribution of the cases were in accordance with a intermediate outbreak.
Vectors captured by the ORSTOM's team of entomologists, clarified the impact
of vertical transmission during this yellow fever outbreak. The relation
between the major amplification [of the virus in the wild] in 1993 in the
area of Kedougou (eastern Senegal) and the latest outbreak are being studied.
Rift Valley fever
-----------------
* The study of the maintenance cycle and emergence in nature of Rift
Valley fever (RVF) in Barkedji, in the central area of Senegal, has been
extended to the Senegal River Basin. The survey from 1987 to 1994 showed a
regular decrease of RVF prevalence in the Senegal River Basin. In 1995 at
the end of the rainy season, serological evidence of the circulation of RVF
virus in sheep was established. An alert system for emerging viruses,
especially RVF virus, along the Senegal River has been established.
*The two latest strains of RVF virus isolated in Barkedji and Kolda
have been partially sequenced. Two types of strains appear to circulate in
Senegal: Egyptian and sub-Saharan Africa.
Sand-fly vectors
----------------
* The study of pools of sand flies supplied by ORSTOM's team of
entomologists has given interesting results. The vector of Saboya virus is
known now as well as that of Chandipura virus. The unclassified strain Ar D
95737 has also been reisolated from sand flies.
