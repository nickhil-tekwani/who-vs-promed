Scientists at Ankara University have monitored the development of resistance to MBC, DMI, and QoI group fungicides with different modes of action in _Venturia inaequalis_ from apple orchards in Turkey. The sensitivity of _V. inaequalis_ from 27 orchards in 6 provinces was evaluated by mycelium growth assay and molecular tools. Baseline sensitivity was determined in wild isolates of _V. inaequalis_ from apple trees that had never been treated with any fungicides.

Results indicated that populations possessed high incidence of resistance to the DMI, MBC, and QoI fungicides. Molecular analysis confirmed high incidence of mutation in target genes associated with resistance of the pathogen to MBC and QoI fungicides.

"The resistance risk to these fungicides should be taken into consideration in the management of apple scab in Turkey. More complex strategies must be developed for the management of apple scab. Also, future studies should be performed on the sensitivity of _V. inaequalis_ to other fungicides used for control of apple scab," the scientists explained.

[Scab disease (also called black spot) caused by the fungus _Venturia inaequalis_ affects apple, crab apple, loquat, and a few other related tree species. It is considered the most economically important disease of apples worldwide. Infected fruit is often unmarketable, losses can be more than 70 percent. Symptoms may include dark leaf spots, premature leaf fall, and fruit lesions. Early infections often result in severely cracked and malformed fruit; they are most damaging since fruit becomes more resistant as it matures. Cracks in fruits may serve as entry points for other pathogens to cause rotting pre- or post-harvest.

The fungus overwinters in infected leaves on the ground. Spores are spread with infected plant material, by mechanical means, splashing rain, and can be carried long distances in air currents. Disease management is expensive, requiring up to 12 fungicide sprays per year in areas where scab has become established. Apple cultivars vary in their susceptibility to scab. Resistant varieties are available, but few of them are currently suitable for commercial production.

The related species _V. pirina_ causes scab on pear with similar symptoms. The pathogens are specific to pear and apple, respectively, and cannot cross-infect the other's hosts. Other fungi in the same genus are known to cause scab diseases on different fruit crops.

Demethylase inhibitors (DMIs; also called azoles or sterol biosynthesis inhibitors) are the largest class of fungicides; they were introduced in the 1970s and new products continue to be introduced. QoI fungicides (quinone outside inhibitors, strobilurins) are strongly antifungal agents produced by fungi; being derived from natural products, they are considered environmentally safe but, like several other fungicide classes, have single-site activity, and therefore pathogen resistance is of major concern worldwide. Methyl benzimidazole carbamates (MBCs) are used worldwide for the control of many fungal diseases; they are important agriculturally because they are highly effective, have a broad disease-control spectrum, and excellent systemic activity in the host.

Integrated disease management, including varying crops or crop cultivars in time and space, as well as rotating or mixing chemical classes of fungicides is vital to extend the useful life of host resistances and agrochemical compounds for all crops.
