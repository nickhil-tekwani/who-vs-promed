FDA Approves New Test for Detection of Human Cases of Avian Influenza
A/H5 Infection
-----------------------------------------------
[This abstracted version of the HHS News Release received from Brent
Barrett identifies the essential features of the test. The full text
of the News Release is reproduced in part [2]. It should be noted
that the test does not determine the neuraminidase serotype. - Mod.CP]
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new laboratory
test to detect human infections with avian influenza A/H5 viruses.
The test was developed at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. The FDA announced clearance of the influenza A/H5 (Asian
Lineage) Real-Time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction
Primer and Probe Set and inactivated virus as a source of positive
RNA control for the in vitro qualitative detection of highly
pathogenic influenza A/H5 virus (Asian lineage). The primer and probe
set, developed at CDC, detects influenza viruses associated with
laboratory-confirmed infections of avian influenza in humans in east
Asia, Turkey, and Iraq. A full description of the test is available
at
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm55e203a1.htm?s_cid=mm55e203a1_e>.

FDA Approves New Laboratory Test To Detect Human Infections With
Avian Influenza A/H5 Viruses: Lab Test Developed by Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention
-----------------------------------------------
The Health and Human Services' (HHS) Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) today [3 Feb 2006] announced the approval of a new laboratory
test to diagnose H5 strains of influenza in patients suspected to be
infected with the virus. The test was developed by another HHS
agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The product approved today [3 Feb 2006] is called the Influenza A/H5
(Asian lineage) Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Primer and Probe Set. The test
provides preliminary results on suspected H5 influenza samples within
4 hours once a sample arrives at the lab and testing begins. Previous
testing technology would require at least 2-3 days to render results.
If the presence of the H5 strain is identified, then further testing
is conducted to identify the specific H5 subtype (e.g., H5N1) [i.e.
the neueraminidase].
"This laboratory test is a major step forward in our ability to more
quickly detect cases of H5 avian influenza and provides additional
safeguards to protect public health," HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt
said. "Thanks to the expeditious and collaborative efforts of CDC and
FDA, the availability of this new test gives us one more tool to keep
up with the ever changing nature of influenza viruses."
Since December 2003, more than 160 human cases of avian flu caused by
the H5N1 strain of influenza have been reported in Thailand, China,
Viet Nam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Turkey and Iraq. More than half of the
people infected with the H5N1 virus have died. Nearly all of these
cases are believed to have been caused by exposure to infected
poultry. The concern is that H5N1 will evolve into a virus capable of
human-to-human transmission and lead to an influenza pandemic.
"Preparing for a possible flu pandemic is a top priority for our
nation, and FDA acted quickly to evaluate and expedite CDC's request
for approval of this test," Acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Andrew von
Eschenbach said. "Using flexible regulatory authorities, FDA was able
to prioritize this expedited approval based on the clear critical
need without compromising the quality or integrity of the FDA review process."
A flu pandemic occurs when a new influenza virus emerges for which
people have little or no immunity and for which there is no vaccine.
In an influenza pandemic, the disease spreads easily from person to
person in a sustained manner, causes serious illness, and can sweep
across the country and around the world in very short time. It is
difficult to predict when the next influenza pandemic will occur or
how severe it will be.
This test will be distributed to Laboratory Response Network
(LRN)-designated laboratories to enhance early detection and
surveillance activities as well as increase laboratory response
capacity associated with a potential pandemic. Domestically, the LRN
is a system of about 140 labs in all 50 states. LRN labs have special
experience and training in molecular testing methods, special
bio-safety facilities and containment procedures as well as
communication networks connected to public health programs across the
country. The testing kits will be distributed by CDC beginning next
week [2nd week February 2006]. CDC has also shared the test
technology with the World Health Organization and its collaborating
centers around the world.
"The use of this test by laboratories that are part of the LRN, in
conjunction with other laboratory testing and clinical observations,
may enable earlier detection of influenza cases caused by this
specific virus and allow public health agencies to investigate
sources of infection and more quickly respond with control and
prevention activities," said CDC Director Dr. Julie Gerberding.
Information obtained from this test will be used to track cases of
illness with this strain of virus. Testing for this virus is
indicated when a patient has symptoms of severe respiratory illness
and a risk of exposure (e.g., direct contact with sick, dead or
infected poultry in a country with outbreaks of influenza H5N1 among poultry).
CDC recommends that testing for influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) should
be considered on a case-by-case basis in consultation with local or
state health departments. If a clinician suspects a patient may be
infected with an avian influenza virus, they should contact their
state or local health department. CDC's full recommendations are
available at <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm55e203a1.htm>.

this approval can be found at
