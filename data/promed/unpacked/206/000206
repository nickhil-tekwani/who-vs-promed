Delaware wildlife officials are not concerned about an insect-borne disease that's killing deer.

However, the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control [DNREC] does want residents to report dead deer, for research purposes.

DNREC officials tell WDEL [Newstalk Radio] (http://bit.ly/Qaimvf) that epizootic hemorrhagic disease, or EHD, likely won't have any long-term ramifications for Delaware's deer population. The disease has been killing deer throughout North America. It does not affect humans or livestock. This year [2012], 31 deer have died from EHD in Delaware so far. The last significant EHD outbreak was in 2007, when more than 132 deer were killed.

Ohio is beginning to see the arrival of the drought-driven epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD), with 13 captive-raised deer in Middlefield Township recently dying from the almost-always fatal disease.

Mike Tonkovich, the Ohio Division of Wildlife's deer management administrator, said the Ohio Department of Agriculture has confirmed the 13 deaths from a herd of about 120 captive-raised animals.

It is the state's Agriculture Department that now administers captive deer-breeding operations.

According to Tonkovich, a northern Portage County landowner has reported seeing several dead deer along the Upper Cuyahoga River, just downstream from Geauga County. Other dead deer have been found along a water course in Monroe County.

"That would be a good indicator of the presence of EHD, though not for certain," Tonkovich said. "We need a freshly dead deer to confirm this."

EHD is a typically fatal viral disease. It is found in wild ruminants like deer, causing extensive internal bleeding and is transmitted solely by a midge, a flying critter about the size of a ground black pepper flake.

A characteristic of the disease is its sudden onset. An infected deer loses its appetite and fear of humans, grows progressively weaker, salivates excessively, and finally becomes unconscious.

Due to an accompanying high fever, an infected deer is often found sick or dead along or in bodies of water. It is here where the disease is carried by midges, super-tiny insects that need a blood host.

Importantly, biologists say, there is no evidence humans can contract the EHD virus.

The previous serious EHD outbreaks that happened in Ohio were in 2005 and 2007.

The number of deer that have died in northern Cook County from a virus not typically found in the area has reached 100, while 2 new suspected cases have turned up in Kane County, forest preserve officials said Friday [24 Aug 2012].

The 250 cases of epizootic hemorrhagic disease, or EHD, identified in 32 Illinois counties this summer [2012] are still a far cry from the nearly 2000 infected animals reported statewide in 2007, the worst year on record, officials said. But it's relatively early in the season for EHD, which typically propagates from July through October.

The 2 deer believed to have died of EHD in Kane County were found separately in ponds on private property last week [week of 20 Aug 2012], one in a business park near the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway and Randall Road, the other in a wooded area near Illinois Highway 25 and Algonquin Road, according to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.

In Cook County, the cases have been concentrated in the past 2 weeks in Schaumburg, Palatine, and Hanover townships, with newer cases discovered in the Barrington area. The condition is more commonly seen in southern and central Illinois and hadn't been known to extend into northern Cook County previously.

Deer are infected with EHD by the midge, a tiny biting fly also commonly known as a "no-see-um." Within hours of being infected, deer typically develop a fever and drool, are less likely to run from humans, and might seek a pond or stream to cool off before collapsing from internal bleeding. The disease cannot be transmitted to humans, nor does it pose a threat to domestic animals like cats and dogs, officials said.

Officials have not been able to confirm the virus in a lab but diagnose the disease based on circumstances, such as finding groups of otherwise healthy-looking deer dead by water during summer, and by the lesions it can produce in the mouth.

On Friday [24 Aug 2012], a forest preserve biologist and his co-workers patrolled Poplar Creek preserve near Hoffman Estates. Following the smell of decay, they found a new carcass of an adult in the woods, tufts of its tan coat still ruffling in the breeze as it decomposed. If a deer dies in a pond or creek, workers will pull it out so as not to foul the water, but they will leave it on land for scavengers and natural forces to dispose.

The 1st frost, generally seen in mid-October, will halt the disease by killing the midge until next year.

With much of the country experiencing drought, the hot and dry conditions are expected to generate more cases of EHD nationwide this year [2012] than any previous year except 2007, which set a record, according to Dave Stallknecht, professor at the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine, which studies the issue.

To report a dead deer on forest preserve property in Cook County, call 708-771-1180. For more information, see http://fpdcc.com/ehd.
