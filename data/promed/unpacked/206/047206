On Mon [30 Apr 2012] the province of Giza is starting the implementation of a comprehensive vaccination campaign of about 250 000 cattle heads against the new FMD strain, better known as the SAT2 strain. The vaccine was produced locally and its effectiveness significantly exceeds that of the imported vaccine. The vaccination is part of a plan of the General Organisation for Veterinary Services [GOVS] to control the disease. The campaign was announced Saturday [28 Apr 2012] evening, by the governor of Giza, Dr Ali Abdel-Rahman, and officials of the Directorate of Veterinary Service under the chairmanship of Dr Mr Gad. The governor pointed out that the plan is designed to immunize cattle in all towns and cities and would contribute to the reduction of incidence and mortality in cattle and the spread of disease. He added that the vaccination campaign will be implemented in 2 phases, initially targeting livestock centres which have not been infected yet or only on a low level. During this phase, about 25 000 head of cattle are to be vaccinated out of the total of 250 000 cattle, buffalo, sheep and goats in the province. He pointed out that the second phase of the campaign is aimed at vaccinating the rest of the livestock in the province, to be implemented during the months of June and July next. For his part, Dr Mr Gad, director of the Directorate of Veterinary Service, said that the Directorate, in parallel with the vaccination campaign, will conduct a comprehensive extension program to educate breeders and livestock owners about the importance of vaccination, pursuant to the procedures for biosecurity to control the disease. He added that the incidence of the disease in Giza Governorate has shown a marked decline during the current month.

Agriculture monitors 19 605 deaths
----------------------------------
The veterinary services within the Ministry of Agriculture have renewed, for the third month in a row, the state of emergency in relation to the epidemic caused by a new strain of FMD. This includes tightening of border controls, banning the trensfer of cattle between the centers and the provinces, closure of livestock markets, limiting the distance animals are transferred to slaughterhouses and meat distributed from them. Road controls have been intensified. These steps are to be continued until completion of the vaccination and stabilzing the disease situation.

Dr Essam Abdel Shakur, head of the central Information and Extension Service Department at the Head Office of the General Organisation of Veterinary Services [GOVS], Ministry of Agriculture, told "Al youm al-sabb'ah" that with elevated temperatures the spread of the virus, and consequently disease and mortality are to decrease. He reminded the need to report rapidly new suspected cases, to separate suspected or sick animals and prevent contact of suckling calves with infected dams. Such calves should be fed with boiled milk. Alternatively, 4 per cent sodium bicarbonate should be added to the milk, or milk replacers should be used.

Since the disease appeared on 26 Feb 2012, 82 362 suspected cases have been reported, of which 76 680 recovered while 19 655 died, most of which were young calves.

[It is to be hoped that the vaccine applied in Egypt will fulfil the expectations; in any event, a booster vaccination, initially within 1-2 months, followed by revaccinations will be required to attain the required protection level in the fully susceptible population.

In the meantime, the virus has spread across northern Sinai into cattle in Rafah in the south of the Gaza strip (Palestinian Autonomous Territories, PAT), near the Egyptian border. Samples forwarded to the Kimron Veterinary Institute at Beit-Dagan, Israel, were identified there on 19 Apr 2012 as FMDV SAT 2. The KVI subsequently forwarded a sample to the WRLFMD, Pirbright. There, the diagnosis has been confirmed and genotyping carried out, showing that the virus was 100 per cent similar to an Egyptian SAT2 strain and belongs to topotype VII. Further details, in particular the dendrogram and the strain's relatedness to reference vaccine strains, are expected to be published by WRLFMD as soon as the publication is sanctioned by the PAT.

Initially, the clinical signs of the disease in the Gaza strip seemed to be mild; we are informed that this has changed later to become a more serious disease manifestation. Vaccinations with a FMDV SAT2 vaccine (based upon an Eritrean vaccine strain, belonging to topotype VII, which is the topotype of the Libyan, Egyptian and PAT strains), have already been applied in Israeli livestock along the borders with the Gaza strip and Sinai (Egypt) as well as within the Gaza strip. Intensive surveillance activities have been undertaken throughout Israel, the Gaza strip and the West Bank (PAT). - Mod.AS
