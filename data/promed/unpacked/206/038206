Health Authorities in Honduras declare an alert for an outbreak of pneumonia
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Health authorities in Honduras have been placed on alert, because in
recent days Nicaragua has suffered an outbreak of pneumonia, and it is
possible that in the coming hours it will invade Honduras. There have
already been some cases of pneumonia in the Honduran capital
[Tegucigalpa].

The head of the Metropolitan Region of Health, Dr. Ramon Arita, said
"We have learned from various sources that the situation in Nicaragua
is difficult, and we want to take preventive measures in Honduras."

In recent weeks, the increase has been substantial, with 302 reported
cases of pneumonia in the country [in Honduras in the last week?] and
a total of 4 825 so far this year [2008], Arita said.
