The Viral Etiology and Pathogenesis of Ovine Pulmonary Carcinoma
----------------------------------------------------------------
[Dr. Kalman Perk has sent the following comment on the recent ProMED-mail
report "Ovine pulmonary carcinoma: viral etiology 20010412.0725".
The first clear morphological and biochemical evidence of the presence of
retroviruses in ovine pulmonary carcinoma was published as early as 1971
and 1974 (Perk, K, Hod, I, and Nobel, TA, Journal of the National Cancer
Institute 46:523-537; 47:197-205; and, Perk, K, Michalides, R, Spiegelman,
S and Schlom, J, Journal of the National Cancer Institute 53:131-136, 1974).
Furthermore, the first ultrastructural and histochemical evidence of the
origin of the epithelial pulmonary tumor was also reported by our group in
1971. In a series of further papers we addressed biochemical aspects of
this retrovirus, etiology, epidemiology, and its relationship to relevant
other small ruminant retroviruses.
The analogy to human bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma was published by us as
an editorial article in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute
69:747-749, 1982, entitled "Sheep lung carcinoma: An endemic analogue of a
sporadic human neoplasm."
