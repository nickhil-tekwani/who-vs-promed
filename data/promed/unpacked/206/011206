From: Marjorie P. Pollack <pollackmp@mindspring.com>

I just received an email from WHO with correct information on the viral
hemorrhagic fever report - Uganda. It seems the newswire report was wrong
and the information referred to the Durba [D.R. Congo outbreak (as Jack
Woodall had suspected). The message came with a table [included in
subsequent/separate ProMED-mail report.
It is a tribute to ProMED-mail that folks in WHO are subscribers and have
been readily willing and helpful to send correct information when the
newswire services have posted misinformation. Thanks to Dr. Nestor
Ndayimirije for setting the record straight and for sharing the
epidemiologic information.
