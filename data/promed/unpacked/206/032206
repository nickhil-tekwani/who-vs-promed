Coined 'Disease X', a new strain of bird flu -- H7N9 -- has sparked fears of a major outbreak among scientists, having already infected more than 1600 people.

Symptoms of infection include fever, coughing, shortness of breath, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and organ failure. The virus has already killed 623 people within China.

At this time, the H7N9 can't be spread between humans -- and can only be contracted from contact with birds. However, experts suspect as few as 3 mutations could result in a human-to-human contagion -- and potentially a worldwide pandemic.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said: "Influenza viruses constantly change and it is possible that this virus could gain the ability to spread easily and sustainably among people, triggering a global outbreak of disease."

England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam also expressed fears that H7N9 'could be the cause of the next pandemic'.

[According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), A(H7N9) avian influenza viruses continue to be detected by agricultural authorities in China. A nationwide domestic poultry vaccination plan is underway. Overall, the risk assessments have not changed.

The disease severity during the '5th wave' of human cases of avian influenza A/H7N9 has been more severe as compared to the previous ones, which indicates the need for continued surveillance in animals and humans to monitor the evolutionary changes as close to real time as possible. - Mod.UBA
