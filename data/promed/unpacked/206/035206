Yellow Fever Death Toll Reaches 11 in southeastern Brazil
---------------------------------------------------------
The outbreak of yellow fever in southeastern Brazil has claimed 11 lives in
the past 2 weeks, health officials said Thursday [1 Mar 2001.
Carlos Patricio de Freitas, Health Minister for the southeastern state of
Minas Gerais, met with the mayors of the 7 communities hard hit by the
outbreak, assuring them that the public would be vaccinated against yellow
fever.
He said many municipalities had failed to warn the public of the outbreak,
for fear of chasing away tourists who had come to the area to enjoy
carnival festivities.
