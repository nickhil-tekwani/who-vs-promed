UNDIAGNOSED ILLNESS, SCHOOL - USA (CONNECTICUT)

Lisbon Central School officials report that 122 of 630 students enrolled at
the school were unable to attend classes on Friday because of an outbreak
of vomiting, diarrhea and high fever among them. Many of the students
became ill after arriving at school. Certain classroom groups seemed
particularly hard hit, suggesting to school officials that an infectious
agent is being transmitted among the students. More than half of the
victims had not eaten the school hot lunch, and the school's water supply
was found to be free of coliform contamination in routine testing last
Tuesday, so food poisoning or water contamination seem unlikely. No
hospitalizations have been reported.
