The State Health Department yesterday [15 Aug 2013] reported that 26 cases of "super-bug" carbapenem-resistant Enterobaceriaceae (CRE) infections were recorded between January and July 2013 in Sibu Hospital after initially denying any outbreak of these cases in an earlier statement. Bukit Asset assemblyman Wong Ho Leng had issued a press statement on Wednesday [14 Aug 2013] demanding the Health Ministry explain the outbreak of the superbug infection in Sibu Hospital.

In a statement confirming the cases yesterday [15 Aug 2013], State Health director Datu Dr Zulkifli Jantan said that out of these cases, 9 had resulted in deaths, but these fatalities had yet to be audited to confirm [their deaths were directly due to] infection of CRE. "All the 9 deaths involved patients who might have died from their underlying illnesses or pre-existing complications. So at the moment, we do not know the exact figure for deaths directly caused by CRE," Dr Zulkifli told The Borneo Post yesterday [15 Aug 2013].

He said measures had been taken by Sibu Hospital that involved the intensification of infection control activities on patients, staff and wards to arrest the outbreak.

"However, whatever measures taken do not necessarily have to be made known to the public. We just handle it. There will be specific steps to take, and we have taken all of them," said Dr Zulkifli. The 1st step was to inform the staff so patients would be handled with caution, he added. "We also need to do surveillance, where patients would be swabbed to grow bacteria for observation."

Dr Zulkifli reiterated that such incidents could happen in any hospital. Apart from CRE, there were other bacteria which might develop resistance to other antibiotics.

So far, only Sibu Hospital had recorded an outbreak of CRE infections, and Dr Zulkifli confirmed that no outbreak had been reported in all of the other hospitals in the state, including Sarawak General Hospital in Kuching, Miri Hospital and Bintulu Hospital. Dr Zulkifli will call a press conference today [16 Aug 2013] for a full explanation and field questions from the media.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta sounded an alarm over CRE earlier this year [2013]. CRE causes bladder, lung, and blood infections that can spiral into life-threatening septic shock. They evade the action of almost all antibiotics -- including the carbapenems, which are considered drugs of last resort -- and kill up to half of all patients who contract them, according to Nature, an international weekly journal of science.
