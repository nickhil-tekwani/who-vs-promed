Farmers want the federal and state governments to stop bickering over
the sugar industry rescue package for fear it is delaying growers
from replanting.
About 39 000 hectares of cane is expected to be ploughed in and
replanted with smut-resistant varieties over the next 4 years.
The fungal disease sugarcane smut was found in the Childers district
in mid-June. It cuts production by 30 per cent and could cause
hundreds of millions of dollars' damage to the state's crops if it
cannot be contained in the Bundaberg, Isis and Childers regions.
Growers in the Isis and Childers area had been waiting nearly a month
to start replanting but were not prepared to do so until they knew
what was in the package which was expected to cost AUD 50 to $80
million [USD 38-61 million].
Mr Ballantyne said the smut outbreak was the 1st time the
inter-governmental Emergency Plant Pest Deed had been triggered in
Australia and he understood all governments were anxious to get it right.
"We're seeing the states and feds jockeying for position," Mr
Ballantyne said. "Growers will be directed to plough out susceptible
varieties so it means they will destroy good crops. They need to know
how it will occur and under what conditions and what costs will be offset."
Primary Industries Department general manager of plant biosecurity
Chris Adriaansen said it was hoped the plan would be ready next week.
Mr Adriaansen said issues still to be resolved included compensation
and terms under which cane varieties would be replaced.
Mr Adriaansen said just 3 new properties have been found with the
disease in the past 6 days, bringing to 54 the number infected. About
35 properties were still to be inspected.
Mr Ballantyne said no cane would be on show at this year's Bundaberg
and Childers shows in an effort to help prevent the spread of disease.

[The crop plant sugarcane, _Saccharum officinarum_, develops symptoms
of the disease smut when infected by the fungus _Ustilago scitaminea_.
An outbreak of sugarcane smut occurred in the Childers area,
Queensland (400 km north of Brisbane), Australia on 6 Jun 2006
(20060612.1643). This was a 1st report for Queensland and eastern
Australia. The last outbreak of sugarcane smut in Australia was in
Western Australia in 1997. An official report was sent from the
Office of the Chief Plant Protection Officer, Australian Government
Department of Agriculture Fisheries & Forestry to ProMED-mail on 22
Jun 2006 (20060625.1772) in which it was stated, "As of 16 Jun 2006,
multiple infected plants have been found in one block of cane of the
same property with another suspect plant in an adjacent block,
indicating some spread. The property remains quarantined, with
movements of host plants and machinery prohibited."
Since that report the total number of properties known to be infected
has risen to 54 (see this article) and new extended quarantined areas
are in place. The Childers region produces up to 12 per cent of the
nation's sugar.
The major national sugarcane industry is in eastern Australian where
growers and regulators are taking the new disease (for them) very
seriously. The Australian Bureau of Sugar Experiment Station (BSES)
has created a web site (See "Links") that contains regular updates on
sugarcane smut in eastern Australia. The Queensland Department of
Primary Industries and Fisheries also has a web site dedicated to the
current 2006 outbreak of sugarcane smut (See "Links"). Both are
worth consulting.
Destruction and burning of infected materials and a plan to replace
old plantings with more resistant varieties are at the heart of
future plans to manage the disease, and the co-ordination of this
effort between growers and regulators is the main topic of this
article. Compensation to growers is clearly an issue.
The impact that restricted movement of sugarcane, which is mentioned
in the article, had on a local agricultural show in the Isis district
near Childers on the weekend of 5 Aug 2006 is described in a popular
article for which a web link is provided in "Links". The following
is a quote from that article, "One of the stewards for the CCS class
was Isis Productivity Limited's Bruce Quinn. Mr Quinn says it's going
to be a sad day to see no sugarcane at the show. "It's been very
fiercely battled between a few of the growers over here in the past.
It's a shame after all these years we're not going to have a cane
section this year.""
It remains to be seen what the future impact of this outbreak of
sugarcane smut is going to be on Australia's sugar industry though
early predictions are optimistic (see "Links")
