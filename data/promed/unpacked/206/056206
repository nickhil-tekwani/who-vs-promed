["Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules, caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form also occurs, known as farcy.

Glanders is transmissible to humans by direct contact with diseased animals or with infected or contaminated material. In the untreated acute disease, the mortality rate can reach 95 percent within 3 weeks. However, survival is possible if the infected person is treated early and aggressively with multiple systemic antibiotic therapies. A chronic form with abscessation can occur.

Glanders has been eradicated from many countries by statutory testing, culling of infected animals, and import restrictions. It persists in numerous Asian, African and South American countries and can be considered a reemerging disease. Glanders can be introduced into glanders-free areas by movement of equids."
