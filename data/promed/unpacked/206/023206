Headlines
- New on <www.polioeradication.org>: Technical advisory groups met last week to review progress made to eradicate polio in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and advise on the way forward to further improve the quality of programme implementation during the low transmission season.
- In Pakistan, the polio eradication programme and the routine immunization programme are working hand in hand to increase vaccination coverage in urban areas.
- Pakistan and Afghanistan are implementing sub-national rounds during the 2nd half of December; the rounds are synchronized to ensure that all the high risk mobile populations are efficiently reached with polio vaccine.

Summary of newly-reported viruses this week:
- A total of 1 new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) reported in Sindh province, Pakistan. This follows the advance notification of the case last week.
- Afghanistan: 2 new WPV1 positive environmental samples reported, both collected from Nangarhar province.
- Pakistan: 2 new WPV1 positive environmental samples reported, 1 from Sindh province, and 1 from Balochistan province.
- Syria: 4 new circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases reported, all from Deir Ez-Zor governorate.
- An advance notification has been received of 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case in Balochistan province, Pakistan. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting.

Afghanistan
- A total of 2 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) positive environmental samples were reported this week, both collected from Jalalabad district in Nangarhar province on [25 Nov 2017].
- No new cases of WPV1 have been reported. The total number of officially reported WPV1 cases in Afghanistan in 2017 remains 11.
- The next round of sub-national immunization days are planned for the 2nd half of December 2017.

Pakistan
- A total of 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was officially reported this week in Karachi Gadap district, Sindh province, with onset [9 Nov 2017]. This follows advance notification of the case in last week's data reporting.
- The total number of officially reported WPV1 cases in Pakistan in 2017 is now 6.
- An advance notification has been received of one new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case in Balochistan province. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting.
- Field investigations are continuing into the newly reported polio case and a response is being planned.
- Two new WPV1 positive environmental samples were reported this week, one collected from Karachi Landhi district in Sindh province on [16 Nov 2017], and one collected from Loralai district, in Balochistan province on [17 Nov 2017].
- The next round of sub-national immunization days are planned for the 2nd half of December 2017.

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016] in Monguno Local Government Area, Borno.
- Nigeria continues to implement an emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016).
- The next round of sub-national immunization days are planned for late January [2018].
- Detection of polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission. As part of the emergency response, subnational surveillance continues to be strengthened.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno state, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto states in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These activities include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons camps, and at international borders.
- Phase 3 of outbreak response is going ahead in January [2018], taking into account many of the recommendations made at the recent Outbreak Response Assessment and Technical Advisory Group meetings. The objective is to maintain and improve the multi-national, regional outbreak response across the Lake Chad region.
- During the Niger bOPV campaign in November [2017], children in 29 health districts were vaccinated, including in Diffa and Zinder provinces, near the border with Nigeria. The campaign in Niger strengthened the immunity of over 3 million children under 5 years of age against polio.
- Vaccinators additionally used the polio infrastructure to provide Vitamin A and deworming tablets.

Central Africa
- No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year is 10.
- Most cases this year are linked to an outbreak in Haut Lomami province, where the onset of paralysis of the most recent case was [27 Jul 2017].
- A separate outbreak occurred in Maniema province earlier this year, consisting of 2 cases with onset of paralysis on [26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017], with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May [2017].
- Outbreak response continues to take place across the country, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.
- Immunization activities recently completed aimed to vaccinate over 10 million children with bOPV vaccine.
- Surveillance and immunization activities continue to be strengthened in neighbouring countries.

Middle East (Syria)
- A total of 4 new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported this week, 3 from Mayadeen district, and 1 from Boukamal district, in Deir Ez-Zor governorate. The cases had onset on [4 Aug 2017, 5 Sep 2017, 8 Sep 2017, and 21 Sep 2017]. The most recent case (by date of onset) is now [21 Sep 2017] in Boukamal district.
- The total number of confirmed cVDPV2 cases is now 74.
- Global Polio Eradication Initiative partners continue to support the Syrian Ministry of Health with planning for the 2nd phase of the outbreak response.
- Local authorities in Raqqa have agreed to carry out inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) vaccination in Ein Esa camp, which was missed in earlier IPV vaccination activities.
- A new environmental surveillance laboratory has been successfully established in Damascus this week. WHO led the training of surveillance officers and staff from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Water Resources.

[Take away messages from this week's global update:
Good news:
- 50 percent reduction in confirmed WPV1 cases in 2017 (to date) compared with 2016 (17 vs 34 respectively to date).

Not so good news:
- Marked increase in confirmed cVDPV cases in 2017 compared with 2016 (84 vs 3 respectively)
- WPV1 continues circulation in Afghanistan and Pakistan as evidenced by continued confirmation of cases of paralytic disease attributable to infection with WPV1 and the continued isolation of WPV1 in environmental samples.
- It appears as though environmental sampling isolation of WPV1 often pre-dates identification of case of paralytic polio disease as observed in recent experiences in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
- A total of 2 new paralytic cases of WPV1 associated polio confirmed in Pakistan: 1 in Karachi Gadap district, Sindh province (reported as an advanced notification in last week's report - see Poliomyelitis update (40): global (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Syria) 20171207.5489424) and 1 in Balochistan province, (reported as an advance notification in this week's report)
- cVDPV2 associated cases in Syria's Deir-Ez-Sor governorate continue to be confirmed with 4 newly confirmed cases in past week (see Poliomyelitis update (41): Syria 20171213.5500907).
