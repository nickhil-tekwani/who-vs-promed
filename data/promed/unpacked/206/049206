Police and animal control officers are watching an area in Stanhope for rabies after 5 people and 2 dogs were attacked along streets near Lake Musconetcong, officials said.

Four foxes and one raccoon have been destroyed by local police officers after a handful of people were attacked this week. Rabies is a possible cause of the attacks, and officials are watching the area around Lake Musconetcong closely after foxes rushed people walking their dogs and a pair of police officers, officials said.

"Foxes aren't like that; there has to be something wrong," said Dale Sloat, the borough's animal control officer. "If any one of them has rabies, then all of them have rabies."

The 4 foxes and a raccoon were destroyed Thursday [5 Sep 2013] after 2 dogs and a woman were bitten, said Chief Steven Pittigher of the Stanhope police. A total of 5 people were rushed by animals the day before, added Pittigher. A sick fox was reported on Spencer Street during daylight on Tuesday [3 Sep 2013], a strange time for a sighting, the chief said. But by the time the police responded, the fox had disappeared, he said.

The next day [4 Sep 2013], a man and his dog were rushed by a fox coming out of the brush on Brooklyn Road, Pittigher said. The dog was bitten by the fox before it ran off, he added. On Musconetcong Road about 2 hours later, a woman walking her dog was attacked by a fox, and both were bitten, he said.

Two brothers were attacked at the other end of Musconetcong Road about an hour later, at 7:30 p.m., the chief said. The fox ripped the pants of one of the brothers, and the other man was bitten on the shoe, but neither are believed to have had puncture wounds from the animal, he added. Two police officers responding to the area were rushed by the fox, and though one of them drew his weapon and fired 2 rounds at the fox, it ran off.

The state Division of Fish and Wildlife was consulted on Thursday [5 Sep 2013], and the decision to destroy sick-looking animals in the area was approved, Pittigher. Over the course of the day, police officers destroyed 4 foxes and a raccoon, he said. The foxes' brains are currently being tested for rabies, Pittigher said.

The strange, aggressive behavior of the animals could be caused by distemper, a virus which is not transferable to humans, Sloat said. But every precaution has to be taken [Raccoons with distemper seldom behave in such an aggressive manner, but it cannot be ruled out without proper testing. - Mod.TG]. "I've got to watch every mammal in that area," Sloat said. "We just have to be vigilant."

Police are currently on the lookout for other suspicious animals. The chief is urging the public to report any suspected animals by calling the station at (973) 347-4533.

[2] Oral Rabies Vaccine
Date: 3 Sep 2013

http://nhpr.org/post/usda-airdrops-vanilla-flavored-rabies-vaccines-over-eastern-forests


The United States Department of Agriculture is distributing vanilla flavored rabies vaccine packets from airplanes over New Hampshire. The packets will show up in Coos and Grafton counties as part of 5-state pilot study of a new rabies vaccine.

The vaccines are thrown from 500 feet from a small aircraft over rural areas and distributed by hand in towns. They're vanilla flavored, which trials have shown to be a favorite flavor for critters.

"Vanilla seems to be working pretty effectively," says project's field coordinator Jordana Kirby, "but the other vaccine that we are using is a fishmeal based attractant, and that one also seems to be working pretty well."

The goal of the program is 1st to keep rabies from spreading north into Canada by creating a swath of immunized animals along the northern extreme of the rabies virus' range. If that goal is a success, eventually the USDA hopes to expand the area of immunized wildlife farther south.

This is the 2nd year of the study of a vaccine -- ONRAB -- that is already widely used in Canada. The USDA has been distributing another vaccine using the same method since 1997.

Kirby says the vaccine baits are safe for pets, but if residents come across them and are worried that they will be eaten by dogs or toddlers, they can move them to areas more likely to contain raccoons and skunks.

The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services has confirmed 25 cases of rabies so far in 2013, mostly in raccoons, skunks and foxes.

[3] Oral Rabies Vaccine

http://www.pressherald.com/news/USDA-tests-wildlife-rabies-vaccine-in-five-states-.html


The U.S. Department of Agriculture is tossing marshmallow-flavored plastic packets of rabies vaccine out of airplanes in northern New York and parts of Vermont, New Hampshire, Ohio and West Virginia.

The work is part of a 3rd U.S. field trial of a vaccine to control rabies in raccoons, skunks and other wildlife. Biologists are evaluating the safety and immune effects of the vaccine. So far, they've found it effective in raccoons, coyotes and foxes, but it hasn't proven effective in combating rabies in skunks.

The plastic blister packs are being distributed this month [September 2013] by airplane drop and by people on the ground. The olive green rectangular packets are a little bigger than a quarter.

The USDA says pets won't be harmed if they find and eat a vaccine packet.

[The 1st article does not tell us whether the woman who was bitten is receiving post exposure prophylaxis, but hopefully that is the case.

The oral rabies vaccine has worked well in the past in other regions of the country. The marshmallow flavor is a new one, and we hope it works well. - Mod.TG
