Vesicular Stomatitis in Bolivia
--------------------------------------
Translation of information received on 22 Apr 2004 from Dr Marcelo Lara
Godoy, National Head of Animal Health, Servicio Nacional de Sanidad
Agropecuaria (SENASAG), Trinidad:
End of previous report period: 12 April 2004 (see Disease Information, 17
[16], 112, dated 16 Apr 2004).
End of this report period: 21 Apr 2004.
There are currently no suspected cases of vesicular stomatitis under
investigation in Bolivia, nor any active outbreaks. The latest outbreak was
considered ended on 31 Mar 2004, 30 days after the last case.
The disease has been kept under control by implementing sanitary measures,
thereby preventing it from spreading, and maintaining epidemiological
surveillance activities.
Since there were no other outbreaks, the emergency was ended. Restrictions
on the movements of animals of susceptible species have been relaxed and
control measures are being maintained in the zone.
