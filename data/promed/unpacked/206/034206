----------------------------------
Abstract:
In spring 2013, influenza A(H7N9) virus was isolated from an apparently healthy tree sparrow in Chongming Dongping National Forest Park, Shanghai City, China. The entire gene constellation of the virus is similar to that of isolates from humans, highlighting the need to monitor influenza A(H7N9) viruses in different species.

Conclusions [abridged, references left out]:
The high similarity of genes from the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus from an apparently healthy tree sparrow in Shanghai and influenza A(H7N9) viruses from humans and poultry in this region indicate that avian influenza A(H7N9) virus might be transmitted from poultry to tree sparrows or vice versa.

Earlier reports documented that influenza A viruses, including subtypes H5N1 and H3N2, have been isolated from sparrows. A serologic survey also suggested that rates of influenza A virus infection were high among sparrows, which might result from abundant distribution of avian influenza virus receptor SA a2,3Gal in the respiratory tracts of sparrows. The novel subtype H7N9 virus expands not only the number of influenza virus subtypes that infect tree sparrows but also the range of hosts for subtype H7N9 viruses. Our finding of only one subtype H7N9-positive sample among 2198 samples is consistent with recent findings that subtype H7N9 in wild birds is rare.

Tree sparrows are abundant and widely distributed in China. They are frequently in contact with humans and poultry. Prevalence of avian influenza viruses among tree sparrows could increase opportunities for them to carry influenza viruses from aquatic birds to domestic farms and even to humans. Hence, such expansion of influenza A(H7N9) virus host ranges undoubtedly increases the seriousness of the threat of this novel subtype.

Dongping National Forest Park, where the novel subtype H7N9-positive tree sparrow was captured, is on Chongming Island, China's 3rd largest island, which is located in the Australia-East Asia migratory wild bird flyway. Dongping National Forest Park is adjacent to Dongtan National Nature Reserve, where hundreds of species of migratory and domestic birds gather for winter. Whether migratory birds became infected through contact with tree sparrows and then disseminated subtype H7N9 virus to other geographic regions merits further investigation. Isolation of novel influenza A(H7N9) virus in a tree sparrow emphasizes the need to expand influenza surveillance to not only domestic birds but also wild and terrestrial birds.

[It may be speculated that if similar surveillance activities were applied in relation to other birds, tree sparrows will not remain solitary. Such was the case when efforts were directed to create the list of bird species which were found infected with another avian influenza virus at the center of public attention, namely H5N1. Subscribers are invited to visit the List of Species Affected by H5N1 (Avian Influenza) at the web-site of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), where not less than 167 bird species (including the House sparrow _Passer domesticus_ and the Eurasian tree-sparrow _Passer montanus_ can be found (http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/disease_information/avian_influenza/affected_species_chart.jsp).

The significance for public or animal health of a single H7N9-positive sample among 2198 samples examined remains questionable. In case the source for A/H7N9 virus in live bird markets is the issue of interest, priority should be presently given to enhanced surveillance in domestic poultry holdings. - Mod.AS
