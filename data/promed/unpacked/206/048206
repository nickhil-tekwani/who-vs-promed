Bidi is a popular form of native cigarette -- a bit smaller than a
conventional cigarette. In bidi the tobacco is rolled in a tendu leaf. The
tendu tree is found abundantly in the jungles of Jharkhand state.
Almost the entire bidi making process is manual. Bidi making provides
jobs to thousands of bidi workers. [The disease] could be related to
tobacco processing / handling / inhalation etc.
