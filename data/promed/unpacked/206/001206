In March [2019?], camels in Turkmenistan's western Balkan Province started dying off. Officials did not say anything about the cause. Locals thought it was from smallpox.

Balkan residents believed it was smallpox because in October 2018, the disease struck hard, killing camels but also spreading to people, several of whom were admitted to hospitals and treated for the virus.

[Turkmenistan's camel population (OIE data, 2018) counts 128 200. Almost all of the country's camels are dromedaries (there are about 3000 Bactrian camels).

The following information about camelpox, an OIE-listed disease, is extracted from OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, chapter 3.9.2. Camelpox (Version adopted in May 2014):

"Camelpox is a wide-spread infectious viral disease of Old World camelids. New World camelids are also susceptible. It occurs throughout the camel-breeding areas of Africa, north of the equator, the Middle East and Asia, and has an important economic impact through loss of production and sometimes death. The camelpox virus belongs to the family Poxviridae, subfamily Chordopoxvirinae, genus _Orthopoxvirus_.

The disease is characterised by fever, local or generalised pox lesions on the skin and in the mucous membranes of the mouth and respiratory tract. The clinical manifestations range from inapparent infection to mild, moderate and, less commonly, severe systemic infection and death.

The disease occurs more frequently and more severely in young animals and pregnant females.

Transmission is by either direct contact between infected and susceptible animals or indirect infection via a contaminated environment. The role of insects in transmission has been suspected because the disease is often observed after rainfall.

Camelpox virus is very host specific and does not infect other animals. Zoonotic camelpox virus infection in humans associated with outbreaks in dromedary camels (_Camelus dromedarius_) was described in the north-eastern region of India during 2009. This was a single incident illustrating that camelpox is of limited public health importance;" https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.09.02_CAMELPOX.pdf.

In view of the above chapter, the information about several people "admitted to hospitals and treated" for the camelpox virus is in need of confirmation or otherwise. Any relevant information will be appreciated.

In case camelpox in camels has been recorded in recent years in Turkmenistan, it should be duly reported. There are 88 terrestrial animal diseases in OIE's 2018/2019 list. In Turkmenistan's last annual report to the OIE, only 6 listed diseases were present in the country during 2018: Brucellosis (_Brucella abortus_); Brucellosis (_Brucella melitensis_); _Echinococcus granulosus_; Rabies; Sheep pox/goat pox; and Theileriosis. - Mod.AS
