[1] Egypt: H1N1/H5N1 fatality rates
Date: Mon 10 Jan 2011

When [a child's] body temperature rose slightly, his father immediately
took him to hospital to make sure the 10 year old did not have the H1N1
virus, otherwise known as swine flu [influenza A/(H1N1) virus]. Doctors
tried to convince the boy's father that the rise in the boy's temperature
did not necessarily mean he had swine flu, but the father was adamant the
boy be tested.

The boy was diagnosed negative, though the country's hospitals have been on
high alert after 5 more people died in the governorates of Gharbia, Port
Said, Ismaillia, and Monofiya because of the [A/(H5N1) avian influenza]
virus. "Dozens of suspected cases [of avian influenza A/H5N1) virus
infection] arrive at the hospitals every day," said Nassr Al-Sayed,
assistant minister of health for preventive medicine. "We are raising our
alert levels in case an outbreak happens," he told IRIN.

The Health Ministry announced on 4 Jan 2011 that it had detected 838 new
confirmed H1N1 cases across the nation in December [2010]. It said it had
detected 2171 cases since October 2010 and 24 people had died. "But
infection rates are still within normal limits compared with infections
during the last winter season [2009-2010]," said ministry spokesman
Abdelrahman Shahin.

There were 14 846 confirmed H1N1 infections in Egypt last year [2010],
according to the Health Ministry. Shahin advised citizens to avoid
overcrowded places and take precautionary measures, including frequent hand
washing and using a handkerchief. He expected the number of cases to
subside by the end of January [2011].

While a large number of people are worried about H1N1 and look suspiciously
at people sneezing in public places because of the fear of contracting it,
it is avian flu (H5N1) -- mainly transmitted to humans from animals (birds)
-- which is a deadlier killer if one looks at the statistics. On 5 Jan
2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the Health Ministry had
announced 4 new human cases of H5N1 in December [2010], leading to 2
deaths. The 2 fatal cases had had contact with poultry, WHO reported,
adding that an investigation into the source of infection in the 2 other
non-fatal cases was under way. [For further information, see ProMED-mail

According to the WHO list of countries where H5N1 has been reported, Egypt
has the highest number of cases (119 so far) outside of South East Asia.
With 40 fatalities and an almost 34 per cent fatality rate, it is a much
deadlier killer than H1N1. For instance, the 24 H1N1 deaths since October
[2010] (out of 2171 cases) translate into a 1.1 percent fatality rate --
roughly 30 times less than for H5N1.

Specific features of influenza related deaths during the A(H1N1) pandemic
in 2009-2010 in France
----------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Introduction: This article compares the demographic and medical features of
influenza related deaths during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in
2009-2010 to seasonal influenza related deaths since 2000, as observed from
the death certificates in France.

Methods: Different parameters of age and sex distribution were established
for the 2009-2010 influenza pandemic and for all preceding influenza
seasons since 2000. The average number of diagnoses mentioned on the death
certificates and the frequency of pathologies declared concomitantly to
influenza were studied. Death certificates mentioning "influenza A" and
"unspecified influenza" were distinguished in 2009-2010.

Results: 349 influenza related deaths were registered during the pandemic.
The average age of death was 59.4 years in 2009-2010 versus 81.7 years
during the preceding seasons. The number of diagnoses reported on the death
certificates was higher in 2009-2010. The specific pathologies studied
appear with a similar frequency on the death certificates during the
different seasons.

Conclusion: Influenza related deaths in 2009-2010 present atypical
demographic features in comparison to preceding seasons. The population
concerned is much younger. On the other hand, the co morbidities of the
deceased people are similar.

[Taken together these reports reinforce the message that the avian A/(H5N1)
influenza virus is potentially a greater threat to human welfare than the
pandemic A/(H1N1) 2009 virus. - Mod.CP]
