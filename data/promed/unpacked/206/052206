Peel Public Health is part of a team investigating a recent increase of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Infantis cases in the province -- half of which were in the region. There have been 20 cases in total. Along with Peel, 7 cases were found in Toronto, one in York region, one in Hastings Prince Edward County and one in Halton, according to Dr. Lawrence Loh, Peel's medical officer of health, in a 21 Sep 2021 health professionals update.

Three of the people who contracted _Salmonella_ have been hospitalized with no reported deaths. There are additional probable cases under investigation, Loh said. Multiple restaurants in the Greater Toronto Area that served dishes with shredded pork or pork rind and skin have been identified as suspected sources of the outbreak. Food specimens from all implicated locations have tested positive for _Salmonella_. In his report, Loh said the restaurants purchased the product in unlabelled packages that were obtained from a potentially uninspected supplier.

A food safety investigation is underway by the Peel, Toronto and York public health units, along with the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs as well as the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

[A similar outbreak from UK-produced pork products was reported on ProMED earlier this year (2021) due to _S._ Infantis. The serotype here and the number of identified cases were not stated in the initial posting [Salmonellosis - Canada: (ON) pork products, alert 20210922.8694341], but is now reported as Infantis. It is not clear if the UK and the Canadian strains are genetically linked, but they may be. It is unclear if the products were distributed in other provinces or countries. - Mod.LL
