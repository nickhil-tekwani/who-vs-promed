[Rubella, also called German measles, is a disease spread by the coughs and sneezes of infected people. Symptoms include rash and fever for 2-3 days. Rubella on its own is not a high-risk infection. But rubella is very dangerous for a pregnant woman and her developing baby. If a pregnant woman gets rubella virus, her baby could have birth defects such as deafness, cataracts (blurred vision), heart defects, mental disabilities, and organ damage. Pregnant women who are not protected against rubella through either vaccination with the MMR vaccine or previous rubella infection should not travel to Japan during this outbreak.
