A TEXVETMED POST
Rabies in Willacy County
-------------------------------
For those of you that keep track of the rabies laboratory reports,
you may have noted that Willacy County in Texas came up
frequently last month (August 1999). There has been a localized
outbreak of the canine strain of rabies in domestic pets in a very
small town (pop. about 100) there. This is the largest localized
outbreak of dog rabies in South Texas since 1995.
During August, a total of 6 animals from Willacy County were
reported rabid: 4 dogs, 1 coyote, and 1 cat. The 4 dogs and 1 cat
were all from the town of Lasara; the coyote was from eastern
Willacy County midway between San Perlita and Port Mansfield.
Some details:
Date Reported Animal Human Exposures
---------------------------------------------------------------------
8/6/99 1.5 y.o. unvaccinated female dog salivary - 2 people
8/10/99 2 month old unvax male dog 1 bitten, 1 salivary
8/13/99 adult stray unvax male dog none
8/20/99 5 month old male dog* salivary - 1 person
*vaccinated 8/13/99 - already infected
8/26/99 adult stray/feral unvax cat 3 persons bitten
8/18/99 juvenile coyote no humans exposed
Other rabies cases from Willacy County during 1999 include 1 dog
from Lasara reported in February, and 1 coyote from San Perlita
reported in February.
During 1999, Willacy County has reported the most animal rabies
cases among Region 11 counties, and the most cases associated
with the canine strain in Texas. The only other canine strain rabies
case during 1999 was in a raccoon in Webb County in April.
Six cases of bat rabies have also been reported this year in
Region 11 (2 in Cameron, 1 in Kleberg, and 3 in Webb Counties),
bringing the total reported animal rabies cases in the Region to 15
for 1999.
Previously in Willacy County, 2 coyotes and 1 dog from the Lasara
area were reported rabid in 1997, and 1 coyote and 1 dog from
Lasara and 1 coyote from Raymondville were reported rabid in
1998. This indicates that coyote and domestic dog rabies due to
the canine strain continues to smolder in this area. The Oral
Rabies Vaccination Program for coyotes in South Texas has
resulted in a decrease in coyote rabies cases, but pet owners must
continue to vaccinate their dogs (and cats) to protect them from
rabies.
The canine strain of rabies CAN result in a dog-to-dog
transmission cycle if there is an unvaccinated, free-roaming dog
population, which is what is occurring in Lasara. Stray animal
control and pet vaccination have been increased in Lasara to
break this transmission cycle. These are the "tried and true"
rabies control measures for urban dog rabies, which exists in
developing countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa.
In the US, we've primarily seen outbreaks of dog rabies from
canine strains of the rabies virus along the US/Mexico border.
These outbreaks have usually been localized to a city/town, and
they're interrupted by increasing the level of vaccinated dogs and
decreasing the stray/free-roaming dog population. Makes sense,
but the public seems to forget about rabies fairly quickly after an
outbreak.
As veterinarians, we need to be aware of this public health risk and
be able to educate pet owners. People are travelling with their pets
more and more these days, and bringing them home to cities and
towns with large unvaccinated, stray dog populations.
Please also remind hunters that their dogs, which may come in
contact with Texas' high risk wildlife (coyotes, foxes, skunks,
raccoons, bats), should be currently vaccinated against rabies.
You can visit the zoonosis website for more information about
rabies, or contact one of the Regional Zoonosis Veterinarians to
find out about the rabies epidemiology in your area.
