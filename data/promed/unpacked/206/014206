Foot-and-mouth outbreak confirmed in Russia's south
---------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] at a swine farm in
southern Russia has resulted in the destruction of 204 pigs, the
regional emergency ministry press service said on Thursday [22 Jul
2010].

The carcass of a wild boar, which died of the disease, was discovered
in the area in May [2010], striking concerns of the possible spread
of FMD. Authorities authorized the killing of wild boars in the
region to deter the further spread of the disease to domestic
livestock.

On Wednesday [21 Jul 2010], 2 pigs died at a farm. Laboratory tests
proved the animals died of FMD and the farmer was ordered to destroy
the remaining 204 head of domestic swine.

FMD is passed by direct contact with other animals. Though the
disease poses no threat to humans, it does cause colossal financial
losses among farmers with livestock.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[Rostov on Don, from where the above report originated, is situated
in the Rostov oblast, the Southern Federal District of Russia (South
west Russia); map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map_of_Russia_-_Rostov_Oblast_(2008-03).svg>.

This is the 2nd event, during 2010, when suspected FMD in wildlife,
in Russia, preceded reported outbreaks in domestic stock.

In Feb 2010, ProMED-mail published a RFI concerning suspected FMD in
antelopes in East, Asian Russia (Zabaykalsky krai; see archived
20100202.0354). The media reported that FMD vaccinations in domestic
stock were undertaken, but the RFI remained un-responded. In July
2010, an FMD (serotype O, SEA topotype) outbreak in cattle and swine
in Zabaykalsky krai was officially notified to the OIE.

According to the current report, an FMD-infected wild boar was
discovered in south Russia (exact location not given, but seemingly
in the vicinity of the current outbreak) in a wild boar in May 2010.
Official confirmation, and the genotype of the FMD serotype O virus
strain involved in this outbreak -- reported 2 months later -- are
anticipated.

It will be interesting to note if this strain is related to the SEA
strain which has been reported from Zabaykalsky krai, thousands of
miles away, or to the ME-SA topotype, PanAsia-2 strain, circulating
(2010) in Kazakhstan, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan (see
20100720.2437). The FMDV serotype O, SEA topotype, Mya-98 lineage,
initially identified in Thailand and Malaysia, has been recorded
during 2010 in P.R. China (Hong Kong SAR), Mongolia, Republic of
Korea and Japan, and seems to be spreading, affecting cattle and
swine. This virus is highly suspected to be wide-spread in mainland
China, but genotyping from China is not yet available.

FMFV (serotype O) has been reported in the past to affect wild boars
in northern Israel (see 20070517.1571). This animal deserves
attention as a potential prolific disseminator of the virus. - Mod.AS]
