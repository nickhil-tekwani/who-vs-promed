[2] Treatment guide

Ferreira Barijho SN, Gomez Bareiro VM, Rodriguez Gonzalez H. Contributors: Alvarez Vales AM, Vazquez C, Oviedo E, Von Horoch M, Osorio D. Guia para el manejo clinico de la enfermedad producidanpor el virus del chikungunya (Guidelines for clinical management of the disease produced by the chikungunya virus).

Abstract
Chikungunya fever is an emerging viral disease 1st described in Tanzania in 1952. It is endemic in Asia, Africa and Oceania and in late 2013, began to appear in the Americas, where it has caused epidemics in the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, and Bolivia, among other countries. In Paraguay, the presence of the 2 _Aedes_ mosquito vectors (_Aedes albopictus_ and _Ae. aegypti_) facilitate the transmission and spread of this disease. In February 2015, an outbreak of the disease was detected [in Paraguay] in Fernando de la Mora, Central Department, with 8 positive cases, all native cases. Because of this event, the General Directorate for the Development and Health Services Network of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare has prepared this guide to be used by all health professionals in all health-care facilities in the country.

The document includes epidemiological concepts, clinical aspects of the disease, groups considered most at risk, the differential diagnosis with other diseases, mainly with dengue, laboratory tests and medical treatment, information which will improve the care and the proper approach to patients with chikungunya virus [infections].

Objectives:
- To implement the technical guidelines of the Guide at health-care facilities at all levels (national, regional and local) and
- To ensure proper management of patients with chikungunya virus disease.

Specific objectives:
1. Identify the clinical manifestations, prioritizing critical patients and risk groups.
2. Establish the differential diagnosis with other prevalent diseases, especially dengue.
3. Refer more severe cases and patients at risk of complications to more higher levels of care and to return these patients to the original level and location of care for monitoring once stabilized.

[These guidelines will be of value to health care professionals who treat patients with chikungunya virus infections. It is hoped that this guide will stimulate an open discussion of approaches by those who have had experience treating chikungunya fever patients throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. - Mod.TY]

Jones PH, Okeoma CM. Detection of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in urine of infected mice: a potential non-invasive diagnostic tool for CHIKV.

Abstract
Background: The reemergence of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection and the spread of the virus throughout the world call for a fast, reliable, and improved laboratory diagnostic procedures. The aim of this study was to determine if CHIKV genome is present in other body fluids besides plasma as a tool for developing non-invasive diagnostic method.

Methods: This study utilized a sensitive and less invasive assay that combines the specificity of immunocomplexing and the sensitivity of real-time PCR to detect CHIKV in urine and plasma of infected mice.

Results: CHIKV RNA was detected by immuno-capture-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (IC-qPCR) in urine and plasma of infected mice. Viral RNA was detected in urine up to day 30, long after viral clearance in plasma. Furthermore, infectious CHIKV was detected in urine by cell-based immunofluorescence and 50 percent tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assays, suggesting the presence of infectious virus in urine.

Conclusion: We demonstrate a potential non-invasive diagnostic approach that could be adapted to screen for CHIKV infection in viremic and aviremic patients using urine.

[It will be interesting to see if this method is successful for diagnosing CHIKV infections in people. A distinguished virologist once commented, "mice lie" in reference to extrapolating mouse results to humans. One hopes that this is not the case here. - Mod.TY]

Hartwig A, Bosco-Lauth A, Bowen R. Chikungunya virus in non-mammalian species: a possible new reservoir.

Abstract
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arbovirus distributed widely in tropical regions of the world that causes a febrile and often painful disease in adults and children. Recent outbreaks of CHIKV infection in the Caribbean have raised concerns about establishment of this virus in North America. A significant question about the transmission cycle of CHIKV is whether non-human reservoir hosts are important in maintenance or transmission of the virus. We conducted experimental infections with CHIKV and discovered that several reptiles and amphibians developed viremia of sufficient magnitude to possibly serve as reservoir hosts. One or 2 strains of CHIKV were inoculated into a variety of ball pythons, Burmese pythons, Northern garter snakes, American alligators, green iguanas, painted turtles, leopard frogs, Bufo species toads and cane toads. Viremia was not detected in alligators or cane toads but all other species developed viremia at variable magnitude. Peak viremia in the other species varied from 2.8 (Burmese pythons) to 4.7 (leopard frogs) log10 pfu/ml. We also conducted experiment to evaluate the effect of ambient temperature changes to monitor the "over wintering" capabilities of CHIKV in snakes. Northern garter snakes were inoculated a South African strain of CHIKV at temperatures of 16 C versus 26 C and tested for viremia. The snakes kept at 26 C developed a short term viremia, whereas in snakes kept at 16 C, the virus was maintained for a longer period and viremia titers as high as 7.2 log10 pfu/ml were achieved when animals were subsequently slowly warmed to 26 C.

[These interesting results need to be confirmed by studies in the field to determine if CHIKV infections in reptiles and amphibians occur in nature, and if so, which arthropod vectors are involved. Africa, where CHIKV has been shown over decades to be endemic, would be a good place to start. - Mod.TY]
