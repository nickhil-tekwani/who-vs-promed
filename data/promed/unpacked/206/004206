A mystery fever has played havoc at Mandargarh in Kota [Rajasthan] for
the past few days. Residents of Mandargarh, which is a tribal area in
Mandana, are living in fear as sources claimed that 13 people have
died in the area in the past one month. The medical department claimed
only 5 deaths.

Those who died had symptoms like cough, cold, and running nose,
sources said. Initially, the residents suspected the deaths are due to
chikungunya fever or pneumonia, but the medical and health department
denied this. It was not due to a seasonal disease. Teams have been
sent to investigate, said BR Meena, director of health.

"It is not chikungunya but we have found that patients are also
suffering from anaemia, which shows up in blood tests," GS Sisodiya,
Kota's chief medical and health officer, said. He said the people in
the area are mostly anaemic. Now, the department is distributing iron
and folic acid tablets among the residents of the area.

One person died on Sunday [30 Oct 2011] and 3 others were admitted to
the government hospital in Kota. Also, one child has been referred to
JK Lone Hospital in Jaipur, an official said.

The situation worsened as there is no medical department's sub-centre
in the area. The area is neglected in terms of medical facilities.
Mandargarh has a population of around 950 and most of them are mine
labourers.

Now, to control the damage, the medical and health department has set
up a temporary dispensary at a school. "We have sent a team of
doctors, so that the patients with fever could get immediate medical
help," Sisodiya said. Also, teams of doctors made a door-to-door
survey to find out new patients. Moreover, the department also claimed
that 3 people have died last week [week of 24 Oct 2011] and one of
them died of tuberculosis.

[The symptoms of the disease associated with these fatalities in Kota,
the number of which is disputed, are not described clearly enough to
suggest an etiology. Anemia is prevalent in the community suggesting
malnutrition may be a factor. Chikungunya fever and a seasonal illness
have been excluded. Fever and respiratory symptoms may be common
features suggesting a respiratory infection. Further information from
the region is requested.

Kota is located along eastern bank of the Chambal River in the
southern part of the state if Rajasthan. It is the 3rd largest city of
Rajasthan after Jaipur and Jodhpur. Its location can be found on the
