FMD update: further tests confirm FMD at slaughter on suspicion site in Surrey
--------------------------------------------------
Foot and mouth disease (FMD) has today [18 Sep 2007] been confirmed at the
slaughter on suspicion premises where sheep, pigs, and cattle were culled
last night [17 Sep 2007]. This now becomes the 5th Infected Premises since
3 Aug 2007.
When the animals were examined at slaughter they showed FMD lesions.
Results of further laboratory tests are awaited.
The farm is within the existing Protection Zone near to the Infected
Premises confirmed last week [10-16 Sep 2007].
Minor changes have now been made to the Protection Zones (PZ) and
Surveillance Zone (SZ) in the area.
The new zones, [including map], can be found at

Tests on cattle at a 3rd Surrey farm have tested positive for FMD, it has
been confirmed. Livestock on the farm, which lies within an existing 3 km
(1.8-mile) protection zone in the Egham area, are being culled as a precaution.
The disease was confirmed in slaughtered cattle at 2 other farms in the
same area last week [10-16 Sep 2007].
Initial tests on pigs culled on a 4th farm in the same area tested negative
for FMD.
The 3 latest confirmed cases were just a few miles away from the Pirbright
research complex -- blamed as the source for the FMD outbreaks at 2 other
farms last month [August 2007].
The new cases are also believed to involve the same strain of the disease
found in the outbreaks last month [August 2007].
On Saturday [15 Sep 2007], the government's chief vet lifted a ban on
farmers across most of England from taking livestock to slaughter. But
livestock can still not be traded or moved for any other reason.
A full ban on any movement remains in place in the surveillance zone around
the 2 infected sites in Surrey [see comment].
A 3 km (1.8 mile) protection zone has been set up around the farmland, with
a 10 km (6.2 mile) surveillance zone encircling it.

Another outbreak of FMD in cattle on a Surrey farm has been announced by
the Government today [18 Sep 2007].
The cattle had lesions displaying clear symptoms of the disease when they
were slaughtered on The Klondyke, a 20 acre (8 hectares) Virginia Water
farm. Blood samples from the animals are nevertheless being tested for
conclusive evidence.
There were thought to be relatively few movements of animals on and off the
farm, so vets are hopeful that they can easily track the movement of the virus.
Sheep on the same farm were slaughtered last night [17 Sep 2007] on
suspicion of carrying FMD, though there were no visible symptoms of
disease. Further tests are being carried to establish if they were
infected. Similar test results on pigs kept on the premises are also
awaited. The owners were too upset to speak about the disease. The
smallholding has been in [their family] for about 100 years.
The farm is in the original protection zone and is a mile (1.6 km) from
Stroude Farm, also in Virginia Water, where disease in cattle was confirmed
on Friday [14 Sep 2007]. Lesions on the cattle at this farm were 10 days
old, suggesting that the virus had been on the farm for about 2 weeks
without being spotted.
News that sheep were likely to have the disease triggered alarm in farming
circles for the disease is notoriously difficult to detect in the species.
One of the possible reasons for the re-emergence of the virus 4 days after
the UK was declared disease-free is that it was being spread in sheep.
Sheep with infection often show no symptoms of FMD, and even if they have
ulcers in the mouth this could be caused by a common disease, orf. [The
commonest clinical manifestation of FMD in adult sheep is lameness. In
young lambs, sudden mortality due to heart lesions may occur. - Mod.AS]
Government vets are treating the new wave of the disease as an extension of
the August [2007] outbreak in the Surrey village of Normandy, and
officially the latest infected farm is the 5th outbreak.
The disease in the Klondyke cattle has led government vets to believe that
the outbreak is still one of cattle, and that the spread to other animals
has occurred only after a movement of cattle, people, vehicles, or farm
equipment in the area. Veterinary epidemiologists are tracing all movements
in an attempt to establish the route and source of the resurgence of the
virus in Surrey.

[On Tue 18 Sep 2007, Dr Debby Reynolds, director general & chief veterinary
officer, UK, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA),
director general for Animal Health & Welfare, submitted to the OIE (Office
International des Epizooties; World Organisation for Animal Health) the 6th
follow up report on the FMD outbreak which, reportedly, started on 29 Jul
2007 and was 1st confirmed on 3 Aug 2007. The current report deals with
outbreak "FMD 2007/3", in Egham, Surrey, England, starting 11 Sep 2007.
Reportedly, there were 47 susceptible animals of which there were 9 cases;
all 47 were destroyed.
The report includes the following description of the affected population:
"beef suckler herd comprising main farm and 7 detached grazings. Disease
has so far been confirmed on one of the detached grazings."
For the report above, which includes a map, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6200>.
The fact that the affected herd comprised grazing sucklers may explain why
the disease was not detected during its earlier stages; milking cows would
have shown clearer and more severe symptoms, and are approached at least
twice daily.
Follow up reports of the 2 new outbreaks, FMD 2007/4 and 2007/5, discovered
since the outbreak above, and particularly the descriptions of their
respective affected populations, are anticipated.
To appreciate the importance of strict enforcement of the full ban on any
animal movement within the current surveillance zone, subscribers are
advised to view the map presented in the BBC News URL above. 2 major
highways, the M3 and the M25, cross the surveillance zone; the zone is
adjacent to Heathrow international airport. - Mod.AS]
