The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has confirmed an additional 3 human

during the last 2 weeks of May 2005. All 3 patients are from Hanoi and
remain alive. No further data about these cases have been provided.
The newly confirmed cases bring the total, in Viet Nam, since mid-December
2004 to 55 cases. Of these patients, 18 have died and 3 are currently
undergoing treatment at a hospital in Hanoi.

[This update resolves a discrepancy between the previous WHO Update (see:
Avian influenza, human - East Asia (82): Viet Nam 20050608.1592) and
subsequent statements from the Vietnamese Ministry of Health concerning the
date of detection of the 3 most recent human cases of H5N1 avian influenza
in Viet Nam. The 2 sources are now in agreement -- that the 3 most recent
human cases in Viet Nam were detected during the last 2 weeks of May. - Mod.CP]
