Dozens of racing thoroughbreds have been struck down by a mystery respiratory infection sweeping through some of the country's top stables.

Trainers have described the outbreak of infection, which leads to horses suffering from cough and runny eyes, as the worst they have seen in decades.

The revelations coincided with Saturday and Sunday's [17-18 Sep 2016] Newmarket Open Weekend, when 15 stables were lined up to open their doors to members of the public, leading to fears that large numbers of people moving from one to another could lead to a further spread in infections.

Stables have been advised by organisers to take a series of precautionary bio-security measures to reduce the risk.

These include roping off the front of boxes so members of the public cannot get too close to the horses; providing disinfection foot baths or mats at each entrance to the yard and placing senior staff around the stables to monitor the public around the horses.

Stables and estates have also been offered supplies of disinfectant sachets to help staff and visitors reduce the danger of carrying any infection from one animal to another.

Newmarket, home to around 3000 race horses, has been the worst hit, although illness has also spread to across the Channel to Chantilly, the centre of racing in France.

Several trainers have reported that their horses have been "out of sorts," leading them to carry out blood tests on their animals.

These have confirmed they were suffering from some form of respiratory infection, although the precise strain has yet to be identified.

The rash of infections forced trainers to pull several of their horses out of races this summer [2016] in order for them to have time to recuperate.

The most high-profile case was that of Postponed -- one of Britain's best older males -- who was unable to defend his King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot in July 2016 due to respiratory problems.

He went on to recover fully and win the Juddmonte International at York Racecourse on 17 Aug 2016.

Postponed's trainer Roger Varian put out half the number of runners in July 2016 that he did in May and June 2016, while Saeed Bin Suroor, another high profile trainer, withdrew all his horses during July 2016, sending them out again only in late August 2016.

Mr Bin Suroor said: "We've given the horses an easy time. Most have been coughing. You can see it all over Newmarket. I've been here 22 years, and this is the worst thing like that to happen here. You have to stop and give them time to recover."

Mr Varian added: "It's like humans. You can feel all right with a lung infection until your lungs start burning, then you can forget it. If you run them when they're sick they take longer to recover."

Angus Gold, racing manager at Shadwell stud in Norfolk, who manages 350 horses for Sheikh Hamdam Al Maktoum, said: "I don't think people have realised quite what a difficult year this has been for horse-health issues and just what a tough time trainers have had. It has been the worst year in my 30 years as racing manager."

He added: "Not everyone is affected, but it is a Europe-wide problem."

Jenny Hall, the chief veterinary officer of the British Horseracing Authority, told The Telegraph: "They normally build up immunity during the winter. They get a bit of a cold and take a bit of time off, just like we do, then they get over it.

"But it may be relevant that this year [2016] they've remained reasonably healthy throughout the winter, and it has eventually caught up with them. They've not had the opportunity to build up that immunity ahead of a more recent colder period."

Ms Hall said that younger race horses, known as yearlings, were also likely to have spread the infection when mixing with others after being moved to trainers' stables, just as children do when 1st starting school.

"It's a reminder how important hygiene is in stables and how difficult it is, as well as at the races, with horses constantly coming and going," she said.

Researchers at the Animal Health Trust laboratories are currently trying to identify the strain of the disease, though it is not thought to have any long term effect on the animal's health.

Teddy Grimthorpe, racing manager for Prince Khalid Abdullah's string of thoroughbreds, told The Racing Post: "It's been a real problem this year [2016], no question. I think it's a Europe-wide problem. It's been bad in Chantilly, and there certainly have been spells when various Newmarket trainers have struggled.

"It doesn't seem like it's one thing; there seems to be so many different strains of flu or rhino flu. I think it's a perfect storm of a number of things."

[The report mentions blood tests "which have confirmed ... some form of respiratory infection, although the precise strain has yet to be identified." The racing manager for Prince Khalid Abdullah's string of thoroughbreds refers to "so many different strains of flu or rhino flu," namely equine influenza or equine rhinopneumonitis (aka equine herpes virus). Clear results of the lab tests are essential for its efficient handling. - Mod.AS
