Review of outbreaks and barriers to MMR vaccination coverage among hard to reach populations in European countries
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are recognised hard-to-reach population groups within Europe who have a disproportionate risk of measles susceptibility due to under-vaccination with the MMR vaccine. These include migrants and nomadic groups, immigrants, religious groups, anthroposophic groups, complementary medicine users and health care workers. Across Europe, the review identifies that national immunisation programmes lack adequate information to monitor vaccination coverage in these hard-to-reach population groups, since few countries collect information on ethnic, religious and migrant status.

When reported in the literature, vaccination coverage was generally low and varied greatly, with a range of 7 to 46 percent for religious groups; 0.6 to 65 percent for anthroposophic groups and 0 to 82 percent for nomadic groups (Travellers and Roma). The list of barriers includes discrimination; administrative and financial problems; language or literacy limitations; lack of cultural knowledge; lack of knowledge on health and vaccination; religious reasons; a fatalistic approach to life and a distorted risk perception in relation to vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases among some individuals and groups.

Addressing MMR under-vaccination is the responsibility of every national authority, and every health professional working in the area of disease prevention and health promotion. MMR vaccination coverage needs to be monitored within each population group at risk of under-vaccination. Improving access to health services is critical in order to ensure that vaccination is available to those who need it.

Measles cases have soared in Central Lancashire
-----------------------------------------
The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has revealed there were 865 laboratory confirmed cases of the highly infectious viral illness in the North West in 2012, compared to just 52 the year before. In Central Lancashire alone, there were 35 cases last year, compared to only 3 in 2011.

Measles was rare in the UK, due to immunisation, however, there were 2016 confirmed cases in England and Wales reported to the HPA in 2012, which is the highest annual total since 1994. This has been associated with prolonged outbreaks in Merseyside, Surrey, and Sussex, as well as several smaller outbreaks in travelling communities.

The worst hit area in the North West was Merseyside, with 313 cases. This was followed by Knowsley with 95 and Sefton with 72, then Bolton with 69, Ashton, Leigh and Wigan with 37 and Central Lancashire with 35.

Warning as measles cases increase
-----------------------------
Parents in South Tyneside are being urged to vaccinate their children as cases of measles continue to rise. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) says that since September [2012], 82 confirmed cases and 73 suspected cases of the illness have been reported. These include 19 confirmed and 10 suspected cases in the past week.

HPA immunisation lead Julia Waller said: "There is no treatment for measles but it can be prevented by the MMR vaccine, and 2 doses are required to ensure the best protection." That's why we're urging parents to make sure that their children are fully immunised and have had 2 doses of the jab. "In fact, anyone who is unsure about their own immunisation status should do the same."

Measles claims one more in Hoima, brings death toll to 5
------------------------------------------------
The death toll of people who have succumbed to measles in Hoima has increased to 5, following the death of a 3-year-old at the weekend, district officials have said. The district health inspector, Mr Fredrick Byenume, said his office had recorded a total of 141 cases since measles broke out 2 months ago in Kabwooya Sub-county.

The area district councillor, Mr Vincent Opio, said there were more people dying in communities with symptoms similar to measles. Mr Opio said Sayuni, Kabegaramire, Nyairongo, Rwenkobe, Ibahura, Karokarungi, Dongo, Rwengabi and Nyakabaale villages were between 5 to 14 kilometres away from the centre, the only government facility in Kaseeta parish treating measles case. "People are having difficulty to access Kaseeta Health Centre which is about 5 to 10 kilometres away from various villages," he said. Mr Opio said residents wondered why the government had not yet conducted a mass immunisation drive in the area. "Schools have opened. Children, who may be infected with the disease, could be mixing with those who have yet to contract the epidemic. This may worsen the infection rates," he said.

Mr Byenume, however, said plans were underway to start a mass immunisation outreach in the affected communities starting this weekend. The measles epidemic, which broke out in this district in January in Kabwooya, is reportedly spreading to neighbouring Kiziranfumbi and Kyangwali sub-counties.

Medical experts say all measles patients are below 5 years of age. The epidemic has so far claimed 3 children between the ages of 2 and 10 and a 35-year-old resident of Nyanseke Village.

Measles outbreak blamed on 'missed opportunities'
-------------------------------------------
A joint mission of World Health Organisation (WHO), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) on Friday [15 Feb 2013] concluded that the high incidence of measles across the country was a result of missed opportunities, specifically the failure to vaccinate children routinely and reach them through supplementary immunisation activities (SIAs). A 4-member joint mission including Dr Nadia Teleb, Regional Advisor from Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), Dr Robert Kezaala, Measles Focal Point at UNICEF headquarters, Selenge Lkhagva, UNICEF Supply Division and Anne Cronin, Senior Programme Officer of the GAVI Secretariat in Switzerland, arrived in Pakistan on Tue 12 Feb 2013 on a 4-day visit to review the current measles situation and recommend actions to control measles outbreaks in Pakistan.

Concerned departments continue to falsely report high coverage of routine immunisation services. The coverage reports were proven wrong by local independent surveys carried out in all provinces. The surveys gave a clear picture of immunisation service coverage, indicating lower coverage of a 1st and 2nd dose of the measles vaccine in various provinces. These findings were revealed by the joint mission during a high level meeting held at the National Institute of Health (NIH) with officials of the federal and provincial Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) officials and other departments concerned.

The mission further revealed that even the coverage of measles supplementary immunisation activities (SIAs) from 2010-2012 across the country were reported as high, yet the incidence of measles remains high and 50 percent cases indicate zero doses of the vaccine, which proves the numbers incorrect.

The joint mission gave its recommendations to control the outbreak of measles, including: strengthening routine immunisation by ensuring ownership, accountability at all levels, strengthening reporting, monitoring and a supervision system in line with the national EPI policy and improved access to quality service delivery and vaccine management system.

142 new cases of measles reported in Punjab province
----------------------------------------------
The Health Department of the Punjab government has said that 142 more cases of measles have been reported in the province, a private news channel reported on Tuesday [12 Feb 2013]. Out of the 142 cases, at least 50 patients were reported from Lahore. The overall toll has mounted to 3678 in the province so far.

Measles is caused by measles virus, a single-stranded, negative-sense enveloped RNA virus classified the genus _Morbillivirus_ within the family _Paramyxoviridae_. Humans are the natural hosts of the virus; no animal reservoirs are known to exist. This highly contagious virus is spread by coughing and sneezing via close personal contact or direct contact with secretions.

Measles case from China confirmed
------------------------------
Heath authorities have confirmed the 1st case this year of measles contracted overseas -- an 8-month-old girl who returned from China this month [February]. The baby developed a rash and fever late last month during a trip to Hunan Province with her mother to visit relatives, Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Deputy Director-General Chou Jih-haw said. When the child and mother returned to Taiwan on 2 Feb 2013, an alert was triggered on the airport's body temperature equipment and the baby was subsequently hospitalized and quarantined, Chou said.The baby is recovering, the centers said. [This case was initially reported in part (9) Measles update (05)]. Health authorities have been tracking the other passengers who were on the flight from China and monitoring the staff at the hospital that admitted the child, but there have been no other cases of measles so far, the CDC said.

There were 1502 confirmed cases of measles in [Mainland?] China last month, more than 3.5 times the number for the same month last year, according to the CDC. Visits to areas where measles is common are not advisable for children younger than a year old, Chou said, but if such visits are necessary, the children should be vaccinated before travel. The government provides free vaccinations against measles, mumps and rubella for children one-year-old or older.

[It is reassuring to learn that although this case of measles was detected in initially by an airport thermal body scanner, there appears to have been no onward transmission of the virus infection either to passengers and crew, or to airport ground staff.
