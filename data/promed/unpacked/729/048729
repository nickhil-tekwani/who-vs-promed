On Wednesday, El Salvador Ministry of Agriculture and Ranching confirmed
the detection of avian influenza [virus infection in the zones bordering
Guatemala. Salvadoran and Honduran technicians are inspecting the large
export farms. The Minister of Agriculture, Salvador Urrutia, assured the
presence of the virus will not affect meat and egg commerce because it
doesn't affect human consumption.
He explained the outbreaks of avian influenza were detected in "backyard"
birds [informal household farming and said the disease had not been in the
large chicken and egg exportation farms. He emphasized this does not mean
the backyard birds or those in the export farms are dying as a result of
the avian influenza.
Although the virus detected is not lethal to the birds and, therefore,
there is no indication for a restrictive barrier for commerce with
Honduras, Urrutia believes the country needs to know the strain [of virus
responsible for the avian influenza. Although the virulence of the variant
[of influenza virus hasn't been determined as yet, according to Urrutia it
is most likely of low pathogenicity, similar to the virus detected in
Guatemala.
The Salvadoran announcement came as representatives of El Salvador and
Honduras decided to inspect their bird-raising and milk products, as the
first step in an agreement to restore the commerce between the nations. The
inspection will be verified and guaranteed by the International Regional
Organism of Agricultural and Farming Health (OIRSA) and according to the
agreement, farms that are negative [for presence of the avian virus will
be able to resume their exports without any problems.

[The change in policy and concern must be due to a mutual resolution of the
trade barriers between the countries involved. Previously, they were
concerned because the avian influenza had traversed the species barrier
into humans in China. If this outbreak is contained in small flocks and
does not reach the commercial flocks, perhaps the risk is less than it was
in China. Â­ Mod.TG
