EC STOPS IMPORT OF ALL CATS FROM AUSTRALIA;
DOGS & CATS FROM MALAYSIA UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE
[Letter to all authorised quarantine premises in England and Wales
Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food
20 August 1999
Dear Sir/Madam:
New measures adopted by the European Commission Hendra and
Nipah disease.
In Australia and Malaysia (Peninsula):
1. Fatal cases of Hendra and Nipah disease in humans have
been declared in Australia and Malaysia. The Commission have
determined that Member States shall not permit the importation of:
- fruit bats of the genus _Pteropus_ from Malaysia (Peninsula) and
Australia unless free of Hendra and Nipah disease; and
- dogs and cats from Malaysia (Peninsula) unless free of Nipah
disease; and
- cats from Australia unless free of Hendra disease unless these
animals are certified as free from the appropriate disease(s).
These restrictions have been implemented today in England and
Wales by a Declaration issued Under Regulation 27 of the Animals
and Animal Products (import and Export) Regulations 1998. A
copy is attached for information. A similar Declaration applies to
Scotland.
2. No certification is available from the Australian or Malaysian
authorities. This therefore means that with effect from 18.00 hours
today the importation of the above species from Australia and
Malaysia (Peninsula) is prohibited,
3. Any licences granted for the import of such species into
England and Wales from these countries is hereby revoked.
4. The lifting of this prohibition is receiving urgent attention and
you will be advised as and when it is lifted. If this prohibition is
lifted, your license will be reinstated; and you will not need to
reapply.
Contact point for enquiries: (England and Wales) Mr. Andrew
Baxter (Tel: 0181 330 8177, fax: 0181 330 9232) or (Scotland)
