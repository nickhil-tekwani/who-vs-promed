On 25 Jul 2007, 4 new cases of polio were confirmed in Equateur
province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, bringing the total
number of cases in the country this year [2007] to 27. In
neighbouring Angola, advance notification of 2 new polio cases was
received, which will bring the total number of cases in Angola in
2007 to 8. The 2 cases are from Luanda and Benguele provinces.
Both countries are continuing synchronized, cross-border outbreak
response activities. Large-scale, supplementary immunization
activities (SIAs) were launched nationwide in Angola, and in the
affected areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Equateur and
Bandundu provinces) on [25 Jul 2007], to reach more than 8 million
children under the age of 5 years. Further immunization campaigns
will be conducted later in the year.
In 2005, poliovirus of Indian origin re-infected Angola before
subsequently spreading to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2006.

[According to the polio eradication website, the dates of onset of
the most recent wild polio virus (WPV) isolate are 13 Jun 2007 for
the Angola cases and 7 Jun 2007 for the Democratic Republic of the
Congo cases (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf>. The
data presented are current as of 24 Jul 2007 and do not include 2
additional cases reported from Angola). In both countries, WPV type 1
is the only WPV type isolated in these outbreaks.
Polio was reintroduced to Angola in 2005. At that time, the WPV
identified associated with the outbreak was genetically similar to
viruses circulating in India. Since 2005, there have been a total of
20 cases of WPV associated disease in Angola. When polio was
reintroduced into the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2006, it
was stated to be related to the ongoing transmission in Angola (see
prior ProMED-mail postings listed below). Since 2006, there have been
a total of 44 cases of WPV associated disease in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.
It would be of interest to know whether the recent WPV 1 isolates
from both countries are descendents of the WPV 1 that originally
originated in India in 2005, or whether they are descendents of WPVs
circulating elsewhere in Africa, with origins from Nigeria.

On [11 Jul 2007], 2 polio cases were reported from Chad, one of which
was in the east of the country, close to the border with Darfur,
Sudan. In May 2004, poliovirus originating in northern Nigeria in
this same area spread into Darfur, leading to a major outbreak across
Sudan, and which subsequently re-infected further countries,
including Yemen and Indonesia. Urgent efforts are underway to
minimise the risk of further polio spread from Chad, as Chad and
Sudan are planning an extensive, cross-border emergency outbreak
response. The risk of polio spread could be further compounded by the
upcoming Omra season (beginning in September 2007) and its large
population movements. These latest cases further underline the risk
polio continues to pose to polio-free countries around the world
until the disease has been eradicated in the remaining endemic hotspots.

[Additional information from the polio eradication website is that
the date of onset of the most recent WPV type 1 case (as of 24 Jul
2007) was 28 May 2007; see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf>.
In addition, Chad will conduct its 1st NIDs (National Immunization
Days) on [3-5 Aug 2007] as part of emergency outbreak activities in
response to the recent confirmation of 2 cases. Sudan will
synchronize its supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) as part
of urgent, internationally-coordinated efforts to minimise the risk
of further polio spread from Chad. Further campaigns are planned for
September [2007] (from <http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>).
