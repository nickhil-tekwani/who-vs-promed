The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported [28 Mar 2019] that another horse in Maricopa County, Arizona, has been diagnosed with equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM), the neurologic form of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1).

A 20-year-old Quarter Horse mare developed severe neurologic signs on 25 Mar 2019 and was ultimately euthanized, the EDCC said. Test results confirmed EHV-1 infection on [27 Mar 2019].

The Arizona Department of Agriculture said this case is not associated with the one confirmed in the same county earlier this week [week of 25 Mar 2019], the EDCC added.

EHV 101
Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM.

In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or the clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help present disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

[Sadly, it seems like we are seeing a lot of this disease.

A thorough explanation of EHV may be found in ProMED-mail post: Equine herpesvirus - North America (05): USA (NV) horse 20190321.6380047.

From the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP):
None of the available vaccines have a label claim to prevent the neurologic form of EHV-1 infection. It has been suggested that vaccines may assist in limiting the spread of outbreaks of EHM by limiting nasal shedding of EHV-1 and dissemination of infection. For this reason, some experts hold the opinion that there may be an advantage to vaccinating in the face of an outbreak. If this approach is pursued, only afebrile and asymptomatic horses should be vaccinated, and protection against clinical EHM should not be an expectation. The vaccines with the greatest ability to limit nasal shedding and viremia of the neuro virulent strain include the vaccines licensed for control of abortion (Pneumabort-K and Prodigy) and the MLV vaccine (Rhinomune and Calvenza).

More information on vaccine schedules is available on the AAEP home page where most of this information was extracted from:
