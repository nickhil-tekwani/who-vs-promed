Blast Disease Threatens Vietnam's Rice Crops
-----------------------------------------------
HANOI: Blast disease is threatening Vietnam's winter-spring rice crops
nationwide, the local daily Vietnam News reported Tue 13 Feb 2001. From
late January 2001, Vietnam's northern provinces have been hit by cold
weather, coupled with light rains to create ideal conditions for blast
disease to develop.
Meanwhile, wet weather in the central and southern areas may also encourage
the disease in the regions. As of 8 Feb 2001, blast disease has appeared in
the country's northern provinces of Bac Giang, Bac Ninh, Hoa Binh and Ha
Nam. The disease has also been recorded in Khanh Hoa and Da Nang provinces
in the central area of the country, and Can Tho, Kien Giang, Soc Trang,
Dong Thap, Vinh Long, Tien Giang in the South.
The Vietnamese Plant Protection Bureau has issued a warning to farmers
countrywide to prepare for blast disease affecting their winter-spring rice
crops. The bureau has also asked farmers to check fields frequently in
order to spot the disease early. The Agricultural Encouragement Department,
under Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, has given
guidelines to farmers on how to protect winter-spring rice crops with
further cold weather predicted.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe grisea_ (anamorph
_Pyricularia grisea_). It is considered by many to be the most important
disease of rice worldwide. The disease has been reported in at least 85
countries. According to the daily newspaper Viet Nam News, the northern
province of Lai Chau has planted more than 5500 hectares of the
winter-spring rice, an increase of 1500 hectares over last year. Farmers in
some areas are covering up rows of seedlings with nylon to conserve heat
and to prevent rat infestation. - Mod.DH
