Malaria epidemic in Assam
-------------------------------
At least 25 people have died of malaria and more than 10 000 have been
affected, with the disease assuming epidemic proportions in Assam, health
officials said on Friday [3 Jun 2005].
"A maximum alert has been sounded across Assam, and medical teams are
working overtime to check a malaria epidemic in the region," a health
official said. At least 15 of the fatalities were reported from eastern
Assam's Karbi Anglong district during the past week. "We have reports of
malaria deaths from other parts of the state as well, although the
situation in Karbi Anglong district is serious," the official said.
Experts say heavy rains in the past fortnight in Assam had led to the
outbreak of malaria. Doctors say the initial symptoms of malaria are high
fever and chills, and at times diarrhea and stomach ache as well.
"Villagers often bring patients to the hospital very late, when chances of
survival are very remote. There is still a great deal of ignorance about
the fatal consequences of malaria," said Dhiren Nath, a local doctor in
Karbi Anglong. The northeast is a known "malaria zone," with the disease
claiming an estimated 500 lives annually. At least 2000 health workers,
including doctors and paramedics, are being rushed to malaria-prone areas
to prevent the disease from spreading. "We have enough anti-malarial drugs,
and our doctors are conducting camps to collect blood samples for tests and
take remedial measures," Assam Health Minister Bhumidhar Barman said.
Health workers are cleaning swampy areas across Assam and spraying
disinfectants to kill mosquitoes.

[_Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria is common in Assam, and we presume that
the outbreak is caused by _P. falciparum_. Malaria transmission in Assam is
unstable, which results in regular outbreaks like the one reported by
ProMED in 2001/02. There are also increasing problems with chloroquine
resistance in the state, and apart from increased transmission as discussed
in the article, increasing resistance to chloroquine without a switch to
2nd-line drugs, like mefloquine (Lariam) and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine
(Fansidar), could also be a factor in the mortalities. - Mod.EP]
