[A baby] almost died after contracting an infection passed to her in the saliva of the family's ginger tomcat, Chesney.

A mum told today [17 Apr 2014] how her baby daughter nearly died from meningitis after being infected by the family's pet cat. The girl was just 3 weeks old when she was rushed to hospital with a high temperature and sickness. She was left fighting for life in an isolation unit after it was confirmed she was suffering from meningitis.

Doctors later told her frantic mum that tests showed the infection had been passed to her daughter in the saliva of their ginger tomcat Chesney. Mum-of-one, aged 21, said: "I was just really, really surprised when the doctors said she caught it from the cat; I didn't have a clue it was possible.

"For the 1st couple of days we feared the worst because [she] was so unwell. About 5 days later, the doctors asked if we had any pets. I said we had a cat. They explained to us that [her] illness had been caused by a bug carried by bacteria in the cat's saliva. It took them a while to find out what it was, because they had never seen it before. The doctor said that from the swab they had, there was a bug that grew, and they didn't know what it was. It turned out it was in cats, dogs, rabbits, and pigs; it was in their saliva and really rare. The doctors said there were only 39 recorded cases in the world, and most involved newborn babies because they didn't have an immune system. I was told that she could have died within hours if I hadn't brought her in. They thought the bug was transferred through Chesney's saliva. I'd been careful not to leave them alone together, but Chesney must have licked [her] milk bottle while my back was turned."

"When Sparkle began to improve she had to go and have her bones checked because the doctors said in half the cases, people later suffered a bone disease. I didn't really let Chesney near her when she was tiny. But I was breast-feeding and bottle feeding, and he must have licked her milk bottle or my hand. The cat did have a thing about going for her bottle to get at the milk; it's just a cat thing isn't it."

"[She] spent about 3 weeks in hospital, and then we had to take her back every day for a week to take antibiotics. Fortunately, she made a full recovery. The cat was never unwell; it was just a natural bacteria in his saliva."

[The girl] is now aged 3 and learning to ride a pony.

The terrifying episode unfolded shortly after [the mother] gave birth to her only child at the age of 18. She and [the baby]'s dad were at home at 7 pm one evening when their baby suddenly became very unwell. [The mother], from Winsham, Somerset, said: "She was restless and had a very high temperature and wouldn't stop crying. It was a very piercing cry, and she then started being sick. I thought she had colic and sent [my husband] down to Tesco to get some colic drops. She didn't have a rash but was really, really hot and we gave her a bath to cool her down because she loved a bath." But [the baby] became more unwell, and the couple wrapped her in a blanket and went to Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton after phoning NHS Direct.

Her mother decided not to have 2-year-old Chesney put down after [her baby] recovered from the life-threatening illness. Instead, she gave the cat to her mum who lives 4 miles away. [Her mother] said: "I used to worry about Sparkle at 1st and didn't let her near any animals for more than a year. But it was not Chesney's fault; he didn't mean to do it. I'd had him since he was a kitten; he was like my 1st baby, and I couldn't have put him down. We asked the doctors if we should get rid of the cat, and they said it wasn't really necessary. Now the baby is more immune to it than us because she has all the antibodies." Sparkle now plays with Chesney every time she visits her grandmother's home in Chard.

A spokeswoman for Musgrove Park Hospital today [17 Apr 2014] confirmed Sparkle was treated at the facility 3 years ago.

[The above news report describes acute meningitis in a 3-week-old baby that was attributed to a pathogen found normally in cat saliva. The news report, unfortunately, fails to mention what that pathogen was, except to say that it was a rare cause of meningitis: "...only 39 recorded cases in the world and most involved newborn babies because they didn't have an immune system."

Possible pathogens in cat's saliva can be inferred from those isolated in cat bite infections. Anywhere from 20-80 percent of cat bites may become infected. _Pasteurella_, a Gram-negative coccobacillus that resembles _Hemophilus influenzae_, is the organism most commonly found in cat bite wound infections, with _Pasteurella multocida_ being the predominant _Pasteurella_ species; various viridans _Streptococci_ and _Streptococcus agalactiae_ (also known as Group B beta-hemolytic streptococci or GBS) are the 2nd most common type of organisms isolated (http://cmr.asm.org/content/24/2/231.full). (_Streptococcus pyogenes_, also known as Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, has not been isolated in cat bite wound infections.) Less frequently encountered aerobic organisms in cat bite infections include _Capnocytophaga_ species. Cats are also the main reservoir of _Bartonella henselae_, the causative agent of cat scratch disease, which is found in cat saliva.

_Pasteurella multocida_ has been implicated as a rare cause of bacterial meningitis. Most of these meningitis patients had an animal contact, and many were newborns (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2425895/, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19730153, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17055368, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17206557 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8666850). Meningitis in these patients can be complicated by osteomyelitis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12878338).

_S. agalactiae_ (GBS) is a major cause infection of the newborn; early-onset disease occurring in the 1st week of life is septicemia accompanied by pneumonia, while late-onset disease is septicemia more often accompanied by meningitis (http://www.cdc.gov/groupbstrep/about/newborns-pregnant.html). GBS thus cannot be considered a rare cause of meningitis.

_Capnocytophaga_ cause overwhelming sepsis in asplenic patients, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. About 20 patients with _Capnoytophaga_ meningitis have been described in the medical literature, but the age range has been 17-83 years (mean, 50.6 years) (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/36/3/e42.full.pdf).

_Bartonella henselae_ has not been shown to cause bacterial meningitis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12051353, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8562744). Anaerobic bacteria, although common in cat saliva and cat bite wound infections, are very rarely the cause of acute bacterial meningitis without identifiable risk factors (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC268396/?page=1, http://anaerobicinfections.blogspot.com/p/central-nervous-system-infections.html).

Cat and other feline bites and exposures can also transmit to humans _Francisella tularensis_, the cause of tularemia, _Yersinia pestis_, the cause of plague, and _Mycobacterium bovis_, which can cause human tuberculosis (ProMED-mail post Bovine tuberculosis, human - UK: (England) 2013, domestic cat-to-human transm. 20140327.2361967). Although these organisms can cause meningitis, they would not be described as normal flora in cats' saliva.

So my vote is for _Pasteurella multocida_ as the etiologic agent in this child's meningitis. More specific information about the etiology of meningitis in this case would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
