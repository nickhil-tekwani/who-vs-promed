The Animal Husbandry Department in the state [Kerala] has reported the death of 2 wild buffaloes from foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) at Kundala Dam.

Department sources said the wild animals were at risk of contracting FMD, which may prove fatal.

The outbreak is most likely to affect ungulates, wildlife experts said.

A total of 4 wild buffaloes died in October [2013] due to FMD; another 2 instances of gaur deaths owing to acute FMD were reported from the Kottayam region last week [9-15 Dec 2013].

Experts fear the disease has spread to wild populations. According to them, the presence of cattle in forest areas and its fringes was a matter of grave concern, and imposing restriction on grazing would not be possible.

The Wildlife Division of the Kerala Agricultural University said 2-hoofed herbivorous mammals, namely wild boar, mouse deer, spotted deer, sambar, barking deer, gaur and Nilgiri Tahr were susceptible to the epidemic.

FMD or hoof-and-mouth disease is an infectious and sometimes fatal viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals including domestic and wild bovids.

Wild elephant populations were also vulnerable to the disease; 2 cases of captive elephants which contracted the disease from cattle were reported, one from Thrissur and other from Kottayam [both in Kerala state].

[With some minor exceptions, FMD affects members of the order Arthiodactyla, i.e., all cloven-hoofed animals including domestic and wild ruminants and pigs. Although they do not appear to be suitable reservoirs, some wild ungulates are frequently infected and may play a role in the epidemiology of the disease, such as is the case of Impala and Kudu in Africa, saiga antelope and gazelles in Asia.
