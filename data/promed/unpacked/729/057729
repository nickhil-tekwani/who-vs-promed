Australia has been warned that its 20 million wild pigs would make it
almost impossible to eradicate foot and mouth disease (FMD) if it ever
entered the country.
Dr Tony English of the University of Sydney says wild pigs would be
extremely susceptible to the pan-Asian strain of the disease. Dr English
indicated history has shown it's not possible to completely cull the animals.
He said, "The strategy is to prevent it from coming in and if it does, then
to contain it quickly. I don't like the word disaster but it would be not a
pretty sight. If we lose the initial battle and it does get away from the
initial farm or 2, then there are going to be major difficulties and some
very hard decisions to be made in how we manage it."
"Feral pigs are the big issue as they are very susceptible to the disease.
They are very much an amplifying host, spreading the disease very quickly.
There are probably up to 20 million feral pigs in [Australia] and if [FMD]
gets away from the initial site of entry and into those pig populations,
controlling it will be very, very difficult."
