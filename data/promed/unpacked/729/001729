Asian tiger mosquitoes [_Aedes albopictus_], known to carry serious diseases including dengue fever and chikungunya, were spotted in Paris for the 2nd year running this summer [2015], a local French health agency said.

The striped insects were detected by a visitor to the Parc Floral botanical garden in the east of the French capital. Tests by the health agency and city authorities confirmed they were Asian tiger mosquitoes.

The park was closed on Wednesday [19 Aug 2015] night for an anti-mosquito operation, the city of Paris said in a statement. Authorities said the presence of the mosquitoes in the park was recent and confined to ponds away from homes and that no other green space in the city had been affected.

The Asian tiger mosquito, which can bite dozens of times a minute and originates from Asia, was spotted for the 1st time in the Paris region last year [2014], 10 years after the 1st specimen was found in France in the southeast of the country.

Diseases transmitted by insects such as mosquitoes are on the rise and have spread across new parts of Europe, including Greece, Italy and France, over the past decade. However, no indigenous case of dengue fever or chikungunya has been found in the Paris region to date, the health agency said.

On Thursday [20 Aug 2015], the prefecture of the Gard region in the south of the country said that 2 indigenous cases of dengue fever contracted through Asian tiger mosquito bites had been reported. "For the moment, it's an outbreak that is isolated geographically [involving] 2 people living in the same house. They were cured and are in good health now," the authority said in a statement.

Six cases of dengue fever have been reported in the neighboring region of Provence since 2010.

[This is the 1st report of the presence of _Aedes albopictus_ in Paris that ProMED-mail has posted. However, the reported autochthonous cases (11 chikungunya and 4 dengue confirmed indigenous cases in 2014) indicate that this mosquito has been present in France recently and transmitting these viruses.

The report does not provide details about the number of individuals of _Aedes albopictus_ detected. As long as the weather remains warm, rapid reproduction can occur if these mosquitoes are not promptly eliminated. Unless the strain of _Ae. albopictus_ there can undergo diapause (suspension of development), they should be eliminated by the 1st killing frosts. As the report above indicates, a plan for surveillance and control is needed.
