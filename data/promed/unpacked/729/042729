A 25-year-old youngster [S], resident of Sarjani Town Karachi, was brought to Jinnah Hospital on suspicion of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, commonly referred to as Congo fever, on Wed 31 Mar 2021, Dunya News reported.

According to the Executive Director of Jinnah Hospital, Dr Simi Jamali, the blood samples of the affected person were sent to the laboratory for testing and found positive for the disease.

This is the 2nd case of Congo virus this year [2021] in Karachi. Sources said that the affected person is associated with dairy farming.

Congo fever is a tick-borne viral disease which is mainly transferred to humans from pets. The symptoms of the viral disease may include fever, muscle pains, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding into the skin. Complications may also include liver failure.

[This is the 2nd case of CCHF reported from Pakistan in 2021; the last case was reported in March 2021.

"The hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats. Many birds are resistant to infection, but ostriches are susceptible and may show a high prevalence of infection in endemic areas. For example, a former outbreak occurred at an ostrich abattoir in South Africa.

"Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks, and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites.

"The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians.

"Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons. Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles, and contamination of medical supplies.

"The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1 to 3 days, with a maximum of 9 days. The incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually 5 to 6 days, with a documented maximum of 13 days.

"There are no vaccines available for use in animals or humans. However, steps can be taken to reduce the risk of infection in people.

"In the absence of a vaccine, the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus.

Reducing the risk of tick-to-human transmission:
- wear protective clothing (long sleeves, long trousers);
- wear light-coloured clothing to allow easy detection of ticks on the clothes;
- use approved acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) on clothing;
- use approved repellent on the skin and clothing;
- regularly examine clothing and skin for ticks;
- seek to eliminate or control tick infestations on animals;
- wear gloves and other protective clothing while handling animals;
- avoid close physical contact with CCHF-infected people;
- wear gloves and protective equipment when taking care of ill people;
- wash hands regularly after caring for or visiting ill people."
