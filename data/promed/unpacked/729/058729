Germany's Ministry of Agriculture was cited as saying on Wednesday that
local veterinary authorities in the northern German state of
Schleswig-Holstein completed the incineration of 3,700 pigs Tuesday
following an outbreak of Aujeszky's [German spelling = Aujeszkysche -
Mod.TG disease. Pigs on three farms in the state were found to be affected
with Aujeszky's disease, a sexually transmitted disease which can cause the
death of piglets and bring about respiratory problems for older pigs.
Bernhard Polten, a veterinary official at the Ministry of Agriculture in
Bonn, was cited as saying the authorities in Schleswig-Holstein were not
obliged to destroy all the pigs in the affected herds. An alternative
response would have been mass vaccination. They destroyed the pig herds for
fear that Schleswig-Holstein may otherwise lose its chance of being
registered as free of the disease by the European Union. A state is
registered as free of Aujeszky's disease if less than 0.1% of its pig herd
is affected by the disease and once the E.U. Standing Veterinary Commission
has given its approval. Polten was cited as saying that over the last two
and a half years, less than 0.1% of the pig herd in Schleswig-Holstein has
been affected by Aujeszky's disease. Locally approved certificates are
needed to transport pigs to and from German states not registered as being
free of Aujeszky's disease.
