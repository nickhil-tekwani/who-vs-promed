Study links virus to chronic fatigue syndrome
---------------------------------------------
A virus recently linked to prostate cancer is a new suspect in
chronic fatigue syndrome. US scientists tested blood from 101
patients and found two-thirds carried it. That does not mean the
virus causes chronic fatigue, stressed the research published
Thursday [8 Oct 2009] in the journal Science [the abstract of this
paper is reproduced below].

The team of scientists from the National Cancer Institute and
Nevada's Whittemore Peterson Institute said it was possible the
virus, named XMRV [xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus]
was just "a passenger virus" that catches a ride in patients whose
immune systems are weakened by chronic fatigue.

Moreover, the researchers found nearly 4 percent of healthy people
carried the virus, too. That raises bigger questions about just what
role this recently discovered virus -- a relative of viruses that
cause cancer in mice -- may be playing in overall health. "This
suggests that several million Americans may be infected with a
retrovirus of as-yet-unknown pathogenic potential," the researchers concluded.

Various viruses have been linked to chronic fatigue over the years,
only to fall by the wayside as potential culprits in the mysterious
illness thought to afflict millions. It is characterized by at least
6 months of severe fatigue, impaired memory, and other symptoms, but
there's no test for it -- doctors rule out other possible causes --
and no specific treatment.

XMRV is related to mouse leukemia viruses. No one knows how it arose
or how people become infected. But another research team recently
found the virus lurking in about a quarter of 200 prostate tumors --
and in about 6 percent of non-cancerous prostate samples they used
for comparison. [See below and: Retrovirus XMRV is found in prostate
cancer cells <http://www.pnas.org/content/104/5/1449.full>]. "There
is still much that we do not understand," including whether people
with either disease just are more prone to infection, cautioned Tufts
University microbiologist John Coffin in an accompanying editorial.
Still, "further study may reveal XMRV as a cause of more than one
well-known 'old' disease."

XMRV was discovered just a few years ago. Researchers reported in
2007 that they had found it in prostate cancer tissue, but no one
knew what that meant because no one knew anything about the virus.

Researchers are now looking for the XMRV in other types of human
tumors, including breast cancer; and they are trying to find out
whether the virus causes the tumors to develop, or is just there incidentally.

Abstract
--------
"Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating disease of unknown
etiology that is estimated to affect 17 million people worldwide.
Studying peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from CFS
patients, we identified DNA from a human gammaretrovirus, xenotropic
murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV), in 68 of 101 patients (67
percent) compared to 8 of 218 (3.7 percent) healthy controls. Cell
culture experiments revealed that patient-derived XMRV is infectious
and that both cell-associated and cell-free transmission of the virus
are possible. Secondary viral infections were established in
uninfected primary lymphocytes and indicator cell lines following
exposure to activated PBMCs, B cells, T cells, or plasma derived from
CFS patients. These findings raise the possibility that XMRV may be a
contributing factor in the pathogenesis of CFS."

The earlier paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
reported that a retrovirus known as "xenotropic murine leukemia
virus-related virus" (XMRV) has been found in tumor tissue from men
with prostate cancer. Of 233 prostate tumors tested, 23 percent had
evidence of the virus, while only 4 percent of samples from 101 men
with benign prostatic enlargement contained the virus. The tumors
that scored the highest on a 10-point scale of severity were more
likely to contain the virus than tumors that were less severe. (Of
the tumors scoring 9 or higher on the 10-point scale, 44 percent had
the virus in the tumor cells.) XMRV was discovered just a few years
ago. Researchers reported in 2007 that they had found it in prostate
cancer tissue, but no one knew what that meant because no one knew
anything about the virus (<http://www.pnas.org/content/104/5/1449.full>).

In neither of these situations is there an exact correlation between
the presence of XMRV and the diseases/conditions concerned. Further
research will be required to establish the precise role of XMRV in
human prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome. - Mod.CP]
