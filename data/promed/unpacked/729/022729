Leishmaniasis - Herat province
------------------------------
In the Islam Qala area, on the border with Iran,
a new outbreak of Leishmaniasis has recently
afflicted the local population. On Sat 30 Oct
2010 tens of women and men lined up at a
specialized clinic supported by the World Health
Organization (WHO), where patients receive free treatment.

The parasitic disease -- caused by sand fly bites
-- leaves disfiguring skin sores which only a
very painful injection of Sodium Stibogluconate,
repeatedly administered, can cure.

In Khosan district of Herat province the number
of infections has increased during the past few
years, with an estimated 10 000 to 15 000 cases
according to the provincial health department.

A female patient, 34, her face disfigured, can't
afford the medication to treat the disease. "I
don't have enough money to go to the private
clinics; I am relieved today that there is a free
clinic here where I can go to for treatment," she explains.

But Dr Mohammed Yonos Nadeem, head of the
Leishmaniasis and Malaria National Control
Programme in Herat, calls for more support: "The
injections and bed nets treated with insecticide
that we have here today cover only 150 patients.
This is not enough and, to better control the
transmission, we need more support not only in
Kohsan district but also in all parts of the province."

In an emergency initiative WHO additionally
distributed 1200 nets treated with insecticide,
to cover doors, windows or beds for 3600 people.
This is part of a larger plan to stop further
transmission of the disease in the district and beyond.

[The above report on the increase in incidence of
leishmaniasis in Herat Province was brought to
the forefront as a country-wide leishmaniasis
effort is being launched with the assistance of
United Nations. A recent WHO, Weekly
Epidemiologic Record (WER) presented a review of
the challenges of leishmaniasis in Afghanistan,
mentioning that in Kabul alone, there were an
estimate of at least 200 000 cases of
leishmaniasis, with an increase in annual case
load from 17 000 to approximately 65 000 in 2009
(see
<http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/resources/documents/en/wer7729.pdf>
and
<http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2010/10/15/13m-afghans-risk-contracting-leishmaniasis-who>).
In the prior ProMED-mail report on leishmaniasis
in Afghanistan there was mention of an outbreak
of leishmaniasis in a small village in western
Herat province's Kohsan district with 63 people
infected since August [2010] (see Leishmaniasis -
Afghanistan (02) 20101016.3753).
