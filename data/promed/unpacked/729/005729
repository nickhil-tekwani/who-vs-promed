Mysterious disease kills 5 in eastern Nepal
-----------------------------------------------
At least 5 people have succumbed to a mysterious disease in eastern Nepal,
a government officer confirmed here Tuesday [23 Aug 2005].
"The unknown disease has claimed the lives of 3 patients in Beltar village
and 2 in Siddipur village, Udyapur district, some 300 km east of
Kathmandu," Jeevan Prasad Oli, chief district officer, told reporters.
The symptoms included high fever, headache as well as bleeding from the
nose and vomiting blood, Oli noted, adding: "Patients infected with the
disease have been taken to a hospital in Dharan city for treatment."
A 3-member medical team has already been sent to the disease-affected area,
Oli said.
The same disease claimed 2 lives in Beltar and Sundarpur villages 2 weeks
ago [2nd week August 2005], he added.

[ProMED-mail would appreciate more information on the above case clusters.
Checking the symptom complex with Gideon (Global Infectious Disease and
Epidemiology Network <http://www.gideononline.net>, the most likely
disease, given the symptoms presented above, would be one of the old world
hantaviruses. Searching the available literature, there is an article in
the Japanese literature (abstract in English)
<http://www.jarmam.gr.jp/jarmam/8-2/e/2.html> which identified an overall
seropositivity rate of 8.7 percent of 322 specimens from patients attending
outpatient clinics at the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital in
Kathmandu. Of note, a higher positivity rate of 12 percent was seen in
those living outside of the Kathmandu valley (5.1 percent), suggesting
hantavirus infection was more prevalent in rural areas. Given the above
information, hantavirus infection should remain in the differential
diagnosis, at least until more information on these cases is available. -
