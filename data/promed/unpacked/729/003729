Garden centres in the Scottish region [Lothian] are offering advice to customers in the wake of investigations into the link between possible contaminated bags of compost and confirmed cases of _Legionella longbeachae_.

NHS Lothian confirmed that it is currently investigating 4 cases of _L. longbeachae_ linked to gardening compost. 2 patients are currently being treated in intensive care in hospital, while 2 other patients have been discharged from hospital. Reports in the local press suggest that a further case of legionellosis reported in Tayside, Scotland, is also being linked to the investigation.

The Growing Media Association (GMA) has issued a statement, saying that it is, "aware of the recent outbreak of _L. longbeachae_ in Scotland, which is reportedly from contaminated bagged growing media," adding that the organisation is in contact with NHS Lothian and has offered its full support with the investigation into the source of the contamination.

The association explains, until the most recent outbreak, there had been only 12 reported cases of legionellosis potentially connected to the _L. longbeachae_ microbe in Great Britain since 1990 -- with only 3 of those cases thought to be related to gardening. However, it still has to take the present situation seriously, adding that, "the growing media industry is committed to acting in a responsible manner."

Merryhatton Garden Centre in East Lothian has followed advice issued by the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) and GMA, passing the information about handling growing media onto its customers.

Manager Lorraine Hunter told DIY Week: "We've followed the advice issued by the official associations and have been told that the risk is very low. Those at most risk are people who are gardening indoors, who are over 55, and who smoke or have underlying health problems. We have made the information available to our customers and pinned the guidelines up in full view by our tills but explain that the general view of the HTA and GMA is that the risk of severe disease is low. People just need to use common sense and follow sensible precautions, like using gloves and washing their hands after gardening, particular before consuming food."

She added that the investigation is not having an impact on compost sales: "Customers are aware of the situation because we have had a few commenting that they have read it in the paper but it's not stopped anyone buying compost or going about their day-to-day business."

The GMA said it had conducted a global analysis of the situation to inform the appropriate policy on handling and labelling advice in April this year [2013]. The conclusion of the analysis, which was assessed by an independent microbiologist, "was that the extremely low incidence rate would make it disproportionate to apply warning labels to bagged growing media", said the association. "Instead, labelling should promote good hygiene practice, including the importance of hand washing after all gardening activities, particularly before eating and drinking. This is standard practice for GMA manufacturers."

Homebase, which operates garden centres in its stores throughout Scotland, has echoed these sentiments. A spokesperson for the company said: "Our growing media suppliers are members of the GMA and are in direct contact with the investigations team in Scotland... We fully support the advice being given by the Horticultural Trades Association and bags of our own-brand growing media carry on pack advice to wear gloves when handling the product and washing hands after gardening activity."

[The news report above says there are 4 cases of legionellosis, presumably legionnaires' disease, the pneumonic form of legionellosis, due _Legionella longbeachae_ in Lothian, Scotland. This is the same number as reported in a prior ProMED-mail post (Legionellosis - UK (05): (Scotland) L. longbeachae, compost susp. 20130915.1945844) on this outbreak, now with the addition of a 5th case of legionellosis due _L. longbeachae_ reported in Tayside, Scotland, that is being linked to the Lothian cases by the investigation.

The news report says that the 4 cases of _L. longbeachae_ legionellosis are linked to gardening compost but fails to say what the linkage is. Perhaps it is only based on histories of the 5 patients having used compost before becoming ill. Optimally, perhaps _L. longbeachae_ has been cultured from gardening compost used by the 5 cases and the genotype of strains isolated from the patients matches the genotype of the strains isolated from the compost; but this needs further clarification.

Legionnaires' disease due to _L. longbeachae_ has been associated with the use of potting soil and _L. longbeachae_ has been found in soil and potting mix in Australia (Ross IS, Mee BJ, Riley TV: _Legionella longbeachae_ in Western Australian potting mix. Med J Aust 1997; 166(7): 387), where _L. longbeachae_ has accounted for 30.4 percent of cases and _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has accounted for only 45.7 percent of cases of community-acquired legionellosis; whereas elsewhere more than 70 percent of cases of legionnaires' disease are due to _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 (Yu VL, et al: Distribution of _Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by culture in patients with sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: An international collaborative survey. J Infect Dis. 2002; 186(1): 127-8. Available at http://www.legionella.org/lp_distribution.pdf). Unlike _L. longbeachae_, _L. pneumophila_ is found in water sources, such as natural aquatic bodies, including rivers, lakes, and thermally polluted waters.

Australian potting soil is reportedly not sterilized during manufacture and contains a complex mixture of bacteria and free-living amoebae; elevated storage temperatures appear to foster the intra-amoebic growth of _L. longbeachae_ in potting soil. L. longbeachae_ has also been isolated from potting mix in Japan (Koide M, Saito A, Okazaki M, et al: Isolation of _Legionella longbeachae_ serogroup 1 from potting soils in Japan. Clin Infect Dis 1999; 29(4): 943-4; available at http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/4/943.long.

The primary transmission mode is believed to be inhalation of dust from contaminated potting mix, compost, or soil. The compost packaging in Australia has a _L. longbeachae_ warning label (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legionella_longbeachae). The New South Wales (Australia) state government recommends that people reduce exposure to potting mix dust by following the manufacturers' warning present on potting mix labels, including:
- Wet down the potting mix to reduce the dust;
- Wear gloves and a P2 mask when using potting mix (P2 mask is equivalent to US N95 facemask, filtering more than 95 percent of aerosolized particles); and
- Wash your hands after handling potting mix or soil, and before eating, drinking, or smoking (http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/Legionnaires_disease.aspx).

Lothian is a region of the Scottish Lowlands, lying between the southern shore of the Firth of Forth and the Lammermuir Hills and includes Edinburgh City (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothian). For a map of Scotland showing the location of Lothian, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothian.

Tayside used to be an administrative region until 1996 in eastern central lowlands of Scotland, north of Lothian, and includes the cities of Perth and Dundee, located on the banks of the River Tay. For a map showing the location of Tayside, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tayside. - Mod.ML
