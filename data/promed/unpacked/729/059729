Possible fix found for problem of low yield in pandemic vaccine production
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A British laboratory may have found a fix for the low yield problem
that has been plaguing companies making swine flu vaccine, a
scientist from the lab revealed Wednesday [5 Aug 2009]. John Wood of
the U.K.'s National Institute for Biological Standards and Control
(NIBSC) said an improved version of the seed strain his lab produced
in May [2009] seems to generate a virus yield that is on a par with
what manufacturers get when they make seasonal flu vaccine. While
Wood cautioned the increased yield has to be confirmed by
manufacturers, any improvement would be welcome news. Manufacturers
have been clamouring for the new seed strain, which the lab started
shipping out Wednesday.

Marie-Christine Beauchemin, a spokesperson for Canada's pandemic
vaccine contractor, GlaxoSmithKline, confirmed it will obtain the new
seed strain. And Sanofi Pasteur, the world's largest producer of flu
vaccine, said it too is eager to give the new seed strain a try.
"That would be a nice improvement," spokesperson Donna Cary said from
Sanofi's U.S. headquarters in Swiftwater, Pennsylvania, when told
NIBSC estimates the new seed strain increases yield 2.5-fold over the
best producing vaccine virus currently available to manufacturers.

The 1st batch of seed strains available to manufacturers produced
disappointingly low virus yields. Manufacturers reported getting
somewhere between one-quarter and one-half of the yield with the
pandemic virus seed strains as compared to seasonal flu vaccine
production. If left unfixed, the yield problem would have
considerably slowed the rate at which vaccine to protect against the
pandemic H1N1 virus will roll off production lines in coming weeks
and months. And as recently as 2 weeks ago, heads of labs that make
seed strains -- including Wood -- were pessimistic they'd be able to
find a way to increase the virus yield. "If it's confirmed, that
would be good news," Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, head of the World Health
Organization's (WHO) vaccine research initiative, said of the better
yield associated with the improved seed strain.

Wood said the NIBSC team grew up quantities in 100 eggs, simulating
on a minor scale what happens with vaccine production. The yield
looked good at that scale, he said, suggesting that is reason to hope
the new seed strain will perform well in the hands of manufacturers.
"We do these kind of small scale production runs every year for
seasonal flu. And usually it's a pretty good indication of what
manufacturers will find. So I'm kind of quietly confident," he said.
Wood, principal scientist in NIBSC's department of virology, said his
lab used an unusual approach in its efforts to produce a better
yielding seed strain. Scientists repeated a step in the production
process many times more than is usual -- that being the growing of
viruses in eggs. Eggs are inoculated with viruses, which grow, are
harvested and then placed into a new batch of eggs for additional
growth. The process, called passaging, is generally done only a
couple of times to allow a seed strain to adapt to growing in eggs.
"Normally we send these viruses out with the minimum of passaging,
because we need to get it out quickly, really," Wood said.

But where NIBSC's original seed strain was passaged twice, the new
one went through 13 rounds of growth in eggs. The lab has never
passaged a seed strain so many times, Wood admitted. "It was really
because of the unusual circumstances that we really didn't have
anywhere else to turn."

Another lab has tried a similar approach and it too may have some
results as a consequence. Doris Bucher, head of the laboratory at the
New York Medical College in Valhalla, New York, confirmed her team
has produced 3 new variants of their original seed strain, all of
which appear to produce higher yields than the original. (The team's
1st seed strain was the best of the original batch made available to
manufacturers.) They were produced [by] 6 additional passages through
eggs, said Bucher. She suggested in an e-mail message that the
additional passaging probably contributed to the better yield of
hemagglutinin, the major surface protein on a flu virus that is used
in vaccine to induce development of virus-specific antibodies.

One potential drawback for manufacturers is the fact that the NIBSC
seed strain was created using reverse genetics, a patented process
that lets scientists create a hybrid virus made of whatever
constellation of genes is desired. In this case, the seed strain has
2 external genes from the target virus and 6 internal genes from a
flu virus that grows well in eggs. Bucher's team produces its seed
strains using what's called the classical method, in which the target
virus and the high-growth virus are allowed to naturally swap genes.
Offspring containing the desired gene constellations are then harvested.

Seed strains produced by the classical method are provided free to
manufacturers. But royalties must be paid for any vaccine doses made
from seed strains created using reverse genetics. The intellectual
property (IP) rights are held by MedImmune Inc. of Gaithersburg,
Maryland, which has said it will waive payment for vaccine that is
donated to the WHO for use in low-income countries. All things being
equal, vaccine makers would likely prefer to use a classically
produced seed strain. But a significantly improved yield "may be
persuasive," Wood said. Sanofi's Cary agreed. "If you're going to get
significantly more doses faster, then certainly that could offset any
IP costs."

Flu tests miss many cases, U.S. CDC confirms
--------------------------------------------
Current quick tests for flu miss many cases of the new pandemic H1N1
strain, researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention [CDC] reported on Thursday [6 Aug 2009]. The accuracy of
the tests ranged from just 40 percent to 69 percent in detecting
swine flu, the CDC team reported.

The findings confirm the CDC's warnings that instant tests performed
on the spot in doctor's offices and clinics are not highly worthwhile
for diagnosing H1N1 infections. The 3 popular tests were better at
detecting seasonal influenza, catching more than 80 percent of H3N2
infections, the CDC found. But in general for patients, the agency
advises treating based on symptoms and the knowledge that the virus
is circulating in a community.

"The recent appearance and worldwide spread of novel influenza
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus has highlighted the need to evaluate
commercially available, widely used, rapid influenza diagnostic
tests," the researchers wrote in the CDC's weekly report on death and
disease. The team at CDC's influenza division tested 3 popular
diagnostics -- BinaxNow, made by Inverness Medical Innovations,
Becton Dickinson's Directigen EZ Flu A+B test and Quidel's QuickVue.
They used 65 respiratory specimens collected during April and May
[2009] that had previously tested positive either for swine flu
[influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus] or one of the seasonal flu
viruses. All had been evaluated using a slower but highly accurate
test called real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction, or rRT-PCR, which checks for the genetic material of the virus.

"The results showed that, although the (rapid tests) were capable of
detecting the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus from respiratory specimens
containing high levels of virus, the overall sensitivity was low,"
the CDC team wrote. The QuickVue test detected 69 percent of the H1N1
cases, the Directigen test found 49 percent and BinaxNow caught just
40 percent. None can distinguish among the different types of flu --
they just tell a patient and a doctor if one of the flu viruses is
there. In its latest update, the World Health Organization last week
reported 162 230 confirmed cases of the pandemic H1N1 virus and 1154
deaths, but the CDC says more than a million people in the United
States alone have been infected. Most public health officials have
given up on trying to get precise counts of how many people are
infected. The CDC's study gives one reason why: even if patients go
to the doctor to be tested, and not all do, the instant test does not
do a good job of detecting swine flu.

Many companies have seen an opportunity to make better quick,
point-of-care flu diagnostics. GlaxoSmithKline and Enigma Diagnostics
have an agreement to develop point-of-care PCR tests to identify
specific flu strains. Seegene, based in South Korea and Maryland,
says it is developing a multiplex PCR test for hospitals that can
quickly detect different influenza types and look for resistance to
antiviral drugs, too. Utah-based DxNA has asked the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration to approve its quick GeneSTAT PCR test.
California-based Osmetech had asked for FDA emergency approval of a
test it says can differentiate among 18 common bacterial and viral
infections, includingH1N1 flu.
