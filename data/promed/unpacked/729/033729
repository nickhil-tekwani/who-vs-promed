African trypanosomiasis after a safari to Tanzania
--------------------------------------------------
A previously healthy woman of Swedish origin has been diagnosed with African trypanosomiasis most probably _Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense_ on 3 Dec 2012 after a tourist visit to north western Tanzania.

She fell ill with fever, malaise, muscular pain, and slight headache 2 days earlier on 1 Dec 2012. The blood parasitemia was quite high (about 70 trypomastigotes/microliter blood) but no trypomastigotes were found in the CSF.

Treatment with suramin was given and the patient has improved. The safari included a game drive and one night at a lodge in Lake Manyara National Park (19-20 Nov 2012), 3 nights and several game drives in Serengeti (20-23 Nov 2012), and finally one night and a game drive in Ngorongoro crater.

The patient could not recall any bites of tsetse flies during her visit to the national parks (NPs). The NPs in north western Tanzania are well known endemic areas for human trypanosomiasis but it is difficult to establish where the patient was infected. During the 1st half year of 2001 a total of 7 cases were reported among visitors to Serengeti, Ngorongoro, and lake Manyara NPs. (Jelinek, et al. 2001).

As a response to this an extensive vector control program was initiated. During the following 10 years only occasional reports have been found in the literature on human trypanosomiasis transmission from this area and one posting on ProMED mail (tourist to Serengeti 2005).

It thus seems as if the incidence has decreased considerably. Hopefully, the present case is not the 1st sign of an increasing risk for sleeping sickness in the north western NPs in Tanzania. These parks are major tourist destinations and it is important to suspect trypanosomiasis in all visitors with non-malarious fevers.

[ProMED-mail thanks Urban Hellgren and colleagues for submitting this report. It is suggested that the risk has declined in Serengeti National Park since 2005 based on fewer reports. However, this can not be concluded for certain if the number of visitors at risk is not known. The latest report of trypanosomiasis in a visitor to East Africa was from Masai Mara in March 2012. - Mod.EP
