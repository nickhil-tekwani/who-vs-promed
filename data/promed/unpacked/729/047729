Current total is 26 bison --- most are of similar vintage (died about 10-14
days ago), but with one that died about 3 days ago.
All have been treated with formaldehyde, and we are currently in carcass
burning mode -- 16 done, and should finish up over the next few days
(unless additional cases are found).
We are collecting data for all of the cases, and will put that all together
once things slow down (very little time in the office while field ops are
ongoing).

carcasses is hard work. - Mod.MHJ]
