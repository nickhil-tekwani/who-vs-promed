[1] Cholera - Uganda: (Kampala)

Cholera has once again struck Kampala. A total of 6 patients have been
admitted at the cholera isolation camp in Mulago Hospital; 4 of the
patients belong to the same family in Kifumbira zone in Kamwokya, a Kampala
suburb. Dr Mohammed Kirumira, the Kampala chief health inspector, said 4
cholera cases had been confirmed.

A man, his pregnant wife, plus their sons aged 10 and 8 were first admitted
at Maria Asumpta Clinic in Kamwokya on Sunday [27 Jan 2008] before being
referred to Mulago. "They first brought the elder boy, who complained of
stomach pains, diarrhea, and vomiting. The next day, the younger one
reported with similar complications," said Irene Migere, a midwife at the
clinic. Subsequently, the boys' parents came with similar symptoms before
they were referred to Mulago. The other 2 unidentified cholera patients
were admitted in the isolation unit.

Reports that suspected cholera cases had also been registered in Kawempe
were not verified by the health authorities. However, the division
chairperson, Nasser Takuba, said 2 suspected cases had been reported at the
border between the central and Kawempe divisions.

[2] Cholera - Congo DR: (Katanga)

Since the beginning of January 2008, MSF has recorded more than 1700 people
with cholera in the cities of Lubumbashi, Bukama, and Likasi. All these
people came from the poorer areas where bad hygiene conditions, combined
with high population density, contribute to the flaring up of this
contagious disease.

"What we have seen in Lubumbashi was repeated in Likasi," said Bertrand
Perrochet, MSF emergency team coordinator. "Adequate measures to avoid the
outbreak have not been taken by the health authorities. In the space of a
few days the main referral hospitals in the district of Kenya in
Lubumbashi, and in the city of Likasi, were overloaded. There were not
enough beds, no continuous disinfection of the building. An alarming
situation for a contagious disease that kills up to 50 per cent of
patients, if left untreated."

MSF logisticians simultaneously improved the treatment center in Lubumbashi
and built a new one in another neighborhood of this 1.3 million people
city. "Thanks to the opening of this 2nd treatment center, the number of
patients has become manageable on both sides" said Perrochet. "These last
days, 25 patients on average have come to be treated in each health center."

In Likasi, a city of more than 300 000 people, a 2nd emergency team has
faced a similar situation: large numbers of patients treated in bad
conditions and a hospital deprived of the necessary infrastructure to treat
people correctly. "In the last 3 weeks, more than 400 patients have
solicited care in the only functioning treatment center in Likasi," added
Perrochet. "When we arrived, more than 60 new patients were coming every
single day in a center which has a normal capacity of 35. There was not
enough space or beds. Water and rehydration solutions were missing as well.
Hygiene conditions were catastrophic."

More than 2000 cholera cases, including 59 deaths, have been recorded in
January 2008 in the Democratic Republic of Congo's south eastern Katanga
province, an aid organization said Wednesday [30 Jan 2008]. Three different
sites in the province have registered 2083 cholera cases, said Bertrand
Perrochet, an official with Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF; Doctors Without
Borders). A week ago, MSF had reported 1463 cases and 30 deaths, mostly in
the provincial capital of Lubumbashi, the mining city of Likasi, and the
rural area of Bukama.

In Bukama, the outbreak appears to have been brought under control and the
organization's emergency teams have been sent to Likasi, with a population
of more than 300 000. "When we arrived in Likasi (last week), more than 60
new patients were arriving each day for a center with a capacity of 35
people," MSF said. "Hygienic conditions were catastrophic."

MSF has recorded 30 deaths and 687 cases in Likasi over the course of a month.

MSF has been operating a primary health care clinic in the Yaqshid area of
Mogadishu since 1994. In Balcad and Kaaran areas, a relatively more stable
security situation has allowed some limited access to 4 MSF outpatient clinics.

In November 2007, MSF teams performed 12 061 consultations, the majority
related to maternal and child health. In the same month, MSF teams saw a
worrying increase of watery diarrhea cases, from 50 to 78. In December, MSF
opened a new 50-bed inpatient pediatric clinic in the Abdul-Aziz district.

A total of 5 people have tested positive for cholera but it cannot be
termed an outbreak as the cases are from different parts of Bangalore,
sources at the Department of Health and Family Welfare said on Wednesday
[29 Jan 2008].

The 5 affected by cholera are from Central Street in Neelasandra, Cox Town,
Dooravaninagar, Economically Weaker Section Quarters in Kormanagala and
Hoskote, sources added. No person has tested positive for cholera at
Bharathinagar, where the 1st case of gastroenteritis was reported.

The 19 samples sent to the Public Health Institute (PHI) on Tuesday [29 Jan
2008] from the Epidemic Diseases Hospital and the Bruhat Bangalore
Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) hospital in Bharathinagar have tested negative. At
the BBMP hospital in Bharathinagar, 206 people were treated as outpatients
on Wednesday [30 Jan 2008] and the number of people in the area complaining
of diarrhea and vomiting has come down, sources said. R Murali Krishna,
doctor at GM Hospital in Bharathinagar, said only 5 persons were treated
for symptoms of gastroenteritis and only one admitted.

Shivaram, joint director (Communicable Diseases) at the Department of
Health and Family Welfare, said that Bangalore Urban District (which
includes Bangalore city) reported only 28 cases of cholera in the last 2 years.

[8] Cholera - Laos: (Xekong)
Date: Wed 30 Jan 2008

The 1st outbreak of cholera in southern Lao People's Democratic Republic in
nearly 8 years has prompted a vigorous response from UNICEF and its
partners. UNICEF's response is in close coordination with the Lao Ministry
of Health, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Asian Development Bank.

The epidemic was first recognized in the remote Xekong Province in late
December 2007. By mid-January 2008, it had spread to some 30 villages in
the Thataeng and Lamam Districts, where 362 cases of severe diarrhea were
reported, including 3 deaths.

"Now we are ensuring that people have access to safe drinking water,
latrines and boiled water, not just in the 2 affected districts of Xekong
Province but in all surrounding areas," said UNICEF's chief of Water,
Sanitation and Hygiene for Lao PDR, Abdulai Kaikai.

Mr Kaikai, who represented UNICEF on the initial joint assessment mission
to the area, commended the swift reaction of the government in dealing with
the crisis. On 11 Jan 2008, Lao PDR prime minister Bouasone Bouphavanh
visited Sekong to coordinate efforts to deal with the outbreak and meet
cholera patients.

Health experts are now hopeful that the outbreak has been contained. No
deaths have been reported since 3 Jan 2008. "The number of new cases has
dramatically dropped," said UNICEF's chief of Young Child Survival and
Development for Lao PDR, Dr Aboudou Karimou Andele. "This means people have
understood what to do to avoid infection."
