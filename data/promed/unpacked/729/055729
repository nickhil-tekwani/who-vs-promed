The Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] says 2 more broiler chicken farms have been put under quarantine due to suspicion of the avian flu.

The CFIA says the 2 new 'suspect' farms are located between the 2 originally infected farms in east Abbotsford and west Chilliwack.

Currently the CFIA is continuing their epidemiological tests on the farm to determine if the birds will need to be destroyed. The agency is encouraging other poultry farmers to report any signs.

The agency is not aware of any farm workers coming down with avian flu symptoms but says they will be offering a vaccine to all poultry workers; which is a practice that has been already in place for years.

In response to the avian flu outbreak at 2 poultry farms, Hong Kong has banned the import of poultry meat and products, including eggs, from the Fraser Valley. More than 7000 tonnes of frozen poultry meat and 170 000 eggs were imported from Canada between January and October [2014].

Previous story
--------------
A turkey farm in Abbotsford and a broiler breeder farm in Chilliwack have been placed under quarantine after the presence of H5 avian influenza was confirmed through preliminary testing.

Initial tests were conducted on [Mon 1 Dec 2014] at a laboratory in Abbotsford after both farms experienced sudden deaths of birds over the weekend. Further testing is currently underway to determine the precise subtype and strain of the virus, and results are expected within days.

The turkey farm started to have an increase in dead birds near the end of last week and by [Sun 30 Nov 2014] had lost 60 per cent of their flock, says Dr Jane Pritchard, chief veterinary officer with the BC Ministry of Agriculture.

"There was nothing that you could look at these birds post-mortem that looked abnormal... we were actually thinking something was in the feed but because the losses were catastrophic, we screen the birds for avian influenza," Pritchard says. "We were expecting those to be negative and they came up positive. It was the high losses that allowed us to catch this."

According to Pritchard, 18 000 birds will be humanely euthanized and composted at the barns. The Abbotsford farm had 11 000 birds but half had died of the disease and the Chilliwack farm had 1000 of their 7000 birds perish.

The names of the 2 affected businesses have not been disclosed but Canadian Food Inspection Agency officials did say the 2 farms had no direct connection and are approximately 8 km [5 mi] away from each other.

Pritchard says the turkeys would have been targetted for the upcoming Christmas market.

The agency says there will be an investigation into how the virus spread between barns -- whether it was due to migratory patterns or personnel moving between the 2 affected areas.

The CFIA says the quarantine measure was taken to control disease spread and the industry sector has been notified to adopt enhanced bio-security practices.

The agency reassures avian influenza viruses do not pose risks to food safety when poultry and poultry products are properly handled and cooked.

The World Health Organization says humans can become ill when infected with viruses from animal sources, including avian influenza virus subtypes H5N1 and H9N2.

The primary risk factor for human infection appears to be direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead animals or contaminated environments.

In January of this year [2014], the 1st case of H5N1 bird flu in North America left an Alberta resident dead. The patient travelled to China in December 2013 and was admitted to hospital in Alberta on New Year's Day. By [3 Jan 2014], the patient died. It was the 1st case of H5N1 Canada has ever seen since the deadly influenza first surfaced over a decade ago.

Avian influenza (AI) is caused by type A influenza virus. The signs can vary from a mild disease with little or no mortality to a highly fatal, rapidly spreading epidemic (highly pathogenic avian influenza) depending on the infecting virus strain, host factors, and environmental stressors. Signs of avian influenza are extremely variable. In some flocks the only evidence of the infection is seroconversion, that is, the birds develop a detectable antibody titer to AI. AI can also be manifest as respiratory, enteric, reproductive, or nervous system disease. Decreased food consumption and drops in egg production are among some of the earliest and most predictable signs of disease.

Signs including coughing, sneezing, ruffled feathers, swollen heads, nervous signs like depression, and diarrhea may occur together or singly. In some cases, birds die rapidly without clinical signs of disease.

Wild birds and their excreta should be considered a major source of avian influenza. Preventing direct contact with free-flying birds and protecting domestic poultry from contact with the feces of wild birds is an important way to prevent avian influenza.

Influenza viruses are very sensitive to most detergents and disinfectants. They are readily inactivated by heating and drying. However, flu viruses are well protected from inactivation by organic material and infectious virus can be recovered from manure for up to 105 days. Complete removal of all organic material is part of any effective disinfection procedure.

Contaminated houses are heated for several days to inactivate virus. Organic material is removed followed by complete cleaning and disinfection of all surfaces. Contaminated litter and manure is problematic and should be composted or buried to ensure that it does not spread infectious virus.

Neither of these articles tells us how the birds became infected. That investigation is still proceeding and hopefully to answer some question. Some questions to be answered would include: Was it from the workers? Was it from poor bio-sanitation? It should be getting cold in Canada, meaning these turkeys are not likely to have access to wild birds, which are likely to have migrated south already.

We anxiously await the rest of the typing as well as understanding how this situation occurred. The number of birds and the distance between the 2 premises raises suspicion of highly pathogenic avian influenza. But the investigation is ongoing and we hope it reveals some other common factor, and that this is not the highly pathogenic strain.

The doors of international trade slamming shut is a predictable response to avian influenza.

[The H5 AI subtype has been previously identified in Canada; however, those cases were associated with a low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) H5N2 strain:
- In 2009, 2 outbreaks of LPAI H5N2 were reported. The premises where the disease was diagnosed was in the Fraser Valley in the province of British Columbia [Note: the same area where the current outbreak is located]. The event was resolved in March 2009 http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=7720.
- An outbreak of LPAI H5N2 was also reported in November 2010 and resolved in February 2011; see event summary at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=9973.

For HPAI events in Canada, until now, only the H7 subtype (H7N3) had been identified:
- In February 2004 several HPAI (H7N3) outbreaks occurred in commercial poultry in a described area in the province of British Columbia. 53 outbreaks were reported and 13.7 million birds were destroyed. See information at http://web.oie.int/hs2/sit_pays_mald_pl.asp?c_pays=32&c_mald=16#.
- Canada last reported HPAI H7N3 in September 2007. The event was resolved on January 2008. The event summary with an updated map is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=6260.

This is the 1st time that an H5 highly pathogenic subtype is reported in Canada.

Avian influenza viruses are divided by subtypes based on 2 proteins found in the viruses: a hemagglutinin, or "H" protein, and a neuraminidase, or "N" protein. There are 16 H types and 9 N types yielding a total 144 possible combinations.

The H5 and H7 subtypes are of particular concern, given the ability of these 2 H-types to mutate from low pathogenic to highly pathogenic strains. These 2 H-types have been known to cause serious disease and mortality in domestic poultry. The H5 and H7 AI viruses are quite common in wild waterfowl (http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/ai/fact-sheet/eng/1356193731667/1356193918453).

The information on the neuraminidase type, when it becomes available, will be of much interest, particularly given the recent spread of the highly pathogenic H5N8 subtype in Asian and Europe. - Mod.CRD
