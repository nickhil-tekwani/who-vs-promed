A 45-year-old man in northwest China's Gansu province has died of plague, the 2nd death of its kind in 2014, official media reported on Sat 4 Oct 2014. The case was reported in Subei County under the jurisdiction of Jiuquan City. The man, a herder, died on Wednesday, 1 Oct 2014, in hospital.

The provincial health and family planning commission confirmed the case after lab reports were released, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The man grazed his sheep in a pasture where widespread plague has been reported among marmots in recent years.

A total of 41 people who had close contact with the man have been put in quarantine under medical observation. None have shown any symptoms so far. His home village has also been isolated and thoroughly disinfected. It is the 2nd plague death in Jiuquan in 2014. The other fatality was also marmot-related.

The National Health and Family Planning Commission has sent specialists to the county to prevent the plague from spreading. Plague is categorized as a Class A infectious disease, the most serious under China's Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases.

[No specific information is available. Most deaths from _Yersinia pestis_ human infection relates to bacteremic complications or the primary or secondary development of pneumonic plague. It is that form of infection that can result in person-to-person transmission. Given the isolation precautions, it might be assumed that the gentleman had developed pneumonic plague.

Primary pneumonic plague (one percent of natural plague presentations) arises as a result of inhalation of plague bacilli in infectious aerosols, such as would be produced when there are secondary pneumonic complications in bubonic/septicemic plague.

Primary plague pneumonia has a short incubation period of 1-3 days, after which there is sudden onset of flu-like symptoms including fever, chills, headache, generalized body pains, weakness, and chest discomfort. A cough develops with sputum production, which may be bloody, and increasing chest pain and difficulty in breathing. As the disease progresses, hypoxia (low oxygen concentration in the blood) and hemoptysis (coughing up blood) are prominent. The disease is invariably fatal unless antimicrobial therapy commences within 24 hours of exposure.

Patients with primary pneumonic plague generate large quantities of infectious aerosols that pose a significant risk to close contacts. CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines identify contacts within 2 meters (6.5 ft) as being at greatest risk and do not consider the organism likely to be carried through air ducts or vents. Persons who have been in contact with pneumonic plague patients or handling potentially infectious body fluids or tissues without appropriate protection should receive preventive antimicrobial therapy. The preferred antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis are tetracyclines, quinolones, or chloramphenicol.

The marmot is the most common reservoir for _Yersinia pestis_ in eastern Asia. The etymology of the term "marmot" is uncertain (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot). It may have arisen from the Gallo-Romance prefix marm-, meaning to mumble or murmur (an example of onomatopoeia). Another possible origin is post-classical Latin, mus montanus, meaning "mountain mouse". - Mod.LL
