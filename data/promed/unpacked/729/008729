[While we do not have the dates of onset of the newly confirmed cases, it is apparent the outbreak in Riyadh is continuing. From the media report in the 5 Sep 2015 update mentioning 9 healthcare workers in another hospital with MERS-CoV infection, and other media reports mentioning that there were no newly confirmed cases in the King Abdulaziz Medical Center, it is quite likely that these newly reported cases are in the 2nd hospital. Of note is that 4 of the 7 newly reported cases are in healthcare workers. Enough said...

With the addition of these newly confirmed cases, there have now been 152 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported in Riyadh since 21 Jul 2015.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Jordan
----------------------------------------------------------------
Between [30 and 31 Aug 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of Jordan notified WHO of 2 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 1 death. Both cases are associated with a MERS-CoV outbreak currently occurring in a hospital in Amman city.

Details of the cases
1- A 73-year-old female from Amman city was admitted to hospital due to her chronic conditions on [21 Aug 2015] and, on [24 Aug 2015], was discharged. This hospital has been experiencing a MERS-CoV outbreak. On [28 Aug 2015], the patient developed symptoms and, on the same day, was admitted to the same hospital. She was treated symptomatically and discharged from hospital on [29 Aug 2015]. As her symptoms worsened, the patient visited a different hospital and was admitted on the same day. She tested positive for MERS-CoV on [31 Aug 2015]. Currently, the patient is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. Investigation of possible epidemiological links with the MERS-CoV cases admitted to her hospital or with shared health care workers is ongoing. The patient has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.

2- A 56-year-old male from Amman city was admitted to hospital for a medical procedure on [18 Aug 2015]. This hospital has been experiencing a MERS-CoV outbreak. While hospitalized, on [28 Aug 2015], the patient developed symptoms and, on [30 Aug 2015], tested positive for MERS-CoV. The patient, who had comorbidities, passed away on [1 Sep 2015]. Investigation of possible epidemiological links with the MERS-CoV cases admitted to her hospital or with shared health care workers is ongoing. The patient had no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.

Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.

Globally, the WHO has been notified of 1495 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 528 related deaths.
