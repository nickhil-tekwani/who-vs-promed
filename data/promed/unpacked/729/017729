The World Health Organization (WHO) has received reports of a suspected
pneumonic plague outbreak in 2 health zones in Haut-Uele district, the
majority reported from Wamba health zone in Oriental province in the
northern part of the country. From 31 Jul to 8 Oct 2006, 626 suspected
cases including 42 deaths have been reported. However, the low case
fatality ratio is unusual for pneumonic plague which suggests that the
number of suspected cases may be an overestimation.
Preliminary results from a rapid diagnosis test in the field found 3
samples positive, out of 8. Additional laboratory confirmation is under way.
A team from the Provincial Health Authority, WHO and Medecins sans
Frontieres (MSF Switzerland) carried out an initial investigation. Disease
surveillance is being strengthened and case management, contact tracing,
and sensitization of the affected population are being implemented.
