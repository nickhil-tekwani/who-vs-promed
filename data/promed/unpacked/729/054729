2nd feline case of tularemia diagnosed at VDL
---------------------------------------------
Since April 2016 the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (VDL) has confirmed 3 cases of tularemia in Minnesota.

Tularemia is a naturally occurring disease of wildlife, particularly rabbits, squirrels, and other rodents. It is a disease that both people and animals can get through tick and fly bites or contact with infected animals.

Tularemia is rare in Minnesota, between 0 and 3 cases are identified in people and 0 to 5 cases are identified in animals annually. To date this year [2016], the 3 cases have been identified in a cottontail rabbit and 2 cats -- all in the Twin Cities [Minneapolis-Saint Paul] metropolitan area.

Cats are the most commonly affected domestic animal in Minnesota; outdoor cats that hunt rabbits are at highest risk. Infected cats often have a high fever, mouth ulcers, depression, and loss of appetite. Dogs rarely show signs, but can have a skin abscess at the site of infection, loss of appetite, and fever.

Signs and symptoms of tularemia in people usually involve fever, swollen lymph nodes, and skin or mouth ulcers. Tularemia is treatable with antibiotics. Symptoms may also include skin or mouth ulcers, diarrhea, muscle aches, joint pain, cough, and weakness. It cannot be transferred person to person. People who have had contact with animals such as wild rabbits and have symptoms consistent with tularemia, should consult their healthcare provider and notify the Minnesota Department of Health.

According to Jeff Bender, DVM, MS and professor at the College of Veterinary Medicine, tularemia can be prevented by avoiding contact with wild animals, wearing gloves when picking up dead animals, and using insect repellent to reduce the chance of tick and fly bites. Cat owners are encouraged to keep their cats indoors. Outdoor cats, as in the recent cases are often hunters, and are at increased risk for tularemia.

Pet owners' who have concerns that their pet has been exposed, should contact their veterinarian.

[Tularemia is a bacterial septicemia that affects more than 250 species of wild and domestic mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and people. It is listed as a category A bioterrorism agent because of the potential for fatality, airborne dissemination, and societal disruption if released.

Etiology
--------
The causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_, is a nonspore-forming, Gram-negative coccobacillus antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It can be cultured readily on blood supplemented with cysteine but must be differentiated from other Gram-negative bacteria on blood agar. The taxonomic status of _Francisella_ has been revised and debated, but recent consensus establishes the subspecies _F. tularensis tularensis_, associated with type A tularemia, _F. tularensis holarctica_, which causes type B tularemia, and a 3rd type, C, associated with _F. novicida_, which has low virulence and is less common than the other 2. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be as high as 30 per cent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and occurs in both the Old and New Worlds.

Epidemiology and transmission
-----------------------------
Among domestic animals, sheep are the commonest host, but clinical infection has also been reported in cats, dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk because of predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, whereas cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domesticated animals. Important wild animal hosts for _F. tularensis tularensis_ include cottontail and jackrabbits, whereas the most common vectors are the ticks _Dermacentor andersoni_ (the wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (the lone star tick), _D. variabilis_ (the American dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (the deer fly). Animal hosts of _F. tularensis holarctica_ are lagomorphs, beaver, muskrat, voles, and sheep. Ticks, flies, fleas, and exposure to contaminated water sources are all associated with transmission of this subspecies, which has also been found to persist naturally in a water-associated amoeba.

Natural foci of infection exist in North America and Eurasia. Although found in every state except Hawaii, tularemia is most often reported in the south central and western USA (for example, California, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Montana).

Tularemia can be transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially [pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ("stadium") to the next] and transovarially [transmission of a pathogen from an organism (as a tick) to its offspring by infection of eggs in its ovary], making them efficient reservoirs and vectors.

The commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but people who prepare or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. Case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people.

Clinical findings
-----------------
The incubation period is 1-10 days. The most severely and commonly affected livestock species are sheep. Type A tularemia is particularly pathogenic for lagomorphs, and cats and nonhuman primates have been reported to be infected. The clinical presentation depends on host species, subspecies of the bacteria, and route of infection. Sheep and cats may be subclinically infected or develop bacteremia, fever, and respiratory infection. Cats may also develop ulceroglandular or oropharyngeal disease, presumably through exposure to infected prey items. Clinical signs include increased pulse and respiratory rates, coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria with lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 per cent mortality.

The most consistent lesions are miliary, white to off-white foci of necrosis in the liver and sometimes in the spleen, lung, and lymph nodes. Organisms can be readily isolated from necropsy specimens by use of special media. The infective dose required to transmit this pathogen is extremely low; thus, risk of infection during necropsy or to laboratory personnel is significant, and special procedures and facilities are essential.

Diagnosis
---------
Tularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague and pseudotuberculosis) or acute pneumonia. When large numbers of sheep show typical signs during periods of heavy tick infestation, tularemia or tick paralysis should be suspected. Tularemia should be considered in cats with signs of acute lymphadenopathy, malaise, oral ulcers, and history of recent ingestion of wild prey.

Diagnosis of acute infection is confirmed by culture and identification of the bacterium, direct or indirect fluorescent antibody test, or a 4-fold increase in antibody titer between acute and convalescent serum specimens. A single titer of greater than or equal to 1:80 by the tube agglutination test is presumptive evidence of prior infection. When tularemia is suspected, laboratory personnel should be alerted as a precaution to reduce the risk of laboratory-acquired infection. In some jurisdictions, tularemia in animals is reportable to public health authorities.

Treatment and control
---------------------
Streptomycin, gentamicin, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels. Gentamicin should be continued for 10 days. Because tetracycline and chloramphenicol are bacteriostatic, they should be continued for 14 days to minimize the risk of relapse. Early treatment is important to minimize risk of fatality. Because of the substantial sylvatic (wildlife and tick) component of the _Francisella_ life cycle, control is limited to reducing arthropod infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment.

Can I get tularemia?
--------------------
Yes. Humans can get tularemia by direct contact with infected animals, inhaling (aerosol) the bacteria in contaminated environments, eating (oral) contaminated food or water or from the bite of an infected insect (vector). Signs usually appear 3 to 5 days after exposure. Disease varies depending route of exposure to the bacteria. Initially flu-like signs, such as fever, chills, nausea, headache, and joint pain occur. Glands (or lymph nodes) may become swollen and painful and may break open and drain pus.

Other signs include skin rash, sore throat, or swelling of the eyes. If the lungs become infected, coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath, and severe pneumonia can occur

How can I protect my animal from tularemia?
-------------------------------------------
Tularemia is difficult to prevent since it can be in the environment or be spread by insects. Prevention measures include keeping pets indoors and away from wildlife. Do not feed animals raw meat, especially that from wild animals. Control ticks and biting flies.

How can I protect myself from tularemia?
----------------------------------------
Avoid contact with wildlife, especially sick animals. Do not handle dead wildlife without gloves. Wash your hands after touching any animal and especially before you eat. When outside, wear insect repellents that contain DEET. Cook all meats and foods thoroughly. Wash fruits and vegetables before eating them. Only drink water from a safe source.

In short: Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ("stadium") to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).

Tularemia does not spread from person to person essentially in contradiction to another category A bioterrorism agent, _Yersinia pestis_, in which the pneumonic form can easily be transmitted (borrowed from my colleague, Mod.LL).
