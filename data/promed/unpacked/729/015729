New Plymouth [Taranaki Region, North Island] residents are being warned about a potential measles outbreak after visitors to the region may have exposed others to the infectious disease.

Taranaki District Health Board's medical officer of health Dr Greg Simmons said 2 people who had recently visited New Plymouth have been confirmed with having measles.

"Both visited New Plymouth during the infectious period of their illness, without knowing they had the disease and unfortunately may have now exposed others to measles," he said.

As of last week there are 60 confirmed cases of measles in New Zealand with most linked to Hamilton.

The 1st case, a Hamilton person, contracted the disease in April [2016] while on an overseas trip and then infected 2 others. Since April, there have been cases in Nelson [South Island], Horowhenua, and Northland [North Island].

Measles is a highly infectious and potentially life threatening disease that spreads quickly.

People who have shared the same air as someone that is infectious with measles may be at risk of developing the disease if they are not already immune.

"Symptoms of measles can include fever, runny nose, and sore, watery, red eyes that can last for several days before a red blotchy rash appears," Simmons said.

"People are infectious from 5 days before the rash appears to 5 days after. Complications are common with measles and about one in 10 people will need hospital treatment.

"Anyone with symptoms of measles should call ahead before visiting their family doctor, after-hours clinic or emergency department, so that steps can be taken to reduce the risk of infecting others in the waiting room."

Measles is a vaccine-preventable disease and anyone who has had at least 2 doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination is considered immune.

People most at risk of contracting the disease are those who have either not had the vaccine, or who have just had one dose of the vaccine.

"Now is the time to consider if you are immune to measles or not. I urge people to ensure they are fully immunised as this is the best way for people to protect themselves and others against measles and it is free to those who need it," Simmons said.

General information on measles is available from the Ministry of Health website at http://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/conditions-and-treatments/diseases-and-illnesses/measles.
