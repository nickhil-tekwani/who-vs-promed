Thailand Confirms More Bird Flu Cases in Chicken
--------------------------------------------
Bird flu spread further in Thailand on Friday [1 Oct 2004], with the
government confirming 4 new outbreaks of the deadly disease, including one
near the border with Malaysia.
The H5N1 bird flu virus was found in chicken and ducks in the northeastern
provinces of Roi Et and Chaiyaphum, the northern province of Uttaradit and
in Yala province bordering northern Malaysia, according to the Thai
Livestock Department's Web site
<http://www.dld.go.th>
Possible fresh outbreaks of the bird flu virus have also been reported in
several other areas, Livestock Department chief Yukol Limlaemthong told
Reuters.
"We have received reports of possible fresh outbreaks in several more areas
in the past 2 days," Yukol said. The suspected areas are in the provinces
of Nonthaburi and Pathum Thani, both near Bangkok, and the northern-central
province of Chainat, Yukol said.
"Chickens in the areas have died unusually. There is a possibility that it
could have been caused by the bird flu virus and we are investigating,"
Yukol said. So far, 92 areas in 28 provinces are under bird flu watch, of
which 50 areas were confirmed to have been hit by the bird flu virus, Yukol
said.
Hundreds of thousands of volunteers and teams from the Health and
Agriculture ministries are being mobilized across the nation in a new drive
to fight bird flu after Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra gave officials a
month to wipe out the disease.
"They can cull right away any chicken that shows symptoms similar to the
bird flu symptoms," Yukol said.

Avian influenza spreads to 4 more provinces
--------------------------------------------
The Thai authorities announced Friday [1 Oct 2004] that avian influenza had
spread to poultry in 4 more provinces.
The additional provinces mean that the disease has now infected flocks of
chickens and other birds in 35 of Thailand's 76 provinces since it
re-emerged in July.
The government has stepped up efforts to bring the disease under control
following confirmation on Tuesday that a 26-year-old woman had probably
contracted the disease from her dying 11-year-old daughter. It was the
first such human-to-human transmission of A(H5N1) avian influenza
documented in Thailand.

follow-up report No 26, dated 1 Oct 2004:

The undertaking to "wipe out the disease in a month" is rather pretentious.
It seems a long way before avian influenza is completely eradicated in
Thailand or in other neighbouring countries; resorting to vaccination,
currently under study, should not surprise observers.- Mod.AS]
