[Although not specified, the hantavirus most likely involved in this
case is Andes virus. Infections can occur when individuals come in
contact with surroundings contaminated with excrement and urine from
Andes virus infected rodents. In rare cases, there can be human to
human transmission of Andes virus when an infected person is in very
close contact with a susceptible individual. This seems unlikely in
the above case, since there is no mention of another human case with
whom the patient was in contact.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can
