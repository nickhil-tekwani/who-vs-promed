In Dagestan, 6 people were hospitalized with suspected anthrax
--------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 6 residents of fat Karat Ahvahskogo district with symptoms of anthrax enlisted the help of their doctors and were hospitalized. According to preliminary data, the cause of infection was the meat bought in the market.

According to a spokesperson of the Office of Rosselkhoznadzor for Dagestan, "On 15 Jun 2012 contaminated meat was sold in Karat village market. To date, 6 people sought medical treatment. Among them is a pregnant woman who is in critical condition and has been transferred to a hospital in Makhachkala."

According to the Rosselkhoznadzor agency in conjunction with the prosecutor's office the cause of their disease was the butchered sick animal.

This is not the 1st case of anthrax among residents of Dagestan. The Caucasian Knot published that in August 2010, 2 residents of the Dagestani village of Hatsinob were admitted to a local hospital with anthrax. In the previous June [2009] there were 6 cases of anthrax infection among the inhabitants in the village of Gimry Untsukulsky. In those cases, 3 children under the age of 14 years were affected and hospitalized in the infectious ward of the district hospital.

That epizootic and epidemiological investigation revealed that the source of infection was butchered sick cattle.

Editor's note: The Prosecutor's Office of Kalmykia has noted that their vaccination of animals against anthrax has not been done in a timely manner. In the Astrakhan region they are trying to prevent the spread of anthrax. While the Volgograd Region is [presently] not threatened by anthrax.

[Reports of anthrax in Dagestan are spotty at best. OIE reported a single bovine case and 3 ovine/caprine outbreaks in 2005, one ovine/caprine case in 2006, and 2 outbreaks in 2010 (one involving a cow and the other a sheep), which is typical of reports culled from diagnostic laboratory log books, which reflect submissions but not the actual events. It did not report the 2011 events commented upon by the Caucasian Know. The 2010 sheep outbreak resulted in 2 people being infected. I think we can assume that livestock anthrax is commoner in the Republic of Dagestan than the records demonstrate.

Dagestan is on the west bank of the Caspian Sea; see:
