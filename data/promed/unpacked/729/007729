[On 29 Dec 2010, ProMED-mail published information from a reliable
source on suspected FMD cases in cattle in Iraq (archive no 20101229.4585). This was followed, several weeks later, by a
submission from a senior veterinary adviser to the Kurdistan Regional
Government (KRG), Erbil-Iraq, encouraging Iraq and other countries of
the region to submit samples and to "have a good reporting and
recording system, be fully transparent, and use all facilities
available to us (archive no. 20110123.0282)." In a commentary,
ProMED-mail joined the expectation for "samples from Iraq, either
already available or to be derived soon from adequate animals, to be
submitted to the WRLFMD for identification, serotyping and genotyping.
This is particularly important to exclude exotic strains."

On 23 Apr 2011, the submission of 17 samples from Iraq to the WRLFMD
was published with anticipation to their serotyping and genotyping
results (archive no. 20110423.1272). As it appears, the submitted
samples had been collected in September 2010; the results, indicative
of the presence of 2 serotypes, O and A, are presented, in summarised
form, in the 2 items above.

According to WRLFMD data, the FMDV-O strain 'PanAsia-2 (ANT-10)'
identified in 6 of the Iraqi samples, is similar to the strain
spreading in the region, including Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan,
Turkey, and Israel. This strain was also the causative agent of the
recent Bulgarian outbreak, reportedly introduced from Turkey by wild
boar(s).

The other strain identified is of serotype A, closely related to
Pakistani, Iranian, and Turkish strains.

It will be useful to sample 2011 cases in Iraq and submit them
similarly to the WRLFMD; in particular, the potential introduction of
FMDV Asia 1, recently identified in Iran and Bahrain, deserves
attention in Iraq and beyond. - Mod.AS]
