Rabbit hemorrhagic disease, Canada
----------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 8 Mar 2018 from Dr Jaspinder Komal, Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Ottawa, Canada

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 14 Feb 2018
Date of confirmation of the event: 7 Mar 2018
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 24 Nov 2016
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus
Serotype: RHDV2
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic and advanced), necropsy
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1 (BC-2018-001): Nanaimo, British Columbia
Date of start of the outbreak: 14 Feb 2018
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
European rabbit: _Oryctolagus cuniculus_ (Leporidae) / - / 30 / 30 / 0 / 0
Affected population: large population of feral rabbits on the Vancouver Island University Campus (Nanaimo, British Columbia) grounds.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Epidemiological comment: approximately 30 feral rabbits have died over the last 2 weeks on the grounds of the Vancouver Island University Campus in Nanaimo, British Columbia. Poisoning was first suspected and samples were submitted to the Animal Health Centre laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture of British-Columbia. The laboratory reported positive results for rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). Samples were submitted to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease for final confirmation and characterization of the virus. Sanger sequencing of the amplicon from the OIE-prescribed RHDV-specific conventional RT-PCR confirms presence of RHDV genomic material in the samples. Whole genome next generation sequencing of nucleic acid extracted from pooled liver provided a near complete 7.4 kb RHDV genome closely matching (93 percent identity) the RHDV-2 isolate RHDV-N11 (KM878681.1) from an outbreak in a rabbit farm in Navarra, Spain in 2011. This is the first occurrence of RHD in wild (feral) rabbits in Canada and the first outbreak of that disease in the province of British-Columbia. During the same period and in the same area, approximately 180 rabbits out of a population of 200 have died in a sanctuary of rabbits (mostly outdoor). RHD is highly suspected.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures
