Laboratory analysis did not confirm the diagnosis of anthrax in the 14-year-old resident of Kadamjai district (Batken region), the press service of the Ministry of Health reported today [12 Sep 2014].

The case of suspected anthrax was registered in the rural municipality of Markaz. The girl found a sore on her hand on [30 Aug 2014], and tried to cure it by herself. On [9 Sep 2014], she went to the hospital, where she was immediately hospitalized in the infectious disease ward. The medical personal sent analyzes to the laboratory of Osh City.

There are no other patients with suspected anthrax.

Nevertheless, anti-epidemic and anti-epizootic measures are being continued in the area.

[Well, this explains the absence of any contributory data to explain how this suspect infection might have been acquired if it had involved either access to an infected carcass or meat. For those members likely to find themselves in a similar clinical situation, a typical anthrax cutaneous lesion is inflamed but it is painless. It itches. And don't scratch it, because that is how one gets secondary skin lesions. - Mod.MHJ
