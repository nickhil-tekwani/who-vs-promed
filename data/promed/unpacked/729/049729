Until 31 Dec, 1998, Switzerland registered 282 BSE [Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy cases that were detected through the mandatory reporting of
clinical suspects. Reporting of clinical cases only accounts for part of
the BSE cases in the population, and it is possible that BSE-incubating or
diseased animals remain undetected and are (a) routinely slaughtered or (b)
culled because of other diseases. The Swiss company Prionics AG, Zuerich,
recently developed a Western Blot system (WB) for fast detection of
PrP(Sc)[infectious prion protein in homogenized brain samples. The WB
showed high agreement with the immunhistochemistry (IHC) in that it
reliably detects BSE-infected cattle in late stages of the incubation
period. The WB has the following advantages: it can be performed in 6-8
hours and on a larger number of samples, it does not depend on the tissue
quality and is, suitable for use with autolytic material. This test system
has been evaluated in a BSE surveillance scheme in 1998.
In a 1997 culling program, herdmates of confirmed Swiss BSE cases were
identified, slaughtered and destroyed. Brain samples were tested by
histology, IHC and, in 1998, with the new WB. Of 1719 cattle tested, 5 were
found to be positive for PrP(Sc) without having displayed clinical signs of
disease.
In summer and fall of 1998, 3022 cattle, 90% older than 2 years of age,
were sampled at slaughter and tested for PrP [non-infectious prion protein
accumulation in the brain. One 4-year old animal was identified in the WB
and confirmed by IHC as PrP(Sc) positive.
All animal carcasses, and all specified bovine offals (brain and eyes in
the scull, spinal cord and tonsils of cattle), are collected and processed
at one Swiss rendering plant, and the resulting meat-and-bone meal
incinerated. Since October of 1998, almost 1000 adult cattle carcasses that
had been delivered to this plant as fallen stock (downer cows, culled
animals) were sampled and tested for the presence of PrP(Sc) in the brain
tissue. Within this cohort, 4 cattle were found to be WB-positive for
PrP(Sc).
The results of the pilot studies are consistent with simulation results of
the Swiss BSE epidemic when assuming approximately 50% of the BSE-affected
animals in late incubation or with clinical signs of BSE are detected
through the mandatory reporting scheme. A large proportion of the remaining
animals in late incubation or with early clinical signs are likely to be
culled and therefore will be delivered to the specialized rendering plant.
Testing of all culled cattle should detect that segment of the BSE-affected
animals. Based on the simulation results, in 1999 between 15 and 20 animals
are predicted to appear in this population. Extrapolating the current test
results (4/1000) to the annually rendered population (5000 cattle) leads to
approx. 20 PrP(Sc)-positive animals to be expected, thereby supporting the
modeling results.
Switzerland is now initiating an active surveillance scheme to enhance the
detection of BSE cases in all segments of the adult cattle population. In
addition to the mandatory reporting of all suspect cases (based on clinical
neurological symptoms), all dead cattle showing at least 4 permanent teeth,
i.e. being over 24 months of age, that are brought to the rendering plant
(about 5000 / year) will be sampled. Additionally, brain samples will be
taken from all adult cattle subject to emergency slaughter (approximately
2000 / year), and from a random sample of cattle showing at least 4
permanent teeth at regular slaughter, bringing the total sample size up to
at least 13500 animals. All brain samples will be tested for the presence
of PrP(Sc) using the WB, and test-positive samples will be confirmed
through the Swiss reference laboratory for animal TSE [transmissible
spongiform encephalopathy.
It is expected in Switzerland that by using this testing scheme more
BSE-affected animals will be detected in 1999 than expected through
mandatory reporting alone. With the test systems currently available, this
scheme is considered to be a good approach to further evaluate the status
and monitor the development of the BSE epidemic in the national cattle
population. Details on the new Swiss surveillance system for BSE will also
be announced during a press conference on February 25, 1999.
