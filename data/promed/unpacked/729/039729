11 students at a Franklin elementary school have confirmed cases of
salmonella, and state health officials are investigating whether owl
pellets used in a class project were the source of the bacterial infection.
Most of the sick students are 5th-graders at Jefferson Elementary
School, said Bela Matyas, the medical director of epidemiology for
the state Department of Public Health.
In a biology experiment, 5th-graders at the school pick out bones in
owl pellets to identify animals, such as mice or chicks, the owls
might have eaten. The experiment has been conducted by generations of
students across the country. A few students with salmonella who were
not in the 5th grade may have gotten the disease from a peer, Matyas said.
Other possible sources of the infection include water from turtles in
the classrooms and food consumed by 5th-graders at an event. Matyas
said the department has ruled out school cafeteria food as a source.
The Health Department is interviewing students to determine their
relationships and how they might have been exposed to the bacteria.
It has also taken samples from the students and will test the owl
pellets and turtles' water.

Health officials in Franklin now think they know the source of
salmonella at Jefferson Elementary School.
At 1st, it was believed the illness was caused by a science
experiment using owl pellets. But now health officials believe a pet
turtle's dirty tank may have triggered the outbreak. At least 11
students were out sick. The bacteria is commonly passed from person
to person when hands aren't washed properly.

[The 2nd posting suggests a turtle source (more classically
described) for the student salmonellosis rather than the owl pellets,
but no information is given for that statement. No speciation of the
implicated organism is given either.
Salmonellosis can be acquired from owl pellets (regurgitated
indigestible remains of the owl meal) as demonstrated in these 2
reports from Minnesota. It appears to be the same outbreak reported
at different times but only once in a peer reviewed journal:

Last week, the Washington County Department of Public Health and
Environment investigated an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness and
fever among children attending 2 elementary schools. Approximately 40
were ill in one school and 4 in a 2nd school. 7 students (to date)
have had positive stool cultures for _Salmonella_ Typhimurium.
Illness was associated with being in the science club or attending an
after-school program that met at the same time and place as the
science club. Members of the science club dissected owl pellets (the
regurgitated remains of the owl's meal; this owl was being fed chicks
and mice) one to 4 days before onset of illness. The dissecting took
place on a cafeteria table that was not sanitized before re-use,
possibly accounting for additional cases. We provided assistance and
cultured owl pellets and fresh droppings from the owl; _Salmonella_
Typhimurium was isolated from both pellets and droppings. Additional
testing, including testing the meal source of chicks and mice and
molecular subtyping, is ongoing. Children should enjoy science
activities such as these as long as they wash their hands when they
are done with soap and water, and their work area should be sanitized.
- Smith KE, Anderson F, Medus C, Leano F, Adams J. Outbreaks of
salmonellosis at elementary schools associated with dissection of owl
pellets. Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2005 Summer;5(2):133-6.
_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhimurium outbreaks occurred at 2
elementary schools after science club students dissected owl pellets.
40 primary cases were identified (26 culture-confirmed). At the 1st
school, pellets were dissected on a cafeteria table, concurrent with
after-school child care in the cafeteria. Subsequently, the table was
not sanitized before use by after-school care students for snacks, or
before the next school lunch. At the 2nd school, pellets were
dissected in a dedicated science room, and fewer cases occurred.
Pellets in both outbreaks originated from a single captive barred
owl. The outbreak pulsed-field gel electrophoresis subtype of _S._
Typhimurium was isolated from the owl's pellets and feces and from 4
frozen chicks from a batch used to feed the owl. - Mod.LL]
