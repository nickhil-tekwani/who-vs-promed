A 2-year serology study using stringent criteria found antibodies to H5N1 avian flu in 2.1 percent of Egyptians exposed to poultry, a finding that National Institutes of Health (NIH) officials said demonstrates that the virus poses a low pandemic risk.

Scientists from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., and the National Research Center in Giza, Egypt, analyzed blood samples from 750 people with poultry exposure, 731 of whom were exposed to backyard poultry, according to their paper published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases [Oct 29 J Infect Dis http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/10/25/infdis.jiu529]. Of those, 455 (61.3 percent) reported daily exposure to poultry. They also collected serum samples from 250 people who had no poultry exposure. To avoid the cross-reactivity that can result from antibodies to H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, the researchers considered an antibody titer of 80 or higher to indicate seropositivity, which matches the World Health Organization diagnostic criterion. Measurements were taken at baseline (from November 2010 to July 2011), one year later and 2 years later.

They found that 15 of 708 poultry-exposed volunteers (2.1 percent) had antibodies to H5N1 at baseline, with the prevalence dropping to 0.4 percent after one year and 0.6 percent after 2 years. The control group had no seropositive results at all 3 test times. The team also found that seropositive rates for H9N2 antibodies were 1.1 percent at baseline, 7.5 percent after one year, and 5.9 percent after 2 years, compared with 0 percent, 0.7 percent, and 1.0 percent in controls, respectively. Regarding their H5N1 findings, the authors conclude, "This prevalence demonstrates that the number of cases is greatly underreported and that the case-fatality rate [CFR] is consequently greatly overestimated." They note, however, that, given Egypt's low CFR, the results might not apply to other regions.

In an accompanying commentary [http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/10/25/infdis.jiu530.short], David Morens, MD and Jeffery Taubenberger, MD, PhD of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, wrote: "While it is important to be vigilant about the potential risks posed by all influenza viruses, including A(H5N1), and while we cannot conclude that the A(H5N1) risk is nonexistent, we see no compelling virologic or epidemiologic evidence to suggest that A(H5N1) or any other avian influenza virus is currently evolving toward human transmissibility, let alone pandemicity, or that such viruses are even capable of doing so." They said that greater pandemic threats include reassortment of circulating H1N1 and H3N2 strains with zoonotic strains, lab release of the 1957 H2N2 pandemic strain, or evolving influenza strains in swine.

[A recent WHO listing of human cases of avian H5N1 influenza virus infection places Egypt 2nd among the 16 countries that have so far recorded human cases of avian H5N1 avian influenza. Egypt is ranked 2nd after Indonesia, another country where the population is frequently exposed to diseased fowl in domestic settings [see: http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/EN_GIP_20140727CumulativeNumberH5N1cases.pdf?ua=1]. Nonetheless, the analysis referred to above is reassuring that no more than 2.1 percent of the Egyptian population may have responded to exposure to avian H5N1 virus infection.

The publication is entitled: Avian Influenza A(H5N1) and A(H9N2) Seroprevalence and Risk Factors for Infection Among Egyptians: A Prospective, Controlled serological study by Mokhtar R. Gomaa and 11 others. Their abstract reads:

"- Background: A(H5N1) and A(H9N2) avian influenza viruses are enzootic in Egyptian poultry, and most A(H5N1) human cases since 2009 have occurred in Egypt. Our understanding of the epidemiology of avian viruses in humans remains limited. Questions about the frequency of infection, the proportion of infections that are mild or subclinical, and the case-fatality rate remain largely unanswered.
- Methods: We conducted a 3-year, prospective, controlled, sero-epidemiological study that enrolled 750 poultry-exposed and 250 unexposed individuals in Egypt.
- Results: At baseline, the seroprevalence of anti-A(H5N1) antibodies (titer, 80 or higher) among exposed individuals was 2 percent, significantly higher than that among the controls (0 percent). Having chronic lung disease was a significant risk factor for infection. Antibodies against A(H9N2) were not detected at baseline when A(H9N2) was not circulating in poultry. At follow-up, A(H9N2) was detected in poultry, and, consequently, the seroprevalence among exposed humans was between 5.6 percent and 7.5 percent. Vaccination of poultry, older age, and exposure to ducks were risk factors for A(H9N2) infection.
- Conclusions: Results of this study indicate that the number of humans infected with avian influenza viruses is much larger than the number of reported confirmed cases. In an area where these viruses are enzootic in poultry, human exposure to and infection with avian influenza becomes more common." - Mod.CP
