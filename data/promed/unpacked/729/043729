Indonesia: local sources claim outbreak in Alor is now contained
-----------------------------------------------
Local media report that the outbreak has been contained. Kupang Pos has an
article, from Thu 11 Nov 2004, the title of which, I am informed, is
translated "Strange Disease in Alor is Already Handled." They state that
223 children under the age of 5 were affected, and most are recovering.
Media Indonesia (Thu 11 Nov 2004) reported the death of 31 people in Alor.
Other sources have informed us that 6 patients have tested positive for
measles (IgM), but give no indication of how many were tested, and whether
any of those tests were negative for measles. The predominant symptoms were
high fever, rash, red eyes, and coryza consistent with measles. The only
feature felt to be unusual for measles in this local population was that
rash did not leave the usual hyper-pigmentation. The region is apparently
known to have poor vaccination coverage.

[Dr. Lai's distillation of local media sources indicates that this outbreak
is in decline and that the tests and description of the illness are
consistent with a diagnosis of measles in a poorly immunized population.
ProMED-mail appreciates Dr. Lai's assistance in clarifying the situation. -
