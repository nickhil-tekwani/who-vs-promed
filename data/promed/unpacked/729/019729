The Health Surveillance Unit (UVS) in Honduras reported an additional 3 mucormycosis, or "black fungus" cases on Friday [3 Sep 2021], bringing the total cases to 15 in a country that would normally see 1 or 2 cases.

"We had declared 12 cases of mucormycosis this week and that made us move to the hospitals to carry out investigations, (where) we were able to verify that there are 15 cases of mucormycosis already in the country," head of the UVS, Karla Pavon said.

She noted that the number of cases of mucormycosis registered in the Central American country is "something unusual".

Of the total number of confirmed cases of black fungus, which has been detected in patients with very specific pathologies who have contracted COVID-19, 10 have died from this cause, she added.

Pavon urged the population to get vaccinated against the coronavirus and maintain the biosecurity measures recommended by the health authorities to prevent the spread of the virus. The official said that people with diabetes are those who have the highest risk of contracting an infection from this type of fungus.

[Mucormycosis, also known as zygomycosis, are infections caused by fungi in the class Zygomycetes, composed of the orders Mucorales and Entomophthorales. The order Mucorales includes genera _Rhizopus_, _Rhizomucor_, _Mucor_, and _Cunninghamella_. These fungi are ubiquitous in the environment, found in soil and decaying vegetable matter. However, they are also found in the hospital environment, being isolated from nonsterile adhesive tape and tongue depressors, and being linked to nosocomial infections (1, 1a, 2). The clinical spectrum of mucormycosis ranges from cutaneous, rhino-orbital and rhino-orbito-cerebral, sinopulmonary, and disseminated infections, which are frequently fatal, especially in immunocompromised hosts.

Most human infections result from inhalation of fungal spores that have been released in the air or from direct inoculation of organisms into disrupted skin or mucosa. Although individuals are exposed to these fungi on a daily basis, usually only people with weakened immune systems or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus develop infections due to these organisms. However, contamination of devitalized tissue following traumatic injuries sustained during tornados, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions can result in mucormycosis even without underlying risk factors (3-5).

Nosocomial mucormycosis has been associated with a variety of healthcare-associated procedures or devices, such as cutaneous infection related to the direct inoculation of the fungus on the wound or skin surface, usually from contaminated wound bandages, contaminated karaya (a plant-derived adhesive used for ostomy bags), or contaminated medication patches. Mucormycosis has also followed the use of contaminated wooden tongue depressors to prepare oral medications given to patients through a nasogastric tube or to construct splints for intravenous and arterial cannulation sites, and aerosolized fungal spores in ventilatory systems as a result of construction (6). In another nosocomial outbreak, water damage to a linen store and patient shower room promoted fungal growth, which contaminated the surrounding air that circulated in close proximity to the infected patients' rooms (7). Nosocomial gastrointestinal mucormycosis has followed ingestion of contaminated food or medications (see the "see alsos" below).

These organisms characteristically are angioinvasive, often leading to thrombosis, infarction of involved tissues, septic embolization, and dissemination. Mucormycosis can have a rapid and often fatal clinical course. The diagnosis of mucormycosis almost always requires histopathologic evidence of fungal invasion of the tissues. Culturing these organisms from an infected site is rarely sufficient to establish the diagnosis because the fungus may colonize tissue without causing infection and is a relatively frequent laboratory contaminant.

Most cases of COVID-associated mucormycosis (CAM) have been reported from India, where it is occurring in 0.27% of hospitalized COVID patients (8-10). Although poorly controlled diabetes mellitus is the most common risk factor among CAM patients, 1/3 of CAM cases are reported to have no underlying predisposition, other than COVID (10). Severe COVID-19 is treated with high doses of corticosteroids, and improper glucocorticoid use in COVID-19 (e.g., use of glucocorticoids in mild COVID-19 cases (without hypoxaemia) or the utilization of higher doses of glucocorticoids) has been found to be an additional risk factor in CAM in India (10).

The fungi gain entry via inhalation into the paranasal sinuses and then spread to the sphenoid sinus, palate, orbit, and cavernous sinus. Mucormycosis usually develops 10-14 days after hospitalization for severe COVID-19. Perhaps mucor-contaminated swabs used for COVID PCR testing, done on admission to the hospital or as an outpatient, introduced fungal organisms into the nasal cavity at the time of testing. Mucormycosis that presents before a diagnosis of COVID-19 is made appears unusual (11).
