E. COLI - UK: MUSIC FESTIVAL SPREAD
***********************************

From: name withheld by request

At least 8 cases of E.coli O157 associated diarrhoea have been isolated
from people attending a music festival around 7 July at Glastonbury, UK.
Some of them involve children, and one case of HUS [haemolytic-uremic
syndrome, a dangerous complication] is suspected.
No common foodsource can be identified, but all cases have admitted having
contact with mud. The festival takes place on farmland -- heavy rains in
the previous weeks had left the site extremely muddy -- the UK press all
carried pictures of revellers
completely covered in mud.
As tens of thousands of people attended the festival, there is still
potential for this to become a far larger outbreak.
