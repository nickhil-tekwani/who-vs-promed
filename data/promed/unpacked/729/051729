Smallpox Vaccine Could Be Stretched
-----------------------------------
BOSTON: In the event of a bioterror attack using smallpox [i.e.,
Variola virus, health authorities could stretch the nation's limited
vaccine supply simply by diluting the 15 million doses that are on
hand, a government official said on Sun 17 Feb 2002.
Experiments to see whether diluted smallpox vaccine could still offer
protection against the disease have been "very successful," said
Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases. Fauci spoke in Boston at the annual meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.
The dilution experiments tested vaccines that had been [diluted to as
little as one-tenth their original concentration on 650 volunteers. The
data available so far do not show definitively that vaccines could be
diluted that much and still prevent smallpox. But it is clear that a
significant amount of dilution is possible, Fauci said. Conclusive data
were expected in March [2002.
To boost supplies of smallpox vaccine even further, the government
has also ordered more than 200 million doses from a British company,
to be delivered by the end of 2002. In the event of an attack, health
officials would use the new doses first, dipping into the diluted vaccine
only if those ran out or had not yet arrived.
The U.S. has no plans to offer widespread smallpox vaccination to the
public, because for the time being the vaccine is considered a greater
threat than the possibility of an attack. In rare cases the vaccine causes
health complications or death, and some experts estimate that
vaccinating the entire American population would kill 400 people and
permanently injure thousands more. The National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases is trying to develop improved smallpox
vaccines that do not have harmful side effects, Fauci said.

[I would have thought that, given the number of Americans living with
HIV, the number of deaths would be higher than 400. "Permanently
injured" would include 65-80% of recovered cases with more or less
disfiguring facial pockmarks, less than 1% with corneal opacities or
blindness, & less than 2%, mainly children, with subsequent limb bone
deformities (Fenner et al. 1988, Smallpox and its eradication, WHO
Geneva pp.47-50). - Mod.JW
