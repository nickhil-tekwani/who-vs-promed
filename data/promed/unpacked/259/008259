In ProMED-mail message number (04) it is stated that _Listeria
monocytogenes_ is carried in the intestines of animals and can easily come
in contact with raw vegetables, dairy products or uncooked meat. It is not
mentioned in that message that all six _Listeria_ spp., including _L.
monocytogenes_ can easily be found in the environment. And quite often post
process contamination occurs in (cooked meat) factories. Due to the long
shelf life of cooked meat products (in The Netherlands 4-6 weeks), even a
low contamination with very few cells of this pathogen can grow out to
numbers up to 1 million cfu/g during refrigerated storage.
It is not fully true that _L. monocytogenes_ thrives in refrigerators. The
atmosphere is rather dry. You may isolate the organism from the vegetable
compartment, but hardly from the walls. Contamination in the refrigerator
is not likely to occur, if food is stored in closed containers. And that is
the proper way to store food in the refrigerator, otherwise it will
desiccate. I think people are confused by the fact that _L. monocytogens_
can grow at refrigeration temperatures, and therefore think that this
pathogen is a danger in the refrigerator. Some people even think it is
necessary to disinfect their refrigerator. Cleaning when it looks dirty
will do in my opinion. More nice things about _Listeria_ are written in my
Ph.D. thesis, which is still available for a few persons (there are not so
many left).
