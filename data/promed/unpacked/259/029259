Mystery death of cattle stuns Rayan village
-----------------------------------------------
About 171 cows have died in the past 10 days for unknown medical
reasons in Rayan Talavdi village in Ajwa Taluka. Cattle owners and
veterinary doctors fear the deaths could have taken place due to the
spread of a dangerous epidemic in the village.
A large number of families, mostly shepherds, are involved in the
milk producing business in this village, which has around 960 cows
and buffaloes. "Surprisingly, cattle [have] been perishing one by one
in the last 10 days. On the 1st day, about 5 cows died. The cows 1st
vomited blood then fainted and died," said Vijay Bharwad, president
of the Rayan Talavdi milk production committee, which supplies milk
to Baroda Dairy. On Wed 9 Nov 2005, 4 more cows were reported dead.
3 camels and 4 buffaloes have also died in the village. "Since the
number of death[s] among the cattle is so huge, it is very difficult
to discharge their bodies. Stray dogs have also died after eating the
dead cattle. Maybe some dangerous epidemic has struck the village,"
said Mr. Bharwad. The veterinary doctors from Baroda Dairy have also
failed to ascertain the reason behind the deaths.
When asked about the delay in informing the government and municipal
authorities about the incident, cattle owners failed to give any
concrete answer. Meanwhile, Baroda district development officer M.
Thennarson said that 3 teams of doctors were sent to the village on
Wednesday [9 Nov 2005] evening to look into the matter. They will try
to diagnose the possible cause. "We will provide all possible help to
the villagers. The report will be forwarded to higher authorities in
Gandhinagar also, as the number of deaths is too high," said Mr.
Thennarson.

[If the described hemorrhagic symptoms and mortality in cattle and
the involvement of buffaloes, camels and dogs are accurate, anthrax
should be one of the 1st etiologies to be excluded, with the
population instructed about the public health aspects of the disease.
However, anthrax, usually, is a peracute disease in susceptible
cattle; it is not clear whether the described cases are such so that
other causes, including toxicological ones, are to be considered as
well. Further data will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
