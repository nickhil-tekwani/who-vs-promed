[Germany and other countries in Europe had a particularly difficult
problem with equine infectious anemia (EIA) in 2010, probably due to
infected horses imported from Romania.

In 2006, Germany had 7 outbreaks of EIA; 3 outbreaks in 2007; 2008 was
an unfortunate year with 10 outbreaks; there were 4 outbreaks in 2009;
27 outbreaks in the very difficult year of 2010, and finally this is
the 4th outbreak in 2011.

Although more infections do occur in the summer months when there is
higher prevalence of biting flies that transmit disease, the disease
can be transmitted by other means such as iatrogenic transmission with
dirty needles, etc. In both 2009 and 2010 there were a few outbreaks
reported in November and December. - Mod.PC]
