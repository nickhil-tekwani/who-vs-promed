WHO notes 15 million excess deaths over 2 COVID years
-----------------------------------------------------
In highly anticipated findings today [5 May 2022], the technical advisory group for the World Health Organization (WHO) released excess death data for 2020 and 2021, which suggest that the real COVID-19 number is nearly 3 times higher than officially reported. [https://www.who.int/news/item/05-05-2022-14.9-million-excess-deaths-were-associated-with-the-covid-19-pandemic-in-2020-and-2021]

The report also revealed other key trends, including that the pandemic has been deadlier for men and has exposed gaps in reporting.

'Behind these numbers are people'
---------------------------------
The WHO said the goal of the study was to clarify the true impact of the pandemic. The complex process of assessing deaths takes into account deaths directly related to COVID, but also assesses deaths from not receiving care when health systems were overwhelmed.

The estimates also take into account fatalities averted -- such as from car accidents and workplace injuries -- when COVID-19 measures were in place.

The WHO estimated there were 14.9 million excess deaths in 2020 and 2021, with a range between 13.3 million to 16.6 million. As of today [5 May 2022], the fatality count on the WHO's COVID-19 dashboard is 6.24 million.

Samira Asma, DDS, MPH, the WHO's assistant director-general for data, analytics, and delivery, said in a video press release that measuring excess deaths is key to understanding the true impact of the pandemic, important for both policymakers and the public. She added that accurate estimates help public health officials make targeted investments in public health and noted that the estimation process revealed an urgent need to invest in good data gathering. [https://who.canto.global/s/JKHO7?viewIndex=0&column=video&id=e0rtnp950p619esjt75e41ah5m]

Most important, the numbers are a reminder of the tragic loss of life, Asma said. "We have to remember that behind these numbers are people."

The WHO's expert group developed methods to produce mortality estimates, even when data were incomplete or unavailable. Their work included consultations in different countries.

Some regions experienced a larger death burden, with 84% concentrated in Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Americas.

The death toll was higher for men, who made up 57% of the deaths. As expected, fatalities were higher in older adults. Middle-income countries accounted for 81% of deaths, followed by high-income nations with 15% and low-income countries with 4%.

South Africa extends some measures
----------------------------------
South Africa stepped down its state of disaster for COVID-19 in early April [2022], but it kept a few transitional measures, such as wearing masks indoors in public places and on public transportation, that were set to expire today [5 May 2022], according to News24. Officials yesterday [4 May 2022], however, announced that the transitional measures remain in effect for 30 more days. [https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/breaking-masks-to-stay-as-govt-announces-limited-covid-19-regulations-before-current-ones-expire-20220504]

Amid rising cases over the past few weeks, fueled by the more transmissible BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants, officials are assessing whether the spike reflects impacts from the recent Easter holiday or is the start of a 5th surge. South Africa today [5 May 2022] reported 9757 new cases and 7 more deaths, with test positivity rising to 25.9%, up from 22.6% the previous day [4 May 2022].

In other global developments:
• Officials from the European Medicines Agency said today [5 May 2022] that it hopes to approve variant-adapted COVID-19 vaccines by September [2022] to allow for the rollout of new immunization campaigns in the fall [2022], according to Reuters. Trial data from clinical trials are expected over the next few months. [https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/ema-says-it-hopes-approve-covid-variant-adapted-vaccines-by-autumn-2022-05-05/]
• In China, health officials in Beijing -- hoping to avoid a lockdown similar to Shanghai's -- are still tracking local transmission chains, with 39 more cases reported today [5 May 2022].

US cases continue steady rise
-----------------------------
In the United States, several COVID-19 cases have been reported among journalists across several news organization who attended the White House Correspondents Association dinner on [30 Apr 2022], the New York Times reported yesterday [4 May 2022]. It's unclear how many cases are linked to the event, which had testing and vaccination protocols in place, but no mask rules. [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases]

Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who attended the event, is among those who are reporting infections. So far, President Joe Biden, who was also at the dinner, has tested negative.

The United States reported 114 308 new cases yesterday [4 May 2022], according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. The country's illness levels are the highest since late February [2022].

The 7-day average for new daily cases is 65 886, with 375 daily deaths, according to New York Times data. Cases are up 54% compared to a week ago, with hospitalizations up 19% and deaths showing a 3% decline. [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html]

Meanwhile, the country's death toll is approaching 1 million, with Johns Hopkins reporting 996 823. NBC News data show the US passed the 1 million fatality mark yesterday [4 May 2022]. [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/covids-toll-us-reaches-1-million-deaths-unfathomable-number-rcna22105]

[2] Vaccines
Date: Thu 5 May 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/05/studies-show-promise-2-new-covid-vaccine-platforms


Studies show promise for 2 new COVID vaccine platforms
------------------------------------------------------
Two studies based on phase 3 clinical trials published yesterday [4 May 2022] in the New England Journal of Medicine show promising results for 2 novel COVID-19 vaccine platforms -- a plant-based coronavirus-like particle vaccine, and a receptor-binding domain (RBD)-dimer-based vaccine.

And neither vaccine requires extreme cold chain storage, which makes them appealing candidates for low- and middle-income countries, a key component of global COVID-19 vaccination efforts.

Vaccines perform well despite variants
--------------------------------------
The 1st vaccine is a plant-based particle vaccine, developed by Medicago/GSK, and was tested on participants in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States from 15 Mar-2 Sep 2021.

The vaccine, CoVLP, was administered in 2 shots 21 days apart, and results were compared to placebo. The study continued until at least 160 COVID-19 cases were detected in participants at least 7 days following the 2nd dose of vaccine.

A total of 24 141 volunteers participated in the trial. Vaccine efficacy was 69.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 56.7% to 78.8%) against any symptomatic COVID-19 caused by 5 variants that were identified by sequencing, the authors found. Results were even stronger for efficacy against moderate-to-severe disease, at 78.8% (95% CI, 55.8% to 90.8%).

No severe cases or deaths were recorded in the vaccine group. The vaccine group had more adverse effects, but none were severe.

"CoVLP+AS03, like all currently deployed vaccines, was designed to target the original viral strain, but no case caused by this strain was identified," the authors said. "The context in which vaccines are currently being tested has clearly changed since early in the pandemic."

The authors said the performance of CoVLP is similar to current vaccines in use against current strains. [Citation: Karen J. Hager, Gonzalo Pérez Marc, Philipe Gobeil, et al. Efficacy and safety of a recombinant plant-based adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine. NEJM. 4 May 2022. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2201300]

Three-dose vaccine 88% effective against severe COVID
-----------------------------------------------------
The 2nd vaccine, ZF2001, was tested at 31 clinic sites in Uzbekistan, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Ecuador, and later in China. The vaccine is made by Anhui Zhifei Longcom of China.

Participants were randomized to receive placebo or 3 injections of vaccine administered 30 days apart. The trial took place from 12 Dec 2020 to 15 Dec 2021.

Only 158 of 12 625 participants in the ZF2001 group contracted COVID-19 during the trial, compared with 580 of 12 568 participants in the placebo group. Vaccine efficacy against infection was 75.7% (95% CI, 71.0% to 79.8%) and 87.6% (95% CI, 70.6% to 95.7%) against severe to critical disease.

Two participants in the vaccine group, and 12 in the placebo group, died of COVID-19, resulting in an 86.5% (95% CI, 38.9% to 98.5%) efficacy rate against death.

Genotype sampling from COVID-19 cases in the study showed primarily delta, alpha, and B.1.617.3 variants. The authors said vaccine efficacy was 76.1% (95% CI, 70.0% to 81.2%) against delta, 88.3% (95% CI, 66.8% to 97.0%) against alpha, and 75.2% (95% CI, 55.3% to 87.0%) against kappa.

"The high cross-protection conferred by ZF2001 (an antigen based on the Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence) against different SARS-CoV-2 variants is encouraging," the authors wrote. [Citation: Lianpan Dai, Lidong Gao, Lifeng Tao, et al. Efficacy and safety of the RBD-dimer-based COVID-19 vaccine ZF2001 in adults. NEJM. 4 May 2022. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2202261]

Multiple vaccine platforms needed
---------------------------------
Neither trial assessed how well the vaccines performed against asymptomatic infections, and both had very few participants over the age of 60. But in an editorial, Hanna Nohynek, MD, PhD, and Annelies Wilder-Smith, MD, PhD, write that the results seen in these trials are encouraging.

Currently 31 COVID-19 vaccines are already in large-scale use after conditional approval by national regulatory authorities or under the World Health Organization Emergency Use Listing, and more than 300 are in development.

Moreover, unlike this time last year [2021], global vaccine supply is now meeting demand. Still, the emergence of variants that can evade vaccine protection supports a broad range of COVID-19 vaccine platforms, the authors argue. Mix-and-match strategies may prove to be useful in future booster campaigns. And vaccines that don't require specialized cold-chain storage may prove useful in limited-resource settings.

"We should remain agile in fine-tuning the best use of COVID-19 vaccines for the greatest effect on global public health by acknowledging trade-offs," they write.

"With more vaccine platforms available, we can possibly improve decision making regarding the selection of a vaccine, since different vaccine platforms may be more suitable for certain age groups, certain subpopulations (e.g., those with underlying immune-compromising or other medical conditions), and pregnant women."

[Editorial. Hanna Nohynek and Annelies Wilder-Smith. Does the world still need new COVID-19 vaccines? NEJM. 4 May 2022. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMe2204695

"Although there was a global shortage of COVID-19 vaccines in 2021, by mid 2022, the vaccine supply will no longer be a limiting factor in efforts to provide more equitable coverage. As of 19 Apr 2022, approximately 11.5 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered globally. Scaling up manufacturing capacity for currently available vaccines at the speed promised by vaccine producers through the COVAX (COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access) program and beyond should secure the coverage target projected by the World Health Organization (WHO) for 70% of the world population by mid 2022. So why do we still need new COVID-19 vaccines?

"A total of 344 COVID-19 vaccine candidates have been developed or are still in development. Of these, 31 vaccine products are already in large-scale use after conditional approval by national regulatory authorities or under the WHO Emergency Use Listing. At least 5 different technology platforms have been used (i.e., messenger RNA [mRNA], viral-vectored, inactivated whole-virus, protein subunit, and plasmid DNA approaches). Several of the inactivated whole-virus and protein subunit vaccines need adjuvants to potentiate the immune response.

"Many reasons dictate a need for the development of a range of COVID-19 vaccines available for use across the world with the aim of bringing the pandemic under control. Each vaccine product has different attributes and advantages and disadvantages, and multiple factors must be considered to guide policy decisions. Different countries and health care settings, as well as different subpopulations and age groups, may benefit from different vaccine products developed on different platforms. Efficacy and safety, as evaluated in phase 3 trials, are not the sole outcomes to be assessed in a country's decision to procure and introduce new COVID-19 vaccines. Ease of schedules, vaccine effectiveness when used in routine programs, need and frequency of boosters, cost, considerations regarding cold-chain logistics, manufacturing scalability, acceptability by communities, and scope for local or regional production are additional important factors.

"To this end, we commend the development of 2 new vaccines, as now described in 2 articles in the Journal, one by Hager et al. and one by Dai et al. Both of these COVID-19 vaccines are produced on new technology platforms: Hager et al. describe a plant-based coronavirus-like particle vaccine, and Dai et al., a receptor-binding domain (RBD)-dimer-based vaccine. Both vaccines have the advantage of not requiring extreme cold-chain procedures for storage, which makes them user-friendly in primary health care settings as well as in low- and middle-income countries, and it is important that such countries were included in the phase 3 trials of these vaccines. The time period of both trials covered the circulation of several SARS-CoV-2 variants, but the trials were completed before the emergence of the B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant and subvariants."

"The 1st COVID-19 vaccines used during the pandemic may not be the best long-term solution. The next generation of COVID-19 vaccines will need to have broader epitope coverage to provide cross-immunity against SARS-CoV-2 variants, confer a longer duration of protection, and be easy to update in a timely manner for protection against any new variants. We should remain agile in fine-tuning the best use of COVID-19 vaccines for the greatest effect on global public health by acknowledging trade-offs. With more vaccine platforms available, we can possibly improve decision making regarding the selection of a vaccine, since different vaccine platforms may be more suitable for certain age groups, certain subpopulations (e.g., those with underlying immune-compromising or other medical conditions), and pregnant women. We may increasingly need to mix and match vaccines to leverage the benefits of each of these platforms. Finally, currently available vaccines have only modest effectiveness against mild infection and transmission, which is further reduced in the context of the newly emerging omicron subvariants. Hence, to slow down the circulation of the virus and to limit the speed at which further variants emerge, new vaccines that have a substantial effect on reducing mild infection and transmission are needed, even as the world attempts to learn how to live with SARS-CoV-2.

"These are tall orders for vaccine developers and manufacturers, but our mandate remains to develop the best tools to prevent the emergence of new variants of concern and control the health and socioeconomic fallout from new surges. The decision by representatives of the African region to establish a network of 6 mRNA technology hubs is a sign that countries and regions are motivated to build local and regional capacity and expand self-sufficiency not only in planning and participating in key clinical trials but also in designing and manufacturing vaccines to better meet the needs of their populations during pandemic threats. Such technology hubs will need to embrace technologies beyond the mRNA approach."]

[3] J&J vaccine

FDA limits J&J COVID vaccine as dose shortage looms
---------------------------------------------------
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) yesterday [5 May 2022] severely restricted use of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) COVID-19 vaccine as federal budget documents herald a vaccine shortage this fall [2022] if 2nd boosters are widely encouraged.

Blood clots with the J&J vaccine
--------------------------------
In the 14 months after gaining an emergency use authorization, the J&J one-dose vaccine yesterday [5 May 2022] hit another obstacle, when the FDA limited its use to certain individuals, citing rare but serious blood clotting events following vaccination.

The FDA said the agency has now identified 60 confirmed cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TSS), including 9 fatal cases, among 18 million recipients of the vaccine. The agency now recommends that only people who would not get a COVID-19 vaccine otherwise, or who may be allergic to mRNA vaccines, receive the J&J shot.

"We recognize that the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine still has a role in the current pandemic response in the United States and across the global community. Our action reflects our updated analysis of the risk of TTS following administration of this vaccine and limits the use of the vaccine to certain individuals," said Peter Marks, MD, PhD, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in an FDA press release. [https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-limits-use-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-certain-individuals]

The adenovirus-based vaccine was once considered a game-changer, as it was easier to administer and store than the mRNA vaccines, and required only one visit to a vaccine provider. But within weeks of gaining FDA authorization last spring [2021], the agency said they were aware of 9 cases of TSS. Use of the vaccine was then paused for 10 days, and the vaccine quickly fell out of favor with Americans -- 200 million of whom have received either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine products.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID Data Tracker shows 66.3% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 77.7% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 45.9% of those eligible have received their 1st booster dose.

The US reported 72 158 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [5 May 2022], and 242 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. The 7-day average of new daily cases is 67 827, with 286 daily deaths, according to the Washington Post tracker.

Possible 1 Sep 2022 cutoff for vaccines
---------------------------------------
In funding news, budget documents indicate that the Biden administration could run out of COVID-19 vaccines by [1 Sep 2022] if it moves forward with plans to encourage all adults to get a 2nd booster shot, Stat reports. [https://www.statnews.com/2022/05/06/white-house-documents-detail-a-looming-squeeze-on-covid-19-boosters/]

Currently, adults 50 and older and those immunocompromised are recommended to get a 2nd booster -- or 4 shots total for mRNA vaccines -- but many experts believe that recommendation will widen before this fall [2022].

In other federal news, over 260 travel industry and business organizations are calling on the Biden administration to end its COVID-19 testing requirement for vaccinated international passengers entering the country, Axios reports.

[About 17 million Americans have now gotten one dose of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, and another 1.5 million have gotten a booster dose, according to the C.D.C.'s data. By comparison, more than 200 million Americans have gotten at least 2 doses of either Moderna's or Pfizer's vaccine.

The risk of TTS [thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome] appears to be greatest -- 1 in 100 000 -- in women ages 30-49. The risks of infection with the virus are greater than the risks of the J&J vaccine. If you got the J&J shot, your risk of TTS would be expected to be low. In terms of timing, all of these cases were identified within 2 weeks of the person receiving the vaccine.

"Close to 20% of COVID-19 patients in the ICU develop blood clots, [Dr. Hyung Chun, MD, a Yale Medicine cardiologist] says. "That's far higher than what you'd expect for patients who are in the ICU for different conditions. Estimates I've seen are in the 3 to 10% range for patients admitted for other reasons," adds Dr. Chun.

"COVID-19 infection seems to cause the blood vessels and the blood itself to behave in a way that promotes formation of blood clots, which is likely a key driver for poor outcomes, sometimes damaging vital organs and even leading to death, Dr. Chun says.

"Dr. Chun and colleagues published a study in The Lancet Haematology after identifying a leading mechanism behind blood clots in COVID-19 patients. Yale Medicine hematologist Alfred Lee, MD, PhD, and George Goshua, MD, a hematology-oncology fellow, were also authors of the study. They found that endothelial cells (cells that line the blood vessels) play a surprising role in the formation of blood clots, especially as a COVID-19 patient becomes critically ill. They hope the finding will eventually contribute to determining treatment for the blood clots. So far, "there is not a clear-cut answer," Dr. Chun says."

- The Americas region reported 27.6% of cases and 53.6% of deaths during the past 24 hours. The region has reported more than 153.61 million cases, 2nd to the European region as the most severely affected region. The USA reported 96 199 cases in the last 24 hours followed by Brazil, Canada, Puerto Rico, Martinique, Panama and Chile -- all reporting more than 1000 cases. Additionally, Guatemala, Peru, Trinidad & Tobago, Barbados and Cayman Islands reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases in the last 24 hours. Argentina, Mexico, Columbia, Bolivia and Uruguay, among others, did not report cases over the last 24 hours.

- The European region reported 38.7% of cases and 30.1% of deaths over the last 24 hours. The region is the most affected, with cumulative cases exceeding 216.34 million. Some countries reporting few or no cases in the last 24 hours or longer include Spain, Netherlands, Ukraine, Belgium (12 cases), Switzerland, Hungary and Tajikistan. A total of 10 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours: no country reported more than 100 000 cases, 4 reported more than 10 000, and 6 reported over 1000 cases, while 8 other countries reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported no cases and deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 21.70 million cases. Overall, the reporting from the region has declined considerably over the last few days. Whether this low trend is attributable to reduced reporting on account of Ramadan and Eid-ul Fitr, or an actual reduction, should become clear in the coming days.

- The African region reported 1.9% of daily cases and 3.2% of deaths during the past 24 hours. The region has reported a cumulative total of more than 8.80 million cases. South Africa (9757) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours followed by Eswatini (224). Most of the remaining (12 reporting) countries reported fewer than 100 cases. A total of 42 countries did not report any cases over the last 24 hours.

- The Western Pacific region reported 29.4% of daily case numbers and 7.8% of deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 55.55 million cases. Australia (54 842), reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours followed by China, South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, Vietnam, and Malaysia.

- The South East Asia region reported 2.2% of daily newly reported cases and 5.1% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 57.92 million cases. Thailand (7705) reported the highest number of cases followed by India (3545) and Indonesia (245). Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and the rest did not report cases over the last 24 hours.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 11.0%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 16.1%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 21.5% increase in daily reported cases and a 48.6% increase (on account of possible bulk reporting of 1932 cases on 4 May 2022) in reported deaths. This shows an overall global trend of decreasing cases and deaths (the US has shown an increasing trend in cases and deaths over the last few days).

Impression: The global daily reported over 0.74 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 516.61 million cumulative reported cases and more than 6.27 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
