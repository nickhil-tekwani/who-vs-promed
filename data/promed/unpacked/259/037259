Cassava disease outbreak in E. Visayas
--------------------------------------
An outbreak of a disease, predicted to cut cassava output in Eastern
Visayas by at least 50 percent in 2011/2012, is spreading, the
Philippine Root Crop Research and Training Center (PhilRootcrops) has
warned.

Erlinda Vasquez, PhilRootcrops, said a large number of phytoplasma
[infections] known as witches' broom has been discovered in 70
hectares of cassava in Leyte and Southern Leyte. They are also
investigating reports that 3 Samar provinces have also been affected.

"The disease will place a huge strain on cassava production," Vasquez
said. "It will affect the incomes of small farmers and many laborers.
Cassava is one of the staple foods in Eastern Visayas and is also
processed into animal feed."

PhilRootcrops has issued preliminary management guidelines to help
tackle the outbreaks. The spread is almost certainly caused by the
movement of infected planting material. "Our immediate response is to
impose strict quarantine regulations on the movement of cassava,
especially the stems used as planting material," Vasquez said. Farmers
were also advised to observe proper sanitation by maintaining a
debris-free field.

"At present, we are conducting exhaustive surveys to cover the entire
region to completely determine the infected areas," Vasquez said.

[Witches' broom disease of cassava is caused by Cassava witches' broom
phytoplasma (synonym Cassava phyllody phytoplasma; _Candidatus_
Phytoplasma asteris group). It can seriously affect starch content of
tubers, and yield losses up to 80 percent have been reported in the
Americas. Symptoms may include excessive proliferation of branches
('witch's brooms'), small leaves, shortened internodes, purple
discolouration of 'brooms,' stunting and loss of plant vigour.
Characteristically, shoot distortion or leaf chlorosis are not
normally observed. Tubers are reduced in size with rough textured skin
and brown streaks in the flesh. Moderate temperatures between 13 and
20 degC favour disease development, symptoms become less obvious or
even disappear at higher temperatures.

The disease is mainly spread by vegetative propagation of the crop.
Mechanical transmission has also been reported, but no insect vectors
are known. Disease management relies on the use of certified clean
planting material. Thermotherapy followed by meristem tip culture can
be used to obtain phytoplasma-free tissue culture lines for
propagation.
