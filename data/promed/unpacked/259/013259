An outbreak of infections from _Listeria monocytogenes_ that was traced to certain soft cheeses has been declared over by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

As of 14 May [2021] there were 13 confirmed patients. A dozen of the patients were so sick they had to be admitted to hospitals. One patient died. The sick people live in 4 states. Their illnesses started on dates ranging from 20 Oct 2020 to 17 Mar 2021, with 12 illnesses occurring in 2021, according to the CDC.

The implicated cheese products are past their shelf life and should no longer be available for sale, according to an update from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, it can take up to 70 days after exposure for symptoms of _Listeria_ infection to develop. Because of the long incubation time, anyone who has eaten any of the implicated cheese should monitor themselves in the coming weeks for signs of infection.

The cheese was recalled in February [2021]. The queso fresco cheeses made by El Abuelito Cheese Inc. affected by the recall are:

Sick people ranged in age from less than 1 to 75 years, with a median age of 52. Twelve people were Hispanic, and 7 people were female.

Public health investigators used the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that were part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole-genome sequencing (WGS). WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples were closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak likely got sick from the same food.

Connecticut officials collected samples of El Abuelito brand Hispanic-style fresh and soft cheeses for testing from a store where a sick person reported buying these types of cheeses. On 19 Feb 2021, WGS showed that the _Listeria_ bacteria in El Abuelito brand queso fresco were closely related to the _Listeria_ bacteria from sick people in this outbreak. This means that people likely got sick from eating this cheese.

On 19 Feb 2021, El Abuelito Cheese Inc. recalled all queso fresco products made at their facility. They also stopped producing and distributing all their products.

Food contaminated with _Listeria monocytogenes_ may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections. Anyone who ate any recalled product and developed symptoms of _Listeria_ infection should seek medical treatment and tell their doctors about the possible _Listeria_ exposure.

Also, anyone who has eaten any of the recalled products should monitor themselves for symptoms during the coming weeks because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to _Listeria_ for symptoms of listeriosis to develop. Symptoms of _Listeria_ infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache, and neck stiffness. Specific laboratory tests are required to diagnose _Listeria_ infections, which can mimic other illnesses.

Pregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people such as cancer patients who have weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of serious illnesses, life-threatening infections, and other complications. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flulike symptoms, their infections can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or even stillbirth.

[A particular manufacturer's queso fresco cheese (El Abuelito Cheese Inc.) has been confirmed as the source for the multistate outbreak of listeriosis involving 13 confirmed cases in 4 states, with one death. It is now well over 70 days since recall on 19 Feb 2021 of all El Abuelito Cheese Inc. queso fresco products made at their facility. With an incubation period of 70 days, more cases are unlikely.

Queso fresco ("fresh cheese"), Hispanic-style soft, unaged white cheese, is made by curdling milk; it can be made with either pasteurized or unpasteurized (raw) milk. It is considered safe when made with pasteurized milk, but _Listeria_ contamination may occur after pasteurization. Latin-style soft cheese has been implicated in 65% of outbreaks and 54% of cases of listeriosis linked to soft cheeses (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6004860/).

Cheeses made from unpasteurized milk can be sold within US states that permit sale of raw dairy products. However, the US FDA prohibits interstate commerce of fresh, unaged (uncured) cheeses made from unpasteurized milk. FDA regulations do permit interstate distribution of raw milk cheeses, if aged (cured) for more than 60 days at a temperature of not less than 35 deg F [1.7 deg C] because aging/ripening of cheese for at least 60 days is thought to reduce bacterial contamination (http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2011/02/publishers-platform-60-day-rule-the-facts/#.WMWFxLGZPjA). However, aging raw milk cheese for 60 days may not totally ensure safety when _L. monocytogenes_ is introduced as a post-processing contaminant (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18724749).

In the USA, the CDC identifies clusters of possibly related cases of listeriosis based on clinical isolates of _L. monocytogenes_, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue) that have similar genotypes based on whole-genome sequencing. These isolates had been forwarded to state public health laboratories for genotyping, the results of which had been submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance (https://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/outbreak-detection/index.html).

When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the _Listeria_ case report from patients in the cluster to identify a common source.

Food items likely to be contaminated with _Listeria_, in addition to soft cheeses, include ready-to-eat refrigerated meat products that do not require further cooking before eating, such as smoked salmon, sushi, and cold cut meats. Even if initial contamination adds only a few _Listeria_ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods because _L. monocytogenes_ can multiply at refrigerator temperatures to a sufficient number to cause disease.

People at increased risk for disseminated listeriosis, which include pregnant women (and their newborns), adults aged 65 years or older, and people with weakened immune systems, should avoid eating food potentially contaminated with _Listeria_.

Once a cluster is identified, PulseNet works with other federal food regulatory agencies -- the US FDA and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) -- to find isolates found in food-monitoring programs that have similar genotypes, which would implicate them as the common source. - Mod.ML
