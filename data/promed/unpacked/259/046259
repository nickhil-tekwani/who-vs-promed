In reply to the question on the Salmonella cases in Kansas and Missouri,
here is some information you may find interesting.
An unusually high number of cases of _Salmonella infantis_ infections has
been reported in Kansas. As of 5/8, the total number of confirmed cases is
26 Kansas residents and 7 Missouri residents. Usually, between 4 and 6 cases
are reported in Kansas every year. The first case had a date of onset on
2/27. The last case reported had a date of onset on 4/28. Most cases
occurred among young adults (median age 29, range 8-67 years). Sixty-three
percent of the cases are women. Almost all the cases live in four counties
in Northeast Kansas and in the Kansas City, Missouri area (just across the
Northeastern state border). Many of the cases experienced moderate to severe
symptoms, including bloody diarrhea and fever. Several individuals sought
medical care at emergency room departments, and about 30% were hospitalized.
Milder cases may also have occurred, but perhaps they did not seek medical
attention, or did not provide a sample for stool culture, or their cultures
were not serotyped.
An epidemiologic investigation was launched by the Kansas Department of
Health and Environment on April 17 and is still in progress. Epidemiologists
from the state department have been working to try identify the source of
this outbreak, and they have been consulting with epidemiologists from the
foodborne and diarrheal disease branch at the CDC. The cases do not have any
apparent common exposure (like eating a the same restaurant, consuming the
same food, or purchasing groceries from the same site). However, PFGE tests
(performed at the Minnesota Department of Health laboratory) showed that 19
of the cases tested so far were caused by bacteria with indistinguishable
patterns, suggesting a common source of infection. (One case from Missouri
and one from Oklahoma had different patterns, and they are not included in
the case-count above. The tests on the other isolates are still pending.)
Surveillance in the area has been enhanced and as new cases are being
reported more timely, we hope to be able to obtain a better food history
from them that can help us find the source of this outbreak.
In regard to the question of the Tennessee cases, as far as I know there was
an outbreak of _Salmonella infantis_ in that state in March that was
attributed to consumption of contaminated food from the same BBQ restaurant,
possibly as a result of the presence of an infected food handler. Some
isolates from those cases have been also sent to Minnesota to rule out any
connection with the Kansas and Missouri cases.
