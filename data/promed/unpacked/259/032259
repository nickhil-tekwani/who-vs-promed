The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the [Hong Kong] Department of Health today [25 Jul 2013] provided an update on its investigation into a suspected case of Japanese encephalitis (JE) involving a 13-year-old boy.

Upon laboratory testing by the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch of the CHP, the patient's 2nd serum specimen taken this morning tested negative for antibodies against JE.

"The latest laboratory finding suggests that the patient is not suffering from JE," a CHP spokesman remarked.

The patient, with good past health, has developed fever, headache and dizziness since [15 Jul 2013]. He was admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital on [19 Jul 2013] with confused speech and transferred to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit on [20 Jul 2013]. The clinical diagnosis is encephalitis.

He is now receiving further management in the general ward in stable condition.

[Although this case has been shown not to be a Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection, there have been 2 previous cases in Hong Kong this year (2013) that are positive for this virus infection (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20130723.1840352). Hong Kong is well within the geographic distribution of JEV, so it would not be surprising to see additional cases occur.
