Sindh Minister for Livestock Mir Abid Hussain Jatoi has formed a task
force comprising 14 officers for reporting diseases in animals and
taking preventive measures. He directed the officers concerned to
prepare a provincial and district level urgent contingency plan to
control the increasing occurrence of a new [see comment] animal
disease, namely peste des petits ruminants (PPR) with immediate
effect.

This he directed while addressing a meeting of the officers of the
Livestock Department held here [Hyderabad] at the Departments
Committee Room, a statement said Sunday [19 Jul 2009]. The Minister
said PPR disease is increasing at an alarming level and out of 279
samples taken from sheep and goats of different parts of Sindh, more
than 200 have been found positive. He directed the officers to launch
mass vaccination in the epidemic-struck areas and ring vaccination in
endemic areas with the help of breeders.

The minister directed the officers of the task force, who were
assigned special areas for monitoring the disease, to immediately
report about its occurrence in animals so that special teams of
veterinary doctors could be dispatched there immediately. He said the
animals are the main source of income for poor people of rural areas,
and the government has launched many projects to help breeders and to
bring down the poverty ratio in rural areas and raise animal
production at the national level.

[PPR (peste des petit ruminants; also known as kata,
pseudorinderpest, and stomatitis-pneumoenteritis complex) is an acute
contagious disease caused by a morbillivirus in the family
_Paramyxoviridae_, antigenically very similar to the rinderpest
virus. It affects small ruminants and occasionally wild animals.

PPR causes considerable economic losses, with mortality --
particularly in goats -- sometimes exceeding 50 per cent in infected
flocks. The clinical disease, which resembles rinderpest in cattle,
is usually acute, characterised by severe pyrexia (which can last for
3-5 days), serous ocular and nasal discharges, erosive mouth lesions,
and diarrhoea; but unlike rinderpest, pneumonia is a part of the
syndrome. At necropsy, characteristic zebra markings may occur in the
large intestine but are not a consistent finding. Lesions also occur
in the lungs, showing congestion or bronchopneumonia when associated
with bacterial infection.

PPR occurs in countries in Africa lying between the equator and the
Sahara, including countries of the Horn of Africa; since the late
1980s, the disease has spread to the Arabian Peninsula, throughout
most of the Middle Eastern countries, and eastwards. Outbreaks of PPR
are now known to be common in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan,
Afghanistan, and China (Tibet). Recently, the disease spread into
north Africa.

Some experts are of the opinion that PPR was present in the Indian
subcontinent before it was "discovered" in West Africa, supposing
that it was transported to West Africa by sailing ship when trade was
carried out by that means and the vessels came round the Cape of Good
Hope. See the chapter on PPR, authored by W. Taylor, in Diseases of
Sheep, editor Ian Aitken, 4th edition, Blackwell Publishing 2007.
