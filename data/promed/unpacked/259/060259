Canker found in Highlands County
------------------------------------------------
More than 18 000 orange trees will be destroyed and burned in Highlands
County this week, after citrus canker was found in an 850-acre grove near
Cornwell. [The county] is the state's third-largest citrus-producing county
[and the 11th county to be affected by the disease].
Since 1995, more than 2.1 million citrus trees have been destroyed in an
effort to stop the spread of the bacterial disease. Citrus trees have been
removed in Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade, Martin, Hendry, Collier,
Manatee, Brevard, DeSoto, and Hillsborough counties.
Liz Compton, spokeswoman for the state's citrus canker eradication program,
said Wednesday that about 100 infected trees had been identified so far in
Naranja Grove, which is owned by Premier Partners III Ltd. of Chicago.
Compton said all ... trees within a 1900-foot radius of the infected trees,
as allowed by state law, will be uprooted ...and burned on-site. 150 acres
will be destroyed.
The find prompted Florida Citrus Mutual growers' organization in Lakeland
to issue a plea on behalf of panicked growers for an end to "delaying
tactics" from South Florida, where residents have sought injunctions
against the state cutting healthy trees within 1900 feet of infected trees.
According to Andy Lavigne, spokesperson for the ... growers' organization,
...legal challenges by South Florida growers are wasting taxpayers' money,
thus allowing the disease to spread further and infect other residents'
healthy trees.

[Citrus canker is caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv.
_citri_. The pathogen causes significant crop losses in various citrus
species. Eradication of infected trees is the only feasible management
strategy. The situation in Florida is complicated by the difficulty in
detecting and eradicating infected trees, the determination of residents to
continue to grow citrus in back yards near commercial orange groves, and
legal challenges to a Florida state law which requires removal of affected
trees. - Mod.DH]
