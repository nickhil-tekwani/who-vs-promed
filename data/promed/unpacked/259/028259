Health officials in Yemen say they have detected around 50 new cases of
polio, on top of the 369 cases already confirmed in the country. Abdul
Hakeem Al Radami, the official overseeing efforts to bring the outbreak
under control in Yemen, announced the new cases at a press conference to
launch a nationwide campaign to immunise vulnerable children, the Emirates
newspaper Gulf new reports.
Al Radami said the new cases were discovered in 3 provinces where parents
refused to let their children be vaccinated because of a lack of confidence
and lack of awareness about how dangerous the disease is. Many families are
skeptical because the outbreak of the potentially fatal disease began
following a routine national immunisation programme.
On Monday, the Ministry of Public Health and Population launched a 2-day
campaign, sending out 34 580 health workers to go door-to-door, immunising
some 4 million children under 5. Each house where children have been
immunised will be marked, and special ink will be put on the fingernails of
every immunised child.
Polio is a highly infectious viral disease that invades the nervous system
and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours. The World Health
Organisation declared Yemen polio-free in 1996. Only 6 countries in the
world are considered polio-endemic: Nigeria, India, Pakistan, Niger,
Afghanistan and Egypt. It is thought the disease may have spread from
Nigeria to 12 other African countries, including Sudan.
Meanwhile, Yemen's neighbour Saudi Arabia is putting stricter measures into
place ahead of the Haj pilgrimage in January, to stop the disease spreading
there. All children under 15 travelling to the holy city of Mecca from the
19 countries considered most "at risk" will be immunised on the spot.
Every year more than 2 million pilgrims travel to Saudi Arabia to take part
in the pilgrimage, which all fit, healthy Muslims are expected to undertake
at least once in their lives.
"The Haj period is important because of the large number of movements of
people from around the world into one location," Gulf News quoted Bruce
Aylward, coordinator of the Global Polio Eradication Programme for the UN
World Health Organisation, as saying. "But this year it is especially
important because a lot of the people travelling to Saudi come from
polio-infected countries," he said.
More than 1050 children are reported to have been paralysed by polio so far
in 2005 alone, mostly in Nigeria. [According to the most recent information
available on the polio eradication website, 453 of the 1053 cases reported
as of 16 Aug 2005 were from Nigeria, representing 43 percent of cases
reported this year.

[As of 16 Aug 205 there were 415 confirmed cases of polio reported from
Yemen, which would go along with the above newswire report.

In the last ProMED-mail posting on this outbreak, there were 369 cases
report (8 Aug 2005). The identification of pockets of susceptibles due to
intentional refusal to vaccinate is disconcerting. - Mod.MPP]
