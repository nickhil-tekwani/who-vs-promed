What are practices in other countries? How extensively is animal waste used
in animal feed? What are the effects on human health?
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for
Veterinary Medicine (CVM) at its web page
<http://www.fda.gov/cvm/fda/infores/consumer/litter.htm>, states the
following about the use of recycled animal waste in animal feed:
Recycled animal waste is a processed feed product for livestock derived
from animal manure or a mixture of manure and litter. Animal wastes contain
significant percentages of protein, fiber, and essential minerals and have
been deliberately incorporated into animal diets for their nutrient
properties for almost 40 years. Incorporation of this product into animal
diets is a viable alternative to land application or land fill.
The recycling of animal waste as a feed ingredient is primarily a local
practice. The bulk and weight of the product are such that transportation
costs for significant shipment across State lines is generally uneconomical.
Generally, animal waste is used within the State where it is produced. Many
State feed control agencies have taken the initiative in establishing
standards regarding the use of processed animal waste as a feed ingredient.
Because it is generally used within the State where it is produced and the
States have the capacity to effectively regulate its use, FDA policy is not
to take an active surveillance role in regulating the use of processed
animal waste as an animal feed ingredient [policy citation omitted.
This policy does not constitute an endorsement of the use of recycled
animal waste in animal feed, nor has FDA classified recycled animal waste
as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) or as an approved food additive. FDA
may still take regulatory action if shipment of waste across State lines
which presents a health hazard is brought to the Agency's attention, and
the State(s) involved cannot take appropriate regulatory action.
FDA expects the States to require this product to conform to the
definitions promulgated by the Association of American Feed Control
Officials (AAFCO) <http://www.aafco.org>, as published in its "Official
Publication" and as described in its "Model Regulations for Processed
Animal Waste Products as Animal Feed Ingredients."

[To see the extent of use, one needs only to read the 22 Sept 99 posting
from ProMED on Feces as Animal Feeds - Europe and 23 Sept 99 posting on
Feces as Animal Feeds- Europe (02) (which should have been Feces as Animal
Feeds- United States). How extensively animal waste being used in feeds is
a question I cannot precisely answer, other than to say from where I am,
the number of animal producers and veterinary practitioners I visit with
indicates it is a very wide spread practice. Perhaps some one else can
address practices in their state or the effects on human health. It really
doesn't matter if it is "on the books" as being against FDA policy or
against the law, the reality is these regulations are not being enforced
and until they are, the practice is likely to continue. - Mod.TG
