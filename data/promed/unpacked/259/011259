Wave of deaths hits Bangladesh zoo
----------------------------------
Grubby cages, inexperienced keepers and poor equipment have long
sullied the reputation of Dhaka's zoo, but now a string of deaths has
led to charges of serious incompetence against its management.

A total of 21 animals, including a Bengal tiger, a lion, a giraffe, a
zebra and a tapir, have died at the government zoo in the Bangladeshi
capital this year [2009] alone, triggering the suspension of 2 senior
keepers last week. Reza Khan, Bangladesh's top wildlife expert who now
heads Dubai Zoo in the United Arab Emirates, told AFP the number of
deaths was "abnormally high" and that poor conditions amounted to
"torture" for the animals. [An understatement. - MHJ] "Dhaka zoo is
run by vets who don't know the eating habits and wildlife environment
of the animals they keep," he said by telephone from Dubai. "Their
cages and enclosures have been built without adhering to international
standards."

The zoo has applied 7 times to become a member of the World
Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) and has been repeatedly
turned down for not meeting membership standards.

Wildlife Trust of Bangladesh chief Professor Anwarul Islam said it was
no surprise the animals were dying because the facility lacked the
know-how to care for wild animals. "The zoo authorities do not have
any wildlife experts, nor any wildlife biologist. And the
veterinarians cannot properly maintain the zoo, which is for wildlife
animals, not for livestock," he said. "One thing the authorities
should understand is that livestock and wildlife are not the same
thing."

The zoo is home to about 2000 animals from 130 species and stretches
over a 753 000-square-metre (186-acre) park, one of the few open
spaces in a crowded city that is home to more than 12 million people.
Most days 8000 people visit the zoo, undeterred by unkempt and drab
cages which are badly in need of a new coat of paint and are blighted
by rubbish, including an old shoe that lay in the crocodile enclosure
when AFP visited.

Dr Shakif Ul Azam, the zoo's only veterinarian, insists the deaths
were a result of natural causes, but he concedes that zoo staff lack
expertise and technical equipment. "We don't have so much space for
the animals to roam. Some of the enclosures are small. If we had
better instruments to treat them, it would be helpful for us to
investigate diseases," he said.

Without WAZA membership, the zoo is unable to take part in animal
exchanges that would bring in fresh attractions. Instead, the
Bangladeshi government spent USD 800 000 last year [2008] to bring 38
animals from South Africa to Dhaka through a private contractor. Of
those, a giraffe, 2 antelopes, a wildebeest and one impala, which
contracted anthrax, have died, according to Ul Azam. There have also
been cases of foot and mouth disease (FMD) and many animals are
suffering from acute arthritis, he said.

In the zoo's medical wing, an elderly Indian lion has ongoing health
problems while a Nepalese rhino called Kanchi, with protruding ribs
and mottled skin, is also in bad shape. Both are expected to die
within months. "She has an infection in her uterus," Ul Azam said of
the rhino. "She's 19-plus, and may live 3 to 5 months. We are not
sure. Rhinos are critically endangered animals so once she goes we
can't get another one."

Despite the bad publicity, the acting chief of the zoo, Bibekananda
Chowdhury says the facility remains one of the top attractions in the
city, home to 12 million people. "It's one of the most important sites
to visit in Dhaka. We have at least 8000 people visit every day," he
said. "The cost is only 10 taka (14 US cents) which means even poor
people can come here. Even without some of the animals, we are still
the number one attraction in the city."

[I am speechless. In a word this situation in Dhaka is a disgrace. The
Bangladeshi government should have spent the money on upgrading the
zoo and expert advice and help. If any of our members have contacts by
whom this situation might be corrected, do inform them of this
Bangladesh situation as soon as possible.

The anthrax cases are a bit of a puzzle. Anthrax in zoo animals
usually occurs when carnivores are fed carelessly purchased local
meat; i.e., from animals dead from anthrax. But these were grazers and
browsers which would thus suggest that the zoo bought contaminated
forage from a local farm or farms, and some with active FMD.
