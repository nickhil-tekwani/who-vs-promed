[While I am not 100% sure, it appears as though this past week has been record-breaking in terms of the highest number of polio cases (due to WPV and cVDPV infections) reported in a week in the past several years: 21 total cases with 19 due to cVDPV infection and 2 due to WPV1 infection. But that being said, reading further down this update for sections [2] and [3], today (15 Nov 2019) Pakistan confirmed an additional 6 cases: 4 due to WPV1 infection and 2 due to cVDPV2. For those interested in this topic, I highly recommend reading all of the sections of this post to get a fuller understanding of the challenges as well as probable cause and effect of the situation related to both WPV1 and cVDPV2 circulation currently ongoing.

For a map showing the locations of both WPV-associated cases and cVDPV-associated cases, see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12 months below. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 23 countries: 15 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 3 in the Western Pacific, with either WPV or cVDPV isolates (or both in the case of Pakistan) in their countries. An important reminder is that positive environmental samples means that the virus is circulating in the area where the samples have been obtained. Hence, if a susceptible individual is infected with the virus, there is a chance the person may develop paralytic disease.

[2] Pakistan: 3 new cases KP - media report
Date: Fri 15 Nov 2019
Source: Urdu Point [edited]
https://www.urdupoint.com/en/health/three-new-cases-of-polio-reported-in-kp-toll-762604.html


The numbers of polio cases [in KP] have reached 64 during the current year [2019] after 3 new cases were registered in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the emergency operation centre said on Friday [15 Nov 2019].

The new cases were confirmed in 3 children from union council Bakhmal Ahmadzai, Lakki Marwat district, Mashmansoor and Darratang areas. Samples from these children had been sent to National Institute of Health Islamabad where the detailed laboratory tests confirmed existence of poliovirus in samples. After confirmation, the number of polio cases in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has reached 64 while countrywide this number was 86.

After emergence of new cases in the province, a high-level meeting was held under the headship of coordinator, emergency operation centre, Abdul Basit, wherein he said vaccination of anti-polio drops to every child was imperative to eliminate the curse of polio from society. He urged parents to surely immunize their children against polio during upcoming campaigns that would start in all districts of Hazara and Shangla district from [18 Nov 2019].

Effective anti-polio drives and ensuring vaccination to every child was imperative for extermination of polio virus, he said, adding that no negligence would be tolerated in this regard. He made it clear that anti-polio vaccine was totally safe for children from all aspects.

[3] Pakistan: 4 new WPV1 cases, 2 new cVDPV2 cases - media report
Date: Fri 15 Nov 2019
Source: Samaa.tv [edited]
https://www.samaa.tv/living/health/2019/11/six-polio-cases-reported-in-kp-sindh-tally-hits-94/


Six new cases of polio have been reported, taking the tally to 95 across Pakistan. The cases have been confirmed by the Sindh and KP emergency operation centres and the national coordinator for polio eradication, Dr Rana Safdar.

Of the total number of cases reported so far, 9 are of VDPV2.

Two of the 6 new cases are of polio contracted from a mutated version of the virus in the environment. It is called vaccine-derived virus type 2 or VDPV2. They were reported from Charsadda and Torghar [both in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province].

Three of the remaining cases are from Lakki Marwat [also in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa], while one is from Karachi [Sindh province]. Details of the cases were confirmed by the RRL lab.

In Lakki Marwat, the victims include a 32-month-old boy from Bakhmal Ahmadzai, a 2-month-old boy from Mashamanso, and another 2-month-old boy from Daratang. In Karachi, the victim belongs to Jamshed Town and is a 2-year-old boy.

The 2 cases of vaccine-derived polio were detected from 2 boys. One of them is 3.5 years old, while the other is 13 months old.

All cases are being investigated, according to the lab report.

The discovery of 7 fresh polio cases in Pakistan recently prompted the government to plan vaccinations from [18 Nov 2019]. These new cases became controversial after the Guardian published a story alledging they were covered up and that the children had caught a type of polio that had been globally finished off.

SAMAA Digital spoke to the chief epidemiologist, who has been brought back to run the government's vaccination campaigns. We asked Dr Safdar about the [7 Nov 2019] Guardian story and whether he agreed with its characterisation of the situation.

There are 3 types of wild poliovirus: 1, 2, and 3. [Types 2 and 3] have been globally eliminated, according to the WHO. But the Guardian reported that 2 had returned. Dr Safdar refuted this. He said that the children did not contract the eliminated old type 2. More accurately, theirs were cases of polio contracted from a mutated version of the [vaccine] virus in the environment. They got what is called vaccine-derived polio.

Explainer
This is considerably confusing, so we thought we would break down the basics.

If you have a virus you need to vaccinate people against it. The [vaccine used] itself is made from a weak strain of the virus. You give the vaccine to children and so their body develops the immunity to it. When we vaccinate children in Pakistan against polio, we give them the oral polio vaccine (OPV) drops. This is a live, but weak or attenuated, form of the virus. In reaction, the children develop antibodies that protect them against active infection.

However, sometimes because the OPV is live, a child will get the drops, become immunised (and safe) but excrete a weak strain of the virus from the OPV and introduce it to the environment. This is what they call vaccine-derived poliovirus or VDPV. This kind of thing happens rarely. But just to be safe, governments keep frequently vaccinating children. However, if you leave too long a gap between campaigns, there is a risk of this happening.

In these recent 7 cases, Dr Safdar says the children have VDPV. More specifically, VDPV is a mutated form of the Sabin strain of poliovirus that spreads in under-immunised areas after the vaccine virus is excreted and ends up in the environment, according to the WHO.

For cases of paralysis to occur, the mutated virus needs to have been circulating in vulnerable populations for at least 12 months. This is why the WHO and Global Polio Eradication Initiative say that gaps in immunisation campaigns are the main reason why VDPV spreads.

[4] Pakistan: theories on cVDPV development - media report
Date: Wed 13 Nov 2019
Source: Samaa TV [abridged, edited]
https://www.samaa.tv/news/2019/11/pakistans-seven-new-polio-cases-explained/


[I believe this was an earlier version of the above article as the entire initial section is almost identical to the media report in [3] above, and the URL link is no longer available. That being said, there was more information on the planned strategy to deal with the cVDPV2 outbreak I've included below. - Mod.MPP]

In these recent 7 cases, Dr Safdar says the children have VDPV. More specifically, VDPV is a mutated form of the Sabin strain of polio virus that spreads in under-immunised areas after the vaccine virus is excreted and ends up in the environment, according to the WHO.

For cases of paralysis to occur, the mutated virus needs to have been circulating in vulnerable populations for at least 12 months. This is why the WHO and Global Polio Eradication Initiative say that gaps in immunisation campaigns are the main reason why VDPV spreads.

What the government is doing
The new immunisation campaign will be carried out in 11 KP districts, including Abbottabad, Mansehra, Torghar, Kohistan, and Shangla. It will target around 2.4 million children against the recently emerged strain.

A similar campaign started Monday 11 Nov 2019] in Rawalpindi and Diamer and other districts of Gilgit Baltistan.

"We are administering a special vaccine for poliovirus type 2 for the children living in those areas," Dr Rana Safdar said.

When the government detected the 7 cases, it developed a 2-pronged strategy. The 1st line of action was to mitigate risks and protect vulnerable children. "In the outbreak areas, around 180 000 children were vaccinated with inactivated polio vaccine [IPV]," said Dr Safdar. The IPV is the injectable form of the vaccine, which provides immunity against all 3 types of poliovirus.

The Global Polio Eradication Initiative says IPV is highly effective in preventing paralytic disease caused by all 3 types of poliovirus; however, it does not stop the transmission of the poliovirus in a community. This is why OPV, the oral polio vaccine we use, is the vaccine of choice.

The government's next step was to investigate if any old strain of the polio vaccine was used during any of the campaigns.

In April 2016, there was a global switch from the trivalent to bivalent OPV. The component that acted against type 2 wild poliovirus was withdrawn. All old vaccines were supposed to be discarded.

"A very extensive search was carried out to see if the old vaccine was used," said Dr Safdar. "Every facility was examined individually, but there was no indication of the switched vaccine being used."

The virus isolates were then sent for genetic sequencing. Last week, it was confirmed they were of vaccine-derived polio virus type 2 (VDPV2), Dr Safdar said.

There are around 20 countries in the world where there have been VDPV outbreaks. Even now, the outbreak is ongoing in more than a dozen countries: Nigeria, Kenya, surrounding countries in Africa, and Philippines and China in Asia. These have mostly been the result of children's immunity to the virus strain going down after the global switch.

This year [2019], Pakistan has recorded 82 [now 86] cases of polio. However, these have all been WPV1, Dr Safdar emphasised, adding that we have eradicated type 2 and 3.

The last case of type 2 was seen [worldwide] in 1999, and the last case due to infection by type 3 was reported in 2012.

The unanswered questions
It is not clear if a gap in immunisation is the sole reason for these 7 new cases. Dr Safdar said that they were investigating if the virus was brought into Pakistan by travellers from areas where there is an active outbreak. What this theory would not explain, however, is why the children would have contracted it had they been immune.

Progress Toward Poliomyelitis Eradication - Pakistan, January 2018-September 2019
-----------------------------
Hsu CH, Kader M, Mahamud A, et al.: Progress Toward Poliomyelitis Eradication - Pakistan, January 2018-September 2019. Morb Mortal Wkly Rep (MMWR). 2019; 68(45): 1029-1033. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6845a5.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Since 2016, Afghanistan and Pakistan have been the only countries reporting ongoing transmission of indigenous wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1).

What is added by this report?
During January 2018-September 2019, the number of WPV1 cases in Pakistan increased, compared with the number during the previous 4 years. Sewage samples indicated wide WPV1 transmission, not only in the 3 major reservoir areas in 3 provinces, but also among other districts and provinces. Vaccine refusals, chronically missed children, community campaign fatigue, and poor vaccination management and implementation have exacerbated the situation.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Stopping WPV1 transmission will require continuing cross-border coordination with Afghanistan, gaining community trust, conducting high-quality campaigns, improving oversight of field activities, and improving managerial processes to unify eradication efforts.

Afghanistan and Pakistan are the only countries that continue to confirm ongoing wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) transmission (1). During January 2018-September 2019, the number of WPV1 cases in Pakistan increased, compared with the number during the previous 4 years. This report updates previous reports on Pakistan's polio eradication activities, progress, and challenges (2,3). In 2018, Pakistan reported 12 WPV1 cases, a 50% increase from 8 cases in 2017, and a 31% increase in the proportion of WPV1-positive sites under environmental surveillance (i.e., sampling of sewage to detect poliovirus). As of [7 Nov 2019], 80 WPV1 cases had been reported, compared with 8 cases by the same time in 2018. An intensive schedule of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs)* implemented by community health workers in the core reservoirs (i.e., Karachi, Peshawar, and Quetta) where WPV1 circulation has never been interrupted, and by mobile teams, has failed to interrupt WPV1 transmission in core reservoirs and prevent WPV1 resurgence in nonreservoir areas. Sewage samples have indicated wide WPV1 transmission in nonreservoir areas in other districts and provinces. Vaccine refusals, chronically missed children, community campaign fatigue, and poor vaccination management and implementation have exacerbated the situation. To overcome challenges to vaccinating children who are chronically missed in SIAs and to attain country and global polio eradication goals, substantial changes are needed in Pakistan's polio eradication program, including continuing cross-border coordination with Afghanistan, gaining community trust, conducting high-quality vaccination campaigns, improving oversight of field activities, and improving managerial processes to unify eradication efforts.

Immunization activities
Routine immunization: The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund estimated national coverage with 3 doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) received through the routine immunization program by age one year in Pakistan to be 75% each year during 2016-2018 (4). Reported 3-dose (OPV3) administrative coverage (calculated by dividing the number of doses administered by the estimated target population) is highly variable among provinces; the highest reported administrative coverage rates in 2018 were in Azad Jammu and Kashmir province (95%) and Islamabad Capital Territory (91%); the lowest were in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (68%) and Balochistan (35%) provinces. Variation in coverage among districts is similarly high.

History of doses of OPV received (according to vaccination cards and parental recall) by children aged 6-23 months with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) who tested negative for poliovirus (nonpolio AFP [NPAFP]**) is a surrogate estimate of OPV coverage in the population, with particular focus on the proportion of children who have never received OPV during SIAs or through routine immunization services (zero-dose children). Provinces and areas with the highest proportion of zero-dose children in 2018 were Gilgit-Baltistan (2.7%), Islamabad (1.2%), and Balochistan (0.9%).

Supplementary immunization activities: During January 2018-September 2019, 7 national SIAs and 9 subnational SIAs were conducted using bivalent OPV (bOPV), which contains polio vaccine virus types 1 and 3. Small-scale SIAs were implemented in response to isolation of WPV1 from environmental surveillance or from persons with AFP using bOPV and monovalent (type 1) OPV. SIA quality was assessed in subdistricts (union councils) by intracampaign monitoring surveys and lot quality assurance sample surveys***. Both methods have indicated a decline in SIA quality during 2018-2019, compared with those in previous years, with substantial numbers of children missed in union councils (up to 20% missed in Punjab and up to 17% missed in Sindh). SIA rounds using a single dose of injectable inactivated poliovirus vaccine were implemented serially in high-risk districts of Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sindh.

Community-based vaccination and permanent transit points: Locally recruited community health workers in districts of core reservoirs (i.e., areas where WPV1 circulation has never been interrupted) are responsible for increasing vaccine coverage within their communities during and between SIAs through engagement with local leaders and community members. As of August 2019, a total of 19 274 community health workers had been deployed in 15 districts in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sindh; 85% are women who, because of cultural and religious customs, can more easily enter homes in these areas. To identify and vaccinate children in mobile populations at high risk, 1106 permanent transit posts (i.e., small vaccination clinics) were placed at the official border crossings with Afghanistan, along major domestic migration routes, and at railroad and bus transport hubs in all provinces.

Surveillance activities
AFP surveillance: In 2018, all provinces exceeded the target NPAFP rate of 2 per 100 000 population aged less than 15 years (sufficiently sensitive surveillance to detect a case of polio) and the 80% target proportion of AFP cases with collection of adequate stool specimens**** (Table: Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance indicators and number of reported cases of wild poliovirus (WPV) and number and proportion of WPV-positive environmental surveillance samples, by region and period - Pakistan, January 2018-September 2019). During January 2018-September 2019, the national NPAFP rate was 15.9 per 100 000, ranging from 14.6 to 27.7 among provinces; the percentage of AFP cases with adequate stool specimens was 89% nationally, ranging from 86% to 92% among provinces.

Environmental surveillance: Environmental surveillance supplements AFP surveillance through systematic sewage sampling (currently at 60 sites) and testing for poliovirus. During January 2018-September 2019, in addition to core reservoirs, poliovirus was detected continually from multiple nonreservoir sites, particularly those in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Bannu and South Waziristan), Punjab (Islamabad, Lahore, and Rawalpindi), and Sindh (Hyderabad and Sukkur) (Table). Among the same 51 sites sampled during January 2018-September 2019, 70 of 457 specimens (15%) were WPV1-positive in 2017, 74 of 459 (16%) in 2018, and 209 of 468 (45%) in 2019. Approximately 45% of all environmental sites tested positive in 2019, compared with 15% during the same period in 2018 and 16% in 2017.

Epidemiology of WPV1 cases
Twelve WPV1 cases were reported in Pakistan during 2018, a 50% increase from 8 in 2017 (Figure 1. Cases of wild poliovirus type 1 by month - Pakistan, January 2015-September 2019. The figure is a histogram, an epidemiologic curve showing the number of cases of wild poliovirus type 1 reported in Pakistan, by month, during January 2015-September 2019.). 72 WPV1 cases have been reported during January-September 2019 among 22 districts in 4 provinces, compared with 4 during the same period in 2018 among 4 districts in 2 provinces. Of the 84 WPV1 cases with onset during January 2018-September 2019, 61 (73%) were from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 9 (11%) from Balochistan, 9 (11%) from Sindh, and 5 (6%) from Punjab (see Table) (Figure 2. Location of reported wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases, by province and period - Pakistan, January 2018-September 2019. The figure is a series of 3 maps showing the location of reported cases of wild poliovirus type 1, by province and period, in Pakistan during January 2018-June 2018, July 2018-December 2018, and January-September 2019.). Among these 84 cases, ages of patients ranged from 2-144 months (median = 18 months). According to parental recall, 9 (11%) patients had received zero OPV doses, 12 (14%) had received 1-3 doses, and 59 (70%) had received greater than or equal to 4 doses. Four (5%) patients had unknown vaccination histories or are still being investigated. Among those who received greater than or equal to one dose, 2 (2%) received only routine immunization and 49 (58%) only SIA doses.

Several viral genetic lineages persisted through the 2018-2019 low season (November-April) and, concomitant with the increase in the number of detected WPV1 cases, markedly expanded during 2019, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Among the 5 genetically distinct clusters (i.e., groups of polioviruses sharing greater than or equal to 95% sequence identity in the viral capsid protein VP1) associated with AFP cases, during the reporting period, 4 were detected in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Discussion
Observations based on the geography of WPV1-positive environmental surveillance sites and viral genomic sequence diversity indicate that the Pakistan polio eradication program made substantial progress during 2015-2016 but, despite slight decreases in case numbers, progress stalled during 2017-2018 (2). The number of cases in 2019 to date has increased approximately 15-fold from the same period in 2018, and the geographic distribution of WPV1-positive environmental surveillance specimens has expanded beyond the core reservoirs. The proportion of positive environmental surveillance specimens began to increase in mid-2017, heralding the subsequent increase in the number of paralytic cases in late 2018. The current status of polio eradication in Pakistan has serious global implications: the increased risk for WPV1 spreading beyond Pakistan's borders is high; if transmission in Pakistan is not quickly controlled and back on track toward interruption, success of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative is threatened.

The Pakistan program's failure in progress toward polio eradication is related to both community and program management challenges. Community challenges are increasingly strident refusals to vaccinate and children chronically missed by immunization activities. Because national and subnational SIAs have been occurring every 4-6 weeks, and there are frequent response campaigns after identification of polio cases and WPV1-positive environmental samples as well, campaign-fatigued communities are complaining that the government is not addressing other public health needs (e.g., nutrition and clean water) or other public services (5). The spread of false information, particularly through social media (e.g., that OPV contains pork products or causes sterility) has increased community resistance to vaccination (6). It is essential that the program counters false information, informs communities of the importance of vaccination, and engages and listens to communities to reestablish trust in the vaccination program. While starting to address these issues, the program has suspended SIAs in core reservoirs until December 2019. The Technical Advisory Group, an expert polio group comprising internal and external partners from a variety of backgrounds (e.g., virology, vaccines and vaccine delivery, epidemiology, and public health policy) that provides critical feedback on the polio program, recommended in August 2019 that SIAs subsequently be spaced greater than or equal to 2 months apart to assist in community engagement (7). In addition, mobile populations are difficult to identify, track, and target for vaccination; however, the Pakistan program has enhanced internal efforts and is coordinating polio eradication activities with the Afghanistan program (i.e., vaccinations at border crossing, data sharing, and coordination of SIAs).

The Pakistan polio eradication program has grown complex in its management and operational organization. Management review in 3 districts of Karachi revealed overlapping terms of reference, delayed availability of information, systematic gaps in managerial oversight of decisions and activities, and an overall failure in staff members' accountability when implementing SIAs (McKinsey and Company, unpublished report, 2019). The review concluded that meeting programmatic challenges might require managerial restructuring so that decision-making, oversight, and implementation occur as "One Team." At the union council level, identifying the causes of operational failures in planning and supervision could enable the program to vaccinate those children who chronically have been missed. Local restructuring could improve oversight in such underperforming union councils, which has been considered an impediment to stopping WPV1 circulation in Karachi, Peshawar, and Quetta. Restructuring at national and provincial emergency operation centers and streamlining data flow could improve timely and effective decision-making.

The Pakistan polio eradication program has undertaken a series of management, communication, community engagement, and epidemiologic reviews that have identified essential gaps needing to be addressed. The national leadership has committed to implementing transformative changes, and maintaining this sense of urgency is essential. Managerial and operational weaknesses and gaps have been acknowledged, and the means to rectify them have been identified. Although responding to community concerns to minimize OPV refusal will take time, enhanced efforts (e.g., continual engagements with communities, countering false information, greater accountability, and more effective oversight) have already begun. The goal of interrupting WPV1 transmission in Pakistan is achievable but will require full and rapid implementation of Technical Advisory Group recommendations to improve program management and operational effectiveness.


* Mass campaigns conducted for a brief period (days to weeks) in which one dose of oral poliovirus vaccine is administered to all children aged less than 5 years, regardless of vaccination history. Campaigns can be conducted nationally or subnationally (i.e., in portions of the country).

** Vaccination histories of children aged 6-23 months with acute flaccid paralysis who do not test positive for WPV are used to estimate OPV coverage of the overall target population and to corroborate national reported routine vaccination coverage estimates.

*** Lot quality assurance sampling is a rapid method used to assess the quality of vaccination activities after SIAs in predefined areas such as health districts (referred to as "lots"), using a small sample size. Lot quality assurance sampling involves dividing the population into lots and ascertaining receipt of vaccination by randomly selected persons within each lot. If the number of unvaccinated persons in the sample exceeds a predetermined value, then the lot is classified as having an unsatisfactory level of vaccination coverage, and mop-up activities are recommended.

**** AFP surveillance quality is monitored by performance indicators that include 1) the detection rate of NPAFP cases and 2) the percentage of AFP cases with adequate stool specimens. WHO operational targets for countries with endemic poliovirus transmission are NPAFP detection rates of greater than or equal to 2 cases per 100 000 population aged less than 15 years and adequate stool specimen collected from greater than or equal to 80% of AFP cases. Adequate stool specimens are defined as 2 stool specimens of sufficient quality for laboratory analysis, collected greater than or equal to 24 hours apart, both within 14 days of paralysis onset, and arriving in good condition at a World Health Organization-accredited laboratory with reverse cold chain maintained, without leakage or desiccation, and with proper documentation.

[The big question is whether or not the current trend for vaccination refusal will be overcome or if Pakistan (and neighboring Afghanistan) will continue to have uninterrupted circulation of the wild poliovirus and perhaps also of cVDPV2 now that the vaccine OPV2 is being re-introduced to interrupt transmission of the cVDPV2. A conundrum that has global implications. I still feel there is a strong role for medical anthropologists to assist in this conundrum. - Mod.MPP]

Update on Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus Outbreaks - Worldwide, January 2018-June 2019
--------------------------
Jorba J, Diop OM, Iber J, et al.: Update on Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus Outbreaks -- Worldwide, January 2018-June 2019. Morb Mortal Wkly Rep (MMWR). 2019; 68(45): 1024-1028. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6845a4.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) can emerge in settings with low population immunity and cause paralysis.

What is added by this report?
Following the synchronized switch from trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV, types 1, 2, and 3) to bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV, types 1 and 3 only) in 2016, transmission of type 2 cVDPVs was detected in 12 countries in Africa and also in China. Type 1 cVDPVs were identified in Indonesia, Myanmar, and Papua New Guinea, and type 3 cVDPVs were identified in Somalia.

What are the implications for public health practice?
All countries must maintain high population immunity. Cessation of all OPV use after certification of polio eradication will eliminate the risk for VDPV emergence.

[All figures, table, and references can be found at the source URL above.]

Certification of global eradication of indigenous wild poliovirus type 2 occurred in 2015 and of type 3 in 2019. Since the launch of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) in 1988 and broad use of live, attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), the number of wild poliovirus cases has declined greater than 99.99% (1). Genetically divergent vaccine-derived poliovirus* (VDPV) strains can emerge during vaccine use and spread in underimmunized populations, becoming circulating VDPV (cVDPV) strains, and resulting in outbreaks of paralytic poliomyelitis**. In April 2016, all oral polio vaccination switched from trivalent OPV (tOPV; containing vaccine virus types 1, 2, and 3) to bivalent OPV (bOPV; containing types 1 and 3) (2). Monovalent type 2 OPV (mOPV2) is used in response campaigns to control type 2 cVDPV (cVDPV2) outbreaks. This report presents data on cVDPV outbreaks detected during January 2018-June 2019 (as of [30 Sep 2019]). Compared with January 2017-June 2018 (3), the number of reported cVDPV outbreaks more than tripled, from 9 to 29; 25 (86%) of the outbreaks were caused by cVDPV2. The increase in the number of outbreaks in 2019 resulted from VDPV2 both inside and outside of mOPV2-response areas. GPEI is planning future use of a novel type 2 OPV, stabilized to decrease the likelihood of reversion to neurovirulence. However, all countries must maintain high population immunity to decrease the risk for cVDPV emergence. Cessation of all OPV use after certification of polio eradication will eliminate the risk for VDPV emergence.

Detection of cVDPV1
During January 2018-June 2019, cVDPV type 1 (cVDPV1) circulation was detected in 3 countries (Indonesia, Myanmar, and Papua New Guinea), compared with 1 country (Papua New Guinea) during the previous reporting period (3). cVDPV1 isolates from acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases and environmental surveillance (testing of sewage samples for poliovirus) continued to be detected from the previously reported Papua New Guinea outbreak (4) (Table: Number of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) isolates detected, by serotype, source, and other selected characteristics - worldwide, January 2018-June 2019); the AFP patient with the latest case had paralysis onset in October 2018. A new cVDPV1 outbreak was reported in Myanmar; the 1st patient had paralysis onset in May 2019, and the most recent case occurred in August 2019. A new cVDPV1 outbreak of one case was reported in Indonesia with paralysis onset in November 2018.

Detection of cVDPV2
During January 2018-June 2019, 25 cVDPV2 outbreaks were reported in 13 countries (Table); 12 of the 13 countries were in Africa (Figure 1. Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) outbreaks* - worldwide, January 2018-June 2019. The figure is a map of the world indicating the location of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks during January 2018-June 2019.), and one outbreak occurred in China. During the reporting period, 124 (77%) of the 161 cVDPV cases were cVDPV2, a profile continuing the trend of type 2 dominance that has been observed for the past decade (Figure 2. Number of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) cases detected, by serotype -- worldwide, 2000-2019*. The figure is a histogram showing the number of vaccine-derived poliovirus cases detected each year worldwide during 2000-2019.).

Western Africa. A single cVDPV2 emergence (designated JIS-1***) 1st detected by environmental surveillance in Jigawa state (Nigeria) in January 2018 was later detected in 12 other states in Nigeria and internationally throughout the reporting period. During the 1st half of 2019, isolates genetically linked to JIS-1 were detected from AFP cases and environmental surveillance samples initially in Niger, and subsequently in Benin, Cameroon, and Ghana (5). Five other independent cVDPV2 emergences were detected in Nigeria: 2 in Kogi state (KGS-1 and KGS-2) and 3 in Sokoto (SOS-3, SOS-4, and SOS-5) and Niger (SOS-3) states. During the reporting period, multiple mOPV2 outbreak response activities were conducted in Nigeria (5) and in neighboring countries where JIS-1 cVDPV2 was detected.

Central Africa. During the reporting period, 9 cVDPV2 emergences were detected among 42 AFP cases in 5 provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC); 6 of these emergences were detected during the 1st half of 2019. The previously reported cVDPV2 emergences 1st detected in Haut Lomami (HLO-1) and Mongala (MON-1) provinces (6) and a new 2018 emergence in Haut Katanga (HKA-1) were apparently interrupted (as of [30 Sep 2019], it has been 11-15 months since the latest detection). During January-June 2019, 3 additional independent cVDPV2 emergences were detected in Kasai (KAS-1-KAS-3) province, and 3 new cVDPV2 emergences were detected in Haut Lomami (HLO-2), Tshuapa (TPA-1), and Sankuru (SAN-1) provinces.

During the reporting period, 4 new cVDPV2 emergences were detected in southern districts of Central African Republic (CAR); 2 were 1st reported in Bimbo district (BIM-1 and BIM-2) and 2 were 1st reported in Bambari district (BAM-1 and BAM-2). As of [30 Sep 2019], 6 AFP cases were associated with these 4 cVDPV2 emergences; the 1st patient had paralysis onset in May 2019. Estimated OPV coverage in CAR both before and after the tOPV-to-bOPV switch has been chronically low (less than 50%).

Three new cVDPV2 emergences were detected in Angola; 2 were 1st detected in Lunda Norte province (LNO-1 and LNO-2), and one was 1st detected in Huila (HUI-1) province. The 1st cVDPV2 isolate was detected in Lunda Norte from a patient with AFP who had paralysis onset in April 2019. cVDPV2 isolates genetically related to these Angola emergences were later detected from AFP cases in Lunda Sul and Huambo provinces.

Horn of Africa. During January 2018-June 2019, cVDPV2 genetically related to the emergence 1st detected in Somalia in October 2017 (BAN-1) (6) was isolated from 10 patients with AFP in Somalia and 1 in Ethiopia, and from 26 environmental surveillance samples (24 collected in Mogadishu, Somalia, and 2 in Nairobi, Kenya). BAN-1 cases were detected in provinces in South-Central and Puntland zones of Somalia (Banadeer, Bari, Gedo, Hiran, Lower Juba, Sool, and Togdheer) and in the Somali region of Ethiopia.

Southern Africa. During October-December 2018, cVDPV2 was isolated from one AFP patient and 2 contacts in the Molumbo district of Zambezia province (Mozambique).

China. cVDPV2 was isolated from one environmental surveillance sample collected in Xinjiang province in April 2018 and from one AFP patient and 2 patient contacts in Sichuan province during May-June 2019. The cVDPV2 sequences from this emergence were 1.4%-3.7% divergent from parental Sabin 2, indicating prolonged circulation.

Detection of cVDPV3
During 2018, cVDPV3 was isolated from 7 patients with AFP (one was coinfected with cVDPV2) and 12 environmental surveillance samples collected in 4 provinces of Somalia (BAN-2) (Table). The latest patient with AFP had onset of paralysis on [7 Sep 2018] (6).

Discussion
The number of cVDPV outbreaks detected worldwide increased from 9 in 6 countries during the January 2017-June 2018 reporting period (3) to 29 in 15 countries during January 2018-June 2019; 25 (86%) outbreaks were cVDPV2 emergences, 18 (72%) of which were detected during the 1st half of 2019 in Central and Western Africa. cVDPV2 cases primarily occurred in type 2-naive children who were born after the switch from tOPV to bOPV and who were therefore at high risk because they were born in areas with chronically low routine and supplementary polio immunization coverage. Seven new cVDPV2 outbreaks were detected in Angola and CAR, countries with no mOPV2 use after the withdrawal of type 2 OPV, but which border DRC, where mOPV2 was used in outbreak responses. Similarly, new cVDPV emergences have occurred in areas of countries that were not part of the mOPV2 response areas (Angola, DRC, and Nigeria). This reflects the increasing susceptibility to type 2 infection and cVDPV2 outbreaks because more than 3 years have passed since OPV2 cessation. International cVDPV2 spread of JIS-1 from Nigeria to Benin, Cameroon, Ghana, and Niger, and of BAN-1 from Somalia to Ethiopia suggests that multiple mOPV2 responses after detection in each of the countries were of insufficient quality, delayed, or too limited in scope to prevent further spread that, in some cases, led to international transmission.

cVDPV1 and cVDPV3 outbreaks can emerge in countries with suboptimal routine and supplementary immunization coverage; at the subnational level, areas with very wide gaps in immunity carry a higher risk for VDPV emergence and circulation. bOPV campaigns in response to cVDPV1 and cVDPV3 emergences effectively controlled outbreaks in Papua New Guinea (cVDPV1) and Somalia (cVDPV3). cVDPV2 outbreak control requires the use of mOPV2, the release of which depends on the decision of the director-general of the World Health Organization with the advice from the mOPV2 Advisory Group. Early cVDPV2 detection and timeliness of response are key in addressing circulating VDPV2s; a geographically limited scale mOPV2 campaign should be conducted within 14 days after laboratory cVDPV2 confirmation before larger scale rounds are implemented.

Since April 2016, approximately 300 million mOPV2 doses have been administered in response to cVDPV2 outbreaks (7). Although the effective means to stop cVDPV2 outbreaks is mOPV2, the risks associated with its use include seeding of new VDPV2 emergences with the potential for further circulation. The increase in the frequency of new emergences of cVDPV2 outbreaks outside of mOPV2 response areas has led to enhanced surveillance activities and scaling the geographic distribution of mOPV2 campaigns to 1-4 million persons aged less than 5 years. GPEI partners are providing a surge in technical assistance staffing to outbreak countries to improve the timeliness and quality of mOPV2 responses to aid in more rapid control of outbreaks and limit new emergences. A novel OPV type 2 vaccine, stabilized to decrease the likelihood of reversion to neurovirulence during replication, is in clinical trials (8) and, if found to be safe and effective, could be available in limited supply for emergency use as early as mid-2020, and in larger supply at a later date. Expansion of environmental surveillance provides critical indicators for early VDPV detection (9); for example, environmental surveillance detection in Cameroon and Ghana in 2019 confirmed circulation of the cVDPV2 emergence of JIS-1 outside Nigeria in the absence of detection of AFP (Cameroon) or before detection (Ghana) of AFP cases.

Since 2000, 1085 cases of paralysis caused by cVDPV have been reported, 932 (86%) of which were type 2. During the same period, approximately 12 million cases of paralytic polio have been averted through polio eradication efforts. Vaccine-associated paralytic polio can occur in children who receive the vaccine, usually after the 1st dose, or in their susceptible close contacts, totaling about 2-4 cases per birth cohort of 1 million children before the switch from tOPV to bOPV. Since the switch, an estimated 160-240 cases per year of type 2 vaccine-associated paralytic polio have been averted. In addition, there have been no new cases of VDPV2 excretion identified in persons with primary immunodeficiency (iVDPV) since the switch from tOPV-to-bOPV. Cessation of all OPV use after certification of polio eradication will eliminate the risk for VDPV emergence and spread.

* Vaccine-derived poliovirus strains are greater than 1% divergent (for poliovirus types 1 and 3) or greater than 0.6% divergent (for poliovirus type 2) in VP1 sequences from the corresponding OPV strain.

[I am intrigued by the confidence in the novel OPV2 vaccine currently under study. Most of my intrigue surrounds how many passages the vaccine made in mice before concluding that the virus was more stable to avoid neurovirulence reversion following passage in people. As a reminder, OPV was tested and introduced in the early 1960s, but neurovirulence reversion of the vaccine virus was 1st identified as having occurred in Egypt during the period 1983-1993 through retrospective laboratory testing of environmental samples (Yang CF, et al.: Circulation of endemic type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus in Egypt from 1983 to 1993. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8366-8377. DOI: 10.1128/JVI.77.15.8366-8377.2003. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC165252/), and later found responsible for the 1st identified outbreak due to a cVDPV on Hispanola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic) in 2000-2001 (Kew O, Morris-Glasgow V, Landaverde M, Burns C, Shaw J, et al.: Outbreak of poliomyelitis in Hispaniola associated with circulating type 1 vaccine-derived poliovirus. Science. 2002; 296 (5566): 356-359. DOI: 10.1126/science.1068284. https://science.sciencemag.org/content/296/5566/356.long). Hence, there were 30-plus years of experience with OPV until this was recognized through advances in genomics of viruses.

I'm also intrigued that the safety of the vaccine has had limited testing in individuals who had received IPV (inactivated poliovirus vaccine) prior to recent of the novel OPV.

Further testing and time will tell.

"Use of oral live-attenuated polio vaccines (OPV), and injected inactivated polio vaccines (IPV) has almost achieved global eradication of wild polioviruses. To address the goals of achieving and maintaining global eradication and minimising the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-derived polioviruses, we tested novel monovalent oral type-2 poliovirus (OPV2) vaccine candidates that are genetically more stable than existing OPVs, with a lower risk of reversion to neurovirulence. Our study represents the 1st in-human testing of these 2 novel OPV2 candidates. We aimed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines, the presence and extent of faecal shedding, and the neurovirulence of shed virus.

Methods
"In this double-blind, single-centre phase 1 trial, we isolated participants in a purpose-built containment facility at the University of Antwerp Hospital (Antwerp, Belgium), to minimise the risk of environmental release of the novel OPV2 candidates. Participants, who were recruited by local advertising, were adults (aged 18-50 years) in good health who had previously been vaccinated with IPV, and who would not have any contact with immunosuppressed or unvaccinated people for the duration of faecal shedding at the end of the study. The 1st participant randomly chose an envelope containing the name of a vaccine candidate, and this determined their allocation; the next 14 participants to be enrolled in the study were sequentially allocated to this group and received the same vaccine. The subsequent 15 participants enrolled after this group were allocated to receive the other vaccine. Participants and the study staff were masked to vaccine groups until the end of the study period. Participants each received a single dose of one vaccine candidate (candidate 1, S2/cre5/S15domV/rec1/hifi3; or candidate 2, S2/S15domV/CpG40), and they were monitored for adverse events, immune responses, and faecal shedding of the vaccine virus for 28 days. Shed virus isolates were tested for the genetic stability of attenuation. The primary outcomes were the incidence and type of serious and severe adverse events, the proportion of participants showing viral shedding in their stools, the time to cessation of viral shedding, the cell culture infective dose of shed virus in virus-positive stools, and a combined index of the prevalence, duration, and quantity of viral shedding in all participants. This study is registered with EudraCT, number 2017-000908-21 and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03430349.

"Findings
"Between 22 May and 22 Aug 2017, 48 volunteers were screened, of whom 15 (31%) volunteers were excluded for reasons relating to the inclusion or exclusion criteria, 3 (6%) were not treated because of restrictions to the number of participants in each group, and 30 (63%) were sequentially allocated to groups (15 participants per group). Both novel OPV2 candidates were immunogenic and increased the median blood titre of serum neutralising antibodies; all participants were seroprotected after vaccination. Both candidates had acceptable tolerability, and no serious adverse events occurred during the study. However, severe events were reported in 6 (40%) participants receiving candidate 1 (8 events) and 9 (60%) participants receiving candidate 2 (12 events); most of these events were increased blood creatinine phosphokinase but were not accompanied by clinical signs or symptoms. Vaccine virus was detected in the stools of 15 (100%) participants receiving vaccine candidate 1 and 13 (87%) participants receiving vaccine candidate 2. Vaccine poliovirus shedding stopped at a median of 23 days (IQR 15-36) after candidate 1 administration and 12 days (1-23) after candidate 2 administration. Total shedding, described by the estimated median shedding index (50% cell culture infective dose/g), was observed to be greater with candidate 1 than candidate 2 across all participants (2·8 [95% CI 1·8-3·5] vs 1·0 [0·7-1·6]). Reversion to neurovirulence, assessed as paralysis of transgenic mice, was low in isolates from those vaccinated with both candidates, and sequencing of shed virus indicated that there was no loss of attenuation in domain V of the 5ʹ-untranslated region, the primary site of reversion in Sabin OPV.

"Interpretation
"We found that the novel OPV2 candidates were safe and immunogenic in IPV-immunised adults, and our data support the further development of these vaccines to potentially be used for maintaining global eradication of neurovirulent type-2 polioviruses."
