One person has been confirmed dead and 49 others currently are isolated following an outbreak of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Lyantonde District.

According to the Lyantonde District Health Officer, Dr Moses Nkanika, [VB], 42, who was a businessman dealing in cattle, succumbed to the deadly disease on [Wed 31 Jul 2019].

"The blood samples we got from the deceased in Kasagama Sub County have tested positive for CCHF, not Ebola as earlier suspected," Dr Nkanika told Daily Monitor in an interview on Saturday morning [3 Aug 2019].

He said 49 residents who got in close contact with the deceased are currently isolated to avoid contacts with other people as health workers continue to monitor their health conditions.

"These people are expected to remain in isolation for 40 days until they are cleared by ministry of health," he said. He advised residents to be on alert and report any emergencies to the nearby health centres.

Mr Emmanuel Ainebyoona, the Ministry of Health spokesperson said he was not aware of the outbreak, but promised to crosscheck with other responsible authorities to confirm.

[CCHF has occurred sporadically in Uganda over recent years and is endemic there. It causes a viral hemorrhagic fever and the virus is transmitted by ticks. Mod.UBA has indicated that, "Uganda lies between countries that have frequent outbreaks of RVF [Rift Valley fever] and in which CCHF is endemic: Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania, and Sudan. A recent Food and Agriculture Organization risk analysis identified Uganda as at very high risk of amplification in some districts of the cattle corridor, which covers 52 districts cutting across the central part of the country from the southwest in Ankole-Kigezi to the northeastern region in Karamoja. The RVF virus has been isolated frequently in domestic animals in all affected areas. In addition, the practice of eating "sanga meat" (meat harvested from sick animals) in some districts heightens the risk of zoonotic transmission of both VHFs [viral hemorrhagic fevers, CCHF and Rift Valley fever]. At present, there is inadequate community engagement and social mobilization around the risks posed by these practices. Most of the 52 districts in the cattle corridor lack such engagement (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/273497/OEW30-2127072018.pdf)."

CCHF can cause serious disease in humans, with a case fatality rate of 10-40%. It can be responsible for severe outbreaks in humans, but it is not pathogenic for ruminants, their amplifying hosts. WHO states that the onset of symptoms in humans is sudden, with fever, myalgia, (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light). There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. After 2-4 days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression, and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement). Other clinical signs include tachycardia (fast heart rate), lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and a petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin) on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and on the skin.

Public education, especially among individuals in contact with livestock or their products, is needed to prevent cases of CCHF infection. A One Health approach is needed for effective surveillance, with effective communication between animal health and human health professionals. - Mod.TY
