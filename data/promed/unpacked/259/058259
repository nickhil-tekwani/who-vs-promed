New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 2
Outbreak 1: Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas
Date of start of the outbreak: 28 Mar 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Plain chacalaca: _Ortalis vetula_ (Cracidae) / - / 6 / 6 / 0 / 0
Clay-colored thrush: _Turdus grayi_ (Turdidae) / - / 2 / 2 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Endemic wild birds were reported having been found dead in a nature reserve called "The Zapotal;" the reserve is in the State of Chiapas, consists of 100 hectares of semi-humid forest with several species of sapotas, and shows a wide variety of native wildlife of this state. It has about 220 animal species in their natural environments and 154 species living freely in the reserve, of which there are 62 species of birds. During the initial investigation, 3 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the H7N3 subtype were isolated, with an intravenous pathogenicity index of 2.91 and 2.99. A 10-km focal and perifocal zone was established, and no evidence of infection was found in commercial poultry. Under the national epidemiological surveillance program, a state active epidemiological surveillance program is ongoing for 100 percent of the commercial poultry and, through a statistical sample size, in backyard poultry, based on serological, virological and molecular testing; no evidence of infection was found in commercial poultry or in backyard poultry. The affected species are _Ortalis vetula_ and _Turdus grayi_. The epidemiological investigation continues.

Control measures
Measures applied: control of wildlife reservoirs; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type:
Level 3 Biosecurity Laboratory, SENASICA (National laboratory)

The current H7 avian influenza outbreak is exclusively in hens and chickens, say specialists from the UNAM [National Autonomous University of Mexico], therefore the only species that would be sacrificed in the Miguel Alvarez del Toro Zoo (ZooMAT) would be the chickens in the supply area and chachalacas (_Ortalis vetula_), [grouse] belonging to the Galliformes order, which are released there.

Chachalacas abound in the Ecological Reserve "El Zapotal" where the ZooMAT is located. Chachalacas are the 2nd most abundant species followed by the common vulture (_Coragyps atratus_), while chickens are the food for some [zoo animals], says the study "Natural Areas and Conservation: The Case of Birdlife 'El Zapotal' " made by Dr. Yara Fernandez Moreno.

"For years at the zoo there have been outbreaks of avian influenza, which is a very specific disease for certain bird species. Hence the fact that managers of ZooMAT decided to sacrifice 100 chachalacas that are free in the reserve does not affect the population balance of the species because it is abundant," explains the researcher in an interview.

From the collection of ZooMAT fees, each year the remodeling of the site is carried out for national and international tourists for the summer season. The bird expert from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the UNAM, Nestor Ledesma Martinez clarified that the outbreak of bird flu 2 years ago, was with high mortality and exclusively in chickens, so it is not spread to humans.

[Mexico has been affected by a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), subtype H7N3, since June 2012.

The question asked in ProMED post 20150410.3288078 is still pending. That question was: It would be of interest to learn if any HPAI event occurred during the 2nd semester of 2014, and if so, what was its subtype, number of events, and location. See also commentaries in the indicated post.
