Mumps, city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 3 confirmed cases
------------------------------------------------------
Milwaukee reports 3 mumps cases.

The City of Milwaukee Health Department (MHD) has received reports of 3 confirmed cases of mumps infection in city residents, including area college students and community members.

Mumps is a contagious respiratory illness caused by the mumps virus. It is spread through the air by droplets and contact with saliva or mucus from infected persons. Mumps can be transmitted through coughing and sneezing as well as sharing food or beverage items and utensils with infected individuals.

Symptoms of mumps include fever, body aches, headaches, and swelling or pain of the salivary glands near the ears and jaw. Anyone who experiences these symptoms should contact his/her health care provider for diagnosis and testing.

The MHD recommends that persons experiencing symptoms consistent with mumps infection, especially swelling of one or both salivary glands, call your healthcare provider and stay home from work or school for a minimum of 5 days after the onset of swelling. Individuals are also advised to cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing and wash hands frequently with soap and water.

While most individuals recover fully, mumps infection can occasionally cause serious complications in adults that can include inflammation of the testicles in men or ovaries and breasts in women, inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), and temporary or permanent deafness.

Vaccination with 2 doses of mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) vaccine is the best way to prevent mumps infection. Public health officials advise individuals to be aware of their vaccination status, and seek advice from a health care provider if your vaccinations are not up to date.

Mumps: Health Officials in Eastern Nebraska announce cluster of cases in students at Midland University in Fremont
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mumps cluster reported at Midland University in Fremont on 20 May 2016.

Health officials in Eastern Nebraska announced today [20 May 2016] a cluster of mumps among college-aged young adults enrolled at Midland University in Fremont.

The Three Rivers Public Health Department says 10 cases to date.

A health advisory was sent to health care providers in Nebraska asking them to be on the lookout for cases of mumps and to contact their local health department about suspected cases.

Three Rivers Public Health Department wants the community to educate themselves about the symptoms, transmission, and prevention of mumps and to make sure he or she is fully vaccinated with the MMR vaccine to prevent this virus from spreading. Mumps clusters can happen even in highly vaccinated populations. Annually the number of reported mumps cases can range from a few hundred to a couple thousand in the United States.

"Mumps is highly contagious so it's important to practice good hygiene habits as that will help reduce illnesses. If you know someone who has mumps or suspect someone may have the disease, contact your physician or your local public health department," said Terra Uhing Executive Director, Three Rivers Public Health Department.

Mumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person, usually when the person coughs, sneezes or talks. Items used by an infected person, such as cups or soft drink cans, can also be contaminated with the virus, which may spread to others if those items are shared.

Symptoms typically appear 16-18 days after infection, but this period can range from 12-25 days after infection. It is usually a mild disease, but can occasionally cause serious complications.

The most common complication is inflammation of the testicles (orchitis) in males who have reached puberty; rarely does this lead to fertility problems.

Other rare complications include inflammation of the brain and/or tissue covering the brain and spinal cord (encephalitis/meningitis), inflammation of the ovaries (oophoritis) and/or breasts (mastitis) in females who have reached puberty, and deafness. Anyone who is not immune from either previous mumps infection or from vaccination can get mumps.

As of 29 Apr 2016, the CDC reports 727 mumps cases nationally.

The show will be going on at Harvard [Cambridge, Massachusetts]. The commencement, that is. An ongoing breakout of mumps won't impact the 26 May [2016] ceremony featuring director Steven Spielberg, even if the viral illness is making life miserable for nearly 5 dozen members of the Harvard community -- students, faculty and staff.

As of 12 May [2016], there were 59 confirmed cases of the illness, with 12 people in isolation, according to the most recent update by Cambridge health officials. That's up slightly from 41 cases in late April [2016].

Harvard University Health Services (HUHS) has been keeping the community informed of best practices for preventing the spread of the illness, and is working with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Cambridge Public Health Department, explains HUHS director Dr. Paul J. Barreira in a statement to TODAY.

The outbreak began in March [2016], but an increase in the number of cases isn't that unusual. "In a community with a large residential population, one would expect to see increasing cases of mumps," he says. Although Harvard community members were indeed vaccinated, the so-called MMR (mumps, measles, and rubella) vaccine offers different levels of protection depending on the illness.

The measles portion of the vaccine, for example, is about 93 percent effective with one dose, while 2 doses give people 97 percent protection, according to the CDC.

But the mumps portion is less effective. Two doses of mumps vaccine are 88 percent effective at preventing the illness, while one dose is 78 percent effective. "The measles vaccine is so good it spoils us," says Dr. Paul Sax, clinical director of Infectious Disease at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.

Although there are no plans to cancel graduation ceremonies, "given the 2- to 3-week incubation period for the mumps virus, students who come down with the virus at this point may have to miss certain end-of-year activities if they are ill," says Barreira.

Now that's a buzzkill, too, especially for any mumps-ridden graduating senior.

Students leaving campus for summer break and out of close proximity of each other will be a big help in curtailing the illness, he says.

Protecting yourself from mumps starts with vaccination, but there are also some common-sense things that people should be doing, he adds, citing hand washing, covering your mouth and nose when sneezing, and avoiding sharing cups and utensils.

"(Mumps) outbreaks have happened before, and they will happen again," says Sax, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. "But the message is this one will end."

Although mumps outbreaks vary from year to year and the vaccine is "not 100 percent effective," says Dr. Paul Sax, clinical director of Infectious Disease at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston -- without it there would have potentially been many more cases among the Harvard community, which numbers about 40 000 students, faculty and staff.
