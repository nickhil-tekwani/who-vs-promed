Human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus -- update -- 7 Mar 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
On [4 Mar 2014], the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health, Hong Kong SAR, China, notified WHO of an additional laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.

The patient is an 18-month-old girl who developed mild fever. She consulted a doctor on [28 Feb 2014], was admitted to a hospital on [1 Mar 2014] and was discharged from the hospital on [3 Mar 2014] in stable condition. Following laboratory-confirmation with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection on [4 Mar 2014], the patient was admitted to another hospital. She is currently asymptomatic, with no fever.

Initial epidemiological investigation revealed that the patient travelled to Foshan, Guangdong province from [5-27 Feb 2014], where she visited a wet market with her mother. Further investigations into her travel and exposure history are ongoing, including tracing of all close contacts.

Sporadic human cases
--------------------
The overall risk assessment has not changed (see WHO Risk Assessment at http://who.int/entity/influenza/human_animal_interface/RiskAssessment_H7N9_21Jan14.pdf?ua=1).

The previous report of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus detection in live poultry exported from mainland China to Hong Kong SAR shows the potential for the virus to spread through movement of live poultry, at this time there is no indication that international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) has occurred. However, as the virus infection does not cause signs of disease in poultry, continued surveillance is needed.

Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas.

Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans. Until the virus adapts itself for efficient human-to-human transmission, the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low.

WHO advice
----------
WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions.

As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.

WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.

Epidemiological investigation and follow-up actions by CHP on confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H7N9)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today [6 Mar 2014] provided an update on the 6th confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H7N9), which is affecting an 18-month-old girl.

"The epidemiological investigations, enhanced disease surveillance, port health measures and health education against avian influenza are all ongoing," a spokesman for the DH said.

As of 4pm today [6 Mar 2014], 13 close contacts and 117 other contacts have been identified.

The close contacts included household members of the patient, and patients and 2 visitors who had stayed in the same room with the patient in Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH). Among them, 2 are symptomatic and one of them tested positive for influenza A (H1) virus while the other tested negative for influenza A virus. Of the remaining 11 close contacts, 9 of them tested negative for influenza A virus while the other 2 tested positive for influenza A (H1) virus. They are now under quarantine.

Other contacts included healthcare workers, visitors, immigration staff at Lo Wu Control Point, and the doctor and patients of the private clinic which the patient consulted on [28 Feb 2014]. Among them, 2 are symptomatic and tested negative for influenza A virus. They are all under medical surveillance.

"In view of human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) confirmed locally and multiple cases notified by the Mainland, further cases are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas. Those planning to travel outside Hong Kong should maintain good personal, environmental and food hygiene at all times," the spokesman said.

China reported one more human H7N9 virus infection on Friday [7 Mar 2014].

The 88-year-old man, from Yuexiu District in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, was confirmed on Wednesday [5 Mar 2014] to have contracted the virus, according to the Guangdong Provincial Health and Family Planning Commission.

The patient, who has a history of hypertension and diabetes, is in critical condition now and is receiving treatment at a local hospital.

A patient from northeast China's Jilin Province, who was confirmed to be infected with H7N9 bird flu on [21 Feb 2014], has recovered and been discharged from the hospital, the provincial health and family planning commission said on Friday [7 Mar 2014].

China has reported more than 120 human H7N9 cases this year [2014], including at least 36 deaths.

[Cases continue to occur in China. The results of the contact screening on the 18-month-old child in Hong Kong are interesting in that of the 13 close contacts, 2 were symptomatic, of which one tested positive for influenza virus (H1), the other negative; of the asymptomatic contacts, 9 were negative for influenza A virus and 2 were positive for influenza A (H1) virus, suggesting that the most common influenza virus circulating in the area is influenza A (H1) and that there continues to be no evidence of significant human-to-human transmission of the influenza A(H7N9) virus.

Following the case tallies available at the Hong Kong CHP website, as of 6 Mar 2014 there have been a total of 375 laboratory-confirmed human infections with influenza A(H7N9) virus.
