A middle-aged man who transported poultry for a living and another unidentified person have died from a new strain of bird flu, bringing the death toll to 5 among 14 confirmed cases in China, the government and state media reported Thursday [4 Apr 2013]. The 48-year-old man, who died in Shanghai, is one of several among the infected believed to have had direct contact with fowl. Until recently, the virus, called H7N9, was not known to infect humans. The official Xinhua News Agency did not identify the 5th fatality, but said that person also died in Shanghai on Wednesday [3 Apr 2013]. It said the Ministry of Agriculture confirmed on Thursday [4 Apr 2013] that the H7N9 virus had been detected in pigeons at a market selling agricultural products in Shanghai.

It is not known how people are becoming sick with the virus, but health officials and scientists caution that there are no indications it can be transmitted from one person to another. Scientists who have studied the virus's genetic sequence said this week that the virus may have mutated, spreading more easily to other animals and potentially posing a bigger threat to humans.

Guidelines issued Wednesday [3 Apr 2013] by the national health agency identify butchers, breeders and sellers of poultry, and those in the meat processing industry as at higher risk. Experts only identified the 1st cases on Sunday [31 Mar 2013]. Some among the 14 confirmed cases fell ill several weeks ago but only now are being classified as having H7N9. Xinhua said 6 cases have been confirmed in Shanghai, 4 in Jiangsu, 3 in Zhejiang, and one in Anhui. [Now 20 confirmed -- 14 in ProMED archive human (26) case list plus 2 in [3] below].

East China's Zhejiang Province on Friday [5 Apr 2013] morning reported that a man has died from the H7N9 bird flu, bringing the death toll from the new deadly strain to 6 in the country. The city has reported 3 infections to date, and 2 have died, the Health Bureau of Zhejiang Province said Friday [5 Apr 2013].

According to the health bureau, the 64-year-old man, who is a peasant farmer of Huzhou City, died at hospital after rescue efforts failed on Thursday [4 Apr 2013] night, and it was confirmed he was infected with the H7N9 strain. So far, 55 people who had close contact with him have shown no abnormal symptoms.

China has confirmed 14 H7N9 cases -- 6 in Shanghai, 4 in Jiangsu, 3 in Zhejiang, and one in Anhui -- in the 1st known human infections of this lesser-known strain. [Now 14 confirmed -- see [3] & ProMED archive human (26) below].

Shanghai authorities on Thursday [4 Apr 2013] reported 4 deaths, with Zhejiang now reporting 2.

According to the Jiangsu Health Department on 5 Apr 2013, 2 new cases of H7N9 avian influenza infection were confirmed.

The 1st case is a 61-year-old female who lives in Qinhuai District, Nanjing city. She is retired and stays at home. She began to sicken on 20 Mar 2013 and was admitted to a hospital in Nanjing as her symptoms got worse. At present, she is in critical condition and receiving emergency treatments.

On 3 Apr 2013, the laboratory test from Jiangsu provincial CDC revealed nucleic acid weakly positive for H7N9 avian influenza virus. In the morning of 5 Apr 2013, the provincial CDC collected a specimen by deep lung aspiration, which resulted nucleic acid positive for H7N9 avian influenza virus. In the afternoon of 5 Apr 2013, as per the treatment guidelines for human infection with H7N9 avian influenza (1st edition of 2013) issued by the National Health and Family Planning Commission, experts diagnosed this case as H7N9 avian influenza infection. After investigation, 12 close contacts were identified, but none of them have respiratory symptoms.

The 2nd case is a 79-year-old male from Qinhuai District, Nanjing City. He became sick on 21 Mar 2013 and was admitted to a hospital in Nanjing due to severe symptoms. This case is also in critical condition now, and emergency treatment is being provided to this patient.

During the night of 2 Apr 2013, the laboratory from Jiangsu CDC found nucleic acid [from this case] preliminarily tested weakly positive for H7N9 avian influenza infection. Another laboratory test on 4 Apr 2013 also showed nucleic acid weakly positive for H7N9. On the morning of 5 Apr 2013, the provincial CDC collected a specimen by deep lung aspiration, which revealed nucleic acid positive for H7N9 avian influenza virus. In the afternoon of 5 Apr 2013, according to the treatment guidelines for human infection with H7N9 avian influenza (1st edition of 2013) issued by the National Health and Family Planning Commission, experts diagnosed this case as H7N9 avian influenza infection. A total of 53 close contacts were found after investigation, but none of them have fever or respiratory symptoms as of yet.

On the afternoon of 5 Apr 2013, experts were investigating 2 unexplained pneumonia cases (one from Binhu District, Wuxi City and one from Wujiang District, Suzhou City). Due to lack of sufficient evidence, they were diagnosed as suspected cases as per the guidelines mentioned above.

Experts from Jiangsu Health Department are working hard to save the lives of these patients and are implementing epidemic prevention and control measures. Until now, Jiangsu has confirmed 6 cases of H7N9 avian influenza infection.

[4] Shanghai, sick contact negative, markets closed, pigeon was for sale for food

One person who had been in close contact with a victim had shown flu-like symptoms but tested negative for H7N9, Shanghai city health official Wu Fan told a press conference.

Shanghai has ordered all live poultry markets in the city closed after culling more than 20 000 birds to curb the spread of the H7N9 flu virus, which has killed 6 people in China. Shanghai has a population of 23 million people, and city government spokesman Xu Wei said its live poultry markets were being shuttered temporarily for "public safety" purposes, and all trade in live poultry banned.

The moves came after the virus was found in samples from a pigeon from the Huhuai market in Shanghai, where Xinhua said a total of 20 536 chickens, ducks, geese, and pigeons had been slaughtered. [OIE reports that the positive pigeon was among those being sold for food. See photos in Comment at end.]

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has played down fears over the H7N9 strain, saying there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission, but that it was crucial to find out how the virus infects humans. Like the H5N1 variant which typically spreads from birds to humans through direct contact, experts fear such viruses could mutate into a form easily transmissible between humans, with the potential to trigger a pandemic. Shanghai city health official Wu Fan also said on Friday [5 Apr 2013] that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission.

The state-run China Daily on Friday [5 Apr 2013] quoted the ministry of health in Beijing as pledging "open and transparent exchanges with the WHO and other countries and regions." In 2003, Chinese officials were accused of trying to cover up the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which killed about 800 people across the world. US health authorities said on Thursday [4 Apr 2013] that they were liaising with domestic and international partners to develop a vaccine for the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a US federal agency, said it was "gathering more information to make a knowledgeable public health risk assessment and developing a candidate vaccine virus." According to the WHO, the animal source of the infection and its mode of transmission are not yet clear. "We do not yet know enough about these infections to determine whether there is a significant risk of community spread," the UN's health agency said in an online H7N9 update.

Experts are concerned that the virus appears to have spread across a wide geographical area, with people sickened not only in Shanghai but also in the nearby provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Anhui.

[5] Hong Kong, suspected case
Date: Fri 5 Apr 2013

Hong Kong on Friday [5 Apr 2013] will step up its control measures against the new bird flu strain that has killed 6 people in eastern China after a Hong Kong girl showed flu symptoms following a visit to Shanghai.

The 7-year-old has become the 1st suspected case of the H7N9 bird flu virus in Hong Kong. The girl has now been put in an isolation ward in Queen Elizabeth Hospital for further observation to confirm whether she has contracted the virus. She showed avian flu-like symptoms, including fever, after visiting Shanghai in late March 2013. During the trip, the girl had contact with birds, health officials said. "Respiratory specimens are being taken from the girl, and a rapid test is being conducted," said Dr Dominic Tsang Ngai-chong, the Hospital Authority's chief infection control officer. He added that the results were expected later on Friday [5 Apr 2013].

The suspected case came as Hong Kong officials were trying to ward off any chance of the deadly H7N9 bird flu outbreak spreading to the city. The mainland cases have alerted a Hong Kong that is revisiting lessons from the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic of 10 years ago.

Secretary for Food and Health Dr Ko Wing-man said the city would step up control measures now. These included enhancing surveillance on poultry imports from the mainland and of travellers at the border. If any poultry or wild birds were to be found infected with avian flu, including the H5 and H7 strains, Ko said the government might order the culling of live poultry stocks in the city. He said Hong Kong's live and frozen chickens mainly come from registered farms in the southern provinces of Guangdong and Hainan, and no stocks were imported from eastern China. More health inspectors will also be deployed to border checkpoints to check the body temperatures of travellers, and more frequent inspection and cleaning will be conducted in markets.

Hong Kong health experts will meet their mainland counterparts on Saturday and Sunday [6-7 Apr 2013] to discuss other control measures, Ko said. The development comes as a 6th person in China died of the virus. The latest fatality was a 64-year-old farmer who died in Huzhou, in the eastern province of Zhejiang, local officials said, according to the state Xinhua news agency.

He was one of the 16 [now 18] confirmed human cases of H7N9 and is the 2nd person from Zhejiang to die from the strain, with the other 4 fatalities in Shanghai, China's commercial hub. In Shanghai, a poultry cull was carried out at the Huhuai market in a western suburb of Shanghai following the discovery of the virus in pigeon samples, Xinhua reported.

[6] WHO Update
Date: Thu 4 Apr 2013
Source: WHO CSR Disease Outbreak News [edited]
http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_04_04/en/index.html


The Chinese health authorities notified WHO of an additional 4 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 3 deaths, due to human infection with influenza A(H7N9). The 3 fatal cases, all men, are a 38-year-old with illness onset on 7 Mar 2013 from Zhejiang, a 64-year-old with illness onset on 29 Mar 2013 from Zhejiang, and a 48-year-old with illness onset on 28 Mar 2013 from Shanghai. The 4th patient is a 67-year-old man with illness onset on 25 Mar 2013 from Zhejiang. He is in critical condition.

There is no link between these laboratory-confirmed cases. To date, the total number of confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus in China is 11, including 5 deaths [now 14 and 6 deaths -- see ProMED archive human (26) below and reports [1] & [2] above]. More than 400 close contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored. Thus far, none of them have developed any symptoms of illness [one with symptoms has tested negative, see [5] above].

The Chinese government is actively investigating this event and has heightened disease surveillance. Retrospective testing of recently reported cases with severe respiratory infection may uncover additional cases that were previously unrecognized. An inter-governmental task force has been formally established, with the Chinese National Health and Family Planning Commission leading the coordination along with the Ministry of Agriculture and other key ministries. The animal health sector has intensified investigations into the possible sources and reservoirs of the virus.

WHO is in contact with national authorities and is following the event closely. The WHO-coordinated international response is also focusing on work with WHO Collaborating Centres for Reference and Research on Influenza and other partners to ensure that information is available and that materials are developed for diagnosis and treatment and vaccine development. No vaccine is currently available for this subtype of the influenza virus.

Susceptible to antivirals
-------------------------
Preliminary test results provided by the WHO Collaborating Centre in China suggest that the virus is susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir).

At this time, there is no evidence of ongoing human-to-human transmission. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.
