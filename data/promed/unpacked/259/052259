Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Pakistan
--------------------------------------------------
From 1 Jan 2013 to 9 Jun 2013, a total of 16 suspected cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), including 6 deaths (case-fatality rate 37.5 percent) were reported from Pakistan. So far, 7 of these reported cases have been laboratory-confirmed. In 2012, the country faced a similar outbreak of CCHF with 61 suspected cases, including 17 deaths (case-fatality rate 27.8 percent) reported from the disease. The majority of the cases were reported from the provinces of Balochistan, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is endemic in Pakistan; cases have been reported sporadically since 2000, and often localized outbreaks are reported in established foci.

Table: Suspected cases of CCHF reported in Pakistan, 2000-2012

2000-2002 / 191 / 59 / 26.2

2003-2006 / 328 / 42 / 12.8

2010 / 29 / 3 / 4.9

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. CCHF outbreaks have a case fatality rate of up to 40 percent. The virus is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals. Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons. CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia, in countries south of the 50th parallel north.

The hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep and goats. Many birds are resistant to infection, but ostriches are susceptible and may show a high prevalence of infection in endemic areas, where they have been at the origin of human cases. There is no apparent disease in these animals. Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vector.

CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles and contamination of medical supplies. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1 to 3 days, with a maximum of 9 days. The incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually 5 to 6 days, with a documented maximum of 13 days. The mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30 percent, with death occurring in the 2nd week of illness. In patients who recover, improvement generally begins on the 9th or 10th day after the onset of illness. - Mod.CP
