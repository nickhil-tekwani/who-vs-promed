As of 27 May 2014, a total of 126 persons infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotypes] Infantis or Newport have been reported from 26 states. Since the last update on 8 May 2014, a total of 66 new ill persons have been reported from 18 states: Alabama (4), Colorado (1), Georgia (5), Illinois (1), Indiana (1), Kentucky (2), Maine (4), Montana (1), New Hampshire (1), New Mexico (1), New York (6), North Carolina (11), Ohio (7), Pennsylvania (7), South Carolina (3), Tennessee (5), Virginia (5), and West Virginia (1).

Among the persons who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began between and 4 Feb 2014 and 15 May 2014. Ill persons range in age from younger than one year to 95 years, and the median age is 28 years. 39 percent of ill persons are 10 years of age or younger. 50 percent of ill persons are female. Among 81 ill persons with available information, 28 (35 percent) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback investigations conducted by officials in local, state, and federal public health agencies indicate that contact with live poultry sourced from Mt. Healthy Hatcheries in Ohio is the likely source of this outbreak of Salmonella infections.

Interviews with newly reported ill persons about their exposures in the week before becoming ill continue to be conducted. To date, 72 (82 percent) of 88 ill persons interviewed reported contact with live poultry (e.g., chicks, chickens, ducks, ducklings) before becoming ill. Eight (11 percent) of 72 reported contact with only adult chickens, and 5 (7 percent) of 72 reported contact with only ducklings. The median time from acquiring live poultry and illness onset was 24 days, with a range of 3 to 468 days. Samples from live poultry and the environments where the poultry live and roam were collected from an ill person's home in Vermont. Testing of these samples yielded one of the outbreak strains of Salmonella Infantis. These birds were sourced from Mt. Healthy Hatcheries.

Mt. Healthy Hatcheries sells birds to many different retailers. 52 (90 percent) of 58 ill persons with available purchase information reported purchasing live poultry from 7 different feed or farm store companies in multiple states. Ill persons reported purchasing live poultry for backyard flocks to produce eggs or meat or to keep as pets.

[It may well be the case that Mt. Healthy is a substantial supplier of live chicks and ducklings overall, which it makes it a recurrent source of salmonellosis from these young fowl.

To minimize human salmonellosis from contact with such birds:
- Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water right after touching live baby poultry or anything in the area where they live and roam;
- Use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available;
- Adults should supervise hand washing for young children;
- Clean any equipment or materials associated with raising or caring for live poultry outside the house, such as cages or feed or water containers;
- Don't let children younger than 5 years of age, older adults, or people with weak immune systems handle or touch chicks, ducklings, or other live poultry;
- Don't snuggle or kiss the birds, touch your mouth, or eat or drink around live baby poultry;
- Don't let live baby poultry inside the house, in bathrooms, or especially in areas where food or drink is prepared, served, or stored, such as kitchens or outdoor patios;
- Don't eat or drink in the area where the birds live or roam;
- Don't give live baby poultry as gifts to young children. - Mod.LL
