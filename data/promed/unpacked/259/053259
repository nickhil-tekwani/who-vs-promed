Acute diarrheal syndrome and identification of 2 cholera cases: Sao Bento
do Una, Pernambuco State, Brazil
--------------------------------------------------------------
From epidemiological weeks (EWs) 4 to 11, an increase in the number of
cases of acute diarrhea has been detected in the municipality of Sao Bento
do Una, state of Pernambuco, Brazil, similar to the peak that occurred
during the 1st trimester of 2003.
2 cases with serious acute diarrhea tested positive for _Vibrio cholerae_
O1 Ogawa (a girl aged 2 years and a man of 39y) in a Sao Bento do Una
neighborhood. The cases arose on 27 Mar and 6 Apr 2004. Samples from the
examinations carried out identified toxigenic strains in these 2 patients.
Results from ongoing studies will later show the genotypical
characterization of this strain. The environmental samples and feces
samples taken from other patients from the same neighborhood tested
negative for cholera.
Epidemiological monitoring of acute diarrhea cases has been intensified in
all the municipalities, as well as surveillance of drinking-water quality.
Prevention and control activities include distributing hypochlorite to the
population, as well as intensive activities to ensure safe drinking water
distribution. The public is being informed of what to do, and health care
professionals are being trained on how to identify and treat new cases, as
well as on how to procure the necessary input for adequate case management.
Since 2nd semester 2001, no cholera cases from this strain have been
detected. Between 1991 and 2001, 168 598 cases of cholera were reported to
the Ministry of Health, the last being reported in 2001 and all originating
in the north eastern region. During 2002 and 2003, _V. cholerae_ 01 Ogawa
was isolated in 6 environmental samples from the north eastern states,
though the results of the analysis carried out turned out negative for
toxigenic strains.
Health authorities are investigating the current identification of cholera
cases in the municipality of Sao Bento do Una. For the time being, it is
not possible to say that _V. cholerae_ is the agent responsible for the
increase of diarrhea cases, since no toxigenic strains have been identified
in other clinical and environmental samples. Ongoing research will
elucidate the factors implied in such an increase and in the occurrence of
the 2 cholera cases.

A total of 136 cholera cases have been treated in North West hospitals
since the outbreak of the disease in Kanana Township near Klerksdorp
earlier in Mar 2004. The Department of Health in the North West reported
that as of yesterday, 13 patients still remained at the Klerksdorp/Tshepong
Hospital Complex. It said 3 patients were positively diagnosed with cholera
while 11 others were still being monitored. The department said the death
toll from the disease still stood at 2 and further reports were being received.
Health officials in the province are now focusing on a "Wash Campaign" in
conjunction with other health promotions to counter the spread of the
disease. "Through this campaign, we are encouraging communities to wash all
household items such as cooking utensils, food, bedding etc before use.
We've established that the main form of spreading the disease is through
person-to-person contact, so we are urging people to adhere to basic
hygiene practices," explained Barba Gaoganediwe, spokesperson for the
department.
The department added that only 3 patients were hospitalized over the past 3
days. "This is good news for the community of Kanana and confirms that our
health promotion work and the wash campaign we started last week are
yielding fruits," said Mr Gaoganediwe.
