CDC seeks to sample Virginia waters for deadly amoeba
-----------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is asking
Virginia for help sampling state waterways as it attempts to develop a
test for detecting microscopic amoebas that have caused 3 U.S. deaths
this year.

This month, a 9-year-old Henrico County boy died after being exposed
to _Naegleria fowleri_, which swims up nasal passages and burrows into
the brain, causing a fatal infection known as primary amoebic
meningoencephalitis.

The patient had visited several bodies of water during a Richmond
fishing camp the previous week. A Louisiana man and a Florida girl
also died after exposure to the amoeba this summer. In total, more
than 120 people have died of the waterborne amoeba since it was
identified in the early 1960s, the CDC reports.

The CDC knows little about the free-living amoebas, which can be found
in bodies of freshwater around the country, said Michael Beach, the
federal agency's associate director for healthy water.

"It's a terrible disease that we would like to know more about and be
able to tell the public more about from a prevention standpoint," he
said. "We are trying to learn more, but it's a tough one because it's
such a rare occurrence." He said the Atlanta-based agency wants to
know why millions of people come in contact with the amoebas every
year by swimming in their local ponds and lakes, but only a few die.
"That's the million-dollar question," he said. "We have no idea."

He said scientists want to know if there is something anatomically
different about children who were infected -- the average age of
victims is 12 -- or if there are differences in the amoebas
themselves. They want to know if a person is more likely to get
infected if there is a higher quantity of the amoebas. And they wonder
if being infected by an amoeba is "just a very rare event and the
person happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and one
amoeba is floating by."

"Our take on this is the 1st thing to do is have a good test," he
said. "Then, you can start to ask, 'With all these other things
changing, how does that affect Naegleria?'"

He said the test being developed would use an antibody that would act
as a magnet to pull the amoeba out of a volume of water. He has talked
with Virginia's Department of Health about pulling samples from some
of its waterways that could be used to test the test, Beach said. He
said it could happen as soon as this summer or possibly next summer.

"We don't have the staffing or resources to be able to do that
remotely," Beach said.

He said the CDC does not recommend that states sample waterways after
an amoebic meningoencephalitis case because the current tests are so
unreliable. Virginia has not sampled any waterways in the aftermath of
Christian's death, nor has it closed any ponds or lakes.

"We're not going to be able to pinpoint where he contracted the
amoeba," said Dr. Keri Hall, the state epidemiologist for the
Department of Health.

She said the patient had visited multiple bodies of water, including
the James River.

Amebic meningoencephalitis from irrigating sinuses
--------------------------------------------------
Health officials say two children and a young adult have died this
summer from a microscopic amoeba that lives in water. The amoeba goes
up the nose and burrows up into the skull. Most cases of the rare
infection are caught while swimming in lakes or ponds. However,
Louisiana officials linked the June death of a young man to the tap
water he used to flush out his sinuses.

[Free living amoeba are most probably ubiquitous and would be expected
to be found in most fresh water bodies. Most _Neagleria fowleri_
samples adapted to in vitro culture grow best at temperature between
25 deg C and 32 deg C (77 - 89.6 deg F), which probably explain that
exposure rarely result in invasive infection. The case from Louisiana
underlines that flushing of the nasal sinus should be done with
sterile water. - Mod.EP]
