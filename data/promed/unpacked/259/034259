Fungus attacks sugar cane crops
-------------------------------
Queensland canegrowers are being urged not to panic after a debilitating
crop disease was discovered in supposedly resistant cane varieties.

Sugarcane research company BSES has been behind a drive to replace cane
varieties susceptible to smut with resistant varieties in an effort to
overcome the disease. BSES moved yesterday to downplay fears the disease
could affect the new varieties after it was detected in 3 fields of
resistant crops. Two affected fields were in the Herbert region, and the
other was at Bundaberg in the state's south east.

Biosecurity expert Barry Croft said it was not unusual for the airborne
spores to infect resistant crops in those regions heavily affected by the
disease. "The susceptible varieties are producing vast amounts of smut
spores that are putting pressure on resistant and intermediate varieties,"
he said. "The lower levels of disease in resistant varieties should have
minimal effect on yield."

Call made for calm on smut issue
--------------------------------
Fears about smut resistant sugarcane being found infected with the disease
in north Queensland appears not to have turned Bundaberg growers off the
Q200 variety. Bundaberg Canegrowers chairman Allan Dingle said he was
unconcerned by the smut discovery in the Q200 variety in Ingham. "All
varieties have some susceptibility, but on a scale of one to 9, one being
the best, Q200 is a one, so it will not endanger productivity," Mr Dingle
said. He said 99 per cent of the canegrowers in Bundaberg were growing
resistant varieties.

Isis Canegrowers chairman Joe Russo said removing susceptible varieties was
still the best way to battle the cane disease. "I don't think we will ever
get rid of smut outright, it's about managing it properly with resistant
varieties," Mr Russo said. "It's nothing to get overwhelmed about, but it
does stress the importance of getting rid of susceptible varieties. The
disease devastates the profitability of sugarcane crops by significantly
reducing their productivity and yield. Resistant varieties like Q200 are
considered by experts to be less likely to be affected, and retain better
productivity if they are."

Smut spreads across Queensland
------------------------------
Sugarcane smut continues to spread across Queensland, with the fungal
disease found yesterday [26 Feb 2008] on a property in the Innisfail area.
The latest find is the most northerly outbreak, and Joseph Morano from
Canegrowers says it has infected a popular cane variety. "The variety that
smut was found on is Q166, it's a very good variety for the dry areas of
the district," he says. "It's one of our major varieties and there's not
too much you can replace it with at this stage either, so that is a concern
to people."

Smut disease spreads in Australia sugar industry
------------------------------------------------
Sugarcane smut disease, which affects productivity, had spread to the
Innisfail district in north east Queensland state, the Bureau of Sugar
Experiment Stations [BSES] said on Wednesday [27 Feb 2008].

This follows the 1st discovery of the fungal disease in the Australian
sugarcane crop early last year [2007] in the Bundaberg region, about 280
kilometres (174 miles) north of the city of Brisbane. It later spread
northwards to Mackay and Townsville, around 200 kilometres south of Innisfail.

"Being a windborne fungal disease, there was a high chance it would spread
to the Innisfail area, but it is still unfortunate that such an incursion
has now occurred," BSES chief executive officer Eoin Wallis said on
Wednesday. The disease had recently intensified in the Herbert district,
about 150 km south of Innisfail, he said. However, the Tully district
between the Herbert and Innisfail districts remained free of smut, he said.

Smut is a highly contagious fungal disease which stunts plants and impedes
re-growth. It is believed to have been carried into Queensland by spores
borne through the upper atmosphere from the west, probably from Indonesia.
BSES is a research organisation servicing Australia's sugar cane industry.
The Australian sugar industry stretches 2000 kilometres along the
Queensland coastline, and is the world's 3rd-largest exporter.

[Sugarcane smut is caused by the fungus _Sporisorium scitamineum_. It is
highly contagious and can be spread by wind or carried on clothing and
machinery. Symptoms are a black whip-like structure emerging from the
central core of meristematic tissues. The whip contains spores covered with
a thin membrane which ruptures easily to release the spores. Smut spores
survive for long periods in soil or plant debris. Disease management may
include removal of inoculum, burning of infected cane fields, fungicides
and use of clean planting material. However, smut control is best achieved
by using resistant cane cultivars available for different regions.

Australia was the last cane growing country worldwide considered to be free
of smut until the disease was found in 1998 in Western Australia, a minor
cane growing area, and in June 2006 in Queensland. In less than 2 years it
has spread to all the main sugar growing regions of Queensland, despite
efforts to contain the disease. Existing cane varieties are being screened
for smut resistance, management and monitoring programmes have been
implemented, and development of high-yielding resistant cultivars
continues. A programme of replacing susceptible with smut resistant
varieties is in progress. Replacement is mandatory when replanting, but
ratoon crops of already planted susceptible varieties may still be
harvested. It will, therefore, take several years before a complete
transition to resistant varieties will be achieved.

The term 'resistant' is often used loosely for plant varieties to include
complete or partial resistance or tolerance to a pathogen. This may lead to
confusion, as it has in the news stories above. 'Resistance' describes a
situation when a plant cannot be infected by a pathogen, while 'tolerance'
will allow the host to survive despite the infection. The cane varieties
referred to above appear to have varying degrees of tolerance, since smut
is reported to still develop on them, but at a lower level and without
affecting yield.
