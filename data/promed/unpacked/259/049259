After a cluster of ocular syphilis was identified in Washington State in December 2014, small outbreaks have since occurred in San Francisco and now apparently Los Angeles, Outbreak News Today reports.

The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has issued a health advisory asking primary health care physicians, HIV and infectious disease specialists, and eye care providers to be on the lookout for the rare disease among those complaining of vision problems who are at risk for syphilis.

Of the 6 cases in Washington [State], 3 were among men who have sex with men (MSM) and 3 among HIV-positive people (with a likely overlap). Two of those individuals went blind. There have been 7 reported cases in San Francisco and 2 suspected cases in Los Angeles. Most syphilis cases in L.A. County are among MSM.

[The following comment on ocular syphilis is extracted from moderator DK's comments in a prior ProMED-mail post (Syphilis, ocular - Australia (NSW, VIC) 20070515.1547):

"Syphilis may result in 3 classic stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary syphilis. The eye may be involved in any of the 3 stages. Primary syphilis is characterized by the development of a painless chancre (ulcer) at the site of inoculation, typically in the genital area. The lesion appears about 4 weeks after infection, and heals about 6 to 8 weeks later. It may rarely occur on the conjunctiva.

"Untreated, primary syphilis may progress to secondary syphilis within 4 to 12 months. There is fever and a rash. Ocular complications of inflammation can involve any structure of the eye. Tertiary syphilis may follow untreated secondary syphilis.

In the secondary stage of syphilis, 10 percent of patients may develop inflammatory signs and symptoms involving virtually any structure of the eye (e.g., conjunctivitis, iritis, vitritis, episcleritis, scleritis, neuroretinitis, chorioretinitis, and retinal detachment). Tertiary syphilis may cause granulomatous disease of any structure of the eye as well as abnormal pupillary findings, oculomotor palsies, and glaucoma. Blindness may result."

With the resurgence of syphilis in men who have sex with men (MSM), ocular syphilis (1) has been noted among MSM who are co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), regardless of CD4 count or evidence of neurosyphilis on the basis of a reactive CSF VDRL test result (2), which may reflect an increased risk of central nervous system penetration by _Treponema pallidum_ in these patients. Ocular syphilis has also been reported in HIV-negative MSM (3).

However, a small cluster of cases of ocular syphilis had been reported on the West Coast of the U.S. in 2008 in 3 men and a woman who were HIV-negative and were either MSM or are linked epidemiologically to MSM (4). More recently, clusters of ocular syphilis have been reported among MSM on the West Coast in late 2014 and 2015 in the news release above and elsewhere (5), which may suggest a particularly virulent strain of _Treponema pallidum_ with a greater tendency to cause ocular syphilis.
