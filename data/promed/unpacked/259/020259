A horse in Wayne county [Missouri] has been diagnosed with eastern
equine encephalitis, [caused by] a virus which is transmitted to
horses by mosquitoes. Mosquitoes can also transmit the virus to
humans, and according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the
virus can cause brain inflammation, coma, or death. The virus has an
approximately 1/3 mortality rate for humans.

The CDC website states that the virus can be avoided by avoiding
mosquito bites. Mosquito bites can be avoided by using an
EPA-registered repellent, wearing protective clothing, avoiding
outdoor activity when mosquitoes are active, and removing standing
water that can provide mosquito-breeding sites. More information on
the virus and other mosquito-borne diseases is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov>.

Dr. Alison Moore of Seal-Laird Veterinary Hospital said the horse that
was diagnosed with the virus has died. Encephalitis cannot be
transmitted from horses to humans. The virus is transmitted from birds
to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to both horses and humans. Infection
of a horse does not increase the risk of infection of a human, but it
is an indicator that [infected] mosquitoes are active. Being around
horses does not increase a person's risk of contracting encephalitis,
but being around mosquitoes does.

The infection of a horse does not necessarily indicate that the risk
of contracting encephalitis for humans is higher than normal.

Virginia's 1st case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a horse
this year [2009] has been confirmed by the Virginia Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS).

The horse, a 2-year-old female draft cross from Chesapeake, was
confirmed positive for EEE late in the afternoon of 10 Jul 2009.

A veterinarian euthanized the horse prior to diagnosis on 3 Jul 2009
due to the severity of her clinical signs, which included
incoordination, depression, and fever (105 F), progressing to an
inability to stand without help.

This is the 1st reported case of EEE in a horse in Virginia this year
[2009]. Last year, the state had only one case, reported in September
2008. So far, there have been no reported cases of West Nile virus
(WNV) in Virginia horses this year.

In an April 2009 press release, Richard Wilkes, DVM, state
veterinarian encouraged horse owners to work with their veterinarians
to plan a vaccination schedule that would protect their horses from
EEE. Available vaccines are effective in drastically reducing the
incidence of both EEE and WNV in horses. The vaccines are effective
for 6 to 12 months, so horses should be re-vaccinated at least
annually. In an area where the disease occurs frequently, such as
southeast and Tidewater Virginia, most veterinarians recommend
vaccination every 6 months.

For the vaccine to be effective, it must be handled and administered
properly and be given at least 2 weeks before the horse is exposed to
the virus. Additionally, to stimulate full immunity, horses must be
vaccinated twice, about 30 days apart, the 1st year of vaccination.
Generally, EEE is transmitted by mosquitoes. Other prevention methods
include destroying standing water breeding sites for mosquitoes, using
insect repellents, and removing animals from mosquito-infested areas
during peak biting times, usually dusk to dawn.

[Vaccinations are combined with other encephalitis vaccines such as
West Nile virus and western equine encephalitis. Protection from
eastern equine encephalitis wanes more quickly than the others and
should be given more often, perhaps every 6 months. - Mod.TG]
