Today [6 Feb 2012], the government declared a health alert in the Bio Bio region in the south due to a serious outbreak of [a] hantavirus in a prison, which has caused the deaths of 2 inmates, with 5 more under observation, the Minister of Health, Jaime Manalich, stated.

"The situation is serious," regional governor Victor Lobos declared this morning [6 Feb 2012]. He said: "The probability that (the outbreak) will worsen is real but not inevitable."

The inmates died between this past Wednesday and Friday [1-3 Feb 2012].

The [Health] Minister did not discard [the idea] that the forest fires that recently affected the region may have contributed to the rapid expansion of the outbreak, since the long-tailed rodents [pygmy rice rats], carriers of the virus, had to leave and find food closer to the city.

Regional authorities this weekend stated that among measures put into place to contain the outbreak in the El Manzano II prison, located 500 km [311 miles] south of Santiago, are placement of fine screens on openings to rain pipes where access by rodents was thought to occur, intensive cleanup of the yards where there are weeds, and the placement of traps.

The minister added that together with the declaration of the health alert in the region, they have begun to distribute sanitary packets with bleach and masks and informational flyers for the populace.

[Over the past week, the press in Chile and other South American countries have been carrying numerous reports that are essentially the same as this one and the following one, with most of the same quotes from the Chile Minister of Health. Two of the deaths have been confirmed due to a hantavirus infection, doubtless Andes virus. It is implied that there are rodent hosts, the long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_, inside the prison and immediately around it, although there is no mention made of any rodents being captured and tested for Andes virus. Andes virus can be transmitted directly from person to person, but only among individuals in very close physical contact. No mention is made of that type of contact in these reports, although 2 infected individuals were reported to have shared a cell.

The Minister of Health, Jaime Manalich, stated yesterday [5 Feb 2012] that a prisoner in the El Manzano prison in Concepcion was admitted to the city [Guillermo Grant Benavente] Regional Hospital for a possible hantavirus infection.

Also, he indicated that the other 2 inmates suspected of having the infection were notified by the Institute of Public Health that their tests proved negative for [a] hantavirus [infection], and they were released [from hospital] in recent hours. Moreover, the minister indicated that another 37 prisoners are under observation, since they were in the same area of the prison where the inmates died due to the disease.

The virus has taken the lives of 3 people in the Bio Bio region, the most recent a 41-year-old man from Los Angeles, whose family filed a complaint for negligence to the Tucapl Hospital, where in previous days before he died, he went for a consultation due to his symptoms and was told that he had lumbago.

Today [6 Feb 2012], a health alert began in Concepcion, and meanwhile Minister Manalich called for the populace to prevent [transmission] of the virus by cleanup. And so in the prison, where the 1st case occurred, work to remove weeds and clean up of trash around the prison began last week.

Also, the prison security force ordered an internal investigation to determine the cause of the infection. Unofficial sources placed the 2 individuals who died in the same cell in that area of the prison.

[Although 2 inmates were negative for a hantavirus infection test, there is no indication as to what the etiology of their infection might have been. ProMED would be interested in knowing whether the other suspected cases of Andes virus or other hantavirus infections are confirmed or discarded after laboratory tests are conducted by the Institute of Public Health.

A 43-year-old man residing in Santiago is the 1st fatal case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the Maule region so far this year [2012]. The victim was on vacation in the "Potrero Grande" section, in the pre-mountain region of Curico, and was infected by the virus transmitted by the long-tailed [pygmy rice] rat.

The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of serious pneumonia on Tuesday [31 Jan 2012] in the Curico Hospital, where he died.

During the afternoon, the Public Health Institute confirmed the case as [a] hantavirus [infection] positive and is carrying out epidemiological surveillance in the focal area where the infection occurred. Also, they established a barrier and immediately made contact with close family members, who were evaluated, and so took samples from his wife in order to discard the presence of [a] hantavirus.

According to the epidemiological investigation, the patient worked as a businessperson in Santiago, visited the pre-mountain area during New Year, and later traveled every week to the same place to visit his family members. It seems he contracted the infection while gathering firewood in "Potrero Grande."

The date issued by the Department of Public Health of the Health SEREMI [regional governmental ministerial unit] indicates that during 2010, 11 hantavirus [infection] cases were registered in Maule, 3 of them with fatal outcomes, representing a 27 per cent [case] fatality rate, while in 2011, there were 6 cases, one of which was fatal.

The Health SEREMI, Hans Lungenstrass, visited and officially inspected the "Las Vertientes" and "El Peumo" campgrounds, both located in the "Potrero Grande" area, where the infection occurred, with the goal of conversing with the vacationers and providing them with bleach and material to avoid hantavirus [contact].

"Curico has a high index of hantavirus cases, which is why we estimate [that the infection occurred] here. Also, we insist that hantavirus [contact] can be avoided, taking into account some measures such as airing out cabins, spraying with bleach, keeping trash in closed containers, selecting areas that are clean and rodent-free, using closed tents with floors, keeping food in [rodent] resistant containers, among others," the official stressed.
