A strange disease is ravaging many tomato farms in Jigawa State, raising fears about scarcity and the resultant high cost of the produce. The disease causes the plants to turn brown, wilt and then dry up. [It] has persisted despite the application of pesticides and fertilizer, the farmers said. They have reported the case to agricultural experts, but the disease has defied all solutions.

[A farmer] said that for the past 10 years he was fortunate for only 2 seasons. Tomatoes lasted for 90 days, from planting to maturity, and [the crop] was usually attacked by the disease halfway into its growth. Once the weather changes, the plants began to wilt and the tomatoes became hard and changed colour.

On whether the farmers are unknowingly using contaminated seeds, he explained that farmers had the habit of procuring from certified government agencies; however, after buying from genuine sources they still battled with the disease: "70% of tomato farms in this year's [2019] dry season are affected by the disease. Only a handful of farmers were lucky to scale through," he added.

[A number of tomato diseases have been reported from the region, and many of them can also affect potatoes and other solanaceous crops. Drying out of tomato plants can be due to a number of fungal and bacterial wilt and root rot pathogens. Root rots lead to water stress on the plants, which would be enhanced during fruit ripening. Similar symptoms may also be due to late blight (_Phytophthora infestans_), which causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems and fruit in tomato and has been reported previously on potato in the country (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).

Effective control measures will need to be based on reliable diagnosis of the pathogen(s) involved.
