_Listeria_ bacteria that have been traced back to the M.V.Wool fish plant in Estonia have been contracted by 9 people in Estonia, 2 of whom died as a result.

Several countries' studies have suggested that a mutated and very aggressive form of the _Listeria_ bacteria is raging in an M.V.Wool fish plant located near Harku, just outside of Tallinn. According to the latest info, 26 people across Europe have already contracted the bacteria, 6 of whom have died -- among them 9 people in Estonia, 2 of whom have died, according to a longer story to air on ETV investigative program Pealtn√§gija on Wednesday night [25 Sep 2019].

Genetic analysis ordered by the Veterinary and Food Board (VTA) revealed that the aggressive and contagious ST1247 strain of _Listeria_ can be traced back to the factory owned by M.V.Wool, Estonia's largest fish producer. Bacteria from this specific strain have been found both in the plant's production building as well as from people that have fallen ill.

VTA deputy director general Olev Kalda said that the fish plant is under the watchful eye of inspectors, and each product batch to leave the plant is currently being thoroughly inspected. "Clearly some fairly innocuous _Listeria monocytogenes_ ended up at that business, possibly 3 or 4 years ago, but it's possible that as a result of insufficient [cleaning] measures, this mutation occurred there and it developed into a persister strain, that is, a strain unique only to that specific place," Kalda explained.

M.V.Wool factory owner and board chairman Mati Vetevool has categorically denied that the dangerous bacteria came from their factory, pointing the finger instead at Norwegian and Finnish farms from which he claims the bacteria ended up in their plant. "I absolutely do not agree that these bacteria are our bacteria," Vetevool said. "It comes in from the fish farm; it hasn't developed here. We can also end up stuck with a strain originating from a fish farm. Every night, our fish plant is thoroughly washed, and we destroy absolutely all bacteria in the cleaning process. It's not possible that we are poisoning anyone. Nothing of the sort is possible -- this is simply sheer libel."

According to Kalda, however, Vetevool's story doesn't add up. "The studies show that this specific strain has been found only in products to be produced by this company, it has been found in this company's environment -- that is, in its production facilities, on its production equipment -- but it, as I mentioned, did not enter this company in this form, with this current strain of DNA," the VTA official said.

Last year [2018], Estonia was hit by an unexpected _Listeria_ outbreak as a result of which 28 people fell ill; it claimed 7 lives. Taavi Riit, head of the Department of Molecular Analysis at the Veterinary and Food Laboratory (VTL), said that based on the latest analyses, some of these cases could be tied to the M.V.Wool specifically.

"Everyone certainly knows that DNA can be used to identify people, specifically in deaths, identify criminals, and identify genetic kinship between individuals," Riit said. "This exact principle applies to bacteria as well. We currently have no reason to doubt that this particular producer's products have caused this outbreak."

Listeriosis is a serious transmissible disease caused by the bacteria _L. monocytogenes_, which is especially dangerous to pregnant people, newborns, the elderly, and others with a compromised or weak immune system.

[The news report above concerns a multinational European _Listeria_ outbreak associated with contaminated smoked salmon produced by a processing facility in Estonia. When last posted by ProMED-mail in June 2019, there were a total of 22 cases since 2014: Denmark has 9 cases, Estonia 6, Finland 2, France 1, and Sweden 4. Now there are a total of 26 affected people across Europe, 6 of whom have died -- among them 9 people in Estonia, 2 of whom have died.

The outbreak _Listeria_ strain, ST1247 clonal complex 8, has been found both in the plant's production building as well as from affected people. The strain was also detected at wholesale and retail stores in France, Denmark, Italy, and Sweden from cold smoked or gravad salmon and from 6 batches of cold smoked trout products. Raw fish had been received from suppliers in Norway and Finland.

_Listeria monocytogenes_ is widely distributed in the environment where it can form biofilms, which enable the organism to attach to solid surfaces and become extremely difficult to remove, especially in parts of food-processing equipment that are difficult to access. In past listeriosis outbreaks, _Listeria_ contamination of food products occurred in parts of equipment "well beyond the [manufacturer's] recommended sanitation process" and was "found only after the devices were completely disassembled" (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/maple-leaf-eyes-meat-slicers-in-outbreak/article1060898/). Even if equipment used in food processing only adds a few organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated ready-to-eat food, because _L. monocytogenes_ can subsequently multiply at refrigerator temperatures to sufficient size to cause disease. - Mod.ML
