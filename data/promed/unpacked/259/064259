First Report of _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_, the Causal Organism of
Soybean Rust in the Province of Misiones, Argentina.

R. L. Rossi, Programa Soja, Nidera Semillas S.A., Ruta 8 km 376, C.P.
2600, Venado Tuerto, Santa Fe, Argentina. Plant Dis. 87:102, 2003;
published on-line as D-2002-1118-02N, 2002. Accepted for publication
8 Oct 2002.

In April 2002, _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ [Pr] Sydow was observed for
the first time in Leandro Alem, Province of Misiones, Argentina.
Misiones is nearly surrounded by Paraguay and Brazil, where it was
discovered recently (2) and where it causes serious disease (3).

Symptoms were observed on leaves in the upper half of plants at the
R6 stage in a soybean research field trial. Symptoms included
reddish-brown lesions on leaves especially on the abaxial surface,
and uredinia (spore-bearing structures) were observed in the lesions.
Leaf defoliation was observed due to the disease after the R5 stage,
and the environment (high humidity and air temperatures) was
particularly conducive to disease development.

The field trial area was 2500 square meters and included soybean
genotypes of maturity groups V to IX. Symptoms were detected in the
later maturity groups. Field trials were surrounded by kudzu
(_Pueraria_ sp.), a common weed introduced in South America as a
forage plant by Asian farmers. It was reported to be the main host of
Pr in Paraguay (2).

To confirm the identity of the pathogen, leaf samples from the middle
part of plants were collected and sent to the Foreign Disease-Weed
Science Research Unit, Ft. Detrick, MD, USA. Samples were analyzed
using a real-time PCR (1). Identification of Pr was confirmed in May,
2002 (R. Frederick, personal communication).

The soybean production area in Misiones is a small area in Argentina
lying 600 km northeast of the main soybean area in the north central
part of the country. SENASA (Servicio Nacional de Sanidad Vegetal
Nacional Service of Plant Health]) and SAGPYA (Secretary of
Agriculture) were formally informed about these results on 19 Jun
2002.

A program to assess the risk of disease spread is under development.

Soybean rust in South Africa

The first report of soybean rust caused by the fungus _Phakopsora
pachyrhyzi_ in the 2002/2003 season was announced on 30 Dec 2002 at
Cedara, an agricultural research station in KwaZulu-Natal Province.
It was found in an early-planted trial which is in early pod set. The
infection is still at a very early stage, with only a few lesions
visible on lower leaves.

Soybean rust was first identified in South Africa in late February
2001,when it was believed to have blown in from neighbouring
Zimbabwe. It reoccurred in 2002, with the first report on 4 Feb 2002.
This latest report is the third successive season in which the
disease has occurred and is now thought to be endemic in the area.
What is of considerable interest is how much earlier it has been
identified this season.

[Soybean rust, first reported in Hawaii in 1994, has been reported in
several areas (Australia, Brazil, China, India, Japan, central and
southern Africa, and Thailand). Yield losses of 10 to 90 percent have
been reported for some of these areas. There are 2 species,
_Phakopsora meibomiae_ and _P. pachyrhizi_, the latter being the more
aggressive pathogen. _P. pachyrhizi_ was reported in South America
for the first time in 2001, and again in 2002. Yield loss estimates
for Paraguay and Brazil range from 10 to 50 percent for 2002,
respectively, in some fields. This disease also has the potential to
cause significant losses in the United States. The fact that the
pathogen may be endemic in the region is cause for concern, since
spores can be spread by wind, causing the disease in other regions of
Africa.
