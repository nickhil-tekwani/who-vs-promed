The Trade Union of Workers and Municipal Employees (ASOEM by its Spanish initials) of Rio Grande [department, Tierra del Fuego province] has confirmed 2 new cases of brucellosis [by _Brucella canis_] in workers of the Rio Negro Municipality. The provincial Ministry of Labor has ordered the suspension of activities in the municipal dog pound [animal shelter].

ASOEM director Eduardo Cabral said: "Last week [week of 29 Oct 2012], we had confirmation of 2 new cases of brucellosis in municipal workers and are awaiting the results for other workers. We are talking of about 8 workers with brucellosis."

The Administration and Records Secretary noted that this is an incurable disease and complained that in 2010, the union had already asked the Ministry of Labor to close the shelter and make the necessary renovations to keep the animals and the workers separate. "There were no cases of brucellosis at that time."

Of note, the animal shelter remains closed by order from the Ministry of Labor after complaints from ASOEM.

[Domestic dogs can also be affected occasionally by _B. abortus_, _B. suis_, and _B. melitensis_, and it is not clearly stated that the isolates were formally identified as _B. canis_.

The following is reproduced from Brucellosis, human, canine - USA: (NY) B. canis 20120608.1160121:

_Brucella canis_ was initially recognized as an agent causing canine abortions by Carmichael in 1967 (1). Subsequently, human infections were diagnosed, primarily in laboratory workers as well as dog owners. It was subsequently clearly shown by a group from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1975 (2) that routine brucella agglutinin testing is not helpful for _B. canis_ infection in dogs or humans, and a more specific assay is now available (3).

The manifestations of _B. canis_ in humans can be minimal or can be an indolent bacteremia, as in this case. Complications of this infection can occur, including osteomyelitis, endocarditis, mycotic aneurysms, and granulomatous hepatitis (3).

[This disease in people is somewhat difficult to diagnose and is underreported. Urine from infected dogs is one of the main sources of infection to people.

In dogs, _B. canis_ is mainly transmitted by contact with the fetus and fetal membranes after abortions/stillbirths or by venereal transmission. This organism primarily enters the body by ingestion and through the genital, oronasal, and conjunctival mucosa, but transmission through broken skin may also be possible. In utero infections occur. Nursing puppies can be infected from milk, but the importance of this route is controversial. Other potential sources of infection include blood transfusions and contaminated syringes.

Dogs often become chronically infected with _B. canis_ and can shed this organism for prolonged periods. Although some dogs clear the infection after a year (generally with treatment), others remain bacteremic for 5 years and possibly longer.

_B. canis_ can also be spread on fomites. In conditions of high humidity, low temperatures, and no sunlight, _Brucella_ spp. can remain viable for several months in water, aborted fetuses, feces, equipment, and clothing. _Brucella_ species can withstand drying, particularly when organic material is present, and can survive in dust and soil. Survival is longer when the temperature is low, particularly when it is below freezing.

Humans usually become infected with _Brucella_ spp. by ingesting organisms or by the contamination of mucous membranes and abraded skin. Infection with _B. canis_ seems to require close contact with infected dogs or contact with bacterial cultures. _B. canis_ is zoonotic, but the virulence of this organism for humans may be low, although it may be higher than has been reported in the past. Under-reporting of this disease may skew the reporting statistics. Under-reporting may occur because the disease is difficult to diagnose, and many physicians do not have the disease on their zoonotic radar.

_B. canis_ infections in humans resemble brucellosis caused by other _Brucella_ species. Some people infected with _Brucella_ remain asymptomatic, which is one reason for the difficulty in diagnosis and the resulting subsequent under-reporting. In symptomatic cases, brucellosis is extremely variable, and the clinical signs may appear insidiously or abruptly. Typically, this disease begins as an acute febrile illness with nonspecific flu-like signs such as fever, headache, malaise, back pain, myalgia, and generalized aches. Drenching sweats can occur, particularly at night. Oral lesions were reported in a child concurrently infected with _B. canis_ and cytomegalovirus and resolved with antibiotic treatment for brucellosis. Another patient with a _B. canis_ infection had fever of unknown origin.

Some patients with brucellosis recover spontaneously, while others develop persistent symptoms that typically wax and wane. Occasionally seen complications include arthritis, spondylitis, chronic fatigue, and epididymo-orchitis. Neurologic signs (including personality changes, meningitis, uveitis, and optic neuritis), anemia, internal abscesses, nephritis, endocarditis, and dermatitis can also occur. Other organs and tissues can also be affected, resulting in a wide variety of syndromes. Treatment is with antibiotics; however, relapses can be seen months after the initial symptoms, even in successfully treated cases. The mortality rate is low; in untreated persons, estimates of the case fatality rate vary from less than 2 per cent to 5 per cent. Deaths are usually caused by endocarditis or meningitis.
