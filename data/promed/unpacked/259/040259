Legionnaires' disease is rapidly increasing in Australia, particularly in
Victoria, according to Australian Department of Health statistics.
There were 270 cases in 1998, 25% more than in any year since notification
began in 1991. Victorian cases more than doubled in 1997 and 1998, jumping
from 29 to 64 cases. About 10% of victims die soon after getting the
disease.
So far this year [1999 there has been a further 40% rise. By 7 July, 168
cases had been notified, more than for all of 1997. Nearly a third of all
cases, more than in any other state, have been in Victoria.
A spokesman for the Department of Human Services in Victoria said the 53
Victorian victims in 1999 included two small outbreaks at the Preston Club
in Bell Street, Preston, and Southcorp Packaging plant in Coburg. Public
health investigators have been unable to find a definite source in 48
cases, although more than one potential contaminated source has been found
in some cases.
Nearly all cases are caused by _Legionella_ bacteria suspended in tiny
droplets of water in air-conditioned air, although spas and potting mix
have also been linked to the disease. These droplets can spread up to 2 km
from their source.
Victoria's chief health officer, Dr Graham Rouch, says the increasing
number of cases in Victoria is due to better diagnosis and more
air-conditioning.
An Australian and international expert, Mr Clive Broadbent, who said the
disease was preventable with cleaning and proper design of air-cooling
systems, warned that there were 10 times more cases than suggested by
official figures. The Department of Human Services informs the public about
cases only when there is an outbreak, defined as more than one case linked
to a definite site. A spokesman for the department said the public was not
told of any of the 20 cases during April [1999, or about positive tests at
contaminated sites because "they were unrelated''. [But there is strong
medical evidence that single cases are likely to be part of small
unidentified outbreaks.
The water-treatment industry blames the rise on changed weather patterns,
ineffective cleaning chemicals, and a lack of registers or surveillance of
air-conditioning systems linked to poor industry compliance with cleaning
regulations.
