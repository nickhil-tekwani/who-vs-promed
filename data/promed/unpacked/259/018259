Grocery store misters could be the source of a legionnaires' disease outbreak in Wenatchee [Washington State]. It's the 1st in North Central Washington in 10 years.

To date, 4 people have come down with the respiratory infection. The only common link found so far is that they all shopped in the produce section at the Safeway on North Miller Street in the last 3 weeks. Testing is being done on produce misters to see if they are the source. Safeway officials shut down the misters [Fri 23 Oct 2015]. Health officials say the store has been cooperative.

People contract legionnaires' disease when they inhale tiny droplets contaminated with _Legionella_ bacteria. The fatality rate is between 5 and 30 percent depending on when you get treatment. Health officials are telling people to watch for symptoms of pneumonia, such as chest pains when coughing or chills. But officials say there's no reason to worry if you did visit the store. Most people who inhale or touch the bacteria do not get sick.

[Inhalation of _Legionella_ by susceptible individuals in the form of aerosols produced by _Legionella_-contaminated devices, such as cooling towers, evaporative condensers, whirlpool baths, showers, as well as grocery store ultrasonic misters, is a major mode of transmission for legionnaires' disease (1,2). Ultrasonic misters are said to produce smaller, more respirable droplets than other types of misters (1,2). However, the type of mister implicated in the Wenatchee, Washington outbreak is not stated in the news report above. Genotyping _Legionella_ isolates from patients and the misters would help implicate the grocery store misters as the source of the legionnaires' disease outbreak in Wenatchee, Washington. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.
