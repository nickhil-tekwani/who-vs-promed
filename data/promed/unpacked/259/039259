Dengue fever still on the rise in HCM [Ho Chi Minh] City
--------------------------------------------------------
The number of patients with dengue fever in HCM City is still on the
upward trend, according to the city's Preventive Medicine Centre. The
city has recorded 10 550 patients with dengue fever since the
beginning of this year [2011]. 10 cases have been fatal, compared to 2
during the same period last year [2010].

>From [3-9 Nov 2011], the number of dengue fever patients increased to
294. In the previous week, [27 Oct-2 Nov 2011], the number was 261.

In previous years, this is a time when the number of patients with the
disease decreased, but this year [2011] it was heading in the opposite
direction, Pham Viet Thanh, head of the HCM City Health Department,
told the Giao Duc (Education) newspaper.

Districts 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, Tan Binh, Binh Thanh, Thu Duc, and Binh
Chanh have all recorded a high number of patients with the disease
this year [2011].

Paediatric Hospital No. 1 has been admitting 60 children with dengue
fever each day on average for the last week, with two-thirds of the
children from the city.

Thanh said the department had set up 25 teams of inspectors to visit
all the districts and check on measures to prevent and control
outbreaks of fever dengue and the hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD).

The inspectors found that many companies, schools, and households had
not taken steps to have areas with mosquito larvae sprayed with
chemicals to kill them. Since the disease is transmitted by
mosquitoes, it is inevitable that the number of dengue fever patients
will rise.

Thanh said it was important that local authorities co-operate with
residents to destroy mosquito larvae.

His department continues to work with the Department of Education and
Training to try and control dengue fever outbreaks at schools,
especially kindergartens and primary schools.

The number of patients with the mosquito-borne disease has also been
increasing in other localities nationwide, including Ca Mau, Dong Nai,
Binh Duong, Binh Phuoc, Tay Ninh, Bac Lieu, Ha Noi, and Binh Thuan.

The National Hospital of Tropical Diseases has admitted 60 patients
with dengue fever in the 1st 2 weeks of November [2011], most of them
in Ha Noi.

As of [7 Nov 2011], 49 011 cases of dengue fever have been recorded
nationwide, with 46 deaths, according to the Preventive Medicine
Department under the Ministry of Health.

Viet Nam dengue fever toll rises to 46
--------------------------------------
Dengue fever has so far this year [2011] claimed 46 lives among 49 011
Vietnamese people who have been infected, according to the Viet Nam
Administration of Preventive Medicine.

Most of the dengue fever cases have been found in the central and
southern regions, the administration said.

It said the epidemic is under control because the number of infections
and fatalities has not increased compared to last year's [2010]
figures of 128 831 infections and 109 deaths.

However, people should be more aware of the disease and have
themselves examined at hospitals as soon as they develop a fever, it
added.

Many dengue fever patients have been admitted to the hospital with
high fever, viscera hemorrhage, or respiratory failure, which made it
very difficult or too late to cure, the administration said.

In Ho Chi Minh City, 10 deaths among 9832 infections had been reported
as of 31 Oct 2011. Local authorities said the districts with the
highest number of dengue fever cases are those having a lot of
abandoned fields, flooded areas, and construction sites, which offer a
convenient environment for mosquitoes to grow.

Viet Nam is one of 6 countries worst affected by dengue fever in Asia
Western Pacific with some 100 000 cases reported every year, according
to a report by the Ministry of Health.

Studies have found that it cost USD 41 to treat a mild case and USD
127 for a critical one in 2006, so the mosquito-borne disease has
become a burden on people with low incomes, the report says.

The sickness poses a high risk of death because vaccines and a
specific remedy are not yet available for the fever, according to the
ministry.

[Though the reported number of dengue cases in Viet Nam is lower than
that during the same period in 2010, new cases are being reported in
the southern and central provinces of Viet Nam.

According to the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific
(WHO/WPRO) report, available at
http://www.wpro.who.int/health_topics/dengue/, from 1 Jan to 31 Aug
2011, 38 684 cases and 32 deaths (CFR 0.08 percent) were reported. The
majority of cases (35 308) and deaths (31) are from southern Viet
Nam.

people in the 2 sub-districts were tested dengue fever [virus
infection] positive, and therefore the local health office continued
struggling to win the battle against that deadly disease.
