Around 15 500 hectares [ha; 1 hectare= 2.471 acres] of wheat fields have been infected with blast disease in 5 south western districts, said the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC) and the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE).

The infection [was] detected for the first time in the districts. [It] affected 9640 ha in Meherpur, 2563 ha in Chuadanga, 1500 ha in Jessore, 840 ha in Jhenidah, 320 ha in Kushtia and also 700 ha in [the] southern district Barisal, said DAE.

BADC and DAE have already burnt wheat plants on 875 ha of land in 4 government owned farms following instructions from the agricultural ministry.

A team of the Wheat Research Centre in Dinajpur visited several affected fields. After pathogen tests, the scientists confirmed the disease as wheat blast.

Spread of 'neck blast' disease in several districts has caused massive damage to paddy fields raising concern among farmers. Experts fear that the disease might cause up to 50 per cent yield loss in the districts where it spread. Paddy fields in many areas of Comilla, Chandpur, Gazipur, Tangail, Mymensingh, Sherpur, Jamalpur, Netrakona, Kisoreganj, Narsingdi, Munshiganj and Manikganj districts witnessed the disease. Farmers [said] that the 'neck blast' has started hitting rice fields at the mature stage of the crop from the beginning of last March [2016].

Dr M A Latif, Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) said most of the high-yielding and hybrid varieties are highly susceptible to this disease. Low temperature in night and high in day-time, prolonged wetness or dew in the morning, cloudy sky and drizzle lead to the disease outbreak. He said if favourable environment does not prevail, most of the cultivated varieties could be infected by 'neck blast'. Primary symptoms of 'neck blast' are very hard to diagnose. "Precautionary measures should be taken by the farmers to manage this disease," he said.

[Both wheat and rice blast are caused by the fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_ (synonym _Magnaporthe oryzae_). Although the pathogens are currently classified as the same species, the wheat blast fungus is a distinct population (referred to as _P. oryzae_ Triticum population) and does not cause disease in rice. Over 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related fungal strains, each of which generally appear to affect only a limited number of host species. Further work is needed regarding genotypic differentiation related to host range, including differences between the wheat and rice pathovars. Rice blast is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide. Wheat blast is now considered an emerging disease and a threat to global food security.

Blast symptoms on wheat (and barley) include bleaching of ears, shriveled kernels, and no seed production at all for severe infections. Yield losses seem to average 40 to 50 per cent, but cases of 100 per cent losses have also been reported, and wheat production in some affected areas has ceased.

Rice blast symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed. Depending on which plant parts are affected, the disease may manifest itself as leaf, collar, node or neck blast.

Humid and warm conditions favour disease development, but the life cycle of the fungus is still unknown. Spread of the rice pathogen occurs with infected plant material (including seed), mechanical means (including human and insect activity), water and wind. It is likely that the wheat pathogen is spread in similar ways. Disease management of rice blast may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. Available wheat cultivars lack resistance to wheat blast and only limited tolerance can be found. Resistance breeding is difficult because the fungus is highly variable, and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence.

Initially, wheat blast was thought to be caused by a fungal strain which crossed from rice to wheat, but it is now considered more likely to originate from local wild grasses (for example, ProMED-mail post 20120430.1117921). This would suggest that genetic events leading to a change in host range from grasses to wheat have previously occurred separately in different locations and, therefore, may potentially occur again in other regions. The emergence of wheat blast in Bangladesh represents its first report in southern Asia (ProMED-mail post 20160411.4150953). Sequencing studies will be required to clarify a possible origin of wheat blast strains in South Asia and their relationship to regional rice pathovars.
