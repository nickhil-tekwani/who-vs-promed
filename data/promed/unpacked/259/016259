A pet cockatiel purchased through a home-based aviary business in Brampton has tested positive for avian chlamydiosis, an infection that can cause avian chlamydiosis, an infection that can cause psittacosis in humans. There are no reported instances of human infection in connection with this case and the risk to the general public is low.

Peel Public Health advises anyone who may have recently purchased a bird from a home-based Brampton aviary, or through Kijiji, to take that bird, and any other pet birds that have been in contact with it, to a veterinarian to be tested for avian chlamydiosis. Birds carrying the bacteria that cause psittacosis in humans and avian chlamydiosis in birds may appear healthy but could still be shedding the bacteria. Infected birds should be treated with antibiotics to eliminate the infection.

Residents who have purchased a bird from a home-based aviary business or on Kijiji and are now experiencing fever, muscle aches and a dry cough are advised to see their family doctor. If diagnosed, psittacosis is highly treatable with antibiotics.

For more information about psittacosis, visit the CDC's website.

[This article states, 'avian chlamydiosis, an infection that can cause psittacosis in humans". Clearly this puts the human caretakers at risk of acquiring avian chlamydiosis also known as psittacosis in humans, which is a zoonotic disease. Generally people are exposed through air - or dust-borne organisms when cleaning the cages of infected pet birds or processing a flock. The birds shed the organism from their digestive or respiratory tracts. In people the disease usually has a respiratory characterization and progresses to flu-like symptoms. It may produce pneumonia, organ failure, and death if left untreated. If you have purchased or acquired a pet from one of the sources named in this article, then please be cautious and have your pet tested. - Mod.TG
