----------------------------------------------------------------------
I would like to reply to the Buruli ulcer report: It would be interesting to know if any of these cases have been confirmed by PCR. Although Buruli ulcer has been reported from Liberia, this disease does not usually occur as "outbreaks" because there is no person-to-person spread. It is possible that surveillance for Ebola is uncovering cases of Buruli ulcer, but it would be useful to know what diagnostic criteria have been used for this report.

I have worked on Buruli ulcer in West Africa for over 10 years. If true, it will be important to gain the help of WHO for getting appropriate antibiotics and protocols.

[As Dr Small notes, although the exact mode of transmission of _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ is still unknown, it is believed that it is not transmitted from person to person.

The diagnosis of Buruli ulcer can be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which has the highest sensitivity and turn-around time, direct microscopy, histopathology, or culture. However, the diagnosis in the cases in Liberia could have been made clinically, without laboratory confirmation, which may have lead to confusion with other diagnoses.

The news report at the source URL http://allafrica.com/stories/201410221008.html did not disclose how the diagnoses were made, and a search on the Internet for more information on the current cases in Bong County, Liberia failed to reveal additional information in this regard. More information from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.ML
