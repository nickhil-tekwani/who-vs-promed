[1] Air conditioning and possible impact on transmission
Date: Tue 7 Jul 2020
Source: North State Journal [abridged, edited]
https://nsjonline.com/article/2020/07/airborne-transmission-of-covid-19-a-possible-cause-of-increased-cases/


Edward Nardell, professor of medicine and of global health and social medicine at Harvard Medical School and professor of environmental health and of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard School of Public Health, said air conditioning use across the southern USA may be a factor in rising COVID-19 cases. Nardell said hot summer temperatures can create situations similar to those in winter, when respiratory ailments tend to surge, driving people indoors to breathe -- and rebreathe --air that typically is little refreshed from outside.

"The states that, in June, are already using a lot of air conditioning because of high temperatures are also the places where there's been greater increases in spread of COVID-19, suggesting more time indoors as temperatures rise," Nardell said in an interview with The Harvard Gazette. "The same [thing] happens in wintertime, with more time indoors." Airborne transmission, Nardell says, would make people even more vulnerable to the virus in a closed room. Nardell said in an office occupied by 5 people, with windows closed and air conditioners turned on, CO2 levels rise and occupants are rebreathing air in the room from each other.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a research letter in July [2020], saying an outbreak in late January [2020] and early February [2020] affected 10 people from 3 families who had eaten at the same air-conditioned restaurant in Guangzhou, China.

Nardell said germicidal lamps, which were proven effective in protecting against tuberculosis infection, have already been used to combat COVID-19. "Where [the lights] should be considered in the upcoming resurgence...would be, obviously, in a healthcare setting, but also in public buildings such as stores, restaurants, banks, and schools," Nardell said. "We need to know where transmission is occurring to know where they should go." Nardell cautioned, however, that the lights cannot be used in close-contact settings such as nursing homes.

[The article published in the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal is Lu J, Gu J, Li K, et al. COVID-19 outbreak associated with air conditioning in restaurant, Guangzhou, China, 2020. Emerg Infect Dis. 2020; 26(7): 1628-31. https://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2607.200764

Abstract: "During [26 Jan 2020-10 Feb 2020], an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in an air-conditioned restaurant in Guangzhou, China, involved 3 family clusters. The airflow direction was consistent with droplet transmission. To prevent the spread of the virus in restaurants, we recommend increasing the distance between tables and improving ventilation."

In the Discussion section, the authors concluded droplet transmission was the most likely route, although they mention that the transmission cannot be explained by large droplets alone. They suggest that the airflow from the air conditioner could have propelled small aerosolized droplets (defined as smaller than 5 micrometers).

At the risk of backlash for the following statement, one can speculate fairly safely that droplets can be aerosolized under certain conditions and may result in events that include aerosolized transmission (the most obvious of such events involve the use of nebulizers in the treatment of presumed bronchospasm, but as speculated in the above article, air conditioning and airflow currents may create some aerosolized material from the original droplets released). These "episodes" of limited aerosolized transmission may explain some of the superspreading events that have been identified during the course of epidemiologic investigations. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Selected countries
[A] China: National Health Commission, 83 644 total cases, 4634 deaths
[B] South Korea: 13 711 confirmed cases, 294 deaths
[C] Italy: 243 967 total cases, 35 028 deaths
[D] Iran: 269 440 total cases, 13 791 deaths
[E] USA: 3 770 012 total cases, 142 064 deaths

[These countries have been selected based on having had significant surges with SARS-CoV-2 infections, but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have impacted. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly with major resurgences. - Mod.MPP]

[There were 22 new confirmed cases in the past 24 hours -- 6 were imported and 16 were locally acquired in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. While it is now 12 days with no new cases reported from Beijing, it appears another cluster is underway in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. According to another media report, the area will do massive testing. Also, 6 of the reported infections have symptoms and 11 are currently asymptomatic (there was 1 case confirmed yesterday according to the national Health Commission report for 16 Jul 2020; https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1194880.shtml).

There were 14 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals (5 imported) and no new conversions from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. Since 18 May 2020, China has reported 37 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic infection.

Hong Kong reported 58 new cases. The newly reported cases involve 24 males and 34 females aged between 6 and 92 years. Among them, 8 had travel history during the incubation period. One of the newly confirmed cases came from a residential care home for the elderly, and 2 additional cases were staff from the facility (https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202007/17/P2020071700861.htm). Travel locations included India (2), Pakistan (2), Philippines (2), Ethiopia (1), and Malaysia (1). Details on the epidemiologic investigations are available at https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202007/17/P2020071700861_346027_1_1594995150847.pdf.

Takeaway message: China continues to have importations of infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2. Hong Kong is dealing with increased local transmission associated with the lifting of restrictions; new severe restrictions have been announced.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 39 cases with 1 new death, compared with 60 cases and 2 new deaths in the previous day (16 Jul 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 95 consecutive days. There were 11 locally transmitted cases: Seoul (6), Gyeonggi (2), Incheon (1), Ulsan (1) and Jeju (1); and 28 imported cases: airport quarantine (12), Gyeonggi (8), Dae-gu (3), Gyeongnam (2), Busan (1), Incheon (1), and Jeonnam (1). There were 8 provinces reporting no newly confirmed cases (compared with 11 provinces yesterday, 16 Jul 2020).

Detailed updates on the 60 cases reported yesterday (16 Jul 2020) including information on clusters can be found in notices 439 and 440, and updated analyses including the 39 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours can be found in notice 441 at https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030.

The overall impression hasn't changed. Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. However, that being said, importations are also playing a major role in the country as well. With the increase in cases, in the past few days there have been increases in reported deaths.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is up by +233 cases and +11 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (16 Jul 2020) 24-hour change was +230 cases and +20 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases increased slightly, but cases in intensive care units are still in a slow decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, the main provinces at the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at the link on the source URL to "download the latest data"). The provinces reporting the largest numbers of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period are Lombardy (55), Veneto (55) and Emilia-Romagna (54); Lazio (14) and Campania (12) are the other provinces reporting 10 or more cases. A total of 16 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (5 provinces reported no new cases). Italy is now 72 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 56 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. For more detailed information on the outbreak, I suggest going to the source URL above.

Interpretation: So far so good, but there are periodic signs of localized increased transmission.... Time will tell.

Speaking at a press conference on Friday [17 Jul 2020], Sima Sadat Lari said the total number of people tested positive for COVID-19 in Iran has risen to 269 440 following the detection of 2379 new cases since yesterday [16 Jul 2020].

Of the new cases detected over the past 24 hours, 1852 patients have been admitted to the hospital, she added. At least 232 873 patients have recovered from the coronavirus infection so far or have been discharged from hospitals across Iran, the spokeswoman said. She further put the death toll from COVID-19 in Iran at 13 791, saying the disease has taken the lives of 183 patients over the past 24 hours.

Among those undergoing treatment in medical centers at present, 3509 coronavirus patients have critical health conditions because of more severe infection, Lari noted. The spokeswoman also said more than 2 098 000 coronavirus diagnostic tests have been carried out in Iran so far.

[The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 3 770 012 including 142 064 deaths, an increase from 3 695 025 cases and 141 118 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 217 562 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 17 Jul 2020 (+332 since 16 Jul 2020) including 18 758 (+4 since 16 Jul 2020) confirmed deaths and an additional 4619 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Florida, California, Texas, Arizona, Georgia, Tennessee, Louisiana, North Carolina, Alabama, and South Carolina -- the same 10 states as yesterday (16 Jul 2020), slightly rearranged. Note that 6 of the 10 states are located in the south east region of the country. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All of the top 10 states reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 1977 to 11 466. In terms of cumulative case reports, the order is unchanged from previous days with New York as number one, followed by California, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, Illinois, Arizona, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania. A total of 45 states and entities now have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours, the proportion increase of newly confirmed cases was 2.0%. The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 19.2% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country but gradually slowing down, but may reflect a change in reporting in the USA that began on Monday 13 Jul 2020.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, which are definitely worth reviewing, as a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, as of 17 Jul 2020, the percentage of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay remains at 9% out of 47 313 367 tests performed, consistent with the ongoing, not-yet-under-control pandemic in the country (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html).

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 17 Jul 2020.

Highlights
----------
- WHO director-general Dr Tedros joined the leaders of Spain to pay tribute to those who lost their lives to COVID-19, and stated that "Spain has shown that with political leadership and action, backed by community support, COVID-19 can be controlled, no matter at what stage virus transmission is at in a country".

- The WHO regional director for the Western Pacific, Dr Takeshi Kasai, praised New Zealand's success in controlling COVID-19, adding that it has been a concerted effort to limit and stop COVID-19 on their shores and support other countries in the Region.

- The Pan American Health Organization/WHO Regional Office for the Americas and the Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin (COICA) have agreed to work together to step up the fight against COVID-19 in indigenous areas of the Amazon. PAHO and COICA called for the urgent implementation of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic that are "appropriate to the various geographical and cultural contexts and that include the participation of the communities themselves".

- As of [10 Jul 2020], 192 countries, territories and areas have implemented additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic. An updated summary is outlined in the "Subject in Focus" below.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 58.0% of the global newly reported cases and 62.5% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 7 million cases. The USA reported 48.7% (67 165) of the newly confirmed cases in the region, and Brazil reported 28.5% (39 924), Mexico 4.5% (6149), Colombia 3.8% (5271), Peru 2.8% (3857), Argentina 3.1% (4250), and Chile 1.8% (2493).

- The European region reported 9.1% of the global newly reported cases and 8.4% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 29.5% (6406) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Israel 8.7% (1896), Kazakhstan 7.9% (1707), Spain 6.3% (1361), Turkey 4.3% (933), Ukraine 3.7% (809), Romania 3.6% (777), the UK 3.0% (641), Kyrgyzstan 2.8% (603), Germany 2.7% (583), Azerbaijan 2.3% (493), Armenia 2.0% (442), and Uzbekistan 2.6% (562).

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.3% of the global newly reported cases and 8.9% of global newly reported fatalities. Saudi Arabia reported 18.3% (2764) of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 16.6% (2500), Pakistan 13.8% (2085), Iraq 15.1% (2281), Oman 8.8% (1327), Egypt 6.2% (928), Kuwait 5.2% (791), Bahrain 3.5% (524), and Qatar 3.3% (494).

- The African region reported 8.3% of the global newly reported cases and 5.5% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 66.8% (13 172) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Equatorial Guinea 6.6% (1307), Ghana 3.5% (695), Nigeria 3.0% (595), Algeria 3.0% (585), and Kenya 2.1% (421).

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.6% of the global newly reported cases and 0.58% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 65.1% (2416) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 15.7% (583), Australia 8.5% (315), Singapore 6.7% (248), China 2.1% (78), and South Korea 1.6% (60).

- The South East Asia region reported 16.6% of the global newly reported cases and 14.1% of global deaths. India reported 88.5% (34 956) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 6.9% (2733) and Indonesia 4.0% (1574).

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis, followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily caseload of all of the regions. The progression has been the initial "surge" in the Western Pacific region, followed by the surge in the European region and its decline, the entry and surging of the Americas region without any decrease, and the gradual and persistent increase in the South East Asia region, the increase then plateauing of the Eastern Mediterranean region, and the slow but steady increase in the Africa region and a slight increase in the Western Pacific region today.

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 14 189 018, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. As predicted yesterday (16 Jul 2020) the reported cumulative case count did pass 14 million cases, taking 5 days since it crossed the 13 million case mark. The global case count rose by 1.7% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts, although India crossed the 1 million case mark yesterday (16 Jul 2020). In the past 24 hours, the USA reported the most newly confirmed cases (74 987) followed by India (34 820) and Brazil (33 959). The total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, India, Russia, and Peru) represent over half of the total cases reported globally (56.1%). A global total of 599 339 deaths have been reported, an increase of 6666 deaths in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by India, Brazil, South Africa, Colombia, Mexico, Russia, Argentina, Peru, and Bangladesh. These 10 countries are the same as 2 days ago, just slight variances in order (15 Jul 2020). All these countries are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 3034 to 74 987. The number of daily newly confirmed cases is climbing rapidly in the USA. Also worthy of note is that 6 of the top 10 countries for daily reported newly confirmed cases are from the Americas region, consistent with the continued dominance of SARS-CoV-2 activity in this region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 9.0%, again consistent with the ongoing pandemic but slowing down in terms of daily growth.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts. That being said, the most severely affected region is the Americas with cases increasing on a daily basis, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.MPP]
