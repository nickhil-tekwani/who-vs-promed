The number of people infected in the outbreak of salmonellosis after eating at a Fayetteville, North Carolina hotel has grown to 99, county health officials said on Wed 29 May 2013. At least 5 people were hospitalized.

The hotel has 2 restaurants -- All American Sports Bar and Grill and The Cafe Bordeaux -- as well as a banquet kitchen.

Holiday Inn Bordeaux CEO Scooter Deal said the health department's investigation remains active, but the hotel has been cleared to continue doing business. He said employees are getting additional training in proper food handling techniques with some help from the health department. More than a dozen hotel employees were among the infected.

Health department officials said Wednesday [29 May 2013] that they are still investigating the source of the contamination. Cumberland County health director Buck Wilson said "control measures put in place to prevent further spread of the illness appear to be working."
