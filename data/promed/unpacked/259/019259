Seven people were hospitalized with suspected anthrax in Aksy district of Jalal-Abad region of Kyrgyzstan. Most of them are men, but there are also women and school-age children, the head of the Department of the Republican Center for Quarantine and Especially Dangerous Infections, Kubanychbek Bekturdiev, told 24.kg News Agency.

According to him, patients have characteristic anthrax carbuncles on the bodies. One of them tested positive, while the rest of the tests are not yet ready.

According to the Ministry of Health, 6 people are still receiving treatment at the general medical practice center. The condition of one of them is of moderate severity; the rest are in satisfactory condition.

"Our specialist, together with the veterinary service, left for the outbreak area. There are about 35 contact persons, but their number can be much higher. They take antibiotics for prevention. The meat was distributed among several families, and more than 50 people ate it. Household visits are made to identify contact persons, and sanitary and awareness-raising work is being carried out among the population. An extraordinary meeting of the regional emergency anti-epidemic commission was also held. The place where the sick cow was slaughtered has been concreted, it was registered," Kubanychbek Bekturdiev informed.

"A few days ago, our specialists witnessed [the] death of another cow, most likely from anthrax. The burial place was also concreted," he added.

[For a description of the Jalal-Abad region, read more at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalal-Abad_Region: "Wheat, fruit, vegetables, maize, nuts, tobacco, and silk-worm cocoons are grown in the region. The region also has a few textile plants and hydroelectric stations. Minerals, natural gas, coal, metals, and oil can be found here, notably around the town of Kochkor-Ata, which is home to small-scale oil industry. Most of the extraction of minerals, natural gas, coal, metals, and oil of the Soviet era has ceased.... Except for the small fringes of the Fergana Valley, Jalal-Abad region is a land of mountains." Aksy is a raion (district) of Jalal-Abad region in western Kyrgyzstan. For a map and description, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aksy_District.

From the very brief description, this was a typical outbreak arising from the butchering of an animal dying of anthrax and the meat given to neighbours' families. It is very fortunate that there were no fatal gastroenteric cases of anthrax, only cutaneous cases from handling the meat. The authorities appear to be on top of it by capping the cattle graves (2) with concrete. The district abuts the Fergana valley of Uzbekistan, which has a long history of livestock anthrax. Being at constant risk, it is a pity that the Kyrgyz districts bordering Fergana do not routinely vaccinate their cattle, but as outbreaks can be sporadic, the reluctance of the cattle owners is understandable. - Mod.MHJ
