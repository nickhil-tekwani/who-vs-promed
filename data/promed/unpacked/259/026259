SHIGELLA DYSENTERY SURVEYS: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
===================================================
From: Nicol Coetzee <nc@anat.uct.ac.za>

We are setting up a surveillance system for _Shigella dysenteriae_ type 1 in
Cape Town, South Africa. Currently, laboratory reports are being collated,
but there are many gaps. It seems as though there may be many more than the
approximately 40 cases reported over the last four months.
We would like to get more detailed risk factor information by doing home
visits and interviewing cases identified from laboratory reports. Does
anyone have a interview schedule (questionnaire) that has been used in the
field, for the investigation of outbreaks of shigellosis?
It would save us lots of time if such an instrument is available, and has
already been field tested.
