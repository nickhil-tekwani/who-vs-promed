Indonesia: 2 children hospitalized as suspected avian influenza cases
---------------------------------------------------------------------
2 children have been admitted to hospital in Indonesia with suspected avian
influenza, and a zoo in Jakarta has been closed after tests showed some
exotic birds had the virus, the health minister said on Mon 19 Sep 2005.
The highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of the virus has killed 4 Indonesians,
including one woman who died in Jakarta a week ago. [The WHO recognizes
only 2 of these 4 cases as unequivocally confirmed avian influenza cases. -
Mod.CP]. The virus has killed 64 [58 according to WHO as of 16 Sep 2005 -
Mod.CP] people in 4 Asian countries since late 2003 and has also spread to
Russia and Europe [that is, European Russia - Mod.CP].
"Until now, 3 children are being treated in a hospital ... 2 are suspected
of having the symptoms of bird flu based on the lab tests. The other one is
still under observation," minister Siti Fadilah Sapari told the local El
Shinta radio. Indonesia sends blood tests from all suspected bird flu cases
to Hong Kong for confirmation.
Sapari said officials had also found traces of bird flu in a number of
exotic birds at Jakarta's Ragunan zoo, which lies in the south of the
teeming capital. "For the time being, the (Jakarta) regional office has
decided to close down Ragunan for 21 days," Sapari said. The Jakarta Post
newspaper quoted Agriculture Minister Anton Apriantono as saying that 19
birds in the zoo had the virus. Over the weekend [17-18 Sep 2005], tens of
thousands of people visited the zoo, which is popular with low-income
Indonesians. The government would kill those birds at the zoo which had
tested positive for the virus, Sapari said.
Health officials last week [3rd week September 2005] said that bird flu had
killed a 37 year old woman who lived near a chicken farm in south Jakarta
and that another person who had close contact with her was also suspected
of having the virus.
The World Health Organization said last week [3rd week September 2005] that
bird flu was moving toward becoming transmissible by humans and that the
international community had no time to waste to prevent a pandemic. Most of
the people killed in Asia since 2003 caught the virus from infected birds.
Health experts say the greatest worry is that H5N1 could mutate and become
transmissible between people. Besides Indonesia, bird flu has killed 44
people in Viet Nam, 12 people in Thailand and 4 in Cambodia.

[Recent reports are ambiguous, but there seem to be 2 children in the
hospital with provisional confirmation of avian influenza virus infection
and 2 other suspected but unconfirmed cases: a child and a neighbor of the
most recently deceased confirmed case of avian influenza virus infection.
There is a continuing disparity between the number of human cases of avian
influenza cited by the Indonesia authorities and the number identified by
WHO as laboratory confirmed cases. As of Fri 16 Sep 2005, the WHO-confirmed
figures for laboratory confirmed human cases of avian influenza in East
Asia since 26 Dec 2003 are the following: Cambodia 4 cases and 4 deaths,
Indonesia 2 cases and 2 deaths, Thailand 17 cases and 12 deaths, Viet Nam
90 cases and 40 deaths; giving overall totals for the whole area of 113
cases and 58 deaths.
