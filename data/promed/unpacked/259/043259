Drug-resistant salmonella:
A strain of salmonella that killed 10 persons in Britain in 1994 and has
proved resistant to common antibiotics has reached the United States.
Salmonella typhimurium DT104, discovered in the United Kingdom in 1984,
caused an outbreak among 19 children in Nebraska in October, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. It is the first U.S. outbreak
linked to that strain, according to the CDC, which is trying to pinpoint the
source. The CDC found that this strain is resistant to ampicillin and
tetracycline, which are commonly used to treat salmonellosis. The drugs
trimethoprim and fluoroquinolones are being used to treat these infections
in Britain, but the bacteria are becoming resistant to them as well. The
strain is the second most common type of salmonella in the United Kingdom.
