On Sat 10 Oct 2020, a search was applied in the ASF core zone in Markisch-Oderland by municipality personnel, hunters, farmers, police officers, fire fighters, and the technical relief organization. In the Oderbruch, drones with thermal imaging cameras were also used.

A drone discovered a pack of wild boars on the Oder island in Kustrin-Kietz, reports the Markische Oderzeitung (MOZ) in its online edition. As can be seen on the drone's camera images, there are a total of around 17 dead and 30 living animals, some of which are diseased. The apparently infected boars should now continue to be observed by drone, but, if possible, not roused, according to the MOZ report. "Intervening would be too dangerous because sick animals are very aggressive," explained Thomas Behrendt, the district's spokesman, to the news portal rbb 24.

According to reports from various regional media, there were also carcass finds in other locations in the searched core zone, which are now being examined for the virus. The results are expected early next week. By Fri 9 Oct 2020, 2 ASF cases in wild boars had been detected in the Markisch-Oderland district. The domestic pig herds are still ASF-free.

[The ASF event in the district Markisch-Oderland (Brandenburg) started on 29 Sep 2020 near the hamlet of Bleyen, about 2 km [1.24 mi] from the border with Poland, where a young boar (less than one year old) was shot in a corn field. Post-mortem examination showed pathology of organs indicative for ASF, which was confirmed by PCR.

The low Ct values indicated a high virus load. This location is more than 50 km [31.1 mi] north of Germany's 1st cluster of ASF-infected wild boar, in Brandenburg's districts Oder-Spree and Spree-Neisse; that outbreak started on 7 Sep 2020, when a carcass of a (largely decomposed) female wild boar was found in a field of harvested crops and found ASF-infected; at present, the cluster counts more than 50 confirmed cases, including animals that are estimated to have died 2 months ago.

The location of the cluster in Markisch-Oderland is notable in that there have not been any reports of infected wild boar on the other side of the border in Poland at this latitude. The geographic situation of both clusters is presented in OIE's interactive ASF outbreak map (global) at https://tinyurl.com/yy49z8p7 (click to center on the German/Polish cluster; zoom repeatedly until separate orange triangles, each presenting a case, become visible in the southern cluster). The absence of reported cases (meaning, "no information") on the Polish territory facing the Markisch-Oderland cluster becomes apparent, indicative of the need for surveillance and updated reporting from Poland.

It has become evident, also shown in video clips presented by German TV, that wild boar are able to swim and cross the river Oder from Poland and to penetrate the electrical fences erected on German soil (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CE0AZvkrXA&feature=youtu.be; thanks to Sabine Zentis).
