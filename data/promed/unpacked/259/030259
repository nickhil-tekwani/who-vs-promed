Influenza update no 201
-----------------------
Summary
-------
- In North America the influenza season has started. The predominant subtype of influenza viruses detected was influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.
- For the rest of the northern hemisphere as well as in the southern hemisphere influenza activity remained low.
- In countries of tropical areas variable influenza activity was reported.
- Based on FluNet reporting (as of 19 Dec 2013, 07:15 UTC), during weeks 48 to 49 (24 Nov 2013 to 7 Dec 2013), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 89 countries, areas or territories reported influenza surveillance data. The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 42 360 specimens. 3304 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 2816 (85.3 percent) were typed as seasonal influenza A and 487 (14.7 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed seasonal influenza A viruses, 1166 (66.4 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 591 (33.6 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 39 (70.9 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 16 (29.1 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.
- For updates on human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus see the WHO website (http://www.who.int/csr/don/en/ and http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza).

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America
-------------
Overall influenza activity in North America has increased indicating the start of the season, with A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominant. In Canada influenza-like illness (ILI) and detections of influenza has increased. In the United States of America, the proportion of visits for influenza-like illness reached the 2 percent national threshold for the start of the season and the number of samples testing positive for influenza increased to 17 percent.

Europe
------
Low levels of influenza activity continued. All 3 influenza subtypes were detected but in low numbers. The number of hospitalizations due to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) remained at interseasonal level.

Northern Africa and the Western and Central Asia region
-------------------------------------------------------
Influenza activity was low in the northern African and western and central Asia. Egypt and Jordan reported increased circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.

Northern Asia
-------------
Influenza activity in the northern region of Asia remained low. In northern China, influenza detections continued to increase but stayed at interseasonal level. In Mongolia, clinical respiratory illness activity has increased since mid-August [2013] though with no influenza viruses detected.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall influenza activity in the Caribbean, Central America, and tropical areas of South America was at low levels. Generally influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 circulated throughout. In Honduras although ILI activity and SARI-associated hospitalizations decreased, the proportion of SARI-associated deaths increased and of 209 samples tested during weeks 42 to 45, 30.1 percent were positive for influenza.

Central African tropical region
-------------------------------
In the African tropical region, influenza activity was reported from the central and western regions. In Cameroon 29 percent of the samples were positive for influenza with mainly influenza B. Cameroon also reported a high number of SARI cases in recent weeks. Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana reported increased detections of A(H3N2). Madagascar reported increased ILI activity associated with non-influenza respiratory viruses.

Tropical Asia
-------------
Influenza activity in southern Asia was generally low but increased in some areas. Influenza A(H3N2) virus was the main subtype reported, but A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses were also detected in low numbers. In southern China, influenza activity continued to increase. In the Islamic Republic of Iran influenza activity increased since mid-November [2013].

Influenza activity in South-East Asia varied among countries but overall remained at moderate levels with A(H3N2) virus predominant. Activity increased in the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Thailand, remained moderate in Viet Nam, and decreased slightly in Cambodia.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
In the southern hemisphere the influenza season is over and all indicators are at inter seasonal level.

[The northern hemisphere winter influenza epidemic is becoming established in some parts of North America, but is not yet apparent in the European region and most parts of Northern Asia. Influenza virus activity has largely declined throughout the southern hemisphere.

Initial results suggest that the influenza (H1N1)pdm09 (swine flu) strains may become the predominant strain in North America this winter [2013-2014]. The current H1N1 vaccine virus and the epidemic virus appear to be well matched antigenically and vaccination throughout North America is recommended. - Mod.CP]
