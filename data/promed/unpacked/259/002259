Summary
Between 2011 and 2013, 3 breeders of variegated squirrels (_Sciurus variegatoides_) had encephalitis with similar clinical signs and died 2 to 4 months after onset of the clinical symptoms. With the use of a metagenomic approach that incorporated next-generation sequencing and real-time reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), the presence of a previously unknown bornavirus was detected in a contact squirrel and in brain samples from the 3 patients. Phylogenetic analyses showed that this virus, tentatively named variegated squirrel 1 bornavirus (VSBV-1), forms a lineage separate from that of the known bornavirus species.

[A report in the 8 Jul 2015 issue of Live Science (http://m.livescience.com/51492-new-squirrel-virus-strain-suspected-in-deaths-of-3-in-germany.html) commented, "However, the new study does not definitively prove that this virus caused the encephalitis, the researchers noted. Still, until more research is done, 'feeding or direct contact with living or dead variegated squirrels should be avoided as a precautionary measure,' the European Centre for Disease Control said. Many questions remain, including where the virus naturally 'lives' and how it is transmitted. In addition, people with unexplained encephalitis could also be tested for the virus, the researchers said."

Borna disease is named after the town of Borna in Saxony, Germany, where an outbreak of equine encephalitis occurred in 1885, and was subsequently diagnosed in sheep and horses in Central Europe. The virus has been shown to persist in nervous system tissue of a wide range of species including horses, sheep, cattle, cats, dogs, ostriches and more recently, humans. Additional comments are provided by Mod.CP in archive no. 20080813.2510. Finding a bornavirus in squirrels is not surprising biologically.

The evidence for VSBV-1 as the etiological agent of the encephalitis cases appears fairly strong. If further substantiated, this is another example of a pathogen's species jumping. Results of further research are awaited with interest.
