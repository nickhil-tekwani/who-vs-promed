PRION DISEASE UPDATE 2007 (06)
******************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.promedmail.org>
ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases
<http://www.isid.org>
[Note: With continuing decline of the number of cases of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease [abbreviated previously as vCJD or CJD (new
var.) in ProMED-mail in the human population, it has been decided to
broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED-mail reports to include
other prion-related diseases. These updates supersede the previous
update thread.
The definitions of the designations deaths, definite cases, probable
vCJD cases, can be found by accessing the UK Department of Health
website (<http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/index.htm>) or by reference to a
previous ProMED-mail post in the vCJD thread.
Data on vCJD cases from any part of the world are now included in
these updates where appropriate, and other forms of CJD (sporadic,
iatrogenic, familial, and GSS -- Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker
disease) are included also when they have some relevance to the
incidence and etiology of vCJD.
In addition, prion-related diseases of domesticated and free-living
animals may also be included if relevant. - Mod.CP]

Monthly Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics - 2 Oct 2007
---------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is today [Mon 2 Oct 2007] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (CJD). This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease [abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the
form of the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy).
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK as of 28 Sep 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------
Summary of vCJD cases -- deaths
-------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 114
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 47
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 161
Summary of vCJD cases -- alive
------------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 5
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 166
N.B. Following this press notice the Department of Health will stop
issuing monthly CJD press notices because the same data are also
published by the National CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh. Up to
date figures for the number of vCJD cases in the UK can be found on
the website of the National CJD Surveillance Unit at
<http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/figures.htm>.
These data are still consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak
in the UK is in decline. The peak number of deaths was 28 in the year
2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in
2005, 5 in 2006, and so far 3 in 2007.
Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK since 1995
------------------------------------------------------
As of 28 Sep 2007, in the UK in the year 2007, so far there have been
82 referrals, 30 deaths from sporadic CJD, 2 deaths from iatrogenic
CJD, 2 deaths from familial CJD, one from GSS, and 3 deaths from vCJD.

[2] Canada: new prion protein
Date: Thu 16 Aug 2007
Source: Centre for Prions and Protein Folding Diseases, University of
Alberta public release [edited]
<http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-08/uoa-npp081507.php>

Scientists have discovered a new protein that may offer fresh
insights into brain function in mad cow disease. "Our team has
defined a 2nd prion protein called 'Shadoo', that exists in addition
to the well-known prion protein called 'PrP'," said Professor David
Westaway, director of the Centre for Prions and Protein Folding
Diseases at the University of Alberta.
"For decades we believed PrP was a unique nerve protein that folded
into an abnormal shape and caused prion disease: end of story. This
view is no longer accurate," Westaway adds.
The study was conducted jointly by the University of Toronto,
University of Alberta, Case Western Reserve University (Ohio), and
the McLaughlin Research Institute (Montana). The research is
published today [16 Aug 2007] in the EMBO (European Molecular Biology
Organization) Journal and represents a culmination of work initiated
at the University of Toronto in 1999, and then continued more
recently at the University of Alberta.
This is the 1st discovery since 1985 of a new brain prion protein. "A
2nd prion protein had been inferred by other research, based on
indirect studies and the examination of DNA sequences," said lead
author Joel Watts, a graduate student at the University of Toronto's
Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases. "But we not only
demonstrate that this theoretical protein really exists and shares
several properties with healthy PrP; we have also defined an
unexpected alteration in prion infections.
"As the PrP molecule alters shape and accumulates in a prion-affected
brain, the Shadoo protein seems to disappear," Watts added. Since
proteins in a living cell are the molecules "that do the work, this
is likely to be significant," he said.
"Many facets of a prion disease like BSE are puzzling," Westaway
said. "The puzzles include the cause of death of brain cells, the
function of normal prion proteins, and the rules governing emergence
and spread of prions from animal to animal. We believe the Shadoo
protein can give us a fresh purchase on these important questions."

Abstract
--------
The cellular prion protein, PrP/C, is neuroprotective in a number of
settings and in particular prevents cerebellar degeneration mediated
by CNS (central nervous system)-expressed Doppel or internally
deleted PrP ('delta PrP'). This paradigm has facilitated mapping of
activity determinants in PrP/C and implicated a cryptic PrP/C-like
protein ['pi']. Shadoo (Sho) is a hypothetical GPI
(glycosylphosphatidylinisotol)-anchored protein encoded by the _Sprn_
gene, exhibiting homology and domain organization similar to the
N-terminus of PrP. Here we demonstrate _Sprn_ expression and Sho
protein in the adult CNS. Sho expression overlaps PrP/C, but is low
in cerebellar granular neurons (CGNs) containing PrP/C and high in
PrP/C-deficient dendritic processes. In _Prnp_0/0 CGNs, Sho
transgenes were PrP/C-like in their ability to counteract neurotoxic
effects of either Doppel or delta-PrP. Additionally, prion-infected
mice exhibit a dramatic reduction in endogenous Sho protein. Sho is a
candidate for ['pi'], and since it engenders a PrP/C-like
neuroprotective activity, compromised neuroprotective activity
resulting from reduced levels may exacerbate damage in prion
infections. Sho may prove useful in deciphering several unresolved
facets of prion biology." - Mod.CP]

Taiwan CDC clarifies media report of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)
transmission through placenta extract injection
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 30 Aug 2007, a print medium in Taiwan reported that "Placenta
extracts could lead to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)" [see
ProMED-mail post "Prion disease update 2007 (05) 20070901.287"]. With
reference to this report, Taiwan CDC (Centers for Disease Control)
states that the Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Advisory Committee held a
meeting this March [2007] after a suspected CJD case was reported by
National Cheng-Kung University (NCKU) Hospital.
Based on the limited information provided by NCKU Hospital, the
patient's neurological characteristics and symptoms did not fully
meet the case definition of CJD. Hence, the committee has requested
the hospital to provide more detailed information about the patient
and has also scheduled another meeting to further investigate the case.
Another print medium has also reported that the same patient may have
used placenta extracts. However, an epidemiological investigation
conducted by the public health personnel indicated that the patient
has no record of administering placenta extract injection, which
suggests that the report may be incorrect. Further, Taiwan CDC also
adds that currently no incidences of CJD in humans that are caused by
injection of placenta extracts have been reported yet in the world.
CJD is a rare and incurable degenerative neurological disorder. It is
caused by the accumulation of prions in the nerve cells, which
results in spongiform and many neurological symptoms. The traditional
form of CJD is spontaneous and may be inherited from one's parents.
On average, it affects people aged around 65. Although cases of
human-to-human transmission have been reported, they were either
caused by organ transplants or by blood transfusions. Thus far, no
reports of CJD transmission between humans have been associated with
body contact. On the other hand, another variant of CJD is called
vCJD, which may be related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
The common name for BSE is mad cow disease. Approximately 200 cases
of vCJD have been reported worldwide, mainly in Western Europe,
including England, France, and Ireland. Since 1990, Taiwan has banned
imports of live cattle (sheep) as well as their by-products that may
contain living tissues such as meat and bone meal, meat meal, bone
meal, blood meal, feeding oil, embryos, cosmetic products containing
bovine or sheep tissues such as placenta extracts, and serums. In
Taiwan, CJD patients and people who visited Western Europe during a
specific time period are prohibited from donating blood.
Since 1997, the health authorities in Taiwan have been monitoring
CJD. Until August 2007, 180 cases have been reported and confirmed in
Taiwan. Over the decade, the yearly average incidence of CJD in
Taiwan is 0.5-1 cases per million population, which is the same as
the world average. Experts in this domain have also confirmed that
all confirmed cases in Taiwan are traditional CJD and no cases of
vCJD have been observed in Taiwan. Nevertheless, Taiwan CDC will
continue to monitor the occurrence of this disease to ensure the
health of people in Taiwan.
For more information on CJD and the related preventive measures,
please visit <http://www.cdc.gov.tw/en/> or dial the toll-free
consultation hotline 1922 operated by Taiwan CDC. The information
provided by Taiwan CDC can prevent the transmission of CJD and avoid
unnecessary panic due to lack of knowledge about the disease.
