Bulgaria has introduced a ban on exports of live poultry and poultry
products to the European Union as a preventive measure against the
spread of the Newcastle disease [NCD] that was detected earlier this
month [July 2006] in a southern area.
The order was issued by the veterinary medical service head, Zheko
Bajchev. It will be in force until the European Commission delivers
its verdict on exports of poultry products from the village of
Slunchogled, the region of Kurdzhali, where the infection is believed
to be a combination of Newcastle disease and bird flu [see comments].
The decision of the European Commission is expected on 15 Aug 2006.
The village of Slanchogled, whose population are predominantly ethnic
Turks, is quarantined for a period of 21 days in an attempt to
prevent the spread of the virus.
Preliminary tests show the virus may prove different from the
deadly-to-humans H5N1 strain.
Samples have been sent to the European Union's reference laboratory
for avian flu in Weybridge, near London, for further tests to
determine the bird flu strain.

[An official notification on the above NCD outbreak, including a map,
has been sent today (27 Jul 2006) to the OIE; see
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_08.HTM#Sec14>.
Two outbreaks of NCD have been reported to the OIE earlier in 2006
(January and April), in 2 separate locations.
The current OIE report provides the following data: date of start of
the outbreak -- 11 Jul 2006; susceptible animals -- 1526; dead -- 86;
destroyed -- 1440.
Suspected H5N1 infection with avian influenza virus, in the same
premises, has been published last week by the media; later newswires
played down the identity of the virus as H5N1 (see ref.). Though --
in view of the relatively low mortality (see above) -- apparently,
HPAI does not seem to be involved, its exclusion depends upon the
laboratory results, both from the local as well as from the reference
laboratory. - Mod.AS]
