I saw several news reports regarding this "mutant" pertussis strain that
suggested the putative mutation was in the pertactin gene. I don't believe
there is any convincing data that indicates immune response to any specific
protein is necessary and/or sufficient for complete protection. If that
was well understood it certainly would be questionable to proceed with the
trials of monocomponent acellular pertussis vaccines that don't involve
pertactin (I understand that there are several such vaccines currently in
trial).
I am therefore curious about the data that suggest that this mutation and
not other more typical non-microbiologic factors (length of time between
vaccination and exposure, number of booster doses etc.) is the cause of the
cases in question. Have these cases been written up or otherwise described
in more detail somewhere? Or does someone have any more specific detail
about these cases?
[P. Elmsley and N.W. Isaacs of the University of Glasgow have solved the
x-ray crystal structure of pertactin
(<http://www.nrc.ca/programs/ACA95/big/a650.html>). In addition, they find
an RGD sequence which could facilitate binding to integrin receptors of
target cells in a manner that has been previously demonstrated for the _B.
pertussis_ hemagglutinin. It is also noteworthy that the SmithKline
acellular pertussis vaccine includes antigens for both pertactin and
hemagglutinin.
Thus, it is apparent that more than one cell surface component may
contribute to interactions of the organism with host target cells, and it
would seem that a mutation in one of them could enhance infectivity of the
organism in partially immune persons. Any additional information about
the efficacy of monocomponent vaccines or characterization of the organism
responsible for the Netherlands outbreak known to our subscribers would be
appreciated. -Mod. ES
