92 foot and mouth sites found in Argentina
------------------------------------------
BUENOS AIRES -- Argentina's food safety agency reported [that the number
of sites touched by foot-and-mouth disease (FDM) throughout the country has
risen to 92, while the business sector prepared a retaliatory block on
European imports.
Buenos Aires province has been hit hardest by the disease, with 71 affected
sites reported, according to the National Food Safety and Quality Service.
A group of farmers, business owners, and labor unions announced that they
would block imports from European Union (EU) nations [from April 16, in
retaliation for the EU's 'discriminatory' decision to ban Argentine meat
imports because of FMD outbreaks.
Meat production is a staple of the economy of Argentina, which has roughly
50 million head of cattle and another 10 million sheep. "Europe's decision
was not based on any logical technical criterion, since Europe always
bought boneless Argentine beef with a pH of 4.5, a semi-acidic level at
which the virus cannot survive," Mr Enrique Crotto, president of the
Argentine Agricultural Society, said on Wednesday.
