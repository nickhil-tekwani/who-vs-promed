Five people have died from Ebola in Uganda and another 19 deaths were likely caused by the disease, the president said on Wednesday [28 Sep 2022], but he said he would not order a lockdown because Ebola is easier to manage than COVID-19.

The outbreak of the deadly hemorrhagic fever was announced last week [week of 19 Sep 2022], triggering fears of a major health crisis in the country of 45 million people. There is no vaccine for the Sudan strain of the disease behind the latest Uganda infections.

In a televised address President Yoweri Museveni said that in addition to 5 confirmed Ebola fatalities, another 19 deaths in the community were likely due to the disease as they displayed similar symptoms but samples were not taken from them to confirm this before their deaths.

Another 19 cases of the disease have also been confirmed, he said. He said that among the other confirmed infections were 6 health workers, including 4 doctors, one anesthesiologist, and one medical student.

"Wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based sanitizer. Avoid contact with body fluids from any person," Museveni said, adding that Ebola outbreaks were easier to manage than coronavirus, which is airborne.

Ebola mainly spreads through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. The viral disease has symptoms including intense weakness, muscle pain, headaches, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhoea, and rashes among others.

The World Health Organization says the Ebola Sudan strain is less transmissible and has shown a lower fatality rate in previous outbreaks than its cousin Ebola Zaire, a strain that killed nearly 2300 people in a 2018--2020 epidemic in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.

The latest infections broke out in Mubende district in central Uganda, about 140 kilometres [about 87 mi] west of the capital Kampala. It has since spread to 2 more districts.

"The government has got capacity to control this outbreak as we have done before. Therefore there is no need for anxiety, panic, restriction of movement, or closure of public places," Museveni said.

[Six healthcare workers including 4 doctors, 1 anesthesiologist, and 1 medical student are among the confirmed cases of Ebola Sudan in Uganda. That number is high considering the number of total cases. It is critical that personal protective clothing and equipment are provided to healthcare workers and others on the front line as soon as possible. - Mod.LK]

A week after its detection, the Ebola outbreak in Uganda appeared in new territories, health authorities reported, according to which the deaths due to the disease totaled 23.

Last Tuesday [20 Sep 2022], Ugandan health specialists confirmed the appearance of the disease in the district of Mubende (center) from a rare strain named Sudan, and hours before they admitted that the virus appeared in the neighboring districts of Kyegegwa and Kassanda.

The new infections brought the total number of cases, including deaths, confirmed and probable, to 36.

The Ebola virus was first identified in 1976 in the then Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo, but the impact of the disease was felt in full force during the pandemic between 2014 and 2016.

During that period, 28 546 infected people were detected on 3 continents: Africa, Europe, and the Americas, of which 11 323 died.

[The virus continues to spread and cases to increase slowly, with the current case count at 36, with 23 deaths. Numbers are likely to continue to increase as contacts are identified, but with the knowledge the country has in fighting Ebola, it is hoped numbers won't explode. - Mod.LK

[3] Congo DR (North Kivu): end of outbreak declared

The Democratic Republic of Congo has declared the end of its latest Ebola virus outbreak in the eastern province of North Kivu, Health Minister Jean-Jacques Mbungani Mbanda said in a statement on Tuesday [27 Sep 2022].

The 15th outbreak in the central African country emerged when a new case of the deadly virus was confirmed in the eastern city of Beni on 22 Aug 2022.

Testing showed the case was genetically linked to the 2018-2020 outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, which killed nearly 2300 people.

Another flare-up from that outbreak killed 6 people last year [2021].

"After 42 days of reinforced surveillance without a new confirmed case... I am happy to solemnly declare the end of the 15th [Ebola] epidemic... that lasted one month and 12 days," Mbungani Mbanda said.

Congo's dense tropical forests are a natural reservoir for the Ebola virus, which causes fever, body aches, and diarrhoea.

The country has recorded 14 outbreaks since 1976. The 2018-2020 outbreak in the east was Congo's largest and the 2nd largest ever recorded, with nearly 3500 total cases.

Congo's most recent outbreak was in northwest Equateur province. It was declared over in July 2022 after 5 deaths.
