The Bihar government has issued an alert following the detection of
the 1st ever outbreak of chikungunya [virus infections] in the state.
The executive director of the State Health Society, Sanjay Kumar, told
AIR [News On Air] that with the detection of 3 fresh cases, the total
number of chikungunya patients has risen to 37.

All civil surgeons have been instructed to take appropriate and timely
measures for management of the mosquito-borne viral fever.

The state government has asked the health officials to monitor all
types of fever where confirmed cases of chikungunya have been
reported.

Chief minister Nitish Kumar directed the health department to start
marathon fogging of areas of higher density on a priority basis.

[There have been a few reported small outbreaks of chikungunya virus
infections in India -- the most recent in Delhi and in Uttar Pradesh
state. The report above of cases in Bihar also indicates that a mixed
chikungunya and dengue outbreak is occurring there. Both viruses are
transmitted by the same mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_. Fogging to reduce
adult mosquitoes will provide only temporary reduction in virus
transmission. Elimination of breeding sites in and around houses will
have a longer-lasting effect on control of this mosquito.
