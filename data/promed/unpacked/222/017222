The good news is that the population of Indian River County scrub
jays has not dropped. The bad news is that the scrub jay population
in both Archbold Biological Station in Lake Placid and Disney's
Wilderness Reserve in Kissimmee recorded a large immediate drop,
about 47 percent, in their juvenile Florida scrub jay population 2
weeks ago, officials said.

The unsettling news is that it could only be a matter of time before
Indian River sees that kind of dip.

"We went out to investigate, and we are very relived that our jays
seem to be OK," said Beth Powell, the county's conservation lands
manager.

In and around the Sebastian area, 43 scrub jays have been banded and
are currently being monitored; 20 of those jays are juveniles.

The decline of the juvenile birds is very distressing, Ms. Powell
said, and if the population drop were to come from a disease that
could spread, the effect on Central Florida jays could be
catastrophic.

Scrub jays and crows seem to be more susceptible to mosquito-bred
diseases, such as West Nile or [other] encephalitis, and
[mosquito-transmitted viruses] could be the culprit for the decline,
Ms. Powell said. "There are a lot of different factors as to why
Archbold's jays have gone down and ours haven't," she said.
"Different rainfalls mean different mosquitoes and different
mosquito-borne diseases. Also, our nesting season is 3-4 weeks earlier
than theirs, and our jays are that much more grown," said Ms. Powell.

There is always the concern that the disease could still reach the
Sebastian-area birds. "The big question mark is that maybe it just
hasn't gotten here yet," said Ms. Powell. "There are a lot of areas
we can't access that are potential habitats for scrub jays, so the
only way we can know absolutely for sure about our jays is to check
the one in the north county area," said Ms.
Powell.

Florida scrub jays are a species found only in Florida and are
considered a vulnerable and declining species in terms of population.
Their favored habitats are well-drained scrubby areas with hardy
plants such as Chapman's oak, scrub oak and sand pines.

[The Florida scrub jay (_Aphelocoma coerulescens_) is one of the few
native birds of Florida.

This article does not give many indications as to what is causing the
drop in numbers. The article mentions mosquitoes, but it does not
indicate that West Nile virus has been diagnosed in the area. As of
30 Sep 2008, not a single bird had tested positive in Florida since
2005 -- see <http://diseasemaps.usgs.gov/wnv_fl_bird.html>.
We would appreciate more information.
