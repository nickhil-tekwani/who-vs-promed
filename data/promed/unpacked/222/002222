Hospitals in Rhode Island are reporting an increase in the number of patients possibly exposed to rabies, and even though there have been no reported cases in the state recently, health officials are warning you to be on the lookout.

Just yesterday [12 Aug 2014], 4 children were treated at Hasbro Children's Hospital for possible rabies exposure.

If you've noticed a sudden increase of bats flying around your yard, it's no coincidence. August is mating season for bats, so they're out in full force -- and some could burrow in your attic. Bats, according to health experts, are the only flying mammal that can carry disease, rabies being the most common.

"Your odds of contracting rabies in the United States are actually fairly low -- there are about 2 cases reported per year nationally -- however, many of those cases are traced to bats," said Gary Bubly, M.D., Director of Emergency Medicine at Miriam Hospital. "If you have been exposed, it is worthwhile calling to speak to an expert to determine whether or not the vaccine would be indicated."

What may surprise you is the number of patients being treated for possible rabies exposure. Since June [2014], 160 patients have received rabies vaccinations at hospitals in the state, with the majority of those being children. In June, 26 children were treated for possible rabies exposure, according to Hasbro, and it was up to 36 in July [2014]. So far in August [2014], 33 kids have been treated, and we're not even halfway through the month.

"Most of the time, these are people that have found a bat in their home and often were not bitten," Dr. Bubly said. Dr, Bubly said you don't necessarily have to be bitten to be at risk of exposure. "The bites from the bats can be quite small and virtually imperceptible, particularly to someone who's asleep. Also, there may have been contact with mucous membranes, for example the eyes or the mouth or an open wound, that could result in transmission of the virus," he explained.

Health officials warn if you come into contact with a bat, whether it be in your home, yard, or through your pet, you should immediately contact the health department. An official will then determine if your exposure requires vaccinations. If you're exposed to a rabid bat and do not get vaccinated, rabies is almost always fatal.

It's crucial to tell your children if they come into contact with a live or dead bat to let you know immediately. Also, the myth about those rabies shots being extremely painful is no longer true, according to Dr. Bubly. The shots are similar to any other vaccination you get, but unfortunately you just need a series of rabies shots over a short period of time.

[Bat exposures should be taken seriously. If you suspect that you have been exposed, contact the heath authorities. Having had my share of regular "rabies shots" -- I'm a veterinarian, right? -- I can assure you that the current injections are very mild compared to my 1st shots in 1965. The survival rate from clinical rabies is trivial, so roll up your sleeve, or your child's sleeve. - Mod.MHJ
