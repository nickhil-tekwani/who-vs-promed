Mexico: West Nile Virus Infection Surveillance Data as of Wed 24 Sep 2003
--------------------------------------------------
The following figures are reproduced from the Resumen Epidemiologica
accompanying the Maps of West Nile Virus Activity in Mexico
Cumulative totals - Humans
--------------------------
As of Wed 24 Sep 2003, a total of 452 individuals resident in 20 of
the 32 states have been tested for evidence of West Nile virus
infection. All 452 were asymptomatic and seronegative.
Cumulative totals - Equines
---------------------------
As of Wed 24 Sep 2003, a total of 3919 horses from 19 of the 32
states have been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of
these animals 984 were seropositive and 2934 seronegative. All these
animals were asymptomatic. In addition, one animal in the state of
Nuevo Leon, which had the highest incidence of seropositive animals,
was symptomatic and died.
Cumulative totals - Birds
-------------------------
As of Wed 24 Sep 2003, a total of 17 086 birds from 8 of the 32
states have been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of
these birds 63 were seropositive (and considered to be asymptomatic)
and 17 021 were seronegative. In addition, 2 dead birds were
seropositive.

[These data are strikingly different from those recorded in North
America with regard to the lower incidence of disease and mortality
in Mexico in the case of animals that have tested seropositive for
West Nile virus infection. As commented previously, this situation
raises questions about the possible existence of cross-reactivity, as
a consequence of infection with other related flaviviruses, both in
terms of conferring protection or generating false positivity.
Further information is awaited with interest. - Mod.CP]
