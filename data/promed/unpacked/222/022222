CROHN'S DISEASE & MEASLES

[In a discussion on variable host susceptibility, Stuart Neilson provided
the following information on the proposed relationship between Crohn's
disease and measles. AHED-Mod MHJ]

There is certainly evidence of variable susceptibility to small-pox,
malaria, syphilis and measles. Immunisation for the latter (measles / mumps
/ rubella) has been implicated in the later development of Crohn's disease,
which in itself is an interesting finding in regard to your comments. Some
more recent studies (abstracts below) have failed to isolate measles or an
immune response in Crohn's disease, which weakens the argument for a causal
link of (early measles exposure) -> (later Crohn's disease).
One possible interpretation of this pair of findings is that there exists a
group of genetic variants who are both highly susceptible to both measles
death (about, if I remember correctly, 3,000 deaths per annum in the UK up
to the 1960's, now zero) and to Crohn's disease (uncommon prior to the
1960's, now about 3,000 new diagnoses per year). If this were so, then a
successful measles eradication programme resulted in a greater proportion of
Crohn's sufferers in the population, because they have received a greater
benefit from immunisation than an average member.
In the case of CJD, what kind of experiments or analyses would be convincing
evidence that "sporadic" CJD is an artifact of incomplete knowledge? And how
could one apply this to "predicting the course of the epidemic"?

Some recent abstracts on measles and Crohn's:
Sartor, RB; Rath, HC; Sellon, RK. Microbial factors in chronic intestinal
inflammation. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology 1996;12(4):327-333.
This review summarizes recent investigations of microbial influences in
ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and experimental intestinal
inflammation in rodents, Current data do not suggest that a specific
persistent infection causes Crohn's disease but indicate that resident
(normal) luminal bacteria induce chronic intestinal and systemic
inflammation in genetically susceptible hosts. Anaerobic bacteria and
bacterial products appear to be dominant stimulants in Crohn's disease and
experimental colitis, whereas functionally abnormal aerobes may be involved
in ulcerative colitis. Viable bacteria secondarily invade ulcerated mucosa,
and enhanced uptake of bacterial cell wall polymers, chemotactic molecules,
and antigens across the inflamed mucosa activate lamina propria inflammatory
cells to perpetuate local inflammation. Systemic distribution of bacterial
constituents leads to extraintestinal manifestations. The delicate balance
between luminal microbial constituents and protective mucosal forces can be
disturbed by genetically determined immunoregulatory abnormalities and
environmental triggers, leading to chronic, relapsing intestinal inflammation.

intestinal tissues from Crohn's disease by nested polymerase chain-reaction.
Gut 1996;38(2):211-215.
The aetiology of Crohn's disease remains unknown, although evidence for a
viral cause has long been sought. Recent studies have shown inflammation of
the submucosal microvascular endothelium and granulomata, and endothelial
cell cytoplasmic inclusions, consistent with paramyxovirus, were identified
by electron microscopy suggesting a persistent measles virus infection in
Crohn's disease. Measles, mumps, and rubella viruses were tested for Crohn's
disease by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RNA was extracted from resected
intestinal specimens from 15 patients with Crohn's disease, 14 with
ulcerative colitis, and 14 controls without inflammatory bowel disease. This
was used to perform nested PCR after reverse transcription (RT) of the RNA
to cDNA with primer pairs directed against two regions in the genome of the
measles virus and one region in the mumps and rubella viral genomes. Despite
enhanced sensitivity of nested RT-PCR, measles, mumps, and rubella viral
genomic sequences were not found in any intestinal specimen.

Pounder, RE. Measles virus and Crohn's disease - Research from the Royal
Free Hospital in London. Journal of Gastroenterology 1995;30(S8):48-51.
This paper provides a summary of a 6-year program of research by the
Inflammatory Bowel Disease Study Group at the Royal Free Hospital and School
of Medicine, London. Research has demonstrated:
1. That Crohn's disease is associated with profound damage to the mesenteric
vascular blood supply, even in areas where tissue or bowel appear
macroscopically normal;
2. That Crohn's disease is a granulomatous vasculitis;
3. That aphthous ulceration is due to damage to underlying blood vessels;
4. That Crohn's disease is associated with a hypercoagulable state, and that
patients with hemophilia rarely develop Crohn's disease;
5. That measles virus genome is localized to foci of granulomatous
vasculitis and lymphoid follicles in the bowel of patients with Crohn's
disease.
In conclusion, we have not proved that measles virus is the cause of Crohn's
disease. Proof may be difficult until there is a specific anti-viral drug
that is able to eradicate this RNA virus.

Thompson, NP; Pounder, RE; Wakefield, AJ. Perinatal and childhood risk
factors for inflammatory bowel disease - A case-control study. European
Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology 1995;7(5):385-390.
Objective: To determine whether exposure to a measles epidemic in utero or
in infancy is a risk factor for the development of Crohn's disease, and to
determine whether such an association can be found in individuals with
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a condition in which early
infection with measles is known to be of aetiological importance.
Methods: A postal questionnaire was sent to 16875 members of two national
inflammatory bowel disease patient support groups. A control group was
composed of friends or neighbours. Birth data were compared with the dates
of measles epidemics and six possible periods of susceptibility were
examined. Birth data from a national register of patients with SSPE were
analysed similarly. Previously identified risk factors were also examined.
Results: The answers from 2522 members and 2379 controls were analysed. We
found no evidence of an association between the development of Crohn's
disease and exposure to a measles epidemic. The birth dates of both groups
were distributed normally throughout the year. No other early risk factor
for the development of inflammatory bowel disease was detected. Exposure to
a measles epidemic before the age of 1 year did not emerge as a risk factor
for SSPE.
Conclusion: These data contradict reports from a recent study in central
Sweden, but relatively early exposure to measles in childhood may still be a
risk factor for the development of Crohn's disease.
