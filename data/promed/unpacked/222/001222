During the past one month [29 Jun - 28 Jul 2007], Japanese
encephalitis has led to the death of 56 persons in the 5 districts of
Sivasagar, Dibruagarh, Tinsukia, Lakhimpur and Dhemaji with children
occupying a sizeable portion in this figure. Disclosing this at a
press conference here this afternoon, Health Minister Himanta Biswa
Sarma said that it was doubted that the disease had killed 160
persons so far in these districts. But of these cases, only 56 could
be confirmed to be related to the disease. Samples of the rest of the
cases are sent to the Pune-based National Institute of Virology for
confirmation, he said.
Giving the breakdown of those suspected to be killed by the disease,
he said, 23 cases of death had been reported from Sivasagar and of
them 8 are children. From Dibrugarh district, 12 cases of death have
been reported and of them 4 are children and these children were not
vaccinated.
From Dhemaji district, 12 cases of death have been reported and of
them 4 are children. A similar number of cases have been reported
from Lakhimpur district and of them 3 are children. From Tinsukia
district, 7 cases of death have been reported and of them 2 are
children, he said.
So far, vaccination to prevent the outbreak of the disease could be
[have been? - Mod.TY] carried out in the 4 districts of Jorhat,
Golaghat, Sivasagar and Dibruagarh. But in Sivasagar district, about
8 percent of the children have been left out. The State Health
Department will renew the vaccination programme in the district.
In case of the vaccination programme also, only the persons between
0-15 years of age group could be [have been? - Mod.TY] administered
the vaccine produced in China. The cost of the vaccine is also
prohibitive: around Rs 92 [USD 2.27]. This does not include the cost
of the syringe, he said.
The case of the vaccination programme in Lakhimpur and Dhemaji
districts have been taken up with the Union Government and it is
expected that the programme could be undertaken in both the districts
in October and November next [2007]. The vaccination programme in
Tinsukia district may be undertaken in Tinsukia district in 2008, he said.

[It is tragic when a relatively inexpensive, effective and safe
vaccine does not reach susceptible individuals because of cost, but
that is the dilemma faced in many developing countries.
