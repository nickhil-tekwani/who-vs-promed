[The following are the private comments of Richard Thomas and do not

The threat posed by Highly Pathogenic H5N1 is still present and the virus
is evading attempts to control its spread.
Today, it is generally recognised by the FAO and others that the major
vector spreading the virus is movement of poultry and poultry products
within the poultry industry, and not wild birds:
<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-11/02/content_5283058.htm>
The presence of the virus [in] a national poultry industry can have massive
financial consequences, both on the industry itself and even on national
tourism, and it is perhaps not surprising that government cover-ups of the
presence of H5N1 have been alleged:
<http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2004/s1032638.htm>
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3427249.stm>
<http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/bird-flu-coverup-alleged/2005/10/20/1129775901802.html>
Findings indicating arrival of the virus from within the poultry industry
have been played down in favour of an alternative theory claiming arrival
via wild birds: <http://www.the-scientist.com/news/20050715/01/>
However, the movement of H5N1 from outside its Asian core range to Eastern
Europe, Africa, the Middle East and South Asia all tally much better with
movement through the poultry trade than through wild bird migration.
Outbreaks from China leading west to Eastern Europe follow road and railway
lines. No wild bird migrates in this direction, nor does any species spend
the spring in the east of its range, but autumn in the west. The outbreaks
broadly follow the Silk Road, a well-established trading route, and there
are reports of long-distance H5N1 transport from a contaminated poultry
factory in a city directly on this route:
<http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload/152954/AVIbull006x.pdf>
See also moderator MHJ's comment in: ProMED-mail, Avian influenza, poultry
vs migratory birds (02) Archive 20060218.0536 posted 18 February 2006.
Outbreaks in Egypt and India occurred within the commercial poultry
industry (and there is at least one report that defective vaccines were
involved): <http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/794/eg7.htm>
The transfer of the virus to Nigeria was, with hindsight, entirely
predictable, based on economic and trade considerations. Poultry imports to
Nigeria were officially banned because of H5N1 fears, but the country
lacked the technology to raise sufficient day-old chicks to meet its own
demands, and commercial poultry farmers were calling for the ban to be
lifted.
<http://www.zartechltd.com/news/Magazine/Jan_200.../jan2005mag.asp?pageno=Page%2021&pagepix=21.jpg>
To overcome the shortage, chicks were being imported illegally, with China
and Turkey both stated by the Nigerian Agriculture Minister as sources,
whilst chicks were being flown from Egypt to the Niger Republic via Kano
airport in Nigeria -- where the first case of H5N1 was reported in a
commercial "biosecure" farm (both Egypt and the Niger Republic reported the
virus a few days later):
<http://www.birdlife.org/news/pr/2006/02/avian_flu_nigeria.html>
The FAO found that backyard poultry production was, at least in Thailand,
less risky in terms of H5N1 infection than closed, "biosecure" poultry
factories, a finding that doesn't implicate wild birds in the virus's
spread:
<http://www.fao.org/AG/AGAINFO/projects/en/pplpi/docarc/pb_hpaibiosecurity.html>
There was a similar finding in Laos, where 42 of 45 outbreaks were found on
commercial enterprises:
<http://www.fas.usda.gov/gainfiles/200503/146119131.pdf>
The recent outbreaks in South Korea follow a similar pattern (as did
outbreaks in Nigeria, Egypt, India and Japan) with "biosecure" operations
infected, but adjacent, "less-secure" farms unaffected:
<http://www.birdskorea.org/eyewitnessDEC06.asp>
Other potentially major virus-spreading vectors that appear to be little
researched include the spreading of poultry manure on fields (see the
"muck-spreading" photograph accompanying
<http://www.fao.org/AG/AGAINFO/projects/en/pplpi/docarc/pb_hpaibiosecurity.html>,
overflow ponds associated with poultry operations, which can lead to
contamination of the surrounding environment:
<http://www.uswaternews.com/archives/arcrights/3tysple7.html>, and the use
of chicken faeces as animal feed.
All of these are plausible sources for the virus that contaminated wild
bird populations in the Black Sea region in early 2006. Subsequent cold
weather led to a scattering of dead H5N1-infected wild birds across several
European countries. To date, this represents the strongest evidence that
wild birds can fly a significant distance before dying after infection. A
recent paper argues that wild birds are victims of biosecurity lapses
within the poultry industry, but that once contaminated, they are unlikely
to be able to sustain the virus for any length of time:
<http://www.mun.ca/serg/Muzaffar06AvianFluFinal.pdf>. As expected, the
European outbreaks ended abruptly, and there is no evidence the virus has
persisted in wild bird populations.
As the European cases show, there is no doubt that wild birds are involved
to some degree in the virus's spread, but this role has been massively
overstated by some (especially the media). The key to halting the virus's
further spread undoubtedly lies with better biosecurity measures within the
global poultry industry.
