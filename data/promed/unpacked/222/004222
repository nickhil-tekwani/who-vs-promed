In relation to the recent cowpox report on ProMED (archive number

from the French InVS [Institut de Veille Sanitaire] detailing the 21
cases in humans in northern France [region of Oise], the locations of
cases, and epidemiological investigation.

As of 18 Feb 2009, 21 notifications were received by InVS, of which
20 were investigated and one is currently under investigation. Of the
20 suspected cases, 8 were confirmed as due to cowpox, 4 as an
orthopox virus, and 8 are under analysis. 14 are female. The median
age is 18 (4-54). The date of 1st symptoms were between 29 Dec 2008
and 16 Feb 2009 (see:
