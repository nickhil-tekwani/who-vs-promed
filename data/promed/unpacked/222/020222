USA (Nepal ex USA (undetermined location). 25 Jan 2018. On [24 Jan 2018], a 55-year male presented with a 10-day history of fever, severe body ache, severe joint pain, sweating, nausea, and pain behind the eyes. He had a history of travel to USA (visited 6 states; Utah, Ohio, Colorado [which were in the winter season at the time of the visit] California [which has reported presence of mosquito vectors but no reported dengue cases], and 2 additional unidentified states), where he spent 35 days. He developed these symptoms 4 days prior to his arrival to Nepal. He tested positive for dengue virus (IgG), suggesting recent secondary dengue virus infection. At present (winter season), dengue virus infection is uncommon in Kathmandu but dengue cases from neighboring countries such as India or Bangladesh are frequently seen in Nepal. However, dengue imported from the US, as seen in this case, is extremely rare or reported in Nepal.

[2] Zika cross protection against dengue

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Zika and dengue viruses are closely related flaviviruses, with immunological interactions and identical urban, mosquito-borne transmission. Therefore, the recent introduction of Zika virus into the Americas and large-scale exposure of a uniformly previously unexposed population could affect subsequent transmission of dengue virus. This hypothesis had been untested, largely because sufficient epidemiological data were not available from affected locations. We explored this hypothesis in Salvador, the 4th largest city in Brazil (population 2.9 million), where extensive transmission of dengue viruses 1-4 occurred before the introduction and spread of Zika virus in 2015.

[Findings]
----------
Our findings, indicating lower frequencies of confirmed dengue virus lasting more than 2 years since early 2015 -- which are lower than at any other period analysed since 2009 -- raised the hypothesis that the 2015 outbreak of Zika virus might have inhibited transmission of dengue virus or of symptomatic infections. Because serological tests for dengue virus, especially IgM ELISA, cross-react with Zika-virus-immune serum samples, it is possible that some citywide cases diagnosed as dengue since 2015 were actually cases of Zika virus. Nonetheless, a major downward trend in dengue cases occurred after the Zika virus outbreak. Few confirmed cases of Zika virus occurred during the Zika virus epidemic, probably reflecting an initial period of inadequate diagnostics. However, there is a strong consensus that northeastern Brazil (where Salvador is located) was the epicentre for the 2015 Zika virus epidemic, and a previous investigation suggested that Zika virus was the most likely cause for the acute exanthematous illness outbreak in the same year in which around 15 000 cases were reported in Salvador by mid-2015.

Aside from sexual Zika virus transmission, the transmission cycles of Zika virus, dengue virus, and chikungunya virus rely on human amplification by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. In our study, the proportion of patients with acute febrile illness who tested positive for chikungunya virus was highest in the 2nd half of 2015 and throughout 2016. The prolonged and increased positivity rate for chikungunya virus, an alphavirus with no antigenic relationship to Zika virus or dengue virus, suggests that the 2015-17 reduction in dengue virus infections was unrelated to changes in vector efficiency (such as lower vector populations related to weather or control), or to other non-immunological factors.

Although temporal associations do not prove causation, the strength and consistency from both enhanced surveillance and citywide data, together with the observed maintenance of high detection of chikungunya virus after the Zika virus outbreak, suggest that Zika virus infections could induce cross-protective immunity against dengue virus. Prospective studies are needed to fully assess the subsequent risk of dengue after Zika virus exposure and determine whether the putative cross-protection is long-lasting or wanes over time. More specific serological assays, such as assays used for neutralising antibodies, might also help to show this effect more conclusively. If further studies support our hypothesis, they will have direct implications for epidemiological surveillance, immunological investigations of pathogenesis, and vaccine development and assessment.

[It will be interesting to see if this apparent cross-protection lasts over time. A question for the future is if declining Zika virus antibodies might cross-react with but not neutralize dengue viruses and cause antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection with more serious disease. - Mod.TY]

[3] Dengue ADE (antibody-dependent enhancement)

ref: Katzelnick LC, Gresh L, Halloran ME, et al. Antibody-dependent enhancement of severe dengue disease in humans. Science. 2017; 358(6365): 929-32. doi: 10.1126/science.aan6836
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
For dengue viruses (DENV1-4), a specific range of antibody titer has been shown to enhance viral replication in vitro and severe disease in animal models. Although suspected, such antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of severe disease has not been shown to occur in humans. Using multiple statistical approaches to study a long-term pediatric cohort in Nicaragua, we show that risk of severe dengue disease is highest within a narrow range of pre-existing anti-DENV antibody titers. By contrast, we observe protection from all symptomatic dengue disease at high antibody titers. Thus, immune correlates of severe dengue must be evaluated separately from correlates of protection against symptomatic disease. These results have implications for studies of dengue pathogenesis and for vaccine development, because enhancement, not just lack of protection, is of concern.

[Although there has been a presumption for many years that ADE can enhance dengue disease in humans, the report above goes beyond the previous studies in animals and cells in culture to indicate that this phenomenon occurs in people as well. - Mod.TY]

[4] Co-opts cell protein synthesis

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
A primary question in dengue virus (DENV) biology is the molecular strategy for recruitment of host cell protein synthesis machinery. Here we combined cell fractionation, ribosome profiling, and RNA-seq to investigate the subcellular organization of viral genome translation and replication as well as host cell translation and its response to DENV infection. We report that throughout the viral life cycle, DENV (+) and (-) strand RNAs were highly partitioned to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), identifying the ER as the primary site of DENV translation. DENV infection was accompanied by an ER compartment-specific remodeling of translation, where ER translational capacity was subverted from host transcripts to DENV (+) strand RNA, particularly at late stages of infection. Remarkably, translation levels and patterns in the cytosol compartment were only modestly affected throughout the experimental time course of infection. Comparisons of ribosome footprinting densities of the DENV (+) strand RNA and host mRNAs indicated that DENV (+) strand RNA was only sparsely loaded with ribosomes. Combined, these observations suggest a mechanism where ER-localized translation and translational control mechanisms, likely cis-encoded, are used to repurpose the ER for DENV virion production. Consistent with this view, we found ER-linked cellular stress response pathways commonly associated with viral infection, namely the interferon response and unfolded protein response, to be only modestly activated during DENV infection. These data support a model where DENV reprograms the ER protein synthesis and processing environment to promote viral survival and replication, while minimizing the activation of anti-viral and proteostatic stress response pathways.

Importance
DENV, a prominent human health threat with no broadly effective or specific treatment, depends on host cell translation machinery for viral replication, immune evasion, and virion biogenesis. The molecular mechanism by which DENV commandeers the host cell protein synthesis machinery and the subcellular organization of DENV replication and viral protein synthesis is poorly understood. Here we report that DENV has an almost exclusively ER-localized life cycle, with viral replication and translation largely restricted to the ER. Surprisingly, DENV infection largely affects only ER-associated translation, with relatively modest effects on host cell translation in the cytosol. DENV RNA translation is very inefficient, likely representing a strategy to minimize disruption of ER proteostasis. Overall these findings demonstrate that DENV has evolved an ER- compartmentalized life cycle and thus targeting the molecular signatures and regulation of the DENV-ER interaction landscape may reveal strategies for therapeutic intervention.
