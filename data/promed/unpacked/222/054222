Abstract
--------
Background
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) remains a major concern for global public health. Dromedaries are the source of human zoonotic infection. MERS-CoV is enzootic among dromedaries on the Arabian Peninsula, the Middle East, and in Africa. Over 70% of infected dromedaries are found in Africa. However, all known zoonotic cases of MERS have occurred in the Arabian Peninsula with none being reported in Africa.

Aim
We aimed to investigate serological evidence of MERS-CoV infection in humans living in camel-herding areas in Morocco to provide insights on whether zoonotic transmission is taking place.

Methods
We carried out a cross-sectional seroprevalence study from November 2017 through January 2018. We adapted a generic World Health Organization MERS-CoV questionnaire and protocol to assess demographic and risk factors of infection among a presumed high-risk population. ELISA, MERS-CoV spike pseudoparticle neutralisation tests (ppNT), and plaque neutralisation tests (PRNT) were used to assess MERS-CoV seropositivity.

Results
Serum samples were collected from camel slaughterhouse workers (n = 137), camel herders (n = 156), and individuals of the general population without occupational contact with camels but living in camel herding areas (n = 186). MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies with 90% or more reduction of plaque numbers were detected in 2 (1.5%) slaughterhouse workers, none of the camel herders, and one individual from the general population (0.5%).

Conclusions
This study provides evidence of zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV in Morocco in people who have direct or indirect exposure to dromedary camels.

[MERS-CoV virus is listed among the 10 priority emerging diseases of the World Health Organization in terms of research and diagnosis.

In the article above, serological evidence of infection in people who have direct and indirect exposure to dromedary camels has been reported. Virus circulation among camels has been reported in camels in some African countries, including Egypt, Morocco, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, and Nigeria.

Additional information can be found at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723520/ and https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2017.22.13.30498. - Mod.SF]

[It is interesting to see evidence of exposure to the MERS-CoV in individuals with known frequent exposure to the dromedary camels outside of the Arabian Peninsula. As a reminder, there was documentation of waning immunity among individuals with milder clinical disease, which might explain the low prevalence of antibodies. It would be interesting to look at possible deaths among the high-risk individual pools during the preceding years (possibly going back to 2012 to coincide with our 1st recognition of the MERS-CoV in humans). - Mod.MPP
