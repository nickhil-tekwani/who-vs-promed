Coffee ringspot virus (CoRSV) (family _Rhabdoviridae_) is transmitted by
_Brevipalpus phoenicis_ (Geijskes) (Acari: _Tenuipalpidae_). Coffee
ringspot disease was first reported in coffee plants from Brazil in 1939 (1).
In August 2000, severe symptoms [concentric ringspots and "oak leaf"
patterns on coffee leaves] (_Coffea arabica_ L. cv. Catuai) were observed
during field inspections conducted in 2 areas of San Gabriel de
Desamparados, Costa Rica. The disease caused premature fruit and leaf drop
in the affected plants. Some areas within the ringspot lesions remained
green on senescent leaves.
Because CoRSV particles remain restricted to lesion[s](1), ... this virus
has not been purified, and antiserum for virus detection is not available.
Therefore, leaves with symptoms were collected and examined by transmission
electron microscopy. In ultrathin sections of symptomatic leaves, arrays of
rhabdovirus-like particles were associated with the nucleus as described
for CoRSV (2). Healthy tissues did not contain similar arrays of
bacilliform [or] bullet-shaped particles.
20 ... mites collected from ... infected plants at the same locations and
time were slide-mounted and identified as _B. phoenicis_. High [mite]
populations ... were also observed infesting plants of _Cajanus cajan_ L.
... intercropped with coffee at the same location. Sweet orange trees
growing in the same fields as shade for the coffee did not show symptoms of
citrus leprosis, a disease caused by another _Brevipalpus_-transmitted
virus that was recently reported in Panama (3).
To our knowledge, this is the first report of a virus similar to CoRSV in
Costa Rica. The spread of this virus, presumably CoRSV, could seriously
affect the coffee industry throughout Central America by increasing
production costs. It may be necessary to apply one or more foliar
acaricides to control the mite vector effectively.

[This coffee-infecting virus, tentatively named CoRSV, is one of more than
50 unassigned plant-infecting rhabdoviruses. In addition to Brazil and
Costa Rica, the virus is present in the Philippines. According to the
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses database, the strain in the
Philippines is reported to be seedborne, while the Brazilian strain is not.
Note: Normally I do not post reports that have been in progress for over a
year; I am making this exception because it is the first report of the
presence of the virus in Costa Rica. - Mod.DH]
