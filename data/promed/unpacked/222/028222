Two More Deaths from an Undiagnosed Fever in North Bengal
--------------------------------------------------------
SILIGURI: The death toll in the outbreak of lethal undiagnosed fever which
has raged here for the past 2 weeks rose to 34 on Sun 25 Feb 2001 with 2
more deaths reported from the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital
(NBMCH). Altogether, 25 patients were being treated in the NBMCH. However,
there were no fresh admissions on Sunday.
The state government will order administrative and police probes into the
outbreak of the fever. Most of deaths appear to be directly or indirectly
related to a particular nursing home at the Sevoke Road here. The
residential medical officer, 4 nurses and a few other staff members of the
nursing home died of the disease.
The team of experts who came here on Friday from the National Institute of
Virology, Pune, Institute of Communicable Disease and AIIMS, New Delhi and
the World Health Organisation could not arrive at any conclusion. On Monday
they will return to their respective laboratories with samples of fluid
from the patients for clinical investigation in New Delhi and Pune.
