Abstract
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic virus from camels causing significant mortality and morbidity in humans in the Arabian Peninsula. The epidemiology of the virus remains poorly understood, and while case-based and seroepidemiological studies have been employed extensively throughout the epidemic, viral sequence data have not been utilised to their full potential. Here we use existing MERS-CoV sequence data to explore its phylodynamics in 2 of its known major hosts, humans and camels. We employ structured coalescent models to show that long-term MERS-CoV evolution occurs exclusively in camels, whereas humans act as a transient, and ultimately terminal host. By analysing the distribution of human outbreak cluster sizes and zoonotic introduction times we show that human outbreaks in the Arabian peninsula are driven by seasonally varying zoonotic transfer of viruses from camels. Without heretofore unseen evolution of host tropism, MERS-CoV is unlikely to become endemic in humans.

[From the discussion chapter in the paper, the section "MERS-CoV epidemiology" is herewith presented (figures and references, deleted; are to be found in the source URL):

"In this study we aimed to understand the drivers of MERS coronavirus transmission in humans and what role the camel reservoir plays in perpetuating the epidemic in the Arabian peninsula by using sequence data collected from both hosts (174 from humans and 100 from camels). We showed that currently existing models of population structure can identify distinct demographic modes in MERS-CoV genomic data, where viruses continuously circulating in camels repeatedly jump into humans and cause small outbreaks doomed to extinction. This inference succeeds under different choices of priors for unknown demographic parameters and in the presence of strong biases in sequence sampling schemes. When rapid coalescence in the human deme is not allowed structured coalescent inference loses power and ancestral state reconstruction is nearly identical to that of discrete trait analysis. When allowed different deme-specific population sizes, the structured coalescent model succeeds because a large proportion of human sequences fall into tightly connected clusters, which informs a low estimate for the population size of the human deme. This in turn informs the inferred state of long ancestral branches in the phylogeny, i.e. because these long branches are not immediately coalescing, they are most likely in camels.

"From sequence data we identify at least 50 zoonotic introductions of MERS-CoV into humans from the reservoir, from which we extrapolate that hundreds more such introductions must have taken place. Although we recover migration rates from our model, these only pertain to sequences and in no way reflect the epidemiologically relevant per capita rates of zoonotic spillover events.

"We also looked at potential seasonality in MERS-CoV spillover into humans. Our analyses indicated a period of 3 months where the odds of a sequenced spillover event are increased, with timing consistent with an enzootic amongst camel calves. As a result of our identification of large and asymmetric flow of viral lineages into humans we also find that the basic reproduction number [R0] for MERS-CoV in humans is well below the epidemic threshold. Having said that, there are highly customisable coalescent methods available that extend the methods used here to accommodate time varying migration rates and population sizes, integrate alternative sources of information and fit to stochastic nonlinear models, which would be more appropriate for MERS-CoV.

"Some distinct aspects of MERS-CoV epidemiology could not be captured in our methodology, such as hospital outbreaks where R0 is expected to be consistently closer to 1.0 compared to community transmission of MERS-CoV. Outside of coalescent-based models there are population structure models that explicitly relate epidemiological parameters to the branching process observed in sequence data, but often rely on specifying numerous informative priors and can suffer from MCMC convergence issues.

"Strong population structure in viruses often arises through limited gene flow, either due to geography, ecology, or evolutionary forces. On a smaller scale population structure can unveil important details about transmission patterns, such as identifying reservoirs and understanding spillover trends and risk, much as we have done here. When properly understood, naturally arising barriers to gene flow can be exploited for more efficient disease control and prevention, as well as risk management".

Subscribers may find also the section on seasonality of interest (edited):

"We identify 4 months (April, May, June, July) when the odds of MERS-CoV introductions are increased and 4 when the odds are decreased (August, September, November, December). Camel calving is reported to occur from October to February, with rapidly declining maternal antibody levels in calves within the 1st weeks after birth. It is possible that MERS-CoV sweeps through each new camel generation once critical mass of susceptibles is reached, leading to a sharp rise in prevalence of the virus in camels and resulting in increased force of infection into the human population. Strong influx of susceptibles and subsequent sweeping outbreaks in camels may explain evidence of widespread exposure to MERS-CoV in camels from seroepidemiology.

"Although we found evidence of seasonality in zoonotic spillover timing, no such relationship exists for sizes of human sequence clusters. This is entirely expected, since little seasonality in human behaviour that could facilitate MERS-CoV transmission is expected following an introduction. Similarly, we do not observe any trend in human sequence cluster sizes over time, suggesting that MERS-CoV outbreaks in humans are neither growing nor shrinking in size. This is not surprising either, since MERS-CoV is a camel virus that has, to date, experienced little-to-no selective pressure to improve transmissibility between humans".

Between October 2013 and October 2017, MERS-CoV in camels was reported to the OIE from Saudi Arabia (14), Qatar (3), Iran (3), Kuwait (2), Jordan (2), Oman (1) and UAE (1); in October 2012 it was identified in a bat in Saudi Arabia. It was detected also in milk samples in Qatar.

One of the issues yet to be visited, is the striking difference between the human MERS-CoV morbidity rate in Saudi Arabia, compared to all other countries. According to WHO recent (Wed 20 Dec 2017) monthly update, addressing MERS-CoV in humans and animals, the globally accumulated number of human MERS cases totalled 2124, of which 1753 in Saudi Arabia. The update is available at http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/mers/situation_update.html.

Figure 2 in the above monthly update presents "Percentage of human MERS-CoV reported cases by source of infection and year". It shows that during the period July 2017 - to date, 34.57 percent of the human cases were "primary with animal exposure", while 37.04 percent were "primary with NO animal exposure" (the remaining cases, 24.69 and 3.70 percent, respectively, stand for "secondary cases" and "no data available). The figure's included comment says: "while infection control improves in healthcare settings and history of animal contact is recorded more consistently in case investigations, the overall number of cases has decreased. The apparent increase in proportion of primary cases with animal exposure therefore should be interpreted in the overall context of a reduced human case count".
