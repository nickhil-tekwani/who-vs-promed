The post on avian botulism [ref. above peaked my interest since I was the
veterinarian (through a volunteer wildlife rehabilitation center)
responsible for the treatment and release of several thousand California
Brown Pelicans over the last 3-4 years from the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge avian botulism outbreak.
While I agree that this report is not a emerging disaster, certainly the
millions of wild birds dying each year from this disease is significant.
This is especially troublesome when the destruction of our wetlands has
contributed by producing an artificial overcrowding of the existing areas
during migrations. On the local level this is seen by the dumping of
"Christmas ducks" and the extensive feeding of them by the public resulting
in uncontrolled proliferation, overcrowding and fecal contamination of the
bottom silt - a "petri dish" for botulism.
It is true that Federal studies done many years ago indicated that providing
shade and fresh water saved many birds. However, in our experience this
method was not effective even when birds were in stage 1 (minimal neurologic
effects -- ataxia, inability to fly but relatively normal stance). It
resulted in almost complete mortality in stage 2 and 3 birds (significant
paralysis of wings, legs, eyelids, GI tract, etc.). We clearly demonstrated
that in almost all birds in stage 1 and 2 and over 50% in stage 3,
hospitalization and rehydration with balanced electrolytes orally or
intraosseous, gavage feeding and strict attention to the prevention of
corneal desiccation resulted in very high survival and release rates.
Rehydration was usually accomplished in 48-72 hours. Natural feeding usually
resumed at 72-96 hours and recovery was uneventful from then on.
This clearly demonstrated the need to stage birds involved in these
outbreaks for rehabilitation efforts to be successful.
It should be of interest to readers that in the Salton Sea outbreak, fish
(_Tilapia_ I believe) were found to be carrying _C. botulinum_ and suffering
the effects of its toxin. The pelicans preyed on the irrationally swimming
fish and down they went.
Each year in Orange County in southern California our laboratory records
between 8 &15 mini outbreaks of avian botulism type C in small municipal
ponds and lakes. In fact, I have 4 small outbreaks involving 33 ducks of a
variety of species under investigation at this moment. As the historical
literature reports, they are related to high environmental temperatures,
pollution (excessive organic silt -- bird feces from overcrowded ponds) and
low oxygen levels in the water.
We have clearly shown by epidemiological studies that a relationship does
exist between bottom silt disturbance and botulism outbreaks. We have many
instances when dredging operations or installation of aeration pumps have
disturbed the silt and an outbreak ensued with days or weeks. Of course this
is provided other contributing factors are present. Last year we even
recommended the draining and removal of silt from a small concrete lined
municipal duck pond because of recurrent problems with botulism. The pond
was allowed to sit empty for 2 weeks in the hot sun. Within 10 days of
refilling the pond and placing the ducks (18) back on the pond all had
succumbed to botulism.
The factors contributing to outbreaks of avian botulism are many and it is
very difficult if not impossible to determine the level of causation of
each. Pardoning the pun, the ecological pathogenesis of botulism is rather
muddy to say the least. We are still rather ignorant about the ecological
events leading up to these outbreaks. We are simply not in a position to
rule out dredging and other disturbances of the bottom silt based on
temporal relationships. If conditions are beginning to "ripen" in a pond and
birds are dying, dredging can result in higher mortality. On the other hand
the effects of dredging may not be immediate but may be a favorable
rearrangement for the initiation of an outbreak days, weeks, or even months
down the road.

[I asked Richard what a "Christmas Duck" was ...
"They are young adults purchased as Christmas gifts that become too messy as
pets and are dumped in local ponds. They make up 80-90% of ducks on many
municipal ponds." The Californian version of Easter chicks. This thread is
