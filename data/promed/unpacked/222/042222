Ebola Situation Report - 16 Sep 2015
---------------------------------------
Summary
-------
There were 5 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the week to 13 Sep [2015], all of which were in Sierra Leone. Guinea recorded its 1st EVD-free week in over 12 months. All but one of the cases in Sierra Leone were registered contacts associated with the Kambia chain of transmission. A new confirmed case was also reported from the central Sierra Leonean district of Bombali, which has not reported a case for over 5 months. The case, a 16-year-old girl, had severe symptoms in the community for several days before being admitted to an Ebola treatment centre (ETC). There is considered to be a high-risk of further transmission associated with this case, and over 600 contacts have been identified so far. A rapid-response team has been deployed in order to minimise the risk of further transmission and establish the origin of infection. The total number of contacts under observation in Guinea and Sierra Leone has increased from approximately 1300 on 6 Sep [2015] to 1800 on 13 Sep [2015]. The vast majority of these contacts are located in the Sierra Leonean districts of Bombali and Kambia. Approximately 60 contacts are considered to be high-risk.

Guinea recorded a 12th consecutive day without a confirmed case on 13 Sep [2015]. The last confirmed case was reported on 1 Sep [2015] from the Ratoma area of the capital, Conakry. However, over 200 contacts remain under follow-up in Conakry and the nearby prefecture of Dubreka; the majority of contacts in Conakry are approximately halfway through their 21-day follow-up period, with those in Dubreka due to complete follow-up on 16 Sep [2015]. A total of 23 contacts have been lost to follow-up during the past 42 days, at least one of whom was considered a high-risk contact. Rapid-response teams remain on alert and ready to deploy should any further cases be reported.

Of the 5 new confirmed cases reported from Sierra Leone in the week to 13 Sep [2015], 4 were high-risk contacts associated with the Kambia transmission chain centred on several homes in the village of Sella Kafta, Tonko Limba chiefdom. All 4 cases are close relatives of the initial case in the cluster, an approximately 60-year-old woman identified as a community death during the week to 30 Aug [2015]. Over 840 contacts have been identified in association with the chain of transmission, although the majority of these contacts have been defined by geographical proximity rather than by history of possible exposure, and are therefore considered to be at low risk. Approximately 40 high-risk contacts have been identified in association with the Kambia chain of transmission; one high-risk contact has been lost to follow-up and is being traced. In addition, a case was reported from Bombali Sebora chiefdom in the district of Bombali on 13 Sep [2015]. The case, a 16-year-old girl, was symptomatic in the community for several days before her death shortly after admission to an ETC. The origin of infection is currently under investigation. Bombali had not reported a case for over 5 months. A rapid response team has been deployed to coordinate case investigation and contact tracing. Over 600 contacts in a community of approximately 800 people have been identified so far, of whom 18 are considered to be high-risk contacts; one high-risk contact has not yet been traced.

No new health worker infections were reported in the week to 13 Sep 2015. There have been a total of 881 confirmed health worker infections reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak, with 513 reported deaths.


Countries with widespread and intense transmission
-----------------------------------
There have been a total of 28 220 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1) up to 13 Sep [2015], with 11 291 reported deaths (this total includes reported deaths among probable and suspected cases, although outcomes for many cases are unknown). Five new cases were reported in the week to 13 Sep [2015], all of which were in Sierra Leone.

The total number of confirmed cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), adults aged 15 to 44 are approximately 4 times more likely to be affected in Guinea and Liberia and 3 times more likely to be affected in Sierra Leone.

No new health worker infections were reported in the week to 13 Sep [2015]. Since the start of the outbreak, a total of 881 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 513 reported deaths (table 5).

[3] Sierra Leone: new case after 169 days
Date: Mon 14 Sep 2015
Source: Pulse [edited]
http://pulse.com.gh/international/after-169-days-young-girl-in-sierra-leone-diagnosed-with-ebola-id4166322.html


According to reports from BBC's Umaru Fofana in Freetown, Sierra Leone, a 16-year-old girl has been diagnosed with the deadly Ebola virus in northern Sierra Leone's Bomabli district, which had gone for 169 days without a case.

The initial suspicion is that the girl got Ebola after having sex with a survivor of the illness, but this has not yet been confirmed.

The survivor was discharged after being treated for Ebola in March [2015], according to DR Emmnauel Conteg, who is spearheading medical care for patients in Bombali.

He said 690 people in the entire village of Robuya, just outside Makeni city, had been quarantined with 7 "high risk contacts" taken to a treatment unit.

[The girl died on Sun [13 Sep 2015] from Ebola virus disease. This is very disturbing since the Ebola survivor who is suspected of having sex with the girl had been discharged in March 2015. This adds to the growing body of evidence that the virus may survive longer than previously thought in semen, making the prospect of the country becoming Ebola-free in the immediate future more tenuous.

According to Reuters, in the nearby Kambia district on the border with Guinea, where nearly 1000 people are into their 2nd week of quarantine after the woman died, there is concern that a "high risk" contact remains on the loose, the head of Sierra Leone's Ebola response, Pallo Conteh said.

Both these events reinforce how fragile the current situation is. It will take very little to rekindle an outbreak. Until this last fatal case, transmission appeared to be under control with all contacts accounted for. - Mod.LK]

12 Sep 2015 Liberia: New Ebola research center opens today [12 Sep 2015] in Margibi
http://allafrica.com/stories/201509142436.html
[The 1st Ebola Clinical Research Study Center in rural Liberia opens Sat [12 Sep 2015] at the C.H. Rennie Hospital in Kakata, Margibi County. The study begins with more than 500 Ebola survivors currently enrolled in the Ebola Natural History Study on the compound of the J.F. Kennedy Hospital in Monrovia, and at least another 110 at the Duport Road Health Center in Paynesville....more]

15 Sep 2015 Liberia: PREVAIL launches Ebola natural history study at C. H Rennie hospital
http://allafrica.com/stories/201509151992.html
The Liberia-United States Joint Clinical Research Partnership, known as PREVAIL, today [15 Sep 2015] launched the Ebola Natural History Study at the C. H. Rennie Hospital in Kakata, Margibi County. The C. H. Rennie Hospital is the 3rd facility to join the study nearly 4 months after it began at the JFK Medical Center and the Duport Road Health Center on [17 Jun 2015] and [22 Jul 2015], respectively.

The Hospital will enroll [Ebola virus disease, EVD] survivors into the study from nearby counties, including Grand Bassa and Bong Counties, while plans are being made to open additional sites in Liberia, including the Phebe Hospital in Bong County, which will accommodate survivors from Lofa, Nimba and Grand Bassa Counties.

The study [PREVAIL III] will investigate the variety of health problems faced by people who have survived EVD and provide participants with referrals to other healthcare facilities in Liberia that have been designated by the Ministry of Health.

The study also will help to determine whether people who survived Ebola are immune or protected from getting EVD in the future. In addition, the researchers will examine whether those who survived Ebola can transmit infection to their household contacts or sexual partners....more]

15 Sep 2015 Liberia: Ebola survivors seek partnership with media
http://allafrica.com/stories/201509151836.html
[President of the National Ebola Survivors Network of Liberia [Patrick Faley] is appealing to journalists in the country to strengthen their relationships with survivors. According to Farley, "...the journalists have forgotten about us, and we depend on journalists to take the proper information to the international community or even the national government because the issue of Ebola is not just about the national government; it should claim the attention of the international community. So we want a cordial relationship between the journalists and the survivors....more]

14 Sep 2015 Liberia: Supt. Brown Hails Sirleaf's Vulnerable Households, Ebola Programs
http://allafrica.com/stories/201509142434.html
[Bomi County Superintendent Samuel Brown has lauded President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf for her economic empowerment program for vulnerable households and Ebola survivors in the country. Supt. Brown said the establishment of the Social Cash Transfer (SCT) by the Sirleaf-led Government in 2011 is key to the survival of vulnerable households, including Ebola survivors across the country. ...-more]

15 Sep 2015 Liberia: Ebola survivors to NGOs: "Don't get rich from our pains"
http://allafrica.com/stories/201509161047.html
[..."AT" was a part of over 30 survivor women who attended the Ebola survival reintegration program. In an angry tone, she said the Government and NGOs should stop making money out of survivors, saying they experienced so much pain. She states, "We felt the pains, and we know what we went through; let the Government and NGOs stop making money out of us, because sometimes they come and take our pictures, but we don't receive anything."...more]

[It appears the approach the government is taking is more about building capacity of survivors through long term empowerment, education and training, which will ensure that their lives improve, rather than through money. - Mod.LK]

http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Suspected-case-Ebola-tests-prove-negative/story-27811721-detail/story.html
[A patient admitted to Leicester Royal Infirmary yesterday [16 Sep 2015] has tested negative for the [Ebola virus disease, EVD]. The patient, who had a history of travel in West Africa, was treated in the isolation unit at the hospital after fears that he might be suffering from the infection. A spokesman for Leicester's hospitals said the patient was undergoing various tests "one of which is Ebola." He said the patient had not been admitted through the A&E department and that no other patients had been put at risk due to "the strict protocols which had been followed."]

3 Sep 2015 Sierra Leone: Using solar power to beat Ebola
http://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/news-stories/africa/sierra-leone/using-solar-power-to-beat-ebola-69317/
"IK" could not attend the community meeting in her village. The location was not far, just about 400 meters away. But, with the red line, her home was full. Her family had been quarantined because of Ebola...Before the meeting [International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, IFRC, Red Cross] volunteers visited several villages and, using mobile loudspeakers, announced the event, which would also be broadcast on radio.

Radio is a medium that can reach the most people in Sierra Leone. Statistics indicate that 80 percent of people across the country have access to one. Television is still a very expensive item; electricity is scarce, and many do not read newspapers because the illiteracy rate is high. But people also need to buy batteries for the radio, which creates an additional financial burden for each struggling family.

To address this, the Red Cross recently distributed 3000 radios to various communities in all 14 districts of the country. The radios are solar powered and wind-up. With solar energy abundant in Sierra Leone, like many regions in Africa, it made handing out radios the most sensible option.

IK, who did not have a radio, received one from the Red Cross and, despite being in quarantine, she sat on the front porch of her house, cranked the radio and listened in on the community meeting. "When the night comes, we also utilize the radio as a flashlight to look for something in the dark," said IK. Indeed, this tiny radio can also be used to charge mobile phones, although Isatu and her family do not yet have one....more]

16 Sep 2015: Fighting Ebola with a palm-sized DNA sequencer
http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/09/ebola-sequencer-dna-minion/405466/
When Lauren Cowley arrived in Guinea in June 2015, the country was still trying to contain the record-breaking Ebola epidemic that had begun in early 2014. With several new cases cropping up every week, epidemiologists had to work frantically to track the skeins of the virus as they threaded from one person to another.

Cowley was there to help. ... Speed was essential and, until recently, out of the question. Even last year [2014], the only way to carry out such work was to send samples of Ebola's genetic material to specialist labs with expensive sequencing machines, which took weeks or months to spit out the results. But by the time Cowley arrived, she could do that work herself in an ersatz desktop laboratory within 48 hours, thanks to a revolutionary sequencer called the MinION.

Unlike rival sequencers, which are as big as microwaves or fridges, the MinION is the size of a chocolate bar. Cowley had 3, and she could clutch them all in a single fist. These devices quite literally bring the power of modern genomics to the palm of your hand. And at a cost of just USD 1000, they herald a new era where sequencing moves away from well-equipped institutions and into places where it is most needed, from hospitals to epidemic-afflicted hot zones. Rather than sending samples from outbreak sites to special labs, scientists like Cowley will be able to take the labs to the outbreaks...more]

15 Sep 2015: Johns Hopkins' Ebola protective suit honored in Fast Company "Innovation by Design Awards"

Vaccine

15 Sep 2015: Experimental Ebola vaccine regimen takes new steps under HHS program
http://www.pharmacist.com/experimental-ebola-vaccine-regimen-takes-new-steps-under-hhs-program
[A 4-year, USD 28.5 million agreement between HHS [United States Health and Human Services] and Crucell Holland seeks to further the development of an experimental vaccine regimen against Ebola. The regimen being developed has 2 parts: a prime, Ad26.ZEBOV, made by Crucell Holland, and a boost, MVA-BN-Filo, made by Bavarian Nordic A/S.

Clinical studies of the Ebola prime-boost vaccine regimen were launched in the United States and the United Kingdom at the beginning of the year [2015], and a Phase II study began in July [2015]. Robin Robinson, director of HHS's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, the office that will manage the project, said: "History has shown that Ebola doesn't really disappear -- there have been roughly 35 outbreaks in the past 40 years -- so we need to be fully prepared for the future with licensed vaccines and therapies for this disease. By pursuing multiple Ebola vaccines and leveraging innovative technology, we can address biodefense needs here in the United States while spurring affordable options for global use."

The new agreement includes process optimization, characterization and validation of manufacturing processes; stability studies; fill-finish manufacturing; technology transfer between the 2 companies, and related activities. The deal can be extended for up 7 years and about USD 69 million.]

Liberia: Vanishing act - Several vehicles donated to fight Ebola gone
http://allafrica.com/stories/201509160893.html
[...President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, knowing the inability of her government to handle the outbreak, wrote the world in a touching letter appealing for support to fight the virus. The international community and local Liberian businesses responded promptly with massive donations of cash, vehicles, drugs and other materials to help curb the outbreak.

The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Government of China, Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA), and the Indian community in Liberia are just a few of the many donors providing vehicles, many of them brand new, to the government of Liberia. Just as the government received USD millions in cash, the number of vehicles donated to Liberia were so high that these vehicles were seen on every street corner and other parts of the country during the outbreak working to defeat the virus....

...Mary Broh, Director General of the General Services Agency, the entity responsible for managing government assets, on Tue [15 Sep 2015] told FrontPageAfrica that many of the vehicles used in the fight against the virus cannot be located. "Ministries and Agencies are unable to account for vehicles given them for the fight against Ebola," Director Broh said. She said that there exists a discrepancy between the recorded number of vehicles by GSA and the report submitted by the Internal Audit Agency based on findings from its recent audit...

...Madam Broh said, some of the vehicles that were intended to combat the virus are being commercialized. "GOL vehicles for Ebola were seen carrying passengers. No monitors on the cars, our fleet management is still in its infant stage," Broh added. She continued: "We are meeting to figure out where we have the problem; we will be asking questions; we gave out 317 vehicles, but the audit report from the Internal Audit Agency shows a little over 200 vehicles are available, we are still looking for the rest of the vehicles." ...more]
