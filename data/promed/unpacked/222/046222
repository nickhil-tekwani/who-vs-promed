ANTHRAX, HUMAN - NORWAY: RFI

From: Per Lausund <per.lausund@c2i.net>

The press (or rather, the media: with the strike we have in Norway at the
present time we thank God for nat-based news! This was from the Norwegian
Broadcasting Corp.) has reported that a drug addict (on IV heroin) died
some days ago from anthrax. It is reported that the heroin might have been
the source of the bacteria, but at the same time they warn drug abusers to
watch out for sores with black crusts and scabs. This sounds to me like
cutaneous anthrax. I would have expected the death to be caused by the
effect of IV injected bacteria/spores, but have no idea where these might
come from. We have not had a case of anthrax in Norway for several years,
and that was a cow. The last human death from anthrax in Norway was
supposedly sometime in the sixties (before I knew much about microbiology).
On the other hand, no more deaths or even infections have been reported,
and if this was in the drug abusers heroin it should affect more than one
person.
Anyone heard of similar cases? Recently?

[Thanks Per. Checking my records the last reported case of anthrax in
Norway was a cow in 1993: <http://www.vetmed.lsu.edu/whocc/mp_world.htm>
Logically this would have been a cutaneous case as such are relatively
straightforward to diagnose in humans; if from an i/v injection it would
have been a systemic infection and I doubt if the autopsy rate for dead
Norwegian drug addicts is high enough to have caught it. Or it could be,
yet again, a journalistic nonsense. Would those with hard information on
this case please share it? If there has been a recent livestock case the
Norwegian veterinary authorities should be aware of it. If this young man
worked in a knacker's yard (i.e. with dead stock, US 'renderer') it would
have been a missed case. - Mod. MHJ]
