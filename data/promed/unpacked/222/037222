Veterinary authorities have had to cull cattle infected with bovine tuberculosis at a dairy farm in eastern Belgium and are now testing animals at some 150 other farms, the Belgian food safety regulator said on Friday [7 Aug 2015].

Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial disease of cattle that occasionally affects other mammal species. It can spread to humans through the ingestion of unpasteurised milk.

"For the moment the investigation is limited to Belgium but I don't exclude expanding this investigation abroad if needed," a spokesman for regulator FAVV said.

The spokesman did not say how many sick cows had been put down at the affected farm. He said investigators were testing cattle elsewhere because they were believed to have had some contact with the affected dairy farm.

Authorities have banned the transfer of animals from the farms under investigation until the results are back, the spokesman added.

Controlling bovine tuberculosis is especially difficult in areas where cows can come into contact with wildlife.

In 2013 British authorities culled thousands of badgers in southwest England to halt the spread of the disease. Similar efforts were made in New Zealand where possums are blamed for passing the disease to cattle.

Bovine tuberculosis is now rare in Belgium, though there were 9 cases in 2013, state broadcaster RTBF reported.

[Some complementary information has become available from a report dated 7 Aug 2015 on the regional web-site Sudinfo, south Belgium, in French, translated by Corr.SB, from which we extracted the following main points:
1. The outbreak involves a dairy farm in Meeuwen, in the Belgian province Limburg.
2. Some 150 other farms have been put under quarantine due to contact with the infected farm. This number of farm shutdowns could rise further, while the inspections are ongoing.
3. The shutdown operations are mainly in Limburg, but some are also in the rest of the country, as close as Antwerp or Liege.
4. Affected holdings must undertake the tuberculine test on animals within 30 days.
5. Belgium has been officially free from tuberculosis for 10 years, though sporadic cases still occur.

The requirements for a country to qualify as free from bTB are stipulated in OIE's terrestrial Code, article 11.6.2., available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.11.6.htm. As long as the country maintains its bTB-freedom in at least 99.8 per cent of the herds and 99.9 per cent of the cattle, its national bTB-free status recognition is maintained. - Mod.AS
