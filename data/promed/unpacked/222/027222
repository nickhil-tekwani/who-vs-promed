An Afghan health official said that a child has been infected with polio in the Nawzad district of Helmand. Mr. Abdul Shukur Nasrat, the vice-president of the South Coast [?], told the US Voice of America that the family of this child lives in the eastern province of Helmand, which is in the control of the government's armed opponents. "The polio-[affected] child [is 4] years old [and has received vaccine only 2 times a year]," he said.

In addition to the UN Assistance Mission for Children in Afghanistan (UNICEF), polio spokesperson Syed Kamal Shah told the US Voice of America that the risk of polio virus is high [in this area], and the vaccine should be regularly reaching the children. "Every time and during every campaign, the targeted children should be vaccinated against polio, even if they have received anti-polio drops [in the past] or not, because the poliovirus is in [this zone], and it can help other children's health as well."

Syed Kamal Shah added that the polio virus vaccine can be taken at the time when religious scholars, tribal leaders, and family members will make a wide range of assistance in implementing polio vaccine.

Since January 2018, Afghanistan has had 8 cases of polio reported in Kandahar, 3 in Kunar, 2 in Nangarhar, 1 in Uruzgan, and 2 incidents also registered in Helmand province.

[Once the virus has been further identified, this will become the 16th confirmed case of polio reported by Afghanistan during 2018. I suspect further details will become available with time, especially the date of onset of illness, a good indicator of the sensitivity of the surveillance system.

Unfortunately, the quality of the machine translation was less than ideal, so I've tried to edit, using my best guess what was intended here. If I've erred, my apologies in advance for any misleading information.

Helmand province is in the south of Afghanistan bordered by Kandahar to its east (where there have been other WPV1 cases reported) and Pakistan to its south. Note that Helmand province is mentioned as an area with civil unrest that has impeded vaccination activities in the area. - Mod.MPP]

Headlines
Summary of newly-reported viruses this week:
- No new cases of wild poliovirus [WPV] and 5 new cases of cVDPV;
- Niger - one new case of cVDPV2;
- Nigeria - 2 new cases of cVDPV2;
- Somalia - one new case of cVDPV2;
- Papua New Guinea - one new case of cVDPV1.

- Positive samples from environmental surveillance:
- WPVin Pakistan (10);
- cVDPV2 in Somalia (1)

Afghanistan
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week; the most recent case had onset of paralysis on [27 Aug 2018], from Kandahar. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 is 15, more than twice the number at this time last year [2017].
- No new WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week.

Pakistan
- No new cases of WPV1 were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 is 4.
- 10 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week from across the country, collected in September [2018].

Nigeria
- 2 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported this week, bringing the total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 to 16.
- These latest reported cases had onset of paralysis in late August [2018] and mid- September [2018], from Katsina and Borno states, linked to the cVDPV2 outbreak centred around Jigawa.
- No cases of WPV1 were reported. The most recently detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- In response to cVDPV2 detection, the country continues to conduct acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance-strengthening activities, including enhanced active surveillance visits and community sampling. The programme has also carried out an extensive search for type 2-containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus is detected.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad Basin
- One case of cVDPV2 was reported from Niger, genetically linked to a cVDPV2 in Jigawa, Nigeria, with onset of paralysis on [14 Aug 2018], from Zinder province. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 is 3, all from Zinder province. These cases are linked to a cVDPV2 in Jigawa, Nigeria.
- The government of Niger has declared a national public-health emergency, as per the temporary recommendations of the Emergency Committee of the International Health Regulations.
- WHO and its partners are supporting local public-health authorities in field investigations and risk assessment, and to conduct additional response measures as appropriate and necessary. Health workers are conducting active searches for additional AFP cases; surveillance is also being strengthened by taking more environmental samples from more areas and sampling the stools of healthy people.
- The detection of WPV1 and cVDPV2 in Nigeria continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad Basin. Emergency outbreak response and efforts to improve surveillance continue across the basin. These include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons and refugee camps, and at international borders.

Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo)
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week.
- DR Congo is affected by 3 separate strains of cVDPV2, in the provinces of Mongala, Maniema, and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- The relevant provincial governors have signed a Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication, committing to providing the necessary oversight, accountability, and resources needed to stop the outbreak. It is hoped that level of oversight will improve operational performance of the outbreak response.
- The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously with an ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner.

Horn of Africa
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 and type 3 (cVDPV2 and cVDPV3), reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- One new case of cVDPV2 was reported in the past week from Lower Juba, Somalia, with onset of paralysis on [2 Sep 2018]. A positive environmental sample of cVDPV2 was reported from Banadir.
- The country is carrying out outbreak response to both virus types in line with internationally agreed guidelines. An Outbreak Response Assessment is due to start on [18 Nov 2018], followed by a Technical Advisory Group meeting.

Papua New Guinea
- One new case of cVDPV1 was reported in the past week from East Sepik. Onset of paralysis was on [1 Aug 2018]. This brings the total number of cases in 2018 to 15. Two cVDPV1-positive environmental samples, both collected on [5 Sep 2018], were reported from Port Moresby.
- Emergency operations centres are established and operational in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- Three supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nationwide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15 due to the large numbers of poorly immunized older children.
- Detection and reporting of new viruses or cases at this point in the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected, as surveillance is being strengthened, and most reported and confirmed cases had onset of paralysis prior to the start of comprehensive outbreak response.

Middle East
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week in Syria. The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 remains 74. There are no cases reported in 2018. The most recent case (by date of onset of paralysis) was reported in Boukamal district, with onset on [21 Sep 2017].

[Another week's surveillance information, and the situation remains somewhat the same: continued transmission of cVDPVs (circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses) in multiple countries (Nigeria, Niger, Somalia, and Papua New Guinea), and while no new WPV1 (wild poliovirus type 1) have been officially confirmed (see section [1] above for a Pashto media report announcing a newly confirmed case of WPV1 in Helmand Province), there were 10 environmental samples taken during the month of September in Pakistan that were positive for the WPV1. Hence, the absence of officially reported/confirmed cases does not signal interruption of transmission in either Pakistan or Afghanistan.

For a map showing the locations of cases of WPV and cVDPV, see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. - Mod.MPP
