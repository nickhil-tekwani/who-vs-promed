European collaboration identifies an outbreak of Escherichia coli O157
infection in visitors to Fuerteventura, Canary Islands:
-------------------------------------------------------
Finland
-------
Two children from Finland, who became ill on 19 March [1997] and developed
haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), had stayed at a hotel in the resort
of Corralejo, Fuerteventura, Canary Islands, between 6 and 19 March
1997. The health authorities in Finland notified the department of
public health in the Canary Islands on 25 March. All members of the
European surveillance network for salmonellosis and Vero cytotoxin
producing Escherichia coli infection ("Salm/ Enter-net") were contacted.
United Kingdom
--------------
Two cases of E. coli O157 infection, in a couple who had visited
Fuerteventura from 12 to 19 March, were reported by a public health
laboratory on 1 April 1997 to the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance
Centre (CDSC), as part of the PHLS national case control study of E.
coli O157 infection. The PHLS Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens (LEP)
reported two other cases to CDSC. An electronic message was sent to all
consultants in communicable disease control and directors of public
health laboratories in England and Wales, and a further two cases were
identified. All six cases had stayed at a second hotel in Corralejo.
Five became ill between 3 and 20 March; the sixth case could not give a
date of onset because of a chronic bowel complaint. E. coli O157 was
isolated from five of these cases. LEP has confirmed that the five
isolates are E. coli O157 phage type (PT) 2, Vero cytotoxin type 2, and
are indistinguishable in other tests including resistance to
antimicrobial agents.
Active case finding in the Canary Islands revealed two other cases in
visitors. One from England developed bloody diarrhoea and vomiting (not
yet microbiologically confirmed).
Sweden
------
The other was a 5 year old child from Sweden who became ill on 28 March
(microbiologically confirmed).
These two cases stayed at a third hotel in Corralejo.
Denmark
-------
The authorities in Denmark reported a case of HUS in a 4 year old who became
ill on 29
March.
The child and other members of the family stayed in Corralejo at
the same hotel as the cases from Finland. An isolate of E. coli O157
from the child was sent to LEP and is PT2, with the same resistance
pattern as the other five isolates.

Spain (Canary Islands)
----------------------
No cases have been reported in the local population of Corralejo.
Detailed histories taken from eight cases in England, Wales, and Finland
have revealed no food source, drinking water, eating or swimming
patterns common to all cases. The three hotels all used untreated
non-potable water from a private well. This well was apparently
uncapped, with goats and other animals nearby. Distribution of water
from this well ceased on 29 March.
