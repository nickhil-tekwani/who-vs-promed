Common mosquitoes have already caused 5 deaths
----------------------------------------------
5 persons died in Cordoba between February and April 2005 because of a viral
disease transmitted by common mosquitoes, confirmed the Provincial Ministry
of Health.

The fatal disease was a viral encephalitis produced by a type of virus
called flavivirus, which is transmitted through the bite of the common
mosquito (_Culex pipiens_). Meanwhile, it is being studied whether this
virus may also be transmitted by the mosquito vectors for dengue and malaria
[_Aedes spp._ and _Anopheles spp._, respectively. - Mod.JGM].

Data was sent to La Voz del Interior by the Epidemiology Directorate at the
Provincial Ministry of Health. It was also reported that, to date, 59
encephalitis cases likely caused by flavivirus have been detected in the
province, affecting mainly adults living in Cordoba, the capital city. 4 of
the deceased persons were elderly people from Cordoba; the remaining one was
a woman from the interior of the province.

Provincial health authorities consider that although some additional cases
may be reported this month [May 2005], it is expected that cases will
diminish in the upcoming cold season -- when the number of mosquitoes is
markedly reduced -- but cases may reappear next spring.

Encephalitis is a rare disease among acute febrile syndromes and consists of
a cerebral inflammation that in some cases may be very severe, leading to
neurological sequelae and even death. The disease is more severe in children
and infants, as well as in the elderly.

There is no vaccine to prevent this disease, so that the only way to avoid
its transmission is by controlling the mosquito population.

According to epidemiological data, the disease mainly affected adults more
than 60 years old, most of them living in Cordoba, the capital city; the
remaining persons were from Colon and Rio Segundo departments.

"At first, the disease occurred in elderly patients, who developed
complications, but later the disease occurred in younger people and even in
children," said Maria Frias, Head of Epidemiology, who also stated that the
last case was reported last month [April 2005].

4 of the deceased persons were more than 70 years old and had other
underlying diseases, and the other one was a 25-year-old woman, a native of
the department of Colon, without history of any previous illness.

On the other hand, cases in Cordoba were related to mosquito bites within
the provincial territory, implying that there is circulation of insects
infected with the virus.

Maria Frias stated that there are 34 confirmed cases of flavivirus infection
and another 25 cases awaiting confirmation.

Flaviviruses cause infections in humans, some of which may have an
asymptomatic course. Yellow fever, dengue fever, and certain types of
encephalitis, such as Saint Louis encephalitis, are among these infections.
These viruses are transmitted when a mosquito feeds on the blood of infected
birds or mammals and afterward bites a human.

In Cordoba, according to the Epidemiology service, infected animals have
already been detected.

"Within this context, what people have to know is that, contrary to what is
currently thought, mosquitoes transmit diseases that may be severe;
therefore, it is important to control the mosquito population", emphasized
Roberto Chuit, Provincial Health Minister.

"There is no reason to be alarmed; we have to be alert and control mosquito
proliferation," underscored the Health Minister, who pointed out that
encephalitis cases detected in Cordoba indicate an emerging disease, so it
is beginning to be reported within the provincial territory.

"Additionally, when dealing with symptoms compatible with encephalitis, it
is important to seek medical assistance immediately, since early care
improves prognosis", he said.

Maria Frias also recommended that home measures for mosquito control be
intensified, since the arthropods are still abundant this time of year.

"We should be clear that the only way to prevent this disease is avoiding
mosquito bites. This is the reason we must prevent mosquitoes from breeding
and living in our houses", emphasized the Health Officer.

In Cordoba, these cases were detected through the epidemiological
surveillance system in the Province, which detected a significant incidence
of viral encephalitis (84 cases as of April 2005).

"We studied what virus types caused the disease, and it was determined that
there was a wide occurrence of flavivirus encephalitis. Now we are trying to
identify a specific viral agent for which mosquitoes are the vector and to
determine what happens to birds and mammals that may act as intermediate
hosts", reported Roberto Chuit.

Simultaneously, in a national context, an increase in encephalitis has been
observed, [but] no additional studies to determine its origin have been
performed. "This is the reason there are no reports indicating the presence
of encephalitis in other regions of the country, which does not mean that
there are no cases; the point is that the cases are not being looked for",
authorities said.

Nevertheless, the issue was the main topic in a meeting convened some days
ago by the Provincial Ministry of health, attended by virology experts from
different institutions in Cordoba and Delia Enria, Head of the Julio
Maiztegui National Institute for Viral Diseases in Humans in Pergamino, in
order to undertake an analysis and study of cases reported in Cordoba, and
to determine the steps to be taken.

[More than 70 pathogens are classified in the order Flaviviridae. The
word "flavi" is from "flavus", a Latin word meaning "yellow", because the
type species of flavivirus is yellow fever virus.

I tend to agree with Jack Woodall, ProMED Moderator and an expert in this
field, that Cordoba is beyond the yellow fever belt. This outbreak is more
likely to be due to Rocio virus, or given the age spectrum, even West Nile
virus. Among the other flaviviruses are the agents causing dengue fever
(types 1, 2, 3 & 4), St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, Murray
Valley or Kunjin, tick-borne encephalitis, Kyasanur Forest disease, Omsk
hemorrhagic fever, louping ill, Powassan, and hepatitis C.

Of these, West Nile virus is most closely related to St. Louis encephalitis
virus, cases of which predate West Nile fever cases in the USA, which have
only been seen there for the past 6 years since 1999. West Nile virus may
infect humans, mosquitoes, birds, horses, and certain other mammals.

The Argentinean health authorities are currently searching for a specific
viral agent responsible for the outbreak of flaviviral encephalitis and the
related mosquito vectors. They are also investigating whether birds and
other mammals are involved. ProMED requests further information from anyone
familiar with the situation in that area. - Mod.RY]

[On 5 Apr 2005 this same source ran a story which included the sentence: "In
the 1st 3 months of this year [2005], Cordoba registered 32 cases of the so-
called St Louis encephalitis." It will be recalled that the 1st cases of
West Nile virus in the USA (in 1999) were intially misdiagnosed by
laboratory testing as St Louis encephalitis. A check of the Spanish language
website today does not show any more recent report. - Mod.JW]
