Tomato yellow leaf curl virus has affected between 20 and 50 percent
of the area under tomato cultivation in the region of Nijar and has
already forced the uprooting of some 200 hectares of plantings, the
Organizaciones de Agricultores y Ganaderos (COAG) announced.

According to COAG, there has been fraud on the part of some companies
providing seeds. The majority of affected farmers had planted seeds
that allegedly were resistant to this virus. The seed companies
refuse responsibility, claiming that the seed lines were "tolerant
rather than resistant and that, therefore, they may or may not be affected."

COAG notes that "the problem could be extended in the coming weeks to
the rest of the tomato crops in the province if we fail to tackle the
problem in time."

[_Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_ (TYLCV; genus _Begomovirus_)
originates from the Middle East and is one of the most damaging
viruses of tomato worldwide. It can also affect a number of other
solanaceous and leguminous hosts. Symptoms on tomato include small
chlorotic puckered leaves and stunting of plants. Yield losses of up
to 80 percent have been reported. The virus is transmitted in a
persistent manner by the silverleaf whitefly (_Bemisia tabaci_
biotype B), which in itself is a serious pest of tomatoes and other
vegetable crops. TYLCV can also be transmitted by mechanical
inoculation (poorly) and by grafting, but is not transmitted by seed
or contact between plants.

Disease management may include use of certified vector and virus free
planting material, cultural practices, and removal of infected crop
residues and possible pathogen and/or vector reservoirs to reduce
inoculum. Control of the vector is most important, but this may cause
problems of chemical residues on the fruit and is extremely difficult
in open field situations due to the widespread presence and wide host
range of the vector. Field cropping of tomatoes has been abandoned in
some areas due to TYLCV. Tomato cultivars with increased levels of
resistance or tolerance are available. Transgenic tomato plants
incorporating TYLCV capsid protein genes have been found to be
resistant to the virus.

The term virus resistance indicates that host plants will not get
infected, and virus replication will not take place, while virus
tolerance means that they can get infected but this will not lead to
symptom development and/or yield losses. Both resistance and
tolerance may occur at complete or partial levels and may also be
overcome by new viral strains. While the problem reported above may
well be due to a mistake by seed suppliers as is being claimed, the
emergence of a new viral strain resulting in resistance breakdown can
also not be excluded.
