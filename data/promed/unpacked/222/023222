Greyhound death toll in state hits 10
---------------------------------
The death count has risen to 10 in the mysterious respiratory illness
that has swept through greyhound dog tracks across the state, a
racing official confirmed Wednesday.
While the sickness seems to be waning in the northern part of the
state, it seems to have had "a little bit of a rebirth" in the
southern part of the state, said David Roberts, director of the state
Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering.
Palm Beach and the Naples/Fort Myers track have been hardest hit in
the south, Roberts said.
But Larry Mosher, Naples/Fort Myers racing track secretary, said
Wednesday that the worst is over at his track at 10601 Bonita Beach
Road in Bonita Springs.
"We are 3/4 of the way through it, as far as the dogs that are sick,"
Mosher said.
400-500 greyhounds at the track are ready to go back to racing,
Mosher said. The track has about 800 greyhounds owned by 12 separate
kennels.
One of the 10 greyhound deaths occurred at the Naples/Fort Myers
Track. One occurred at the Palm Beach track; 2 happened at the Derby
Lane track in St. Petersburg; and 6 occurred at the Sanford/Orlando
track, Roberts said.
Cynda Crawford, the University of Florida veterinarian who is leading
a team of veterinary virologists investigating the outbreak, will go
to the Sanford/Orlando track today to pick up more dog carcasses and
take tests, Roberts said.
So far, the deaths point to a kind of pneumonia, Roberts said.
Racing officials are still referring to the illness as respiratory,
and are no longer calling it a "kennel cough."
The illness has resulted in the loss of 670 races for the tracks
affected across the state, Roberts said.
At the Naples/Fort Myers track, 40 races have been lost because of
the sickness, Mosher said.
The track is still running on a "condensed" schedule, and is
canceling a Saturday matinee performance this week.
But next week, the Naples/Fort Myers track will be back to its full,
regular schedule, Mosher said. That includes racing Wednesday through
Saturday this time of year.

[Dr. Crawford is among those whose research may indicate that this is
a case of equine influenza. If this is the case, it would be the 1st
time the equine flu may have crossed species barriers. This research
is ongoing and is still only suggestive.
More information regarding the crossing of the species barrier may be
found in DVM Magazine. The magazine carries an online article on Dr.
Crawford's research:
