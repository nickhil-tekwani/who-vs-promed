Reports of higher than normal cases of an infectious intestinal disease in
Hampden County have prompted health officials to urge precautions be taken
by day care centers, camps and food vendors.
The disease, called shigellosis, can cause flu-like symptoms including
diarrhea, fever and vomiting. The main preventative measure is careful hand
washing after using the toilet.
A total of 24 cases about four times the number that would have been
expected have been reported this summer from six Hampden County
communities, including Springfield, Dr. Bela T. Mayas, medical director of
the state Bureau of Communicable Disease Control, said Friday.
So far, all of the Hampden County cases have involved person-to-person
contact within families or small groups, he said. The risk to the public is
much less with that type of outbreak than when the disease spreads through
infected food or drinking water.
However, he said, public health officials are moving aggressively to
control the outbreak while it is still small.
"It's the kind of disease that can move very fast," Mayas said. "And even
with a person-to-person spread each new case could potentially be a food
handler."
A similar outbreak in 1991 ended up sickening more than 1000 people in the
county and was carried by victims to other states, he said.
Hampden County is currently the only region of the state where there is an
outbreak of shigellosis, he said.
