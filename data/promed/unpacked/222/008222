The Pasteur Institute in Algiers has confirmed that the deaths of 3 people attributed to a strange, undiagnosed respiratory infection were the result of seasonal flu virus infection.

According to hospital sources, the undiagnosed respiratory infection responsible for the deaths of 3 people, general panic, and the admission of others to the intensive care unit at Omar Jilali Infectious Diseases Hospital were consequences of seasonal influenza virus infection. Samples of blood from others have been taken for further analysis.

[ProMED-mail thanks Gert van der Hoek for this rapid response to our request for information.

According to the current WHO Global Influenza Update, released on 1 Feb 2013, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 is the predominant influenza virus in the area and likely to be responsible for the outbreak of respiratory disease in Algeria. - Mod.CP
