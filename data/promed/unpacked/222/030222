[The BTV-8 event reportedly started on 8 Dec 2018 in Germany's southwestern state of Baden-Wurttemberg [BW], bordering French and Swiss territories in which BTV-8 reportedly had been circulating during 2017 and 2018. The infection was initially detected during a routine inspection in a dairy cattle farm in Ottersweier (Rastatt district); see ProMED-mail archive no. 20181213.6208137. This was followed by the setting up of a large restricted zone in southwest Germany, covering the entire state of Baden-Wurttemberg, all of Saarland, and southern parts of Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse.

Since then, the BTV-8 infection in cattle has been confirmed in additional cattle farms, presenting a spread northward, entering the states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland. A new follow-up report (no. 4) of the German event was submitted to the OIE on Thu 17 Jan 2019, adding 2 new outbreaks in BW (see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=29233).

As of Thu 17 Jan 2019, a total of 19 BTV-8 outbreaks in cattle have been identified and reported by Germany to the OIE, with the following summarized epidemiological statistics:
Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
2534 / 27 / 2 / 1 / 0

No information on the clinical condition of the positive animals has become available, though in one outbreak, on the premises of a cattle dealer in Wincheringen (Rheinland-Pfalz, Trier-Saarburg), where 157 susceptible animals were kept, 2 animals reportedly died on 8 Jan 2019, and a 3rd affected animal was culled. It will be interesting to note what clinical signs and gross pathological changes were recorded (outbreak 3 at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=29187).

According to unofficial, reliable information, most positive animals in Germany are young stock kept on the premises of their birth. If confirmed, this may be indicative of a recent virus (and vectors?) circulation, which is exceptional or at least unusual during the winter season. The extremely low morbidity rate is also puzzling, unless most animals are vaccinants or maintain maternal antibodies.

The possible activity of culicoids in the affected region (3 countries) deserves to be investigated. - Mod.AS
