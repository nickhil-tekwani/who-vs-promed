It might be interesting to know what a large domestic user - the US Army, for
example - pays for a dose of hepatitis A vaccine. My impression was that this
large-scale buyer had negotiated a very favorable price for hepatitis B
vaccine, [a price that is] much less than that generally available in the
civilian world. Of course, legal fees associated with military vaccination
programs are probably considerably less.

[Why would you think that "legal fees associated with military vaccination
programs are probably considerably less" (than civilian fees)?
