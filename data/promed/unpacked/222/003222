2000/156 First report of cucurbit yellow stunting disorder closterovirus in
Morocco [edited
----------------------------
[In 1999 severe yellowing symptoms were observed in a melon crop (_Cucumis
melo_) grown under plastic tunnels near Agadir. Cucurbit yellow stunting
disorder closterovirus (CYSDV, EPPO Alert List) was detected in symptomatic
plants. This is the first report of this virus in Morocco. The situation
of cucurbit yellow stunting disorder closterovirus in Morocco can be
described as present, only in some areas (near Agadir).
