[2] Summary
- Fri 27 Sep 2019
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/09/who-29-new-ebola-cases-past-week-down-57-week
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

According to the latest update from the World Health Organization (WHO), daily Ebola case counts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have dropped nearly by half in the past few weeks, but violent skirmishes may be obscuring more cases.

In an outbreak news update yesterday [Thu 26 Sep 2019], the WHO said officials confirmed 29 cases this past week, compared with 57 the week before.

"This decrease in the number of cases should be interpreted with caution, as operational and security challenges in certain health zones make it difficult to undertake case detection and response functions," the WHO said in its latest update on the 13-month-long outbreak in North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri provinces.

A recent increase in security incidents has caused problems with surveillance, the WHO said.

For the past 9 days response activity has been stopped in Lwemba, within Mandima health zone, which has limited contact-tracing efforts, with 169 and 162 contacts lost to follow-up in Lwemba and Mambasa, respectively.

"After more than a week with no response operations in Lwemba Health Area, within Mandima Health Zone, an increase in the number of reported cases is expected in the coming weeks as response activities resume," the WHO said.

Mambasa, Mandima, and Kalunguta remain the outbreak hot spots. In the past 3 weeks, the DRC recorded 126 confirmed cases from 13 health zones.

The case-fatality rate of the outbreak remains at 67%, with 56% of confirmed or probable cases in females, and 28% of cases involving children. Health workers represent 5% of cases (161).

Three new cases today
Today the WHO's Ebola dashboard shows 3 new cases, raising the outbreak total to 3183, including 2126 deaths. A total of 482 suspected cases are still under investigation.

In the latest daily update from the DRC's multisector Ebola committee (CMRE), the group said the 3 new cases confirmed yesterday were in Mandima (2) and Mambasa (1).

Vaccination continues throughout the region, with 228 430 people vaccinated as of yesterday, the CMRE said.

[3] Response
- Mon 30 Sep 2019. Tanzania: warning
[Ars Technica (abridged, edited)]
https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/09/possible-cover-up-of-ebola-outbreak-in-tanzania-prompts-travel-warnings/
[Byline: Beth Mole]

US and UK government officials are warning travelers of the possibility of a concealed Ebola outbreak in Tanzania after the World Health Organization reported that the government there is withholding information about possible cases of the deadly virus.

On [21 Sep 2019], the WHO released an unusual statement outlining a series of unofficial reports from the country. The first was that a doctor who had recently traveled to Uganda had returned to Tanzania with a "suspected" case of Ebola. Testing performed by the Tanzanian National Health Laboratory reportedly indicated that the doctor was positive for the virus. She died on [8 Sep 2019] in Dar es Salaam, the largest city in Tanzania, after traveling extensively throughout the country. Subsequent unofficial reports to the WHO indicated that there were several other suspected cases as well as contacts in quarantine in various sites in Tanzania.

The Tanzanian government has said that there have been no cases of Ebola and that no suspected cases are "admitted anywhere" in the country. But officials there have been remarkably slow to respond to the WHO's requests for information, have failed to provide critical details about the cases, have not offered alternative explanations for the illnesses and death, and have refused to perform confirmatory tests to ensure that the disease is not spreading, according to the WHO.

While the WHO ultimately determined that there is too little information to justify travel and trade restrictions at this point, US and UK government officials are now warning travelers of the possibility that the virus is spreading unchecked in the country.

The US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department updated their travel advisories for Tanzania late Fri 27 Sep. The CDC's warning briefly summarizes the situation outlined by the WHO, noting that the doctor who died had a "probable" case of Ebola, and that she had traveled through several cities, including Songea, Njombe, and Mbeya.

The agency warned that "travelers should remain aware of the situation and avoid direct contact with people who are ill, when possible. They should also monitor themselves for symptoms of EVD [Ebola virus disease] (fever, severe headache, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, unexplained bruising or bleeding) both during and for 3 weeks after travel."

As noted by STAT news, the UK government also updated its travel advice to warn of the possibility of Ebola in Tanzania.

The UK's warning notes that the WHO declared the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in July 2019 and that cases have spilled over to Uganda.

[Also see https://www.statnews.com/2019/09/27/ebola-tanzania-travelers-alerted-to-possible-unreported-cases/ [Byline: Helen Branswell]:
The governments of the United States and the United Kingdom are alerting their citizens to the possibility that there may be unreported Ebola cases in Tanzania.

The information -- posted on the websites of the U.S. State Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office -- relates to concerning reports that a Tanzanian doctor who had been in Uganda in August 2019 and who died after her return home may have tested positive for Ebola.

The U.S. updates were posted [Fri 27 Sep 2019]; it is unclear when the Foreign and Commonwealth Office added the warning to its webpage detailing travel advice for Tanzania. [...]

Under the International Health Regulations, a global treaty to which Tanzania is a signatory, countries are obliged to notify the WHO immediately when they have outbreaks of serious infectious diseases that could pose a risk to their neighbors and the wider world. In exchange for meeting the obligation to report, the treaty protects countries with disease outbreaks by instructing other nations not to take actions to restrict trade or travel.

The WHO has been publicly silent about the matter since it issued the statement on [21 Sep 2019]. But sources tell STAT the WHO and some national governments have been trying to get the Tanzanian government to be more forthcoming with information, using the opportunity of the United Nations General Assembly to push for transparency.[...]

"The ongoing risks from this event are unknown, but at this time and based on available information (which is incomplete), no travel restrictions to Tanzania are indicated," the CDC said.] -- Communicated by Mary Marshall <mjm2020@googlemail.com>

The ArsTechnica report states "Testing performed by the Tanzanian National Health Laboratory reportedly indicated that the doctor was positive for the virus" ; however, the report that was released to the public indicated the test was negative for Ebola. It is not to Tanzania's benefit not to share specimens with the appropriate labs or release raw data on test results. It is hoped that the country demonstrates transparency to clarify the situation. In the meantime, the US and UK have taken the appropriate measures to protect the public. - Mod.LK]

- Sun 9 Sep 2019. Tanzania (Tanganyika): training
[Radio Okapi (abridged, edited)]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2019/09/29/actualite/sante/tanganyika-50-inspecteurs-et-agents-de-lepsp-formes-sur-la-lutte-contre

A total of 50 inspectors and officers from the Division of Primary, Secondary and Vocational Education and Health are trained in the fight against Ebola. This training [was] held [Sun 29 Sep 2019] in Kongolo in the province of Tanganyika. They also benefited from training on cholera and polio in the area.

"The training is for Inspectors to train teachers on the fight against 3 diseases: Ebola, cholera and polio. Not only through schools and across communities, "said EPSP-Kongolo 1 sub-division chief, Delphin Mwenge bin Pungu.

A team of 4 trainers from Kinshasa provide training for 10 days. "The teachers are there, the children are in the families, in the community and the message can go well because it is almost the majority of the population of the communities," added Delphin Mwenge bin Pungu

He invited all participants to sensitize all sections of the population to take precautions against Ebola. "We hear about Ebola but we do not know how Ebola can be transmitted, how Ebola can ravage part of the population. It can ravage even a whole country, "continued Delphin Mwenge bin Pungu.]

[4] Vaccines
-Mon 30 Sep 2019: Japan clinical trial
[Precision Vaccinations (abridged, edited)]
https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/uw-madison-ebola-vaccine-candidate-whole-virus-vaccine-using-7-8-genes-make-ebola-virus
[Byline: Don Ward Hackett]

Another Ebola Disease virus vaccine candidate will be used in a limited phase 1 clinical trial expected to start in Japan during December 2019, said a UW-Madison researcher.

This is potentially good news since there is no approved vaccine for the Ebola Zaire disease today. This experimental Ebola vaccine, developed in the lab of UW-Madison scientist Yoshihiro Kawaoka, was produced at Waisman Biomanufacturing, a specialized center at the university's Waisman Center. The vaccine uses a technology created a decade ago by Peter Halfmann, a scientist in Kawaoka's lab.

The technology has been safely used to study the virus, identify potential drugs against it and make the vaccine, according to a UW-Madison article published on 30 Sep 2019. In 2015, Kawaoka reported that the vaccine protected monkeys from Ebola virus infection in experiments conducted at a high-level containment facility in Montana.

Other Ebola vaccine candidates use vector viruses to deliver a single Ebola protein to the immune system.

The UW-Madison version, considered a "whole-virus" vaccine, uses 7 of the 8 genes that make up the Ebola virus. The UW-Madison vaccine is missing a key protein, and can grow only in special cells engineered to contain the protein, the university said.

In this pending phase 1 study involving 30 participants, 15 people will get a low dose of the vaccine and 15 people will get a high dose, said Kawaoka, who also works at the University of Tokyo, located in Japan.

If the vaccine is found to be safe and effective, a larger study will be conducted in Africa, where Ebola outbreaks have occurred in recent years, including a current outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

There are 2 experimental Ebola vaccine candidates being tested in the DRC and Uganda. Merck's V920 (rVSVAG-ZEBOV-GP) a recombinant, replication-competent Ebola vaccine and Jannsen's Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN a heterologous prime-boost Ebola vaccine regimen is currently being tested on local populations in Africa.

And, the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority said it will provide funding and expertise to Ridgeback Biotherapeutics to manufacture the Ebola therapeutic, mAb114.
