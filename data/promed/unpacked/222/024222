List readers in North America (and other areas) may be interested to
dig up the most recent issue of the Canadian Veterinary Journal, in
which a case report of the first case of BSE is presented (Chen et al.
1996 "Bovine spongiform encephalopathy identified in a cow imported to
Canada from the United Kingdom - A case report." CVJ (January) 37:38-40.)

The report details confirmation of BSE in a 7 year old Saler cow
imported to Canada from the UK in early 1987. This was one of several
cows under observation by Ag Canada officials since 1990. The cow was
found recumbent in November 1993, and BSE was diagnosed by ADRI labs
in Nepean, near Ottawa. This diagnosis was confirmed by Weybridge UK.
Full details are in the case report.

Other rule outs (which I would have thought more probable) included
Haemophilus somnus and our old nemesis rabies. The report also includes
2 H&E sections showing vacuolation and spongiform change in the brainstem.

As the authors suggest, this is a bit of a worry for Western beef producers
since, as anyone who has worked cow calf in the winter in Western Canada
will tell you, you just don't see the old girls very much in the winter
time. Ag Canada has initiated a control and monitoring program because of
this.

I am not associated with the authors; just thought this article would be of
interest to the list readers.

[- Agriculture Canada has had a very aggressive proactive programme in
relation to imported British cattle. In general they have tended towards
the slaughter of these animals before the onset of any signs. There is
active surveillance in both Canada and the USA for animals with BSE-like
signs. Martin Hugh-Jones, ProMED-AHEAD Moderator]
