Dracunculiasis & onchocerciasis - Sudan:
In March 1995, the Government of Sudan announced a cease-fire to permit
acceleration of efforts to eradicate dracunculiasis, control
onchocerciasis, and deal with certain other health problems. This report
summarizes the achievements of health workers on both sides and of other
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in implementing control measures
against dracunculiasis and onchocerciasis in Sudan since March 1995.
WER Editorial Note (WHO Collaborating Center for Research, Training and
Eradication of Dracunculiasis, Atlanta): Since the 1995 "Guinea-Worm
Cease-Fire", Sudanese health workers on both sides, with the help of some
external donors and technical assistance, have made remarkable progress
towards the common goals of eradicating dracunculiasis and controlling
onchocerciasis in Sudan, despite severe constraints, including widespread
strife, poor or absent infrastructure (personnel, facilities, roads,
communications), limited logistical capacity, a long rainy season, and
inadequate funding. Some areas known to be endemic for dracunculiasis
and/or onchocerciasis have still not been assessed. Partly because of the
disruption and population movements, the transmission of dracunculiasis,
and probably also onchocerciasis, may now be more intensive in some areas
of southern Sudan than anywhere else in the world.
