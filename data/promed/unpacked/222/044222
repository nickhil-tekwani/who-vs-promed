An unusual outbreak of peritonitis caused by _Achromobacter xylosoxidans_
subsp. _xylosoxidans_ affected 5 patients (4 women, 1 man) undergoing
continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) at the Clinica Santa
Sofia, Caracas about 4 months ago. The mean age of the patients was 38
years, plus or minus 13 years. All had chronic terminal renal
insufficiency, due to diabetic glomerulopathy (2), other causes of chronic
glomerulopathy (2), and unknown reasons (1).

The patients were under a regimen of dialysis of 2 liters every 6 hours.
All of them received the material required for the dialysis procedure from
the same distributor, which recently had begun to provide the patients with
a locally manufactured commercial antiseptic ammonium derivative containing
an aqueous 10 per cent solution of Lauryl dimethyl-benzyl-Ammonium Bromide
for the manipulation of catheters and other dialysis material at home.

The patients had received CAPD for an average of 12.3 months (plus or minus
8 months). At the moment of occurrence of the outbreak, the patients had
neither evidence of infection in the exit site nor tunnelitis. One patient
had experienced one previous episode of peritonitis by _Staphylococcus
epidermidis _ about 6 months earlier. All patients had severe generalized
abdominal pain and noticed a very cloudy dialysate effluent.

In each of the 5 patients' peritoneal fluids a strain of _A. xylosoxidans_
subsp. _xylosoxidans_ with the same biochemical and antimicrobial
sensitivity patterns was identified. The culture of samples of the
dialysates from the original packages gave negative results; however, the
culture of various lots of the antiseptic used by the patients were all
positive for the same bacterial strain.

By the time of their initial consultation all patients experienced severe
diffuse abdominal pain and noticed an extremely cloudy dialysate effluent.
Dialysate white cells counts were high, with an average of 4269 cells per
cubic millimeter, 93 per cent polymorphonuclear neutrophils. All patients
underwent peritoneal washing and were placed on an empirical antimicrobial
combination with cephalothin 20 mg/kg QD and ceftazidime 20 mg/kg QD in the
same dialysis bag, according to the recommendations by the International
Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD). No apparent clinical or
bacteriological improvement was seen after 72 hours.

Once the microorganism was identified, 250 mg of intraperitoneal imipenem
was given 12 hourly for 14 days. The clinical and bacteriological evolution
of the patients was satisfactory. Since the same bacterial strain isolated
was grown from the commercial antiseptic product used by the patients and
the dialysate samples, a different antiseptic compound was provided.

Four of the patients have remained in same schedule of CAPD to date.
Patients did not require shifting to hemodialysis or replacement of the
peritoneal catheters. 1 patient received a successful cadaveric renal
transplant 4 months after the episode of peritonitis.

Of note, the same commercial product was associated about 4 years ago with
an extensive outbreak of nosocomial sepsis in various clinical centers of
the country, by a strain of _A. xylosoxidans_ subsp. _xylosoxidans_ with
similar biochemical and of antimicrobial sensitivity patterns as the strain
involved in the current report. The probable identity of the isolates
obtained from the clinical samples, as well as those from the lots of the
antiseptic product involved in both outbreaks, will be investigated by
means of genotyping techniques.

[This is another example of the contamination of an antiseptic solution by
microorganisms. One of the classical examples was the contamination and
transmission of pseudomonads by benzalkonium compounds, as exemplified by
the paper (Oie S, Kamiya A. Microbial contamination of antiseptics and
disinfectants. Am J Infect Control 1996; 24: 389-95) whose abstract is
reproduced below:

BACKGROUND: There have been a number of reports on microbial contamination
of antiseptics and disinfectants. At present, however, the necessity of
measures to prevent contamination do not seem to be fully appreciated. We
investigated microbial contamination of antiseptics and disinfectants that
are used in our hospital.

METHODS: 51 samples of benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate
that were being used in the hospital were examined. Viability of the
contaminants detected in these samples was also tested in the agents. Then
we examined measures to prevent contamination of these agents.

RESULTS: Microbial contamination was detected at 10(2) to 10(7) CFU/ml in
the following samples: 6 of 23 samples of cotton balls soaked in 0.02 per
cent benzalkonium chloride kept in a canister for antisepsis and
disinfection (26.1 per cent); 7 of 13 samples of 0.02 per cent,
benzalkonium chloride or 0.02 per cent chlorhexidine gluconate in an
irrigation apparatus kept at 37 degrees C for vaginal douching (53.8 per
cent); and 9 of 15 samples of 0.02 per cent benzalkonium chloride or 0.05
per cent chlorhexidine gluconate for storage of suction catheters in a
plastic bottle (60 per cent). The major contaminants were _Burkholderia
cepacia_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, _Xanthomonas maltophilia_, and
_Pseudomonas fluorescens_. The first 2 organisms examined grew in the
agents. After improvements in the handling of the antiseptics and
disinfectants, no microbial contamination was observed.

CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to check microbial contamination of diluted
benzalkonium chloride and diluted chlorhexidine gluconate that are in use.
Such products are not recommended as antiseptics. - Mod.LL]
