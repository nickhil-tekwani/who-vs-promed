A Santa Fe County man is the 2nd person to contract the plague in New
Mexico in 2006, the state Department of Health said.
The unidentified man was hospitalized Wed, 30 May 2006, in critical
but stable condition, said Deborah Busemeyer, department spokeswoman.
The man was suffering from the septicemic form of the disease in
which the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream.
The department confirmed last Fri, 26 May 2006, that a Bernalillo
County woman died the previous week of the septicemic form of the
plague. She was the 1st person to die from plague in New Mexico in a
dozen years.
Plague generally is transmitted to people by the bites of infected
fleas, but also can be transmitted by direct contact with infected
animals -- rodents, wildlife and pets.
"This is the time of year when we see the most plague activity, so
it's especially important to avoid rodents and fleas by getting wood
and compost piles away from your home and making sure your pet has an
effective flea control product," said C. Mack Sewell, state
epidemiologist for the department.

[As discussed in an earlier ProMED post -- Plague, animals - USA
(CO): early season cases 20060220.0563 -- a mild winter seems to have
contributed to an increase in cases of feral animal and human plague
in 2006.
A map of New Mexico showing the counties can be found at:
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/newmexico_90.jpg>. It
should be noted that Santa Fe county borders on Bernalillo county.
Both are in the central part of the state.
The following children's' rhyme (of unclear origin) has elements that
can be interpreted as being related to plague, epidemic in the Middle
Ages.
Ring around the rosies,
A pocket full of posies,
Ashes, ashes!
We all fall down
Rosies represent rosary beads, used to (hopefully) provide divine
intervention against the disease. Plague victims may emit a rather
strong and objectionable odor; flowers (posies) could be carried to
mask the smell. Ashes are all that was left of a burnt corpse (in
the Middle Ages).
"All fall down" reflects the profound death rate. Around 1348, the
population of England was estimated to be about 4 million, and within
2.5 years about 1/3 had died from plague, sometimes called The Great
Dying. One third of the residents of Florence died in the first 6
months of the epidemic and as much as 75 percent died in a single
year. Venice lost 60 percent of its population over 18 months that
the epidemic raged.
Alternatively, for the last 2 lines of the rhyme:
The 3rd line can be replaced with "A Tishoo, a tishoo," which
represents the sneezes of the victims of pneumonic plague which are
infectious to others.
To be sneezed on by them was a sure death sentence for all. The
death rate for those who acquire pneumonic plague directly is almost
100 percent. - Mod.LL]
