New South Wales [NSW] now has just 200 infected properties where the
disease is still likely to be active. A recent report on the epidemic
shows the state is on track to eradicate the disease.

NSW DPI [Department of Primary Industries] epidemiologists are
monitoring the equine influenza outbreak closely, using information
collected to report the situation and make predictions.

The areas that the state has moved to green zones in recent weeks
means that the status of 1479 previously infected properties have
been resolved.

While the great majority of properties remain to be cleared -- there
are more than 5000 -- the infections are all more than 21 days old
and are no longer likely to be contagious.

Recent cases -- those under 21 days old (shown in the graph in red)
-- are still considered active.

"As can be seen," the state epidemiologists said in a report, "the
number of recent cases reached a peak in late September 2007, started
to decline from about the 2nd week of October 2007 and is now about
200 [recently infected properties] state-wide. Numbers of older cases
have increased progressively since late September 2007. Increasing
numbers of cases have now been resolved, with work progressing to
actively resolve cases, particularly in outlying areas and clusters."

The total number of infected properties is starting to level off at
around 5500 to 6000 as the number of recently reported infected
properties declines.

The figures show that the numbers of new cases increased rapidly in
the 1st few weeks, reaching a peak of about 1000 new infected
properties in the 4th week (late September 2007).

Numbers of new infected properties have declined substantially since
about week 7 to about 50 a week since early November 2007 (week 11).

Just 51 newly infected premises have been identified in the last
week, compared to 55 the week before. All new cases have been in
existing infected areas, including cases at Grenfell, Narrabri,
Armidale/Walcha, Parkes/Forbes and in parts of the purple zone. No
new outlying cases have been identified in the last week.

The estimated dissemination rate (EDR) for a disease is the average
number of new cases generated by each existing case. An EDR of
greater than one indicates that the disease will continue to spread
and the epidemic will continue. Conversely, an EDR of less than one
means that the epidemic will gradually die out.

The EDR for horse flu has progressively declined since mid-September
2007 and has been below one for most of the time since early October 2007.

This, the epidemiologists say, provides "strong encouragement" that
the disease is under control and eradication is achievable.

[Since the previous report, the number of recently infected
properties has climbed slightly. But it encouraging to hear that
there is believed to be some light at the end of the proverbial
disease tunnel. Hopefully, they will successfully eradicate the
disease. - Mod.TG]
