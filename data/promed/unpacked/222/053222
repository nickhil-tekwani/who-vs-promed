Our experience in using the Biken vaccine in Thailand is very similar to
Dr. Henry Wilde and the team at the Red Cross Hospital in Bangkok.
In the last 2 plus years we have provided 1,583 doses of the Biken product
and have had no (zero) serious adverse effects.
About 10 percent of those injection events resulted in complaints of minor
injection site pain and about 8 percent caused some mild redness and
itching effect.
Like Dr. Wilde I am most concerned practitioners may decide not to use a
very reliable and worthwhile vaccine against a serious disease.

[We have gone over this many times. As Drs. Wilde and Morley have stated,
the vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective. If it is not being
employed where it should be, that is a question of judgement (poor), will
(insufficient), money (insufficient), knowledge (insufficient) or all four.
JE, yellow fever, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, and other diseases are
preventable. If they are not prevented that is another story altogether.
