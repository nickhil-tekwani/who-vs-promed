Horses found to have encephalitis
-----------------------------------
The Polk County Health Department confirmed 5 cases of encephalitis in
horses on Thursday. The horses infected with eastern equine encephalitis
were located in northern and south eastern Polk.
The mosquitoborne disease causes inflammation of the brain, which can lead
to headaches and fever and, in extreme cases, brain damage, stroke,
seizures, or death.

[This should be read in the context of Florida reporting 51 equine cases in
2005 up to 15 June. With the rain we are having across the south, we can
expect plenty of these reports this summer out of Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. - Mod.MHJ]
