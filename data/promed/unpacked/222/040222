In a report, the city of Sinnamary indicated that there is a suspicious chikungunya [fever] case in the community. In order to avoid the spread of the disease, the city is requesting that all inhabitants take all the necessary measures to destroy breeding sites in and around homes, to protect themselves from mosquito bites by using repellents and isolating themselves with bed nets as an option.

In case of fever and joint pain in the extremities, it is indicated that inhabitants quickly consult with their physician.

[Sinnamarie city is on the coast of French Guiana, between Kourou, where there has been local transmission of chikungunya virus, and Suriname. If this is a locally acquired case, it is an indication that the virus is spreading in the country.

Communicable Disease Threats Report (CDTR), week 10 (2-8 Mar 2014)
------------------------------------------------------------------
On 6 Dec 2013, France reported 2 laboratory-confirmed autochthonous cases of chikungunya in the French part of the Caribbean island of St Martin. Since then, local transmission has been confirmed in the Dutch part of Saint Martin [St Maarten], on Martinique, St Barthelemy, Guadeloupe, British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Anguilla, and French Guiana. Aruba only reported imported cases. This is the 1st documented outbreak of chikungunya with autochthonous transmission in the Americas. As of 6 Mar 2014, there have been close to 8000 suspected cases in the region. There have been 3 fatalities reported.

Update of the week
------------------
During the past week the number of new cases reported increased in some of the affected areas. No new affected areas or islands were reported. The islands affected are St Martin/St Maarten, Martinique, St Barthelemy, Guadeloupe, Virgin Islands (UK), Anguilla, Dominica, Aruba, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and French Guiana in mainland South America.

[It is good to learn that there are no new localities reporting chikungunya virus infections, either locally acquired or imported. However, with new cases being reported in localities with previously reported cases, the risk of spread to other islands or mainland countries remains real. There is no further information concerning the suspected cases in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico reported in last week's update (see ProMED-mail archive no 20140302.2309812). It is important to know if these cases were confirmed or discarded.

[3] Anguilla

The Ministry of Health is advising that 3 new cases of chikungunya [virus infection] have been diagnosed in Anguilla bringing the overall number of laboratory confirmed cases to 14 to date.

The Ministry is once again appealing to anyone experiencing any signs and symptoms of chikungunya fever to see a doctor. Chikungunya fever is a viral disease transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. It is not transmitted via direct human to human contact. Chikungunya fever is basically characterized by sudden onset of high fever, severe pain in joints especially the wrists and ankles, and muscular pain or tenderness which may persist for several months. Parents and guardians of students exhibiting any of these symptoms are advised not to send their children to school or any other environment for a period of at least 2 weeks following the onset of symptoms in order to avoid the potential spread of the chikungunya virus.

The Ministry of Health and Social Development continues to work vigorously with the relevant agencies to ensure the appropriate preventative measures are implemented to reduce and contain the spread of the virus. The Department of Health Protection will continue island wide fogging and is seeking full cooperation from the public.

The Ministry of Health and Social Development continues to inform persons of the importance of taking the necessary preventative measures to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. Individuals should use insect repellent sprays/creams, wear long sleeve shirts and pants or protective clothing when outdoors, use mosquito nets, and stay in areas with screens to avoid being bitten by infected mosquitoes. In addition, individuals, householders, businesses, and ports should strive to eliminate mosquito breeding sites from in and around their premises to reduce the proliferation of adult mosquitoes on their premises. They should make every effort to remove stagnant water, cover water storage containers, and ensure cisterns are screened to eliminate mosquito breeding and harbourage. These simple measures will go a long way in preventing mosquito bites and mosquito borne disease transmission.

[The 3 new cases indicate that local transmission of the virus has been continuing in Anguilla. It will be interesting to learn if the public information and education efforts will bring transmission to a halt.

Anguilla island is a British overseas territory in the Caribbean and one of the most northerly of the Leeward Islands in the Lesser Antilles.
