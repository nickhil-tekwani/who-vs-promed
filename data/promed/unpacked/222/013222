A 26-year-old man became the latest victim of _Naegleria fowleri_, the "brain-eating amoeba," in Karachi, Geo News reported Thursday [28 Jun 2018].

The man, who lived in Shadman Society area of Malir, passed away in a private hospital. _Naegleria fowleri_, which is found in freshwater, has claimed 4 lives in Karachi this year [2018], it was reported.

Doctors and health experts say naegleria usually enters the brain and attacks the nervous system when infected water is ingested through the nasal cavity while bathing, swimming or performing ablution.

The deadly amoeba survives on bacteria in warm waters and can only be eliminated through proper chlorination or boiling of water.

[The continuous reports of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) cases, mainly from Sindh province, are a cause for concern, and since the possible route and consequences of the illness are quite well known, focus on concise communication for the public would be quite helpful. - Mod.UBA
