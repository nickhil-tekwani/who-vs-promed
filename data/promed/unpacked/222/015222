West Nile Virus Transmission In The Middle East
-----------------------------------------------
In the Middle East, it has been suggested that migratory birds [may be
responsible for dissemination of the virus within this region across
Israel, Jordan and possibly Saudi Arabia. {Unfortunately there is little
or no surveillance and/or health education as regards West Nile virus [over
most of this region, despite the real and perceived threats of the virus
in these past few months. In late summer, at the beginning of the school
year (early September), there were newspaper reports of the hunting of
migratory birds in some regions of Saudi Arabia. These birds were said to
have been hunted for eating purposes. This coincided with the time in
neighboring Israel when there was a rise in [West Nile virus-related
disease. [A question that needs to be addressed is whether it may be
possible for West Nile virus to be transmitted directly (perhaps through
virus shed in faecal droppings,etc) to other susceptible animals [in this
region, such as wild equids?

Some Answers to Previous Comments and Questions
------------------------------------------------
The demonstration of bird-to-bird transmission of West Nile virus (WNV) in
crows by Bob McLean and his group at the National Wildlife Health Center is
a significant, but not completely unexpected, finding. The possibility of
transmission of WNV unrelated to mosquitoes was the topic of significant
discussion at the West Nile virus Workshop in Tarrytown, NY last January.
In our study of West Nile virus in zoo birds and native crows in New York
City in 1999 (Vet Pathol 37:3, 2000), my colleagues and I demonstrated
virus in a wide variety of tissues and cell types, showing that the virus
was clearly pantropic in birds. Importantly, regarding the current
discussion, we showed using immunostaining, virus isolation and PCR that
virus was present in the intestines of 93% of cases and in the kidneys of
100% of cases tested. In addition, we noted virus in the bursa and in
feathers, however the numbers of these tissues analyzed was too few to make
valid conclusions from and include in our report.
The topic of transmission via infectious fecal material has been the
subject of previous ProMED discussions. I would only add that the
possibility of direct cloacal contact between crows and other birds should
also be considered as a possible mode of transmission. Hopefully, further
studies at the National Wildlife Health Center and elsewhere will clarify
the matter.
In a variety of newspaper articles and other information releases that I
have seen, a number of public health officials have asserted that the
handling of potentially infected birds was not considered hazardous, since
only mosquitoes could transmit the virus. The study by Dr. McLean, along
with previous reports that West Nile virus is a well-documented lab hazard,
should make it clear that a more conservative [precautionary approach to
the handling of birds is justified. The lack of evidence to date that bird
to human transmission has occurred does not preclude such an event in the
future, as the virus continues to spread in the U.S. The finding in our
study that tissues other than brain were more commonly infected than the
brain itself is also worth emphasis. It is my understanding that many of
the laboratories testing dead birds for WNV are doing so by removing the
brain for analysis. In our study, heart, kidney and intestines were more
frequently positive. In particular, crows and magpies appeared to have very
limited virus in the brain. Because these tissues can be more rapidly and
safely obtained than the brain, testing of heart, kidney or intestines
should provide a safer and quicker means of testing, with potentially fewer
false negative results.
That the strain of West Nile virus seen in the U.S. and in Israel since
1998 is unusually virulent and pantropic in birds is another matter that
should be the subject of future studies. Comparative testing of the U.S.
strain against strains responsible for previous outbreaks of West Nile
fever outside the U.S. is needed. The threat to certain species of birds by
the U.S. strain of West Nile virus is clearly one of the dramatic
consequences of its introduction here. While the effect on crows is
obvious, already threatened species like the bald eagle are also at risk.
We reported one fatal case in our study, and at least one additional bald
eagle was reported on ProMED-nail [so far unconfirmed - Mod.CP earlier
this year.

Statement from Dr. McLean of the USGS National Wildlife Health Center
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Regarding crow to crow transmission of WNV in an experimental setting:
Crows in the experimental study were housed in a certified biosafety level
3 facility. The animal isolation wing is a shower out containment area, the
supply air is single pass, rooms are under negative pressure and each room
is exhausted separately through a Hepa filter. The rooms housing the crows
were in the interior of the facility and were thoroughly disinfected with
paraformaldehyde prior to use for this study as all rooms are for
experimental studies. The floor of the experimental room was scrubbed every
day during the study.
All crows in the study were examined for the presence of ectoparasites upon
arrival and multiple times through the housing period with no parasites
observed. The birds also received 2 doses of a parasiticide during their
acclimation period. Crow carcasses were examined during the postmortem
diagnostic work-up for any evidence of ectoparasites. In addition, the
transmission and incubation periods were too short for the virus to have
been transmitted by ectoparasites.

[Many of the questions posed in the previous posts have been answered by
these 2 informative communications. Dr. Steele's observations on the choice
of organs for sampling are particularly relevant for future surveillance
programs. Dr. McLean, whose experiments initiated this discussion, has the
last word. This thread is now cut. - Mod.CP
