Wildlife officials in Montana are closely watching a herd of bighorn sheep near the northern boundary of Yellowstone Park after several of the animals were killed by an outbreak of pneumonia.

Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks [FWP] staffers have collected 10 dead bighorn sheep in recent weeks, a mix of rams, lambs and one adult ewe. Analysis at the state wildlife lab in Bozeman determined they all died from pneumonia.

The sheep were part of a herd in the Gardiner area, just north of Yellowstone. But it's impossible to detect the exact source of the outbreak, according to FWP.

Wild bighorn sheep are highly susceptible to respiratory illnesses transmitted by healthy domestic sheep which are resistant to the diseases, and, currently, there are domestic sheep flocks in the area, according to state wildlife officials.

Bighorn sheep herds are impacted differently by pneumonia, FWP wildlife veterinarian Jennifer Ramsey said. "Sometimes we'll see a large-scale, all-age die-off in which most of the population dies, and that population never really rebounds," Ramsey said. "Yet, in other herds, we see a low level mortality year after year."

In the Gardiner area, bighorn sheep have experienced a small number of pneumonia cases in each of the last few years, but not to the current extent.

Kevin Hurley, conservation director for the Wild Sheep Foundation in Cody, says contact between wild and domestic sheep has been proven by many studies to pose a high risk for disease transmission.

"This is the biggest challenge we have in bighorn restoration in the West. It's a big deal," said Hurley, who worked previously for the Game and Fish Department as a biologist specializing in wild sheep management.

Pneumonia can easily spread through a wild herd, Hurley said. Game agencies often will capture or kill bighorn sheep known to have been in contact with domestic sheep or goats in an effort to prevent the likely spread of disease. Montana has seen about 20 percent of its bighorn herds statewide die in the last several years, mainly from pandemic [sic: more correctly panzootic. - Mod.JW] respiratory disease.

Die-offs also in Nebraska and North Dakota
-----------------------------------------------
Large-scale die-offs also are underway in Nebraska and North Dakota, Hurley said. A similar outbreak could potentially happen anywhere there is contact between wild and domestic sheep, including around Cody, home to one of the largest bighorn herds in the country, Hurley adds. Game agencies can't force private landowners to relocate domestic sheep, and there's no foolproof method for guaranteeing separation on public grazing lands, especially when young rams wander off during the seasonal rut. "But we do always try to maintain separation in time and space between wild and domestic sheep," Hurley says.

Yellowstone Park is home to about a dozen interbreeding bands of bighorn sheep, which roam the steep terrain of the upper Yellowstone River drainage, according to the park's "Resources and Issues Handbook." Centered around Mount Everts, the bighorn sheep population in Yellowstone fluctuates from about 100-400 animals, with the most recent count in 2012 showing 378 sheep.

[Bighorn sheep pneumonia has traditionally been considered a multifactorial disease, caused by multiple pathogens. Due to their complexity, multifactorial phenomena like this usually require integrated and sustained research efforts to be unveiled. The absence of established and universal explanations for pneumonia outbreaks contributes to conflict among wildlife and livestock stakeholders over land use and management practices.

The bighorn sheep pneumonia web-of-causation may have an important environmental component. Recent die-offs of bighorn sheep in several locations suggest that the proximate cause of these events may be a shared environmental determinant. If so, culling ill animals may be useless.

However, recent evidence indicates that in the northwestern USA, there seems to be a single pathogen implicated in bighorn sheep outbreaks, _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_, an exotic disease agent for North America introduced by domestic ovids. In this case, culling an infected herd might be an effective way to prevent the disease being transmitted to a "healthy" population. Nonetheless, if all bighorn sheep will eventually be exposed to _M. pneumoniae_, culling would actually prevent the natural selection of a resistant population or the establishment of herd immunity. - Mod.PMB
