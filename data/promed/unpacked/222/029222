_Xylella fastidiosa_ (EPPO A1 quarantine pest) is present in
Brazil where it causes plum leaf scald and citrus variegated
chlorosis, and more recently it has been found on coffee (see
EPPO RS 96/169). So far, Pierce disease of grapevine has not
been observed in Brazil. =20
In South America, _X. fastidiosa_ is
present in Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay (new record according
to the EPPO Secretariat - Leite Jr, 1996). Plum leaf scald was
observed at the beginning of the 1970s in the southern States of
Brazil (Minas Gerais, Parana, Rio Grande do Sul, Sao Paulo, Santa
Catarina). Citrus variegated chlorosis was observed in 1987 in=20
north-east Sao Paulo State and in the region of the Mineiro=20
triangle (Minas Gerais State) (Carvalho, M.L.V, 1996). The
disease then spread to practically all citrus-growing areas in
the country (Goias, Rio de Janeiro, Parana, Sergipe) and was
observed very recently in Santa Catarina State (Leite, Jr et al.,
1996).
Studies on the transmission of _X. fastidiosa_ by leafhoppers in
citrus orchards have been carried out. The bacterium is
transmitted in a persistent, non-circulative way by Cicadellidae
and Cercopidae. In citrus orchards, it was observed that several
insects i.e. _Dilobopterus costalimai_, _Acrogonia terminalis_
and _Oncometopia_ sp. are able to transmit the disease (Lopes, et
al., 1996).
The bacterium has been observed on coffee near Campinas (Sao
Paulo, Minas Gerais). Preliminary studies (Ueno & Leite Jr,
1996), have shown that the isolates from coffee and citrus seem
to be slightly different.
