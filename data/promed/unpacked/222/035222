FELINE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY, CAT - SWITZERLAND: CORRECTION
**************************
A ProMED-mail post

The post 20030824.2132 suffered from some errors and omissions, which are
corrected below.
The URL for the DEFRA website is
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/bse/index.html> as was posted, but to get
to the quoted section you have to click first on Statistics in the left
margin, then on other TSEs in paragraph 2.
Paragraph 1 of the Statistics page states:
The detailed BSE statistics in this section are generally for Great
Britain. That is why the Northern Ireland case was shown separately in
their list. It was incorrect for us to say the figure of 89 was for the
UK, and that Northern Ireland was outside the UK, because the United
Kingdom consists of Great Britain & Northern Ireland.
The ProMED post stated:
A presumptive FSE case in an imported Asian Golden Cat in an Australian zoo
was reported in August 2002. The correct name for the animal is the
Asiatic Golden Cat (_Catopuma temmincki_).
ProMED regrets the errors. - Mods.ARN/JW
