Mysterious virus threatening Kinneret's St. Peter's fish
--------------------------------------------------------
An unknown virus is threatening the population of St. Peter's fish (Tilapia) in the Lake Kinneret's (Sea of Galilee). The virus, which has yet to be identified, is causing the fish to go blind, therefore inhibiting their ability to search for food and causing them to starve to death.

According to an expert report, the mysterious disease has been plaguing the Kinneret's Tilapia for a decade, but some unknown factor has recently caused it to become an epidemic.

Fishery and veterinarian experts are unsure of the cause, but say that the disease has not stopped the fishing or marketing of the St. Peter's fish. Some concerns have also been raised as to the fact that the virus' effect on the lake's eco-system is still unknown.

St. Peter's Fish, which derives its name for the New Testament story of the feeding of the multitude (Matthew 14:13-21, Mark 6:31-44, Luke 9:10-17 and John 6:5-15) is considered sacred by Christians. Restaurants on the shores of the Sea of Galilee are said to be serving over 300 000 fish dinners to pilgrims every year.

The virus, it seems, has recently begun to spread, and is now affecting some fish ponds in the Hula Valley, where the Jordan River Tilapia, silver carp, carp, and mullet are farmed [see comment].

According to a recent report, 12-15 percent of the fish in the lake have already contracted the disease.

Since the virus has yet to be identified, is it also unknown what effect -- if any -- it has on humans. All that is known at this point is that it is a viral nervous necrosis type virus.

The Agriculture Ministry has tasked a team of experts to research the disease, and they are -- in concert with other countries -- currently conducting tests and experiments meant to fully identify the lethal virus and develop both a cure and a vaccine.

[From a reliable source we are informed that the causative pathogen is an RNA virus, yet to be identified, which has been cultivated and propagated in a novel Tilapia cell line. Molecular diagnostic tools are currently being developed. Only Tilapines (Tilapia and Tristamella spp) are known to be susceptible to this, still anonymous, pathogen.

Viral diseases in fish are difficult or rather impossible to "cure." Hopefully, the efforts invested by local parties and their international partners will lead to an early elucidation of the disease's etiology and subsequently pave the way to the future development of a potent vaccine.

Results of the research, when available, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
