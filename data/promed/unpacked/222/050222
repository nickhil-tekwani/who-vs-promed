Aksu Prefecture Launches Fever Clinics to Guard Against the Spread of Measles
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since January [2008], the number of respiratory infectious disease
patients in the counties and municipality of the Aksu Prefecture has
increased over the same period last year [2007]. Of these, the number
of measles patients is greatest. At present, most measles cases are
in children under 4 years of age, who account for 80 percent of
patients. The 8 counties and one municipality of Aksu Prefecture are involved.
