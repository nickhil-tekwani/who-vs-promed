At least 420 people in Sidomulyo, South Lampung regency, have been
infected with the mosquito-borne chikungunya [virus] since early in
the month [January 2010], prompting local health authorities to
declare the outbreak an emergency. A top official at the local health
agency, Kristi Endrawati, told Antara news agency in Kalianda on
Tuesday [16 Feb 2010] that the disease had spread from one village to
another within a relatively short time. She said the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito, which carries the chikungunya virus and spreads it to humans
through its bite, was rapidly reproducing in cacao plantation areas in
the regency. "The cacao pod can hold water and become a mosquito nest
which contributes to the spread of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. It is
impossible to fog all the plantations since they are too big and it is
not effective. We only fog residential areas," she said.

Once infected with chikungunya [virus], victims develop a high fever,
reddish spots, joint pain, vomiting, flu symptoms, and headaches.

Officials from the agency have campaigned to ask local people to cover
all water catchments and clean all ponds periodically to reduce the
number of mosquitoes in the area especially during the rainy season.

Earlier this year [2010], over 12 000 people in Lampung were recorded
to have contracted the disease, the highest recorded number in the
last 10 years. [This outbreak with over 12 000 cases began in
mid-December 2009, so not all of these cases occurred in 2010 (see
ProMED-mail archive no. 20100101.0015). - Mod.TY]
