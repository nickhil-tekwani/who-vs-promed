[1] Bubonic plague investigation - RFI
--------------------------------------
On 22 Feb 2020, the Aungba Health Zone chief medical doctor was alerted that suspect bubonic plague cases were reported in the Ugunzu-Makangi village of the Aterlembe health area, Djugu territory, Ituri Province, DR Congo. Murine epizootics were also mentioned in the Makangi village. On 23 Feb 2020, the chief medical doctor of the Aungba health Zone (Lat 2 33' 00'' Long 30 30' 00'') was appointed to visit the health center of Aterlembe for 2 days to investigate suspect bubonic plague cases. The head doctor Dr Delphonse Unen Ali reported on the same day (23 Feb 2020) on the outbreak. The nurse of the Aterlembe health center notified 2 suspected cases of bubonic plague. He reported that the index cases were 2 family members who presented with fever, headache, and painful buboes on 22 Feb 2020 at 2 health centers. After self-medicating for 6 days (16-22 Feb 2020), they consulted as ambulatory patients the Kpese health post and then the Yuku health center, both in the Aru health zone. A 2-year-old boy died on 21 Feb 2020 with symptoms consistent with that of bubonic plague (fever, painful buboes), the 2nd patient -- the 12 year old brother of the co-primary case -- tested positive for plague with the RDT [rapid diagnostic test] and is recovering. He presented with fever, painful buboes, and headaches. So far 16 contacts have been traced and treated with doxycycline, 27 households were dusted.

[2] Pneumonic plague - follow up to: PRO/AH/EDR> Plague - Congo DR: (IT) pneumonic, fatal, susp, RFI 20200225.7026580
--------------------
Between 19 Feb 2020 and 25 Feb 2020, the health area of Godjoka has experienced an outbreak of suspected pneumonic plague. Symptoms reported were headache, painful cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and diarrhea lasting 3 days followed by death. On 25 Feb 2020, the traditional healer's body, positive for plague with the rapid diagnostic test, was transported by relatives to a small locality near Kpandruma (Lat. 2° 03' 15.3" Long. 30° 50' 58.2", alt 2804m) in the Rethy Health Zone, Djugu territory, Ituri Province DR Congo. She was buried there. The transport by relatives increases the risk of plague spread to relatives and mourning villagers. It should be noted that the city of Kpandruma is the major commercial center of the region . On 25 Feb 2020, the intervention team treated over 300 contacts with doxycycline, and disinfected the houses where the bodies were laid prior to burial. Children under 10 years old and pregnant women have received cotrimoxazole [trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole] on the morning of 26 Feb 2020.

[ProMED thanks our colleagues in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and at the EcoHealth Alliance for this report.

The bacterium that causes plague is _Yersinia pestis_. Most cases of plague are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten. At this point in the illness, there is no risk of person-to-person spread, so if this was indeed a case of bubonic plague, no isolation or quarantine is necessary.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may produce bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to have happened in this case, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia.

Patients with primary pneumonic plague generate large quantities of infectious aerosols that pose a significant risk to close contacts.

CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines identify contacts within 2 meters (6.5 ft) as being at greatest risk and do not consider the organism likely to be carried through air ducts or vents. Persons who have been in contact with pneumonic plague patients or handling potentially infectious body fluids or tissues without appropriate protection should receive preventive antimicrobial therapy. The preferred antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis include tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones. - Mod.LL
