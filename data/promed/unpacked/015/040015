In a follow-up on the crisis in Yemen, the country's Ministry of Public Health and Population is reporting that the number of suspected cholera cases have more than quadrupled in the past 2 weeks. According to health officials, a total of 2733 suspected cases and 51 associated deaths have been reported in Ta'iz, Aden, Lahij, Al Hudaydah, Hajjah, Sana'a, Al Bayda, Dhamar, and Ibb. 75 cholera cases have been laboratory-confirmed so far.

While acute watery diarrheal diseases are endemic in Yemen, the ongoing conflict has stretched the capacity of the national health systems. More than 7.6 million people are currently living in areas affected by the outbreak, as well as more than 3 million internally displaced persons.

WHO is working in coordination with Ministry of Public Health and Population, UNICEF, and partner nongovernmental organizations on the ground to run a joint Health and WASH taskforce to provide an integrated response.

This includes support for eDEWs [Electronic Diseases Early Warning System]/surveillance, laboratory support, establishment of 21 cholera treatment centres in affected governorates, training on early detection and management of cases, provision of essential supplies such as IV fluids, diarrheal disease kits, oral rehydration solutions, and water chlorination kits.

WHO is also supporting social mobilization and health education among citizens to raise their awareness of cholera and diarrheal diseases.

[Poverty, flooding, drought, and war are the 4 horsemen of cholera. The conditions in the impoverished Arabian peninsula country of Yemen are ideal for the rapid spread of _Vibrio cholerae_. These 2 posts differ widely in both the total number of presumed cases and the number of deaths. Accurate statistics are clearly difficult to assess in Yemen at this point but is likely to rise dramatically in this country of more than 24 million inhabitants. Spread northward across the border to Saudi Arabia is likely as well as eastward to Oman.

Yemen is divided into 21 governorates (muhafazah), and they can be seen on a map at https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorates_of_Yemen.

The mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness. As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), 2014, Nova Science Publishers, 2015, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
