Zimbabwean Department of Veterinary Services Director Stuart Hargreaves
said on Tuesday there is a new isolated outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD) at Manondo Farm near Nyamandlovu in Matebeleland North Province.
Hargreaves said the disease outbreak was detected last week, adding that 12
cattle out of about 1000 at the farm have been infected by the virus,
forcing the department to vaccinate all the livestock. "We are trying to
establish the source of the disease, but indications are it might have been
caused by illegal movement of livestock from communal to commercial farming
areas," said the director.
The latest FMD outbreak followed similar outbreaks of the disease in some
parts of Matebeleland North province and a feed lot in Masvingo Province in
August this year. The outbreaks led to the suspension of Zimbabwean beef
exports to the European Union.
Zimbabwe has an annual export quota of 9100 tons of beef worth 2 billion
Zimbabwean dollars (about 36.4 million U.S. dollars).
Referring to an anthrax outbreak in Zhombe District in the Midlannds
province, Hargreaves said the department has so far vaccinated 40 000 out
of the 170 000 cattle in an effort to contain the disease.
