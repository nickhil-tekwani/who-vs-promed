6 people were infected with campylobacteriosis from raw milk ingestion from the Family Cow dairy store in Chambersburg, PA, including 3 in Maryland, the state Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said Friday, 27 Jan 2011.

The state agency and the health department in Pennsylvania are advising consumers to discard any product bought from this farm since 1 Jan 2012. The implicated milk comes in plastic gallon, half gallon and pint containers and is sold directly to consumers on the farm and at drop off points and retail stores in Pennsylvania. It's illegal to sell unpasteurized milk in Maryland, though some consumers have reported getting it anyway at pre-determined drop off points.

Raw milk has become popular with some people who believe it has superior nutrition because it's not heated to kill germs like pasteurized milk. Studies, however, have not confirmed this, and federal and state authorities continue to warn about the dangers of unpasteurized milk, ice cream, yogurt and some cheeses.

"We're disappointed that this is being made to look definite when, one, the testing hasn't been completed, and two, the test they did do came from an open jug of milk in one family's refrigerator," said Edwin Shank, who is a fourth generation owner of the Family Cow farm.

He said the bacteria is easily spreadable can could have been introduced into the jug once it was opened by a family member who was already infected. He said he's never heard of a customer becoming sick from his milk, and no one on the farm has been sickened. And he said through 5 generations his family has been drinking raw milk from their cows "for 100 years."

Shank said that he has a good relationship with the health department and wants customers to know that he disinfects his pipes after every milking and sends samples of milk for testing 6 times as often as is legally required. He's been selling organic milk for 6 years and added raw milk 3 years ago because of strong demand.

[It is a violation of federal law enforced by the FDA to sell raw milk packaged for consumer use across state lines (interstate commerce). But each state regulates the sale of raw milk within the state (intrastate), and some states, such as Pennsylvania, allow it to be sold. This means that in some states, dairy operations may sell it to local retail food stores or to consumers directly from the farm or at agricultural fairs or other community events, depending on the state law.

In states that prohibit intrastate sales of raw milk, some people have tried to circumvent the law by "cow sharing," or "cow leasing." They pay a fee to a farmer to lease or purchase part of a cow in exchange for raw milk, claiming that they are not actually buying the milk since they are part owners of the cow. Wisconsin banned cow-leasing programs after 75 people became infected with _Campylobacter jejuni_ bacteria in 2001 from drinking unpasteurized milk obtained through such a program.

Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with raw milk ingestion.

Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ species, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with raw milk ingestion. - Mod.
