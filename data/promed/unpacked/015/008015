Polio virus surfaces in UP after 10 months
------------------------------------------
The most common form of the [poliovirus] that health officials
believed was on the verge of eradication from India has resurfaced in
Uttar Pradesh (UP), defying a new vaccination strategy introduced 3 years ago.

The National Polio Surveillance programme has detected 32 cases of
polio caused by the P1 poliovirus [wild poliovirus type 1, (WPV1)] in
7 districts of Uttar Pradesh from June through September this year
[2008], after 10 months of no P1 [WPV1] anywhere in the state.

The P1 virus (WPV1) -- one of 3 serotypes of the wild poliovirus --
has returned despite intensive immunisation of children in Bihar and
Uttar Pradesh with a new monovalent oral polio vaccine (mOPV) over
the past 2 years. India's health ministry had introduced mOPV about 3
years ago after studies had shown that it is a sharper and more
effective tool against the poliovirus than the trivalent OPV.

"We've seen some great progress in recent months, but the appearance
of P1 [WPV1] in UP is disappointing," said T Jacob John, head of the
India Expert Advisory Group [IEAG], a panel that advises the
government on how to conduct its war on polio.

The actual size of the resurgence -- the total number of children
infected -- would be higher than 32, he said. "Each case of polio
indicates about 160 other susceptible, or unprotected, children
infected," John said.

Polio programme officials said the mOPV has performed very well and,
as expected, better than the trivalent OPV. They said genetic studies
on the virus circulating in Uttar Pradesh have shown that P1 [WPV1]
slipped into the state's Badaun district from Bihar.

"It is because of mOPV that the most endemic part of India -- western
UP -- had been able to stop P1 [WPV1] transmission for more than 18
months," said Hamid Jafari, project manager of the National Polio
Surveillance Project [NPSP], a joint programme of the Indian
government and the World Health Organisation (WHO).

"The P1 [WPV1] cases in Badaun reflect reduced frequency and
increased interval between mOPV immunisation rounds in 2007 to tackle
an outbreak of (polio caused by) P3," Jafari said.

"This allowed an increase in (the number of) susceptible children in
the young age group who had not received sufficient doses of mOPV."

In a meeting in May this year [2008], the IEAG had said that
following intensive vaccination activities by the government in UP
and Bihar during 2007 and 2008, the [WPV1] P1 strain of polio was "on
the verge of eradication from India."

Until June 2008, the NPSP had detected only 4 cases of P1 [WPV1] this
year -- one each in Bihar, Delhi, Orissa, and Bengal. And 3 districts
in Uttar Pradesh -- Moradabad, Meerut, and Muzaffarnagar -- dubbed by
polio programme managers as the historical centre of P1 [WPV1] in
India and the toughest place in the world to eradicate polio, had not
reported P1 since November 2006.

"The P1 circulation in UP can again be stopped by aggressive use of
mOPV, while ensuring that P1 is also stopped in Bihar," Jafari said.
The IEAG had cautioned earlier this year [2008] that P1 could be
detected after several months. It P1 persists, the most likely period
for its detection would be between July to November 2008, the IEAG
had said, calling for intense surveillance.

"The mOPV has shown that P1 [WPV1] transmission can be stopped in its
stronghold," said Nicholas Grassly, an infectious disease expert at
Imperial College, London, who had published research to show that
mOPV would be better than trivalent OPV.

"There was no P1 [WPV1] transmission in western UP for 18 months,
from November 2006 until June 2008. This had never been achieved
before," Grassly told The Telegraph.

The national polio surveillance effort has detected 449 cases this
year [2008]. The number of confirmed polio cases last year was 874.

Genetic studies on poliovirus strains have shown that virtually all
of P1 [WPV1] in India originates in western Uttar Pradesh. Scientists
in Mumbai looking for poliovirus in sewage water have detected only a
single P1 [WPV1] strain since the beginning of this year [2008].

The sewage scan is intended to detect poliovirus excreted by infected
individuals in Mumbai, a city that attracts people from across the
nation. In previous years, they used to detect P1 [WPV1] several times a year.

"A decreased frequency of P1 [WPV1] in Mumbai's sewage is an
indicator of the progress the nation is making against polio," IEAG
chairman John said.

[The polio eradication website weekly report from 7 Oct 2008 has the
additional following information on India (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>):
- 15 new cases were reported in the past week (10 WPV1s and 5 WPV3s),
bringing the total number of cases for 2008 to 464. The most recent
case had onset of paralysis on [17 Sep 2008] (WPV1 from Uttar Pradesh).
- A supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) schedule for the
next 3 months is currently being finalized. The highest priority is
given to stopping the current WPV1 outbreak in western Uttar Pradesh.
- In Bihar state, a mop-up SIA with monovalent OPV type 1 (mOPV1) was
completed last week. High quality was achieved, despite the onset of
renewed heavy rains towards the end of the campaign.
- During the upcoming festival season in October and early November
[2008], which is typically associated with large-scale population
movements between Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, special transit
vaccination teams will be deployed to major travelers gathering sites
and transit points.

If one checks the table with information on wild poliovirus
identification by country (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf>)
according to information available as of 7 Oct 2008, the most recent
WPV1 identified in India was from a case with date of onset 17 Sep
2008, and most recent WPV3 identified was from a case with date of
onset 13 Sep 2008, confirming the circulation of both wild poliovirus
types in the country.

The strategy to use monovalent oral polio vaccine type 1 (mOPV1) was
implemented in India in 2004/2005 and resulted in significant
reductions in the overall numbers of cases reported as well as
appeared to have interrupted the transmission of WPV1. Not totally
unexpected, with the use of mOPV1, there was a noted shift to a
predominant wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) isolation from cases. The
present observed reappearance of WPV1 in Uttar Pradesh is disturbing.
Hopefully a renewed effort with enhanced vaccination campaigns will
be able to interrupt its transmission. (For a good information sheet
on the rationale of vaccine choice as part of the polio eradication
effort, see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/meetings/MediaMaterials_12OctMediaEvent/mOPVFactSheetfinal.2005.pdf>).

Pakistan: why is polio spreading?
---------------------------------
The refusal by parents to get their children vaccinated against polio
in Pakistan is only a minor contributory factor explaining the rise
in the number of polio cases among children, say health experts.

In the past few weeks several polio cases have been detected in the
conflict-affected Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA) and in
the North West Frontier Province (NWFP). The most recent case was
that of an Afghan child -- taking the number of cases in the NWFP and
FATA this year [2008] to 28, Pakistani media reported. Officials said
the case was confirmed by the National Institute of Health. The
9-month-old child had received 7 doses of polio drops during special
campaigns but did not get vaccinated during routine immunisation.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of polio
cases this year as of [5 Oct 2008] was 70, of which half were
registered in August and September [2008]. In 2007, 32 cases were
detected, and 40 in 2006. Pakistan, Nigeria, India, and Afghanistan
are the only 4 countries in the world where the debilitating disease
remains endemic.

Health workers attribute the recent rise in the number of cases to
the fighting between the Pakistani army and militants. "There are
many factors that are beyond the control of the polio programme,
including the security situation in NWFP/FATA and southern
Afghanistan. Recently we have seen cases in Swat. The vaccinators
have not been able to go to some of these areas to immunise children
for nearly a year due to the security situation," said Nima Abid,
WHO's polio team leader in Pakistan. The biggest hurdles in the NWFP
range from "insecurity and the low proportion of female teams, to
pockets of refusals, and lack of independent monitoring, due again to
insecurity in the area", said Abid, who also cited other factors:
"Poor service delivery in some districts and agencies, very variable
routine immunisation coverage, pockets of refusals in a few key
districts, rapid turnover of district health leaderships, and low
public demand for immunisation. Poor sanitation and high population
density, which lead to a high prevalence of diarrhoeal disease and
enteroinfections, also interfere with the uptake of the oral polio
vaccine in the intestines of children. All these factors have
hampered the eradication efforts," Abid said. "Refusal is a
significant problem in only a few districts and agencies like, Killa
Abdullah, Bajaur, Mohamand, Swat, and few others. Overall less than
one percent of the targeted children are missed because of refusals,
so it cannot be the [main] cause of the resurgence [in the number] of
polio cases. An independent study of refusals highlighted that
management and service delivery issues were also an issue," she said.

"Attention must be given to the main reasons for missed children
[during anti-polio drives]," said Chris Morry, a UN Children's Fund
(UNICEF) communication specialist, at a recent communication review
meeting organised by UNICEF. Mubina Agboatwala, in charge of the
polio clinic at Karachi's Civil Hospital, said at the meeting that it
was all down to campaign fatigue, noting that some houses had been
missed out during house-to-house calls. "This is not just true for
Sindh but all across Pakistan," she said, adding: "Strict monitoring
is the only solution." That sentiment was echoed by Abid. "Good
selection of team and field supervisors as well as close monitoring
by district management is crucial for successful campaign
implementation," she said. NWFP's minister for health, Syed Zahir Ali
Shah, expressed concern about the growing number of polio cases and
called for a policy review given that the polio cases were not only
arising in inaccessible areas. However, Abid pointed out that the
polio programme in Pakistan was not a failure as significant strides
had been made since it was launched in 1994, when the caseload was over 1000.

[The polio eradication website weekly summary of 7 Oct 2008 provides
the following additional information (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>):
- Three new cases were reported in the past week (all WPV1s),
bringing the total number of cases for 2008 to 70. The most recent
case had onset of paralysis on [18 Sept 2008] (WPV1 from Islamabad).
- To further increase population immunity levels across the country,
the planned Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) on [13-15 Oct 2008]
will now be full NIDs (National Immunization Days). These NIDs will
be of critical importance, particularly in the recently re-infected
areas of Punjab and Islamabad. With recent increases in insecurity in
some areas of the country and associated population movements,
polio-free areas across Pakistan are at increased risk of
re-infection. In Sindh, focus will be on filling operational gaps in
campaign quality.
- On [10 Oct 2008], an urgent consultation of experts will be held at
EMRO (WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office) in Cairo, Egypt, to
review the epidemiological situation and discuss ways to address the
recent increase of new polio cases affecting Pakistan.

The above newswire describes the variety of factors that are
contributing to the continued circulation of WPV in the
country. These factors include civil unrest leading to security
issues preventing vaccination teams from entering affected zones,
ineffective infrastructure impeding routine and vaccine campaign
activities, pockets of population refusing vaccinations, high
prevalence of concurrent gastrointestinal infections in the target
population that compete with the vaccine for gastrointestinal
receptor sites and "campaign fatigue" both on the part of the
vaccinators as well as the population, contributing to reduced
coverages during the campaigns.

Of interest is that if one checks the table with information on wild
poliovirus identification by country (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf>)
according to information available as of 7 Oct 2008, the most recent
WPV1 identified in Pakistan was from a case with date of onset 18 Sep
2008, and most recent WPV3 identified was from a case with date of
onset 16 Sep 2008, confirming the circulation of both wild poliovirus
types in the country similar to as seen in India.

[Additional information available at the polio eradication website
weekly update includes the following country specific information:]
Endemic countries
Afghanistan
-----------
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2008 remains 20. The most recent case had onset of
paralysis on [10 Sep 2008] (WPV1 from Kandahar).
- Preparations are ongoing for the next National Immunization Days
(NIDs) on [19-21 Oct 2008], using trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV).
Efforts will focus on increasing access to all populations,
particularly in security-compromised areas of the Southern Region.

Nigeria
-------
- 14 new cases were reported in the past week (13 WPV1s and one
WPV3), bringing the total number of cases for 2008 to 705. The most
recent case had onset of paralysis on [2 Sep 2008] (WPV1 from Kwara).
- State-level operational plans for upcoming campaigns are currently
being strengthened, strategically driven by epidemiological profiles.
- A supplementary immunization activity (SIA) calendar for the rest
of the year is in development and will be submitted for endorsement
to the Expert Review Committee for Polio Eradication and Routine
Immunization, scheduled to meet on [27-28 Oct 2008]. Currently, it is
planned to add OPV to already-planned measles SIAs in November and
December [2008], with separate Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) to be
held in high-risk areas in the north in December [2008].


Importation countries
Angola
------
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2008 remains 25. The most recent case had onset of
paralysis on [14 Jul 2008] (WPV3 from Benguela province).
- On [26-28 Sep 2008], a mop-up with monovalent OPV type 3 (mOPV3)
was held in key high-risk areas. The next NIDs will be conducted with
mOPV1 on [24-26 Oct 2008].

Central African Republic (CAR)
------------------------------
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2008 remains 2. The most recent case had onset of paralysis
on [15 Aug 2008] (WPV1 from RS3 province).
- Two nationwide campaigns have been conducted this year (2008), and
further activities are being planned.

Chad
----
- One new case was reported in the past week (WPV3), bringing the
total number of cases for 2008 to 22. The most recent case had onset
of paralysis on [21 Aug 2008] (WPV3 from Mayo-Kebbi).
- A supplementary immunization activities (SIA) schedule has been
developed. One round of staggered campaigns will be conducted in Q4
[4th quarter] 2008, in the southern and northern areas of the
country. A 2nd round, potentially also including the west and east of
the country, is scheduled for 2009.
- The risk of further spread of polio within Chad and internationally
is high, as outbreak response activities are inadequate both in
extent and quality. As many as 40 percent of children were missed in
key areas during the most recent activities in August [2008].
- High-level and local level political ownership and engagement is
urgently needed, to address the situation.

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
--------------------------------------
No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2008 remains 4. The most recent case had onset of paralysis
on [5 Aug 2008] (WPV1 from Sud-Kivu).
- Trivalent OPV was added to a measles SIA held on [18 Sep 2008],
with further activities planned for November [2008].

Horn of Africa
--------------
- One new case was reported in the past week (WPV1 from southern
Sudan), bringing the total number of cases for 2008 to 8 (one WPV3
from West Darfur, Sudan; and 7 WPV1s from the southern Sudan/western
Ethiopia cross-border area). The most recent case had onset of
paralysis on [15 Aug 2008] (WPV1 from Juba, southern Sudan).
- Large-scale outbreak response activities will be held in late
October [2008] and again in November [2008] in northern Sudan, and in
the cross-border southern Sudan/western Ethiopia area.

Nepal
-----
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2008 remains 5. The most recent case had onset of paralysis
on [27 Jul 2008] (WPV3 from Mid-West Development Region).
- The next SIA will be a mOPV3 campaign starting [26 Oct 2008].

West Africa
-----------
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for this region in 2008 remains 16 (2 in Benin, one in Burkina
Faso, and 13 in Niger). The most recent case had onset of paralysis
on [7 Jul 2008] (WPV1 from Niger).
- Following 2 synchronized SIAs in the border areas of Benin, Burkina
Faso, Mali, and Niger in June and July [2008], a 3rd round will be
conducted on [24 Oct 2008], with additional activities in November [2008].

[As can be seen in the table above and the following weekly
summaries, there are 4 endemic countries that have not as yet
interrupted transmission of wild poliovirus (Pakistan, India,
Afghanistan, and Nigeria), and 10 countries that had interrupted wild
poliovirus for 2 or more years in the recent past, but as a result of
importations, have identified wild poliovirus from cases with dates
of onset in 2008 (Chad, Sudan, Central African Republic (CAR),
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Nepal, Angola, Niger, Benin,
Burkina Faso, and Ethiopia). Of note, in this latter group of
countries with recent importations, the dates of onset of cases with
most recent WPV isolates were predominantly in June, July, and August
2008 - that is, within the last 4 months.
