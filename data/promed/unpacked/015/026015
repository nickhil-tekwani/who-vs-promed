Four Taranaki dairy herds are in isolation after testing positive for bovine tuberculosis. TB Free New Zealand says the outbreak has affected 3 herds at Inglewood and one near Opunake.

All animals infected with the disease will be culled and tested to determine what strain of TB they were afflicted with. Stock movements on and off all 4 farms are being investigated, and neighbouring herds will be tested this week.

TB Free New Zealand regional coordinator Frank Pavitt says the outbreak is a reminder the disease can crop up anywhere. "The large amount of dairy stock being shifted around Taranaki creates a potential TB risk for farmers. They simply cannot afford to place their livelihoods in jeopardy," he says.

Mr Pavitt says plans to combat the disease are already underway, but farmers should be vigilant in citing signs of TB.

[A valuable background document of the past history of bovine TB in New Zealand, is available at http://tinyurl.com/c363nx8.

To quote my colleague Tam Garland: "The AHB [Animal Health Board] worries about possums, while those in the UK worry about badgers. Reservoirs of the disease make it difficult to eradicate. And wildlife reservoirs bring a more difficult dimension to the problem.

"In brush-tailed opossums, bovine tuberculosis is usually a fulminating pulmonary disease that typically lasts 2 to 6 months. In the final stage of the disease, animals become disoriented, cannot climb, and may be seen wandering about in daylight. In contrast, most infected badgers have no visible lesions and can survive for many years. In symptomatic badgers, bovine tuberculosis is primarily a respiratory disease."

Once this strain has been genotyped, it will be clearer how these 4 herds became infected. It is a characteristic of extremely low prevalence for tests to throw up novel results, such as from soil mycobacterial infections. So while the NZ are doing all the correct control responses, in the meanwhile one should be prepared for something different. - Mod MHJ]
