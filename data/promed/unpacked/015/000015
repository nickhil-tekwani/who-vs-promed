Another outbreak of anthrax in Victoria's Goulburn Valley
-------------------------------------------------
The Department of Primary Industries has confirmed that 8 head of
cattle have died in the past week on neighbouring properties at
Tatura. Surrounding landholders have been informed and advised to
vaccinate their cattle against the fatal disease. Authorities are
confident the outbreak has been contained.

Anthrax has struck the Goulburn Valley again, with an outbreak west
of Tatura killing 8 cattle between Thursday and Monday. Department
of Primary Industries senior veterinary officer George Miller said 2
neighbouring properties were involved and had been quarantined. Mr
Miller confirmed the cases were in the same outbreak area of 1997.
One of the properties had been afflicted by the disease previously,
while the other had not.
Mr Miller said a local veterinarian was called on Thursday afternoon
[11 Mar 2004] to investigate a possible anthrax case. He said the
veterinarian had been "pretty sure" it was anthrax, and the DPI was
called to conduct tests, which confirmed the disease's presence on
Friday. "They are only young cattle, so there is no concern for the
milk industry," Mr Miller said.
The 2 farms, which will be quarantined for 42 days, have a combined
total of about 120 20-month-old heifers. He said it was impossible
to know where the cattle had picked up the disease. "It has been
quite dry and dusty, so the cattle could have got it from licking
soil -- cattle normally ingest up to 10 kg of soil per day," Mr
Miller said. [Actually it is more like 2-3 kg. - Mod.MHJ] "The
disease is normally associated with hot and dry weather, but it is
not necessarily the only time -- the last case from the area was in
winter." He said it was also possible that work on a nearby
irrigation channel could have disturbed the [spores], which can live
in soil for up to a decade.
The infected carcasses were burned, and the remaining cattle were
vaccinated. Mr Miller said it was possible there could be further
deaths as the disease and vaccine both have a 10-day incubation
period. Anthrax is caused by the spore-forming bacteria _Bacillus
anthracis_ and is usually contracted through animals eating the
spores. The last major outbreak in the Goulburn Valley, in 1997,
affected 83 properties, took 2 months to clear up, and resulted in
the death of 206 animals. The most recent death was in August 2003,
when a 3-year-old dairy cow died in the Tatura district.

Sporadic Anthrax Incident in Victoria - 17 Mar 2004
-------------------------------------------------
Anthrax has been confirmed as the cause of death of 7 cattle that
died over a 4-day period (10-14 Mar 2004) on a farm (Farm 1) in the
Goulburn Valley. A single case occurred on an adjacent farm (Farm 2)
during the same period. There have been earthworks between both farms
associated with water drainage channels that may account for the
incident. The incident has occurred in an area where anthrax has
occurred previously and where occasional cases are not unexpected.
Farm 1 has never recorded a case; Farm 2 had a case back in 1997.
The following response actions have been taken in accordance with
Victorian and national protocols for anthrax control (starting
immediately from the time anthrax was suspected):
(i) quarantine has been applied to both farms; the quarantine will
remain in place until 42 days after vaccination or 21 days after the
last case, whichever is the later date;
(ii) all carcasses have been incinerated on-site;
(iii) all cattle on both farms were vaccinated on 11 Mar 2004; and
(iv) local agencies and key industry contacts have been advised of
the situation.
No cattle have been moved off either property during the past 20
days, so there is no need to trace cattle movements and no
implications for meat safety. Both properties are outblocks used to
hold young heifers prior to first calving.
These were not milking cattle; there are no implications for milk or
dairy products.
The fact that 8 young cattle have died of anthrax over 4 days
indicates that a number of heifers were exposed to anthrax bacteria
in a short period. The history on both properties is that there was a
single death around the start of March 2004 and neither of these
cattle was tested for anthrax. If these animals died of anthrax,
contact of herd mates with the carcasses explains the subsequent
deaths. Protection against anthrax occurs around 7-10 days after
vaccination. DPI animal health staff are closely monitoring the
remaining cattle on both farms.
Action taken by DPI thus far means there are no public health
implications or issues in relation to the safety of livestock, meat,
or dairy products from the area.
Of particular note are the useful results being obtained from the
trial of a rapid anthrax field test kit. The test kit involves an
immunochromatographic assay that detects the protective antigen of
_B. anthracis_ and is being evaluated by DPI Victoria in
collaboration with the US Naval and Medical Research Centre. The kit
can be used in the field and provides a rapid diagnosis within 15
minutes. All cases in Victoria are confirmed by culture, but the
assay has demonstrated itself to be both highly sensitive (using
culture as the gold standard) and highly specific. Results of
specificity trials will be published in the Australian Veterinary
Journal in April 2004.

[Hugh Millar in his covering note mentioned: "Please find attached a
report on the anthrax incident in Victoria referred to in your email.
It is, as you say, not a novel event but an additional sporadic case
in an area known to be at risk. Action was swift once a diagnosis was
made, but it would appear the index case was missed -- the history
showed an unexplained/untested death some 10 days earlier. No deaths
for 3 days now, vaccinated both herds 6 days ago." Hugh's quick and
complete report is much appreciated.
A number of lessons are to be learnt from this event.
Firstly, sporadic events sporadically occur. This is an ongoing
concern but not a major problem in the Goulburn valley. Until the
various scattered contaminated sites go apathogenic, there will be
the pitter-patter of anthrax cases. Final eradication depends on
dealing with them promptly and efficiently so they don't reseed the
soil with spores.
Secondly, with sporadic cases both farmers and vets don't think first
of anthrax as a possible cause of sudden deaths and as a result
outbreaks, like this one, can be bigger than they ought to be;
ignored anthrax deaths can rear up and provide multiple cases until
the cause is perceived. This pattern can result in prolonged
persistence instead of the disease disappearing. The casual handling
of occasional livestock deaths also argues for ongoing vaccination;
therefore with vaccination when deaths occur and are ignored, it
won't have been anthrax. This diagnostic delay has been seen in many
places around the world, for example in Russia and South Africa, each
time with expensive results. Interestingly, where anthrax is
enzootic, it is over-diagnosed, which makes ranchers doubt control
procedures.
Thirdly, prior ignored deaths are not uncommon with this disease.
Therefore when a diagnosis is made, the farm is already in the second
wave of cases, with another wave of animals silently incubating
disease. Vaccination cannot prevent these, as normally deaths stop
only from the 8th day onwards. We have found that the best response
at recognition is to immediately inject all possibly exposed stock
with long-acting antibiotics, e.g., LA200, to stop those incubating
infections and to vaccinate 7-10 days later with Sterne (it is a live
vaccine sensitive to antibiotics) when the circulating levels of
antibiotics are minimal.
Fourthly, as the disease gets less and less frequent, it is now usual
to see histories as with these cases where there has been earth
moving -- bulldozed new roads, ditched clearing, installing buried
water pipes to drinking troughs in pastures -- which at some point
has gone through where an animal was buried or left in the past.
Therefore if such activities are considered for a field where there
has been anthrax in the past, even when there have been no cases for
some years, it is a worthwhile precaution to vaccinate the stock when
they are allowed back in.
Lastly, I am glad to hear of their success with the US Navy test kit.
When the cases are fresh it works extremely well and ensures farmer
and rancher participation in a proper cleanup and disposal of any
carcasses. We have used it in many countries. The problem is that it
depends on the PA titre in the bloody fluids, and this titre falls
off with time such that carcasses over 3 days old can be negative
though culture-positive. For fresh cases it is unbeatable. - Mod.MHJ]
