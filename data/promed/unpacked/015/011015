Samples from 150 patients who have been given living pig tissue are being
analysed to see if they contain pig viruses. If they show no infection, the
Cambridge-based transplant company Imutran will go ahead with a phased
programme of experiments that may lead to the first kidney transplant from
its genetically engineered pig within five years. Imutran scientists believe
the risks are small and that pig organs are the solution to growing waiting
lists for transplants.
An informal moratorium has so far prevented pig-to-human transplants,
prompted by fears that retroviruses might infect the organ recipients, in
the worst case causing an epidemic.
The current study is in co-operation with the Centres for Disease Control in
Atlanta, Georgia, and involves samples from 150 patients out of hundreds
worldwide who have had emergency treatments placing them in direct contact
with living pig tissue. These include patients who have their blood perfused
through pigs' spleens, kidneys or livers, to provide temporary support to
their own failing organs, or who have received transplants of pig skin or
the islet cells from the pancreas to treat diabetes.
Results should be ready by July. Imutran scientists are also examining
monkeys that have been given pig organs to see if they are infected by the
retroviruses.
If the human samples show any sign of the retrovirus crossing the species
barrier into man, the company will review its strategy, Corinne Savill of
Imutran said. If not, they will proceed to a small trial in which patients
with liver failure will be hooked to a transgenic pig liver for up to 48
hours. The pig's liver will be used as a "liver dialysis" machine, without
actually being transplanted. If that works, and has no ill-effects, then a
series of kidney transplants will be carried out.
