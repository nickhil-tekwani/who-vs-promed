Influenza, bird-to-human - China (Hong Kong) (22)]
I think it is crucial to remember that the first mortality was due to
Reye's syndrome, not directly to influenza. It seems from our vantage
point that there is some panic setting in among the media which will not
slow down transmission at all. So it is worthy to emphasize we have one
single influena-related mortality. To reiterate: children with influenza
should NOT be given salicylates.

[Dr. Kimball makes an excellent point with regard to salicylates. I was
not aware that one of the patients had died with Reye's syndrome. What was
the source of that information?
No question this Hong Kong experience is being widely covered by the
various media, world-wide. This sort of thing can be overdone, of course,
but to be taken by surprise by an epidemic of H5N1 would even more
annoying. Can't hurt anything to passively monitor the situation.
Remarkably, I have yet to see an irresponsible statement in the press or on
TV or radio. The Program to Monitor Emerging Diseases (ProMED-mail) will
continue to report what we receive about this "experiment of nature". --
