Viet Nam finds new strains of bird flu viruses
----------------------------------------------
Vietnamese scientists have found more variations of bird flu viruses in
poultry, adding to the health risk to people if these strains are allowed
to keep circulating, a health official said on Wednesday [16 Nov 2005].
Dong Manh Ha, director of the Ho Chi Minh City Regional Animal Health
Centre, told Reuters on Wednesday [16 Nov 2005] a study conducted by the
center found new avian influenza strains of the H3 and H4 subtypes in poultry.
Scientists say strains of the H3 and H4 subtypes are capable of causing
death in birds but are generally less virulent and spread more slowly than
the H5 subtype they fear could trigger a human pandemic.
The H5N1 virus is endemic in poultry in several countries in Asia and has
killed 64 people, including 42 in Viet Nam, since late 2003 [By 16 Nov
2005, the figure is higher, following the confirmation of cases in China].
Experts fear that H5N1 could mutate into a form that passes easily among
people, triggering a pandemic.
"The presence of more subtypes of the flu virus in poultry make the virus
all the more dangerous," Ha said, adding that samples had been sent to a
World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) [reference] laboratory in
Australia for further investigation. State media reports said the new virus
strains are H3N4 and H4N5.
Viet Nam is tackling more than a dozen H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and has
stepped up culling in its 2 main cities. The virus is highly virulent and
can kill poultry in a matter of hours. It has killed about half the people
it has infected.
Hong Kong infectious disease expert Lo Wing-lok said that, with heightened
surveillance, it was not surprising for them to find other subtypes, such
as H3 and H4, though these are not generally thought of as being highly
pathogenic.
But Lo, a member of a scientific committee on zoonotic and emerging
diseases in Hong Kong, said that if the strains are allowed to spread in
poultry, people who are in close contact with these birds would be at risk.
There was also the risk of these subtypes mixing and exchanging genetic
material with the H5N1 virus. There would then be the possibility of the
H3N4 and H4N5 strains becoming more pathogenic.
Influenza type A viruses, which include human and avian flu viruses, are
categorized by H and N components, which denote specific types of proteins
on their surface. The H component governs the ability of the virus to bind
to and enter cells, which become virus-making factories. The N component
governs the release of the newly made viruses from the animal host cell.
There are 16 H subtypes and 9 N subtypes. Human influenza viruses are
usually strains of H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2, but avian flu subtypes H5 and H7
can also infect people. 13 of Viet Nam's 64 provinces have now had
outbreaks of H5N1 since the virus reappeared last month [Oct 2005].
Media reports said 2 more people in Hanoi, a 15 year old girl and a 71 year
old woman, were in the hospital with symptoms of bird flu and were being
tested. The latest cases bring to 5 the number of suspected infections in
Viet Nam.
The Agriculture Ministry said the H5N1 virus had hit 3 more provinces: the
central province of Quang Ngai and the northern provinces of Vinh Phuc and
Bac Ninh. [map at

Nation on high alert for bird flu
---------------------------------
China has strengthened supervision and monitoring on bird flu, as new cases
of the epidemic outbreak were reported in 2 counties of northwestern
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Tuesday [15 Nov 2005].
China's National Avian Flu Reference Laboratory confirmed the virus, which
was found in dead fowl sent from some family farms in Zepu Country and
Urumqi County, both in southern Xinjiang. It was the deadly H5N1 strain of
bird flu, said the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) on Tuesday [15 Nov 2005].
In the 2 bird-flu-hit counties, a total of 322 500 family birds within a
radius of 3 km have been culled, and poultry and products markets within 10
km have been closed, the ministry said. [See further remark on the
biosecurity measures applied by culling teams. - Mod.AS]
"The epidemic is basically put under control," said Qian Zhi, Vice chairman
of Xinjiang, adding the 2 counties have bought a large quantity of vaccine,
protective suits and disinfectors to prevent the spread of the disease.
The local government in Xinjiang launched its quick-response mechanism in a
timely manner, blockading the epidemic zone immediately and disinfecting
the people, vehicles and relevant goods going in and out. All the poultry
in the epidemic zone have been killed and disposed of, and all the poultry
markets within 10 km of the epidemic zone have been closed.
Xinjiang's new cases have aroused great attention across the country, as
just one day ago, the MOA announced another highly pathogenic bird flu
outbreak at a village near Huainan city of east China's Anhui Province,
which involved nearly 130 000 fowl killed. The ministry has sent expert
panels and supervision teams to Anhui and Xinjiang to assist epidemic control.
Other provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have strengthened
monitoring on poultry farms and migrant birds, which are said to be
carriers of the deadly disease virus. South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region has set up special monitoring stations at its 8 counties
bordering Viet Nam, which is also suffering from bird flu.
In addition, Guangxi's health departments have resumed the monitoring on
fever cases in hospitals and started to vaccinate the disease-vulnerable
population, such as the elderly, children, medical workers and poultry
farmers, traders and butchers. [Presumably, applying the standard
human-strain, inactivated vaccine; confirmation requested. - Mod.AS]
In the eastern province of Fujian, the provincial forestry department has
set up 24 monitoring stations for migrant birds in their major habitats.
The stations are required to make a daily report on whether there are
abnormal deaths of migrant birds.
In Changchun, provincial capital of north east China's Jilin Province, the
government has started to vaccinate pigeons in the city out of fear of the
disease spreading via the bird. The quarantine related to the epidemic was
lifted in Tianchang City of Anhui and Xiangtan County of central China's
Hunan Province on Tuesday [15 Nov 2005]; bird flu outbreaks were reported
in Wantang Village, Xiangtan County on 18 Oct 2005 and in Tianchang on 20
Oct 2005, respectively. All signs of the bird flu there have been
eradicated, and no new bird flu cases have been reported in the last 21
days in the 2 places after a 3 week isolation, according to the MOA.
At Wantang Village of Xiangtan county, veterinary staff and villagers
celebrated the end of the quarantine by burning their protective suits and
warning banners that had been used to cordoned off the area. The live
poultry markets in a 10 km radius from the affected region were also
allowed to reopen.
Despite the victory, the provinces of Anhui and Huhan have kept a close eye
on the formerly affected areas to avoid reoccurrence of the disease.

It has been indicated recently that there are suitable receptors for avian
influenza virus in the human eye, and based on analogies with other ocular
viruses sharing the same receptor specificity, it is suggested that the eye
may be a portal of entry for avian influenza virus (see 20051104.3231).
The use of goggles by sanitary teams engaged in the control activities of
HPAI in affected premises, initially prescribed during the 2003 outbreak in
the Netherlands, is strongly recommended. - Mod.AS]

Indonesia must step up bird flu fight, top EU health official says
------------------------------------------------------------------
Indonesia has to intensify its fight against bird flu, the European Union's
top health official said on Wednesday [15 Nov 2005], warning that promises
of action must be followed up on. EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou
said the government appears to have the political will to contain the
disease that has recently spread from Asia, where it has killed 64 people,
to Europe.
Now, it has to come up with detailed plans, from ways to monitor hundreds
of millions of backyard chickens to guidelines for culling and
vaccinations, and take steps to implement them. "It will not be an easy
task," said Kyprianou, noting the high density of chickens and people in
the sprawling archipelago.
"Indonesia will need foreign assistance ... But I have to say, we can help,
but we can't do it for them."
The virulent H5N1 strain of bird flu has, in the past 2 years, ravaged
poultry stocks across South East Asia, where all of the human deaths have
occurred, including at least 5 in Indonesia.
Most human victims have contracted the disease from sick birds, but experts
fear the virus will mutate into a form that is easily transmitted between
people, sparking a possible pandemic that could kill millions worldwide.
Indonesia was criticized for moving too slowly when bird flu 1st appeared
in poultry stocks in 2003, but has promised in recent days to step up the
fight.
Even the military was getting involved, with President Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono saying thousands of troops would join students and volunteers in
going door-to-door in search of sick birds.
Still, the government has refused to slaughter all poultry in bird-flu
infected areas, which experts claim is the best way to contain the spread
of the virus, opting instead for mass vaccinations of chickens. Indonesia
says it cannot afford to compensate farmers [for culled livestock].
Kyprianou said he understood the government's dilemma, but cautioned
vaccination alone "is not a long term solution." A combination of culling
and vaccinations is recommended. The virus has recently infected birds in
Europe, putting that continent on edge as well. Kyprianou said the
international community saw the importance of helping stamp out the disease
in developing countries, reports the AP.

Bird flu virus in Caraorman, Romania
------------------------------------
After local authorities believed they had eradicated bird flu in the Danube
Delta, and after life began to return to normal following the hysteria
generated a month ago, avian flu again has attacked the villages of the delta.
On Monday [14 Nov 2005] morning, the veterinary lab in Tulcea, Romania
confirmed the presence of the bird flu virus in birds that died several
days ago in a village called Caraorman. Caraorman, the village where last
week [2nd week Nov 2005] a lot of domestic birds died, is in the heart of
the Danube Delta, 13 miles away from Sulina city. [map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RO/0/Caraorman.html>].
There is suspicion of a new phase of development of the virus, manifested
in hot zone epidemic areas and based on a high mortality ratio for both
wild and domestic birds in the delta.
In the villages Partizani, Caraorman and Crisan, in the past days, hundreds
of birds have died. Near Sulina, 100 swans have been found dead. Marian
Avram, head of the Sanitary-Veterinary authority in Tulcea, said that, at
this moment, lab analysis confirmed the presence of the bird flu virus only
for chickens dead in Caraorman, but they have another 200 samples to
analyze, therefore the numbers could rise.
Troops are ready for quarantine procedures, Lefter Chirica, a Tulcea county
official, declared. The Caraorman village is rather small, making
quarantine procedures easy. There are 110 households with 1800 birds.
Officials say that teams are ready to kill the birds in just a couple of
hours. Food is also ready to be distributed to locals. Such supplies were
also prepared after interventions in the villages of Ceamurlia de Jos,
Maliuc and Vulturu. The villagers will receive a total of about USD 20 000
for the eventual killing of their birds.

[Details on the 2 affected holdings in Caraorman are included in the
official Romanian report sent on 16 Nov 2005 to the OIE (Office
International des Epizooties), accessible at
<http://oie.int/downld/AVIAN%20INFLUENZA/Romania%20Follow%20up%20No7.pdf>.
The need to provide a food supply to the villagers in Caraorman is an
outcome of the severe quarantine measures laid out in the report: "The
village was placed under official control, and the stamping out is
performed. The stamping out is applied to all birds within the affected
village; the quarantine (all transports of people, animals, poultry,
poultry products, feed, etc is prohibited; restriction measures are being
applied to the entire affected village) was set up; the disinfection of
backyards premises and roads in the village is performed. The culling is
made by gassing poultry with CO2 in containers. The destruction of corpses
is assured through burning and burying." - Mod.AS]
