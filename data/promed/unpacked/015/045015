The Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak in Eastern Lakes state, South Sudan, has grown to 32 cases and 4 deaths, according to a World Health Organization (WHO) update published this week.

During the past week, a 17-year-old male who presented to hospital on 19 Feb 2018 with a history of fever, headache, and joint pain that started the same day. On 21 Feb 2018, he vomited coffee grounds and frank blood, passed melena stools, lost consciousness, and died the same day. The case was positive for malaria by rapid diagnostic testing and a blood sample collected from the case was obtained for RVF testing. The deaths of goats and a cow have been reported in the neighborhood of the case.

Overall, a total of 32 suspected RVF cases have been reported, including 5 confirmed cases (one of which was IgG and IgM positive and 4 which were IgG-only positive).

Of 28 animal samples collected, one sample taken from a cow showed high RVF IgG titres indicative of previous RVF infection, 6 tested negative for RVF, and 21 samples are pending testing. Since the beginning of the outbreak, goats, sheep, and cattle in the area have shown evidence of zoonotic hemorrhagic illness and abortions in livestock, disease in cattle, and wild bird die-offs have been reported in the outbreak area.

WHO says the suspected RVF outbreak in South Sudan continues to be closely monitored, and there is a continued need for support to strengthen national capacity for RVF preparedness, surveillance, and response.

Rift Valley fever is a mosquito-borne [viral disease] that is endemic in parts of Africa, including South Africa. It primarily infects animals like sheep, cattle, and goats and it can have an economic impact on a community due to the loss of livestock.

Humans get infected through contact with infected animal blood or organs. Butchering and slaughtering of animals is a primary cause of transmission to humans. Certain occupations are at a higher risk of getting Rift Valley fever like farmers, herders, and veterinarians.

It can also be transmitted to humans through mosquito bites and the bites of blood-sucking flies.

Most cases of Rift Valley fever are mild and symptoms include fever, headaches, and muscle pain. However, a small percentage of people can get serious disease, which includes retinitis, encephalitis, and a hemorrhagic fever. Fatalities happen in less than 1 percent of those infected.

[A recent release of information by the WHO also mentions the fatal human case and the seropositive cow. It also mentions that as of 24 Feb 2018, there were no cases hospitalized in Yirol East county (Eastern Lakes state). During the week, 8 human samples tested negative for Ebola, Marburg, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, RVF, and Sosuga viruses by PCR at the Uganda Viral Research Institute (UVRI). Serology testing of these samples for RVF is ongoing.

Overall, a total of 32 suspected RVF cases have been reported, including 5 confirmed cases (one of which was IgG and IgM positive and 4 which were IgG-only positive), 3 probable cases who died, 12 suspected cases for whom complete laboratory results are pending (one of whom died), and 12 cases who were considered as non-cases following negative laboratory results for RVF. Excluding non-cases, the majority of suspected cases have been women (60 percent; 12/20), and individuals aged 20-39 years have comprised the majority (60 percent of cases (https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/OEW9-24022032018.pdf).

This outbreak now involves people and a variety of domestic animals. Fortunately, help is being provided to deal with this outbreak. A team of 27 volunteers is working in close collaboration with the active case search team to engage the community and conduct risk communication.

Case searching and community mobilization have been activated in Awerial county following reports of cases and deaths of animals: between 16 and 26 Jan 2018, community mobilizers identified several cases in various locations. An understanding of the risks of handling infected animals is essential in avoiding more human cases. A vaccine is available for animals, although there is no mention of animal vaccination in this report.

As mentioned earlier, there have been undiagnosed cases of hemorrhagic disease in South Sudan several times before. In 2016, there was an outbreak of hemorrhagic disease. Unfortunately, despite the efforts of several reference laboratories, the etiological agent of that South Sudan hemorrhagic fever outbreak was not determined. In that outbreak, several possible viruses were discarded by laboratory tests (see Undiagnosed hemorrhagic illness - South Sudan (02): addtl. information 20160625.4309572). It is difficult to know whether these earlier outbreaks were due to RVF or to something else.
