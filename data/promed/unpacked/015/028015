On [31 Mar 2017], a notice was placed in a Kingston [Ontario] apartment building on Village Drive, near Montreal Street and John Counter Boulevard, stating that KFL&A [Kingston, Frontenac, and Lennox & Addington] Public Health has confirmed someone living in the building has a case of the measles. The building is large for Kingston, with 120 units and 10 floors.

Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be transmitted through air, including ventilations systems. Therefore, the notice reads, residents of the building who are not protected against measles are recommended to contact the public health unit.

Public Health says that the illness was discovered in a person who recently travelled to South Asia. The agency worked closely with local physicians and with Public Health Ontario Laboratory to identify and to confirm the case. Measles is common in the part of the world that the patient visited, and poses a risk both to travellers to that area and to local residents when a case is imported on return to Canada.

"Being up-to-date with all routine immunisations, especially measles, is the easiest and most effective way to ensure that one does not contract a serious infectious disease while travelling, and to ensure that one is protected if by bad luck one is exposed to a returning traveller who is ill", said Dr Ian Gemmill, Medical Officer of Health for KFL&A Public Health. "Routine immunisation, including measles vaccine, is free of charge for all residents, and having a case imported to our area is a strong reminder to make sure that we all have taken advantage of this safe and effective way of protecting ourselves when a case of measles turns up in this community".

[While measles has been eliminated in Canada, with the last domestically acquired case in 1997, Canadians who are unvaccinated or under-vaccinated can still contract the disease through infected people who travel into the country, or through Canadians who travel outside the country. This individual traveled somewhere in South Asia.

There have been 10 confirmed cases of measles in Canada to date in 2017.

[2] Europe (Italy)
Date: Tue 4 Apr 2017
From: Franco Giovanetti <fgiovanetti@alscn2.it> [edited]


Italy is facing a measles outbreak: from 1 Jan-2 Apr [2017], as many as 1333 cases have been notified, mainly among adolescents and adults.

An update in English is available on the website of the National Health Institute at http://www.epicentro.iss.it/problemi/morbillo/bollettino/Measles_WeeklyReport_N2eng.pdf

After measles vaccine introduction, immunization rates remained very low in Italy for years, showing a great variability among regions, with the lowest rates in the Southern part of the country. The percentage of 2 year-old children vaccinated against measles was consistently below 21 percent before 1988, increased to 5 percent in the 1990s, reaching 74 percent in the year 2000, then increased to 90.1 percent in 2011. Since 2012, a vaccine-autism controversy started in Italy and, consequently, immunization rates fell below 90 percent.

The ongoing outbreak is due both to the persistence of susceptibility pockets among adults and to suboptimal immunization rates among children.

[ProMED thanks F Giovanetti for submitting this report on measles in Italy. The anti-vaccination voices appear to be prevailing over scientific data backing the safety of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine.

Also see report in ProMED Measles update (16) 20170401.4941388 for slightly discrepant case numbers in Italy and Measles update (13) 20170319.4910476 for discussion of the lack of vaccination coverage in Italy.

[3] Europe (Portugal)

There are 2 cases of measles confirmed in Portugal, a person who came from Venezuela recently [when? Would it be an imported case? - Mod.RNA] and an 11-month-old baby who is not yet old enough to be vaccinated, but these are 2 isolated situations with no temporal relation between them, says the deputy director general of Health [DGS], Graça Freitas, who, for now, removes any scenario of an outbreak of this highly contagious disease in the country.

Nevertheless Freitas asks people who do not have the measles virus vaccine to be immunized. It is also worth mentioning that health centers are already calling the children who are not up to date with their vaccines so that the immunization can be done. The DGS advises those who are not vaccinated to do so and also recommends the vaccine to all people who are traveling or participating in international events.

The DGS also stresses that this is not an outbreak in Portugal, at least for now, contrary to what is happening in several other European countries. The multiplication of measles cases, a very contagious disease among children, prompted an alert from the WHO on [Tue 28 Mar 2017]. Since the beginning of this year [2017] cases of measles have been detected in Europe and are affecting 7 countries (Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, and Ukraine).

Preventable by vaccination, measles is controlled in Portugal and WHO has stated that the country officially eliminated the virus last year [2016]. "Eliminated does not mean that Portugal cannot have cases [from] another country. It is normal for Portugal to have isolated cases," emphasizes Freitas.

"The vaccination coverage rate ranges from 95 to 97 percent in Portugal, it is very high, but there are small community clusters of unvaccinated people in certain areas and populations. When [lack of vaccination] is detected, the central service calls the regional services who then contact the health center to invite people to be vaccinated," explains the DGS.

In the event of an outbreak, and if there is a risk to public health, vaccination may become mandatory. At that time, it may be considered to anticipate the vaccination of children to 6 months of age or even earlier, "it will even be possible to protect them with immunoglobulin," adds the doctor.

In Portugal, almost all adults are immunized because either they had the disease as children or because they have been vaccinated and coverage rate is very high among children, unlike in some countries because there is no organized anti-vaccination movement.

All the cases reported in the 3 sections above originated with travel to/from countries where measles is endemic, highlighting the importance of the complete series of MMR vaccine, even when living in a country that is considered measles-free. - Mod.LK]
