Monsoon heralds the season of death in Poorvanchal [Purvanchal,
eastern Uttar Pradesh]. With the deadly combo of Japanese encephalitis
[JE] and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) claiming its 106 victim
last Friday [22 Jul 2011], the scenario threatens to turn ugly once
again this year.

BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur is overflowing with patients pouring
in from neighbouring districts of Siddharthnagar, Maharajganj,
Kushinagar, Sant Kabirnagar, Deoria, Maharajganj, Gonda, and from
Bihar and neighbouring Nepal as well.

The rice bowl of UP has lost nearly 3500 lives to the vicious killers
over the past 6 years. And though health officials celebrate the
'statistical victory' that JE figures have plummeted to a mere 2 per
cent from 35.88 per cent as reported in 2005, the sudden spurt in AES
cases has them in knots.

Experts explain, "AES is a severe neurological condition with high
mortality rate. For the semi-literate or illiterate victims and their
families, it is a "plain mystery fever that brings sure death." The
virus, which has moved into the killer slot, could prove particularly
worrisome this year [2011]. It has already overtaken JE much before
the peak season in August.

"Cases of AES, which has no vaccine have shown a definite climb this
year," said Dr SP Ram director general health UP. Talking to TOI, Dr
Ram said that 85 AES deaths have been reported in UP till July [2011].
The number last year [2010] at this time of year was 75. In contrast,
the casualty figure of JE reads 21. The official attributes the later
phenomenon largely to a sustained vaccination programme. The bigger
issue of how the department proposes to tackle the AES, however,
leaves him floundering.

Admitting that the particular strain has not been identified, Dr Ram
said, "The National Institute of Virology is working on it . It could
be an enterovirus, meningitis, malaria, or any other water-borne
virus," he said, and added that the process could take time.

Then there have been other attempts like the visit by an expert team
from Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta. The team took
150 samples, but forgot to send the report or the pilot project in
Kushinagar undertaken by the Union Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare for prevention and control of AES, which sources say is
largely confined to papers.

"The state health department has launched an awareness campaign to
introduce the populace to hygiene and cleanliness practice and written
to the chief secretary UP to sanction mark 2 hand pumps for the
affected belt to ensure safe drinking water," Dr Ram said. Whether
this would ever become a priority agenda with a government busy
fire-fighting at this time, remains a mute point though.

"The only lasting solution is to declare JE eradication a national
programme like the malaria or polio eradication programmes," says Dr
RN Singh, convener of the encephalitis eradication movement in
Gorakhpur. Dr Singh is leading a campaign to make JE an election issue
this time. "With 125 MLAs [members of the legislative assembly] out of
403 hailing from Poorvanchal, what is needed is a committed push," he
said.

[It is encouraging to learn that the Indian National Institute of
Virology and, apparently, the USA CDC are attempting to determine the
etiology of the acute encephalitis syndrome cases that are not
Japanese encephalitis virus infections. Eradication of Japanese
encephalitis virus in its endemic cycle in wild birds and _Culex_
mosquitoes is not possible with currently available control measures.
An aggressive and sustained vaccination program could reduce human
cases significantly.
