Azeri Today reports, with reference to Panorama.am, that since about a month, a disease has been affecting livestock in the villages of Debet and Dsegh in the Lori region. As the heads of village communities and the villagers themselves assure, the animals are infected with foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], since all the symptoms testify to this disease.

According to the head of the community, Deborah Ararat Kocharyan, the focus of the disease are the Dsegh mountains, adjacent to their community.

They say that about 60 percent of the livestock population is infected with FMD in the village (more than 700 animals).

Foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] has been spreading since several days in the villages of Debet and Dsegh in the north of Armenia. This was told to the Armenian News correspondent by Ashot Ghazaryan, member of the Council of Elders in Debet. According to him, out of 800 head of cattle in the village, more than 500 are infected. No mortalities have been reported yet.

Currently, employees of the regional department of the Food Safety Service are investigating the event in the village; the Service has not yet confirmed infection.

[On 19 Jan 2016, Armenia reported to the OIE an outbreak of FMD virus serotype A, topotype Asia, genotype VII, in the province of Armavir near the border with Turkey. The outbreak had reportedly started on 23 Dec 2015. According to later official information, the said initial outbreak on the Armenian-Turkish border remained solitary. Mass vaccination was applied. Media reports on additional outbreaks (including one from Lori) were not confirmed.

According to Armenia's page from the WRLFMD (Pirbright; see at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/arm.htm), the following FMDV serotypes have been recorded in Armenia in the past:

FMDV-O: 1983-1984, 1996-1997, 2000
FMDV-A: 1970, 1984, 1998, 2006, 2015
FMDV-Asia 1: 1984-1985, 2000

Confirmation or otherwise of the current suspected circulation of FMD in north Armenia is anticipated. In case confirmed, information on the serotype of the causative and involved species will be appreciated.
