Third viral gastroenteritis outbreak reported on cruise ship
------------------------------------------------------------
About 180 passengers and crew on the Holland America cruise ship Amsterdam
came down with a contagious but brief [gastroenteritis] virus that spoiled
their Caribbean vacations over the past week, the third straight sailing in
which the ship has had a sizeable viral [gastroenteritis] outbreak.
Rose Abello, company vice president of public relations, said that the ship
had been cleaned thoroughly after all 3 of the trips, and contended that
the 1300 passengers aboard each one were the source of the outbreak. The
virus -- a [Norwalk-like virus] -- is spread via contaminated food or
water, or through contact with infected people or things they have touched.
"The ship is not sick. There are sick people getting on the ship," Abello
said. But federal health officials who oversee cruise ships have reported
no other significant outbreaks on other vessels. And Holland America had an
outbreak of Norwalk-like virus aboard another of its ships, the Ryndam,
where 176 people were stricken during a July cruise in Alaska.
Gastrointestinal illness is not common on cruise ships, but outbreaks
occasionally happen. Cruise lines are required to report them to the US
Public Health Service, which may investigate and order changes. Out of 1905
people on the Amsterdam, the virus gave 163 of the ship's primarily elderly
passengers and 18 crew members one to 2 days of diarrhea, vomiting, and
stomach pains. Symptoms normally are mild, but can be acute and more
serious among frail seniors and people with other illnesses.
Passengers on the cruise that returned to Port Everglades on Monday morning
said they were angry that they were given little or no advance warning
about the outbreak before the ship sailed on Fri 1 Nov 2002 on a 10 day
voyage to the southern and eastern Caribbean. In the materials that
passengers got when boarding the ship, the cruise line included an 8
sentence letter saying the virus was reported on board, and urging people
to wash their hands often. Some passengers said they were told nothing
about the outbreak until the lifeboat drill, when the ship was hours out to
sea.
The Amsterdam saw its first case of the virus during a 3 week cruise from
Seattle to Port Everglades, when the cruise line moved the ship from Alaska
to the Caribbean for the winter, Abello said. About 32 people were stricken
during that trip. The crew scrubbed the ship from ceiling to floor with a
bleach solution, following a clean-up plan approved by the public health
service. "Every ceiling tile, every banister, every poker chip, every towel
was cleaned," Abello said.
On its next cruise, which sailed to the Caribbean on 22 Oct 2002, the ship
logged 41 cases of the virus. Abello said federal health inspectors ruled
out the ship's food and water systems as the source of the virus and
cleared the ship to sail on Fri 1 Nov 2002. Officials of the health agency
could not be reached for comment on Monday due to the Veteran's Day
holiday. Abello said the cruise line was in contact with the agency, but no
federal officials were on board. On the latest trip, Abello said 21 people
became sick as of the ship's stop on Thursday in St Thomas. The 21 and 23
companions were flown home at company expense, in hopes of "breaking the
cycle" of the virus [infection], she said.
On board, there were signs everywhere asking passengers to wash their hands
and avoid personal contact. [A passenger, one] of about 150 from the
Tamarac Bridge Club, said players were given new cards daily as old ones
were thrown away. Salt and pepper shakers were replaced in dining rooms
with packets. Food workers in the crew work in plastic gloves at all times.
Despite such precautions, about 140 passengers got sick in the last 2 days
of the cruise. Said Abello: "We were very surprised by the most recent
outbreak." Sick passengers overflowed the ship's infirmary, passengers
said. The crew asked them and companions to voluntarily remain in their
rooms to stop further spread.
The cruise line refunded the money of those who got sick and gave them 25
per cent off on their next cruise. Those who were quarantined received
prorated refunds, Abello said. Even though the number of cases climbed in
each recent trip, Abello said the cruise line expected no more illness
after an "extensive clean up" during the ship's 12-hour layover at Port
Everglades.
The Amsterdam left last night for another Caribbean cruise. "I feel pretty
confident we're able to clean the ship," Abello said. The cruise line sees
no need to quarantine the ship, as was suggested by several passengers.

[The circumstances suggest that the virus implicated in these outbreaks may
have persisted from one cruise to the next despite the decontamination
procedures employed between cruises. There is some precedent for this.
Corwin AL and colleagues (Am J Trop Med Hyg 1999; 61(6): 898-903) have
provided a detailed account of a Norwalk virus outbreak on board a US
aircraft carrier in 1997 attributed to the UK2 genotype of Norwalk virus.
The authors concluded that this outbreak occurred against a background of 3
other consecutive gastroenteritis outbreaks on board the same ship (March
1997, February/March 1998, and June 1998), all sharing the same clinical
and epidemiologic profiles, suggesting possible shipboard persistence of
Norwalk virus over time, despite periodic ship-wide disinfection efforts. -
