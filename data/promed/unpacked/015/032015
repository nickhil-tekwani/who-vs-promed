Four people are dead after an outbreak of group A streptococcal disease (GAS) at a private seniors' residence (RPA) in Montreal's west end. According to Montreal public health officials, there are 6 confirmed cases of infection at Les Résidences Floralies in Lachine.

Officials insist they cannot comment on specifics, but did confirm that the outbreak has already spread to a 2nd seniors' home, Les Résidences Floralies in LaSalle, where at least one case has been detected.

"At this time, Montreal public health is closely monitoring the situation and an epidemiological investigation is underway," said Jean Nicolas Aubé, a spokesperson with the Integrated University Health and Social Services Center of the Centre-Sud-de-l'Île-de-Montréal.

This isn't the 1st time the Résidence Les Floralies has seen a strep A outbreak in its facility. In February 2019, the home in LaSalle was told by Accreditation Canada that it had to create a plan to detect infections and create a pandemic protocol after 3 seniors died due to the disease.

One year later, the private residence was hit hard by COVID-19, with at least 18 residents dying during the 1st wave.

Questions are now being raised about how vigilant monitoring at these facilities is, with the provincial government opening an investigation into the quality of care. The company did not respond to CTV News' request for comment on Wednesday [31 Aug 2022].

According to infectious diseases specialist Dr. Matthew Oughton, the strep A bacteria are easily detectable and can be a common occurrence in healthcare settings. "[It is] relatively easy to treat, but can be aggressive," he said, noting infections can range from minor to life-threatening. "[It is] highly transmissible and can lead to complications and be invasive."

He points to former Quebec premier Lucien Bouchard, who, after being infected with the disease, lost his leg to necrotizing fasciitis, a flesh-eating condition. "When we see an outbreak, we must take steps to screen transmission and decide who needs to be isolated and treated," said Oughton.

Residents in the affected facilities must be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection, including fever, sore throat, pain and change in mental status, adds infectious diseases specialist Dr. Donald Vinh. "If that's the situation for some of the individuals in these residences, immediate medical attention should be sought," he said.

Aubé noted management at the 2 homes are cooperating with health authorities to curb the outbreaks.

[Group A streptococcus (GAS), also called _Streptococcus pyogenes_, are gram-positive cocci that grow in chains. Most often, GAS cause localized superficial infections, such as pharyngitis ("strep throat") or impetigo, which may be complicated by scarlet fever, when strains of GAS produce bacteriophage-encoded erythrogenic exotoxin that is responsible for the skin rash of the infection. These toxin-producing strains cause scarlet fever in people who do not already have antitoxin antibodies. Over a century ago, scarlet fever was feared as a potentially lethal complication of GAS. Its mortality and morbidity waned, however, well before antibiotics became available. Since the advent of antibiotic therapy, the mortality rate of treated scarlet fever has been less than 1%.

Sometimes, GAS invade the lungs (pneumonia), blood (bacteremia), the nervous system (meningitis), cause toxic shock syndrome, or spread along the layers of soft tissue that surround muscle (fasciitis). These infections are called invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) disease and are very serious, even life-threatening, and may account for the high case fatality rate in this Montreal outbreak. However, we are not told what types of GAS infection are involved in this outbreak.

Predisposing factors for iGAS infection include influenza for pneumonia, and skin lesions, poor personal hygiene, crowding in shelters for the homeless, and injection drug use for necrotizing fasciitis. The patients in the Montreal outbreak reportedly are elderly nursing home residents and if bedridden may have had pressure ulcers, also called decubitus ulcers, that could become secondarily infected with GAS.

M protein is the major virulence factor of GAS, which are divided into serotypes based on the antigenic differences in the M protein molecule. More recently, GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the _emm_ gene that encodes M serospecificity (http://medbox.iiab.me/modules/en-cdc/www.cdc.gov/streplab/m-proteingene-typing.html). The news report does not specify the M protein types that are involved in the current outbreak. Other molecular techniques to further characterize outbreak strains include pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of chromosomal DNA fragments, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), detection of exotoxin-encoding genes, and whole genome sequencing. Molecular typing of isolates may aid in documenting whether the Montreal outbreak is caused by a common "outbreak" strain or if multiple different strains are involved.

Les Résidences Floralies in Lachine and LaSalle are assisted living residences for seniors (https://residencesfloralies.qc.ca/en/). Lachine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachine,_Quebec) and LaSalle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaSalle,_Quebec) are adjacent boroughs (arrondissements) within the city of Montreal on the Island of Montreal in southwestern Quebec, Canada. A map showing the location of these boroughs can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lachine,+Montreal,+QC,+Canada.

More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
