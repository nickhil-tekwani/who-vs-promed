---------------------------------------------------------
Begomoviruses are plant viruses that cause major losses to many economically important crops. Although they are poorly understood, begomoviruses infecting wild plants may have an important role as reservoirs in the epidemiology of viral diseases.

This study reports the discovery and genomic characterization of three novel bipartite begomoviruses from wild and cultivated African basil (_Ocimum gratissimum_) plants collected in Uganda, East Africa. Based on the symptoms shown by the infected plants, the names proposed for these viruses are Ocimum yellow vein virus (OcYVV), Ocimum mosaic virus (OcMV), and Ocimum golden mosaic virus (OcGMV).

Genome and phylogenetic analyses suggest that DNA-A of OcGMV is mostly related to begomoviruses infecting tomato [and cassava] in Africa, whereas those of OcYVV and OcMV are closely related to one another and highly divergent within the Old World begomoviruses. The DNA-A of all characterized begomovirus isolates are of a recombinant nature, revealing the role of recombination in the evolution of these begomoviruses.

The viruses characterized here are the first identified in _O. gratissimum_ and the first in _Ocimum_ spp. in the African continent and could have important epidemiological consequences for cultivated basils and other important crops. Understanding the viral diversity in minor crops and wild plants is important because it has epidemiological implications. These plants can act as reservoirs of viruses infecting important crops and even as niches for the development of new strains or species by recombination.

[Begomoviruses are transmitted by different whitefly vectors (such as _Bemisia tabaci_ biotypes). Whiteflies in themselves are serious pests of many vegetable crops. If virus sources are available locally, high vector numbers are often reflected in high levels of the viral diseases they transmit. Many begomoviruses can also be transmitted by mechanical means and grafting, but seed transmission was considered absent for this group. However, recent work has indicated likely seed transmission of _Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_ (TYLCV) in tomato and some other hosts (see links below).

Begomovirus control is particularly difficult in open field crops due to the widespread presence and wide host range of whiteflies. Disease management may include pathogen exclusion, vector control and elimination of possible pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants. In some cases, crop cultivars with increased virus resistance are available.

Frequent recombination events, which may occur even more frequently during coinfections, are considered to be the basis for the diversity within begomoviruses. Variations in host range and specificity may exist both amongst viral species and between different strains within species. New recombinant viruses are often more aggressive and have a widened host range (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20190906.6658287) compared to each of the partners, and so pose an increased risk to the respective crops worldwide.

Further details are provided in the source paper: the phylogenetic analysis showed a recombinant origin for all DNA-A molecules sequenced. Begomoviruses involved included members of the tomato leaf curl and yellow leaf curl clades, as well as the cassava mosaic group. Recombination events in the tomato leaf curl & yellow leaf curl clades have recently given rise to a number of new viruses, for example in the Mediterranean region (see ProMED-mail post 20190906.6658287). Cassava mosaic disease poses a serious threat to the crop and recombinants of viral strains have been reported to be particularly virulent (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20190304.6349348).
