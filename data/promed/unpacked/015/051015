China bird flu victim ate sick chickens
---------------------------------------
HONG KONG: A woman in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong has died
of the H5N1 bird flu virus, which she probably contracted from sick poultry
she kept in her backyard, Hong Kong government health officials said on
Monday [15 Feb 2008]. The 44 year old migrant worker, who was employed in
Haifeng county in the eastern part of Guangdong, tested positive for H5N1
in a test by Guangdong's Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and the
Health Ministry in Beijing has to confirm the result.

"This lady kept some chickens in her backyard and they became sick and died
during the incubation period of her illness. She also ate some of the
chickens herself," said Thomas Tsang, controller of Hong Kong's Centre for
Health Protection. "The most likely route of transmission was from the sick
poultry she kept and she acquired avian influenza from this source." Eating
well-cooked meat is safe but experts have long warned about handling
H5N1-tainted animals or meat without protection.The woman developed
symptoms of fever, cough and pneumonia on 16 Feb 2008, but was only
admitted to the county hospital on February 22, after first seeking
treatment at a local clinic, according to a statement from Guangdong's
health department. "The patient's condition was too serious and she died on
Monday after treatment failed," it said (<http://www.gdwst.gov.cn>).

The latest case follows 2 confirmed deaths from bird flu in China this
year, one in central Hunan province and the other in the southern region of
Guangxi. In December, a man in the eastern province of Jiangsu also died
from the disease. The spate of cases is a concern for a country that has
the world's biggest poultry population, many of them backyard birds roaming
free. China has struggled to combat the virus with mass inoculations for
birds and an education campaign for those who handle them.

There was no sign of further cases of the virus that scientists fear could
mutate into a form that can pass easily between people, sparking a global
pandemic. "All those who have had close contact with the patient have shown
no similar symptoms so far," the statement said. The case in Guangdong has
rattled nerves in Hong Kong, which lies just south of the province. Tsang
said the city would strengthen disease surveillance on both poultry and
people entering Hong Kong. "If a person has signs of pneumonia and has
visited Guangdong in the past 6 months, he will be tested for avian flu,"
he said.

Of the 29 cases confirmed to date in China, 19 have been fatal. According
to WHO data, there have been 232 human deaths globally from the H5N1 strain
and 366 confirmed cases of infection since 2003.

Patient with suspected avian influenza in Shanwei dies
------------------------------------------------------
Guangdong Provincial Health Bureau yesterday morning announced that a 44
year old woman in Haifeng County in Shanwei City, a suspected case of
infection with avian influenza, died at 9:25 am yesterday at Haifeng County
Pengpai Memorial Hospital after the failure of rescue efforts. Moreover,
half a month ago chickens raised by the deceased started falling ill and
dying, and it is suspected she was infected by dead chickens which were
cooked and eaten.

The patient, a woman from Sichuan Province, was a migrant laborer in
Haifeng County of Shanwei City. She became ill on 16 Feb. Clinical
manifestations were fever, cough, pneumonia, etc. She sought treatment at a
local health station[s] and health center[s] with no improvement. On the
morning of February 22 she was transferred to Haifeng County Pengpai
Memorial Hospital and was diagnosed as a "case of pneumonia of unknown
origin" after group consultation by Shanwei City Health Bureau.
Investigations found that the patient had a history of contact with
diseased, dead birds before the onset of illness. Those who had close
contact with the patient and with diseased, dead birds have been placed
under strict medical observation. The Guangdong Center for Disease Control
ran tests on samples from the patient, which were positive for avian
influenza (H5N1). Tests for SARS coronavirus and antibodies were negative.
An expert team from the provincial health bureau diagnosed this as a
suspected case of human infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza in
accordance with the stipulations of the "Emergency Response Plan for Human
Infection with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza"; [the case] was reported
to the Ministry of Health for confirmation.

Sources say that on 24 Feb, the day the provincial health bureau received a
report, it sent 2 groups of experts to Haifeng County to provide emergency
treatment in conjunction with local clinical experts. Because the patient's
conditions was grave, rescue efforts failed and [she] died.

Up to now, none of the patient's close contacts has developed similar
symptoms. The 44 year old mother of 2, who died of suspected avian
influenza, was a native of Nanchong City in Sichuan Province. Sources say
the deceased and her husband leased a brick factory in Haifeng County 5
years ago and invited 22 kinsfolk and home townspeople from 7 families to
jointly run the enterprise. Because they were poor, the 7 families raised
35 chickens next to their residences to help them get by. Half a month ago,
chickens raised by the brick factory workers suddenly became ill. They
became lethargic and started dying. According to a [factory] worker, they
quickly cooked and ate all the chickens. Because [the workers] were
reluctant to throw them away, they even cooked and ate some some chickens
that had just died. A few days later the 44 year old woman suddenly
developed fever and weakness throughout her body. She received treatment at
a local health station, but her condition failed to improve and she was
transferred to Yuedong Hospital and Pengpai Hospital for treatment, and she
died yesterday after treatments failed.

Sources say that, because the parient had been diagnosed with suspected
avian influenza on the 24th of this month, after she was admitted to
Pengpai Hospital, she was placed in the Internal Medicine Department's
Third Patient Ward, which was then isolated. The hospital's medical
personnel and workers all wore protective equipment. A notice was hung in
the hospital's registration lobby providing for priority evaluations of all
febrile patients seeking treatment. Hospital personnel said that an expert
team from Guangdong Health Bureau had arrived for many days, but they were
unwilling to reveal details of the deceased's situation.

On the evening of 24 [Feb] Haifeng County police sealed the brick factory
where the deceased had worked, preventing workers inside from leaving. At
present, 20 people inside the factory are isolated, the youngest is only
one year of age, and the deceased's husband is in isolation at the
hospital. Haifeng County's government has held 2 days of emergency meetings
and ordered all poultry within a 3 km radius of the brick factory culled.
Personnel from epidemic prevention agencies arrived at the brick factory
yesterday to conduct disinfection work.

Egyptian girl tests positive for bird flu
-----------------------------------------
CAIRO: A 4 year old Egyptian girl tested positive for bird flu on Monday
[25 Feb 2008], the 44th confirmed human case in the Arab world's most
populous country, state news agency MENA said. Ministry of Health spokesman
Abdel Rahman Shaheen said the girl had been treated with the antiviral drug
Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and had been transferred from Minya province to a
hospital in Cairo, the agency said. The girl is suffering from a high fever
and is having trouble breathing because she has inflammation of one of her
lungs.

Four Egyptian women died from bird flu in December [2007]. Their deaths
broke a 5 month pause in human cases in Egypt and brought to 19 the number
of Egyptians who have died of the H5N1 bird flu virus since it emerged in
Egypt in early 2006. It is the third winter the virus has struck after
lying low during Egypt's hot summers, when it is much less likely to spread
from one carrier to another.

Around 5 million households in Egypt depend on poultry as a main source of
food and income, and the government has said this makes it unlikely the
disease can be eradicated despite a large-scale poultry vaccination
programme. WHO officials have said the bird flu virus was now considered
endemic in Egypt.

Deaths from bird flu total more than 230 worldwide since 2003 and have been
reported in several African and Asian countries, as well as in Turkey and
Azerbaijan. Egypt has been the hardest-hit country outside of Asia.

HANOI: Vietnam's Health Ministry confirmed that the country's latest human
case of bird flu infection was a 23 year old woman teacher from northern
Phu Tho province who died on 25 Feb 2008 after 5 days of treatment in Hanoi
capital, according to local newspaper Youth on Tuesday [26 Feb 2008]. The
woman from Cam Khe district started to exhibit bird flu symptoms on 14 Feb
and was admitted to a provincial hospital on 19 Feb, then transferred to a
hospital in the city-based Tropical Diseases Hospital on 21 Feb 2008. She
tested positive to bird flu virus strain H5N1, the newspaper quoted Nguyen
Huy Nga, director of the ministry's Preventive Medicine and Environment
Department, as saying. The woman had not had direct contact with sick fowls
before showing bird flu symptoms. Her family raises some chickens. A number
of chickens have died around her house recently.

To date, Viet Nam has confirmed a total of 105 human cases of bird flu
infections, including 51 fatalities, since the disease started to hit the
country in December 2003. WHO has confirmed 104 infection cases, including
50 fatalities, not yet the latest case. In mid-February, 2 local people, a
27 year old man from northern Ninh Binh province and a 41 year old man
named from northern Hai Duong province, died from bird flu. On 18 Jan, a 32
year old ethnic man from northern Tuyen Quang province died from the
disease. Last December, after detecting no human cases of bird flu
infections for nearly 4 months, Viet Nam's Health Ministry confirmed that a
4 year old boy from northern Son La province died on 16 Dec 2007 from bird flu.

Viet Nam currently has seven localities having poultry being hit by bird
flu: Thai Nguyen, Quang Ninh, Hai Duong, Nam Dinh, Tuyen Quang, and Ninh
Binh in the northern region, and southern Long An province, the Department
of Animal Health under the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development said on 25 Feb. Bird flu outbreaks in Viet Nam, starting in
December 2003, have killed and led to the forced culling of dozens of
millions of fowls in the country.

[The current recurrence of sporadic human cases of H5N1 avian influenza in
countries from the Middle East to East Asia where the infection is still
prevalent in domestic poultry may be an inevitable consequence of lower
environmental temperatures, which are thought to favour transmission of the
the virus. In some of these reports human infection is being related to
consumption of diseased poultry. It should be emphasized that it is contact
with diseased poultry that is responsible for transmission of infection,
not the consumption of properly cooked poultry - Mod.CP]
