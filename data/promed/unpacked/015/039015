At a time when all eyes are set on the coronavirus pandemic in Assam, JE (Japanese encephalitis) and AES (acute encephalitis syndrome) have claimed as many as 23 lives in the State since January this year [2020]. While JE claimed 5, AES claimed 18 lives. The district-wise breakdown of the JE and AES toll in the State is 5 in Barpeta district, 3 in Nalbari district, 2 each in Kamrup, Kamrup (M), Udalguri, Sonitpur, Biswanath and Darrang districts, and one each in Dhemaji, Dhubri and Sivasagar districts.

According to sources in the State government, as many as 174 people have been suffering from JE and AES in 27 districts across the State; of them, 38 are JE patients. There are 7 persons -- each in Jorhat and Barpeta districts -- suffering from JE; 3 each in Kamrup (M) and Nagaon districts; 2 in Udalguri district; and one each in Sonitpur, Golaghat, Goalpara districts, etc. Likewise, 136 persons have been suffering from AES, and some of the worst-affected districts are 22 in Dibrugarh; 10 each in Barpeta, Jorhat and Sonitpur; 9 in Dhemaji; 8 in Kamrup (M); 7 in Kamrup; 6 each in Biswanath and Goalpara; 5 each in Udalguri, Sivasagar and Cachar, etc.

The outbreak of both the vector-borne diseases -- JE and AES -- is severe in June, July and August in the State. Around 20%-30% of affected patients lose their lives in Assam annually because of JE and AES. This year [2020], most the deaths were reported in June and July.

[Japanese encephalitis (JE) and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) are again appearing this year (2020) in Assam state. The majority of the cases mentioned above are classified as AES. As mentioned in previous ProMED-mail posts, the issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. AES has continued to be attributed to various etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible Japanese encephalitis, enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, intoxication from lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.

The report above does not indicate whether any of the AES etiologies above have been ruled out or confirmed. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. The season in which AES cases occur is well underway, and additional cases can be expected over the coming 3-4 months.

Although mosquito control is not mentioned in the report above as a JE preventive measure, it is difficult to effectively accomplish in localities where the JE virus vectors, _Culex_ spp., are abundant and widespread. Because the _Culex_ vector mosquitoes also breed in rice paddies, which may be extensive, vector control over large areas is difficult. It is curious that no mention is made of vaccination campaigns in the affected areas. Vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent JE virus infection. - Mod.TY
