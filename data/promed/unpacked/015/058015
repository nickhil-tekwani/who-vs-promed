The Burundi Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)
presented on 8 Jul 2002 a coordinated plan to counter the latest cholera
outbreak, the UN agency reported.
Since the outbreak began on 17 Jun 2002, 2 cholera-related deaths and 101
cases have been recorded in Bujumbura Mairie, the city center. The 8 Jul
2002 presentation to the humanitarian community comes after OCHA convened a
special joint meeting on 5 Jul 2002 involving representatives from the UN,
the government, and the NGO community.
"Coordination and technical follow-up led by OCHA was emphasized and
agreed," Nicholas McGowan, OCHA's information officer, told IRIN.
The number of deaths has so far been limited partly due to the swift
response by Medecins Sans Frontieres-Belgium (MSF-B). However, MSF-B
expressed concern on Friday that the epidemic had continued to spread last
week, up 34 cases from 66. MSF-B and MSF-France, in collaboration with the
International Committee of the Red Cross and Gruppo di Volontariato Civile,
were continuing to provide assistance.
"Clearly, at this stage, the priority of the humanitarian community is to
contain the spread of the disease," McGowan said.
Speaking at the 5 Jul 2002 meeting, Bujumbura Rurale's provincial doctor
announced that an additional 13 cases in Rushubi, and 14 in Nyambuye, had
been identified. Treatment measures will now include immediate distribution
of water purification tablets and the long-term decontamination of the
Nyakabugu river.
In the worst-affected areas of Gihosha and Gikungu, where most of the cases
have been recorded, only one water pump supplies 3500 people. OCHA
announced that it would work with the government water authority, REGIDESO,
to install a temporary water tank this week. Both the local water sources,
the Kingurube and the Nyamivuba creeks, are contaminated. A plan has been
developed that will include their decontamination as soon as the water
level rises and facilitates the necessary work.
The situation in Burundi reflects mounting concern worldwide that unless
urgent action is taken now, by 2020 some 400 million Africans will lack
safe drinking water, and about 600 million will be without hygienic sanitation.
McGowan also said that Burundi was struggling to meet many of the UN's
Millennium Development Goals by 2015. "One of the goals states that by 2015
the number of people without access to safe water should be halved. If
these goals are not met, it will mean that hundreds of thousands of
Burundians will continue to be at risk from serious diseases and infections
such as cholera," he said.

Cholera at Tema - 2 deaths recorded
--------------------------
There is an outbreak of cholera at Tema and its environs, and 42 cases have
been reported within the past month with 2 deaths. Dr Deborah Cubagee,
Tema Municipal Director of Health Services, told the Ghana News Agency that
areas most affected were Ashaiman, Tema Manhean, Teshie, Nungua, Sakomono
and Tema Community 2.
She attributed the outbreak to filthy surroundings and impressed on
the public to observe personal hygiene and environmental cleanliness
"because contracting cholera means one has either eaten or drunk human
excreta." [usually indirectly through fecal contamination of water or food
- Mod.LL]. Dr Cubagee appealed to cooked food sellers in particular to
ensure strict personal hygiene by covering the food soon after serving a
customer while the public should eat their food while it was warm and
constantly wash their hands after any activity.
She said vans with public address systems had started educating the public
about the outbreak while public health nurses were also undertaking
house-to-house visitation to spread the message. She appealed to garbage
collectors to collect on the stipulated days to prevent the spread of the
epidemic and urged the communities to embark on periodic cleaning exercises.
The last time a cholera outbreak was reported in Tema and its environs was
in 1986-87.

Children in Pakistan's southern port city of Karachi are found increasingly
inflicted with cholera and diarrhea during last few days due to a surge in
city temperature, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
As many as 30 percent of all admissions in pediatric wards of local
hospitals are children under the age of 5 suffering from the ailments.
S. Mohammad Afaq of the National Institute of Child Health said that hot
and humid climate particularly favors the bacteria; hence the surge in the
instances of diarrhea and cholera.
"Rain further aggravates their growth and spread, therefore June, July, and
August are particularly known as diarrhea season," he said.
