Sea turtles continue to wash ashore along the Gulf [of Mexico],
forcing the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to scramble and
figure out what is causing the spike. Last week [week of 28 Mar 2011],
the Natural Resources Defense Council and The Huffington Post were
first to publish blogs about the sea turtle deaths in Mississippi.
Since then, the national media picked up the story. Last [Fri 1 Apr
2011], NMFS released a statement with some details about its
investigation:

In the past few weeks, we've seen an increase in turtle strandings in
the northern Gulf, primarily in Mississippi. The spring time is the
typical time when turtle strandings in this region begin to increase,
but the sharp increases in recent days are of concern to us. NOAA
[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] Fisheries is in
contact with the states of Mississippi and Louisiana regarding current
trawl and other fishery activity that can result in turtle by catch
and mortality. In addition, tests will be done for biotoxins, such as
those from harmful algae blooms, which are common in the Gulf. All
causes of death, including petroleum, will be investigated when
possible based on decomposition. During a necropsy, the full GI tract
is examined for product or evidence of oil ingestion. In addition,
samples are taken for PAH [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons] analysis.
All turtles are being carefully examined for signs of external
oiling.

Like the dolphin strandings this year [2011], it's likely that many
more turtles have died and will never be found. A recent study of
dolphin deaths showed the true number of mortalities is probably 50
times what is recovered. As of [Fri 1 Apr 2011], NOAA says recent
deaths of sea turtles, all of which are included on the Endangered
Species list, include 6 in Alabama, 10 in Louisiana, and 47 in
Mississippi.

Make that at least 50 confirmed sea turtle deaths in Mississippi.
This weekend [2-3 Apr 2011], a Pass Christian resident found 3 more
dead turtles. Altogether, she has found 9 this year. Over her more
than 30 years in the community, she has never seen a dead turtle
before.

Nearly 2 weeks ago a new oil spill from a shallow well off the
Louisiana coast leaked oil into the water that resulted in a huge
slick that stretched for miles and polluted parts of Grand Isle and
other nearby marshes. The Coast Guard says it was due to oil leaking
from a well being capped by Anglo-Suisse, an oil drilling firm based
in Texas. Initially the company said it had leaked only 5 gallons of
oil. But the oil slick was clearly much bigger. According to a
Skytruth, an analysis of the slick using satellite imagery shows the
well may have gushed as much as 640 000 gallons of Louisiana crude
into the sea. It's not clear what impact this oil spill has had on
marine life.

In Mississippi, [the Pass Christian resident] believes BP oil has
something to do with the dead sea life she constantly encounters by
the shore. And she wonders how this may affect vacationers now
flocking to the region. "It's bad enough for turtles and dolphins to
be dying, but should people and their children be swimming in this
water too?" That is not the kind of message BP or local politicians
want to hear.

[There is something affecting the turtles but it is not necessarily
issues that may relate to the BP oil spill. A necropsy on the turtles
is needed and clearly that means finding one that is not too badly
decomposed. If the turtles are dying out in the water and then washing
ashore, it becomes more problematic. Without some testing it is
impossible to state the cause of the turtles' demise. - Mod.TG
