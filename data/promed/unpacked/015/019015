Redland City councillor Wendy Boglary is warning residents to clear up stagnant water in gardens to keep mosquito-borne diseases at bay. Mosquito prevention costs Redland City Council AUD 748 000 [USD 776 500] a year.

Redland City Council is urging residents to clean up their back yards in a bid to crack down on mosquitoes and curb the spread of disease after a rise in cases of Barmah Forest virus.

Council Community and Environmental Health portfolio chairman Cr Wendy Boglary issued the warning after Queensland Health statistics showed a spike in the reported cases of Barmah Forest in Metro South Health district since 1 Jan [2013], compared with the same quarter last year. Compared to 94 cases in all of 2012, 41 cases of the mosquito-borne disease were recorded in the district since January [2013].

In Redland, from July 2012 to March 2013, Queensland Health recorded 19 cases of Barmah Forest, a 16 per cent increase in cases over the last 9 months. Council, which keeps records of all notifiable diseases, said the increase in Redland was "not significant" and coincided with a 35 per cent decrease in overall mosquito-transmitted diseases in the financial year to March 2013. It also said there was no evidence that people with the disease were infected within Redland city limits.

The council clean-up warning came a week after an outbreak of the incurable mosquito-borne virus was recorded on the Gold Coast, where 22 people were infected since mid-March 2013, a rate of almost one person a day.

Symptoms of the virus include fever, rash, joint pain, swelling, headaches and feeling tired. The rise in Barmah Forest virus [infections], named after the northern Victoria town, coincided with high rainfall over summer. Since January [2013], more than 702 mm of rain has been recorded in the Brisbane area, compared with the median rainfall for those 3 months of 397 mm. Point Lookout recorded 763 mm since January 2013.

Metro South Public Health senior medical officer Dr Brad McCall warned residents to avoid mossie-prone areas, use insect repellent and cover up to avoid bites. He said protection against mosquito bites would safeguard against the transfer of mosquito-borne viruses such as Ross River and Barmah Forest. "It is worth noting that the increase in Barmah Forest virus in Metro South is from a low base and that rates of infection in Metro South are still amongst the lowest in the state."

Cr Boglary said council had held 6 aerial spraying treatments this financial year [2013] and was vigilant in its control of mosquitoes and was aware of the threat of diseases being spread. "Residents also play an important role and should check they have no containers lying around yards collecting stagnant water," Cr Boglary said.

[Periods of higher than usual rainfall often bring an increase in mosquito populations, with corresponding increases in transmission of endemic arthropod-borne viruses in those areas. The same situation occurred in 2011 in different localities in Australia. Although not as serious a human health threat as Ross River virus infections, the morbidity rate can be significant, and the disease can be incapacitating.
