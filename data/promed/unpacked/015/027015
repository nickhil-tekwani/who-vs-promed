[The following information was included in posting 20060331.0970 of
31 Mar 2006: "Bird flu has been found in ducks on 2 family farms in
southwestern Cambodia, a little more than a week after a toddler died
from the H5N1 virus in the country, officials say. Though no new
human infections have been found, the latest outbreak marks the 4th
time in 2 months the virus has struck in Cambodia after a year
without any reported cases".
Indeed Cambodia's last report to the OIE was sent a year ago, namely
on 1 Apr 2005 (see
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/aIS_77.htm#Sec2>). No "final
report", declaring the outbreak in Cambodia ended, could be found on
OIE's web-site.
Kampong Spoe and Kampot (southern Cambodia), can be seen in the map
