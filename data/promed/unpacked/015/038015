FDA Approves New Vaccine to Prevent Japanese Encephalitis
---------------------------------------------------------
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today approved IXIARO, a
vaccine to prevent Japanese encephalitis (JE), which is caused by a
mosquito-transmitted virus found mainly in Asia. IXIARO will be the
only vaccine for JE available in the United States. "This vaccine
offers protection for individuals who travel to or live in areas
where outbreaks are known to occur," said Karen Midthun, M.D., acting
director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.
In Asia, JE affects about 30 000 to 50 000 people each year,
resulting in 10 000 to 15 000 deaths. JE is rarely seen in the United
States, with very few cases reported among civilians and military
who have been to Asia.

The virus that causes JE affects membranes around the brain, and mild
infections can occur without apparent symptoms other than fever and
headache. In people who develop severe disease, JE usually starts as a
flu-like illness but can worsen, causing high fever, neck stiffness,
brain damage, coma, or even death. The disease is transmitted from
wild birds and pigs via infected mosquitoes; it is not spread from
human to human.

IXIARO is a 2nd-generation JE vaccine that is manufactured
using cell culture technology, leading to improved manufacturing
efficiency as well as more reliable control of the vaccine
manufacturing process. This technology utilizes an established bank
of cells that can be drawn from at any time contributing to the
assurance of consistent vaccine quality. It also enhances the ability
to rapidly manufacture a vaccine on a large scale if needed, without
compromising the vaccine's safety or effectiveness.

Clinical studies were conducted in more than 800 healthy men and women
in the USA and Europe. Participants received either IXIARO or JE-VAX,
another U.S.-licensed vaccine that is no longer being manufactured.
The studies found that IXIARO produced sufficient levels of antibodies
in the blood to protect against JE. IXIARO requires only 2 doses
instead of JE-VAX's 3.

The vaccine was well tolerated and the most commonly reported adverse
events were headache, muscle pain and pain, swelling, and tenderness
at the injection site. Overall, it was more tolerable and had fewer
side effects than the comparator, JE-VAX.

[There are currently a number of vaccines in use locally in Asia and
elsewhere for the protection of travellers. Not all of these vaccines
are licensed. For example there are 2 vaccines available for use in
the UK -- JE-VAX and 'Green Cross.' Both are currently unlicensed,
and have similar schedules for rapid and normal vaccination. These
vaccines contain formalin-inactivated Nakayama strain virus derived
from mouse brains. They contain small amounts of thiomersal. They are
inactivated, do not contain live organisms, and thus cannot cause the
disease against which they protect.

The IXIARO vaccine would appear to have certain advantages over these
inactivated virus vaccines, but may be more costly. - Mod.CP]
