Farmers, especially in southern and southwestern North Dakota, should be on the watch for an infectious disease usually associated with deer.

Dr. Susan Keller, North Dakota state veterinarian, urged producers to contact their veterinarians if their livestock display signs of epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD), including excessive salivation, swollen tongue, lameness or stiffness when walking, ulcers in the mouth and gums, fever, and reproductive problems. Keller said cases have been reported in cattle in several North Dakota counties.

"The clinical signs are similar to those of bovine viral diarrhea, bluetongue, and foot and mouth disease," Keller said. "Producers who detect these symptoms should report them immediately, so foreign animal disease can be ruled out."

"EHD has been identified in deer south and west of the Missouri River," said Dr. Dan Grove, wildlife veterinarian with the North Dakota Game and Fish Department. "Areas along the Cannonball and Heart Rivers in Sioux and Grant counties seem to be most impacted by EHD."

Grove said the disease has also been found in deer in Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming this year [2013].

"It is important for producers to work with their veterinarians to determine the cause of illness or death," said North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring.

Keller said infected cattle usually recover from EHD, which poses no threat to human health.

A viral disease, EHD primarily attacks wild ruminants, such as deer, bighorn sheep, and antelope, but can also affect domestic animals, cattle, sheep and goats. It is spread by midges, tiny biting flies of the genus _Culocoides_ and is not spread from animal to animal.

Although EHD is often fatal to deer, its effect on cattle is usually much less severe. Closely related, but different than bluetongue, EHD exists in several strains. The North Dakota State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and the National Veterinary Service Laboratory confirmed EHD2 in the affected North Dakota cattle.

[EHD or epizootic hemorrhagic disease is most commonly found in cervids. However, several cases have occurred finding EHD or EHD2 in cattle.

The epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses belong to the genus _Orbivirus_, family Reoviridae. Ten serotypes of EHDV are known worldwide. The viruses of the EHDV serogroup are transmitted by biological vectors, usually biting midges in the genus _Culicoides_. In North America, _C. variipennis_ is the major vector. Some species of gnats and mosquitoes can also transmit EHDV. Infected deer can be viremic for up to 2 months. The incubation period for epizootic hemorrhagic disease in deer is 5 to 10 days.

Disease in cattle is characterized by fever, anorexia, and difficulty swallowing. The swallowing disorders are caused by damage to the striated muscles of the pharynx, larynx, esophagus and tongue, and may lead to dehydration, emaciation, and aspiration pneumonia. Edema, hemorrhages, erosions, and ulcerations may be seen in the mouth, on the lips, and around the coronets. The animals may be stiff and lame, and the skin may be thickened and edematous. Abortions and stillbirths have also been reported in some epidemics. Most EHDV infections in cattle appear to be subclinical.

Typical symptoms include fever, oral ulcers, salivation, lameness associated with coronitis, and weight loss. In pregnant cows, the fetus may be resorbed or develop hydranencephaly if it is infected between 70 and 120 days of gestation. Deaths are uncommon with the North American strains of EHDV; however, some animals may be lame and unthrifty for a prolonged period. Epizootic hemorrhagic disease has not been reproduced in experimentally infected cattle; although animals become viremic, they remain asymptomatic.

Preferred tissues in deer are spleen, lymph node, and unclotted whole blood in EDTA or heparin. Other useful samples may include serum (for serology), liver, and lung. Both fresh and fixed tissues should be collected if possible. Samples for virus isolation should be transported under refrigeration. For suspect cases in cattle, blood should be collected into anticoagulant (calcium citrate, EDTA, or heparin) and sent chilled for virus isolation or RT-PCR. Paired serum samples should also be collected if possible. Additionally, because of other differentials, involved fluid from intact vesicles as well as aggressive swabs or biopsy samples near lesions are also suggested.

Should questions arise, please feel free to contact any of the diagnosticians at the ISU-VDL (515-294-1950).
