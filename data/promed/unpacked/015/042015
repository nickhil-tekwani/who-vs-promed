Eugene Nepoklonov, Deputy Head of Rosselkhoznadzor and chief veterinary inspector of Russia, noted [during talks with the CVO of the UK, Nigel Gibben] that the distribution of bluetongue in the EU remains an acute problem.

His particular concern was the detection in Belarus of animals suspected as infected with BTV-8 as well as with the exotic BTV-14. The latter, he said, were suspected to have been imported from Poland and the Baltic States.

Besides this, Rosselkhoznadzor had information on a sick calf in Spain, suspected to be infected by the same BTV-14. Nepoklonov underlined the need for updated information on bluetongue in Europe and expressed particular concern on the widening presence of bluetongue in northern Europe. Previously, that region was regarded as free of the disease due to its climatic conditions, unsuitable for the BTV insect vectors.

[According to a press report of the Russian news agency Interfax dated Fri 23 Nov 2012, the head of Rosselkhoznadzor, Sergei Dankvert, has expressed concerns on suspected BTV-14 presence in "a number of European countries, particularly Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia." Firsthand information was requested.

While according to ProMED-mail's policy, criticisms of governments/countries are preferably excluded, the concerns officially raised and published by the Russian authorities deserve to be addressed, confirmed or otherwise.

BTV serotype 14 has, according to the reference laboratory at Pirbright, been previously isolated from ruminants in South Africa, USA, Belize, and Cameroon. Subscribers are referred to the webpage "Isolates of Bluetongue virus type 14 (BTV-14) in the dsRNA virus collection at IAH Pirbright", at http://www.reoviridae.org/dsRNA_virus_proteins/ReoID/btv-14.htm.

Russia's own bluetongue situation deserves some elucidation as well.

Bluetongue (an officially notifiable disease) has been reported by Russia as absent between 1994 and (including) 2007, and reoccurring in 2008. In Russia's 2008 annual report to the OIE, bluetongue was reported to be present in cattle, in the following provinces (number of outbreaks in brackets): Belgorodskaya oblast (1), Kaluzhskaya oblast (2), Kurskaya oblast (1), Lipetskaya oblast (2), Stavropopl'skiy kray (1), Yaroslavskaya oblast (3); total 10 outbreaks in 6 administrative territories. No serotyping provided.

According to the annual report for 2009, the disease was recorded in 3 oblasts: Kaluzhskaya (3 outbreaks), Nizhegodskaya (1), and Kaliningradskaya (1). No serotyping given.

In 2010, the disease was reported in cattle in the Kaluzhskaya oblast (1 outbreak); no serotyping.

In the last annual report, 2011, bluetongue was reported during the 1st semester from the Kaluzhskaya oblast (cattle, unspecified number of outbreaks, no serotyping). During the 2nd semester, BTV, serotyped 14, was reported from 4 provinces: Kaluzhskaya oblast (1), Krasnoyarskiy kray (number of outbreaks unspecified), Nizhegorodskaya oblast (number outbreaks unspecified), and Izhegorodskaya oblast (1). An immediate notification on the diagnosis of sub-clinical bluetongue, serotype 14, was submitted to the OIE on 30 Dec 2011; a follow-up report No. 1 was submitted on 14 Mar 2012; the epizootic is currently "continuing."

No immediate notification was sent to the OIE in 2008, when the disease recurred in Russia after its apparent absence since 1994, and no data on clinical manifestations, if at all, have been included in the annual/semiannual reports until 2011. The disease has not been reported in sheep.

A serological survey of livestock was undertaken in Kazakhstan in 1997-1998, involving 958 animals (cattle, sheep, and goats). It showed an overall seroprevalence for BT virus of 23 percent (cattle 25.4, sheep 21.4, and goats 25.5 percent). Seropositive animals were found to be widespread, suggesting endemicity. Few animals were found seropositive for another orbivirus, namely EHDV (epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus), namely 8 cattle (2.9 percent) and 2 sheep (0.4 percent). (Ref 1).

The All-Russian Scientific-Research Institute for Veterinary Virology and Microbiology, Pokrov, was engaged also in the 1st identification of bluetongue in Russia in 1994 (Vishnyakov et al, cited in Ref 1).

Have sero-surveys in large and small ruminants been conducted in Russian territories since 2000? Is there information on clinical disease in sheep, the species known to be most susceptible to BTV?

Information from other European countries, in response to Russia's Rosselkhoznadzor suspicions re BTV-14, is anticipated.
