[African swine fever [ASF] in wild boars took Belgium (Luxembourg province) by surprise in September 2018; the disease had not been circulating in any neighboring county. The number of cases peaked in February 2019, with the last case in a killed animal reported in August 2019.

Introduction of ASF into eastern Germany was feared since the start, on 4 Nov 2019, of a new, extensive outbreak in western Poland. The German event is assumed to have started some time (weeks?) before the 1st infected animal was found (9 Sep 2020). Hopefully, adequate application of the prepared control/eradication measures, including the effective performance of local authorities, hunters, and pig farmers, will lead to the outbreak remaining limited to the core zone. Belgium's core zone had to be extended several times. - Mod.AS
