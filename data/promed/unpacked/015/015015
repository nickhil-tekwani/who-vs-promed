The hepatitis A outbreak that hit southern Estonia this autumn [2011]
continues to find new victims; 8 new cases were registered in the
country last week, bringing the total number of those infected since
the beginning of the year to 80.

In Viljandi county, the epicenter of the outbreak, 59 cases had been
registered as of Mon 10 Oct 2011, according to Delfi [News agency for
the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania], citing data from
the Health Board.

While health authorities have not pinpointed the origin of the
infection, the Veterinary and Food Board said that it was unrelated to
food, food preparation or drinking water. Doctors say that the disease
is now being transmitted primarily person-to-person, through contact
with those infected.

Hepatitis A virus is a virus that affects the liver, causing
inflammation of the organ and often jaundice (yellowing of skin). It
can be spread as the result of poor hygiene, contaminated food and
contact with an infected person.

The 1st case in Viljandi was confirmed [in February 2011], but since
25 Aug 2011, the infection numbers have spiked dramatically. Prior to
this year [2011], incidents of hepatitis A in Estonia had remained
relatively rare, with most cases found among recent immigrants.

[As predicted by Professor Noah in the previous post in this thread
(Hepatitis A - Estonia (03): (VD) comment 20110915.2809), transmission
of hepatitis A virus infection in this outbreak is now predominantly
by person-to-person contact, making it unlikely that any contaminated
food or water source, if there was such, will be identified.

Viljandi is a town and municipality in southern central Estonia. It is
the capital of Viljandi county. Its location can be seen in the map
