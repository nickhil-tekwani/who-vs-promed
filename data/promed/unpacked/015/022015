A cook at Kelly's Roast Beef in Saugus, Massachusetts is sick with _Salmonella_ Typhi, a bacteria which causes typhoid fever. The restaurant confirmed the information Tue 21 May 2019. The illness is rare in the United States, but more common in some developing nations. Kelly's says the employee had just returned from out of the country.

"We were coming to have clams, roast beef, the usual," said a customer, one of the many regulars showing up unaware that the restaurant temporarily closed down.

Kelly's says it is allowed to be open, but they don't have enough available staff because everyone needs to be tested before coming back to work. Only the Saugus location is impacted.

Typhoid fever can be life-threatening, and only affects about 350 people in the USA every year according to the CDC.

People who are infected with the microbe can spread the bacteria to others. "When I hear of this I don't come back to the restaurant at all," said another customer. "I stop coming, I won't be back."

Kelly's management says they're not sure when they can reopen. About a hundred employees need to be tested.

[The food service worker had just returned from abroad and appears to have acquired the typhoid bacillus infection during the trip. Pretravel counseling including appropriate immunizations could have prevented this infection. Foodborne secondary cases related to the restaurant may occur. Vaccine intervention is an important step, as increasing antimicrobial resistance in the typhoid bacillus in Asia has made treatment more difficult.

Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation from that of the more common kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive.

The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever; anorexia; lethargy; malaise; dull, continuous headache; nonproductive cough; vague abdominal pain; and constipation. Despite the (often high) fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly (both liver and spleen enlarged). After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions ("rose spots") are about 2 cm (0.78 inch) in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common.

The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus. - Mod.LL
