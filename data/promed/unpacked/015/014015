Date submitted to OIE: 26 Oct 2011
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 1 Sep 2011
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Foot and mouth disease virus
Serotype: O

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1: TARSHIHA, Acco, HAZAFON
Date of start of the outbreak: 15 Oct 2011
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)

Epidemiological unit: Village
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 40 / 15 / 2 / 0 / 0

Affected Population: The herd contains free-ranging beef cows and one
bull. At the start of the outbreak, clinical signs were seen only in
the mouth, with vesicles on the lips and the tongue. On 26 Oct 2011,
lesions were seen also on the muzzle, and limping also has been
observed. The cows were vaccinated in May 2011 and received a booster
vaccine on 20 Oct 2011.

Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak statistics
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent
case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 37.50 percent / 5.00 percent / 13.33 percent / 5.00 percent

* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction
and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Introduction of new
live animals

Epidemiological comments: In the investigation, it was revealed that
one week before the outbreak, 3 cows from a village near the Lebanese
border were introduced into the herd. The epidemiological
investigation is ongoing.

Control measures:
Measures applied: Quarantine; Movement control inside the country;
Zoning
Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s):
Administrative division: HAZAFON
Species: cattle; Total Vaccinated: 200
Species: goats; Total vaccinated: 400

Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type: FMD Laboratory, Kimron Veterinary Institute
(National laboratory)
Tests and results:
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 25 Oct 2011 / Positive
Cattle / virus isolation / 25 Oct 2011 / Positive

[FMD has a seasonal pattern in Israel, peaking in April-May. Outbreaks
in October are somewhat rare (October outbreaks were 4 percent of the
total annual during the years 1967-1982; no outbreak in October since
1985). The background to the seasonality has not been clarified,
though several hypotheses have been discussed, including the potential
role of wild boars. Multi-annual observation shows that about 70
percent of primary outbreaks of FMD in Israel are seen in areas
adjacent to the northern frontiers, bordering Lebanon, Syria and
north-west Jordan. The current outbreak is adjacent to the Lebanese
border; see map at the source URL.

The relatively high (37.50 percent) "apparent morbidity rate" in the
affected herd, in spite of its reported vaccination in May 2011, is in
need of clarification. Previous vaccination history, age distribution
of the affected (and unaffected) animals, and genotyping results of
the FMDV involved will help. The FMDV-O strains included in the
vaccine currently used in Israel are Manisa 67, Geshur 85 and Turkey
3039. Are they the right, relevant ones to protect against the
circulating strain(s)?

In view of the scarcity of epidemiological data from most
Middle-Eastern countries, it seems that Israel's livestock have become
Europe's sentinel for FMD (and other epizootics...) in the region. The
collected information on the current outbreak, in particular
addressing vaccine efficacy, is of importance regionally and beyond. -
