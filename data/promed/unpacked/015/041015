About 21 percent of international travelers -- and 37 percent of travelers with diarrhea who had taken antibiotics -- may be colonized with drug-resistant bacteria, according to a study yesterday [21 Jan 2015] in Clinical Infectious Diseases [1].

Researchers collected stool samples from 430 Finns before and after they traveled outside of Scandinavia. They tested for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), 2 drug-resistant "superbugs."

They found that 90 of the travelers, or 21 percent, became colonized by ESBL-PE after traveling, but none by CPE. For travelers to South Asia, the prevalence rose to 46 percent.

The rate of ESBL-PE was 11 percent in those without traveler's diarrhea (TD) or antimicrobial use, 21 percent for those with TD and no antimicrobial use, and 37 percent in those with both TD and antimicrobial use.

Those numbers climbed to 14, 37, and 69 percent, respectively, in travelers to Southeast Asia, and to 23 percent, 47 percent, and 80 percent in travelers to South Asia.

"More than 300 million people visit these high-risk regions every year," said lead author Anu Kantele, MD, PhD, according to a press release from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), which publishes the journal. "If approximately 20 percent of them are colonized with the bugs, these are really huge numbers. This is a serious thing. The only positive thing is that the colonization is usually transient, lasting for around half a year."

An accompanying editorial called the paper "an excellent prospective study that provides very compelling evidence that antimicrobials increase a traveler's risk of colonization by ESBL-PE [2]."

The authors conclude, "In modern pre-travel counseling for those visiting high-risk regions, travelers should be advised against taking antibiotics for mild or moderate TD [2]."

[The above news report refers to a study and an accompanying commentary recently published online in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases (Kantele A, Laaveri T, Mero S, et al. Antimicrobials Increase Travelers' Risk of Colonization by Extended-Spectrum Beta lactamase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae. Clin Infect Dis. (2015) doi: 10.1093/cid/ciu957. 1st published online: 21 Jan 2015. Available at: http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/01/07/cid.ciu957.full.pdf+html). The study's abstract is reproduced below:

"Abstract
---------
Background. More than 300 million travelers visit regions with poor hygiene annually. A significant percentage of them become colonized by resistant intestinal bacteria such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) and may transmit the strains to others and to medical care settings when they return home. Despite the threats to global healthcare caused by an upsurge in antimicrobial resistance, no effort has been centered on prevention of colonization while traveling.

Methods. Stool samples were collected from 430 Finns before and after traveling outside Scandinavia. All specimens were analyzed for ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). Questionnaires were used to survey volunteers about use of antimicrobials as well as other potential risk factors. The results were subjected to multivariable analysis.

Results. 21 percent (90/430) of the travelers became colonized by ESBL-PE and none by CPE. Geographic region, occurrence of travelers' diarrhea (TD), age, and use of antimicrobial (AB) for TD were identified as independent risk factors predisposing to contracting ESBL-PE. 11 percent of those in subgroup TD-AB-, 21 percent in TD+AB-, and 37 percent in TD+AB+ acquired ESBL-PE. The risk proved to be highest in South Asia (46 percent); 23 percent became colonized in subgroup TD-AB-, 47 percent in TD+AB-, and 80 percent in TD+AB+. In Southeast Asia, the rates were 14 percent, 37 percent, and 69 percent, respectively.

Conclusions. TD and antimicrobials for TD proved to be independent risk factors, with up to 80 percent of TD+AB+ travelers contracting ESBL-PE. In modern pre-travel counseling for those visiting high-risk regions, travelers should be advised against taking antibiotics for mild or moderate TD."

The authors of this study note, "Even in low-prevalence countries, infection control in healthcare settings mainly focuses on patients hospitalized while abroad. The present data suggest that measures should also embrace those with other significant risk factors such as a history of TD and use of antimicrobials when visiting high risk areas."
