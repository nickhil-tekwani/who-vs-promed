First zoonotic babesiosis in Tennessee and new ehrlichiosis species in
Minnesota and Wisconsin
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Among new tick-related infectious disease findings presented at the
International Conference on Emerging Infectious Disease (ICEID), which
ended 14 Jul 2010 in Atlanta, were a report on the 1st zoonotic
babesiosis case documented in Tennessee and a report on ehrlichiosis
infections in Minnesota and Wisconsin involving a species that had not
previously been identified in North America
[<http://www.iceid.org/images/stories/newsroom/wednesday_abstracts.pdf>].

In the 1st report, a group from the Tennessee Department of Health,
Vanderbilt University, and the CDC diagnosed babesiosis in an
immunosuppressed patient who began to have fever, fatigue, and
headache. He had not traveled outside Tennessee in several years and
had been exposed to ticks during hunting trips.

_Babesia_ parasites were noted on the man's blood smear and molecular
analysis revealed that it was a novel species, but attempts to isolate
it were unsuccessful. The man's symptoms resolved after 10 days of
treatment.

The researchers said efforts to identify the animal host and tick
vectors are ongoing and that the case serves as a reminder that
patients can have babesiosis without exposure to known endemic areas
and without testing positive to previously known species.

In the 2nd report, local health officials and CDC and Mayo Clinic
experts described the identification of _Ehrlichia_ DNA from Mayo
Clinic blood samples of patients from the 2 states involving a species
similar to _E. muris_ that had not been previously identified in North
America [see first ProMED ref. below].

The organism was found in 2009 in the blood of 4 patients, 3 from
Wisconsin, and 1 from Minnesota. All had reported fever and headache,
and all had lymphopenia. All recovered with doxycycline treatment.
Serological studies also suggested 40 more probable cases among
Wisconsin residents. A survey of the patients found dog contact in 91
percent and possible tick exposure in 85 percent. The group concluded
that more studies are needed to identify the epidemiologic and
clinical features of infections with the _E. muris_-like organism and
that better testing in the region could help identify the infections.

[A history of tick bites cannot be used to assess risk of infections
transmitted by ticks -- the bites can easily pass unnoticed. The
report underlines that protozoan infections in ticks such as _Babesia_
and _Ehrlichia_ and probably also rickettsial organisms remain
underdiagnosed and are likely to appear in new areas. Immunosuppressed
patients are especially vulnerable as illustrated in this report. -
Mod.EP]

[Ehrlichiosis [is caused by] a group of tick-borne zoonotic diseases
that are due to rickettsia-like obligate intracellular bacteria and
are usually named according to the host species and the type of white
blood cell most often infected. In 2001, when the taxonomy of the
ehrlichiae was changed, the name of _Ehrlichia phagocytophila_ was
changed to _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ and the name of the disease it
caused was changed from human granulocytic ehrlichiosis to human
granulocytic anaplasmosis
(<http://riki-lb1.vet.ohio-state.edu/ehrlichia/background/ehrlichiaspp.php>).

The name for human monocytic or monocytotropic ehrlichiosis and its
pathogen, _Ehrlichia chaffeensis_ remain unchanged. _Ehrlichia muris_
has been found in rodents in Japan (Wen B, et al. _Ehrlichia muris_ p.
nov. Identified on the Basis of 16s rRNA Base Sequences and
Serological, Morphological, and Biological Characteristics. Internat J
Syst Bacteriol 1998; 45: 250-254). Although not previously known to be
associated with any human disease, it can cause murine
monocytotropic ehrlichiosis.- Mod.ML]
