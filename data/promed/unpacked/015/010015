UNDIAGNOSED ULCERS, FISH - ISRAEL (02)

"Tilapia tolerate adverse water quality and other stressors better than most
other commercial aquaculture species. Because stress and environmental
quality play such important roles in the disease process, tilapia are
labeled as being very disease-resistant. This basically means that in the
presence of pathogens, tilapia are the last to break with disease. As a
result, tilapia growers worldwide did not historically practice clean
culture methods. Moreover, they did not generally implement the biosecurity
measures that had become standard in industries that grew less
disease-resistant fish such as trout and salmon. In other words, there was
no apparent penalty for being careless -- or so it seemed."
