Low-risk H5N1 bird flu found in Pennsylvania ducks
-----------------------------------------------
Mallard ducks in Pennsylvania have tested positive for a
low-pathogenic strain of the H5N1 bird flu virus, the U.S.
Agriculture and Interior departments said on Saturday [2 Sep 2006],
adding to cases detected recently in Maryland and Michigan.
A strain of the H5N1 avian influenza virus was found in wild ducks
sampled 28 Aug 2006 in Crawford County in northwestern Pennsylvania.
"Testing has ruled out the possibility of this being the highly
pathogenic H5N1 strain that has spread through birds in Asia, Europe
and Africa," USDA and Interior said in a statement.
"Test results thus far indicate this is low pathogenic avian
influenza, which poses no risk to human health."
The government said it was conducting additional tests to determine,
in part, whether the ducks had H5N1 or 2 separate strains with one
virus contributing H5 and the other N1. A 2nd round of tests could
take 5 to 10 more days to confirm whether it was low-pathogenic H5N1
bird flu.
The virus also has been found during the last month [August 2006] in
Michigan and on Friday [1 Sep 2006] in Maryland. The Maryland
mallards did not appear sick, so the samples, collected on 2 Aug 2006
as part of a research project, were not given high priority when sent
to USDA labs for testing.
The U.S. departments of Agriculture and Interior are working with
states to collect between 75 000 and 100 000 wild bird samples in
addition to more than 50 000 environmental tests throughout the
United States.
A low-pathogenic strain, which produces less disease and mortality in
birds than does a high-pathogenic version, poses no threat to humans.
It is common for mild and low pathogenic strains of bird flu to
appear in the United States and other countries.
The latest H5N1 bird flu strain in Asia, Europe and Africa is known
to have killed at least 141 people and forced hundreds of millions of
birds to be destroyed.

[Low pathogenic strains of avian influenza often circulate in wild
birds without any mutation to highly pathogenic, and without passing
to commercial flocks. This clearly shows that US surveillance for all
forms of avian influenza is working.
It is indeed sad that often lawmakers see the term avian influenza
without realizing the science or the risk behind the disease. The AI
found in the wild mallard ducks in Maryland and now Pennsylvania, and
in the mute swan in Michigan, are very unlikely to become highly
pathogenic varieties or be passed to the commercial flocks.
Nevertheless, there are countries which have reacted with various
bans. Some have banned all poultry originating in the US and some
have only banned poultry and products from those affected states.
Certainly, this is a reactionary measure that they believe will
protect their country. - Mod.TG]
