With a new report issued by World Health Organization (WHO) revealing that 17 per cent of communicable diseases worldwide are borne by vectors, a top official in Oman has pointed to a rise in the number of people hit by one such disease in the country -- malaria.

Reacting to the WHO report, Dr Majed S al Zedjali, director, Department of Malaria Eradication, and disease surveillance coordinator at the Ministry of Health (MoH), highlighted a worrying rise in the number of malaria cases in Oman. "Cases of malaria in the country have risen from 898 in 2009 to 2051 in 2012," he told Muscat Daily. The last annual report of MoH (2012) that was released recently says that control over malaria transmission had been achieved in 2004 and maintained till September 2007 when focus of local transmission (territory from where it was being transmitted) was detected in Dakhliyah [governorate].

In 2008, another territory was detected in North Batinah. In 2009, no local transmission occurred, but 3 territories were detected in North Sharqiyah the next year [2010] with a total of 24 cases. In 2011, there were 13 cases of local transmission in North Sharqiyah and Dakhliyah, 22 the next year [2012] in South and North Sharqiyah and North Batinah.

Of the total of 2051 cases recorded in Oman in 2012, the majority (98.9 per cent) were imported except 22, which were locally transmitted, the MoH report stated.

[Dakhliyah governorate is in the eastern part of Oman south west of the capital Muscat, and North Batinah and North Sharqiyah governorates are north of Muscat on the cost of the Gulf of Oman.

The WHO report mentioned in the news article, "A global brief on vector-borne diseases", can be retrieved at http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/111008/1/WHO_DCO_WHD_2014.1_eng.pdf.

The article does not say whether the type of malaria is _Plasmodium falciparum_ or _Plasmodium vivax_. If the malaria is _P. vivax_, it needs to be genotyped to determine whether it is the tropical or temperate (long incubation time) variant (see: Petersen E, et al. _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria: a re-emerging threat for temperate climate zones? Travel Med Infect Dis. 2013;11:51-9).

If the patients have no travel history, as stated here, there must be a reservoir of infection in Oman. The situation could be similar to the situation in Greece, where immigrant workers started a limited local transmission of _P. vivax_ in 2011 and 2012. Active case detection in both Omani and immigrants in the areas with local transmission is needed, as well as entomological studies of the local anopheles mosquitoes.
