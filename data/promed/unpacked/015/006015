[1] USA: CDC report
Date: Sat 5 Mar 2011
Source: CDC, _E. coli_ Outbreak Investigations [edited]
<http://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2011/hazelnuts0157/index.html>


The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is
collaborating with public health officials in California, Michigan,
Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the Food and Drug Administration to
investigate a multistate outbreak of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7
infections. Investigators are using DNA analysis of _E. coli_ O157:H7
bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing to identify cases of
illness that may be part of this outbreak.

As of 4 Mar 2011, 7 people infected with the outbreak strain of _E.
coli_ serotype O157:H7 have been reported from Michigan (1 case),
Minnesota (3 cases), and Wisconsin (3 cases). Reported dates of
illness onset range from 20 Dec 2010 to 28 Jan 2011. Those affected
range in age from 15 to 78 years, with a median age of 62 years; 86
per cent are male. 43 per cent of those ill reported being
hospitalized, and none has reported hemolytic uremic syndrome. No
deaths have been reported.

Collaborative investigative efforts of local, state, and federal
public health and regulatory agencies have associated this outbreak
with eating in-shell hazelnuts (also known as filberts). Most of the
in-shell hazelnuts were purchased from bulk bins at retail food
stores. Source tracing has identified a common distributor for the
hazelnuts consumed by ill persons: DeFranco & Sons in Los Angeles,
California.

DeFranco & Sons of Los Angeles, California is voluntarily recalling
bulk and consumer-packaged in-shell hazelnuts and mixed-nut products
containing hazelnuts. These nuts may have been sold by retailers
nationwide. The in-shell nuts may have been sold in 2-pound [about 1
kg] and 4-pound packages of mixed nuts, 1-pound packages containing
only hazelnuts, or in open bins of nuts in grocery stores. Consumers
are advised to review the DeFranco press release for a list of
recalled products.

[2] "Smoking" nuts
Date: Wed 9 Mar 2011

Lab tests have shown that _E. coli_ O157:H7 coli found in hazelnuts
from the home of 1 of 3 Minnesotans sickened in a 3-state _E. coli_
outbreak matches the outbreak strain, Minnesota officials said today,
9 Mar 2011.

Joshua Rounds, MPH, an epidemiologist with the Minnesota Department
of Health (MDH), said the in-shell hazelnuts were collected for
testing by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture. The findings are
the 1st product test to suggest that the hazelnuts were contaminated.
Earlier epidemiologic investigations in Michigan, Minnesota, and
Wisconsin had already found that the 7 patients sickened in the
outbreak had consumed in-shell hazelnuts.

So far, the hazelnuts from one of Minnesota's 3 patients appear to be
the only ones available for testing. Spokeswomen from the Michigan and
Wisconsin health departments told CIDRAP News that none of their
patients had nuts left for testing. They also said no new illnesses in
the 2 states have been associated with the outbreak.

On 4 Mar 2011, DeFranco and Sons, based in Los Angeles, California,
recalled its bulk and consumer-pack in-shell hazelnut products after
illness investigations in Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin linked
them to 7 _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections. The company said it received
the in-shell nuts from suppliers and growers and distributed them
nationwide and to Canada.

In other developments, a hazelnut packer that distributed some of the
products is refusing to share the names of farm sources with FDA
investigators, the Capital Press, a grower industry website, reported.
In the 4 mar 2011 FDA recall notice, George Packing was listed as one
of the brands distributed by DeFranco and Sons.

Shaun George, a representative of George Packing Co., based in
Newberg, Oregon, told the Capital Press the company declined to share
the grower names with the FDA, because the information is proprietary
and the hazelnuts had not been definitively linked to the _E. coli_
illnesses.

George said he believed the FDA would investigate practices at the
farms, where nuts are harvested off the ground.

Other nuts are harvested off the ground as well, but in 2007, the US
Department of Agriculture said California almonds had to comply with
new pasteurization regulations established in response to _Salmonella_
outbreaks linked to almonds. The rule was developed by the Almond
Board of California, an industry group. California is the world's
largest almond producer.

The USA is the world's 3rd largest hazelnut producer, behind Turkey
and Italy. About 99 per cent of the nation's hazelnut crop is grown in
Oregon's Willamette Valley, according to an Iowa State University
industry profile. In 2008 USA growers sold 22 400 tons of in-shell
hazelnuts.

[3] Canada: possible cases
Date: Sat 5 Mar 2011

<http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/story/2011/03/05/alberta-cfia-hazelnut-recall-ecoli-110305.html>


People in Alberta and elsewhere in Canada are being warned about
possible _E. coli_ contamination of imported in-shell hazelnuts. The
Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) issued an alert Friday [4 Mar
2011] about the shipment of hazelnuts, also known as filberts. A
number of Americans have fallen ill after eating the packaged in-shell
nuts, which have been recalled by USA-based distributor DeFranco &
Sons.

Hazelnuts recalled due to potential _E. coli_ contamination were sold
under the brand name Sunripe as either plain hazelnuts or mixed nuts
with sell-by dates of 30 Jun 2011.

2 Canadians have fallen ill with a strain of _E. coli_ that matches
the genetic fingerprint of the strain responsible for the illnesses in
the USA. The Public Health Agency of Canada is investigating whether
the Canadian illnesses are also linked to the nuts.

Recalled nuts were also sold in bulk as Imperial Mixed Nuts, Supreme
Mixed Nuts, or as plain hazelnuts any time after 16 Nov 2010. The bulk
nuts may have been repackaged into smaller, unlabelled units, the CFIA
noted.

The affected nuts have been distributed in Alberta, Manitoba,
Saskatchewan, and Ontario. The CFIA said the nuts may also have been
distributed elsewhere in Canada.

[In-shell nuts represent an unusual vehicle for the transmission of
an enteric bacillary illness such as _E. coli_ O157:H7. Contamination
may have occurred when the nut fell to the ground but, as noted in the
CIDRAP post, a pasteurization process should have occurred after
harvesting. The finding of the same strain in uneaten nuts ("smoking"
gun, or in this case nuts) confirms the epidemiologic link to the
vehicle. - Mod.LL]
