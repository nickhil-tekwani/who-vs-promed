[Detection of MERS-CoV infections within Saudi Arabia are continuing on an almost daily basis. In the past 24 hours, there have been 2 newly confirmed cases, one in Dawadmy (a.k.a. Dawadmi, a town located approximately 200 km or 120 miles west of Riyadh as the crow flies, but approximately 320 km or 200 miles by road west of Riyadh), the other in Najran (located in the southwestern part of Saudi Arabia near the border with Yemen). There was another case reported from Dawadny on 3 Jul 2016 in a 24-year-old expat who had a history of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. As for Najran, this is now the 5th case of MERS-CoV infection reported from Najran since 18 Jun 2016. The other 4 cases included an 82-year-old Saudi male, a 44-year-old Saudi male, a 28-year-old Saudi male healthcare worker, and a 74-year-old Saudi male. Of these 4 cases, 3 were classified as primary cases (only one had a known history of contact with camels), and one was classified as a secondary household contact (this was the 28-year-old healthcare worker). Perhaps a cluster of transmission is occurring in Najran, although it is a city with an over 100 000 population, one of the fastest growing cities in Saudi Arabia.

A map showing the locations of these newly confirmed cases can be found at the source URL. The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=4333745,131. - Mod.MPP]

[This media report, while not providing new information that hasn't already been published, does provide an insight into the concerns in the Middle East region that are being recognized. Yet the same concern does not appear to be raised at the global international level. One hopes that this will not be the year with transmission to individuals making their pilgrimages to Saudi Arabia and returning to countries with low index of suspicion for MERS-CoV infection. Time will tell. - Mod.MPP]
