[According to the information published by the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (FASFC) found at http://www.afsca.be/animalhealth/avianinfluenza/ (last update 2 Jun 2017):

"Between February 3th 2017 and June 2nd 2017, 6 cases of HPAI (subtype H5N8) were identified in Belgium's wild bird population. Two of these HPAI contaminations were found in captive wild birds. Those cases were notified to the OIE in accordance with the provisions included in Article 1.1.3 of the OIE Terrestrial Code.

No outbreak of HPAI in poultry has been identified since 2003.

Avian influenza is not present in Belgian poultry farms. Poultry and poultry products from Belgium remain safe.

Since avian influenza is not present on poultry farms, Belgium is still considered as « free » of this disease pursuant to the definitions contained in the OIE terrestrial code (chapter 10.4).

In Belgium, permanent biosecurity measures are in place in the higher risk areas (resting places and/or areas with a high density of migratory birds), so as to avoid any contact between domestic poultry and wild birds". - Mod.CRD
