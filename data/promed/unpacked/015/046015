The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 10 Apr 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 1206, of which 1140 are confirmed and 66 are probable;
- In total, there were 764 deaths (698 confirmed and 66 probable) and 358 people healed;
- 246 suspected cases are under investigation;
- 20 new confirmed cases, including 8 in Katwa, 7 in Vuhovi, 2 in Mabalako, 1 in Butembo, 1 in Komanda, and 1 in Beni;
- A new patient from Katwa volunteered for the CTE as soon as the 1st symptoms appeared; the 2 cases of Mabalako are the parents of a confirmed case of Katwa (who died on 6 Apr 2019) who had fled to Mabalako to avoid the teams of the riposte. The couple was found in an unsafe area of Mabalako at an advanced stage of the disease but refused to be transferred to the CTE;
- 13 new confirmed deaths, of which 6 were community deaths, including 2 in Katwa, 2 in Mabalako, 1 in Butembo, and 1 in Komanda; 7 deaths at CTE, including 6 in Katwa, and 1 in Butembo;
- 4 new healings, including 3 from the Butembo CTE and 1 from the Beni CTE;
- Follow-up of the 107 contacts identified around the confirmed case of Bunia.

News of the response

Butembo Airfield
--------------
Two workers from Rughenda Airport in Butembo were transferred to the Butembo Ebola treatment center after laboratory tests confirmed that they had been infected with the Ebola virus disease. This is an Air Rale (RVA) agent and a porter who had attended the unsecured burial of a deceased Ebola acquaintance.
-This Thursday [11 Apr 2019], the teams of the response vaccinated all the agents of the airport and disinfected all the airport facilities of this small earthen airport, which receives only small carriers. Flights at Rughenda Airport have not been disrupted by response activities, but the authorities plan to strengthen epidemiological surveillance and sanitary control at the airport.

World Health Organization Emergency Committee
--------------------------
- Dr Tedros Adhanom, director-general of WHO, called on the Emergency Committee for International Health Regulations to meet for the 2nd time this Friday [12 Apr 2019] to determine whether the epidemic is now a public health emergency of international concern.
- The role of this committee is to recommend to the director-general of WHO emergency measures, called temporary recommendations, to be adopted. These temporary recommendations include the health measures to be put in place by the country where the emergency is declared or by other countries to reduce the risk of international spread of the epidemic and to avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic. The committee will continue to advise the director-general throughout the duration of the emergency, including any necessary changes to the recommended actions.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 97 903 people have been vaccinated [see URL for numbers of vaccinees from each location. - Mod.LK]

[The number of new confirmed cases detected in one day increased again, to 20. It is good the Emergency Committee for International Health Regulations will meet to assess the need for declaration of a public health emergency of international concern. It is time to take this extreme measure to ramp up response and stop this outbreak. The neighboring countries and local government of the DRC are to be commended for containing the virus within the DRC, but the risk increases as more individuals are infected. - Mod.LK]

[Helen Branswell @HelenBranswell (https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell)
1. Worst day yet, new case-wise, in the North Kivu #Ebola outbreak. +18 new cases, including 11 at Katwa. @MinSanteRDC is also reporting 10 deaths, 8 of them community deaths. Community deaths spread Ebola. Long way from here to over, I fear.
2. The outbreak totals are now 1186 #Ebola cases and 751 deaths. Only 341 doses of vaccine were used between yesterday and today, which seems far too low given how many cases there have been lately.
3. Another health worker has been infected, the 87th; 31 have died so far. Don't ask me if these health workers were vaccinated. That info is not publicly available. But this information needs to be shared. Health workers should be vaccinated, shouldn't be contracting #Ebola.]

News of the response

Record number of cures unloaded in Butembo
---------------------
During the week of 1 Apr 2019, 17 cured patients were discharged from the Butembo CTE, a record never before achieved. Dr. Richard Kitenge, national coordinator of CTE and country leader for Ebola virus disease (EVD), hopes that this good news will help change people's perceptions of ETC. In the town of Butembo, many patients avoided or refused to be transferred to the ETC for fear of dying there. Thus, the patients arrived at the CTE at an advanced stage of the disease too late to be able to be saved.
- Despite the persistence of a high rate of community deaths in Butembo town, it has been observed that an increasing number of sick people detected in the community or local health facilities agree to be transferred to the CTE soon after early symptoms, thus increasing their chance of survival. As a reminder, 80% of patients (i.e., 8 out of 10 patients) who were taken care of less than 3 days after the onset of symptoms have come out of ETCs.
- Since the reopening of the Katwa and Butembo CTEs, changes have been made in the medical management of patients. The capacity of the Butembo CTE is now 94 beds, and that of the Katwa CTE is 76 beds.

-At the Butembo CTE, the number of nursing staff increased from 62 to 90 nurses and from 14 to 32 physicians, all recruited locally. The caregivers were divided into 3 teams: a team exclusively responsible for admissions to reduce the waiting time for patients arriving at the CTE, a team for monitoring patients in stable condition, and a last larger team for follow-up of patients in critical condition. For patients in serious condition, psychologists are assigned to families to accompany them throughout the process. Psychologists serve as a link between CTE families and doctors to explain the evolution of the patient's medical situation in a simple and regular way to families. Families of patients are allowed to visit their sick relatives every day with the support of the health promotion teams. In addition, the therapeutic molecules are used again but in the context of the former therapeutic protocol for compassionate purposes and no longer in the context of the clinical trial.

Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 97 035 people have been vaccinated.

- Wed 10 Apr 2019. DRC sees record-setting day, with 18 Ebola cases
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/04/drc-sees-record-setting-day-18-ebola-cases
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Today [Wed 10 Apr 2019] the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) recorded 18 new cases in the ongoing Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri province, the largest single-day jump since the outbreak began last August [2018]. The previous record was 16 cases, on 7 Apr [2019].

The spike in cases raises the outbreak total to 1186, which includes 1120 confirmed and 66 probable infections. Officials also confirmed 10 new deaths, raising the fatality count to 751. Ten of the new deaths occurred in the community, which raises the risk of disease spread.

In light of these developments, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, announced today he has reconvened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) on Ebola in the DRC. According to a press release from the WHO emailed to journalists, the committee will meet on 12 Apr [2019] in Geneva to decide whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, and what recommendations should be made to manage the outbreak. This will be the 2nd meeting of the committee on this outbreak; the 1st took place in October [2018].

"A rising number of security incidents have been restricting access to affected communities in key areas for vital operations such as surveillance, case investigation, contact tracing, and vaccination," the WHO said. "Transmission has intensified in Butembo/Katwa and surrounding health zones of Vuhovi and Massereka. These factors have led to an increase in cases reported in recent weeks, after a period of decline."

Of the 18 cases recorded today by the DRC, 11 are in Katwa, 3 in Vuhovi, 3 in Mandima, and 1 in Beni.

In its latest outbreak update yesterday, the WHO said 199 cases have been confirmed in the 21 days from 18 Mar to 7 Apr [2019]. Between 1 and 7 Apr [2019] alone, the DRC recorded 65 cases of the viral hemorrhagic disease, predominantly in Katwa, Mandima, Butembo, and Vuhovi, the WHO said. In total, 8 health zones reported cases from 5 Apr-7 Apr [2019], and in the past 3 weeks, 13 health zones reported new cases. Katwa has the most Ebola cases in recent weeks, with 69.

In addition, cases recorded since 7 Apr [2019] illustrate even further that the month [April 2019] is shaping up to be the outbreak's worst, according to data from the DRC health ministry. Officials recorded 40 cases in the 3 days since 7 Apr [2019], or 105 in 10 days, more than 10 per day.

"The number of new confirmed cases continues to rise, and the geographical spread of these new cases makes robust contact tracing and line-listing difficult," the WHO said, noting that the continued infection of healthcare workers is of particular concern.

As of 7 Apr [2019] [http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/04/drc-sees-record-setting-day-18-ebola-cases2019], a total of 85 health workers had been infected with the virus, 30 fatally, the WHO said. The case-fatality rate of the outbreak stands at 63%, with 57% of cases occurring in female patients and 29% in children.

In the 1st week of April [2019], health officials in the DRC received an average of 1100 alerts per day, of which an average of 992 (90.2%) were investigated within 24 hours of reporting. Officials have been able to track 83%-87% of contacts, with 8678 contacts currently under surveillance.

Eight labs in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces currently test all samples for Ebola, and, as of this week [week of Mon 8 Apr 2019], the laboratory in Katwa has been equipped to sequence whole-virus genomes in order to provide virus transmission chain analysis.

Medical teams in the outbreak zones are also holding specialty eye clinics for survivors, the WHO said in a news story today. After the West Africa outbreak of 2014-2016, researchers discovered that up to 20% of Ebola survivors develop significant eye problems.

The WHO said ring vaccination campaigns continue in Beni, Katwa, Butembo, Mandima, Bunia, Vuhovi, and Lubero health zones around confirmed cases, and in Goma for front-line providers. Officials have now vaccinated 97 376 people in the DRC, its health ministry said.

Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo

The rise in number of Ebola virus diseases cases observed in the North Kivu [and Ituri] provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues this week. During the last 21 days (20 Mar-9 Apr 2019), 57 health areas within 11 health zones reported new cases, with 40% of the 141 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 207 probable and confirmed cases were reported from Katwa (83), Vuhovi (41), Mandima (29), Beni (21), Butembo (15), Oicha (8), Masereka (4), Lubero (2), Musienene (2), Kalunguta (1), and Mabalako (1).

As of 9 Apr [2019], a total of 1186 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 751 died (case fatality ratio 63%). Of the 1186 cases with reported age and sex, 57% (675) were female, and 29% (341) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 87 (7% of total cases), including 31 deaths. To date, a total of 354 EVD patients who received care at Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) have been discharged.

WHO experts to decide whether Congo Ebola outbreak is international emergency
--------------------

The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday [10 Apr 2019] said it had reconvened an expert panel to consider whether an outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.

The panel, which 1st met on this issue in October 2018, will also give updated recommendations on how global health officials should manage the outbreak, the WHO said in a statement from its Geneva headquarters.

At least 740 people have died among the more than 1100 infected in this epidemic, which began in August 2018.

Declaring the outbreak a "public health emergency of international concern," or PHEIC, would ramp up the international response with a formal alert that puts governments on notice and helps to mobilize resources and research.

The WHO said that while the outbreak is contained to the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, efforts to bring it under control in these urban areas have been hampered by security and access problems. As a result, it said, Ebola transmission has increased in some areas.

"Though the risk of spread within the country and to neighboring countries is very high, the risk remains low globally," the WHO statement added.

The emergency panel's meeting will take place on Friday [12 Apr 2019], and its decision will be published late the same day.

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1817070

As the Democratic Republic of Congo's (DRC's) 10th outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) rages in this resource-limited, war-torn region, advances in the delivery of supportive care and the introduction of investigational therapies provide a glimmer of hope amid the mounting infections. In the absence of effective therapies or vaccines, EVD outbreak response has centered around the most basic of public health principles: identification and isolation of patients with suspected and confirmed EVD and tracking of all the contacts of the confirmed patients, who are then rapidly isolated if they show signs of disease. This strategy of "identify, isolate, and track" allows public health responders to curtail and eventually eliminate virus transmission in the community and has been the foundation of EVD outbreak-control efforts since the disease was 1st described in 1976.

Strategies for protecting susceptible communities have not always benefited patients, however. Within what were once routinely called EVD isolation units -- now known as Ebola treatment units -- supportive care was typically limited to the most basic measures, such as providing oral rehydration salts and acetaminophen. Unsurprisingly, case fatality ratios were high, which fueled community mistrust and resistance to broader outbreak-control efforts. The prolonged 2013-2016 EVD outbreak in West Africa allowed for an evolution of care that, by the time the outbreak was declared over, saw many patients receiving intravenous volume repletion, antibiotics, and antimalarials, potentially contributing to the downward trend in case fatality ratios. In effect, as the epidemic waned, a new standard of care emerged, along with the important and enduring lesson that substantial progress in the clinical care of patients with EVD was not only possible but most likely essential to improving patient outcomes.

It should no longer be acceptable to have 2 standards of care: one for patients in resource-constrained settings and another for those in countries where resources are more readily available. The ongoing response to EVD is teaching us that higher standards are no longer aspirational but are possible, and that during inevitable future outbreaks of EVD, no matter how remote the setting, we can provide people who are sick and suffering with the type of care that we would want to receive.

- Tue 9 Apr 2019. Awareness campaigns

https://www.radiookapi.net/2019/04/09/actualite/sante/nord-kivu-une-ong-sensibilise-300-enfants-de-la-rue-contre-ebola

On 9 Apr [2019], the Union of Oppressed Women (UFO) launched an awareness campaign for 300 "street children" against the Ebola virus. Several sites in the communes of Goma and Nyiragongo have been targeted. The NGO UFO justifies this activity by the vulnerability of this social stratum in the city of Goma and the territory of Nyiragongo, with the outbreak of the epidemic that has already [affected] more than 1000 people.

Jeanne Kamitiango, coordinator of the UFO, talks about the strategy to sensitize these children, most of whom cannot read or write: "We have leaflets, we will show them signs, we will show them how to take care of their hands . . ."

This awareness campaign involves more than 3000 "street children" living in the 2 communes of Goma and the neighboring territory of Nyiragongo.

[STAT News, abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2019/04/10/who-asks-panel-to-weigh-whether-ebola-outbreak-is-global-emergency/
[Byline: Helen Branswell]

There was hope that an experimental Ebola vaccine, made by Merck, would help to contain the outbreak. And WHO officials insist that, but for the vaccine, this outbreak would be many times more severe than it already is. More than 97 000 doses of the vaccine have been administered so far in this outbreak.

But failings of the response are undermining the vaccine's effectiveness. The vaccine is being used in what is called a ring vaccination approach: it is being offered to people who are known contacts of cases and the contacts of the contacts, as well as health workers and other frontline workers. The idea is to prevent spread of the virus by protecting people who are in contact with cases.

For that approach to work, the Ebola response needs to be able to identify as many contacts as possible. But in many cases, they have been unable to do the contact tracing work needed to draw up detailed lists; cases have occurred in neighborhoods or villages where it is unsafe for them to work. As a result, many people who should have been vaccinated have not appeared on the vaccination list.

The prolonged length of this outbreak has raised concerns that supplies of the vaccine might run out. Merck has promised to try to maintain a stockpile of 300 000 doses. At the time that figure was struck, 300 000 doses seemed like a large cushion. But this outbreak has made it clear the size of the stockpile will need to be revisited.

- Wed 10 April 2019. Eye care for Ebola survivors
[WHO, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/eye-care-for-ebola-survivors

Knowledge gained following the 2014-16 West Africa Ebola outbreak identified a number of challenges survivors face, including reduced or blurred vision stemming from inflammation of their eyes. About 20% of survivors from that outbreak had some form of eye problem.

By identifying and treating these problems early, serious consequences, including blindness, can be averted. With the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the World Health Organization recently organized an eye clinic to check on the eye health of survivors of the current Ebola outbreak.

The clinic was held in Beni, DRC, one of the affected areas, from 25 Mar to 1 Apr [2019]. In addition, an eye clinic in Butembo, another affected area, was equipped so that they can provide this specialized care to survivors there. This is the 1st time in an Ebola outbreak that follow-up for eye care has happened so soon after survivors have been released from care.

Several survivors also helped with the planning and administration of the clinic. Partners in this project include Emory University, which deployed 2 ophthalmologists, and University of North Carolina, which deployed one ophthalmologist to the project via the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, which is hosted by WHO.

Over 250 survivors were seen. The team noted that complications such as uveitis were observed at lower rates compared to cases from the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak. So far only one survivor had eye complications that may be linked to Ebola.

As part of the programme, international specialists trained 10 Congolese ophthalmologists on how to identify and treat Ebola-related eye issues. Feedback from participating national healthcare providers and enrolled survivors was overwhelmingly positive.

Next steps will be to continue to follow up with survivors at the clinics held each month, where they are provided medical, biological, and psychological care. There are currently over 300 survivors registered in the follow-up programme.
