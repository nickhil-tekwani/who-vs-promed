The state veterinarian is announcing the detection of _Theileria orientalis_ Ikeda in a herd of cattle in Middle Tennessee.

_Theileria_ is a tickborne parasite that infects red and white blood cells and causes severe anemia in cattle. There is no vaccine to prevent the illness or effective treatment. Once an animal is infected, it is a carrier for life.

The affected herd in Maury County showed signs of illness and lethargy, and despite veterinary attention and antibiotic treatments, ultimately some animals died.

_Theileria_ is not a threat to human health. Humans cannot become sick from contact with affected cattle, and consuming meat from affected cattle is safe provided the meat has been cooked to an appropriate temperature.

"The Asian long-horned tick (ALT) is a common vector for this illness," State Veterinarian Dr. Samantha Beaty said. "Although we have not yet confirmed the presence of ALT in Maury County, we know it's already taken hold in several other Tennessee counties and will continue to spread. Cattle producers should take steps to protect their herds."

Producers can minimize risk by keeping cattle out of wooded areas and keeping pastures mowed short, particularly pastures bordering woods. Producers should also regularly inspect cattle for ticks, use varying types of acaricides (ear tags, pours, back rubbers, etc.), use a clean needle for every injection, and notify a veterinarian if cattle show signs of lethargy or illness.

In partnership with the University of Tennessee and Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine Diagnostic Lab, the Tennessee Department of Agriculture is collecting tick and blood samples from cattle to help identify the presence of the Asian long-horned tick and _Theileria orientalis_ Ikeda in Tennessee.

The Tennessee Department of Agriculture is testing blood samples for _Theileria_ for free until 29 Jul 2022. Results are available to producers upon request. Information gathered will be used to create county-level maps of tick and _Theileria_ spread. Farm and ownership information will not be shared with the public. If you would like to submit tick samples for identification or blood samples for _Theileria_ testing, please contact the state veterinarian's office or <Animal.health@tn.gov> for more information.

["What is _Theileria orientalis_ Ikeda?
"_Theileria orientalis_ is a tickborne protozoon infecting red and white blood cells and causing bovine infectious anemia. Clinical signs of theileriosis are similar to anaplasmosis in cattle and include anemia, jaundice, and weakness. Native genotypes of _T. orientalis_ in the United States are usually nonpathogenic; however, _Theileria orientalis_ genotype Ikeda is a virulent strain novel to US cattle. _T. orientalis_ Ikeda infections have been reported to cause mortality in up to 5% of infected cattle. Pregnant heifers and calves are particularly susceptible to the infection. Additional factors, such as breed or age, may increase disease susceptibility in cattle. Clinical findings include weakness, reluctance to walk, and abortion. Physical examination may reveal pale mucus membranes, high fever, and elevated heart and respiratory rates. Cattle that recover from _Theileria_ infections usually become carriers, which is a source of infection for other cattle in the herd.

"Transmission
"This is a blood-borne disease, so cattle are thought to become infected within 3 weeks of being placed on pasture containing infected tick vectors. Disease is seen more frequently when naive animals are introduced into an endemic area or when infected animals are introduced to a herd where a competent vector is present. _Theileria_ sporozoites (the infective stage) are transmitted to susceptible animals during tick feeding through the tick's saliva, or through needles that have been used on an infected animal, then a naive animal. The incubation period is about 10-14 days after a tick feeds, and if environmental temperatures are high, infective sporozoites can develop in ticks on the ground (off host) and may enter the host within hours of tick attachment. Ticks can remain infected on a pasture for up to 2 years under favorable conditions.

"Treatment
"There is not an approved effective treatment or vaccine for _T. orientalis_. Because of this, prevention and biosecurity are imperative.

"Prevention and Control
- Regularly inspect cattle for ticks. The ALT is small and may go unnoticed with only a quick look. Focus on the head and the neck, but also check the flanks and back, the armpits and groin, and under the tail. Tick larvae, nymphs, and adults may all be found at the same time on a single animal.
- Cattle with low weight gain, are lethargic or anemic, have patchy hair, or generally look unthrifty should always be inspected for ticks.
- Animals may have large numbers of ALT, but only a few ALTs may be sufficient to transmit cattle disease. Submit tick samples to your local Extension agent or veterinarian for species confirmation.
- Once ALT is confirmed on your animals, you should assume it is established in the area and that management for this tick will be a continuing process.

"Chemical Control
- There appears to be an elevated risk of cattle disease transmission by ALT in February-March and August-September. Tick control is highly recommended during these time periods, but ALTs are active during much of the year. Consider chemical control for ALT from March into November.
- A single pesticide application method may not be fully effective against ALT. Consider using pesticide-impregnated ear-tags along with backrubbers and other devices.
- Ear tags: Use permethrin or organophosphate ear tags. However, ear tags will not be effective in areas that the tick prefers. Do not mix classes of chemicals with insect control. Use the same class of chemicals for 1-2 years, then rotate.
- Use backrubbers and siderubbers ("bullets") or similar devices charged with permethrin. Hang rubs in such a way that cattle must contact the rub as they move past, spreading the pesticide along the top of their bodies. Vertical strips hung from a backrubber help apply material to the head and flanks as the cattle move past.
- Recharge devices regularly following the pesticide label. ALT management may require recharging devices every 2-3 weeks.
- Pour-ons: Use permethrin at the rate recommended on the label. Apply along the topline of the animal in a narrow strip; start at the back of the withers and continue all the way to the tail head. Be aware that heavy rain may wash pesticides off the animal. Increased fly burdens at several days after a heavy rain may indicate the need to retreat the animal.
- Treat all animals in a herd for ticks at the same time. Apply formulations specifically labeled for tick control. Follow all label recommendations for all pesticides (including ear tags, backrubbers, pour-ons, etc.) used, including time to retreat, withdrawal periods, beef vs. dairy, lactating vs. dry, use of personal protection, etc.
- Chemical treatment of pastures is not recommended except when tick populations are extremely large. Carbaryl (Sevin) labeled for use on pastures should be restricted to sections of the pasture with the highest number of ticks. Pasture treatments should be used in conjunction with other treatments.
- Chemical control greatly reduces tick burdens on animals but does not eliminate the chance of ticks, tick bites, or acquiring tick-borne diseases

"Herd Management
- Inspect purchased cattle for ticks and treat if found before adding to the established herd.
- Consider having animals tested by a vet for tickborne disease if ticks are found on them, especially if the cattle are not gaining weight, have patchy hair, appear lethargic, or show signs of anemia.
- Keep pastures mowed short as long grass and brush enhance ALT survival. Leaving pastures ungrazed will not control ticks as they can survive about a year without feeding. Wildlife in the ungrazed pastures will support tick survival in the absence of cattle too.
- Mow pastures short before rotating stock back into them, even if the cattle have been treated for ticks.
- Keep cattle out of wooded areas. If possible, fence cattle 20 feet away from wooded areas.
- Wildlife, such as deer, small mammals, and birds, can serve as alternative hosts for ticks and assist their spread.
- Check pets if any ticks are found on cattle.
- People working in areas infested with ticks of any species should inspect themselves regularly for ticks.

"It is important the movement of this tick is documented to prevent disease. Dr. Rebecca Trout-Fryxell is a UT entomologist who is extremely helpful in monitoring the movement of this tick in TN. She has distributed tick collection kits to your local county Extension agents for collection and submission of ticks to keep track of the movement of ALT. If you find ticks on your cattle, contact your local Extension agent or veterinarian so the tick can be submitted to our entomology department for identification. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me [Lew Strickland DVM, Extension veterinarian, Department of Animal Science, University of Tennessee], 865-974-3538, <lstrick5@utk.edu> , or http://www.askdrlew.tennessee.edu."

Remember to check yourself for ticks. They can easily crawl up your boots or jeans to the waistline of pants and burrow in. Be sure to check your neck and ears as these ticks can easily be missed but will feed from a human being. Ticks are capable of passing a variety of ailments to human beings. - Mod.TG
