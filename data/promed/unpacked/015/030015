In Taiwan, 2 people were recently diagnosed with Japanese encephalitis, bringing the number of cases in the country so far this year [2018] to 5, the [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said on Tuesday [5 Jun 2018].

The 2 recent cases of the mosquitoborne disease were in Kaohsiung and Chiayi and were confirmed after the patients sought medical attention on 27 and 28 May [2018], respectively, said CDC deputy director-general Philip Lo.

It was found that the man in Kaohsiung, in his 30s, was living near 2 other people who had been diagnosed earlier in the year with Japanese encephalitis, Lo said. The patient in Chiayi, a man in his 50s, was most likely infected [at work], as he works with live poultry in an area near irrigation canals, Lo said. He said the 2 men were in hospital in stable condition and the people with whom they had had contact were not showing any signs of infection so far.

According to CDC statistics, 3 of the 5 cases of Japanese encephalitis in Taiwan this year [2018] were recorded in Kaohsiung, while the other 2 were in Chiayi and Pingtung counties.

In Taiwan, Japanese encephalitis is usually prevalent from May to October each year and peaks between June and July, according to the CDC. It said the disease is transmitted mainly by the _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ mosquito, which breeds in rice fields, ponds and irrigation canals.

The CDC has advised that people avoid visiting such places and animal farms, especially at dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active, and to make sure their young children are vaccinated against the disease. Japanese encephalitis can cause serious psychological and neurological symptoms and has a mortality rate of 20-30 per cent, according to the CDC.

[The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission is now getting under way in Taiwan, as indicated the 2 new cases mentioned above. We expect cases to occur sporadically until the transmission season ends in October 2018. This mosquito species, _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_, is an efficient vector of JEV.

The number of JE cases last year (2017) in Taiwan reached 25. JE virus is endemic in Taiwan and has caused cases sporadically there during the May-October season. Culex mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people.

Japanese encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease; the affected individuals above probably had not been vaccinated. The advice to ensure that children are vaccinated is prudent. The only measures to prevent infection are vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites. Well targeted vector mosquito reduction programs can be helpful as well.
