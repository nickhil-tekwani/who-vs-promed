Deadly [Crimean-Congo] hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has claimed the life of a youngster at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) on [Mon 1 Apr 2019], after which the death toll due to the fever mounted to 3 this year [2019].

Executive Director, JPMC, Dr Seemi Jamali, while talking to PPI [Pakistan Press International], confirmed the death of [a] 19-year-old [patient] from Congo fever who was brought to the health facility 2 days ago with high grade-fever and bleeding from nose and mouth.

The deceased from Sehwan Shareef [Sindh] died during treatment last night [31 Mar 2019]. Lab reports confirmed that the patient was suffering from Congo fever.

A total of 3 people including 2 women have died from the deadly Congo fever so far at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre this year [2019].

CCHF is a tick-borne viral disease that is mainly contracted by people who deal with cattle and livestock. The symptoms of Congo virus include backache, joint pain, pain in the abdomen, high fever, and bleeding from any part of the body.
