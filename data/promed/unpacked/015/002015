Execs to probe food poisoning of teachers
-----------------------------------------------
City Mayor Noel Rosal has ordered a thorough investigation of the case of
food poisoning due to bad chop suey, which sent about 114 teachers to
different hospitals in Legazpi City on Mon 12 Dec 2005.
City budget officer Ofelia Baldano said she learned that what was supposed
to be on the menu were rice, pork chops and pinakbet. [Pinkabet is a
vegetable medley dish served throughout the Philippines, commonly at lunch
or dinner. The main ingredient in this dish is ampalaya, also known as
"bitter melon." The spice named bagoong (pork and shrimp paste) adds a
unique flavor. - Mod.LL]. But teacher-patients interviewed by the Inquirer
said it was chop suey that they ate at lunch time after their activities
during the Teachers Day celebration on Mon 12 Dec 2005.
The City Hall partly shouldered the cost of the meals for about 1000
teachers. The catering service was contracted by the Legazpi City Teachers
Association. Hours after taking the food, the affected teachers suffered
from continuous abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration starting
Mon night, 12 Dec 2005.
The Inquirer went to the residence of the caterer, Veronica Rogando, a
former Department of Education Legazpi City Division district supervisor,
to get her side of the story, but a housekeeper said she was not around.
Dr. Rogelio Rivera, chief of the Bicol Regional Training and Teaching
Hospital (BRTTH) based in this city, confirmed that the teachers were
positive for food poisoning due to chop suey as claimed by his patients. At
least 64 victims were taken to the BRTTH as of Tuesday night, 13 Dec 2005,
but most of them were discharged on the following morning after showing
signs of recovery. Only 6 were left as of yesterday afternoon, 14 Dec 2005,
as they were still under observation, including 4 pregnant teachers who
gave birth ahead of schedule, one by caesarian operation.

[The etiology of this food-borne illness is not clear. The short duration
of illness speaks more towards a toxin-mediated disease, and prominent
diarrhea suggests either _Clostridum perfringes_ (beef is a common vehicle)
or _Bacillus cereus_ (rice is the classic vehicle) disease. - Mod.LL]
