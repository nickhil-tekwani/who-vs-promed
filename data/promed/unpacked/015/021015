Equine herpesvirus type 1: Neurologic Disease and Antibody Testing
---------------------------------------------------
A string of postings [see ProMED-mail archive references listed below]
since the start of 2003 has recorded multiple occurrences of Equine
herpesvirus type 1 (EHV1) neurologic disease (myeloencephalitis) in the
United States and the United Kingdom. There are 2 alphaherpesviruses that
commonly cause respiratory disease in horses: Equine herpesvirus type 4
(EHV4), which for the sake of a single, common unambiguous name and for
historic reasons is called equine rhinopneumonitis virus, and EHV1, for
which the common name equine abortion virus is used. This nomenclature was
adopted by the International Committee on Taxonomy of viruses (ICTV)
although it has not been universally adopted including by the OIE, so that
ambiguity, particularly in the use of the name equine rhinopneumonitis
virus, persists even though the two viruses were shown to be quite distinct
some time ago (1,2). Each virus is deserving of a single universally
accepted common name. Clinically EHV4 is mostly recognised as a cause of
respiratory disease, whereas EHV1 causes respiratory disease, abortion,
perinatal foal mortality, and myeloencephalitis.
As the ProMED-mail reports highlight, EHV1 neurologic disease is a
devastating disease with high mortality among affected horses and
significant neurological deficits in horses that survive. Early, accurate,
and specific diagnosis can be challenging. Virus isolation, polymerase
chain reaction, and immunoperoxidase staining (postmortem) are key to
identifying the virus. The UK reports refer to serological testing in which
complement fixation assays are used. Serum neutralisation assays are also
widely used for testing for antibody to the 2 viruses. However, neither of
these conventional assays can be relied upon to discriminate between horses
infected with one or other or both of the 2 viruses because many antibodies
to the 2 viruses are cross-reactive.
What is available is a highly specific, robust EHV1/EHV4 specific antibody
detection ELISA. The antigens used are recombinant proteins in which the
highly variable C terminal domain of glycoprotein G of each virus is fused
with GST (3,4). Epitopes within the C terminal domains are dominant in the
sense that all infected horses develop antibody to these epitopes. And the
epitopes are highly specific in detecting antibody to each of the viruses
(i.e., there is no cross-reactivity).
It has been shown that for EHV1 abortion (5) and EHV1 myeloencephalitis
(unpublished) that specific EHV1 antibody seronegativity based on the
EHV1/EHV4 antibody detection ELISA is a predictor of susceptibility in
outbreak situations. Testing implemented early in an outbreak can aid
specific diagnosis, risk assessment, and management. The test has also been
used for meaningful seroepidemiologic studies (6.7). The EHV1/4 antibody
detection ELISA was developed at the Centre of Equine Virology, the
University of Melbourne, and is available commercially (SVANOVIR EHV1/4-Ab
ELISA, Svanova Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden; ).
