A 10-year-old child was infected by a hantavirus in Carahue, Araucania region and remains in serious condition in the Calvo Mackenna Hospital in Santiago. Recently, 3 people infected with this virus were reported in Araucania, one of whom died as a result of the disease.

The case of the child is being investigated where the infection might have occurred in a rural area of Carahue. The child sought medical attention at the Nueva Imperial Hospital in which the hantavirus protocols were activated and, finally, it was decided to transfer the child to the Hospital Calvo Mackenna in Santiago because of the patient's complex condition.

This past July [2021], a 44-year-old woman died as a result of a hantavirus infection in the Curacautin community [see Hantavirus - Americas (08): Chile (AR) 20210730.8555732].

The Araucania Health SEREMI [Regional Health Ministerial Secretariat] issued an announcement for people to avoid exposure to hantaviruses, a disease [virus] that is transmitted in the urine of the wild long-tailed mouse.

[We thank Mahmoud Orabi for submitting this report. One hopes that the child survives the infection, which has a relatively high case fatality rate. Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur there every year. Andes virus can be transmitted directly person to person but only with very close physical proximity, usually within the family. However, unless specific laboratory tests are done, Seoul hantavirus cannot be ruled out.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY
