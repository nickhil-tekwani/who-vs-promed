Chile declares dengue fever health alert on Easter Island
---------------------------------------------------------
SANTIAGO: The Chilean government declared a health alert on Easter Island
(3700 km/2229 miles) west of the continent, following the confirmation of a
case of dengue fever, the Health Ministry announced on Sat 16 Mar 2002. "We
have declared a health alert on Easter Island following the appearance of
its first case of contagious dengue," assistant health minister Gonzalo
Navarrete said after traveling to the Chilean territory with a group of
specialists to investigate a possible outbreak of the disease on the
island. The Public Health Institute confirmed on Fri 15 Mar 2002 that a 21
year old woman contracted the disease a few days ago, but has now been
released from the hospital. The Health Ministry said it was not certain if
the woman had contracted dengue fever during her 3 month stay on Easter
Island or upon arrival in Santiago.
Nevertheless, the director of the hospital on Easter Island, Dr Cristian
Perez, confirmed that the facility had treated at least 6 patients with
symptoms of dengue fever. "We have one suspicious case to confirm, but none
of the patients are in serious condition," Perez told the state-run
television station. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito that transmits dengue may
have come to the island with the scores of Tahitian tourists who visited in
January, Perez added. "We will investigate any future cases of dengue, and
it is necessary for the residents of Easter Island to remain calm,"
Navarrete insisted.

Easter Island: first case of dengue fever
-----------------------------------------
Easter Island, one of the world's most isolated populated places, became
the site on Fri 15 Mar 2002 of Chile's first recent case of dengue fever,
which has reached epidemic proportions in Brazil this year and plagues 100
countries worldwide.
Health officials confirmed one case of the illness on the remote Pacific
island, known for its giant stone monoliths, and said 2 other people were
thought to have it but had not been fully diagnosed [The preceding report
does not confirm unequivocally that the confirmed case contracted infection
on Easter Island. - Mod.CP.
The disease is transmitted by [the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ and was
probably carried to the remote South Pacific island by a tourist who was
then bitten by a mosquito that spread the virus to local residents,
officials said. There have been no cases reported on mainland Chile, which
has jurisdiction over Easter Island.

[If confirmed by laboratory diagnosis, these suspected case of dengue fever
may mark the first appearance of the disease on Easter Island. These two
reports conflict as to the possible source of the virus, that is, whether
introduced by an infected tourist or by an infected mosquito. As a
precaution it would be prudent at this stage for the local authorities to
investigate the mosquito population for presence of the potential vector.
ProMED-mail would welcome further information on the disease status of
Easter Island as it becomes known. - Mod.CP
