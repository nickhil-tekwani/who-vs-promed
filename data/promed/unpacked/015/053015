Cool, damp conditions in Florida this [2015/16] winter have meant an increase in lettuce downy mildew. Primarily a foliar disease, it has a direct effect on yield and quality as it affects the marketable portion of the crop.

Transplants might be infected in the greenhouse. If downy mildew infects the cotyledons of young seedlings, the plants might die. Although yield losses in the field may be substantial, downy mildew's impact often is accentuated by significant postharvest losses during transit or storage.

Since many Florida cultivars are susceptible, downy mildew is extremely difficult to control once an outbreak has occurred. For this reason, prevention and early detection are important.

[Downy mildew of lettuce caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Bremia lactucae_ and is a common disease of both glasshouse and field-grown crops. It affects all types of lettuce and can result in severe losses by reducing both yield and quality of crops. Multiple pathotypes of the pathogen exist affecting different hosts, but lettuce strains are specific to lettuce and close relatives. Symptoms on lettuce may include yellow patches on upper leaf surfaces and white growth on the corresponding underside, followed by browning and death of infected tissue. Systemic infections may also occur leading to internal rotting of stem and leaf veins. The disease is favoured by humid conditions.

Spores are spread within a crop mainly by splashing rain, wind, or mechanical means. The pathogen survives between crops on infected plant material or in the soil as oospores which may infect the roots of the next crop. Disease management may include cultural measures to reduce humidity within a crop, crop rotation, phytosanitation, and preventative fungicide applications. The most effective means of control is planting resistant varieties.

Downy mildews include many species in several genera which cause similar symptoms on a range of hosts, including many crops. Individual species usually have a narrow host range affecting only one or a few different hosts.
