Regarding the anecdotal story about harmful ticks spread to Sweden since we
removed quarantine controls (Rabies - UK: possible quarantine changes (09))
it is true so far as the ticks came but they didn't spread over the
country. _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_ does not normally exist in Sweden.
However, when introduced into a warm house where there are dogs it may
survive and multiply indoors. This happened in a hunting lodge about 2
years ago just after a hunting party from another EU country had used it.
They had brought their own dogs as allowed by the new non-quarantine rules
and probably a lot of ticks (_R. sanguineus_). This became a new experience
to the landlord and others, but they learned for the future that dogs from
abroad should be treated for ticks and other external mites and insects
before you let them in your house.
In the days of quarantine controls we found about 5 cases of _R.
sanguineus_ per year in the Swedish quarantines.
The major threat from European dogs and cats may be _Echinococcus
multilocularis_. This is met by a demand, certified by a vet, that the
animal is dewormed with praziquantel within 10 days before entering Sweden.
