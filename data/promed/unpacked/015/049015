In The Lancet for November 21, 1998, there is a short communication from
Masato Tsukahara and colleagues entitled "_Bartonella henselae_ infection
from a dog", 352:1682. This describes an acute episode of cat scratch fever
in a ten year old boy, whose family had had a puppy for two months at the
time of onset of the child's disease. The puppy was gingiva and buccal
membrane swab PCR positive for _B.henselae_. The boy claimed not to have
been bitten by the puppy or by a cat. The authors do not otherwise indicate
whether the family had a cat.
They subsequently examined 52 dogs, origin unstated, and found 4
seropositive for _B. henselae_; x3 at 1:64 and x1 at 1:128. 3/52 dogs were
PCR positive on blood; 5/9 for oral swabs; and 5/9 for nail clippings.
While it is clear that dogs can become infected with _B. henselae_ the
article provides no evidence other than coincidence for the child being
infected from the dog although it is suggestive. In that dogs can live
their domestic lives intimately with cats, and thereby have ready access to
cat flea faeces, it is not surprising that they can become infected with
_B. henselae_. The literature on canine 'cat scratch' disease is sparse.
The canine dimension of this infection seems to have been overlooked.
