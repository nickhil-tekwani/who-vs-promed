According to Rospotrebnadzor [The Federal Service for Consumer Rights and Human Welfare], as of 20 May 2013, 7 laboratory confirmed cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] have been reported in the Rostov Region; 4 cases were recorded in the Salsk district region, 2 in the Proletarsk district, and one in the Martynovsky district.

The situation with regard to CCHF in the Rostov region is worrying. The majority of municipalities lie in territory that includes natural foci of CCHF infection. According to Rospotrebnadzor, last month [April 2013], 403 persons, including 124 children under 14 years old, sought treatment for tick bites. The largest number of such cases were registered in the Rostov-on-Don, Volgodonsk, Taganrog, Salsk, Peschanokopsk, Semikarakorsk, Tselinsky and Salsk areas.

The natural foci of [the ticks responsible for transmission of] CCHF virus infection include steppe, semi-desert, and forest-steppe landscapes of the south of Russia: including Kalmykia, Dagestan, Ingushetia, Karachaevo-Cherkessia and Kabardino-Balkaria, Krasnodar, Stavropol , Rostov, Volgograd, and Astrakhan regions.
