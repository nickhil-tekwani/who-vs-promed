More than 100 children were hospitalized because of a salmonella
outbreak at a Black Sea summer camp in Romania, the Health Ministry
said Wednesday [11 Jul 2007]. The ministry ordered the closure of the
camp, Romania's largest. More than 1000 children were staying at the
camp in Navodari.
Health authorities reported that 103 children were stricken with
salmonellosis along with 6 camp employees. Health inspectors found
the bacteria in several places in the canteen, including in the
kitchen and on the tables where the meals were being served.
Health Minister, Eugen Nicolaescu, said all those hospitalized were
in good condition. The children started being hospitalized on Sun 8 Jul 2007.
Education Minister, Cristian Adomnitei, who visited the camp, said
all children would be sent home by chartered buses and trains.

[It is not stated in the posting, but the number of symptomatic
children in the summer camp may have been much higher than the 103
that were ill enough to be hospitalized.
The direct source of the outbreak is not likely to be the
environmental sites mentioned since the inoculum to produce infection
is quite large requiring replication of the offending microorganism
in, usually, a contaminated food source. The contamination could have
been primary such as in chicken or eggs (which were then not
adequately cooked or cross-contaminated after cooking) or secondary
to cross-contamination from another food source or a food worker. It
is not stated if any of the camp employees were involved in food preparation.
Navodari is located in Constanta county in extreme eastern Romania
bordering on the Black Sea. The county can be found on a map of the country at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constan%C5%A3a_County>. The name of the
town means "trawlers" in Romanian, indicating that it was originally
a fishing village. The camp is mentioned in Wikipedia
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C4%83vodari>): "Some 5 kilometers (3
mi) from the town itself, there is a summer camp (the largest one in
Romania), built under the communist regime for school children. Due
to its interesting programs, good accommodation, and acceptable
prices, it was extremely popular among teachers and parents." - Mod.LL]
