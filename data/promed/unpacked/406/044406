Forms of _Aedes aegypti_ and possible other dengue vectors in Yemen
--------------------------------------------------
As deduced by the Moderator in his authoritative description of dengue
vectors, _Ae. (Stegomyia) aegypti_ is the 1st suspect, but I would like to
add a word of -- admittedly partisan -- caution. The Ethiopian/Afrotropical
faunistic region extends into Yemen and southwestern Saudi Arabia, most
recently illustrated rather vividly with the population explosion of the
pan-African subspecies _arabiensis_ of the species _Aedes (Aedimorphus)
vexans_, which led to the 2000 Rift Valley fever epidemic in the Arabian
Peninsula.
The vectors of dengue in Africa include the presumed ancestral subspecies
of the cosmotropical _Ae. aegypti_, which breeds predominantly in
phytotelmata (water collections in plants) in rural and sylvatic zones, as
well as the subspecies described in the editorial comments as breeding in
artificial containers (_Ae. aegypti formosus_ and _Ae. aegypti aegypti_).
_Ae. (Stegomyia) unilineatus_, another Afro-Asian tree-hole breeding
species not known as a dengue vector (we simply don't know whether it is a
competent vector or not), was recently reported from the Asir and Jizan
regions of Saudi Arabia (Godsey et al., 2003, JAMCA 19:84), presumably
breeding in the leaf axils of palms, as trees are in such short supply. Who
knows what else is breeding in this type of habitat? Who knows whether
there are other potential or actual vectors breeding in other 'container'
habitats, such as rock pools or water troughs? Perhaps _Ae. albopictus_
does not occur in the region, perhaps it does. Bluntly put, if one doesn't
look for it, one doesn't find it.
For these reasons, I would suggest that a rapid entomological investigation
of all possible mosquito breeding sites -- not merely CO2-baited light trap
sampling but larval/pupal sampling -- about foci of dengue virus
transmission may be prudent prior to launching future vector control
efforts in the region.

[It is generally agreed that _Aedes aegypti_ originated in Africa and
spread to much of the tropical world. It is true that a black (dark) form
of adults called _Ae. aegypti formosus_ breeds in natural container
habitats (e.g. tree-holes) in mainly forested areas away from human
habitations in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. It rarely bites humans. This
form is essentially confined to Africa although it has been transported to
a few islands. However, it is the browner and lighter form _Ae. aegypti_
sensu stricto (_Ae. aegypti aegypti_ ) that is the main vector of dengue,
whether in Africa or in other parts of the world. This is the species that
colonises man-made container habitats such as water-storage pots and
consequently has close contact with humans and is highly anthropophagic.
However, the issue is not that simple, as these 2 forms may very
occasionally interbreed and give rise to adults showing differing degrees
of paleness. Moreover, in East Africa there is evidence that the dark form
(ssp. _formosus_) has become peridomestic and breeds in man-made containers
and footholds cut in coconut palms.
But basically when _Ae. aegypti_ is cited as a dengue vector it refers to
the paler form.
The mosquito fauna of Yemen, like most Middle Eastern countries, contains
species found in sub-Saharan Africa (e.g. _Anopheles arabiensis_, _Culex
decens_), Asia ( e.g. _An. culicifacies_, _An. sergentii_) and Europe (
_Ochlerototatus caspius_).
As Alan Kemp says, there may be other vectors of dengue in Yemen, but I
would still bet that any transmission involves _Ae. aegypti_ - Mod.MS]
