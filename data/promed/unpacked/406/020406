The number of patients in England carrying antibiotic-resistant bacteria has soared. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases of a strain of gut bacteria that can destroy antibiotics has risen from just 5 in 2006, to more than 600 in 2013.

Health officials have said that the increase in cases has shown the 'urgent need' for hospitals to implement plans and procedures to stem the spread of antibiotic resistance. Public Health England (PHE) has launched a new toolkit for hospitals to help them control antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE).

This is the name given to some strains of gut bacteria that can be resistant to carbapenem antibiotics. Carbapenems are considered to be 'last resort' antibiotics, which medics use to treat difficult infections when other antibiotics would or have failed, PHE said. While infections caused by CPE can still be treated with other antibiotics, treatment may be more difficult, a spokesman said. He added that in the last decade there has been a 'sustained' increase in the number of CPE cases.

About 2/3rds of trusts in England have had between 1 and 20 patients identified with CPE carriage or infection over the past 5 years. This includes 2 trusts in Manchester that have had more than 100 patients identified with CPE.

PHE's medical director Dr Paul Cosford said: "In order to minimise the wide spread of these multi-drug resistant infections across England it is essential that all trusts are aware of this toolkit. They must also develop plans for detecting and managing patients with infections caused by CPE and other antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These infections are already causing national concern due to the observed increasing trends in the number of infections, outbreaks and clusters across England. We now have a window of opportunity, if we act quickly and decisively, to address this very real public health threat and prevent widespread problems by minimising the negative impact of these organisms."

England's chief medical officer Professor Dame Sally Davies said: "Antibiotic resistance poses a real threat to our ability to treat diseases. Although there has been an increase in this strain of bacteria, the new toolkit will ensure that hospitals are well placed to detect, manage and control any cases. Systems of monitoring for resistant bacteria are essential in safeguarding the effect of our antibiotics."

Health experts have previously warned of the 'catastrophic threat' of people becoming resistant to antibiotics, saying that in just 20 years' time routine operations could become deadly if we lose the ability to fight infection. Last year [2013], Dame Sally said that resistance to antibiotics is one of the greatest threats to modern health. She said many of the drugs are being used unnecessarily for mild infections or illnesses that should not be treated with antibiotics -- helping to create resistance.

[The above news report fails to tell us which bacteria and which type of carbapenemase they are referring to. "Gut bacteria" referred to in the article are likely Enterobacteriaceae, which is a large family of Gram-negative bacteria that includes _Escherichia coli_, _Salmonella_, _Shigella_, _Yersinia pestis_, _Klebsiella_, _Proteus_, _Enterobacter_, _Serratia_, and _Citrobacter_, some of which live in the intestines of humans and other animals.

The following has been extracted from moderator ML's comments in a prior ProMED-mail post, Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem resistant - Europe: survey 20130712.1822582:

Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that includes ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive, but otherwise multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacilli, such as those that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or AmpC beta-lactamases, which are enzymes that destroy most beta-lactams, except for the carbapenems.

Resistance to carbapenems is commonly the result of an organism acquiring the ability to produce carbapenemases, enzymes that destroy the carbapenems. There are several distinct types of carbapenemase: KPCs (_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases); NDM (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase); IMP; VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase); and OXA-types (oxacillin-hydrolyzing carbapenemases). KPCs are the most common carbapenemases in the US, but have also been reported worldwide.

Many of the carbapenemases are encoded on plasmids and other mobile genetic elements, pieces of DNA that can easily spread from one organism to another of the same or even different bacterial species. These mobile pieces of DNA frequently carry genes that confer resistance to multiple other classes of antibiotics, so that these organisms have been susceptible only to toxic or otherwise suboptimal antibiotics.

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) can colonize the gastrointestinal systems of humans for prolonged periods and once introduced can spread through contamination of water sources, hands of health care personnel, and environmental surfaces (for example, bed rails, IV poles, computer touchpads, and equipment used to monitor vital signs such as stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs, etc.) within health care facilities (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6124a3.htm?s_cid=mm6124a3_e).

Infection control interventions in healthcare facilities aimed at preventing transmission of these multi-drug resistant isolates include their rapid recognition by the microbiology laboratory when cultured from clinical specimens, placement of patients colonized or infected with these isolates on contact precautions, and in some circumstances, conducting point prevalence surveys or active-surveillance cultures of high-risk patients and their environment (CDC, Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee. Management of multidrug-resistant organisms in healthcare settings, 2006. Atlanta, GA: US Department of Health and Human Services, CDC, Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee; 2007. Available at http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/MDROGuideline2006.pdf). Active case detection may be followed by cohorting staff and CRE patients (i.e., segregating CRE-colonized or CRE-infected patients and the health-care personnel who care for them from those without CRE and the health-care personnel who care for them) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm62e0305a1.htm?s_cid=mm62e0305a1_w).

A recent study (1) reported overall, KPC-positive Enterobacteriaceae have the widest distribution among carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Europe, but rising numbers of OXA-48-positive isolates are reported, making OXA-48 the most frequently detected carbapenemase in Belgium, France and Malta. Despite the attention that NDM has received when associated with introductions from the Indian subcontinent, the current numbers of reports by European countries are still relatively modest compared to the other carbapenemases. The United Kingdom, however, continues to report more NDM-positive isolates than most other European countries.
