A report by the National Leptospirosis Reference Centre (NLRC) at Port Blair has revealed that most of the cattle samples from Mumbai have tested positive for _Leptospira_.

Following reports of a surge in leptospirosis cases, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's (BMC's) health department had collected some blood and urine samples of cattle and sent them to the NLRC, which studied the strain of leptospirosis circulating in the city. The bacterial infection has returned this year and claimed one life in July [2016].

"With the help of veterinary experts, we had collected random blood samples of dogs, cows, buffaloes and cats from the city. They were sent to the laboratory for testing. The test reports, which we received a few days ago, have been startling. Most of the cattle samples tested positive for leptospira bacteria. The results show that we have to take strict action to prevent the disease," said Dr Padmaja Keskar, the executive health officer of the BMC.

Transmission of the leptospira bacteria occurs from animals to humans. Initial clinical signs include highly-coloured urine, fever and complete body ache, which exacerbates into jaundice, a drop in platelets and, later, possible kidney failure, doctors said. Leptospirosis is considered to be a curable and non-fatal disease when treated within 3 days of the development of symptoms.

"We have asked pet owners to vaccinate their pets. We have also informed them that since the leptospirosis infection spreads through contaminated urine from an infected animal, care should be taken," said a BMC official.

According to the BMC's health report, more than 15 people have tested positive for leptospirosis in the past one week.

Dr Om Srivastava, the head of the infectious diseases department at Jaslok Hospital, said: "Avoid self-medication, and avoid walking in stagnant water. Kids should be careful, as they like to play in water. The disease is easy to cure if treatment begins within the 1st 3 days, while a delay in getting medical aid has definitely proved fatal for patients."
