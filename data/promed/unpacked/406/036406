The 1st case of the mosquito-borne disease "chikungunya" was confirmed in
French Guiana, local health authorities said on Wednesday.
Results are due on Thursday of tests carried out on a 2nd person, who also
displayed symptoms of the painful disease for which there is no cure or
vaccine.
"It concerns 2 sisters who went to Madagascar for family reasons," medical
inspector Francoise Ravanchol told a news conference.
The 2 women had visited a town in the east of Madagascar which has been
affected by dengue fever and where 2 cases of chikungunya have been recorded,
she added.
The mosquito which transmits dengue fever can also transmit chikungunya,
according to the Pasteur Institute in Cayenne [capital of French Guiana],
which confirmed the case of chikungunya.
French Guiana is [currently] affected by its worst outbreak of dengue since
the beginning of the 1990s.
Chikungunya fever has infected more than 180 000 people, mostly in Reunion but
also in Mauritius, Seychelles, Mayotte & Madagascar, all located off the
southeast coast of Africa.
The tropical virus, first recognised in Tanzania in 1952, is marked by high
fever and severe rashes and can be extremely painful, leaving its victims in a
stooped posture. Symptoms can last from 7 days to a few months.

[With dengue having been endemic in French Guyana since the 1990s, the advent
of the 1st confirmed case of chikungunya -- and another travel companion
suspected of the same infection, pending test results -- will keep the local
health authorities vigilant. Simultaneous outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya
are currently still rampant in Madagascar and other smaller islands in the
Indian Ocean off the eastern African coast. Insect control is the only proven
efficient measure to counteract the spread of mosquito-transmitted diseases.
This can be achieved through public awareness campaigns and fogging with
insecticide by local government.
