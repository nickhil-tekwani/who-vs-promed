3 die in Crimean-Congo fever strikes in Black Sea Coast province
----------------------------------------------------------------
KASTAMONU: 3 people have died in the Black Sea province of Kastamonu due to Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, a tick-borne viral disease, the governor of the province said yesterday (Thu 17 May 2012] in a joint press conference with other local officials; 7 people in 5 different provinces have died of the disease in the last 2 weeks following tick bites, and dozens of others have been discharged after receiving treatment at hospitals.

“This tick-borne curse has once more become an issue along with the warming weather. The viral Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has again reared its head. We have lost 3 [people] due to [this illness] as of today. We have quite a large number of patients receiving treatment for the disease. Some have been discharged, while others are still under treatment due to a positive diagnosis,” Kastamonu Gov. Erdoğan Bektaş said. “It is spring, and our citizens are going outside [more]. Therefore we need to caution our citizens. This is no joke: Death is the price that is on the line. We have lost 3 citizens. Taking the [necessary] precautions is not difficult,” Bektaş said. 7 patients have already been treated and discharged from hospital as of now, Dr. Yılmaz said, adding that the disease does not have to be fatal if the tick bite can be detected early on and the victim taken to hospital in short order. “Turkey first saw Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in 2002. This is an undesirable situation that could [arise] across the whole of Turkey, although it is more prevalent in certain areas,” Dr. Yılmaz said.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever mainly affects animals. Ticks that live on sheep and cattle can sometimes pass the virus on to people. It is an Ebola-like [i.e. haemorrhagic] fever and patients can bleed to death if they are not treated quickly. [Ebola virus and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus are not related viruses. - Mod.CP], Those infected can transmit the virus through their blood or saliva. The disease is endemic in parts of Africa, Asia and Europe.

[The vector of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is the tick _Hyalomma marginatum_ which is present throughout Asia, Southern Europe and Africa. Some records from North western Europe relate to immature stages traveling on birds. This species has two hosts and the tick's life cycle lasts 14 weeks (minimum) from egg to adult. Adults target domestic animals: sheep, cattle, dogs, deer, camels, horses, whereas the nymphs and larvae target small wild mammals, lizards and birds. Humans are mostly attacked by the adult stage.

Education of the population to recognise and promptly remove these ticks will be the most relevant strategy for control of CCFV infection in Turkey. Images of the tick vector can be viewed at: http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=hyalomma+marginatum&hl=en&prmd=imvns&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=n3i3T4z4MYXU8QOWsvnJCg&sqi=2&ved=0CFUQsAQ&biw=1008&bih=404.

The increasing CCHF mortality currently being reported in the Black Sea and Anatolian regions of Turkey may be indicative of an increasing abundance of the tick vector, or a lack of appreciation of the hazards associated with tick-bites.
