[excerpts]

Travel cases, disease spread in Morocco
---------------------------------------
[T]he scope of the [Ebola virus disease] outbreak continued to expand, with the detection of a travel-linked case in Morocco. [According to a 1 Aug 2014 AllAfrica report, Morocco's Minister of Internal Affairs, Mr Morris Dukuly] on 30 Jul 2014 said a Liberian citizen has died from EVD in Morocco. The patient had left Liberia 2 days before he died. The report did not include any details about the man's flight or contact tracing of airline passengers, airline staff, or health workers who may have had contact with the man. [Neither are there any details of which lab made the confirmation. - Mod.JW]

[2] Nigeria: call for clinicians
Date: Tue 5 Aug 2014

This is URGENT
--------------
Graduates and residents NFELTP [Nigeria Field Epidemiology & Lab Training Program:
As you all know we have 2 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease and a few suspect/probable cases under investigation. The FELTP has been substantially involved in supporting epidemiology work (contact tracing, surveillance, training, etc) since 23 Jul 2014.

Adequate and complete contact tracing and immediate isolation of cases is the only way to interrupt transmission. We need to support the response with clinicians who can support case management.

If you are a clinician and you are willing to support the case management team please give me a call on 07034119819 or Chinyere on 08188123311 as soon as possible.

If you know a clinician willing to help give us a call too. PPE, adequate training and other supportive requirements will be provided for any clinicians willing to support case management. This is urgent.

Ebola virus disease update -- West Africa
-----------------------------------------
As of 1 Aug 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the 4 countries stands at 1603 including 887 deaths.

The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows:
- Guinea, 485 cases (340 confirmed, 133 probable, and 12 suspected) including 358 deaths;
- Liberia, 468 cases (129 confirmed, 234 probable, and 105 suspected) including 255 deaths;
- Nigeria, 4 cases (0 confirmed, 3 probable, 1 suspected) including 1 death;
- Sierra Leone, 646 cases (540 confirmed, 46 probable, and 60 suspected) including 273 deaths.

Between 31 Jul-1 Aug 2014, 163 new cases (laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases) of EVD [including] 61 deaths were reported from the 4 countries as follows:
- Guinea, 13 new cases [including] 12 deaths;
- Liberia, 77 new cases [including] 28 deaths;
- Sierra Leone, 72 new cases [including] 21 deaths;
- Nigeria, 2 new probable cases -- one is a health-care worker and one is a Nigerian who travelled to Guinea -- and a suspected case in a nurse.

Human and financial resource mobilization continues to be sought from WHO's partners, UN agencies, and other stakeholders. On Friday [1 Aug 2014], WHO and the affected countries issued the Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak Response Plan in West Africa covering Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, neighbouring states, and other countries in the region from July-December 2014 (http://who.int/csr/disease/ebola/outbreak-response-plan/en).

The joint WHO-tri-national plan, estimated at USD 100.5 million (funding gap is USD 71 million) calls for additional human and material resources that align with the measures in the Joint Declaration.

Disease update
--------------
[A table showing confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone is available at the source URL above.]

The total number of cases is subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data, and enhanced surveillance. Data reported in the Disease Outbreak News are based on best available information reported by Ministries of Health.

* Note to the media: On 31 Jul 2014, a Disease Outbreak News (DON) was posted to the WHO corporate website reporting EVD figures for the period covering 24-27 Jul 2014. On the same date, a DON was posted to the website for the WHO Regional Office of Africa reporting EVD figures for the period covering 28-30 Jul 2014. Today's [4 Aug 2014] DON reflects data for the period covering 31 Jul-1 Aug 2014.

[163 new cases in 24 hours -- the disaster is accelerating -- or maybe it's just the case finding and epidemiological surveillance that are getting better.

More volunteers are urgently needed in the field, not only in Nigeria. - Mod.JW
