Sierra Leone anthrax outbreak update
------------------------------------
In a follow-up on the anthrax outbreak in Sierra Leone, as of [17 Jun 2022], a total of 6 anthrax cases were reported including 5 confirmed cases and one probable case. The majority of them are among the age group of 15 years and above (43%) followed by 12-59 months (29%), 0-11 months (14%), and 5-15 years (14%).

The Ministry of Health and Sanitation in Sierra Leone has declared an outbreak of human anthrax in the country after identifying 3 lab-confirmed cutaneous anthrax cases in Karene district. An investigation was conducted as follow-up to reports of sickness and death of animals in the adjacent Port Loko district between March and April [2022], with reported consumption of meat in surrounding communities.

Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria known as _Bacillus anthracis_. Anthrax can be found naturally in soil and commonly affects domestic and wild animals around the world. Although it is rare, people can get sick with anthrax if they come in contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products.

Cutaneous anthrax occurs when the spore (or possibly the bacterium) enters a cut or abrasion on the skin. It starts out as a raised bump that looks like an insect bite. It then develops into a blackened lesion called an eschar that may form a scab. Lymph glands in the area may swell plus edema may be present. This form of anthrax responds well to antibiotics. If untreated, deaths can occur if the infection goes systemic. As many as 95% of cases of anthrax are cutaneous.

[For a map of Sierra Leone, go to: https://maps.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/sierra_leone_pol_2005.jpg. For Port Loko go to Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Loko_District. Karene is a district in the North West Province, Sierra Leone. Karene is one of the 16 districts that make up the Republic of Sierra Leone.

This is an update of what we knew already but it describes an extraordinary number of cases, fortunately cutaneous, in children and teenagers. Normally it is absent from these age groups, primarily because they normally have zero exposure to animals during slaughter & butchering. For some reason, this was not the case this time. The only suggestion I can make is that the older children were involved in carrying the contaminated meat home. For the infant and young children, a parent with blood-contaminated hands may have handled them. Either way, this is quite an extraordinary event and the Sierra Leone authorities, veterinary and public health, must make it very clear that children must be excluded from butchered animals and their products.
