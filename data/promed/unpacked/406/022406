Bluetongue disease
------------------
Cattle in the Jordan Valley and Western Galilee [Hazafon district,
northern Israel], sampled during 2010, have been found positive for
BTV serotype 12 according to test results obtained from the reference
laboratory at Pirbright, UK. (This serotype had not been identified
earlier in Israel).

[It will be helpful to obtain additional data in relation to the
preliminary information above:
1. What samples were taken (entire blood/serum/other)?
2. Animals sampled: age, breed, husbandry (housed/pasturing), clinical
status, origin (indigenous/imported).
3. Dates
4. Test applied

Bluetongue is regarded endemic in Israel since its initial
laboratory-confirmed identification in 1951, with clinical disease
seen almost every year. It is strictly seasonal and has been known,
until recently, to affect almost exclusively sheep (of susceptible
breeds). All clinically suspected cases are obligatorily
laboratory-confirmed. 5 serotypes have been identified in Israel
between 1951 and 1973, namely BTV-4 (1951), BTV-16 (1968), BTV-6
(1972), BTV-2 (1973), and BTV-10 (1973). BTV-4 has been, throughout
these years, the most prevalent serotype.

Then, after 32 years of a seemingly stable situation, a new strain
appeared, namely BTV-15 (2006), which affected sheep. This was
followed by the detection of 3 other newly introduced BTV strains
which -- rather surprisingly -- affected clinically cattle as well:
BTV-24 (2008), BTV-8 (2008, eventually identified early 2009), and
BTV-5 (2009). In case the identification of BTV-12 is confirmed, this
will become Israel's 10th BTV serotype.

According to BTV data from the Institute for Animal Health (IAH),
Pirbright, BTV-12 distribution is the following:
Isolated: Africa, Southeast Asia and Indonesia, China, Central and
South America.
Suspected: Middle East, Pakistan+India, Australia.
(http://www.reoviridae.org/dsrna_virus_proteins//btv-serotype-distribution.htm).

BT disease (and activity of the vector) is typically seasonal
(July-January) in Israel, mostly peaking in October-November;
information on the current year's situation is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
