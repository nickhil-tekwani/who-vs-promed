A banned pesticide used in a neighbouring apartment caused the death of a 10 year old boy in Al Nahda, the Sharjah police have said. The family of Pakistani boy, who died on Friday [24 May 2019], is struggling through legal clearance to get his body released. His father said they would bury the boy in the UAE since they could not leave his twin sister alone at the hospital. "It's been 4 days, and we want to bury our boy. We have to do it here since his sister is still in serious condition."

Lt-Col Saeed Al Shamsi, head of the investigation team at Al Buhairah Police Station, said a team comprising officers from the forensic department and the Sharjah Municipality rushed to the building and found out the toxic gas had emanated from a neighbouring apartment. The team broke open the door of the apartment, where the occupant had left the country for vacation after spraying pesticide and locking its door.

According to sources, the pesticide used in the apartment is aluminum phosphide, which is banned in residential areas.

The girl's heart has been affected after inhaling the poisonous gas, and she is currently in the ICU of Al Qasimi Hospital. "We want her transferred to Al Jalila Hospital in Dubai, but there are some complications," he [who? Father? - Mod.SH] said.

On 23 May 2019, the father fell ill in the afternoon and had to break his fast. "By evening, my son also felt ill. He was dizzy and felt nauseous, so we both went to the hospital where he was given a drip," he said. Later at night, his wife and daughter also felt some uneasiness. "I left my son at home since he had been to hospital, and we 3 went to the hospital," he said. "Upon our return at 5am, I found KH had vomited, and I gave him a glass of water and put him to bed," said the bereaved father.

By 7am, the family was up again after feeling uneasy. "[The boy] then came running into our room and said, "Mum, Dad" and then fell unconscious," he said. By the time the ambulance came, the boy had already passed away. The family was taken to hospital and stayed in the ICU. Though [the parents] were discharged on Sunday [26 May 2019], the daughter is still under observation. Her father said that there were no fumes or smell that could alert them to the dangerous gas they were breathing in. "Authorities thought it was food poisoning," he said.

His wife is heartbroken over the loss of her only son, who was born and brought up in Sharjah. The kids studied at School of Knowledge in Sharjah. The girl's condition stable.

Dr Safia Al Khaja, director of gynaecology and the children's department at Al Qasimi Hospital, told Khaleej Times that the child arrived at the hospital dead, while the girl was in a severe state of fatigue and suffered from a severe drop in the function of her heart and vital organs and with difficulties in breathing. The doctor added that the medical staff did necessary procedures and admitted the girl to the ICU. Her health condition is currently stable, but it will take several days for her to leave the hospital. "When patients arrive in the hospital with symptoms of vomiting and severe fatigue, it is very difficult to distinguish initially between food poisoning or inhalation of banned substances due to similarities in symptoms," said Dr Al Khaja.

An official at the Sharjah Municipality said that following a number of deaths and illnesses caused by the use of illegal pesticides in previous years, the civic body has taken stringent measures to regulate the operation of pest control companies. Intensified crackdowns by the municipality had resulted in reduction of illegal companies by more than 50 per cent, he added. "The municipality has provided license for 62 pest control companies to operate in the emirate. Major crackdowns were conducted by the civic body on illegal companies using their contact details on the flyers and media advertisements. The pest control companies have also been asked to hire professional and experienced personnel. They are also expected to have their offices and warehouses away from the city."

He said pest control companies are banned from using sprays inside homes unless they get prior approval. In a recent meeting held by the department, the pest control companies operating in the emirate were given a list of the authorised pesticides which can be used. The companies are not allowed to use chemicals that have not been tested and approved by the municipality. However, according to the official, the illegal companies are bypassing the regulations by selling illegal pesticide online. "Unfortunately, many people buy the pesticide online or through social media platforms without knowing its risk or danger, and they use it on their own without referring to the civic body or hiring an approved company. In this case, it seems the Egyptian owner of the flat sprayed the pesticide and went on vacation to his home country."

The official said the municipality will continue an awareness campaign to alert customers to the danger of buying pesticide online. The municipality has recently carried out awareness campaigns on the danger of hiring illegal companies and use of banned substances. The pest control section has put up stickers in buildings in Arabic, English and Urdu and educated watchmen to not allow unauthorised companies to provide services to the tenants.

["Aluminum phosphide (AlP -- Al is for aluminum and P is for phosphide) is a highly toxic, low cost, effective, and commonly used pesticide, a fumigant for control of insects and rodents. It is primarily used for indoor fumigation of raw agricultural commodities, animal feeds, processed food commodities, and non-food commodities in sealed containers or structures, and for outdoor fumigation of burrows to control rodents and moles in non-domestic areas, non-cropland, and agricultural areas.

"Aluminum and magnesium phosphide are formulated as tablets, pellets, impregnated materials and dusts. Aluminum and magnesium phosphide are restricted use chemicals. The use by certified pesticide applicators (at least in the USA) with respect to rodent control for burrows at least 15 feet (4.6 m) from a residential structure is considered a residential use.

"Aluminum and magnesium phosphide react with moisture in the atmosphere to produce phosphine gas, which is the substance that is active as a pesticide. It liberates lethal phosphine gas when it comes in contact either with atmospheric moisture or with hydrochloric acid in the stomach. The release of phosphine gas from AlP is immediate when mixed with aqueous solutions, such as water, and leads to rapid absorption through the lungs and gut when swallowed. Its gaseous form and toxicity make it a potential agent for chemical terrorism.

"Unfortunately, AlP is now one of the most common causes of pesticide poisoning among agricultural workers.

"The mechanism of toxicity includes cellular hypoxia due to the effect on mitochondria, inhibition of cytochrome C oxidase, and formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. The signs and symptoms are nonspecific and instantaneous.

"The toxicity of AlP particularly affects the cardiac and vascular tissues, which manifest as profound and refractory hypotension, congestive heart failure, and electrocardiographic abnormalities. The diagnosis of AlP usually depends on clinical suspicion or history but can be made easily by the simple silver nitrate test on gastric content or on breath. Due to no known specific antidote, management remains primarily supportive care.

"Aluminum and magnesium phosphide are in Toxicity Category I, the highest (most toxic) of 4 categories, for acute effects via the inhalation route. No significant exposure to phosphine gas is expected via dermal routes, although rarely dermal absorption has been the route of lethal exposures. The Environmental Protection Agency does not believe that aluminum and magnesium phosphide pose a carcinogenic concern.

"Histopathological findings of vital organs were found to be suggestive of cellular hypoxia. Myocardial muscles in non-survivors showed myocyte vacuolation, areas of myocytolysis and degeneration. Histological changes on human brain showed disorganisation of the different layers, paucity of glial cells, degeneration of neurons, and appearance of necrotic patches. In other organs like in lung, diffuse vessel injury with edema and atelectasis; in liver, centrilobular necrosis; and in kidney, tubular degeneration findings may be present.

"The permissible exposure limit of phosphine is less than 0.3 ppm in the working environment and levels greater than 50 ppm are dangerous to life, while at 400-600 ppm it is lethal within half an hour. Individuals working in the manufacturing facility of AlP or methamphetamine (phosphine is a by-product), engaged in placing AlP tablets on the stacks of grains, and in the vicinity of application are at risk for unintentional exposure of phosphine gas, with few reported fatalities.

"Cases have existed in animals fed grain that was exposed to phosphine tablets but not allowed to sit for long enough prior to being fed to the animals. Animals have died in all of these cases."

This is a sad situation, but it may indicate that the plant needs more attention to safety. We sincerely hope the workers recover.
