viruses and virus-like pathogens in the Solomon Islands. Australasian
Plant Pathology 2009, 38(2): 193-201; DOI: 10.1071/AP08083]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Surveys for virus and virus-like plant diseases were conducted on the
islands of Guadalcanal, Malaita, Ndende [Santa Cruz group], and Temon
Neo [near Ndende] in the Solomon Islands.

New plant virus records for the country were those of _Zucchini
yellow mosaic virus_ (ZYMV) in _Citrulus lanatus_ (watermelon),
_Cucurbita maxima_ (pumpkin), _Cucumis melo_ (rockmelon) and _Cucumis
sativus_ (cucumber); _Turnip mosaic virus_ (TuMV) in _Brassica
chinensis_ (Chinese cabbage); _Tomato mosaic virus_ (ToMV) in
_Capsicum annuum_ var. _annuum_ (chilli) and _Solanum lycopersicum_
(tomato); and _Tobacco mosaic virus_ (TMV) in _S. lycopersicum_, all
detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

New virus host records, detected by ELISA, were those of the
cucurbit- infecting strain of _Papaya ringspot virus_ (PRSV-W) in _C.
maxima_ and _C. sativus_; _Bean common mosaic virus_ (BCMV) in _Vigna
unguiculata_ ssp. _unguiculata_ (snakebean) and _Passiflora foetida_
[passionflower]; and _Cucumber mosaic virus_ (CMV) in _Ruellia
prostrata_ ['wild petunia'], _Synedrella nodiflora_ ['Cinderella
weed'] and _Nicotiana tabaccum_ (tobacco).

Other detections using ELISA were those of CMV in _C. annuum_ var.
_annuum_ and _S. lycopersicum_.

Phytoplasmas belonging to the _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma aurantifolia
(16SrII) group were detected by nested PCR in _Celosia argentea_
[ornamental cockscomb], and _B. chinensis_.

No evidence was found for presence of citrus huanglongbing,
previously known as greening disease. Seven citrus trees indexed
negative by PCR for the causal agent, _Candidatus_ Liberibacter
asiaticus.

[The viruses mentioned above can affect important crops and cause
yield losses in a range of mainly vegetable hosts.

_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma aurantifolia (16SrII taxonomic group) causes
witches broom disease of lime (WBDL; see ProMED-mail post no.
20090128.0378) and the group includes a number of other members
affecting important crops, for example tomato, capsicum, peanut,
potato, beans, chickpea, and lettuce. Further work appears to be
needed to determine the exact identity of the phytoplasma(s) in
Solomon Islands.

Huanglongbing (HLB), or citrus greening, is one of the most damaging
diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruits. For more
information see ProMED-mail post no. 20080829.2707 and links below.

Surveys of this kind are extremely difficult to conduct due to the
remoteness of locations and limited resources available. The results
reported above are valuable information for managing the country's
agriculture and international biosecurity issues. They also add
important data to the knowledge of the pathogens in general, such as
the new host records listed for some of the viruses and new
information on epidemiology and distribution of the pathogens.
