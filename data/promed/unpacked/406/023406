CDC Advisory on Interstate Transportation of Certain Human Pathogens
=====================================================================

There is increasing concern that biological agents may be used as
weapons of mass destruction by terrorists. A recent case in Ohio
involving the shipment of bubonic plague to a suspicious purchaser has
resulted in a congressional hearing to examine concerns surrounding
the interstate shipment of human pathogens. The ASM is working in
collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) and wishes to bring to the attention of all ASM members the
following CDC advisory.

Carol Nacy, Ph.D.
President, ASM

Kenneth I. Berns, M.D., Ph.D.
President Elect, ASM

Gail H. Cassell, Ph.D.
Chair, ASM Public and Scientific Affairs Board

The following letter was sent to the ASM on March 11, 1996 from David
Satcher, M.D., Ph.D., Director, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention:

In recent years, the threat of terrorist activity involving the use of
biological agents has raised increasing concern from the perspective
of both public health and national security. Accordingly the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has serious concerns about
the illicit use and the interstate transportation of certain human
pathogens that could have adverse consequences for human health and
safety.

To immediately address this issue, CDC requests that all those who
authorize the acquisition and transfer of dangerous human infectious
agents, increase their vigilance to minimize the risk of illicit
access to infectious agents by:

1) reviewing all requests prior to transferring pathogens and
toxins, particularly any request regarding the agents of causing
anthrax, botulism, brucellosis, plague, Q-fever, tularemia, and
any agents classified for work at Biosafety Level 4;

2) determining whether agents will be used for legitimate medical
or scientific purposes; and

3) immediately reporting any suspicious inquiries or transactions
to CDC's Office of Health and Safety, at 404-639-3235 (night and
weekends, call the CDC Duty Officer at 404-639-2888).

These voluntary safeguards are a first step toward strengthening
regulatory and statutory protections. CDC co-chairs a Federal
interdepartmental working group that is developing a framework for
controlling the acquisition and transfer of infectious agents. This
framework will include safeguards to control access to microbial
agents of particular concern while ensuring that researchers and
others who have a legitimate scientific need for these agents have
appropriate access to them. This approach will require close
collaboration among researchers, their institutional biosafety
officials and committees, and providers of these agents.

CDC will soon be proposing new regulations regarding acquisition and
transfer of certain biological agents. The regulations will be
developed with input from professional associations, the research
community, law enforcement authorities, and concerned members of the
public. A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking will be published in the
Federal Register for public review and comment in approximately 120
days. In addition, the Department of Justice is working to strengthen
relevant criminal statutes to enable prosecution of those who attempt
to gain illicit access to these agents.

Please ensure that this letter is widely distributed to your
membership to inform them of these procedures. We will keep you
informed of progress in addressing this critical public health and
national security issue. We appreciate your support in ensuring that
your membership follows these recommendations.
