Public health officials in North Bay say there are 146 suspected _E.
coli_ cases in the city, 24 of which have been confirmed by
laboratories. Included in that total are cases being investigated by
6 other Ontario health units, including Toronto.

"At this time, we believe the outbreak is localized to Harvey's
Restaurant on Algonquin Avenue in North Bay," the North Bay Parry
Sound Health Unit said Saturday [18 Oct 2008] in a news release. That
restaurant is currently closed. As of Friday [17 Oct 2008], 131 cases
had been reported.

"In the emergency department, they noticed it was slowing down, and
even slower today," said medical officer of health Dr. Catherine
Whiting on Saturday [18 Oct 2008]. "I think we're on the other side
of the epidemic curve." The specific bacteria involved in this
outbreak is _E. coli_ O157:H7.

[It remains tempting to think that other branches of the same
fast-food chain may harbor the same vehicle, still not elucidated,
since there are cases in other areas of Ontario. The North Bay
restaurant is located at the crossing of several large highways,
however, which can explain the observation. - Mod.LL]
