Even as the Bhopal-based High Security Diseases Laboratory confirmed the death
of one cow due to anthrax at Dedakiyali village in Mendarda [in Gujarat], at
least 13 more cows are suspected to have died of the deadly disease in the
village during the last 3 months. District officials reacted only after the
viscera of the cow that died about 10 days ago was confirmed positive by the
Bhopal laboratory, villagers told UNI today.
At least 13 more cattle are suspected to have died of the disease with
symptoms similar to anthrax in the last 3 months.
Meanwhile, ... the first lot of anthrax vaccine had arrived from Bangalore ...
and 175 cattle were vaccinated today. There are about 540 cattle in the
village and [those] remaining would be vaccinated tomorrow.
Earlier reports had said the one confirmed death due to anthrax and 10 other
suspected cases had prompted the district administration to declare the area
as anthrax-hit and to ask the people to help officials in combat operations.

[Anthrax is not frequent in western India but not unknown. As you can see from
our past postings -- refs. below -- it is most common in the south and through
the eastern states. One can only hope that the formal declaration of anthrax
will result in herd re-vaccinations during the next 2-3 years. With a possible
14 cases and official reaction only with the last, one can assume that there
has been a probable significant environmental contamination. Repeat
vaccinations will prevent new cases in the next few years: a cheap way to
control what can be a very expensive disease to the livestock owner.
In November 2005 we had a report -- see ref. below -- of undiagnosed deaths in
a Gujarat village involving 171 cattle, 3 camels, 4 buffaloes, and an
undisclosed number of 'stray' dogs after eating the dead cattle. We never
received clarification on the cause of that outbreak. - Mod.MHJ]
