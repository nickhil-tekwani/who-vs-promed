A new confirmed case of the novel coronavirus recorded in Asir. One case recovered in Hafr Al-Batin
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Within the epidemiological surveillance of the novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Ministry of Health (MOH) announces that a new confirmed case of this virus has been recorded in a 66-year-old Saudi male in Asir, but his health status is stable.

Furthermore, MOH announces that a female resident of the health practitioners, who had been previously announced to be infected with this virus in Hafr Al-Batin, has recovered.

It is worth mentioning that the MOH has tested 103 samples from various regions since the last statement and all of them have been negative except the cases that have been published.

[The addition of this newly reported case of MERS-CoV infection will raise the global total of cases to 81, including 44 deaths. In Saudi Arabia there have been 66 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 38 deaths. It appears as though sporadic cases are continuing to occur around the country.

Asir (or Aseer) is a province located in the southwest of Saudi Arabia, sharing a sort border with Yemen. For the map showing locations within Saudi Arabia that have confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection (including Asir), see http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/HealthAwareness/Corona/Pages/AboutCorona.aspx. - Mod.MPP]

MERS-CoV summary and literature update as of 9 Jul 2013
-------------------------------------------------------
Since April 2012, 80 [now 81 -- see above]laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported to WHO. 45 [sic] of the confirmed cases have died (56 percent). 49 of 75 cases (65 percent) for which the sex is known were male and the median age of the cases with known age is 51 years (range, 14 months to 94 years). Affected countries in the Middle East include Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE); in Europe countries affected include France, Germany, the United Kingdom (UK) and Italy; and in North Africa, Tunisia. No new countries have reported MERS-CoV cases since the last update. All the European and North African cases have had a direct or indirect connection to the Middle East. However, in France, Italy, Tunisia, and UK, there has been limited local transmission among close contacts that had not been to the Middle East.

Since the last update [update 8: summary and literature update as of 20 Jun 2013], 16 new laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV were reported by Saudi Arabia. 8 of the new cases were reported to be asymptomatic. Of the 8 asymptomatic cases 4 were female health care workers, 2 from the Ta'if governorate and 2 from the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The other 4 asymptomatic cases were children aged 7 to 15 years from Riyadh and the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia who had contact with confirmed cases. For further details regarding the cases see Disease Outbreak News [http://www.who.int/csr/don/archive/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/index.html].

WHO MERS-CoV related activities and upcoming guidance
-----------------------------------------------------
WHO is currently preparing travel and health advice for travellers to forthcoming mass gatherings.

Recommendations for infection prevention and control for MERS-CoV patients in hospital are under review. Advice on infection prevention for patients being cared for at home is under development.

WHO is convening an Emergency Committee meeting, as described in the International Health Regulations (2005), to review the current MERS-CoV outbreak, discuss whether the outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and advise the Director General on temporary recommendations for any necessary public health actions [the dates for the review are 9 Jul 2013 and 11 Jul 2013. Presumably conclusions of the meeting(s) will be available after conclusion of the 2 days].

WHO is also coordinating the collection of a panel of clinical serum specimens, which will include both MERS-CoV positive and negative specimens, to standardize serological assays. This activity is being done in collaboration with an international network of public health and research laboratories.

Recent guidelines
-----------------
On [5 Jul 2013], WHO published a guideline for investigation of MERS-CoV cases [http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/MERS_CoV_investigation_guideline_Jul13.pdf]. It provides recommendations for early case investigation including further case finding, surveillance enhancements, and studies that need to be done around new cases.

On [3 Jul 2013], WHO published revised case definitions for MERS-CoV confirmed and probable cases based on new epidemiological and clinical information [http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/case_definition/en/index.html]. The document also contains recommendations on further evaluation for cases with inconclusive tests and asymptomatic infections.

On [27 Jun 2013], WHO published interim surveillance recommendations for human infection with MERS-CoV. The 2 major changes include a stronger recommendation for the use of lower respiratory tract specimens in addition to nasopharyngeal swabs for diagnostic testing and a longer observation period for contacts of cases. [http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/InterimRevisedSurveillanceRecommendations_nCoVinfection_27Jun13.pdf]

Recent papers in the scientific literature
------------------------------------------
Several MERS-CoV scientific investigations have been published in journals:

- The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health provided an in-depth analysis of 25 (23 confirmed and 2 probable) MERS-CoV cases associated with an outbreak in the Al-Ahsa region of Saudi Arabia. The outbreak involved patients, their family members and health care workers from 4 different hospitals, including a haemodialysis unit, an intensive care unit and other inpatient units. Human-to-human-transmission was considered the likely source of infection for most of the cases. The estimated median incubation period was 5.2 days (95 percent confidence interval 1.9 to 14.7 days).

- German investigators published a viral load profile of a patient infected with MERS-CoV treated in Germany in March 2013. They found very high viral loads in lower respiratory tract samples from the patient compared with upper respiratory samples, and low concentrations of the virus in stool, urine and blood.

- A recent paper describes 3 possible transmission scenarios for MERS-CoV, detailing the implications for risk assessment and control for each. The scenarios include subcritical outbreaks where the reproduction number (R0) is less than 1, supercritical outbreaks where R0 is greater than 1 but the epidemic has not become self-sustaining in human populations, and a self-sustaining epidemic where R0 is greater than one. The authors stress the importance of adequate data collection in order to permit rigorous assessment of the severity and transmission characteristics of MERS-CoV.

Summary assessment
------------------
With recent reports of asymptomatic and mild cases, the proportion of confirmed cases that have died of MERS-CoV infections is lower than previously reported, as is the average age, and the proportion of patients who are female has increased. It is noteworthy that these cases have been detected as part of contact investigations around severe cases. These severe cases were discovered as a result of surveillance activities that focus on finding severely affected patients. Index cases, the 1st cases occurring in a cluster, presumably are more likely to have had a non-human exposure as their source of infection and continue to be predominantly older males, perhaps providing a clue to the exposure that resulted in their infection. Whether the relative mildness of illness in contact cases is an artifact of surveillance and case-finding activities or represents a difference in virulence between sporadic infections acquired from non-human exposures and those acquired from human-to-human transmission is unknown.

The recent mild and asymptomatic cases raise concerns about the possibility of large numbers of milder cases going undetected. While it is clear that human-to-human transmission does occur, it is not clear whether transmission is sustained in the community. The currently observed pattern of disease occurrence could be consistent either with ongoing transmission in an animal reservoir with sporadic spillover into humans resulting in non-sustained clusters, or unrecognized sustained transmission among humans with occasional severe cases. Detailed case contact investigations, increased surveillance in other countries of the region, and formal studies of non-human exposures of index cases are urgently needed to answer these questions. A new guideline for these case investigations has recently been published (see above).

The public health importance of asymptomatic cases is uncertain. More information is needed about the virus excretion patterns in persons without symptoms to understand the risk they may pose to non-infected persons. Experience from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 suggests that very little if any transmission occurred from asymptomatic individuals. In addition, in the absence of symptomatic illness, the burden of proof must be higher because of the possibility of misclassification from false positive tests that result from laboratory contamination. In most viral infections, an immunological response, such as development of specific antibodies, would be expected even with mild or asymptomatic infection; as such, serological testing may be useful as additional confirmation of the diagnosis. Additional steps to reconfirm asymptomatic cases, or any case in which the diagnosis is suspect, could also include re-extraction of RNA from the original clinical specimen and testing for different virus target genes, ideally in an independent laboratory.
http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/LaboratoryTestingNovelCoronavirus_21Dec12.pdf

WHO continues to request that Member States report all confirmed and probable cases along with information about their exposures, testing, and clinical course to inform the most effective international preparedness and response. WHO strongly recommends detailed case investigations for every case, case-control-studies for index cases and intensive follow up of contacts with serological testing to improve knowledge of critical features of the MERS-CoV infection.

[The summary of recent findings, recommendations, and peer-review publications above is a helpful synopsis of the state of the art of knowledge about the MERS-CoV as of 9 Jul 2013. The overriding conclusion one comes to is that there is still a large gap in our knowledge of the behavior of this virus. The virus is genetically related to a coronavirus seen in bats, it most likely evolved sometime in mid-2011, but the actual route of infection of humans is not known. It is unclear if there is direct or indirect exposure to bats or bat secretions on the part of the index cases in clusters or in the sporadic cases or if there is contact with an intermediate host such as camels or livestock. Samples of bats and other animals have been taken, but processing and reports on findings are still pending.

Until recently mostly severe cases were identified; in recent weeks milder and asymptomatic cases have been identified through investigations of contacts of confirmed clinical cases. Larger scale serosurveys have been conducted but full results of these studies are still pending.

It appears as though Saudi Arabia is the "epicenter" of the outbreak of MERS-CoV, but cases have occurred in Jordan, UAE, and Qatar. A question that arises is "why Saudi Arabia?" and "why not in the other countries?" What is different? (For a map of the region see http://healthmap.org/r/1HAJ).

The summary above mentions that recommendations for "mass gatherings" are being prepared. The Umrah pilgrimage period is underway, and there is the major flow of pilgrims to and from Saudi Arabia. There are concerns about what will happen with individuals who may be returning to areas with less developed health care systems to handle potential cases of severe illness. The Saudi MOH is a leader in health issues during mass gatherings. Of note, the Saudi Arabian Embassy in the USA is recommending that "Health experts advise the following groups to postpone their plans for Hajj and Omrah [Umrah] this year (2013) for their own safety: The elderly, the terminally ill, pregnant women, and children" (see section 7f at http://saudiembassy.net/services/hajj_requirements.aspx).

We await the conclusions of the IHR Emergency Committee meeting. - Mod.MPP]
