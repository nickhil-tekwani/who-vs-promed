A Grant County resident is recovering from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS], the 1st case of hantavirus [infection] in the state this year [2019]. The hantavirus illness was confirmed by laboratory testing on Friday [10 May 2019] at the state Public Health Laboratory. The individual is expected to survive and is recovering at home.

Hantavirus [causes] a rare illness caused by a virus found in the urine, droppings, and saliva of infected rodents. Deer mice are the only carriers of the virus in Washington. Because deer mice are present throughout Grant County, the risk of hantavirus is countywide.

This is the 1st case of hantavirus in the state this year [2019] and the 4th case in Grant County in the past decade. Another Grant County resident survived the illness last year [2018]. The previous 2 cases in the county occurred in 2012, and both were fatal, according to the health district. On average, one to 5 confirmed cases are reported in Washington each year, mostly from counties in central Washington.

Symptoms of hantavirus [infections] usually begin 1-6 weeks after a person breathes in the virus. Early signs include fever, muscle aches, headaches, dizziness, chills, nausea, and vomiting. As the disease worsens, it causes coughing and shortness of breath and can lead to respiratory failure. About one of 3 people diagnosed with hantavirus [infections] do not survive, according to the health district.

To avoid the virus, the health district recommends avoiding wild rodents and keeping them out of the places you live, work, and play. Remove their sources of food, water, and shelter and keep these areas rodent-proofed.

[The hantavirus involved in the Washington case above and other cases in the western USA is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time. Fortunately, the above case has been released from the hospital and is expected to make a full recovery. This is not always the case. About 1/3 of HPS cases are fatal.

Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine, and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions mentioned in those that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html). The circumstances under which the Grant County resident acquired the infection is not mentioned. In 2017 in Washington, a woman likely acquired her Sin Nombre virus infection from an automobile air system. This illustrates the fact that there is risk of infection anywhere that these mice are present.

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus. An image of the deer mouse can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg and at the above URL. - Mod.TY
