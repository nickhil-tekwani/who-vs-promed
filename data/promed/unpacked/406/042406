News reports indicate that this outbreak of aspergillosis occurred
within the Principe de Asturias Hospital (a brief news item on the
outbreak can be found at
<http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_9393.shtml>.)
According to the Irish Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC,
formerly the National Disease Surveillance Centre): "Nosocomial
outbreaks of invasive aspergillosis have become a well recognised
complication of construction, demolition, or renovation activities in
or near hospital wards accommodating immunocompromised patients.
Nosocomial aspergillosis is a cause of severe illness and mortality
in these patients." (NDSC 2002, National Guidelines for the
Prevention of Nosocomial Invasive Aspergillosis during
Construction/Renovation Activities, available at
<http://www.ndsc.ie/hpsc/A-Z/Respiratory/Aspergillosis/Guidance/File,896,en.pdf>.)
_Aspergillus_ spp. occur commonly in nature, and are associated with
decaying vegetation, soils, compost heaps etc., and can be found
almost anywhere, including in outdoor and indoor air. _Aspergillus
fumigatus_, _A. niger_, and _A. flavus_ are some of the species that
can cause invasive infections, and they are often linked with the
so-called "sick building syndrome". _Aspergillus_ growth may be a
problem indoors, especially in damp older buildings, and demolition
workers, decorators, waste handlers, hospital workers, and patients
could particularly be at risk of increased exposure under certain
circumstances.
I have had some involvement in health risk assessments ahead of
renovations in hospitals, and air quality monitoring including
bioaerosol assays before, during, and after the work is common
practice. It would be interesting to find out if any renovations were
underway at Principe de Asturias Hospital around the time that the
patients became ill. If not, then there could possibly be a more
serious problem with air quality in the building.
