Hello Robert,

Welcome to BSE-L. May I offer my answers/comments to the four questions
that you pose, inserting them after each question.

CJD is, fortunately, so rare that the numbers are indeed too small to draw
reliable epidemiological conclusions. Otherwise, one would have to wonder
what conclusions to draw from the higher incidence of CJD in clergymen and
professional drivers than in the rest of the population. There are no known
cases of CJD in butchers or veterinary surgeons, who might be
hypothetically most at risk in relation to BSE.

CJD world-wide at a more-or-less constant rate regardless of whether BSE
occurs. In Europe, the figures for 1994 are within a range of 0.53 per
million to 1.04 per million (Netherlands). The cases of four farmers with
CJD, and one former abattoir worker who may or may not have CJD, need to be
studied in detail by the relevant experts. Although a similar incidence of
CJD in farmers occurs in countries without BSE, the four farmers do
represent an above-average incidence compared with the rest of the UK
population.

All of the CJD figures referred to are based on direct notification, mainly
by neurologists, of cases classified as definite or probable, using
diagnostic criteria adapted from Masters et al.

Because the possibility of any link or connection between BSE and CJD could
not be ruled out absolutely, the CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh was set
up in 1990. Today, there is still no scientific or epidemiological evidence
of such a link.

There is some evidence of vertical transmission -- cow to calf. It would not
be by milk, which has been shown to be incapable of carrying the infective
agent, but it may be by placental transmission. The completion of long-term
trials to establish definitively whether, and if so, how, vertical
transmission occurs, is expected in February. There is at present no
evidence of transmission by pasture-sharing. I understand that this
possibility is being investigated, although until there is an established
and recognised diagnostic test for incipient BSE in apparently fit live
animals, it is difficult to see how development of BSE in such animals in
the investigation could be necessarily attributed to transmission by
pasture-sharing.

Not as a routine procedure. I understand that a small proportion are
subjected to post-mortem brain tissue examination as part of a Ministry
research project..

No. The infective agent is very heat-resistant. Some loss of infectivity
occurs above 100 deg Celsius; more than 120 deg Celsius is needed for
inactivation. It is also resistant to sterilants and to extremes of pH.

It was a disease, closely resembling CJD, called Kuru, which became
widespread in Papua New Guinea through cannibalism practised by relatives
during mourning rites. It is was particular associated with eating the
brains of the deceased, and is believed to have originated from eating
brains of people who had died from CJD. In a report on an internationally
attended CJD Workshop in Australia in May 1995, it was stated that although
cannibalism supposedly ceased in New Guinea 35 years ago, new cases of Kuru
are still being reported. There were eight cases of Kuru in 1994 in both
males and females aged between 40 and 60. In the 1950s when Kuru was being
investigated nearly all of the victims were females and children. It was
suggested that this was because they were the main consumers of human
brains. As there have been no children coming down with CJD in recent years
it is now considered that vertical transmission does not occur.
