DENGUE/DHF UPDATE 2008 (36): FRANCE ex WEST AFRICA

Reported dengue cases imported from West Africa in France have been
increasing since 2006.

In France, dengue fever was included in mandatory notifiable diseases
in 2006. From 1 Jan 2006 to 8 Aug 2008, 19 dengue cases imported from
West Africa to France have been reported to Institut de Veille
Sanitaire (French Institute for Public Health Surveillance). This
information originates from mandatory notification reports but also
from data provided by a network of laboratories performing biological
diagnosis of dengue and other vector-borne viral infections.
Confirmation of the cases was done either by PCR [polymerase chain
reaction] or serology (IgM).

In 2006, 4 cases were reported (2 from Benin, 1 from Burkina Faso, 1
from Cote d'Ivoire), 7 cases in 2007 (3 from Burkina Faso, 3 from
Cote d'Ivoire, 1 from Senegal), and 8 cases in 2008 up to 8 Aug (7
from Cote d'Ivoire including the recent case diagnosed in Marseille
[ProMED archive no.] 20080808.2446, and 1 from Mali).

To date, 3 other suspected dengue cases from Togo (2 cases) and Ghana
(1 case) are under investigation.

For the 4 [dengue virus serotypes] strains (out of the 19 imported
cases reported) for which serotyping was performed, DENV-1 (2 cases
from Burkina Faso in 2007) and DENV-2 or DENV-3 (2 cases from Cote
d'Ivoire in 2007 and 2008) were isolated. (See
<http://www.invs.sante.fr/international/bhi/bhi_120808.pdf> for more
information in French.)

Although the country of acquisition is insufficiently documented,
this surveillance system allows monitoring trends of imported cases
in continental France. Since the beginning of 2008, dengue cases
imported from Cote d'Ivoire are increasing, which could be related to
an intensification of dengue viruses' circulation in this area.

The dengue virus is circulating in West Africa, but the magnitude of
this circulation in this area remains poorly known. In a context of
high malaria incidence, and in the absence of dengue-specific
preventive or curative measures, most countries in the region have
not implemented specific dengue surveillance system. Therefore, the
circulation of dengue virus in the area is likely to be underestimated.

[ProMED-mail is especially appreciative of Drs La Ruche,
Dejour-Salamanca, and Ledrans for this first-hand report of their
dengue information from West Africa. As they suggest, the lack of a
formal surveillance and reporting system in West Africa no doubt
results in significant under-reporting (or, in many cases no
reporting) of dengue cases. Their information above hints that the
cases in these West African countries is an indication of a much
larger public health problem due to dengue.

ProMED will welcome additional reports on dengue cases originating in
West Africa, as they become available. These imported dengue cases
may provide the only information available about the presence of
dengue virus serotypes circulating currently in West Africa.
