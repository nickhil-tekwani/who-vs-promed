[The fact that 4 holdings (swine, cattle) were found PCR positive,
one day (in 2 cases), 2 days (in one case) and 3 days (in one case)
post-vaccination, is probably due to the vaccinated animals getting
infected prior to their vaccination. This may pose, among other
things, a biosecurity problems, since the vaccinators could have
unknowingly transmitted the virus to other visited holdings, in case
they proceeded their vaccination activities the same day. - Mod.AS]

20 Kagoshima black pigs placed in protective isolation over
foot-and-mouth fears
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20 Kagoshima black pigs raised near the border of Miyazaki Prefecture
were shifted to the southern part of Kagoshima Prefecture on
Wednesday [26 May 2010] over fears that they may be infected with
foot-and-mouth disease [FMD].

The 20 pigs kept at the prefectural livestock experiment station were
transported by truck to Kagoshima Prefectural College of Agriculture
in the city of Hioki to be placed in protective isolation.

The Kagoshima Prefectural Government is considering moving other pigs
to Tanegashima Island in the prefecture.

[Kagoshima Kurobuta is the trademarked name of a rare breed of pig,
bred in Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. Originally this is the British
Berkshire pig breed, said to be "Britain's oldest pig breed." Its
breeding, in the UK, is maintained by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust,
Hertfordshire and the South of England Rare Breeds Centre in Kent. It
is listed as 'vulnerable' as there are fewer than 300 breeding
females. In the United States, the American Berkshire Association,
established in 1875, pedigrees only hogs directly imported from
established English herds, or hogs tracing directly back to such
imported animals.

This is one more example of the potential threat to valuable genetic
resources and to rare breeds/species by FMD and by indiscriminate or
contiguous culling policy.
