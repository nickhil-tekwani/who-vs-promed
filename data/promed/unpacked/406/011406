Dutch authorities destroy 25 000 chickens after mild bird flu found
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dutch agricultural and animal health officials destroyed some 25 000
chickens at a poultry plant at Voorthuizen in the eastern province of
Gelderland on Wednesday [2 Aug 2006] after traces of a mild form of bird
flu were found there.
From Tuesday officials imposed a set of controls around the plant,
including setting up a 6 km zone where the transport of poultry, whether
live or dead, animal feed, eggs, and manure was banned. Controls were
placed on around 130 businesses in the area.
Experts were unanimous in declaring the variant harmless to both poultry
and humans, but there were concerns that it could spread and mutate to a
more dangerous form.
The chickens were destroyed by gassing and removed before the premises were
decontaminated.
The pathogen found was [found to be] much less dangerous than the H7N7
variant that devastated the Dutch poultry industry in 2003, when 31 million
birds were destroyed.
In that outbreak, 19 [sic; a higher number was detected. - Mod. AS] people
became infected and one vet died.
