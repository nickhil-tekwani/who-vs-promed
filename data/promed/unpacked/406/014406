New cases of bird flu have been recorded on 2 farms in north-western
Nigeria, officials say, a year after the disease was 1st found there.
Katsina State health commissioner Ali Hussaini told the BBC that
local health officials had culled 1070 chickens. Some of the infected
birds were found in a backyard farm in Katsina town.
There are fears that 2 other farms, one owned by the chairman of
Nigeria's poultry farmers' association, may also be infected.
"We've heard it, but we are not yet sure. Our surveillance team is
yet to give us the report of their visit to the affected farms," said
Ayokanmi Osinlu, spokesman for Nigeria's health minister.
There have been no human victims in Africa's most populous country
since the deadly H5N1 strain was first recorded early in 2006.
The UN had expressed concerns about the Nigerian government response
to the disease, as poultry are still being moved around by local
farmers despite an official quarantine and promised compensation for
infected birds.
