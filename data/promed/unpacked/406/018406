California TB case resolved
---------------------------
Last week [8-12 Dec 2008], an agreement was reached between the state
of California and RuAnn Dairy and Maddox Dairy of Riverdale,
California, to not depopulate the herds.

Maddox Dairy and RuAnn Dairy became involved in California's latest
outbreak of bovine tuberculosis (TB) during the investigation of
another herd that tested positive for bovine TB in 2007. That herd
had bought 4 replacement heifers from Maddox Dairy. Because cattle
move between Maddox Dairy and RuAnn Dairy, all animals in both herds
had to be tested. Prior to 2002, the RuAnn herd maintained a TB-free
certification.

Every animal was tested 3 times. There were 664 cows that were
caudal-fold suspect/reactors at RuAnn and Maddox Dairies. These
reactors were depopulated. One out of the 664 was found to have a
very small lesion in a lymph gland, yet state and federal
veterinarians were unable to find the infection in her lungs. Maddox
Dairy never had any positive reactors. No additional infected animals
have been found since April [2008].

The agreement that was reached last week was a welcome relief, says
Steve Maddox, owner of Maddox and RuAnn Dairy. Maddox will not be
forced to depopulate his herds, which would have cost USD 40 million
in indemnity payments and 50 years of top genetics.

Maddox and RuAnn Dairy are on a 12-month quarantine program, and
annual testing will follow. Maddox Dairy began its 12-month
quarantine in May 2008 -- the date of its 1st official clean test.
RuAnn Dairy began its 12-month quarantine in November 2008. Maddox
will be allowed to start merchandising bulls from his herds starting
this week [15-19 Dec 2008].

The story published today in Dairy Herd Management and reported in
the USAHA News Alert Summaries, "CA TB case resolved" is not accurate.

Both of these dairy herds, RuAnn and Maddox remain under state
quarantine. However, we have released the quarantine on 2 separate
Bull Units and bulls may now be sold, but only following additional
test requirements.

This decision was based on many factors and agreed to by both USDA
and California. After a lengthy investigation, and multiple herd
tests, there has been only a single infected animal found in the
RuAnn Dairy -- an 8-year-old cow -- with no evidence of any disease
transmission. All caudal fold responders found on the initial 2 herd
tests, including both Bull Units, were purchased and slaughtered
under enhanced surveillance -- more than 600 animals -- with no
additional infected animals found. Additionally, hundreds of bulls
sold in the last few years were traced, purchased and underwent
enhanced surveillance at slaughter; and no additional infected
animals have been found.

Although the Bull Units have been released from quarantine, bulls may
only be sold following both a negative CFT and Gamma interferon blood
test within 60 days of sale, as long as the Maddox and RuAnn herds
remain under quarantine.

Considering the extremely low risk involved in these herds and the
mitigation steps being taken, this action, agreed to by both USDA and
California is prudent. It also reflects the "flexibility" and
science-based approach that stakeholders have recommended at recent
USDA TB Listening Sessions.
