An unknown disease is said to have killed at least 15 South Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) soldiers at Manybol, a military camp in Pibor County in Jonglei State. Speaking to the Sudan Tribune on Monday [30 Sep 2013], the Commissioner of Pibour [sic] County, Joshua Konyi Irer, described the disease as serious and fatal. The Commissioner who visited Manybol 5 days ago [25 Sep 2013] said 3 soldiers died on the day he was at the military camp. "The patients die after a short time," he added.

The Commissioner expressed fears that the yet-to-be diagnosed disease could wipe out the entire SPLA unit in the area saying that 15 soldiers had died since the disease broke out in the 2nd week of September [2013]. He said those infected with the disease are unable to move and complain of headache and fever. No civilian in Manybol is yet to die from the disease but there are fears it could spread to the civilian population.

Attempts by Sudan Tribune to get a comment from the SPLA Commanding Officers in Manybol and the SPLA Spokesperson in Juba were unsuccessful.

Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF) doctors made a visit to Manybol early this month [September 2013] to assess some of the patients suffering from the disease but MSF's communications officer in Juba, Judy Waguma, said it was not possible to ascertain the disease without a full medical examination.

[The news report above describes a rapidly fatal febrile illness among soldiers in a military camp during the past 2 weeks in Pibor County, South Sudan. We are not told of additional symptoms or signs, other than fever, headache, and inability to move. Febrile illnesses that could possibly occur in South Sudan and that have a relatively high case-fatality rate include typhoid fever, plague, yellow fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) (ProMED-mail posts Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Uganda (04): clarification 20130826.1903826), anthrax (http://www.who.int/hac/crises/sdn/sitreps/sudan_eha_28august2011.pdf and http://www.radiomiraya.org/index.php/health/2709-13-suspected-anthrax-infections-in-western-bahr-el-ghazal-state#gsc.tab=0) and meningococcal meningitis (ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - South Sudan: (ML) fatal, sg A 20130504.1690719); but more clinical information is obviously necessary to complete a list of possible causes for this outbreak. (There has been a hepatitis E outbreak in South Sudan this year (2013), but fatalities due to hepatitis E mainly involve pregnant women.) Unfortunately, the 3 Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) clinics in Pibor County, said to be the only source of formal healthcare in Jonglei state, were looted and torched in December 2011 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pibor_County).

Pibor is one of 11 counties in Jonglei State, which is one of the 10 states of South Sudan. Jonglei forms most of the eastern part of the country; it is a very poor state and its economy is dependent upon livestock and agriculture (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonglei). - Mod.ML
