Scores of people in the Netherlands and the USA have caught salmonellosis after eating Dutch smoked salmon, say Dutch health authorities. About 200 people have fallen ill in the Netherlands along with about 100 people in the USA, said the National Institute for Public Health (RIVM). An RIVM official told the BBC that this could be the "tip of the iceberg."

Smoked salmon made by the Dutch fish producer Foppen is being taken off the shelves. Foppen supplies major supermarket chains including large retailer Albert Heijn, said the Dutch food safety authority, the NVWA.

"Some 200 people have fallen ill through contaminated salmon" in the Netherlands, said the RIVM, while about 100 people in the US are infected "by the same type of salmonella, "the institute's Hareld Wychgel told the BBC -- "the real number of infected people is likely to be much higher."

Smoked salmon produced by Foppen has been taken off the shelves in the Netherlands, and an international recall targeting salmon sold in the US was being prepared. In a statement on its website, Foppen offered its "sincere apologies for any inconvenience."

Smoked salmon tainted with salmonellae has sickened hundreds of people in the Netherlands and the USA, sparking a major recall, health authorities said Tue 2 Oct 2012.

The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment said the salmon has been traced to Dutch company Foppen, which sells fish to many major Dutch supermarkets and to stores around the world, including the United States.

Foppen company spokesman Bart de Vries said that since the company set up a public information phone 2 two days ago 30 Sep 2012], some 1400 people had called and around 350 of the callers "reported symptoms consistent with a salmonellosis."

De Vries said that in the USA the company sells only to wholesaler Costco and that Costco would deal with any USA recall. It was not immediately clear how much contaminated fish had been sold in USA. A message left at Costco's headquarters before office hours was not immediately returned.

Roel Vincken of the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority, which carried out tests confirming the salmonella outbreak, said he had no information on a USA recall.

De Vries said the company did not believe contaminated fish had been sold to any other countries.

Foppen, which processes fish in the Netherlands and at a factory in Greece, is investigating the cause of the outbreak. "The investigation into the cause is under way and has been narrowed down to one production line at one factory (in Greece)," De Vries told The Associated Press. "We can't yet say what the cause of the infection was."

Foppen has halted all production of smoked salmon until the investigation is completed, he added.

[The serotype of _S. enterica_ in this rather large outbreak at onset of report is not stated.

It appears that no alert or recall has yet been issued by USA governmental agencies or from Costco.

Outbreaks of human salmonellosis related to fish for eating are uncommon and are more likely to be related to contamination of the fish after they are caught. - Mod.LL
