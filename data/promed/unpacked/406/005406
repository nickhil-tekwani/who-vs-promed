A man died of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), commonly known as Congo virus, at a private hospital of the metropolis on Sunday [28 Jul 2019], raising the death toll due to the disease to 5 in Karachi in the ongoing year.

According to details, a 27-year-old man hailing from Landhi was shifted to a local private hospital where he died due to complications of CCHF.

The deceased had tested positive for the viral disease, "and his condition was very serious due to low platelets count," the hospital sources said.

CCHF is a lethal viral infection that is transmitted to humans from animals, especially cattle and livestock.

Patients are kept in isolation wards to prevent other patients, doctors, and paramedics from contracting the viral infection.

[The number of CCHF cases continues to increase slowly in Sindh province, Pakistan. According to a 25 Jul 2019 report, there were 8 cases of CCHF with 5 deaths reported in the province from 1 Jan to 16 Jul 2019 (see Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Asia (08): Pakistan (SD) 20190727.6590709). The new case raises that total to 9 cases and 6 deaths in the province.

The circumstances under which this latest case acquired his infection are not mentioned. As Mod.UBA noted in the previous Sindh CCHF post: "In absence of an effective vaccine, taking measures to prevent exposure to the virus is the key to preventing tick-to-human, animal-to-human, and human-to-human transmission in the community. WHO-recommended measures for prevention and control of CCHF are available at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever/en/.

In view of the Eid ul-Azha festival in a few weeks, information on preventive measures targeting those with potential for accidental or occupational exposure is already being disseminated by departments of health through print and electronic media in order to increase public awareness on possible exposure to ticks and CCHF virus. Use of tick repellents, wearing protective clothing and avoiding contact with blood and body fluids of livestock are recommended. Ticks should be safely removed and not crushed with fingers (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever/introduction.pdf?ua=1). Strict universal precautions should be taken with hospitalized cases to prevent nosocomial infections.

Individuals with contact with livestock and symptoms of hemorrhagic fever should seek immediate medical care. In absence of any specific treatment, general supportive treatment of symptoms with particular attention to fluid balance and correction of electrolyte abnormalities, oxygenation and hemodynamic support, and appropriate treatment of secondary infection can be provided. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used to treat CCHF patients with some benefit (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/crimean-congo/treatment/index.html)." - Mod.UBA
