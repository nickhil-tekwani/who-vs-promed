The 1st indigenous case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in South Africa was reported in 1981 -- fatal infection acquired in Transvaal. At the time of the report, 7 percent of persons in the area were found to be seropositive.
- Highest incidence is reported in the Karoo, the Western Free State, the Northern Cape and North West Province.
