Virus-like disease symptoms were observed in 4 fields of lettuce in 3 regions of central and south-eastern Greece. In all cases, the disease affected 30-40% of the plants. Symptoms consisted of brown ringspots, necrotic lesions, vein necrosis, and leaf distortion resembling those associated with tospovirus infections.

Samples [were tested] for the presence of _Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (TSWV), _Tomato chlorotic spot virus_ (TCSV), _Impatiens necrotic spot virus_ (INSV), _Groundnut ringspot virus_ (GRSV) and _Chrysanthemum stem necrosis virus_ (CSNV). RT-PCR assays and molecular sequencing confirmed that the causal agent was INSV.

This virus is an important pathogen for several crops including tomato and lettuce. The relatively high incidence of the virus in different regions suggests that INSV is an emerging [pathogen] for lettuce cultivation in Greece.

[_Impatiens necrotic spot virus_ (INSV) was considered a strain of _Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (TSWV; type species of genus _Orthotospovirus_, previously _Tospovirus_) but has since been classified as a separate species in the genus. It has a wide host range and is of significant economic importance for many crop and ornamental hosts. The virus is distributed in Europe and North America and has also been identified in a few locations elsewhere. INSV is transmitted by the western flower thrips _Frankliniella occidentalis_, other thrips vectors have so far not been recorded. INSV has been included on the A2 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). The other viruses mentioned above are also all species of _Orthotospovirus_.

Tospoviruses are an extremely important group of plant viruses capable of infecting a large range of crops. They are transmitted exclusively by thrips species, which are found worldwide. Weed species can serve as pathogen or vector reservoirs and tospovirus epidemiology is complex. Disease management is difficult but may include vector control (for glasshouse crops), use of clean planting material, control of weed hosts of virus and vectors, phytosanitary measures, as well as use of resistant crop cultivars. Due to their agricultural importance, research on tospoviruses has increased dramatically in recent years. As a result, many new species are being found and many more can be expected to exist.
