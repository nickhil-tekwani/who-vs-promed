In its [23 Jul 2020] Situation Report, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed Adair, Nowata, and Tulsa counties in Oklahoma as newly infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). These are in addition to Osage and Ottawa counties, which were confirmed as newly infected in APHIS' [20 Jul 2020] Situation Report, and Craig and Washington counties, which were previously reported with confirmed cases.

Presently, quarantined premises in Oklahoma counties include:

Adair (1)
Craig (1)
Nowata (1)
Osage (2)
Ottawa (3)
Tulsa (1)
Washington (4)

This year's [2020] VSV outbreak began on [13 Apr 2020] in Dona Ana County, New Mexico, and spread to Oklahoma on [7 Jul 2020] (Washington County). Other states with current outbreaks include Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska. All previously infected premises have been released from quarantine in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.

Premises with confirmed positive and suspect cases are quarantined and monitored by veterinarians for at least 14 days from the onset of lesions in the last animal affected.

Vesicular stomatitis virus can cause blisters and sores in the mouth and on the tongue, muzzle, teats, or hooves of horses, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and a number of other animals. Lesions usually heal in 2 or 3 weeks.

Because of the virus' contagious nature and its resemblance to other diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, animal health officials urge livestock owners and caretakers to report these symptoms to their veterinarian immediately. Most animals recover with supportive care by a veterinarian.

"Vesicular stomatitis has been conÔ¨Årmed only in the Western Hemisphere," APHIS said on its website. "It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, and outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically. The Southwestern and Western United States have experienced a number of vesicular stomatitis outbreaks ... Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways." According to Angela Pelzel McCluskey, DVM, APHIS' equine epidemiologist, the largest VS outbreak in more than 40 years of recorded history occurred in 2019.

Some states and other countries might restrict movement of, or impose additional requirements for, susceptible animals from states having known VS cases. Before moving livestock, contact the state of destination for its requirements.

The Kansas Department of Agriculture says it has recorded positive cases of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus, a virus primarily affecting horse and cattle, in 24 counties and 97 premises have tested positive. It says of the 97 positive residences, 51 are currently under quarantine.

The KDA says the following counties have had positive cases of VSV: Allen, Bourbon, Butler, Chase, Cherokee, Coffey, Cowley, Crawford, Elk, Franklin, Greenwood, Labette, Linn, Lyon, Marion, Miami, Montgomery, Morris, Neosho, Riley, Sedgwick, Sumner, Wilson, Woodson.

According to the KDA, the outbreak began in south-central Kansas in mid-June [2020] and has now expanded its reach to the north and east. It says it is waiting for laboratory results from animals having shown signs in other counties as the outbreak spreads.

The KDA says all premises with confirmed cases of VSV in horses and cattle have been quarantined and those showing clinical signs of the virus have also been placed under quarantine. It says quarantine lasts for 14 days after the onset of signs appears in the last animal on the premises and is not lifted until a veterinarian has given each animal an examination.

[Vesicular stomatitis is a viral disease which primarily affects horses, cattle, and swine. The agent causing vesicular stomatitis, Vesicular Stomatitis virus (VSV), has a wide host range and can occasionally infect sheep and goats. In affected livestock, VSV causes blister-like lesions to form in the mouth and on the dental pad, tongue, lips, nostrils, hooves, and teats. These blisters swell and break, leaving raw tissue that is so painful that infected animals generally refuse to eat and drink and show signs of lameness. Severe weight loss usually follows, and in dairy cows a severe drop in milk production commonly occurs. Affected dairy cattle can appear to be normal and will continue to eat about half of their feed intake.
