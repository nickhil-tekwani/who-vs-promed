Denmark; New Avian Influenza Virus A H5N7 Identified in Ducks
---------------------------------------------------
A new influenza A virus type, H5N7, has been identified for the first
time in ducks in Denmark (1). Following disease among 12 000 ducks
raised to be released for hunting at a duck farm near the town of
Salling in Jutland, 2 viruses were identified: a Duck Virus Enteritis
(DVE), which caused the disease, and an influenza A virus. All ducks
had to be exterminated on 10 Sep 2003 due to the disease.
The influenza A virus was isolated from the tissues of several of the
ducks. The Statens Serum Institut used full-length haemagglutinin and
neuraminidase reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction (HA and NA
RT-PCR) with routine sequencing, which is used directly on clinical
samples rather than cultured virus, to genotype this new virus as
H5N7. This type has never previously been identified, and further
analysis is now being carried out on the virus. Importantly, this new
virus has not been detected in humans, especially not among those
people who had contact with these ducks, or in several unrelated
influenza A virus cases (H3N2) diagnosed in Denmark since 1 Sep 2003.
12 avian influenza A virus (AIV) strains have been isolated from wild
birds in Denmark since 1996, none of which have been H5 or H7.
Influenza A viruses are divided in 15 subtypes based on HA (H1-15)
and 9 subtypes based on NA (N1-9). Wild birds seem to be the natural
reservoir for avian influenza (AIV). Although low-pathogenic H5 and
H7 exist, all highly pathogenic AIV are either H5 or H7.
Pathogenicity of H5 and H7 AIV depends at least partly on the amino
acid sequence at the cleavage site in HA1/HA2.
Such pathogenic sequences were not found. Therefore this AIV strain
is being grouped as having low pathogenicity. The potential to change
pathogenicity -- during replication in birds or recombination in pigs
and/or humans, for example -- is not known. Highly pathogenic AIV of
type H5 and N7 have occasionally infected humans. This occurred in
Hong Kong in 1997 (H5N1), where 6 of 18 infected patients died (2),
and again in 2003 where 1 of 2 infected humans died, and in the
Netherlands (H7N7) (3) in 2003, where 1 of 80 infected patients died.
The World Health Organization has recommended that all countries
establish national pandemic planning committees in case of influenza
epidemics.

Laboratory surveillance networks and fast genotyping methods should
be integral to the work of these national committees.
