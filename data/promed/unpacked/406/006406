Officials with Maricopa County Animal Care and Control are alerting the public after diagnosing 2 positive cases of canine influenza (H3N2).

According to officials, it's the 1st time the disease has been seen in Arizona. Officials say the disease can be "highly contagious." In its mild form, dogs develop "soft moist cough" that can persist from 10 to 30 days. In severe illness, dogs can develop fevers that can lead to pneumonia. It can be fatal in less than 10 percent of infections, officials said.

A vaccine can help prevent the virus. According to officials, the H3N2 vaccine is "highly recommended" for dogs that frequently come into contact with other dogs, visit dog parks or kennels, or travel a lot.

Although there are no cases of the virus transferring to humans, humans can pass it to dogs, meaning that if we come into contact with the virus, our 4-legged friends could potently catch it.

Proper hygiene, including handwashing for anyone who comes into contact with an unfamiliar dog, is recommended to prevent the spread of the virus.

"This diagnosis is an important reminder that flu season is among us," MCACC wrote in a news release. "Our canine friends rely on us to keep them safe from these and other viruses."

MCACC said it is taking a proactive stance on the virus and reminds dog owners that it is important to keep canine companions up-to-date on vaccines and maintain regular vet visits.

["Canine influenza [CI] or dog flu is a highly contagious respiratory infection of dogs that is caused by an influenza A virus. In the US, CI has been caused by 2 influenza strains. The 1st strain reported in the United States, beginning in 2004, was an H3N8 influenza A virus. This strain is closely related to the virus that causes equine influenza, and it is thought that the equine influenza virus mutated to produce the canine strain. In 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was caused by a separate CI virus, H3N2. The strain causing the 2015 outbreak was almost genetically identical to an H3N2 strain previously reported only in Asia -- specifically, Korea, China, and Thailand. In Asia, this H3N2 strain is believed to have resulted from the direct transfer of an avian influenza virus -- possibly from among viruses circulating in live bird markets -- to dogs. Since March 2015, thousands of dogs have been confirmed positive for H3N2 CI across the US" https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/FAQs/Pages/Control-of-Canine-Influenza-in-Dogs.aspx.

Healthy dogs can be vaccinated and should be if you must board your animal. There is a vaccine for both strains of the flu mentioned above. If the virus is circulating in your area, avoiding canine social activities (dog parks, play dates, interactions in the park, etc.) may help protect your dog. - Mod.TG
