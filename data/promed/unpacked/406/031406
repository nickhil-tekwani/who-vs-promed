Food poisoning downs 500 Santa Ana kids
---------------------------------------
Doctors at Manila's public hospitals had their hands full yesterday, as
parents of over 500 students of the Thomas Earnshaw Elementary School in
Santa Ana brought in feverish and vomiting children for treatment.
While parents initially claimed that the mass illness was brought on by
food poisoning, doctors said the large number of victims and their symptoms
suggested a waterborne virus.
At the Ospital ng Maynila, pediatrics resident Dr Chris Graheda said 350
children were brought in between midnight on Saturday and press time
yesterday. But he said most of the children were released by mid-afternoon,
with only around 20 admitted [for intravenour rehydration]. Mandaluyong
Medical Center had 100 patients, the Philippine General Hospital 50, and
Lourdes Hospital 25. Graheda said the patients shared the same symptoms:
moderate to high fever, followed by abdominal pain, then vomiting, and
loose bowel movements.
Graheda cautioned against diagnosing food poisoning prematurely. He said
the hospital has coordinated with the City of Manila's food and sanitation
bureau and school authorities. Laboratory technicians were already
culturing samples of food and water from the school, he added.
Department of Education health and nutrition chief Thelma Santos said the
school management could face sanctions if investigators traced the incident
to negligence. Parents claimed the children got sick after eating tuna and
egg sandwiches bought from the school canteen. They said students had been
banned from bringing home-cooked food. Dr Ofelia Viray, school principal,
denied the charge and said she had never issued such a policy.

[While this newswire mentions a waterborne virus as the probable culprit,
it's too early to rule out other equally likely culprits such as salmonella
or staphylococcal toxin. If the luncheon sandwiches are shown to be
epidemiologically linked to this outbreak, the incubation period is just
right for salmonellosis and a bit long for staphylococcal toxin, but we do
not know for sure that the cases did not begin Friday evening (which would
be consistent with staphylococcal toxin). More information on both the
epidemiological and laboratory investigations associated with this outbreak
would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
