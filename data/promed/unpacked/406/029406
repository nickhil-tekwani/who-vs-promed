The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services said on Friday [5 Nov 2021] that 3 adults have tested positive for the Jamestown Canyon virus, 3 months after an adult who became infected with the mosquitoborne virus died. The 3 adults are from Loudon, Pittsfield and Rumney, the department said in a news release. The person from Loudon wasn't hospitalized and is in good health. The others were hospitalized with neurological symptoms. They are now recovering at home, the department said.

"With these 3 JCV infections happening in early fall, it is important to remember the season of mosquitoes is longer than just the summer months," Dr Benjamin Chan, state epidemiologist, said in a statement. "Mosquitoes can continue to transmit infections like Jamestown Canyon virus until there is a mosquito-killing hard frost."

Early symptoms can include fever, muscle aches, headaches, and fatigue. Central nervous system disease, including meningitis or encephalitis, can occur with the virus, as well as with 2 other mosquitoborne viruses, eastern equine encephalitis, and West Nile.

In August [2021], the department reported that Jamestown Canyon virus was identified as a contributing cause to the death of an adult from Dublin, New Hampshire. The state has detected 18 cases of the virus since the first report of the disease in the state in 2013.

The infection-risk level for Loudon, Rumney, and Pittsfield has been increased to high. The level for these surrounding communities is increasing to moderate: Wentworth, Warren, Ellsworth, Campton, Plymouth, Groton, Dorchester, Chichester, Gilmanton, Barnstead, Strafford, Northwood, Pembroke, Concord and Canterbury.

[Jamestown Canyon (JC) virus transmission has been active this summer and into the autumn. Temperatures have now declined under the freezing point in New Hampshire, adult mosquitoes are dead now and transmission has ended for the year (2021) with 4 confirmed JC cases. There have been a few JC cases in previous years. There were 5 cases last year (2020). Fatalities such as the one reported in the previous post are rare indeed. Avoidance of mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites as recommended above are prudent preventive measures.

As noted in previous ProMED posts, JCV was first isolated from a pool of 9 _Culiseta inornata_ mosquitoes captured in Jamestown Canyon, Colorado, in 1961 and later shown to be widely distributed in the eastern and midwestern USA. Boreal (northern) aedes and ochlerotatus mosquitoes are the primary vectors. As with the other California serogroup orthobunyaviruses, transovarial virus transmission is common, with newly emerging female mosquitoes already infected with the virus in the spring and ready to transmit it. White-tailed deer, _Odocoileus virginianus_, are the principal amplification hosts.

As Drs Charles Calisher and Paul Grimstad pointed out in ProMED post Jamestown Canyon virus, mosquitoes - USA (NY) (03) 20040807.2171, JCV frequently seems to be forgotten as an etiological agent of human disease. That post provides related references. - Mod.TY
