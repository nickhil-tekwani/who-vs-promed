The health deputy of Iran's Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences has said Varamin, on the southern edge of the capital Tehran, is a cutaneous leishmaniasis endemic region in the country. Sohrabi said 48 patients have so far been identified and treated. He added that all healthcare centers are ready to give services to people suffering from cutaneous leishmaniasis.

According to Sohrabi, the healthcare centers are eliminating contaminated rodents and dogs to bring the disease under control. While noting that Varamin is an endemic region of cutaneous leishmaniasis, Sohrabi said each year a number of cases are reported in the area.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis is the most common form of leishmaniasis affecting humans. It is a skin infection caused by a single-celled parasite that is transmitted by the bite of a phlebotomine sand fly.

[Leishmaniasis is endemic in Iran. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by _Leishmania tropica_ is found in Tehran as well as in some other large or medium-sized cities and their outskirts. CL caused by _Leishmania major_ is endemic and very common in many rural areas, especially in the plains of the northeast, near the Russian border, and in the north of the Esfahan province, in the centre of the country, but has recently spread to its southern parts and to Fars province, in southwest Iran. About 70% of CL in Iran is caused by _L. major_. The reservoir is rodents and dogs.
