The 3rd human case of plague in the last 5 weeks has been reported in
La Plata County, according to the San Juan Basin Health Department.
The male patient was released from the hospital after several days
and is recovering at home, said Lynn Westberg, the executive director
of the Health Department. While it is the 3rd case of the plague in
the county in 2006, there have been 5 human cases in the last 12 months.
"I am quite concerned by the situation in La Plata County right now,"
said Joe Fowler, regional epidemiologist for the Health Department.
"The entire state of Colorado has never had more than 4 cases in a
single year, but in 2006, if our residents do not take precautions to
protect themselves, La Plata County could single-handedly surpass that number."
In New Mexico in 2006, 2 of the 6 people who have contracted the
disease died. Historically, in Colorado, about 1 in 5 cases results
in death, the health department said in a news release.
"The plague is so widespread," Fowler said, "that the health
department hesitates to say what regions these individual cases are
popping up in because people don't think it is in their area. But
it's all over Southwest Colorado." Westberg said that no other human
cases have been reported in the state, but animals have tested
positive in both Archuleta and Montezuma counties as well.
At least 8 animals in Southwest Colorado, including squirrels,
household cats and prairie dogs, have tested positive for plague this
summer, according to the news release. Cats become infected from
flea bites or by direct contact with infected rodents.
Plague-infected cats generally will have a history of roaming freely
in rural or semi-rural areas, and their owners often report that they
are known hunters.
The plague season generally begins in mid-August and continues for
about 2 months, Westberg said. If it gets really hot, it will knock
it out, she said.
"Everyone in Southwest Colorado should be on high alert," Fowler said.

southern USA with more cases recognized this year. Although not
stated, the case was probably one of the bubonic variety. La Plata
county is found in the southwestern part of the state on the following map:

Mexico, which has reported cases since May this year -- see below. -
