The state health department is warning about an increase in the amount of people getting sick due to _E. coli_. State agencies and local health departments are investigating cases in Kent County, Ottawa County and Oakland County, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) said in a Tuesday [16 Aug 2022] release. It said it has received 98 reports of infections due to _E. coli_ this month [August 2022]. It only had 20 cases during the same time period in 2021.

"While reports of _E. coli_ illness typically increase during the warmer summer months, this significant jump in cases is alarming," Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, the MDHHS chief medical executive, said in the release. She said it is important to practice good hand hygiene and food safety.

A toddler from Ottawa County is in a Grand Rapids ICU, battling a disease caused by [a strain of] the _E. coli_ bacteria. She, along with several others in the county, has been hospitalized as lakeshore health officials issued a warning to residents about the increase in cases.

The family from Hudsonville worry, as they have no idea where she contracted the bacteria. Their little girl isn't even 2 years old yet, but is fighting with everything she has at Helen DeVos Children's Hospital after contracting the _E. coli_ bacteria. "It was probably Wednesday or Thursday [10-11 Aug 2022] when she was starting to show symptoms," said the toddler's mother. "She had bloody diarrhea, she was lethargic and just really exhausted."

The Ottawa County Department of Public Health (OCDPH) said that as of 16 Aug 2022, there are 14 cases of Shiga-toxin producing _E. coli_ infections in the county.

"We brought her to the hospital on Saturday [13 Aug 2022] when she had bloody diarrhea," the toddler's mother explained. "They didn't find anything at that time, so we took her to her regular doctor, but by Monday [15 Aug 2022], she was still having it so they told us to go back, and that's when she was admitted. She has also been extremely dehydrated because she wouldn't pee or eat anything," added the mother, "so she really hasn't eaten since Friday [12 Aug 2022]."

According to the OCDPH, of the 14 cases, 5 of those people are hospitalized, and 2 of the cases have hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which is a rare but serious disease that affects the kidneys and blood clotting functions. The mother says her daughter is one of the 2 with HUS.

"Especially in children, it can shut down their kidneys to the point where they may need a ventilator like my daughter was on," she said. "She is also on dialysis right now to get all the fluids off her body in order for her to be functional."

The mother said she has no idea where her daughter could have gotten the _E. coli_, but is hoping that the OCDPH will soon have more definitive answers.

[The serotype of the enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ is not stated. The prototypic strain is O157:H7. It is possible that this outbreak and the one in Ohio may have the same source. ProMED awaits more information, but a presumptive vehicle for some, if not most, of the cases ought to be found using food surveys or history of recent visits to petting zoos or other high-risk places.

Michigan and Ohio are adjacent states in the upper midwestern area of the USA. - Mod.LL
