Epidemiology of human West Nile virus infections in the European Union and European Union enlargement countries, 2010 to 2018. Johanna J Young1,2, Joana M Haussig1,2, Stephan W Aberle3, Danai Pervanidou4, Flavia Riccardo5, Nebojsa Sekulic6, Tamas Bakonyi1, Celine M Gossner
-----------------------------------------
Background
West Nile virus (WNV) circulates in an enzootic cycle involving mosquitoes and birds; humans are accidental hosts.

Aim
We analysed human WNV infections reported between 2010 and 2018 to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to better understand WNV epidemiology.

Methods
We describe probable and confirmed autochthonous human cases of WNV infection reported by European Union (EU) and EU enlargement countries. Cases with unknown clinical manifestation or with unknown place of infection at NUTS 3 or GAUL 1 level were excluded from analysis.

Results
From southern, eastern, and western Europe, 3849 WNV human infections and 379 deaths were reported. Most cases occurred between June and October. Two large outbreaks occurred, in 2010 (n = 391) and in 2018 (n = 1993). The outbreak in 2018 was larger than in all previous years, and the 1st cases were reported unusually early. The number of newly affected areas (n = 45) was higher in 2018 than in previous years, suggesting wider spread of WNV.

Conclusion
Real-time surveillance of WNV infections is key to ensuring that clinicians and public health authorities receive early warning about the occurrence of cases and potential unusual seasonal patterns. Human cases may appear shortly after 1st detection of animal cases. Therefore, public health authorities should develop preparedness plans before the occurrence of human or animal WNV infections.

Unprecedented increase of West Nile virus neuroinvasive disease, Spain, summer 2020.

------------------------------------------
Cases of West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND) in Spain increased in summer 2020. Here, we report on this increase and the local, regional, and national public health measures taken in response.

We analyzed data from regional surveillance networks and the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network, both for human and animal West Nile virus (WNV) infection. During the 2020 season, a total of 77 human cases of WNV infection (median age 65 years; 60% males) were detected in the south-west of Spain; 72 (94%) of these cases developed WNND, presenting as meningoencephalitis, 7 of which were fatal.

In the previous 2 decades, only 6 human cases of WNND were detected in Spain. Reduced activities for vector control this season, together with other factors, might have contributed to the massive increase.

Public health measures, including vector control, campaigns to raise awareness among physicians and the general population, and interventions to ensure the safety of donations of blood products, organs, cells, and tissues were effective to reduce transmission.

Going forward, maintenance of vector control activities and an update of the vector-borne diseases response plan in Spain are needed.

[The authors state: "The risk of transmission is considered moderate in extended areas in Spain where WNV has been detected in animals and/or human cases have already occurred, either during the 2020 season or in previous ones. The impact is considered high because of the severity and mortality usually associated with WNND and actually observed in the outbreak described. Additionally, even when the healthcare system is sufficiently prepared, there is no specific effective treatment available for WNND. In other territories, where WNV has never been detected in horses, birds, or mosquitoes, the risk is considered lower, but ongoing extension of virus circulation into new territories is expected. During the winter months, the risk is very low throughout Spain."

The WNV outbreak in Spain in 2020 as detected by surveillance systems and responded to with a coordinated multisectoral response resulted in updating the national plan on animal surveillance and the addition of entomological surveillance components. - Mod.UBA
