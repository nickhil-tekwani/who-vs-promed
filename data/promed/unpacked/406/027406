Western Sydney's sizzling heat claimed the lives of hundreds of young flying foxes during the weekend [6 and 7 Jan 2018]. The final count could run into the thousands.

WIRES (Wildlife Rescue NGO) volunteers worked around the clock to treat as many as possible in the Parramatta Park and Campbelltown bat colonies and keep the remaining bats cool with misting.

The barometer peaked at noon, reaching 43 deg. C (109.4 deg.F) at Parramatta Park. Volunteers from WIRES North West worked alongside Sydney Wildlife volunteers. "The efforts of our volunteers were both heroic and heartbreaking," WIRES said on social media.

"In extremely tiring conditions they worked tirelessly to provide subcutaneous fluids to the pups that could be reached and many lives were saved but, sadly, many were lost too. A very tough and very sad day."

Flying foxes belong to the genus _Pteropus_, and they are the largest bats in the world. There are several species. They are reservoirs of the Australian bat lyssavirus (ABL), a potentially lethal zoonotic virus.

Extreme temperatures have shown to be lethal for flying foxes in the past. A scientific article published by Proceedings of the Royal Society B (http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1633/419.short), reported several mortality events due to heat waves. The effects of extremes temperature on flying-foxes highlight the implications of climate change on flying-fox conservation. - Mod.PMB
