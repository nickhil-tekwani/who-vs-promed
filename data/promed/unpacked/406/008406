A 3rd case of chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been confirmed in Sweden in a 10-year-old (age determined by counting dental layers) female moose (_Alces alces_), hunted in Arjeplog [Norrbotten County]. According to hunters, the animal did not display clinical signs. Brainstem was positive in rapid test, Biorad TeSeE ELISA, and confirmed positive in Biorad Western Blot. Material will be sent to reference laboratories.

The 1st 2 cases in Sweden, 2 16-year-old female moose, were similar to the Norwegian moose-cases described by Prisinu et al (Novel type of chronic wasting disease detected in moose (_Alces alces_), Norway., Emerg Infect Dis. 2018; 24(12): 2210-18). Bioassays are ongoing.

It is hypothesised the CWD cases in older moose may not be contagious, but rather a spontaneous variant of CWD occurring in old animals (Prisinu et al). Spontaneous prion diseases occur in other species (such as, atypical BSE and atypical scrapie), predominantly in older animals, and detected prevalence vary between the species.

The maximum life length of a moose is approximately 20 years. The region where all 3 Swedish cases were found have a hunting management which leads to a high proportion of old female moose in the local population.

The detection of a 3rd case of CWD in moose in a limited geographical area, with a limited number of examined animals (only 230 moose examined, detected prevalence 1.3 percent) does not necessarily mean a contagious variant of the disease is present in the region. But the apparent clustering does raise concerns. Further analysis of the material from the 3rd case is needed in order to characterise the type of prion disease. Continued surveillance is also needed to understand the epidemiological pattern of the disease regarding geographical occurrence and factors related to the population.

The CWD cases and surveillance in wildlife are displayed on a map at the SVA, National Veterinary Institute (https://www.sva.se/en/animal-health/wildlife/map-of-chronic-wasting-disease-cwd)

The National Veterinary Institute would like to thank the National Veterinary Institute of Norway, which is OIE reference laboratory for CWD, and the European Union reference laboratory for TSE in Italy for invaluable help with these cases. We also thank partners elsewhere for ongoing studies to characterise the CWD cases in Sweden.

[ProMED thanks Dr Noremark for her report of a 3rd case of CWD in Sweden.

With so few cases it is difficult to draw firm conclusions. However, the consistent locale seems to be perhaps suspicious. Are these older animals common throughout the area? Or is there something particular in this region where there may be more older animals?

We look forward to the results of the investigation. - Mod.TG
