[1] Qatar: new case (4th) 29-year-old male

A 29-year-old Qatari youth has been infected with the coronavirus-Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) in the 2nd incident of its kind reported in the country in a week.

The new case apparently involves the youngest victim in Qatar infected with the virus until now, and has taken the total number of MERS cases in the country to 4.

The Supreme Council of Health (SCH) said yesterday [26 Aug 2013] that the patient was in critical condition, in the intensive care unit of the Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC).

The victim was suffering from asthma, the SCH said in a statement last evening [26 Aug 2013].

"After checking the patient, samples have been sent to the National Influenza Laboratory and abroad for further tests."

Last Tuesday [20 Aug 2013], the SCH announced the 3rd MERS case in Qatar, involving a 59-year-old citizen, who experienced symptoms while he was out of the country. The case was confirmed after tests at the laboratory.

Two Qataris were infected by the virus earlier, one of them died in a London hospital in June [2013], about 9 months after he was reported ill.

Until now, 104 MERS cases have been reported across the world and 49 victims have died. The majority of the dead were above 40 years. The highest number of cases -- 82 -- were reported in the neighbouring Saudi Arabia, including 41 deaths.

The SCH said that it was monitoring the situation and taking steps to fight the virus by isolating each acute respiratory infection case.

People returning from vacation have been advised to undergo a check-up in any of the clinics or primary health centres if they experience symptoms associated with the disease. Common symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, and vomiting.

The SCH has created a special link on its website to raise awareness about the disease and set up a hotline -- 6674 0948 -- available round the clock.

In view of an increase in cases, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has advised all member states to continue surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and carefully review any unusual patterns.

Member states have also been asked to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection. The organisation, however, has not recommended any special screenings at points of entry or the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[While this case involves a relatively young individual compared with the majority of cases, the individual had a significant chronic co-morbidity -- asthma -- that would predispose to serious disease when infected with a respiratory illness-producing virus such as the MERS-CoV. Information on possible travel history of this case prior to onset of symptoms or other possible risk exposures would be greatly appreciated.

As mentioned in the newswire above, this raises the global count of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection to 104 including 49 deaths.

[2] Qatar: 3rd case, ex Saudi Arabia

The condition of a 59-year-old Qatari man diagnosed with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is stable, local Arabic daily Al Arab reported.

The patient, receiving treatment at Hamad General Hospital, had returned from Saudi Arabia, where he had probably gone for Umrah [pilgrimage], sources told the daily.

The health of his family members, relatives, and others he met after returning to Qatar, was also being monitored.

A source at the hospital said the latest case of MERS-CoV should not spark fears among the residents of Qatar as the situation was being closely monitored.

The newly infected man was reported to have experienced the symptoms while abroad and got a check up after returning to Qatar.

[In the prior ProMED-mail posts announcing the 3rd case of MERS-CoV in a Qatari national, we requested information on travel history of the case as newswires had mentioned illness began while outside of Qatar. While it appears as though this individual had been travelling as a pilgrim in Saudi Arabia when he became ill, his full travel history during the entire incubation period for MERS-CoV remains unclear. It is possible this individual was in more than one country during the incubation period. "Sporadic cases" of MERS-CoV infection have been reported in Qatar, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan. - Mod.MPP
