Family members and labor leaders denounced the El Tabacal factory for the precarious safety conditions under which the company employees work. A 29 year old man who worked in the El Tabacal plant became ill over a month ago.

It took nearly 15 days to determine that he had a hantavirus [infection], a terribly painful hemorrhagic disease that is endemic in the north of the province. Family members and labor leaders stated that the El Tabacal factory is responsible for his death.

Both PROSEGUR, a [security] contractor for the plant where the man worked, as well as El Tabacal provided no response to the charges made by UPSRA (Union for Security Personnel of the Republic of Argentina) about the precarious conditions under which the employees work.

Javier Romero, UPSRA delegate, stated: "We have described this situation and complained to the Ministry of Labor about the conditions of the workers, but the company has not met the requirements, nor has the ministry gone to inspect." Finally, Romero indicated that, "it is proven that a fellow worker died from [a] hantavirus infection contracted in his workplace."

[No epidemiological information is provided in the above report that would give an indication of the specific circumstances under which the unfortunate security worker contracted his infection, either at work, at home, or elsewhere. Rodent reservoirs of hantaviruses in Argentina or their habitats are not mentioned in the above report, nor is there any indication which hantavirus might be responsible for this death.

Cases of hantavirus infections were reported from various parts of Argentina last year (2012). The specific hantaviruses involved in these cases, including the current one above, are not specified. As noted in ProMED-mail archive number 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in north western Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, but Oran virus seems like a good possibility, since the case occurred in Oran municipality.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Oran hantavirus, can be seen at http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1260.jpeg.
