UNDIAGNOSED DISEASE, MAIZE - KENYA: (RIFT VALLEY)

For the last 3 months, residents in Bomet County [Rift Valley province] have been concerned about the strange disease that has raided their farms. It is fast dimming their hopes. The maize stalks have withered, and each day, more keep succumbing. The maize wilted before even flowering.

Leaves of affected plants begin yellowing, and within weeks, the whole plant rots away. The disease spreads quite fast, and if no immediate measures are taken, locals fear that it might affect the whole county and spread to neighbouring Narok County.

District agricultural officer Josphat Kioko said he was working to ensure that an immediate solution was found. He said he had forwarded samples to Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) and Agri Quest, a Nairobi based private firm. But the results are conflicting, which has made it difficult to conclusively handle the situation.

Kari recommends that farmers uproot and burn the affected crops as well as keeping their farms weed-free, since weeds might host the fungus. It also advised farmers to sterilise farm implements after use.

Agri Quest, however, attributes it to _Meloidogyne_, a devastating pest that attacks crops. They also detected _Botrytis cinerea_, a common fungal disease that causes crop losses. They recommend that farmers uproot affected crops besides spraying them with fungicides.

Kioko says that his office is now at a crossroads on how to formulate a common policy.

According to a farmer, this is the 1st time he has seen anything similar in the last 10 years. Some farmers have been clearing diseased crops for planting alternative crops. The stalks are either given to livestock or sold as silage. This is, however, discouraged by the agriculturalists, who recommend that the farmers should completely destroy the crop, since the cause of the disease has not been established.

Since maize is the region's staple food crop, local leaders are now foreseeing a food crisis in the region if the status quo remains.

[A number of fungal diseases are known to affect maize, causing symptoms of yellowing, wilting and death of plants, like the ones described above. _Botrytis cinerea_ causes grey mould on a wide range of hosts, but in maize it is only considered a minor pathogen of ear rots. The identification of this fungus in the maize samples, as described above, is not sufficient to prove that it causes the problems.

Root knot nematodes of the genus _Meloidogyne_ attack a wide range of crops and cause significant economic losses. At least 8 of the species are known to affect maize. Symptoms may include stunting, wilting and leaf chlorosis, and large galls are formed throughout the root system affecting plant vigour and even killing the host. The pathogens can persist in the soil for years and are spread by plant material, soil, and mechanical means (for example contaminated equipment). Once they have been established in an area, it is difficult to control or eradicate them. Disease management requires an integrated approach including phytosanitary and cultural measures, nematicides, and use of resistant crop varieties.

It is certainly possible that a combination of pathogens, including nematodes and fungi, may cause the problems in the maize and that the 2 testing organisations have identified different components. Further work is obviously needed to identify the cause. Given the as yet uncertain diagnosis, both organisations have given sound advice on intermediate disease management measures, which should all be followed, since they are not mutually exclusive. There is really no "conflict", as claimed by the officer above, about what immediate action to take until a final diagnosis is available.
