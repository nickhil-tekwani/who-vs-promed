Emergency Operations Center (EOC) - situation report 9: cholera
outbreak in Haiti
----------------------------------------------------------------------
MSPP [Ministere de la sante publique et de la population/Ministry of
Public Health and Population] has not released new reports on cases.
The latest available data is for Sat 30 Oct 2010: 4764 cases and 337
deaths, reported in 4 different departments.

Health partners throughout Haiti are preparing for the possible
impact of tropical storm Tomas. The humanitarian community, including
PAHO/WHO, is coordinating with Haiti's Department of Civil Protection
(DPC). The contingency plan, which has been updated over the last 8
months to reflect the post-earthquake landscape, has been put into
operation. Health supplies that were part of the contingency plan are
being replenished. The Health Cluster will be represented at the
humanitarian operations center, if it is activated.

According to the latest advisory published by US NOAA's [National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] National Hurricane Center,
Tomas slightly weakened and reduced its intensity from a level 1
hurricane (Sun 31 Oct 2010) to tropical storm (Mon 1 Nov 2010). As of
5 PM EDT, Tomas is 640 km [398 mi] South-South West from
Port-au-Prince. According to current forecasts it may reach Haiti on
Fri 5 Nov 2010.

[Needless to say, a tropical storm or hurricane hitting Haiti would
be a disaster even without the earthquake. A strong storm with
flooding will be a major factor in further spread of cholera. The
storm can be tracked at
<http://www.weather.com/newscenter/hurricanecentral/2010/tomas.html>
and is predicted to regain hurricane strength while over the open sea
on Thu 4 Nov 2010 before striking Haiti. We await new official
numbers related to the outbreak. - Mod.LL]

Haiti: operational biosurveillance
----------------------------------
As of Fri 29 Oct 2010, PAHO has reported more than 4700 cases and
more than 330 fatalities (apparent case fatality rate approximately 7
percent). PAHO was unable to report updated statistics because MSPP
had not released them on Mon 1 Nov 2010. Statistics quoted by the
media over the weekend [30-31 Oct 2010] indicate fatalities
approaching 340. If approximately 25 percent of cholera cases are
clinically apparent, then a highly conservative estimate places the
true case count at nearly 19 000. We estimate the case counts to be
closer to 40 000 based on the level of under-reporting and rural
transmission occurring in areas not being serviced by responders.
Cholera epidemics often follow a waxing and waning pattern of
transmission and therefore can be unpredictable.

Key updates
-----------
Further evidence of cholera transmission in Cite Soleil has not been
reported, which is a key sentinel site for the greater Port au Prince
[PAP] area. Vigilance and sensitization for cholera in Cite Soleil
has been elevated to the maximum extent possible.

- we are aware of 12 confirmed cases of cholera reported within PAP
but not publicly reported by officials.
- suspect case samples have been sent from Leogane to LNSP [National
Public Health Laboratory] for processing, indicative of a high index
of suspicion and a highly sensitized local surveillance grid.
- field teams operating in Artibonite have reported back today [1 Nov
2010] that the true case counts are far higher than is officially
reported due to the following factors:
1. evidence of pervasive transmission throughout the Artibonite
region along rivers and tributaries. Seeding of tributaries has been
reported, which again strongly raises the question of ecological
establishment, and a "rolling" pattern of transmission from village
to village downriver has been reported.
2. rural community transmission is "off the grid" and communities
often have little to no access to safe drinking water or sanitation-
conditions that existed prior to the earthquake.
3. lack of appropriate infrastructure to support situational
awareness and strongly suspected political interference to report
accurate case counts.
4. little presence of public health officials or epidemiologists in
rural areas.

The Health Cluster has, to some degree of success, mobilized medical
response (Cholera Treatment Centers, CTCs) for key patient catchment
sites such as St Marc and Arachaie with surge capacity created in
PAP, Carrefour, and Leogane. However, rural transmission continues in
areas distant from these CTCs. Laboratory diagnostic capacity is
severely limited and localized to main patient catchment areas,
limiting an ability to rapidly confirm and plan intervention at sites
throughout the countryside. We recommend a high index of suspicion
and to not wait for official confirmation to respond.

Port-au-Prince and perhaps Leogane. Leogane is west of Port-au-Prince
and is located very close to the epicenter of the earthquake. - Mod.LL]

Some lengthy observations relevant to consideration of geo-spatial
spread during extended cholera outbreaks, gleaned from the sidelines
of other outbreak responses (from the perspective of an animal health
practitioner).

Cholera outbreaks occur predominantly in developing countries where
key factors invariably prevail:
- water supplies are unsafe or of unknown safety. This can include
urban, rural, and household supplies and cannot usually just be fixed
in an instant, if at all.
- sanitation is generally poor. There is often considerable
defecation on the surface of the ground and/or many toilets
contaminating water sources directly or after poor sewage treatment,
including in urban and rural areas. These too can be partially fixed,
but invariably not instantly.
- importantly, the informal economy revolving around street/roadside
selling of fresh produce (including fresh greens watered with
contaminated water, shellfish, and crustaceans) and cooked/processed
food is absolutely essential for basic livelihoods and food security,
particularly in urban and peri-urban environments. It is generally
not feasible (nor is it necessary) to ban informal street/roadside
selling of food for more than a very short time, and if that is
attempted the street/roadside selling usually just relocates into
less visible, often higher transmission risk areas and continues.
- importantly, movements of people and produce from rural
environments to urban and return is absolutely essential for daily
livelihoods and food security. It is generally not feasible to stop
free movements of people for disease control purposes without
creating a situation much worse than the disease.

Cholera is a dose-dependent disease. Contaminated water sources and
household hygiene and sanitation practices are usually the primary
drivers of outbreaks within affected areas. Common water sources
(such as rivers) and/or movements of infected people are usually the
primary drivers of geo-spatial spread between affected areas.

Persons who ingest a high dose of cholera organisms are liable to get
severe illness warranting rapid and aggressive rehydration therapy
(such as, after drinking from a grossly contaminated water supply or
failing to wash their hands after treating a sick relative and before eating).

Persons who ingest a low dose usually do not get ill or only get mild
illness that does not warrant intensive rehydration therapy (and
often goes unreported). Attention to personal hygiene is very
effective at reducing the dosage of exposure.

Infected persons shed cholera organism in their feces for variable
periods after becoming infected, ranging from days to a few weeks.
The "healthy" cases are not, however, as much infection risk
individually as severely affected cases (such as, cases that have
acquired infection elsewhere, moved to another location during the
short pre-patent period, and then become very ill after moving to the
new location), because ill cases shed vastly more cholera organisms
in their feces/diarrhea than "healthy" cases.

In situations where personal hygiene, food and water hygiene, and
sanitation are insufficient, "healthy" cases can, however, spread
cholera from household to household, place to place, etc.,
particularly when the number of humans moving from relatively badly
contaminated environs is relatively high. As outbreaks expand and
intensify, the environs become progressively more contaminated.

In cholera affected developing countries, it is not feasible to
prevent "healthy" or "incubating" cases from moving to other
locations, nor to prevent such cases from handling or preparing food
and drink for themselves or others (in their households or for sale
at street/roadside markets), nor to ban or eliminate street/roadside
selling of food. Control and management are, and must remain, the
operational principles for appropriate response.

In cholera response, a lot of emphasis is rightfully placed on
clinical case management through rapid, aggressive rehydration
therapy and infection control in and around treatment centers and
affected households. Effective rehydration treatment saves an immense
number of lives at relatively low individual cost. It is sometimes
quite challenging, however, especially if safe water supplies for
treatment centers are very limited in capacity or non-existent.

A lot of emphasis is rightfully placed on awareness, communications,
and IEC [information, education, and communication] targeting
affected communities and households. Boiling water renders it safe;
basic hygiene measures like washing hands, using toilets, basic
kitchen/food hygiene, and boiling of bedding materials prevent spread
from healthy and ill cases; cooking food and eating it while hot
eliminates cholera risk from food (including associated with
street/roadside markets), etc. These are simple and practical
solutions as long as people appreciate and adopt them as everyday
behaviors (usually much easier said than done).

A lot of effort is also rightfully placed on water and sanitation.
Containment of fecal material within toilets prevents spread to the
environment, then to water, hands and feet, then to water and food
supplies, then to people. Treatment of contaminated water supplies
renders water safe, such as, by boiling or, if the water source is
clear/non-turbid, by chlorination.

There are sometimes, however, some potential gaps in conventional
responses that target the above for affected communities. For
example, specifically targeting the "moving people" with information
(rather than unreasonable and impractical restrictions), and the
places that they congregate and the routes along which they move with
safe water supplies, ample sanitation, and hygiene could be very
beneficial to reduce geo-spatial spread from location to location.

Many of these people are moving from rural areas to urban and
peri-urban areas to sell produce, access essential services, etc.
They often live relatively rough for a period of up to days in the
urban environment and/or at staging points on the routes between
their home and the urban centers, then return to their rural homes.
If the cholera is in the rural areas it may be innocently carried
into the urban/peri-urban areas by them. Conversely, if cholera is in
the urban/peri-urban areas, they may innocently carry it back to the
rural areas.

In the rural areas:
- water supplies and sanitation are often considerably worse (or less
protected) than in the urban areas;
- rapid access to medical services for treatment is problematic,
- so occurrence of cholera is likely to be much more logistically
difficult and expensive to manage and have far greater adverse
impacts on affected communities; and
- once affected, cholera may be harbored long term at rural sites
and, thereby, present a reservoir that threatens population centers
longer term with reintroduction of infection and subsequent
geo-spatial spread from/via focal confluences.

In developing countries, the moving people usually congregate around
transport hubs, staging posts, and produce markets, some of which may
be associated with major national economic development projects such
as mine sites, etc. These are also key confluences for the rural,
urban and peri-urban populations and workforces, so serve as
potential foci for transmission between respective sub-populations
and different geo-spatial areas. It, therefore, makes sense to devote
considerable response attention to such places to reduce geo-spatial
spread risks.

Another potential gap may surround performance of funeral and burial
rites for victims of the disease. In many developing countries it may
be customary for funerals to be held at or nearby to the homes of the
deceased. Efforts to prevent potential spread around mourning and
burial rites by preventing the customary processes are invariably
problematical, can generate concerns and animosities that, in turn,
can result in concealment of illness and fatalities at community level.

In many instances, deceased victims of cholera acquired their
infection from a heavily contaminated source within or nearby to
their respective homes. Mourners are often housed temporarily and fed
and sustained at these places for a relatively brief period before
returning to their respective homes, so the custom of conducting
mourning at the same location can expose mourners to the same source
and thereby lead to significant geo-spatial spread when the mourners
return to their respective homes. It, therefore, makes sense to
modify customary mourning and burial practices to reduce exposure
risk without offending custom and, especially, to ensure safe water
and food supplies for all mourners during mourning.

Finally, another consequence occurs in coastal areas where
generalized, stand-alone advice is often given to the effect that
seafood may be contaminated when, in fact, all seafood is safe to
consume if it is cooked and consumed whilst still hot. It is,
however, true that cholera accumulates in shellfish and some
crustaceans in affected areas, but not necessarily all seafood such
as pelagic and finned fish harvested from offshore waters. It is also
true that shellfish and crustaceans harvested from, especially, the
intertidal zone, within estuaries, and adjacent to the shoreline of
affected areas present a grave risk if consumed raw and a further
risk if prepared without due care to food hygiene practices designed
to prevent cross-contamination between raw products and cooked foods.

The effect of generalized advice pertaining to seafood given in
isolation, however, is usually a severe slump in local seafood sales
and severe economic hardship for coastal communities that rely almost
entirely on fishing and trade in fisheries products into urban and
peri-urban areas. It may further result in quite major food security
issues within urban and peri-urban communities and/or coastal
villages if/when people who normally rely upon seafood as their
principle source of protein, generally shun seafood, including when
it has been cooked.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Thomson for his commentary on cholera spread
in the developing world, which certainly applies to the current
situation in Haiti.

It is interesting to consider the concept of hyperinfectivity in _V.
cholerae_ in the potential of epidemics in cholera. It has been
reported that, not only is the infectious dose to infect 50 percent
of persons (ID50) lowered when there is low or no stomach acid,
strains of _V. cholerae_ also transiently become more infectious
after passed through a human host (1,2) and this effect is maintained
for at least 5 hours in pond water at room temperature. If this is a
common phenomenon, it may well be a factor in causing epidemics.
