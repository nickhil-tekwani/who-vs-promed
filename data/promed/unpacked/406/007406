State health department and hospital officials say 7 patients had confirmed cases of legionnaires' disease apparently linked to _Legionella_ bacteria at the new USD 361 million hospital that opened on [28 Apr 2019]. One of the patients died [Sun 2 Jun 2019]. [3 more legionnaires' cases were reported at Mount Carmel Grove City Hospital on 4 Jun 2019 (https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190604/three-more-legionnaires-cases-reported-at-mount-carmel-grove-city-hospital). Franklin county has the highest number of _Legionella_ bacteria cases in Ohio, stats show (https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190603/franklin-county-has-highest-number-of-legionella-bacteria-cases-in-ohio-stats-show).]

_Legionella_ bacteria can be found naturally in water, but when they spread into building water systems and places such as shower stalls, faucets, and drinking fountains, they can become a health concern. Breathing in airborne water droplets that contain the bacteria is the problem. People with weakened immune systems can be particularly vulnerable and develop legionnaires' disease.

The Ohio Department of Health said a number of things could be at fault to activate the bacteria in a water system: wrong water flows, improper temperatures, wrong pH levels, or incorrect chlorination. Testing is still being done at the hospital following a "hyper-chlorination" and flushing of the lines over the weekend [1-2 Jun 2019].

Hospital officials over the weekend said they have taken steps to protect patients, even as they await tests of the water systems to determine the source of the _Legionella_ bacteria. Dr Richard Streck, chief clinical operations officer, said on [Sat 1 Jun 2019] that officials were meeting with patients and their families to alleviate concerns.

Samantha Irons, a spokeswoman for the Mount Carmel Health System, said only one patient has transferred since the outbreak was announced [Fri 31 May 2019] and safeguards -- such as no showering and using only bottled water and bagged ice -- were put in place. The hospital on [Mon 3 Jun 2019] had 146 patients, which is a normal number, Irons said. 2 Mondays ago, patient count was 141.

Grove City, with a population of 41 495 in 2018, in Franklin county, is a suburb of Columbus, the capital of the state of Ohio (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grove_City,_Ohio). A map showing the location of Grove City can be found at https://goo.gl/maps/YWeUruqtXMnQ1UyM9.

Genotyping the clinical isolates from cases of legionnaires' disease will help to establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, the prior ProMED-mail post concerning this outbreak said that the diagnoses for the 1st 7 cases were confirmed through urine antigen testing, which only detects _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen. If the last 3 cases were also similarly diagnosed through urine antigen testing, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. - Mod.ML]
