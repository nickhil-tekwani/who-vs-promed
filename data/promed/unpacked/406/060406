Cat Becomes 1st Mammal to Die of Bird Flu in Korea
--------------------------------------------------
The 1st bird flu infection of a mammal in Korea was confirmed on
Monday [28 Jul 2008]. The Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry
and Fisheries announced that the National Veterinary Research and
Quarantine Service confirmed that the cause of death of a cat found
dead in marshland along the Mangyeong River in Gimje, North Jeolla
Province, in late April [2008] was a highly pathogenic strain of bird
flu virus, H5N1.

The College of Veterinary Medicine at Chungnam National University
asked the national quarantine service to verify the exact cause of
death. The Ministry said unlike poultry, cats do not transfer the
highly pathogenic strain to humans. The virus found in the cat was
the same strain that killed thousands of poultry in April.

"The virus discovered in poultry in April can infect mammals, but the
kind has never been found to infect humans," said Joo Yi-Seok, head
of the Department of Animal Disease Control at the NVRQS. "Because
cats do not have a strong enough system to reproduce the bird flu
virus in their bodies, there is no risk of cats spreading the virus.
There is no known case around the world of humans being infected with
the virus by cats."

[Though this event took place 3 months ago, we post it in view of the
following comment from the rapporteur, for which we are grateful: "It
is new taxon record for Korea, and is of interest because most
research indicates a separate H5N1 clade is circulating there than in
other places where cat mortality has been reported (Iraq, Austria,
Thailand, etc)." -Mod. AS].

[The following information is derived from an update of CIDRAP News,
dated 25 Jul 2008:
"On 27 Jun 2006, veterinary officials detected the virus in a chicken
at a live bird market in Kebbi state, in northwestern Nigeria. On 19
Jul 2008, animal health workers found the virus in a duck at a live
bird market in Gombe state in the east-central part of the country.
The reports did not say if bird deaths were reported in the area or
if the birds that were sampled appeared sick. A detailed
investigation was under way to determine the source of the virus,
which might be contact between poultry and wild birds. Officials said
they have restricted the movement of birds inside the country and
have disinfected the areas where the birds were kept.

Nigeria's last H5N1 outbreak occurred in October 2007, according to
an overview from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO). See at
<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/jul2508birds-br.html>."

The above CIDRAP News information on the 2 new outbreaks is based
upon a day earlier (24 Jul 2008) immediate notification of Nigeria to
the OIE, which can be seen at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7217>,
including a map.

Concluding, it appears that at least 4 H5N1 outbreaks, in 4
different, distant Nigerian states, have been recorded since the end
of June 2008. Nigeria's previous reported outbreak dates back to
January 2008. - Mod.AS]

UK: 'Bernard Matthews halts sale of foreign-raised turkeys'
-----------------------------------------------------------
Bernard Matthews Foods is to stop selling turkeys raised outside the
UK, a move designed to address concerns that its outbreak of bird flu
2 years ago may have been caused by infected birds imported from
sub-contractors in Hungary.

Jeremy Hall, who coordinated the company's response, said "many
learned people had their doubts" that the virus was imported in
carcasses or equipment travelling from Hungary to its plants in East
Anglia, but the move "removes any potential risk."

The decision, which affects less than 2 percent of the birds sold by
the company, is one of a number of initiatives taken in response to
the H5N1 outbreak that triggered widespread culling and damaged
Bernard Matthews' sales and reputation.

Mr. Hall, who recently gave a presentation on the subject to the food
industry, warned that bird flu in animals could become an annual
event in Europe. He called on policymakers to strengthen cross-border
exchange of information. He said reduced purchases of imported meat
could help cut the risk of infection, but argued there was evidence
the virus spread through wild migratory birds.

In spite of recent improvements, he said it could take 2 months
before European Union countries identifying a bird flu outbreak
provided the information to a central database available to industry.
He argued that following infection reports elsewhere in Europe, the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) should be
more willing than it is now to announce "housing orders," which allow
poultry breeders to bring birds indoors for several weeks to keep
them safe without losing the right to label them free range.

Mr. Hall said DEFRA remained reluctant to make such orders unless
there were infections in the UK, France or the Netherlands, and was
sceptical it would unveil any change in policy ahead of Christmas. He
said officials had refused to allow workers culling birds at Bernard
Matthews' plant to wear full face masks, encouraging them to switch
to less practical goggles in spite of written instructions to the
contrary.
