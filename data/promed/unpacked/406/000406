RHDV2 has recently been confirmed in a domestic rabbit in Custer County. According to a release from South Dakota's State Veterinarian, this is the first confirmed case in domestic rabbits in the state.

Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus 2 is an infectious viral disease of rabbits killing 80 to 100% of infected animals. RHDV2 does not affect humans or other animals.

Rabbit owners who have questions should contact their veterinarian. Anyone suspecting the disease in rabbits should notify the South Dakota State Veterinarian's office at 605-773-3321. For more information, visit https://aib.sd.gov/RHDV2.html.

"Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus 2 (RHDV2)

"Since 2019, Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus Type 2 (RHDV2) has been emerging in the United States. RHDV2 is a highly contagious and fatal disease of domestic and wild rabbits of the genus _Oryctolagus_. As the virus continues to spread veterinarians and rabbit producer should be aware of the disease risk.

"Biosecurity Recommendations
---------------------------
Rabbit owners should practice the following biosecurity recommendations, whether they have commercial or pet rabbits:

- Keep rabbits indoors if possible.
- Have indoor and outdoor footwear; don't wear outdoor shoes indoors and vice versa.
- Wash hands before and after handling or caring for rabbits.
- Clean and disinfect feeders and other equipment daily if possible. Clean with soap and water, rinse well, spray with or submerge in 10% bleach for 10 minutes, rinse well, and let dry before re-use.
- Control flies, rats, cats, dogs, birds, etc. that can move the virus around on their feet or body.
- Don't allow visitors who also have rabbits.
- Don't handle others' rabbits.
- Prevent contact with wild rabbits.
- Do not put rabbits down on the ground to eat grass, etc.
- Do not collect outdoor forage and browse to feed rabbits.
- Treats can include raw vegetables from grocery stores.
- Monitor your rabbits closely for going off feed, looking limp/depressed, or behaving differently in any way. Call your veterinarian as soon as possible if you notice signs of illness in your rabbit.
- Report all unusual mass morbidity (sickness) or mortality (death) events to the State Veterinarian's Office at 605.773.3321.

This disease can be very devastating to rabbit breeders and owners and even to wild rabbits. Take seriously this warning and institute the recommended measures very strictly.

In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus causing an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay, and Reunion Island.

RHD is a highly pathogenic lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America. The disease has also spilled into wild cottontail rabbits and jackrabbits.

RHD is characterized by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90%) in European rabbits and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival, or oral routes.

Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. Lesions are primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea, and lungs.

In 2010, a new genotype of RHD (RHD-2) emerged, and where it propagated it replaced the original strain. This new variant causes lethal infections also in juvenile (under 2 months old) and RHD vaccinated rabbits. After its 1st detection in France, RHD-2 spread rapidly and infections were reported in several European countries, North America, the Middle East, and Australia.
