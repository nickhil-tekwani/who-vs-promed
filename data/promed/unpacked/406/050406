3 people and 130 cattle have succumbed to an anthrax outbreak that
has hit most parts of Masvingo Province in the past few weeks. The
dead are from Bikita, the worst affected area, where 14 livestock
deaths were reported. The resurgence of anthrax cases in both humans
and livestock has raised alarm bells in the Department of Veterinary
Services, which has expressed concern at the impact of the outbreak
on the province's beef herd. Acting provincial veterinary officer for
Masvingo Dr. Charity Sibanda yesterday [17 Nov 2005] confirmed the
anthrax-related deaths of the 3 people and scores of cattle in Bikita.
Dr. Sibanda said it was disturbing that the highly contagious disease
had resurfaced in Masvingo this year [2005] in the aftermath of a
massive anthrax outbreak last year, which almost decimated the
province's beef herd. "There has been an outbreak of anthrax in the
province over the past few weeks which has already claimed 3 human
lives and 14 livestock in Bikita. We suspect that most people who
were affected by the disease might have contracted it from biltong
made from beef from animals that died during last year's outbreak,"
said Dr. Sibanda.
She added that the outbreak had to date been reported in 6 districts,
namely Masvingo, Bikita, Zaka, Chivi, Gutu and Chiredzi. Zaka was the
worst affected in terms of livestock fatalities, with 64 cattle
having already succumbed to anthrax. In Gutu, the disease has claimed
32 cattle, while 17 cattle died in Masvingo district, with Chiredzi
and Chivi recording less than 10 deaths each.
Dr. Sibanda said the veterinary department did not have sufficient
stocks of anthrax vaccines to inoculate all the cattle. "We only have
enough stocks to cater for areas where outbreaks of the disease would
have been reported. We would have wanted to go on a wholesale
vaccination exercise of all the cattle in the province, but we cannot
do that because we do not have enough stocks to inject all the cattle
at once," said Dr. Sibanda.
Last year [2004], anthrax killed hundreds of cattle in Masvingo
Province. The disease has already severely dented Masvingo's efforts
to replenish its beef herd.

The water crisis that has gripped the whole country has continued. Experts say
that urgent solutions are needed. Animals are dying in the National Parks;
citizens are going without water for months.
According to the state paper The Herald, the National Parks and Wildlife
Management Authority has so far lost 99 animals at Hwange National Park. The
authority's public relations manager, Retired Major Edward Mbewe, told
journalists on Tuesday [15 Nov 2005] during a tour of the park that more than
40 elephants, 53 buffaloes, a giraffe, 3 zebras and 2 impalas had succumbed to
thirst and black leg, a disease that affects animals when the ground is too
dry. He also said his office had sent recommendations to the government
seeking authority to cull the elephants from 75 000 to "manageable figures."
Meanwhile, the Namibian government has rejected Zimbabwe's request to take
some of the country's starving elephants, saying it was already facing serious
problems with its own. Our correspondent, Warren Moroka, reports that
Zimbabwean deputy environment minister Andrew Langa had suggested that some of
the starving elephants in Hwange National Park could be moved to Namibia. But
Ben Beytell, the director of the country's parks and wildlife department, said
Namibia was also facing worsening serious water shortages and a lack of
grazing pasture for its 16 000-strong elephant population. He added that the
northern Caprivi Strip was already under siege from elephants escaping hunger
and drought in Botswana's Chobe National Park.
What has not been reported is how Dr. Beytell and Namibian
authorities feared receiving Zimbabwe's animals because they might be
diseased. Outbreaks of foot and mouth and anthrax have been common on
the Zimbabwe side, and Namibia did not want to take any chances.
Zimbabwe's neighbors are also experiencing water shortages, but they
are better prepared and well staffed. They also have the spare parts
for pumps and other irrigation equipment. In comparison, the Zimbabwe
government is literally broke, and animals are the least of its
concerns.
The parks department needs over ZWD 500 million [USD 7700] to
purchase a minimum of 5 new water engines in order to restore water
services in the park.
While the animals suffer, the water crisis has continued to
deteriorate in many towns around the country. The Herald reported
that some suburbs in Harare and its satellite towns will have water
cuts of up to 12 hours in every 48 hours. It says local authorities
and the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) have agreed to the
rotational cuts in order to cope, as demand exceeds the maximum
supply of 600 million liters a day. But these are not permanent
solutions. An injection of money is what is needed to fix and
maintain the infrastructure.

[In June 2005 I wrote: "With the ongoing government funding problems
in that country, the present disease situation can only continue or
get worse." It does not give pleasure to be proven correct in such a
prediction. Climatic stress reduces the innate resistance of
livestock (and humans) quite apart from the malnutrition and
starvation that occurs during droughts. The rainy season should have
terminated the earlier epidemic. It hasn't. Obviously, the rural
malnutrition will add to the probability, nay certainty, of people
eating dead animals. - Mod.MHJ]
