To date 13 people have become ill with salmonellosis from eating a raw Mexican-style cheese, queso fresco. Officials are warning people of the health risks of eating unpasteurized dairy products.

MDH [Minnesota Department of Health] has confirmed 11 cases of infection with _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium. 8 were hospitalized. Other family members became ill, and 2 were hospitalized. All have recovered. Unpasteurized queso fresco apparently came from someone who made it in a private home and then delivered it to others and may have sold it on a street corner near the East Lake Street area of Minneapolis. Anyone who may have the cheese should throw it away.

The Minnesota Department of Health, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, and the City of Minneapolis are investigating the outbreak and the source of the raw milk in the cheese.

Raw milk can contain pathogens that can cause serious illness, including _Campylobacter_, Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_, _Salmonella_, _Listeria_, and _Yersinia_. Pasteurization has been used for almost a century as a way to reduce diseases commonly caused by raw milk.

Minnesota law allows the purchase of raw milk directly from a farm for consumption, but it may not be distributed or sold off the farm. Additionally, cheese production facilities need to follow proper food safety laws and regulations, including licensure.

[Overall, in the USA, campylobacteriosis [not salmonellosis] has been the most common infection reported in ProMED-mail associated with unpasteurized dairy products. In addition to the zoonotic infections mentioned in the post, non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ species, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with raw milk ingestion. - Mod.LL
