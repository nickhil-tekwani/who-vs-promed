Chile registered 9 deaths of a rodent-spread hantavirus in 2009,
local health authorities said on Monday [4 Jan 2009]. The country
reported a total of 31 cases of hantavirus [infections] last year,
according to the Epidemiology Department of the Chilean Health
Ministry. The latest case was reported last Thursday [31 Dec 2009], a
44-year-old peasant in the central Maule Region. He is in stable
condition, the ministry said.

Chile launched a campaign last November [2009] to eradicate the
hantaviruses in bus stations across the country. It was believed that
tourists who went on vacation in rural areas were the major carriers
of the virus, which can cause a rare but potentially fatal flu-like
pulmonary syndrome. People infected with the virus may develop
symptoms of fever over 38.3 degrees C [101 degrees F], headaches and
gastrointestinal dysfunction.

Chile confirmed its 1st hantavirus case in the Metropolitan Region
last November [2009]. The patient was a 20-year-old female in Lampa.
She is now out of danger. The Epidemiology Department reported 43
hantavirus cases across Chile in 2008.

The department suggested residents "keep alert" against the disease
during the ongoing hantavirus high season. It also called for timely
hospitalization and appropriate medical treatment in the high-risk zones.

One way to prevent infection with the virus is that people who travel
to rural areas must open the doors and windows of a house 30 minutes
before entering it, the department said in a statement. The statement
gave other tips including keeping the floor clean and keeping rodents
from entering a house.

[Unfortunately, this report speaks of hantavirus as though there was
just one species of virus, when, in fact, there are many in South
America that infect humans. New World hantaviruses are carried by
sigmodontine rodents. Although this report does not specify which
hantavirus is involved in this case, the long-tail rice rat
(_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_) is likely to be the main hantavirus
vector in Andean Chile, and Andes virus is likely to be the
hantavirus responsible for these cases.
