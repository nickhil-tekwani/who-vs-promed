Experts said that chikungunya is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes and the major symptoms include high fever, joint pain, joint swelling, rash, headache, muscle pain, nausea and fatigue. Chikungunya is rarely fatal; the death rate of the disease-affected people is less than one per cent.

[The vector for both dengue and chikungunya is _Aedes aegypti_, which has been found in numerous districts and regions. This highlights the need for development and implementation of national and provincial short-term plans with a strong integrated vector management component to tackle all vector-associated diseases. This should be followed by long term strategic measures which build on existing strengths and resources through multi-sectoral coordination, as management of vector borne diseases requires efforts on improving patient surveillance and case management, vector control measures, and strong involvement of the social sector, and community awareness. - Mod.UBA
