[1] Cholera - Angola

More than 2760 people have died of cholera in Angola since an epidemic
broke out last February 2006, authorities said on Mon 15 Jan 2007. The
Health Ministry said in a report it had recorded more than 69 000 cases of
cholera and 2764 fatalities.
The epidemic, which started in Luanda, the capital, has spread to all but
one of the southwest African country's 18 provinces. Foreign aid agencies
have been distributing water dispensers, water purification tablets and
soap in affected areas.
Cholera is transmitted through contaminated water and is linked to poor
hygiene, overcrowding, and inadequate sanitation. Though it can be treated
easily, cholera is a major killer in developing countries. Angola's health
care and sanitation systems remain weak after a 2-decade civil war that
ended in 2002.

states that only one province has yet to be touched by the outbreak. Based
on previous ProMED-mail reports, both Lunda Sul and Moxico, in the eastern
part of the country, had been the only 2 provinces without cholera cases,
but the following post suggests Moxico has had cases. - Mod.LL]

[2] Cholera - Angola (Huambo)

Public health services of Huambo city have detected 10 new cholera cases in
the past 24 hours in various wards on the outskirts of the region, with no
fatalities, thereby raising the number of cases to 503, 35 of whom have
died, ANGOP has learned.
The cholera outbreak in Huambo city, in the central plateau region with the
same name, was officially declared on 24 Nov 2006, with the disease
affecting the outskirts of the area: Macolocolo, Kaquereuwa, Rua do
Comericio, Benfica, Belem do Huambo, Kanhe, Kapango, and the suburban areas
of Cruzeiro, Cacilhas and Santo Antonio.
Currently, 24 patients are hospitalized in the special cholera treatment
center in the regional hospital of Huambo, and the local health authorities
continue to consider the consumption of non-treated water and the poor
condition of drainage infrastructure to be the main causes of the spread of
the disease.
In the Angolan capital (Luanda), the cholera outbreak was officially
declared on 19 Feb 2006, with the 1st case having been identified on 13 Feb
2006, and later, it spread countrywide, initially through the coastal
regions of the country, and is currently affecting 17 provinces, with the
exception of northeast Lunda Sul province.

The New Year started in Arusha with fresh outbreaks of cholera, and by 8
Jan 2007, 8 victims had been admitted at Levolosi health center, which had
also been designated a cholera camp. The Municipal Medical Officer, Dr
Solomon Ole Logilunore told the Arusha Times that the epidemic was still a
threat in Arusha. Four cases were reported on 1 Jan 2007, 5 on 2 Jan, 6
patients on 5 Jan, 6 on 7 Jan and 4 on 8 Jan 2007, all coming from within
the municipality and the Arumeru areas bordering the municipality.
He mentioned the affected areas as being Mbauda, Unga Limited, Sokon One,
and Sombetini in the municipality, while the Arumeru areas are Olasiti,
Matevesi, FFU; Sanawari ya Juu, Ilboru and Ngaramtoni.
Dr Logilunore further explained that cholera claimed 3 lives out of the 300
cases that were attended to at Levolosi, Mount Meru hospital and Mkonoo
camps since the epidemic was 1st reported on 26 Oct 2006.
He said 191 out of the 300 cases came from the municipality, so the
municipal council should be working hard to control the epidemic by
improving hygiene in social and commercial centers. Centers targeted in the
hygiene improvement drive include schools, markets, bus stands, mosques,
churches and food and drinks service centers as well as the town pay toilets.

Every year, the onset of the rainy season triggers cholera outbreaks in
Zambia. On 15 Oct 2006, a cholera case was officially recorded at the
Lukanga fishing swamps in Mposhi District (Central Province). Though the
cases later increased, the situation was contained within the month without
any fatalities. Another case was reported on 30 Oct 2006 in Chiengi
District, Luapula Province, and by the end of November 2006, a cumulative
total of 115 cases and 5 deaths had been recorded.
Prior to the October 2006 outbreaks, another outbreak had occurred in
Lusaka, the capital city, after cases that had begun to be reported in
August 2005 had increased. As of 31 Jan 2006, 2415 cases (with 21 deaths)
had been recorded. By 5 Apr 2006, the total case number stood at 7615, of
which 5991 were recorded in Lusaka District alone.
The densely populated areas in the capital have very poor sanitation
conditions, making them prone to cholera outbreaks. By 7 Mar 2006, the
outbreak had affected 6 other provinces as follows: Central Province (443
cases), Copper Belt Province (233), Eastern Province (221), Luapula
Province (31), North-Western Province (2), and Southern Province (314).

Food poisoning struck some 60 people who were supposed to perform on Sun 14
Jan 2007 at a gala dinner for Asian leaders meeting in the central
Philippines, organizers said. The performers were rushed to various
hospitals in Cebu province, 585 km south of Manila, early on Sun 14 Jan
2007, after suffering from severe stomachaches, diarrhea, and vomiting.
Arnel Rivera, a doctor with the Philippine Department of Health, said the
victims began to suffer the symptoms late Sat 13 Jan 2007, after eating
their packed food during rehearsals. He said among those hospitalized were
2 international Filipino beauty queens.
The victims were among the performers at a gala show for leaders of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and their counterparts from
6 east Asian countries. They were discharged hours before the show,
according to Victoriano Lecaros, spokesman for the ASEAN summit.

At least 170 people were stricken by an outbreak of diarrhea caused by
contaminated water in the town of Aguinaldo in Ifugao province, the
Department of Health regional office reported yesterday, 24 Jan 2006.
The regional office said the victims ranged from 4 months to 70 years old,
and public health officials are urging the government to declare a state of
emergency to enable the authorities to deal with the problem.
Aguinaldo Mayor Federico Juguiad Jr. said that the outbreak started in
November 2006, after typhoons Paeng, Queenie, and Reming, and continued
until December 2006, purportedly because of contaminated water.
"We have already received information of a diarrhea outbreak, so we have to
act quickly to prevent further stress to the communities," the mayor said,
specifying the barangays of Awayan, Butac, Chalalo, Damag, Galonogon,
Monggayang, Pojnaan, and Ubao. Pojnaan has the highest number of cases.
Juguiad confirmed health department reports that water and sanitation in
the municipality is compromised by the lack of water resources.

An investigation is ongoing into the gastroenteritis outbreak that affected
more than 100 persons in Valencia d'Aneu between 23 and 24 Dec 2006.
There are indications of a possible spill of wastewater into the Bonaigua
River. Also, there may be deficient chlorination of drinking water in this
Alt Aneu area.
A survey by the Health Advisory Board showed that the gastroenteritis
outbreak affected about 65 per cent of the Valencia d'Aneu population and
might have been caused by the presence of a microorganism called _Shigella_
in the drinking water supply.
