An adult female Malaysian, a resident of Kobe in Japan for 3 years,
visited us to be evaluated for dengue fever like symptoms including
high fever, malaise and arthritis on 6 Jan 2009. She visited Malaysia
(Kuala Lumpur) from 19 Dec 2008-3 Jan 2009 (in the rainy season,
which is from December to February) and developed a high fever and
polyarthritis, predominately in both hands, feet and ankles on 5 Jan
[2009]. Large joints were less severely affected. Laboratory tests on
6 Jan [2009] showed negative results for IgM antibody for dengue
fever (PanBio Dengue), rapid influenza antigen test, malaria smear
and blood culture for salmonella typhi but positive IgG-dengue fever.

The serum was submitted for PCR assay to the National Institute of
Infectious Diseases in Tokyo, where it was determined to be positive
for chikungunya virus (CHKV) RNA. The titer of viral RNA was 6.7 x
10(7) copies/ml in the serum. IgM antibody against CHKV was negative
on 6 Jan [2009] and sero-converted to be positive on 15 Jan [2009].
IgM antibodies against dengue virus (DENV) were negative in both
sera, and IgG antibodies against DENV were positive in both sera,
indicating she was infected with DENV previously.

Her fever, up to 40 C, subsided in 6 days; itchy skin rash appeared
on her extremities between the 6th day and 10th day, but arthralgia
has been persisting. No febrile illness manifested in other family
members, including spouse and 2 infants for 14 days after arrival in Japan.

Chikungunya fever is not a reportable infectious disease in Japan.
Since diagnostic tests for chikungunya are not available
commercially, diagnosis using PCR assay is made by arranged
submission of specimens to the limited institutes by clinicians.
Recently, several reports have warned that increased travel
associated with globalization may have led to the introduction of
chikungunya fever into non-endemic areas by travelers with viremia,
because of resident [populations of] _Aedes_ species [that are
chukungunya virus vectors. - Mod.TY]. Therefore, a reportable system,
announcements to clinicians, and easy access to the diagnostic tests
for febrile diseases should be promptly established in Japan.

[The last report of chikungunya virus infection in Malaysia was 17
Dec 2008 (see ProMED archive no. 20081217.3963). The above report
indicates that the outbreak continues. Dr. Yamamoto and colleagues
make an important point about the risk of chikungunya virus-infected
individuals introducing this virus into areas, even in subtropical
and more temperate zone localities, where competent vectors, such as
_Ae. albopictus_, are established, as happened in Italy (see ProMED
archive no. 20071210.3980). ProMED thanks Dr. Kouta Yamamoto and
colleagues for sending in this report. Firsthand reports from
individual and group health providers dealing with these cases are
especially valuable. - Mod.TY]
