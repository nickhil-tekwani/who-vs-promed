Cowpox has infected 37 people in Lagoinha, Sao Paulo state and
approximately 1500 head of cattle, with large pustules on the udders and on
the hands of the milkers [see photo at URL].
5 foci of cowpox, a non-fatal disease with no specific treatment, were
identified in this locality, which belongs to the dairy farming zone of Sao
Luiz do Paraitinga. Marly Ueda, a researcher at the Instituto Adolfo Lutz,
confirmed the presence of the virus, and a dermatologist at the Instituto
Butantan took samples from the 37 infected people, by which the antibodies
to the disease were found.
Cowpox is transmitted between cattle when calves suckle infected udders,
and from them to humans by contact when milking, producing the same
pustules on the hands and sometimes the ears, leaving scars. There may also
be swollen glands and fever. Without specific treatment, just antibiotics
to prevent secondary infection and fever medicines, the disease disappears
in 2 weeks, the time it takes for antibodies to appear.
Dermatologist Joao Luiz Cardoso, of the Butantan Institute, explained that
cowpox is an old problem in Brazil. It has been studied by the Biological
Institute since the 1930s, there was an epidemic a decade ago in the region
of Aracatuba, and cases in 1998 in Taboado, Mato Grosso state, and Rio
Vermelho, Goias state.
Recommended control measures are to wipe the udders with iodized alcohol
and wear rubber gloves when milking. The milk should be discarded.
Vaccine history
---------------
Cowpox was used as the first human vaccine against smallpox by the
researcher Jenner, in England. In the 18th century, when smallpox was
killing millions of people and was a serious problem even in Brazil, he
proved that English dairymaids who had contracted cowpox never caught
smallpox. He inoculated material from pustules on the cows into animals and
then humans, and found they became immune. The system was then used in
slaves in Brazil, by rubbing the infected arm of one slave against the arms
of others. After further refinement, the vaccine was so effective that
human smallpox became the first and thus far the only human disease to be
eradicated.

[For those who are interested in the history of Jenner's early vaccination
activities, a brief history plus 3 letters written by Jenner can be found
at: <http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1798jenner-vacc.html>
ProMED-mail reported on cowpox outbreaks in the Ukraine in 2001 and in Rio
de Janeiro (state) Brazil in 1998. On a side note, one wonders whether the
cessation of smallpox vaccination worldwide is or has been leading to an
increase in human cases of cowpox. - Mod.MPP]
[The identity of the virus in this report is unclear. Possibilities are
_Vaccinia virus_ or _Pseudocowpox virus_, both of which are widespread and
associated with disease in domestic animals and their handlers. Recently
Damaso et al. (Virology 277:439-49, 2000) described the biological
properties of poxvirus isolates from skin lesions on dairy cows and milkers
during recent exanthem episodes in Cantagalo County, Rio de Janeiro State,
Brazil. These isolates proved to be more similar to Vaccinia virus than
Cowpox virus. They named the virus Cantagalo virus and concluded that their
isolates represented a single strain derived from the Vaccinia virus used
as vaccine in Brazil.
The virus in question is unlikely to be _Cowpox virus_. The reservoir hosts
of Cowpox virus, despite its name, are a wide range of rodents. For
example, in the UK the reservoir hosts of cowpox virus are predominantly
bank voles, field voles, and wood mice. Cowpox virus has been found only in
Europe and adjacent regions of Russia. Cowpox virus occasionally spreads to
other animals, including domestic cats, cattle, humans, and a variety of
zoo animals (predominantly felids). Currently infection with cowpox virus
is more commonly seen in domestic cats, from which it is occasionally
transmitted to humans. Indeed cowpox virus infection in cats can be a more
severe disease than in humans or cattle.
Poxviruses are subject to progressive evolution by mutation and
recombination. The cowpox virus of Jenner's time and the virus currently
designated cowpox virus cannot be identical. Indeed, cowpox lesion material
was gradually replaced over the years by other smallpox vaccine
preparations. The origin of the current smallpox vaccine, _Vaccinia virus_,
is obscure, and it may have evolved by recombination between Variola
(smallpox) virus, viruses from cowpox lesions, and rodent viruses such as
cowpox virus. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that _Camelpox virus_ rather
than Cowpox virus is the closest extant relative of Variola virus. - Mod.CP]
