A man has been flown from Cairns to Brisbane in a critical condition after testing positive to the diphtheria. The 27-year-old was flown to Prince Charles Hospital last night [Tue 23 Jan 2018], with Queensland Health confirming he was infected within Australia. The Cairns and Hinterland Hospital and Health Service are contacting all people the man was in contact with in an effort to trace the infection and prevent its spread. Health officials are at a loss as to how the man contracted the contagious and potentially life-threatening illness. A Department of Health spokeswoman said the man hadn't done any international travel recently.

It is understood he wasn't vaccinated against diphtheria, and health officials have stressed the importance of being immunized. The Department of Health rushed to find locals that may have come into contact with the man since he contracted the illness. A spokeswoman said several people were treated with vaccinations this morning [Wed 24 Jan 2018] a precautionary measure.

Cases of diphtheria are rare in Australia due to the introduction of an effective vaccine, but a century ago diphtheria was the most common infectious cause of death, according to Queensland Health. Outbreaks still occur in countries with low vaccination rates. In 2015, there were about 4500 cases worldwide, down from about 100 000 cases in 1980.

[Quite uncommon in the developed world, there have been several substantial outbreaks occurring in displaced or strife-affected populations including in Bangladesh and Yemen. ProMED thanks Dr. Thompson for this posting.

The following is extracted from http://www.medindia.net/patients/patientinfo/diphtheria.htm:

"Diphtheria takes its name from the Greek word dipthera meaning leather and was named in 1826 by French physician Pierre Bretonneau. This is because it refers to the leathery, sheath-like membrane that grows on the tonsils, throat, and in the nose. It was previously considered to be one of the most dreaded diseases, with frequent large-scale outbreaks in the New England colonies between 1735 and 1740. It was said that the disease killed as many as 80 percent of the children below 10 years of age. Diphtheria is otherwise called the "Strangling Angel of Children" and was a dreaded common childhood illness. Statistics show that in the 1920s, there were an estimated 100 000 to 200 000 cases of diphtheria per year in the USA, with 13 000 to 15 000 deaths."

The following was extracted from http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/dip.pdf:

"_C. diphtheriae_ is an aerobic Gram-positive bacillus. Toxin production (toxigenicity) occurs only when the bacillus is itself infected (lysogenized) by a specific virus (bacteriophage) carrying the genetic information for the toxin (tox gene). Only toxigenic strains can cause severe disease. Culture of the organism requires selective media containing tellurite. If isolated, the organism must be distinguished in the laboratory from other _Corynebacterium_ species that normally inhabit the nasopharynx and skin (such as diphtheroids). _C. diphtheriae_ has 4 biotypes: gravis, intermedius, mitis and belfanti. [The most severe disease is associated with the gravis biotype, but any strain may produce toxin.] All isolates of _C. diphtheriae_ should be tested by the laboratory for toxigenicity.

"Susceptible persons may acquire toxigenic diphtheria bacilli in the nasopharynx. The organism produces a toxin that inhibits cellular protein synthesis and is responsible for local tissue destruction and membrane formation. The toxin produced at the site of the membrane is absorbed into the bloodstream and then distributed to the tissues of the body. The toxin is responsible for the major complications of myocarditis and neuritis and can also cause low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) and protein in the urine (proteinuria). Clinical disease associated with non-toxin-producing strains is generally milder. While rare severe cases have been reported, these may actually have been caused by toxigenic strains that were not detected because of inadequate culture sampling.

"The incubation period of diphtheria is 2-5 days (range, 1-10 days). Disease can involve almost any mucous membrane. For clinical purposes, it is convenient to classify diphtheria into a number of manifestations, depending on the site of disease. The most common sites of diphtheria infection are the pharynx and the tonsils. Infection at these sites is usually associated with substantial systemic absorption of toxin. The onset of pharyngitis is insidious. Early symptoms include malaise, sore throat, anorexia, and low-grade fever. Within 2-3 days, a bluish-white membrane forms and extends, varying in size from covering a small patch on the tonsils to covering most of the soft palate. Often by the time a physician is contacted, the membrane is greyish-green, or black if bleeding has occurred. There is a minimal amount of mucosal erythema surrounding the membrane. The membrane is adherent to the tissue, and forcible attempts to remove it cause bleeding. Extensive membrane formation may result in respiratory obstruction.

"The patient may recover at this point; or if enough toxin is absorbed, develop severe prostration, striking pallor, rapid pulse, stupor, and coma, and may even die within 6 to 10 days. Fever is usually not high, even though the patient may appear quite toxic. Patients with severe disease may develop marked edema of the submandibular areas and the anterior neck along with lymphadenopathy, giving a characteristic "bull neck" appearance.

"Most complications of diphtheria, including death, are attributable to effects of the toxin. The severity of the disease and complications are generally related to the extent of local disease. The toxin, when absorbed, affects organs and tissues distant from the site of invasion. The most frequent complications of diphtheria are myocarditis and neuritis. Myocarditis may present as abnormal cardiac rhythms and can occur early in the course of the illness or weeks later, and can lead to heart failure. If myocarditis occurs early, it is often fatal. Neuritis most often affects motor nerves and usually resolves completely. Paralysis of the soft palate is most frequent during the 3rd week of illness. Paralysis of eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm can occur after the 5th week. Secondary pneumonia and respiratory failure may result from diaphragmatic paralysis. Other complications include otitis media and respiratory insufficiency due to airway obstruction, especially in infants."
