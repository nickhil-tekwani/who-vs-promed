Wilt disease suspected in Madison corn crop
-------------------------------------------
Growers are waiting for confirmation that Goss's wilt disease has been found in some corn fields in Madison Parish. LSU [Louisiana State University] AgCenter's Clayton Hollier says that, if confirmed, it would be the 1st case of the disease in Louisiana.

Samples taken in June [2013] from corn fields in Madison Parish had classic leaf symptoms and disease spread pattern of Goss's wilt in the corn hybrid DK 6694, he says. In 2011 there were reports of Goss's wilt in northeast Louisiana, but investigators found the real problem was fertilizer burn, herbicide burn, and impact of drought conditions.

The field in Madison Parish has been isolated. Hollier is awaiting positive identification of what is ailing the crop there.

[Goss's wilt (GW) and blight of maize is caused by the bacterium _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _nebraskensis_. It is a persistent and economically serious disease of susceptible maize hybrids in several states of the USA. In 2009, it was reported for the 1st time outside the US, from Canada (ProMED-mail post 20100820.2901).

The bacterium can also affect some grasses, which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms may include systemic wilting of plants, leaf lesions, blighting and leaf necrosis, reduction of ear size, or even death of plants. Infection of leaves, stems, and roots occurs primarily through wounds (mechanical, hail, or insect damage), and plants are susceptible at all growth stages. The pathogen is seed transmitted and overwinters on crop debris and maize kernels. Disease management includes cultural practices to minimise inoculum, crop rotation, and use of resistant crop varieties.

A rapid spread of Goss's wilt in recent years (see map below) is causing concern in the US. The reasons for the increased rate of spread are still unknown, but the possibility of an emerging new strain is being considered (see ProMED-mail post 20110921.2865). If the presence of GW can be confirmed in Louisiana, it would be the southernmost report of the disease in the country so far.

Other subspecies of _C. michiganensis_ affecting different hosts are found elsewhere, including _sepedonicus_ (potato ring rot) and _michiganensis_ (bacterial canker of tomatoes), which can cause severe yield losses on their respective hosts.
