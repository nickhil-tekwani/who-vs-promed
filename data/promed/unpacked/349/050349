2 outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in farm geese, Hungary, January 2007
-----------------------------------------------
[By the Editorial team, Eurosurveillance editorial office]
1. 1st outbreak
On 21 Jan 2007, an increase in deaths among geese at a farm near
Lapisto village (Csongrad county in southern Hungary) was reported to
the Hungarian veterinary authorities. The breeding flock consisted of
3355 birds. 2 birds died on 19 Jan 2007, 8 on 20 Jan, and 18 on 21
Jan 2007. During an investigation at the farm on 21 Jan, more than 30
birds with neurological symptoms were discovered. On 22 Jan, 29 more
deaths in this flock were registered in the morning and a further 33
during the day. [1,2] [For the above and further references, please
refer to the original at the above URL. - Mod.AS]
The following measures were taken to contain the outbreak:
- On 22 Jan 2007, 5 dead geese were sent to the national reference
laboratory for further analysis.
- On 23 Jan 2007, all 3265 birds on the farm were culled (90 died in
the outbreak), and the farm was disinfected.
- A 3-km protection zone and 10-km surveillance zone were set up
around the affected farm. There are no settlements within one km
distance from the farm, but there are 57 households with backyard
poultry (1743 birds) within the 3-km zone, and a further 1253
households with backyard poultry (29 590 birds) and 8 large farms
with around 47 000 birds within the 10-km zone.
- All domestic birds within the 2 zones were examined.
- The European Commission was informed of the suspected outbreak of
avian influenza.
On 24 Jan 2007, the national reference laboratory announced that the
samples collected from dead geese at the Lapisto farm contained the
highly pathogenic A/H5N1 virus. These findings were confirmed on 30
Jan 2007 by the European Union reference laboratory in Weybridge,
United Kingdom.
On 23-24 Jan 2007, regional public health authorities assessed the
possible risk of exposure of poultry workers [3]. One person who had
worked closely with the birds but had not worn protective overalls
was offered and accepted chemoprophylaxis immediately. A further 11
people who had been involved in culling the birds received medication
after the virus was identified, because although they had been given
all the necessary protective equipment (a Tyvec overall with
headwear, rubber boots, heavy duty rubber work gloves, and a
respiratory protective device with FFP3 filter), they had not
observed all the recommended hygiene rules, and the possibility that
they had been exposed to the virus could not be excluded. There have
been no reports of illness in people who were potentially exposed.
2. 2nd outbreak
On 25 Jan 2007, veterinary authorities were notified of another
possible outbreak of avian influenza at a goose farm in Derekegyhaza,
9 km from the site of the 1st outbreak. The flock consisted of 6000
4-week-old and 3386 8-week-old geese. On 23 Jan, 6 geese died; the
following day the number of deaths was 24, on 25 Jan 21, on 26 Jan
289. By 27 Jan 2007, altogether 2596 geese died in the outbreak, the
remaining 6790 geese were culled. In addition, in order to control
the outbreak, a further 367 birds which were found in 4 households
within 1-km distance from the outbreak were also culled.
On 30 Jan 2007, the Hungarian national reference laboratory confirmed
that the outbreak at Derekegyhaza farm was also caused by the highly
pathogenic A/H5N1 virus.
In consequence of the 2nd outbreak, the A zone was modified to
include the 3- and 10-km zones around both outbreak sites. Since 29
Jan 2007, clinical examination of poultry found within the A zone and
laboratory testing of samples has been carried out. In one sample
taken from a goose, the presence of A/H5 antibodies was asserted.
Although none of the 4500 geese kept at the farm where this sample
was taken displayed any symptoms, the entire flock was culled on 7
Feb 2007.
Three poultry workers who were employed at the farm in Derekegyhaza
were offered and accepted chemoprophylaxis. No medication was given
to the 21 people brought in to assist in the culling of birds,
because they had used protective equipment correctly and it was
highly likely that they had not been exposed to infection. They are,
however, being monitored, and there are no reports of illness so far.
There will also be a serological follow-up of all people who were
potentially exposed during these outbreaks. [3]

Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (A/H5N1) in commercial
poultry in Hungary and the UK; public health implications?
-----------------------------------------------
[By the Influenza Team, the European Centre for Disease Prevention
and Control, Stockholm, Sweden]
1. The recently reported outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian
influenza (HPAI) due to influenza type A/H5N1 in Hungary and then the
United Kingdom (UK) have caused considerable disquiet and interest in
the agriculture industry and the media [1,2]. [For these and the
following references, refer to the original at the above URL. -
Mod.AS]
The outbreaks in January 2007 on geese farms in the village of
Lapisto (Csongrad county in southern Hungary) and then in
Derekegyhaza, 9 km from the 1st outbreak, were not much of a
surprise, as there had been outbreaks in 2006 in Hungary linked to
wild birds [1,3]. The more recent outbreak on a large turkey farm in
the UK (in Suffolk, southeast England) is the 1st to have occurred in
the country, and so attracted more attention. It was initially
suggested that wild birds were the source in the UK. If true, this
would have been evidence for the possibility that, rather than being
confined to wild birds in specific areas, the virus might once again
have become widely disseminated in wild bird populations across the
European Union (EU). This would have meant an increased health threat
to poultry in the EU, particularly for small backyard flocks because
of the difficulties of maintaining separation of wild birds and
poultry. Due to the close contact between birds and backyard flock
owners, the owners may also have been at a limited risk of infection
[4,5].
However, the birds on the affected UK farm were housed in an enclosed
biosecure unit with limited possibilities for contact with wild birds
[2]. Additionally, the EU's extensive wild bird surveillance has not
detected any positive H5N1-infected wild birds for several months (a
very different situation from the early months of 2006) [6] [see
comment]. If the virus is present in wild bird populations within the
EU, there is no evidence that it was widely disseminated.
The H5N1 specimens from affected birds in Hungary and the UK were
sent to the EU Community Reference Laboratory for testing and genetic
sequencing, where the genomes of the viruses from Hungary and the UK
were found to be 99.96 percent similar [7]. The possible link between
the 2 outbreaks is now the subject of intense investigation by EU,
Hungarian and UK veterinary authorities to determine whether and how
transfer could have taken place in either direction.
2. Protecting poultry and culling team workers a priority for health
authorities
EU legislation requires that, following notification of a suspicion
of an outbreak of a highly pathogenic avian influenza of any type,
rapid containment measures are applied in the affected premises,
including the culling of the flocks [8]. This was done in both
Hungary and the UK [1,2]. In the UK, a large number of temporary
workers were brought in quickly to manage the culling and disposal of
over 160 000 birds. Applying the ECDC recommended precautions to
protect the health of these poultry workers was highly
labor-intensive for authorities. Workers need to be advised and
instructed in use of personal protective equipment and offered
antivirals [9]. This should happen before the urgent culling and
disinfection work is carried out, after which the workers have to be
followed up.
In 2003, there was a single fatal human case of influenza A/H7N7
infection (another highly pathogenic avian influenza virus) in a
veterinarian in the Netherlands who was involved in controlling an
outbreak on a farm. The patient had not taken measures to protect
himself from infection [10]. This case and some milder illness in
cullers and their families during the same outbreak demonstrated the
necessity of stringent protective measures for people who have close
contact with sick and recently dead birds affected by any highly
pathogenic avian influenza [9]. The infection risk to culling teams
from A/H5N1 is considered very low because, worldwide, there has not
yet been a reported case of H5N1 disease in a poultry worker through
occupational exposure, although there have been some occasional
seroconversions observed among poultry workers in Asia [11].
There were a few coincidental mild respiratory infections among some
of those involved in the control operations in the UK (influenza
indices are increasing at present in parts of the EU), and there was
concern that these symptoms could have indicated human H5N1
infections. Application of the national clinical algorithms
determined that the cases did not fit many criteria but the patients
were still tested for H5N1 and found to be negative [12,13].
3. Almost non-existent risk to general public - low but real risk for
poultry owners in Europe
The risk to the general public from H5N1 in general and specifically
from consuming meat and poultry products has been repeatedly
considered to be minimal by authorities such as the ECDC, the
European Food Safety Authority, the World Health Organization
International Food Safety Authorities Network
(<http://www.who.int/foodsafety/fs_management/infosan/en/>)
and national food safety agencies within the EU [16,17]. Guidance
from these authorities always emphasizes the importance of cooking
and food hygiene, but this is mostly to protect against other
pathogens (_Campylobacter_, _Salmonella_ and _E. Coli_ O157) that are
more common, better adapted to humans and much more infectious [18].
As for the possibility of H5N1 transfer in or on unprocessed food or
fomites such as packing or clothing, the potential occupational
health risk to workers in the food industry and those preparing food
in the home and catering is currently being assessed but is believed
to be very low, as the virus remains poorly adapted to humans.
If there has been transfer of the H5N1 virus via poultry products or
fomites (and at this stage these are only 2 of the possible options),
this could mean more outbreaks within the EU. The threat would mainly
be to the agriculture industry, but this could also cause
considerable work for health authorities. Reduction in the already
low risk to human health in Europe rests mainly on the stringent
application of EU veterinary controls and application of biosecurity
measures in every EU country that will prevent the virus getting into
domestic poultry [19].
Owners of small flocks have previously been assessed to be at low but
real risk from A/H5N1 infection. These people still need to take the
recommended precautions to protect their own and their family's
health (H5N1 is not the only potential infection health risk posed by
birds) [See item 3 further]. But the best defense for human health
against the H5N1 influenza virus remains prevention and control of
infection in poultry flocks.

[EU's ADNS tables on avian influenza surveillance in wild birds for
2006 and the new table for 2007 [as of 5 Feb 2007] have been updated
earlier this week
(<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/adns/index_en.htm>).
No positive case has been found in the 14 surveyed countries since
the 2nd week of August 2006. In order to evaluate the significance of
the results, it would help to know how many wild birds have been
tested in each of the countries since August 2006. - Mod.AS]

Key messages to poultry owners - 2006
---------------------------------------------
ECDC Recommended Advice to people who keep domestic birds (chickens,
ducks or geese) near where they live.
Protecting your birds against avian influenza:
- Ask the local veterinary authorities for advice on the level or
risk in your area and on the measures they suggest to minimize the
possibility of your birds being infected.
Protecting yourself and your family:
- Do not allow your birds into the house.
- Discourage children from playing with the birds. Forbid children
from touching sick or dead birds. Teach them to tell adults quickly
if birds are sick.
- Make sure that children always wash their hands before eating.
- If you notice sick or dead birds in your flock, do not touch the
birds yourself. Inform the veterinary authorities as soon as you can.
- If it is not possible for the veterinarian to come quickly and you
have to take care of sick birds yourself, put on protective clothing:
- a gown or apron covering your body
- a hat covering your hair
- a mask or wet cloth over your mouth and nose
- goggles or glasses
- gloves
- boots
- If you need to dispose of a dead bird, use gloves and a mask, bury
it in a place which does not pose a risk to drinking water wells and
other water sources. If you have many dead birds to dispose of, or if
you have questions regarding the disposal of the dead birds, contact
the government veterinary services.
- After any contact with sick or dead birds, take off the clothes,
hat, face covering, mask etc. you were wearing and clean them using a
disinfectant. Wash your hands thoroughly before you touch anything
else.
- Humans get infected through contact with sick birds, their
droppings or other fluids and body parts (for example, blood, guts
and feathers). Cages, shed equipment or places where infected birds
have been kept can be infectious for several days.
- Use acidic disinfectants such as peroxide acid (e.g. Virkon S), a
blend of organic acids (such as Farm Fluid S), glutaraldehyde
(Parvocide Plus) and iodine compounds to disinfect cages, clothes or
equipment that has been in contact with infected birds. If these are
not available, use bleach.
- Do not eat sick birds or birds that have died from disease even if
they are cooked, and do not feed them to other animals or birds.
- Meat and eggs from healthy birds are safe provided you cook them thoroughly.
If there have been sick birds in your flock and someone in the family
becomes ill with fever, cough or a sore throat, contact a doctor
immediately, and let them know what has happened.

Some poultry culled in Bangkalan, Madura
-----------------------------------------------
Some 50 poultry were culled in Bangkalan, Madura Island, East Java
Province, following a finding of bird flu (Avian Influenza/AI) virus
infection in the area recently. [See map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/ID/8/Bangkalan.html>.
- Mod.AS]
"The poultry culling is aimed at stopping the bird flu virus from
spreading to wider areas," Head of the Bangkalan Health Service Dr.
Fahrurrozi said here [Bangkalan, Madura Island, East Java Province]
on Thu 15 Feb 2007.
Bangkalan District Head Fuad Amin Imron has called for efforts to
control bird flu virus by culling poultry within a radius of 100
meters from the location where the bird flu infection was detected
earlier.
There is no human infected with bird flu virus in Bangkalan so far,
but the district has intensified surveillance by spraying
disinfectant in poultry breeding areas and launching a public
awareness campaign on the deadly disease.
The local administration has provided compensation worth Rp 40 000
[USD 4.42] for each animal being culled.
A total of 10 nations have detected outbreaks of the animal disease
in humans. Indonesia has verified more human cases of H5N1 infection
than any other country in 2006. Of around 80 cases confirmed in
Indonesia, 62 have been fatal.
Like the vast majority of other human cases detected throughout the
region, contact with ailing chickens around households is the
apparent means by which the latest human cases occurred.
An Indonesian official announced recently that the Indonesian
government would allocate USD 61 million for an anti-bird flu drive
next year [2008], an increase from the USD 55 million it budgeted
this year.
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has instructed all regional
authorities to promptly provide compensation funds to people and
farmers whose poultry have to be culled to fight bird flu.
The President said Indonesia had come into the world's spotlight
because it was supposed to be able to do more to fight the bird flu
virus.
