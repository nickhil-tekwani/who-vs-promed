One of 3 cases of highly contagious dog flu confirmed by a lab at the
University of California, Davis, (UC Davis) was found in a San Francisco
puppy, veterinary researchers announced Friday.
A lab at UC Davis detected canine influenza virus in dogs from 3 states
using a new test that employs DNA technology to provide rapid, accurate
diagnosis of the highly contagious disease.
Since November 2005, scientists have tested more than 100 samples from dogs
suspected of having canine influenza. All of the samples turned out to be
negative until 23 Feb 2006, when the first of the 3 positive samples was
diagnosed.
That first case involved a fatal outbreak of disease in a Colorado animal
shelter. It was followed by a case in San Francisco, in which an imported
puppy became ill but recovered, as did its household-mates.
The 3rd case involved a fatal outbreak in a Florida animal shelter.
"There is no reason for dog owners to panic over the confirmation of these
cases," said Christian Leutenegger of the UC Davis School of Veterinary
Medicine. "Any dog that exhibits upper respiratory symptoms, such as a
persistent cough or nasal discharge, should be routinely examined by a
local veterinarian."
Dog flu is an upper respiratory disease, first reported in January 2004 in
racing greyhounds at a Florida racetrack.
To date, antibodies to canine influenza virus have been detected in dogs in
animal shelters, adoption groups, pet stores, boarding kennels and
veterinary clinics in 19 states.
Dogs can also catch the virus from saliva or mucus on shared toys or food
dishes.
There is no evidence that canine influenza can be passed to humans,
according to UC Davis researchers.
Since the dog flu virus is just emerging, dogs have no natural immunity to
it, researchers say. They add that all dogs exposed will become infected,
and roughly 80 percent of infected dogs will develop symptoms of the
illness. About 5 to 8 percent of all infected dogs will die, according to
UC Davis researchers.
There is currently no vaccine available for canine influenza.

[It should be noted that this disease is only fatal to a small percentage
of those canines infected. Hopefully, a vaccine will be developed soon.
However, it is likely that where numbers of dogs are gathered, such as in
animal shelters, we may see numbers of those animals affected by this
virus. - Mod.TG]
