Malt-O-Meal president John Lettman said that an oven that broke down at a
Malt-O-Meal plant is a possible source for an unusual type of salmonella
that might have contaminated a breakfast cereal and caused illnesses in 12
states. He said the oven broke down in early April on a toasted oat cereal
line and may have allowed a liquid vitamin spray to spoil the cereal but he
backed down from a statement earlier in the day that the spray was the
likely source.
He was quoted as saying, "They're checking out the whole line, and [the
vitamin spray is part of the system. It is a possible source. It would not
be accurate to say that it was a probable source or that it is the only
thing that is being checked out." The Minneapolis-based company recalled up
to 3 million pounds of cereal nationwide Friday as a precaution after the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found some of its
toasted oat cereal was the likely culprit in 188 cases of food poisoning.
Grocers were asked to pull Malt-O-Meal brand plain Toasty-Os and Toasted
Oats, as well as plain toasted oat cereals sold under 38 other brand names,
from their shelves. According to the article, Illinois was the hardest-hit
state in the salmonella outbreak, with 46 cases since April 1. The article
also noted that investigators from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
and the CDC have been investigating the company's Northfield, Minn., plant
since Thursday and Minnesota Department of Health spokesman Buddy Ferguson
said it could be some time before a source is pinpointed.

Salmonella reportedly confirmed in unopened boxes of cereal
Laboratory tests have confirmed the presence of Salmonella bacteria in
boxes of toasted oat cereal made by Malt-O-Meal Inc., the Saint Paul
Pioneer Press reported Tuesday. Investigators still don't know how the
bacteria got into the cereal but the find proves the company produced
contaminated cereal, the newspaper quoted unidentified sources as saying.
The Minneapolis-based company voluntarily recalled up to 3 million pounds
of its plain toasted oat cereal Friday after the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention found it was likely that some of the company's
toasted oat cereal was the source in 188 cases of food poisoning in 11
states. No deaths have been reported.
Grocers were asked to pull Malt-O-Meal brand plain Toasty-Os and Toasted
Oats from their shelves, as well as plain toasted oat cereals sold under 38
other brand names. CDC investigators on Sunday found the bacteria in boxes
of the cereal that already had been opened, the newspaper said. And on
Monday, laboratory technicians at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
confirmed the bacteria inside boxes that had not yet been opened, it
reported. The story did not explain how unopened boxes were tested. The FDA
technicians found the bacteria in two cases, or 30 boxes, of Millville
brand toasted oat cereal picked up from a warehouse in another state.
