Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update 18 Jul 2013
-------------------------
WHO has been informed of 6 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Of these, 2 cases have been reported from Saudi Arabia and 4 from the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Both the cases in Saudi Arabia have mild symptoms and are not hospitalized. They are from Asir region. The 1st case is a 26-year-old man who is a close contact with a previously laboratory-confirmed case, and the 2nd case is a 42-year-old woman who is a health care worker.

In the UAE, the 4 cases are health care workers from 2 hospitals in Abu Dhabi who took care of an earlier laboratory-confirmed patient. Of these, 2 cases, a 28-year-old man and 30-year-old woman, did not develop symptoms of illness. The other 2 cases, both women of 30 and 40 years old, had mild upper respiratory symptoms and are in stable condition.

Globally, from September 2012 to date [18 Jul 2013], WHO has been informed of a total of 88 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 45 deaths.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travelers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.

Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhea, in patients who are immunocompromised.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO has convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to advise the Director-General on the status of the current situation. The Emergency Committee, which comprises international experts from all WHO Regions, unanimously advised that, with the information now available, and using a risk-assessment approach, the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not at present been met.

[According to the WHO 18 Jul 2013 update, there have now been 88 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV including 45 deaths reported globally. Of interest is that 5 out of the 6 cases involved healthcare workers; fortunately, all had either mild or asymptomatic infections. It suggests that there is a continued risk of transmission within the healthcare environment, similar to that seen with SARS, although it appears as though in the absence of underlying comorbidities, clinical expression of MERS-CoV infection seems to be mild in many cases. This moderator feels strongly that the healthcare sector's approach to severe acute respiratory illnesses [SARI] should include respiratory precautions as soon as the individual comes to the attention of the healthcare sector, thereby automatically reducing the likelihood of transmission of the MERS-CoV and any other known or presently unknown SARI-associated organisms.

These additional 4 cases of MERS-CoV infection in the UAE raise the total number of cases identified in the UAE to 5, plus an additional 2 cases with probable infection in the UAE but confirmed in hospitals outside of the UAE (see prior ProMED-mail posts: Novel coronavirus - Eastern Mediterranean (20): France ex UAE, WHO, Saudi Arabia 20130508.1700034; Novel coronavirus - Eastern Mediterranean (14): Germany ex UAE, WHO, fatal 20130326.1604564).

The 2 cases in Saudi Arabia that are mentioned in the above WHO report have been reported earlier on the Saudi MOH website, and were posted previously on ProMED-mail (MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (44): Saudi Arabia, new cases 20130717.1830125). In the following report ([2] below) there are an additional 2 new cases of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia.

Two New Cases of Novel Coronavirus Recorded in Riyadh and Al-Ahsa - 18 Jul 2013
------------------------
Within the framework of the epidemiological surveillance of the novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced that 2 confirmed cases of this virus have been recorded. The 1st case is a 41-year-old Saudi male in Riyadh. The 2nd case is a 59-year-old Saudi female in Al-Ahsa governorate. Both cases are at the ICU receiving the proper treatment.

It is worth mentioning that the MOH has tested 64 samples recently; given that, all of such samples have been proved negative except the cases that have been published.

[It is important to highlight that these 2 newly reported cases by the Saudi MOH are not the same cases as reported in the preceding WHO Global Update from 18 Jul 2013. The earlier 2 cases involved mild, self-limited infections that did not require hospitalizations and were in individuals in Asir region, one with known contact with a previously confirmed MERS-CoV case and the other in a healthcare worker. These 2 newly reported cases involve seriously ill individuals, both hospitalized in ICUs; one in Riyadh and the other in Al-Ahsa.

These new cases will raise the global total of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection to 90 including 45 deaths, with 70 cases confirmed in Saudi Arabia, including 38 deaths.
