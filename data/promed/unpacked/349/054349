In Negros Occidental, 56 cases of chikungunya fever, which is often accompanied by very debilitating joint pains, have been reported, 50 of which were in Kabankalan City and 6 in Cadiz City, the Provincial Health Office reported yesterday [19 Jul 2013].

Chikungunya fever is a viral illness transmitted through the bite of infected _Aedes_ mosquitoes, the same carrier of dengue fever, Dr. Ernell Tumimbang, Negros Occidental provincial health officer, said.

The illness resembles dengue fever as it usually co-occurs and is often misdiagnosed.

The symptoms of chikungunya fever include sudden onset of fever, severe headache, chills, nausea, vomiting, accompanied by severe and sometimes persistent joint pains, but it is generally not fatal unlike dengue, Tumimbang said.

Of the 50 cases of Chikungunya in Kabankalan City, 44 were in Barangay Magballo, 4 in Barangay Bantayan, and one each in barangays Locotan and Balicotoc.

In Cadiz City, the 6 cases reported were in Barangay Jerusalem.

Some chikungunya patients have reported incapacitating joint pains, or arthritis, that may last for weeks or months. The areas around the joints become swollen and painful to touch, a Center for Health Development - Western Visayas advisory said.

Such prolonged joint pain and fatigue associated with chikungunya fever are not typical of dengue. A rash may sometimes occur but hemorrhaging is rare, it added.

Time from the infected bite to the onset of illness can be 2 to 12 days, but usually it is 3 to 7 days, the advisory said.

If you have chikungunya fever symptoms, see a doctor, it advised.

Currently, there is no specific drug treatment against chikungunya fever but proper and early treatment with bed rest and sufficient intake of fluids is recommended, the advisory said. Aspirin and ibuprofen should be avoided as they are known to increase the risk of bleeding, while paracetamol can be given on medical advice, the advisory added.

To avoid mosquito bites, one should wear full-sleeve clothes and long dresses to cover the limbs, and use repellants, but care should be taken in using them on small children and the elderly, it added.

It also advised the use of mosquito nets to protect babies and old people, who may rest during the day.

Mosquito nets and coils will effectively prevent mosquitoes from biting sick people and help stop the spread of chikungunya fever [virus], the advisory also said.

Tumimbang reiterated the call for the public to remove possible mosquito breeding places such as containers with stagnant water to prevent the spread of dengue and Chikungunya.

The Department of Health (DOH) regional office in Bicol has warned the public against chikungunya and dengue diseases.

DOH Regional Director Gloria Balboa issued the warning after an outbreak of chikungunya occurred in Sta. Elena, Camarines Norte, with a total of 300 infected persons brought to hospitals.

"We have already deployed our surveillance team in the areas believed to be with high number of chikungunya cases to conduct an assessment and evaluation," Balboa said.

She urged the public to observe cleanliness, especially this rainy season, and remove all potential mosquito breeding sites.

The DOH official advised the public to consult doctors or bring their patients to a clinic or hospital if they observe symptoms of chikungunya. "It is a viral disease which is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes -- including _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_. Symptoms appear between 4 and 7 days after the patient has been bitten by the infected mosquito," Balboa explained.

She urged barangay and school officials to conduct a massive clean-up drive. "This is the immediate counter-measure to prevent possible chikungunya outbreak," Balboa added.

According to her, chikungunya [virus infection] symptoms are generally self-limiting and last for 2-3 days. The virus remains in the human system for 5-7 days and mosquitoes feeding on an infected person during this period can also become infected, Balboa said.

Chikungunya shares some clinical signs with dengue and can be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue is common. Dengue is also another threat to public this rainy season, Balboa said. "Both dengue and chikungunya are fatal, and we need a strong counter-measure to prevent the spread of these diseases brought by mosquitoes," she stressed. [The fatality rate from chikungunya virus infections is extremely low to nil. - Mod.TY]

Balboa said immediate family members must be aware of the symptoms of chikungunya and dengue. "Do not hesitate to consult your doctor, or respective rural health units in order to prevent human fatality," she advised.

[Chikungunya outbreaks continue to pop up around various Philippines islands this year (2013), with new ones reported above. One can expect these outbreaks to continue as long as the vector mosquito populations are abundant. Unless vector control measures are quickly implemented, these outbreaks are likely to continue. There is no commercially available vaccine to prevent chikungunya virus infections, so the only effective measure to prevent transmission of the virus is through timely control of mosquito vectors.
