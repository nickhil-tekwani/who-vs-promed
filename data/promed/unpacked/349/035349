H5N1 virus outbreak in migratory waterfowl
------------------------------------------
The highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus has become endemic in poultry in
southeast Asia since 2003 and constitutes a major pandemic threat to
humans. Here we describe cases of disease caused by H5N1 and transmission
of the virus among migratory geese populations in western China. This
outbreak may help to spread the virus over and beyond the Himalayas and has
important implications for developing control strategies.
H5N1 virus has occasionally been isolated from dead wild birds, usually
within the flight range of infected poultry farms. In the absence of
evidence that the virus is transmitted within wild bird populations or that
migratory birds can carry the virus, it was possible that these birds were
dead-end hosts of virus acquired from poultry. On 30 Apr 2005, however, an
outbreak was detected in barheaded geese (_Anser indicus_) at Qinghai Lake
in western China, which is a protected nature reserve with no poultry farms
in the vicinity.
Initially, sick bar-headed geese were recorded on a single islet that
contained about 3000 bar-headed geese as well as some brownheaded gulls
(_Larus brunnicephalus_), great black-headed gulls (_Larus ichthyaetus_)
and great cormorants (_Phalacrocorax carbo_). Clinical findings included
paralysis, unusual head tilt, staggering and neck thrill -- all known
features of H5N1 disease in waterfowl. By 4 May 2005, bird mortality was
more than 100 a day; by 20 May 2005, the outbreak had spread to other
islets, with some 1500 birds dead.
Overall, 90 percent of the dead birds were bar-headed geese, with the
remainder being brown-headed gulls and great black-headed gulls. We
isolated 28 H5N1 viruses from 92 cloacal, tracheal and faecal swabs from
all 3 species, and a further 5 viruses from tissue samples from bar-headed
geese.
Sequence comparison revealed that the H5N1 viruses were almost identical
across all gene segments. The haemagglutinin gene retains the motif of
basic amino acids (QGERRRKKR) in the connecting peptide that characterizes
highly pathogenic avian flu. All Qinghai isolates had a Lys 627 mutation in
the PB2 gene, which has been associated with increased virulence in mice.
Phylogenetic analysis of these isolates and 8 other H5N1 viruses, isolated
from poultry markets in Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan and Yunnan provinces
during 2005, indicated that the haemagglutinin, neuraminidase and
nucleoprotein genes of the Qinghai viruses were closely related to the H5N1
virus A/Chicken/Shantou/4231/2003 (genotype V).
However, the other 5 internal genes, represented by the matrix-protein
gene, were closely related to H5N1 viruses isolated from domestic poultry
in southern China during 2005, represented by the virus A/Chicken/
Shantou/810/2005 (genotype Z).
These viruses are therefore characterized as H5N1 genotype Z, but are
clearly distinguishable from those that have caused human infection in
Thailand and Vietnam. This indicates that the virus causing the outbreak at
Qinghai Lake was a single introduction, most probably from poultry in
southern China.
Qinghai Lake is an important aggregation and breeding site for bar-headed
geese that are distributed over central Asia. From September, they migrate
southwards to Myanmar and over the Himalayas to India, returning to Qinghai
around April. Our findings indicate that H5N1 viruses are now being
transmitted between migratory birds at the lake. Although the outbreak
could burn itself out, the large migratory bird population at Qinghai Lake
makes this unlikely. The viruses might also move to other migratory species
that could act as carriers, remaining highly pathogenic for domestic
chickens and possibly humans.
Like its precursor, A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96, the current H5N1 virus could
become established in bar-headed geese. There is a danger that it might be
carried along the birds' winter migration routes to densely populated areas
in the South Asian subcontinent, a region that seems free of this virus,
and spread along migratory flyways linked to Europe. This would vastly
expand the geographical distribution of H5N1. Increased surveillance of
poultry is called for, because previous experience has shown that control
measures become almost impossible once the virus is entrenched in poultry
populations.

[According to previous communications, including FAO's update (item 2 in
20050620.1735) and China's official notification to the OIE (item 3 in
20050523.1423), up to 6000 waterfowl of 5 species (the 4 mentioned in the
above paper as well as ruddy shelduck,_Tadorna ferruginea_) have died since
the beginning of May 2005 at Qinghai Lake in western China, allegedly due
to infection with H5N1 -- based upon the testing of samples of (only) 12
dead birds which were sent to the national laboratory for testing.
It was remarked that more sampling was needed, while information about the
characteristics of the isolated virus strain(s) was pending. The current
paper, from internationally reputable experts, provides a timely and
significant contribution to the said needs, based upon testing of 92
cloacal, tracheal and faecal swabs from 3 species.
There are some questions awaiting clarifications in this case, such as the
exceptionally high mortality in wild waterbirds of different species. What
was their respective susceptibility? Could other factors, additional to
H5N1, have played their role? Which other 5 viruses have been isolated?
Supplementary data can be found in the original paper on-line. - Mod.AS]
