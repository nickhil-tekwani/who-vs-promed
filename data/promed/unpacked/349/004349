At the end of a recent ProMED post on mumps in young adults in Lakewood, New Jersey [Mumps - USA (04): (NJ) young adults 20130717.1830577], moderator CP wrote: "Orthodox Jewish communities in general decline to have their children vaccinated."

I think CP's statement above may be erroneous. I can find no orthodox Jewish proscription against vaccination. Indeed, it seems Jewish law can be interpreted as being supportive of vaccination.

Does CP have any data on vaccination rates among orthodox Jewish children that would support the statement? A retraction would seem in order if data exists to the contrary.

Lastly, mumps could spread more readily among orthodox Jewish children studying in religious institutions not due to a lack of vaccination, but rather due to the nature of religious study in which groups of children are often close together, thereby fostering droplet transmission.

[I thank Dr Harrowe for providing this information, and I gladly retract my erroneous statement.

I had presumed erroneously that the mumps outbreak affecting mainly members of an orthodox Jewish community in New Jersey, and similarly the current measles outbreak in New York City affecting a different, mainly orthodox Jewish community (See ProMED-mail post: Measles update (27) 20130707.1811679), might reflect some religious restriction on vaccination. In fact, in prior investigations of mumps outbreaks in the US, orthodox Jewish communities have been found to be appropriately vaccinated. - Mod.CP
