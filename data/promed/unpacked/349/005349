Two Putnam County residents are recovering at home after contracting Powassan virus (POWV) virus infection, a tick-borne illness that is transmitted through the bite of an infected tick in as little as 15 minutes, officials say. New York State has seen 16 known cases of POW in the last 12 years. The county's department of health announced the news on Thursday [31 Oct 2013], noting that the New York State Department of Health notified Putnam last week.

POWV, like Lyme disease, is transmitted through the bite of an infected deer (black-legged) tick. POWV can be transmitted in as little as 15 minutes; in contrast, most Lyme infections require the tick be attached for at least 36 to 48 hours before the bacterium can be transmitted. Since POWV is a virus, antibiotics are not effective as they are with the bacterial Lyme disease. Signs and symptoms of POWV infection can include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, seizures, and memory loss. Long-term neurological problems may occur. People with severe POWV illness often need to be hospitalized to receive respiratory support, intravenous fluids, or medications to reduce swelling in the brain that may occur.

People most likely to be exposed to ticks are those out in wooded and tall, grassy areas -- campers, gardeners, hikers, hunters and outdoor workers -- the Putnam department of health said. Deer ticks do no fly or jump. They rest on low-lying vegetation and attach to animals and people who are passing by. "The risk is greatest along trails in the woods and on the edges of properties with tall vegetation, where the higher humidity levels are ideal for tick survival," experts said. "However, ticks are also carried into lawns and gardens by pets, mice and other small animals."

Here are some tips on avoiding ticks, as provided in the press release: Tuck pants into socks and shirts into pants when in wooded and grassy areas. Wear light-colored clothing to spot ticks more easily. Check for ticks on clothing or skin frequently. Brush them off before they can attach to your skin. Do a thorough "tick check" of your entire body daily. Pay particular attention to the back of the knees, behind the ears, the scalp, the armpits and your back. Repellents containing DEET have been effective in preventing tick bites. If you decide to use a tick repellent, apply carefully and follow all label directions. Bathe or shower and change clothes when you go back inside. Do not apply repellents directly to children. Apply to your hands and then transfer it to the child. Never apply repellents to children's hands or face. No one should apply repellents near eyes, nose or mouth.

If you find an attached tick, it needs to be removed immediately, officials say. The Health Department suggests using a fine-tipped tweezers to "carefully grasp the mouth-parts-not the body-of the tick," close to the skin and pull the tick out, "gently and steadily," without twisting or squeezing. The bite area should then be thoroughly washed, and antiseptic should be applied.

Of the 16 known cases in New York since 2001, 5 were in Putnam. The virus is "significantly less common" than the Lyme disease bacterium, according to officials. A recent study of ticks across the Hudson Valley showed that Putnam had the highest rate of POWV infection across 7 counties, according to a press release. It was found in 3.84 percent of ticks.

[According to the ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses), Powassan virus (POWV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_. Specifically, it belongs to the mammalian group of tick-borne flaviviruses and is closely related to Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus. Human cases of POWV infections have been recognized in the United States, Canada and Russia. In the United States, cases of POWV disease have been reported primarily from northeastern states and the Great Lakes region.

Between 2001 and 2012, POWV neuroinvasive disease cases have been reported in Maine (2), Michigan (1), Minnesota (19), New York (13), Pennsylvania (1), Virginia (1), and Wisconsin (10). These cases occur primarily in the late spring, early summer, and mid-fall when ticks are most active. Signs and symptoms of infection can include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, seizures, and memory loss. Long-term neurological problems may occur. There is no specific treatment, but people with severe POWV illnesses often need hospitalisation to receive respiratory support, intravenous fluids, or medications to reduce swelling in the brain.

POWV is maintained in a cycle between ticks and small-to-medium-sized rodents. In North America, 3 main enzootic cycles occur: _Ixodes cookei_ and woodchucks, _Ixodes marxi_ and squirrels, and _Ixodes scapularis_ and white-footed mice. _Ixodes cookei_ and _Ixodes marxi_ rarely bite humans. _Ixodes scapularis_ often bites humans and is the primary vector of Lyme disease.

There are 2 types of POWV in the United States. The 1st type, often called lineage 1 POWV , appears to be associated with _Ixodes cookei_ or _Ixodes marxiticks_. The other type, lineage 2 POWV is sometimes called Deer tick virus, and is associated with _Ixodes scapularis_ ticks. Both lineages have been linked to human disease. Humans become infected with POWV from the bite of an infected tick. Humans do not develop high enough concentrations of POWV in their bloodstreams to infect feeding ticks. Humans are, therefore, considered to be "dead-end" hosts of the virus. For further information see: http://www.cdc.gov/powassan/.

All residents of and visitors to areas where POWV activity has been identified are at risk of infection. People who engage in outdoor work and recreational activities in endemic areas are at increased risk of infection. Reduce the risk of being infected with POW virus by using tick repellents, wearing long sleeves and pants, avoiding bushy and wooded areas, and doing thorough tick checks after spending time outdoors. - Mod.CP
