"The international laboratory based surveillance network for salmonella
infections - Salm-Net (now superseded by the Enter-net network) comprises
the following countries; Austria, Belgium, Denmark, England & Wales,
Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway,
Portugal, Scotland, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland (participants in
Greece and Luxembourg have also been identified and await confirmation).
The aim of Enter-/Salm-Net is to improve the surveillance of cases of human
salmonellosis and VTEC O157 on an international basis; thus providing the
opportunity to detect international clusters that indicate an outbreak from
a common source at an early stage. In addition the network provides the
ability to evaluate the effectiveness of prevention measures and monitor
the trends in disease.
One part of the project has been the creation of a database of all
salmonellae isolated within these countries which includes retrospective
and prospective data, while this database is not open to access by external
users it is available to all participants. An examination of this database
has revealed that there is a low incidence of _Salmonella meleagridis_
within Europe. There have been a total of 19 isolates (to 30 September)
identified in 1997, 18 in 1996 and 83 in 1995."

Review of data in England and Wales shows that the following numbers of
cases were identified.

1992 - 3 Cases
1993 - 3 Cases
1994 - 1 Case
1995 - 5 Cases
1996 - 1 Case
So far this year two cases have been identified. In week 20 a one year old
child, in week 28 a 24 year old male with a history of travel in Mexico.
It is possible that both cases may have been infected abroad. Exposure in
the UK is obviously minimal and shows no recent change.
[It is interesting to see the variation and stability in the reported
occurrence of this disease agent for parts of Europe and North America.
The value of monitoring data like this is increased by the application of Q
charts or other statistical process control type analysis. Such monitoring
tools are relatively simple to implement but help gain insight into changes
in reported occurrence over time and how likely such things are to be the
result of natural variation and how likely they might be due to systematic
factors. BTW, sorry for not catching the mispelling of _Salmonella
meleagridis_ in the original posting in this series. - Mod. pc

I would expect a slow but steady exchange of serotypes of all commensal
bacteria and probably (mildly) pathogenic ones over a period of years, or
even decades. Ok, I have no evidence for this but I wonder if we soon will
have. Certainly among pathogens (eg influenza virus) a cyclic set of
infection waves as populations become susceptible and then resistant and
then susceptible again is usual. In the far more complex environment of
the gut, where the natural flora presumably also cycles as new
bacterial strains attempt to elbow their way in, as well as the effect of
the host immune response I would have expected a similar pattern.

The result of this is that PROMED will have a very long and active life
reporting regular increases in new strains for decades to come. The
downside may be that trying to prevent what may be a natural progression of
mildly pathogenic serotypes because they are 'possibly dangerous' be
ineffective and ultimately pointless.
