Measles in West Africa ­ background
-----------------------------------
A recent outbreak in Cameroon reminds us that measles rates in West Africa
have changed little during the past 2 decades. Regional trends are depicted
in the following graph: <http://exhibit.gideononline.com/measles-wafr.jpg>.

An additional graph illustrates the fact that vaccine use has clearly been
associated with declining morbidity; however, vaccination rates remain
below 75 per cent: <http://exhibit.gideononline.com/measles-cameroon.JPG>.

[Measles is endemic wherever the vaccination coverage is low. The figures
shown by Gideon are probably reported cases through official channels, and
it is expected that cases are not reported. The province borders Nigeria
and Chad and reemergence through cases imported from either of these
countries is a possibility. ­ Mod.EP
