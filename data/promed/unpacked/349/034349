Four people have now died, and 24 others are said to be in critical condition following an outbreak of [Legionnaire's disease] in Portugal. The majority of cases so far have emerged from the central Portuguese region of Vila Franca de Xira and are being treated in hospitals in the Greater Lisbon area.

In a press conference yesterday [8 Nov 2014] afternoon, the head of Portugal's health board, Francisco George, recommended people take baths instead of showers and avoid Jacuzzis and hydro-massage tubs until the source of the outbreak is known.

In 24 hours, the number of people in this country believed to be infected with Legionnaires disease, caught by inhaling water particles, has soared to close to 120.

One of the victims, who died from the infection, a 59-year-old man, reportedly had other pre-existing lung and breathing conditions which lent added complications. Portuguese specialists have said the outbreak is unexpected and very unusual.

Four people are reported dead, and over 100 others have been infected with Legionnaires' disease in Portugal.

Victims in the Lisbon area include a 66-year-old man and an 81-year-old woman, both of whom were already seriously ill.

Caused by the _Legionella_ bacteria, the lung infection cannot be spread directly from person to person but is caught by breathing in small droplets of contaminated water via, for example, air conditioning systems.

The origin of this outbreak is unknown.

An outbreak of the _Legionella_ bacteria, which causes a type of pneumonia known as Legionnaire's disease, has hospitalized 90 people in the greater Lisbon area in Portugal and killed one man since cases began to be reported on Friday [7 Nov 2014], according to local news reports.

The Portuguese authorities are seeking out the source of the outbreak, which is focused on an area on the outskirts of the Portuguese capital, near the neighboring city of Vila Franca.

Of the 90 people hospitalized, one, a man aged 59 with a history of lung problems has died, and another 16 are in critical condition.

Portugal's National Health Directorate has taken samples from the area's drinking water supply and ordered disinfection of water tanks. The Secretary of State for Health has warned the population to avoid taking showers or using Jacuzzis or hot-tubs until the source of the infection has been identified.

_Legionella_ is a waterborne bacterium that infects its human host when water droplets are inhaled into the lungs. Most often, the source of infection are cooling towers, air conditioning systems, or similar systems in public spaces or buildings such as shopping centers.

Despite warnings that drinking infected water would not lead to infection, the Vila Franca population has rushed to buy bottled water for household consumption, with supermarkets and other retailers completely selling out.

Local epidemiologists have said that, as the _Legionella_ bacterium has an incubation period of around 2 weeks, it is likely more people will show symptoms and end up in hospital even once the source of the infection has been found.

[For a discussion of legionnaires' disease, see moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - Spain: (CT) 20130901.1916014.

The 3rd news report above says drinking _Legionella_-contaminated tap water would not lead to infection. However, aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated tap water may be the source for _Legionella_ pneumonia in people prone to aspirate (http://legionella.org/media/14950/cab.pdf) and in neonates born in _Legionella_-contaminated birthing pools (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/alert-after-legionnaires-disease-case-in-baby). Particularly at risk for severe disease are people with weakened immune systems, the elderly, and smokers.

Vila Franca de Xira, with a population of 136 886 in 2011, is a municipality in the Lisbon District, 32 km northeast of the Portuguese capital Lisbon (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vila_Franca_de_Xira). - Mod.ML
