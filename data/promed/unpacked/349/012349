Abstract
The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has reached nearly every country in the world with extraordinary person-to-person transmission. The most likely original source of the virus was spillover from an animal reservoir and subsequent adaptation to humans sometime during the winter of 2019 in Wuhan Province, China. Because of its genetic similarity to SARS-CoV-1, it is likely that this novel virus has a similar host range and receptor specificity. Due to concern for human-pet transmission, we investigated the susceptibility of domestic cats and dogs to infection and potential for infected cats to transmit to na√Øve cats. We report that cats are highly susceptible to subclinical infection, with a prolonged period of oral and nasal viral shedding that is not accompanied by clinical signs and are capable of direct contact transmission to other cats.

These studies confirm that cats are susceptible to productive SARS-CoV-2 infection but are unlikely to develop clinical disease. Further, we document that cats develop a robust neutralizing antibody response that prevented re-infection to a second viral challenge. Conversely, we found that dogs do not shed virus following infection but do mount an anti-viral neutralizing antibody response.

There is currently no evidence that cats or dogs play a significant role in human exposure; however, reverse zoonosis is possible if infected owners expose their domestic pets during acute infection. Resistance to re-exposure holds promise that a vaccine strategy may protect cats, and by extension humans, to disease susceptibility.

[The described experiments, which involved 7 adult cats and 3 adult dogs, expand upon existing work by providing shedding kinetics in cats over time. Virus neutralization, seroconversion, and exploring transmission are assessed; furthermore, the results are indicative of established protective immunity against SAR-CoV-2 following repeated exposure.

The authors conclude that cats may "serve as a suitable animal model for studying SARS-2 infection, furthering the development of vaccines and therapeutics for use in both animals and humans." They also confirm an earlier report that dogs do not replicate virus locally.

The role of cats in zoonotic transmission remains an open question, but relatively short duration of shedding and resistance to re-exposure "suggests risk of this is very low, particularly when cats are kept indoors."

In a recent interview, the director of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Gao Fu, told reporters that he went "in early January 2020" to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, at that time suspected to be the source of the epidemic, "to collect samples for COVID-19 researchers, but no viruses were detected in the animal samples. Viruses were only found in environmental samples, including sewage;" (https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1189506.shtml).

China's initial information on the event indicated that the Huanan market was closed on Wed 1 Jan 2020. Since no information became available on the composition of the animal population kept on the market or their test results, ProMED-mail published an RFI on 10 Feb 2010, which included the following questions, still pending (20200210.6972104):

1. Which (domestic/wildlife) animal species are known to have been present in the market on 31 Dec 2019 and/or 1 Jan 2020?
2. What was the fate of the animals above? In case killed, details on the mode of disposal and quantitative data are requested.
3. Was sampling of (any of) the market's animals, in vivo/in vitro, performed?
4. In case sampled, which lab tests have been applied? If affirmed, results, per species, negative included, are requested.
5. Were the (state/local) Veterinary Services involved throughout the procedures above?

Most likely, the Huanan seafood market included a considerable (stray) cat population. Their test results are becoming of particular interest. - Mod.AS]
