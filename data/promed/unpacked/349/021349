Swine fever hits 3 500 pigs
----------------------------
Farmers are mourning another blow to the swine industry after the discovery
of swine fever at a farm in Suffolk. About 3 500 pigs infected by the first
outbreak of classical swine fever (CSF) in Britain for 14 years are to be
slaughtered and destroyed. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foods
(MAFF) said the infected animals were supplied by a breeding unit in
Norfolk which has also sent pigs to an Essex farm.
There were fears that the disease could spread rapidly throughout the
country. The MAFF, which refused to name the farm or give its precise
location, said it was establishing a large designated infected area in
Suffolk from which farmers would not be allowed to move pigs without a licence.
A spokesman said: "We want to establish if the disease originated on the
farm or was imported from elsewhere."

Sources: multiple, MAFF, and media

An outbreak of classical swine fever (CSF) has been confirmed on a Suffolk
pig finishing farm - the first outbreak in Britain since 1986. All 3 500
pigs have been destroyed. A 3km protection zone has been set up around the
infected premises. In this area movement of any pigs is banned. The source
of the outbreak is unknown as yet, but Ministry of Agriculture (MAFF)
officials are investigating other farms in Norfolk and Essex which are
linked to the infected farm. News updates and background information on CSF

[Classical swine fever (CSF) is also known as hog cholera. It is a
contagious febrile disease of pigs. CSF is caused by infection with a
virus, which is a member of the Pestivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family
of RNA viruses. This was previously classified in the Togaviridae along
with flaviviruses.
Clinical signs usually appear 5 to 10 days after infection. An individual
pig may show 1 of 4 types of clinical effect:
Peracute is the sudden death and usually is at the beginning of an
outbreak. Young pigs may be found dead without any other sign of illness.
Acute CSF, which is the most common form usually has fever (40.5-41.5
degrees C, 105-107 degrees F) as its first sign, then depression, weakness,
anorexia, conjunctivitis. Constipation is followed by diarrhea or vomiting.
There may be purple discoloration of abdominal skin, or necrosis of the
tips of extremities (ears, tail, vulva). Neurological signs may occur and
include incoordination, tremors, convulsions, and circling. The high
mortality (nearly 100 percent) of acutely affected pigs, occurs usually
within a week of initial signs. Other infections may occur concomitantly
with CSF. The most frequent is _Salmonella choleraesuis_.
Chronic CSF is the form of disease occurring with some low virulence
strains of virus or when CSF occurs in vaccinated herds. Clinical signs
include weight loss, hair loss, dermatitis, discoloration of the abdomen or
ears. The affected pigs may recover or may relapse.
Subclinical CSF occurs in pigs infected prior to birth, or in pigs which
have been vaccinated. No signs are seen, but they may be infectious to
other pigs.
Other clinical signs may include abortions, stillbirths, mummification and
possibly congenital tremor in the piglets. Swine are the only species
clinically affected. The virus can replicate transiently in sheep and
cattle while wild boars can be a reservoir of the virus.
Pigs can become infected by ingestion, inhalation, genital (semen)
infection or by wound contamination. CSF is most easily spread by contact
with infected pigs or feeding of inadequately cooked garbage (swill).
Spread the virus by fomites (e.g., clothing or needles) or by biting
insects is possible.
Diagnosis is made in herds with suspicious clinical signs and confirmed by:
serology (blood antibody tests), ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay),
serum neutralization test (SNT), fluorescent antibody test on cryostat
sections of necropsied tissues from pigs with clinical symptoms of CSF and
by virus isolation from affected pigs. The tissues of choice for virus
detection are the tonsils, or lymph nodes. - Mod.TG
