["Newcastle disease (ND) is a disease of major importance for poultry and other birds. It is caused by specified viruses of the avian paramyxovirus type (APMV-I) of the family _Paramyxoviridae_. The disease is characterised by respiratory and/or nervous signs, partial or complete cessation of egg production or misshapen eggs, greenish watery diarrhoea and oedema of the tissues around the eyes and the neck.

The infection is spread via direct contact with secretions, especially faeces, from infected birds or indirect contact through contaminated feed, water, equipment, vehicles, humans, fomites etc.

The use of prophylactic and emergency vaccination is permitted. Prophylactic vaccination is applied on a large scale in the EU and elsewhere in the world. All Member States except Sweden, Finland, and Estonia apply a prophylactic vaccination policy. So far emergency vaccination was used only once in Italy during an outbreak in 2001." (http://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/animal-diseases/control-measures/newcastle-disease_en)
