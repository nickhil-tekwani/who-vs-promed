INFECTION CONTROL - FLORIDA, USA & REQUEST FOR INFO
===================================================
Date: Sun, 2 Jun 1996 17:46:17 -0700
From: bucks1@ix.netcom.com (C.K. Scarborough)

In Jacksonville, Florida, there is a monthly meeting of infection
control professionals; The northeast Florida Practioners of
Infection Control and guests meet to share info on community and
facilities infections, epidemiology studies and updates on
issues such as isolation procedures, decontamination/sterilization
procedures/equipment, lab and pharmacy update relating to inf. control
and education of patient/staff/communities. Plans are made during the
business portion of the meeting, for future city infection control
conferences.
Members include local health dept section leaders
(HIV/AIDS section, statistics for reportable diseases, and outbreak
prevention/identification and control etc. sections), hospital
and nursing home inf. control coordinators (usually RN's), police
and fire dept reps (notably EMT's and paramedics included), military
inf. control hospital and clinic (land health facility for in port
ships and ship support, and flight groups as well as some reservists,
and marines...), pharmacy/ medical supply company reps (they are not
only committee members, but also provide inservice on new equipment
and drugs, and antimicrobial disinfectants/sterilants), and others.
This is a fantastic way to share verbal and written info, on an
ongoing basis.
One example -- a pertussis alert was recently issued. I did not attend the
meeting as I am in the process of relocating from a large Jacksonville
clinic to a hospital in Dallas. But the Jacksonville parent hospital
infection control nurse gave me a copy of the alert; I copied it and gave
each of about 23 Medical Providers at the clinic a copy (including
lab/pharmacy/pediatrics/OB-GYN, Emergency Room...Family Planning) a copy.
Then I placed a summary of the article to all the clinic staff in the e-mail
system.
*************REQUEST
Do other cities have such a committee and publish statistics within these
that include summaries of reportable diseases, resistance and
suceptibilities, outbreaks etc.?
