Human dirofilariasis diagnosed in Orenburg province
-------------------------------------------
The 1st human case of dirofilariasis was registered in Orenburg [bordering
Northern Kazakhstan], according to the OrinNews newspaper. The dog is the
main host of _Dirofilaria immitis_, and the infection can be transmitted to
humans through mosquito bites. Mosquitoes pierce the skin, and larvae of
the parasite, after insertion, grow into worms about as thick as a thread,
up to several centimeters in length. A furuncle (purulent inflammation of a
hair follicle in the skin) develops and needs to be removed surgically.

[Human infection with _Dirofilaria_ spp. is rare but has been reported in the
literature. Mosquitoes transmit _Dirofilaria_. _D. immitis_ inhabits blood
vessels in both man and its usual hosts, cats and dogs (dog lung worm), but
does not produce cutaneous nodules; whereas the less prevalent species _D.
tenuis_ in raccoons in the USA, _D. repens_ in dogs & cats in Africa, Asia &
Europe, & _D. ursi_ in bears in Canada, may produce subcutaneous nodules in
man.
This case of a subcutaneous parasite therefore cannot be _D. immitis_ and
must be another species, perhaps _D. repens_. Given the rarity of
_Dirofilaria_ infections in humans, differential diagnoses must be
considered, including cysticercosis caused by _Taenia solium_. Cysticercosis
causes similar subcutaneous nodules containing larval material, and humans
are infected from fecal material containing _T. solium_ eggs. It is likely
that cysticercosis and intestinal _T. solium_ are present in this geographic
region. - Mod.EP/JW]
