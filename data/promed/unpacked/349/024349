[in Portuguese, summarized by Mod.JW; edited]

The frontier between Brazil and Paraguay has been closed since 23 Sep 2002
because of suspected FMD in Paraguay. No live animals susceptible to FMD,
animal products, or subproducts are allowed to pass.
The suspect area is in the province of Canindeyu, township of Corpus
Christi. Brazil alleges that for 18 months Paraguay has been denying the
presence of FMD, a denial which has caused enormous damage to the Brazilian
cattle-rearing state of Mato Grosso do Sul [presumably because exports have
been affected. - Mod.JW]. The National Service for Animal Control & Health
of Paraguay (Senacsa) has said that the outbreak is due to IBR (infectious
bovine rhinotracheitis).
On 2 Oct 2002 Paraguay refused to admit veterinarians from the Pan-American
Foot & Mouth Disease Center (Panaftosa) along with those from the
Agriculture Ministry of Brazil to obtain diagnostic specimens. [Vesicular
diseases of cattle are almost impossible to distinguish clinically, hence
the need for a lab diagnosis. - Mod.JW]
Brazil brought forward the annual November FMD vaccination of livestock in
the frontier area to 26 Sep - 21 Oct 2002.
Argentina has now closed its border with Paraguay to livestock traffic.
