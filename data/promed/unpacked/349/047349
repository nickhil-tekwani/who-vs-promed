[2] WHO: cases rose 20% in past week
Date: Wed 17 Aug 2022

For the 2nd week in row, monkeypox [MPX] cases increased by about 20%, with most case increases seen in Europe and North America, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

According to the WHO, more than 35 000 cases of monkeypox have now been reported from 92 countries and territories, with 12 deaths.

"Almost all cases continue to be reported among men who have sex with men, underscoring the importance for all countries to design and deliver services and information tailored to these communities that protect health, human rights, and dignity," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, in remarks today [17 Aug 2022].

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 799 more cases, raising the nation's total to 12 689 [now 13 517]. New York has the most cases, with 2620 [now 2675], followed by California with 1945 [now 2356].

In Texas, Harris County has reported a pediatric monkeypox case, the nation's 8th pediatric case. Officials said the child does not attend daycare or school, and has no immediate family members infected.

Lack of optimal guidance spotlighted
------------------------------------
Yesterday [16 Aug 2022] in BMJ Global Health, experts who searched 6 major databases for clinical guidelines on monkeypox found a dearth of information and suggest that the absence of clear clinical guidance is hindering the outbreak response.

The 14 clinical guidelines that do exist are limited in scope, with only 5 guidelines (36%) providing any advice for children, and only 3 (21%) providing advice for pregnant women or for people living with HIV.

Several epidemiologic studies of the current outbreak have shown that a high proportion of monkeypox cases are also HIV positive. And treatment guidelines were also out of date, with 7 suggesting the use of cidofovir, instead of tecovirimat (Tpoxx), which the WHO currently recommends.

"The data shows an urgent need to develop evidence-based clinical management guidelines that could be used in all settings globally," the authors write. "Considering most cases of MPX are mild, and the risk of severe side effects from some of the treatments, there is a need for more detailed indications and understanding of safety profiles to guide treatment decisions, to benefit patient care."

Trouble meeting vaccine demand
------------------------------
Bavarian Nordic, the maker of Jynneos (Imvanex in Europe and Imvamune in Canada), told Bloomberg News it no longer may be able to meet the demand for monkeypox vaccines.

"Demand keeps rising, and it's no longer certain that we can continue to meet the demand we're facing even with the upgrade of our existing manufacturing site in Denmark," Rolf Sass Sorensen, a vice president at Bavarian Nordic, said. The company said it may outsource some manufacturing to the United States.

In other vaccine news, Blue Water Vaccines Inc (BWV), said it is in the beginning stages of developing a monkeypox vaccine that uses a virus-like particle (VLP) platform.

"As monkeypox cases rise around the globe, BWV is committed to exploring the potential of our platform to create a novel monkeypox vaccine candidate," said Joseph Hernandez, BWV chairman and CEO, in a press release. "Our VLP platform has previously demonstrated versatility across multiple infectious diseases, and we are excited to initiate this research to understand the potential to create another vaccine to fight this outbreak."

[A ProMED reader, Allen Lenoir <alenoir165@aol.com>, asks,
One also wonders if the sharing of an E-cigarette may have been the source of the infection.

Interestingly, there have been no suggestions in the reports coming to ProMED of e-cigarettes as a monkeypox virus transmission vehicle. - Mod.TY]

[4] Iran: 1st case

https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/34-year-old-woman-is-Iran-s-first-monkeypox-case-17377151.php


Iranian authorities announced Tuesday [16 Aug 2022] the 1st case of monkeypox in the country, the official IRNA news agency reported.

The report said health authorities quarantined a 34-year-old woman living in the southwestern city of Ahvaz.

Pedram Pakaeen, health ministry spokesperson, said the patient and her family members informed doctors after she developed symptoms on the skin of her hands.

Monkeypox spreads when people have close, physical contact with an infected person's lesions, their clothing or bedsheets. Sexual contact may amplify transmission.

Most people recover from monkeypox without needing treatment, but the lesions can be extremely painful. More severe cases can result in complications including brain inflammation and death.

With only a limited global supply of vaccines, authorities are racing to stop the spread of the disease.

[5] Severe monkeypox with HIV infection: case report

https://doi.org/10.1007/s15010-022-01901-z


ref: Boesecke C, Monin MB, van Bremen K, et al. Severe monkeypox-virus infection in undiagnosed advanced HIV infection. Infection. 2022
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A 40-year old male presented to his GP [general practitioner physician] with a red spot on the tip of his nose which was initially classified as a sunburn. Within 3 days, the nasal area progressed to necrosis (Fig. 1). In parallel, typical MPXV lesions (confirmed by PCR) appeared on the whole body with serious infection of the penis and oral mucosa. The patient was transferred to a tertiary care hospital for tecovirimat treatment. Diagnostic work-up revealed a concomitant syphilis of longer duration (TPPA 1:2560, VDRL 1:8) and an advanced HIV infection with a CD4 T cell count of 127/uL. The patient had never been tested for sexually transmitted diseases (STD) before. The patient was treated with oral tecovirimat 600 mg bid for 7 days in addition to antiretroviral therapy (bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofoviralafenamide single tablet p.o. qd) for the HIV infection and ceftriaxone 2 g i.v. for 10 days for the syphilis. The monkeypox lesions on the skin dried out and the nose partially improved with less swelling. Most cases of MPXV infection so far have been reported as mild and controlled HIV infection does not appear to be a risk factor for severe courses. However, this case illustrates the potential severity of MPXV infection in the setting of severe immunosuppression and untreated HIV infection.
