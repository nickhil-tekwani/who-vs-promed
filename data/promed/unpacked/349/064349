The avian influenza [AI] virus H5N1 could become entrenched in
chickens and domestic ducks and geese in parts of Europe, FAO warned
today [25 Oct 2007].

The agency stressed that healthy domestic ducks and geese may
transmit the virus to chickens and play a more important role in the
persistence of the virus in the region than previously thought. H5N1
surveillance in countries with significant domestic duck and geese
populations should be urgently increased.

FAO's warning followed the detection of H5N1 in diseased young
domestic ducks by German scientists.

"It seems that a new chapter in the evolution of avian influenza may
be unfolding silently in the heart of Europe," said FAO's Chief
Veterinary Officer, Joseph Domenech. "If it turns out to be true that
the H5N1 virus can persist in apparently healthy domestic duck and
geese populations, then countries need to urgently reinforce their
monitoring and surveillance schemes in all regions with significant
duck and geese production for the presence of H5N1."

"Europe should prepare for further waves of avian influenza
outbreaks, most probably in an east-west direction, if the virus
succeeds in persisting throughout the year in domestic waterfowl.
This heightens the need for increased surveillance and monitoring of
possible virus circulation in domestic ducks and geese," Domenech said.

The link between domestic ducks and geese and chickens is seen by
many experts as one of the major underlying factors in outbreaks of
HPAI in disease-entrenched countries.

"We are particularly concerned about the Black Sea area which has a
high concentration of chickens, ducks, and geese," said FAO senior
animal health officer Jan Slingenbergh.

"In the Ukraine alone, the number of domestic ducks is estimated at
around 20 million birds. In Romania, 4 million domestic ducks and 4
million domestic geese are found in the Danube delta. These figures
compare easily with chicken and waterfowl densities in Asia, where
the virus continues to circulate among chickens and has found a niche
in countries with tens of millions of domestic ducks and geese,"
Slingenbergh said.

Importantly, the Black Sea area serves as a main wintering area for
migratory birds coming from Siberia and moving also to the
Mediterranean and other regions. All countries bordering the Black
Sea have experienced outbreaks of avian influenza in the past,
favoured by traditional open poultry systems with poor separation
between wild and domestic birds.

The link between the H5N1 virus and domestic ducks and geese has
recently been confirmed in Germany.

Scientists of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut in Riems have detected
the H5N1 virus in diseased young ducks on a farm at the end of August
[2007]. Further scrutiny at 2 other farms revealed that, despite the
absence of clinical signs and mortality in these ducks, the animals
had been in contact with the H5N1 virus, because their immune defense
system showed antibodies, developed in response to the virus.
Intensified monitoring finally confirmed pockets of H5N1 on one of the farms.

Based on its experience in fighting avian influenza around the world
over the past 3 years, FAO considers that risk assessment,
surveillance, and virus search strategies should be reviewed, Domenech said.

Countries with significant domestic duck and geese populations in
Western and Central Europe as well as the Black Sea region should
consider the incidence in Germany as a wake-up call and should not
limit the virus search to chickens. Good surveillance is already in
place in many European countries and the European Commission has
issued in 2007 very comprehensive guidelines.

But there are countries where more monitoring is urgently needed
including more focus on ducks and geese, which should be considered
as particularly risky populations.

"It could well be that there is more virus circulation in Europe than
currently assumed," Slingenbergh said. "We are not saying that the
virus is widely spread in European countries, in fact most of the
countries are currently virus-free. But undetected localized virus
spots in countries with significant waterfowl may pose a continuous risk."

After Asia and Africa, Europe could become the 3rd continent where
the H5N1 could become endemic in some areas, FAO said.

[According to EU data, as of 24 Oct 2007, 306 HPAI cases in wild
birds have been notified by Member States (MS) to ADNS (Animal
Disease Notification system) since Jan 2007. The reports came from 3
countries: Germany (298), France (7), and the Czech republic (1). No
information on the investigations, carried out in the other MS, is
included. See

Bird flu outbreaks have occurred in Viet Nam's northern Cao Bang
Province since 10 Oct 2007, raising the total number of localities
currently affected by the disease to 3.

The disease has killed or infected 480 ducks and 80 chickens raised
by 13 households in Trung Khanh district, the Department of Animal
Health under the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development said Friday [26 Oct 2007], noting that samples from the
fowls have been tested positive to bird flu virus strain H5N1.

To prevent bird flu spread, local veterinary agencies have culled all
ill poultry and isolated the affected areas.

Now, bird flu is hitting Cao Bang, central Quang Tri Province, and
southern Tra Vinh Province.

Bird flu outbreaks in Viet Nam, starting in December 2003, have
killed and led to the forced culling of dozens of millions of fowls
in the country, according to the department.

[Since the start of the renewed epizootic, in December 2006, 97
outbreaks of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) H5N1 have been
reported to the OIE (Office International des Epizooties; World
Organisation for Animal Health). They are covered in 11 follow-up
reports, the last one submitted on 11 Oct 2007 (see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6332>).


An excellent complementary source of information can be found in the
website of FAO's Representation in Hanoi, Viet Nam, which includes a
situation Update, based upon the data provided by Viet Nam's
Department of Animal Health (DAH), Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development (MARD). The update of 26 Oct 2007 is available at
<http://www.fao.org.vn/new1.pdf>.

According to said page, 32 provinces (out of a total of 64) in Viet
Nam have been affected by avian influenza since December 2006. The
provinces are: Bac Giang, Bac Lieu, Bac Ninh, Ca Mau, Can Tho, Cao
Bang, Dien Bien, Dong Thap, Ha Nam, Hai Duong, Hai Phong, Hanoi, Ha
Tay, Ha Tinh, Hau Giang, Hung Yen, Kien Giang, Nam Dinh, Nghe An,
Ninh Binh, Phu Tho, Quang Binh, Quang Nam, Quang Ninh, Quang Tri,
Vinh Long, Vinh Phuc, Son La, Soc Trang, Tra Vinh, Thai Binh, and Thai Nguyen.

The website includes the following additional information:

- The 5th wave of avian influenza was reported in the country from 6
May 2007, with the 1st occurrence on 1 May 2007. Since May [2007], AI
has been reported in poultry in 22 provinces.
- 7 human cases have been reported, of which 4 were fatal and 3 have recovered.
- The 2nd AI vaccination campaign for 2007 (October) is underway in
40 provinces, where 62.65 million poultry have been vaccinated. These
include 39.44 million chickens, and 23.20 million ducks.
- The 1st AI vaccination campaign for 2007 was completed in September
for 63 provinces, where a total of 164.47 million poultry have been
vaccinated (87.42 million chickens, 73.15 million ducks, and 3.90
million muscovy ducks). In addition, almost 42.23 million doses of
vaccine have been administered by private livestock firms.

Page 9 of the PDF document above includes a map showing the outbreaks
during 2006/2007, and an epidemiological curve on the 294 outbreaks
recorded between December 2006 and 26 Oct 2007 (weekly figures and
geographic distribution). - Mods.AS/MPP]
