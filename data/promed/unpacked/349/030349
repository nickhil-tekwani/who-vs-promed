Spoiled or possibly sabotaged measles vaccine has killed as many as 50 children in insurgent-held areas of northwestern Syria, forcing a suspension of a large-scale vaccination campaign intended to stop the spread of measles, mumps, rubella and polio, volunteer medical organizations reported Wednesday [17 Sep 2014].

The victims, some of them infants, apparently all died on Tuesday [16 Sep 2014], mostly concentrated in the cities of Jarjanaz and Sinjar in Idlib province, an area controlled by forces opposed to President Bashar Assad. These opposition forces have sought to function as an interim government and provide basic health care services, including inoculations and vaccinations to children, given the collapse of Syria's public health care system since the civil war began more than 3 years ago.

Dozens of other children in Idlib were reported to have been sickened by the vaccine. Dr. Abdulla Ajaj, a physician who helped administer the vaccine, said the suspect batch of doses had been received 3 days before they were used. "This is the 1st time we have had such a problem," he said in a Skype interview.

The provenance of the vaccine was not immediately clear, but Ajaj speculated that the doses may have been stored at improperly high temperatures. "Most probably they were badly kept inside the fridges," he said.

The Syrian American Medical Society, which organizes medical missions to Syria and runs a hospital in Idlib, said recipients of the bad vaccine began displaying symptoms within minutes, including shortness of breath, slowed heart rate, wheezing and inflammation of the larynx. The group's own facility saw at least 65 patients, it said in a statement, and 15 were dead on arrival, all under the age of 1.

The statement said the reason the medicines turned deadly were unclear, "though local staff speculate that the vaccinations may have been compromised by the storage location in Jarjanaz or potential tampering with the vaccinations."

Physicians for Human Rights, a New York-based organization that has liaisons in opposition-controlled areas of northwest Syria, distributed an internal email saying that as many as 50 children may have died from the vaccine, which appeared to have been either spoiled or outdated, and that samples had been sent to Turkey for analysis.

The interim government posted a statement on its website that it had suspended the vaccination campaign and was investigating "in order to learn the truth behind this humanitarian disaster."

Medics carrying out a vaccination programme in rebel-held northern Syria accidentally administered a muscle relaxant to up to 75 children, killing 15 of them, the opposition says.

A preliminary investigation by the National Coalition found atracurium was given to the children instead of a solution used to mix measles vaccines.

The packaging for the drug is said to be similar to that of the solution.

All of the children who died on Tuesday [16 Sep 2014] were between 6 and 18 months old.

Their parents initially accused the opposition health authorities of not storing the vaccines properly or using out-of-date medication.

The National Coalition meanwhile said it suspected a "security breach by vandals" linked to the government of President Bashar al-Assad.

Immunisation drive
------------------
The 3-year-old conflict in Syria and the resultant breakdown in state institutions have meant that diseases such as measles and polio have been spreading.

In response, UN agencies and NGOs have launched immunisation campaigns in rebel-held parts of the country's north and east.

The children who died were among tens of thousands living in Idlib and Deir al-Zour [Dayr az Zawr] provinces who had been given a 2nd round of measles vaccines since Monday [15 Sep 2014].

A doctor at a clinic in the town of Jarjanaz said the infants had exhibited signs of severe shock about an hour after they had been given the injections, with many suffocating to death as their bodies swelled.

On Wednesday evening [17 Sep 2014], the National Coalition said a preliminary investigation had found atracurium, a muscle relaxant used in surgery, was administered.

The error was believed to have occurred because the packaging of the atracurium was similar to that of the solution used to mix the measles vaccine, the Guardian newspaper reported.

The immunisation programme was suspended following the incident and the health minister of the opposition interim government resigned. Officials said the investigation was continuing to find out who was responsible, with inquiries now reportedly focused on clinical negligence.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said it had "provided a team of experts to provide assistance in investigating this event" but that it was vital that immunisation efforts resumed in Syria as soon as possible.

[From the 2nd report above, following investigations, it appears as though the number of children who received atracurium was approximately 75, of whom 15 died (case fatality rate 20 percent).

Atracurium is a neuromuscular blocking agent that is used as an anesthetic, when accompanied by intubation (placement of a breathing tube in the patient's trachea to facilitate breathing) for the duration of action of the atracurium. Information from the NIH daily med drug information site revealed that reports of overdosage of the drug were anecdotal. As the drug was not administered as an anesthetic, it seems appropriate to consider the accidental administration of this drug as an overdose. For pediatric cases, it mentioned the following:

"Overdosage may increase the risk of histamine release and cardiovascular effects, especially hypotension. If cardiovascular support is necessary, this should include proper positioning, fluid administration, and the use of vasopressor agents if necessary. The patient's airway should be assured, with manual or mechanical ventilation maintained as necessary. A longer duration of neuromuscular block may result from overdosage and a peripheral nerve stimulator should be used to monitor recovery. Recovery may be facilitated by administration of an anticholinesterase reversing agent such as neostigmine, edrophonium, or pyridostigmine, in conjunction with an anticholinergic agent such as atropine or glycopyrrolate. The appropriate package inserts should be consulted for prescribing information" (http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=ca9e266c-8264-46f4-9df3-8d86a9d8437f).

Presumably, intervention with intubation or external breathing combined with management for a presumed anaphylaxis reaction may have helped to keep the fatality rate to 20 percent.

One suspects this was an unfortunate and tragic human error where atracurium was distributed with vaccine vials erroneously. What is difficult to understand is how this occurred in more than one vaccination center simultaneously, as the 2 provinces mentioned are not geographically contiguous. One hopes that it will not result in decreased confidence in the vaccination activities in Syria, having recently dealt with a polio epidemic related to importation of the wild poliovirus (WPV) into zones where vaccination activities had been interrupted due to civil unrest.
