A hive of honey bees has been destroyed at an apiary in the Highlands after the insects were found to be infected with the disease, American Foulbrood (AFB). AFB was confirmed at the apiary at Scaniport, near Inverness, on Friday [19 Aug 2016].

There is no permitted treatment in the UK for the disease, which kills bee larvae.

The Scottish government said there was a ban in place on the movement of bees and related equipment from the affected area.

[American Foulbrood (AFB) is caused by _Paenibacillus larvae_, a spore-forming gram-positive bacterium. AFB is a severe and notiÔ¨Åable disease of honey bees. _P. larvae_ is endemic to bee colonies worldwide. Spores are highly resilient and can survive in honey for years.

The infection can be transmitted to larvae by nurse bees or by spores remaining at the base of a brood cell. The susceptibility of larvae to AFB disease decreases with increasing age. Larvae cannot be infected later than 53 hours after the egg has hatched.

Larvae can be killed rapidly at an early age when they are curled at the base of uncapped brood cells. Adult worker bees will remove these dead larvae leaving only an empty cell. Other larvae will die later on in their development, when they are in an upright position, filling most of the brood cell. Often the larvae or pupae will die after brood cell capping.
