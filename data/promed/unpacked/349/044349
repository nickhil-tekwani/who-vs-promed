BABESIOSIS - SPAIN: REQUEST FOR REAGENTS
****************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: E.Pallas <Star@Arrakis.es>

We are testing the seroprevalence of human babesiosis in our geographical
area (Galicia, northest Spain) where animal babesiosis occurs at a very
elevated index [prevalence].
To this aim we started this study in October during 1996 and that can be
resumed in differents phases:
1) We have studied our habitat´s ticks. The most abundant and prevalent
species were _Ixodes ricinus_, _Ixodes hexagonus_, _Dermacentor
reticulatus_, _Dermacentor marginatus_, _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_ &
_Rhipicephalus bursa_.
2) We observed that babesiosis is prevalent in samples of the hemolymph of
captured ticks. The collected ticks and hemolymph have been sent to Dr.
Estrada, professor of Parasitology in Zaragoza University (Spain) and
member of EUCALB (European Union Concerted Action on Lyme Borreliosis) for
their identification.
3) We have studied all the cases on canine babesiosis received in our
laboratory from October, 1996 (308 to date). These cases have been
preserved by peripheral blood smears and the serum and plasma have been
frozen. These studies have disclosed the prevalence of _Babesia canis
canis_ and in a lesser number of _Babesia gibsoni_.
4) The babesiosis have been studied in other animals, cattle (_Babesia
bovis_ and _B. divergens_), equines (_B. equi_ and _B. caballi_), rodents
(_B. microti_). For instance, the seropositivity rates were as high as 48%
in serologic testing of healthy horses (_B. equi_ and _B. caballi_).
Although the cases published in Spain of symptomatic babesiosis have been
only 4 at the moment (3 on splenectomized patients or with some
disturbances in their immunity, and 1 in an immunocompetent patient with a
similar clinical signs to a mononucleosis syndrome and where stained blood
smears revealed numerous babesia parasites), we suspect the existence of
many cases with asymptomatic or subclinical forms due to the high
prevalence in cattle and domestic animals.
We planned to further these studies with the antigen of _Babesia divergens_
(most of the cases that have been published in Europe were for this
babesia) produced by Dr. Jongejan from the veterinary Faculty in Utrecht
but technical difficulties have made it impossible to obtain this antigen.
The aim of this study is to include the babesioses in the unknown fevers
group and at the same time, due to the high AIDS incidence in our
community, we think that babesiosis could be a serious potential risk for
these patients.
But for the reason given we are halted. We need to obtain this antigen as
soon as possible. At the same time we wonder if it would be possible to
screen using a common _Babesia_ sp. antigen, by immunofluorescent antibody
testing, ELISA or PCR.
Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.
