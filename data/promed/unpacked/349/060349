The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment is reporting the 2nd case of human plague in the state during this summer [2020]. The case, reported to the department on 3 Sep [2020], is a resident from a rural county in Colorado. The 1st case was diagnosed earlier this summer in a resident from southwest Colorado. The cases are unrelated. Both cases had exposure to sick animals: a squirrel and a cat [respectively]. Neither case is suspected of having spread the infection to other people or animals. These are the 1st cases of human plague reported in the state since 2015. In the past 10 years, there have been 14 cases of human plague in Colorado.

Earlier this year [2020], plague bacteria were confirmed in rodents in Broomfield, Jefferson, and Adams counties as well as a cat in Elbert County.

CDPHE reminds residents that it is not uncommon for plague to be seen this time of year, but it can also be found in rodents year-round. It sometimes spills over into other wildlife species as well as domestic cats and dogs.

People should take the following precautions to protect themselves and their pets:
- Do not directly handle any wildlife.
- Keep pets away from wildlife, especially dead rodents and rabbits.
- Don't let dogs or cats hunt prairie dogs, squirrels, voles, other rodents, or rabbits.
- Don't allow pets to roam freely.
- Treat all pets for fleas according to a veterinarian's advice.
- If your pet develops a sudden illness after contact with wildlife, call a veterinarian immediately.
- Do not feed wildlife. This attracts them to your property, brings them in close contact, and increases the risk of disease transmission.
- Do not attempt to remove or kill prairie dogs. This may increase the risk of plague for you and your domestic animals.
- Be aware of rodent and rabbit populations in your area and report sudden die-offs or multiple dead animals to your local health department.

Plague is most commonly spread to people by the bite of an infected flea but also may be transmitted by infected animal tissues, fluids, or respiratory droplets. Infected fleas may be found near areas where multiple rodents or rabbits have died; avoiding these areas and not allowing pets or other animals to explore these areas will decrease the risk of getting plague. Citizens with direct exposure to fleas or wildlife in the affected areas may be at risk. People who think they have been exposed should contact a healthcare provider immediately. Symptoms include sudden fever, headache, chills, weakness, and tender, painful lymph nodes. While there are no publicly available vaccines to prevent plague in people, if caught early, it can be successfully treated with antimicrobials in both people and pets.

[The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being infected.

When bubonic plague is left untreated or occurring without a bubo (which makes the diagnosis more difficult to make initially), plague bacteria invade the bloodstream (septicemic plague). As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. About 14% (one in 7) of all plague cases in the United States are fatal (https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Departments-and-Agencies/DPH/dph/communications/CERC/PlagueFSwebpdf.pdf).

The clinical manifestations of the human case and those of the cat are not stated here. Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat-fight abscess. If one lives in a plague-endemic area, please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.

Be sure to consult your veterinarian if you find a lump on your pet, as well as to get the best flea prevention treatment for your pet. It may be necessary to have your yard and/or home treated for fleas. Vacuum your home, including any bedding and furniture, and immediately upon finishing take the vacuum back outside, seal it in a plastic bag, and dispose of it. This type of cleaning will have to be repeated every week for 4-6 weeks to break the cycle of the flea in the home. - Mod.LL
