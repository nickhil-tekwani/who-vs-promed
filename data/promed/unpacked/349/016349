UN officials say Nigeria has seen more than 1500 deaths from cholera
in 2010, doubling the government's most recent fatality count.

Geneva-based UNICEF spokeswoman Marixie Mercado said Monday [25 Oct
2010] that as of 20 Oct 2010, there were 1555 deaths in Nigeria from
the waterborne disease, with 38 173 cases recorded in 2010 alone.

According to the WHO, the current outbreak is the worst in Nigeria
since 1991, when 7654 people died.

[2] Cholera - Benin

Two thirds of the African nation of Benin is underwater, with at
least 43 people killed and nearly 100 000 made homeless.

Heavy rain began falling at the start of October 2010, and the Oueme
and Mono rivers soon overflowed. Thousands of hectares of land,
mostly used for growing rice and other vegetables are now underwater.

The UN's children's fund, UNICEF, reports 800 cases of cholera and
warns of the risk of other waterborne diseases.

[6] Cholera - Central Africa: WHO

The current wave of cholera outbreaks affecting Central Africa
started a few months ago. As of 3 Oct 2010, 40 468 cases and 1879
deaths have been reported in 4 countries (Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and
Nigeria). Seasonal factors, such as the rainy season with flooding,
as well as poor hygiene conditions and population movements in the
area contribute to this unusually high incidence of cholera.
Nevertheless this area known to be endemic for cholera is regularly
affected by small outbreaks.

Breakdown by country
Cameroon
--------
7869 cases including 515 deaths (case fatality rate CFR 6.5 percent)
have been reported in 6 regions (Centre, Extreme Nord, Littoral,
Nord, Ouest, Sud Ouest) between 6 May and 3 Oct 2010. The majority of
cases (97 percent) are reported from the Extreme Nord region.
Preventive and control measures are ongoing. A Cholera Command and
Control Centre has been set up in Maroua in the Extreme Nord region
by the Ministry of Health with the support from WHO as health cluster
lead and in close collaboration with other health and water and
sanitation partners.

Chad
----
2508 cases including 111 deaths (CFR 4.4 percent) are reported in 12
health districts in 6 regions between 13 Jul and 3 Oct 2010.
Prevention and control measures are being implemented by national
authorities with support from several partners (Medecins Sans
Frontieres (MSF), National Red Cross, Oxfam, The International Rescue
Committee (IRC), International Medical Corps (IMC), UNICEF, WHO).

Niger
-----
976 cases including 62 deaths (CFR 6.4 percent) have been reported in
Diffa, Maradi, Tahoua, and Zinder regions between 3 Jul and 1 Oct
2010. Preventive and control measures are ongoing.

Nigeria
-------
29 115 cases including 1191 deaths (CFR 4.1 percent) have been
reported between 4 Jan and 3 Oct 2010, in 144 LGAs [local government
areas] in 15 states including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).
The outbreak is still ongoing and spreading to new geographical
areas. Severe flooding and displacement of large numbers of people
have occurred, aggravating the situation.

[7] Diarrhea - South Africa (Free State)
Date: Thu 21 Oct 2010

<http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/article720890.ece/300-diarrhoea-cases-in-Kroonstad>


The Free State health department expressed concern over the high
number of diarrhea cases experienced in the Moqhaka Local
Municipality. Provincial health spokesman Jabu Mbalula said a task
team was formed with the district municipality to address the
situation of water safety, which focused on the Kroonstad region.

"We got concerned after people complained and found as a result that
the municipality's water, which people are using, is not purified."
Mbalula said more than 300 diarrhea cases were recorded recently in
the Kroonstad, Steynsrus, and Viljoenskroon areas.

[8] Cholera - Papua New Guinea (Central)
Date: Mon 4 Oct 2010
Source: The National [edited]
<http://www.thenational.com.pg/?q=node/13008>


Central's West Hiri district is beginning to record a high number of
suspected cholera cases, according to Central health authorities.
Hiri district health coordinator, Michael Masket said yesterday [3
Oct 2010] when arriving back from the affected area that 8 patients
from Papa in severe conditions were admitted to the cholera treatment
centre (CTC) at the Papa clinic while only 3 came from Lealea.

He said the situation was getting worse with people coming to the CTC
in severe conditions. "It's not over yet, when it (cholera) comes, it
spreads fast. Every day the CTC is seeing 5 to 6 severe cases," Masket said.

Another problem that Masket pointed out was the capacity to house the patients.

[9] Cholera - India (Kashmir)

One person died and 15 others were hospitalized after an outbreak of
cholera in the remote village of Hallan in Verinag of south Kashmir's
Islamabad district on Sat 25 Sep 2010.

Locals said that the disease occurred 2 days ago after consuming
tap-water from a tank constructed by the Public Health Engineering
[PHE] Department. However, PHE officials denied the sayings of
public. "The locals are using water from a nearby spring whose water
got contaminated by the recent heavy downpour in the hills, while the
water supplied by PHE from the tank reservoir is completely safe. The
entire reservoir is closed from all sides, so there is no question of
water getting contaminated in it," said assistant executive engineer,
PHE sub-division Dooru-Verinag.

Source: Monsters and Critics, Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA) report [edited]
<http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/health/news/article_1586750.php/Baby-dies-in-Germany-of-cholera-caught-in-Pakistan>


A baby has died in Germany, apparently of cholera he caught during
his family's stay in Pakistan, health authorities said Fri 24 Sep 2010.

Since cholera epidemics in Germany a century ago, the disease has
practically disappeared from the country, with the annual case rate
varying up to 3.

6 people who had been in contact with the 9-month-old boy, who died
in a Frankfurt hospital, have been put under quarantine, but have
shown no signs of the disease
