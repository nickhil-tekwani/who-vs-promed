Those following the story of _Strep. suis_ disease in people might be
interested in a reference which provides a broader context for the
discussions:
Arends JP and Zanen HC. Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis in humans.
Rev. Inf. Dis. 1988; 10:131-137.
It reviews cases from from 1968 to 1985 in the Netherlands.
_Strep. suis_ is ubiquitous in swine, with over 30 serotypes identified.
Most human and swine disease has implicated S. suis type 2, although other
serotypes are occasionally isolated from cases. Wide variability in
virulence occurs among isolates of serotype 2. Arends and Zanen provided the
following magic numbers (with very wide confidence intervals):
Average age of cases: 49
Male to female ratio: 6.5:1
83% of cases employed in the pork industry.
Relative risk for pork industry workers estimated to be 1500 relative to
people not in the industry
Case fatality rate: 7% (2 cases)
BUT -
ESTIMATED ANNUAL RISK OF DEVELOPING _Strep. suis_ MENINGITIS FOR PORK
INDUSTRY WORKERS = 3/100 000 years
_Strep. suis_ is a well recognized occupational risk for pork industry
workers, but appears to be very rare -- albeit potentially serious for the
affected individuals. Human infection is thought to occur mostly via skin
cuts.
Sporadic reports of individual cases are to be anticipated, and are unlikely
to have significant public health implications. Appropriate education of
industry workers is important.
