Ghanaian authorities have begun destroying more than 200 000 pigs to
contain the outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF) in the greater Accra and
the central regions. The ministry of food and agriculture began the
safeguard measure at the weekend after it banned the slaughtering, sale and
movement of pigs in and out of the 2 regions in October following the
outbreak of the disease, which initially killed about 700 pigs. A source at
the agriculture ministry described the outbreak as a "national disaster".
The source said Tema and Ashaiman in the greater Accra and the Awutu
Bawjiase area in the central region are the worst affected. The 300 000 US
dollars earmarked by the World Bank and FAO to pay compensation to affected
farmers was inadequate. The source pointed out most farmers would be unable
to restart their farms with the promised compensation since most of them
are maintaining their animals at a very high cost and cannot recover their
loss.
"It is a sad event watching your animals being killed at a go with the
capital investment vanishing and yet destroying them is the only solution,"
one farmer cried.
