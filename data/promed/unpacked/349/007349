Comment on the ProMED-mail post: "CJD, possible association with BSE"
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I want to make a brief comment on the report from the Guardian saying that
mice expressing the human PrP-gene may develop the picture of classical
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) or the picture of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE).
The possibility of pathogen transmission from bovines to humans has existed
for many years before the appearance of BSE. It must be realized that the
production of smallpox vaccine and its use in humans was accompanied by
introduction of crude bovine proteins into the human skin. This type of
vaccine was administered for more than 100 years to most children on the
northern hemisphere. The vaccine was produced in calves, but passages in
sheep or in rabbits were also made to prevent the accumulation of some
pathogens. The smallpox vaccination might have been a cause of sporadic
cases of CJD in humans as long as it was routinely applied.

Further comment: case definition
--------------------------------
In the context of the questions raised by the ProMED-mail post: "CJD,
possible association with BSE", I think it is extremely important to
clarify the demarcation between sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)
and new variant CJD [abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var,) in ProMED-mail].
Clearly it would have major ramifications for the description of human
prion disease, since it changes the basic case definition for the condition.
Specifically, [I wish to draw attention to] publications concerning the
cluster of CJD cases associated with the ongoing problems with dura mater
grafts between 1979 and 1999. There are 2 points which are relevant to the
question of how distinct vCJD and classic CJD really are.
(1) In a review of 57 cases, it was noted that the clinical symptoms of
these patients were not those expected for sporadic CJD; more cerebellar
ataxia, visual disturbance, and disorientation (1).
(2) These cases had some micropathology similar to that considered
characteristic of vCJD , specifically "florid" type PrP plaques surrounded
by spongiform change in multiple areas of the brain (2).
There is evidence from outbreak experience, therefore, which suggests the
overlap needs to be looked at critically using the current case definitions.
