The recovery of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae from pediatric
patients with chronic otitis media has been well-described in the literature.
A few citations:
1. MMWR, 1994;43:23-6, 31
2. Antimicrob. Agents Chemotherap., 1992, 36:1703-1707
3. Antimicrob. Agents Chemotherap., 1995, 39:271-272
In my own laboratory the percentage of pneumococcal clinical isolates that
show high level resistance to penicillin (MIC >2 ug/ml) is 15%, many of these
isolates have been recovered from middle ear effusions from children.

I am certainly not the best person to discuss this (for example, Drs. Mason
and Kaplan, who have done many of the studies in this area, are just down the
street from me at Texas Children's Hospital), but I can provide some
information.
First, _S. pneumoniae_ is definitely the most common bacteria associated with
otitis media in kids. In most studies, it is found in 30-40% of all kids
with otitis media. The second most common organism recovered is _Haemophilus
influenzae_, with _M. catarrhalis_ a distant third.
Second, resistance of _S. pneumoniae_ to penicillin is a very well described
phenomenon. The prevalence of this has been increasing over the past 15-20
years in various parts of the world, with recognition of this in the US over
the past 5-10 years. There are usually two levels of resistance mentioned:
intermediate resistance refers to organisms for which the MIC of penicillin
is 0.1 - 1.0 ug/ml, while high-level resistance refers to organisms with a
penicillin MIC >1.0 ug/ml. There is some clinical significance to this
difference, as patients infected with intermediately resistant isolates can
often be treated with high doses of penicillin, while those with highly
resistant isolates are not. The prevalence of penicillin resistance varies
geographically, but overall is probably greater than 10% of isolates in the
US, the majority of which have intermediate resistance. However, the
prevalence of highly resistant isolates is increasing, and some of these are
also developing resistance to other antibiotics used for treatment, such as
third-generation cephalosporins.
Penicillin-resistant _S. pneumoniae_ is a well described cause of otitis
media.

This is clearly not the first [resistant] _Streptococcus pneumoniae_
reported. I refer subscribers to: Centers for Disease Control. Drug
Resistant Streptococcus Pneumoniae- Kentucky and Tennessee, 1993. MMWR
1994;43:23-25 in which 361 children with otitis media were described. Of
those 110 were positive for pneumococci of those 32 had penicillin resistance
(>2.0 mcg/ml).

An increasing prevalence of _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ with decreased
susceptibility to penicillin have been recognized throughout the current
decade. The patterns of resistance are separated into "low-level resistance"
(with MICs against penicillin of 0.1 to 1.0 ug/ml) and "high-level resistance"
(with MICs > 1.0 ug/ml. It is for the most part assumed that these strains
will be resistant to first and second generation cephalosporins. In
addition, approximately 1/3 of these strains may also be resistant to 3rd
generation cephalosporins (e.g., cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). The mechanism of
penicillin-resistance in pneumococci is due to a change in the affinity of a
penicillin-binding protein for penicillin.
This is certainly not the first report of penicillin-resistant _S.
pneumoniae_ being recovered from the middle ear. Currently, it has been
reported that between 10 and 50% of middle ear isolates of pneumococci will be
resistant (approximately 1/3 low-level, 2/3 high-level). This varies with
the age of the child, prior exposure to antibiotics and attendance in day-
care.
The resistance tends to be found in those serogroups of pneumococci most
likely associated with clinical disease (e.g., SG 6, SG 19, SG 23, etc). The
resistance spread appears to be by diverse "clones" of bacteria, and not due
to spread of a single, resistant clone.

Dr. Kelsey rightly points out that the pneumococcus is always the most
common, or one of the most common, bacterial causes of both acute and chronic
otitis media in children (see also work by Bluestone, Liu, Chonmaitree &
Howie, and others). Moreover, a number of investigators have clearly
demonstrated that nearly all cases of childhood otitis have an infectious
etiology. It is also correct to state that penicillin-resistant strains are
responsible for an increasing percentage of those childhood infections
caused by pneumococci (e.g., PC Appelbaum, Clin. Infect. Dis 15:77). Because
of the increasing frequency with which both intermediately and highly
penicillin-resistant pneumococcal strains are causing *acute* otitis media
(we certainly see them here in Galveston), one could easily extrapolate that
these same kinds of strains should be appearing with increasing frequency in
cultures of middle ear fluids from patients with *chronic* otitis media.
This was in fact first reported some years ago by Mills et al. (Clin.
Otolaryngol. 10(6):335-341).
It is important here, in my opinion, not to kill the messenger. What I mean
is that it is possible that many of the attendees at the meeting where the
findings of this study are being presented (American Academy of
Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery Foundation) will not have heard the
message that penicllin or even third-generation cephalosporin antibiotics no
longer constitute automatically effective prophylaxis or therapy against ear
infections due to pneumococci.

[I have no idea why the original report was considered sufficiently
innovative or unique as to be worthy of a press release. Clearly, penicillin
resistance is rapidly increasing in incidence among pneumococci. As a
result, there is increasing interest in serotyping of this organism. I
understand that the number of technicians in the CDC Streptococcal Reference
Laboratory has been reduced. At present, non-emergency requests for _S.
pneumoniae_ serotyping can be done in Dr. Watson's laboratory, which
routinely types isolates for a fee. Screening includes P disk screening,
bile solubility testing, macroscopic coagglutination serotyping, and quellung
reactions for typing within groups. This service might serve as a temporary
substitute for those who have no other means of having their pneumococci
(genus _Streptococcus_) isolates typed. -- Mod CHC]
