Penang state health executive councilor Dr Afif Bahardin says 3 cases of Japanese encephalitis in Penang come from different areas in the state, suggesting that the infections did not come from a common source.

[Of these 3 cases], 2 cases come from George Town and Bagan Jermal in north Seberang Perai. In the 3rd case, infection is believed to have happened in Tasek Gelugor.

"There are no abattoirs or pig farms in George Town and Bagan Jermal," Dr Alif told a press conference today [4 Jul 2014].

Pigs are reservoirs for the virus that causes the disease, but the _Culex_ mosquito is responsible for passing the virus from pigs to humans. He said Penang will take steps to quarantine farms in which pigs test positive for the virus.

For now, the most important step is to conduct fogging to get rid of mosquitoes.

Dr Afif said that although pigs are reservoirs for the JE virus, other animals can also be reservoirs, such as wild birds, horses, buffaloes and even chickens. Nevertheless, test samples have been taken from 20 pig farms in Kampung Selamat and Tasek Gelugor, which are within a one-km radius from the school where the 12-year-old boy contracted the disease. The results are expected today [4 Jul 2014].

Dr Afif also expressed concerns that the Health Ministry and the State Health Department did not inform the state government, the veterinary department, and the local councils about the disease quickly.

[It is not clear why this 4 Jul 2014 report was so late in coming to ProMED-mail. However, the information adds to the previous report this year (2014) of JEV infections in Malaysia, including in Penang state. The Malay peninsula is well within the endemic area of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV).

A 7 Jul 2014 report indicated that 17 JE cases have been reported nationwide, of which 8 were reported in Sarawak, 4 in Sabah, 3 in Penang and one each in Selangor and Kelantan, of which 4 had been fatal (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140708.2593333).

Pigs can serve as amplifying hosts of JEV, but the reservoirs are birds, especially ardeids. The quarantine imposed on pig farms with animals that are JEV antibody positive presumably is an attempt to avoid transport of viremic individuals that might spread the virus to other localities. Fogging, especially if done just one time, is unlikely to have a long-term reduction of vector mosquito populations. _Culex_ mosquitoes that transmit JEV breed in localized as well as extensive wet areas, including rice fields. There is no indication that people or pigs in the area have been vaccinated against JEV. Vaccines for both are available in high risk areas.
