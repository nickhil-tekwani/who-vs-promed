The recent observation that Japan notified 7 non-fatal imported cases of
cholera with dates of onset between 20 May & 28 June 2001 [ProMED-mail 31
Jul 2001 has yielded the following comment.
As far as I know (often discussed in meetings of the International Society
for Travel Medicine) a check for cholera is (or at least was recently)
mandatory for all Japanese travellers returning from an "endemic" region.
The check consists of routine examniation of stool specimens or rectal
swabs collected at airports. Japan may have the strictest surveillance
system worldwide, and the findings may not be associated with clinical
signs of disease.

[I had never heard of this rather drastic health check of returning
nationals, which might not be acceptable in all countries. We still have no
further information on the strain and origin of these cases. - Mod.JW
