Indian rabies statistics should be interpreted with care. The 1993 WHO
Eighth Report on the World Health Situation authoritatively estimated 30,000
deaths from rabies in the whole of Asia, including China (p.113). India's
mortality statistics indicated that, remarkably, a large percentage of
"rabies" cases were not fatal -- clearly many cases of dog bite are being
recorded in incidence statistics as "rabies." Perhaps the figure reflects
the number of people treated with rabies vaccine.
If the recording situation in India has changed in this respect since 1993,
we would be glad to hear about it.
