[1] Pfizer: New treatment -- protease inhibitor pill
Date: Wed 24 Mar 2021 15:10 GST

https://english.alarabiya.net/coronavirus/2021/03/24/Coronavirus-Pfizer-begins-human-testing-of-new-COVID-19-pill


Pfizer Inc. said it has begun human safety testing of a new pill to treat the coronavirus that could be used at the 1st sign of illness. If it succeeds in trials, the pill could be prescribed early in an infection to block viral replication before patients get very sick. The drug binds to an enzyme called a protease to keep the virus from replicating. Protease-inhibiting medicines have been successful in treating other types of viruses, include HIV and hepatitis C.

"Given the way that SARS-CoV-2 is mutating and the continued global impact of COVID-19, it appears likely that it will be critical to have access to therapeutic options both now and beyond the pandemic," said Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer's Chief Scientific Officer, in a statement.

In an interview, Dolsten said no unexpected problems had been seen in the study so far and that it could generate results within weeks. The new protease inhibitor is the 2nd such medicine Pfizer has brought into human trials to treat COVID-19. Pfizer is testing another given intravenously to hospitalized virus patients.

Easy-to-use treatments are lacking for early-stage COVID-19 patients. While antibody therapies from Eli Lilly & Co. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. are authorized in the USA for COVID patients who haven't yet been hospitalized but are at high risk of developing severe symptoms, they must be infused in the hospital or at a doctor's office.

That has created logistical challenges that have limited their use. Other therapies are intended for sicker people: Gilead Sciences Inc.'s antiviral drug remdesivir must be infused over several days and is approved only for hospitalized patients.

Among major drug makers, Merck & Co. has one of the few coronavirus pills that is far along in human testing. Its experimental antiviral drug molnupiravir works by a different mechanism than the Pfizer drug and is in late-stage human trials. Merck is developing its drug in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP.

If everything continues to go well, Pfizer could begin a much larger combined phase 2-phase 3 trial early in the 2nd quarter, Dolsten said, potentially allowing it to apply for emergency-use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration by the end of this year [2021], depending on how the pandemic evolves. The drug is likely to be given twice a day for about 5 days, he said.

"This is really a potential game changer," Dolsten said.

While initial efficacy testing will focus on people with early infections, Pfizer also plans to explore whether the drug works to protect healthy people who have been exposed to the coronavirus, such as family members or roommates who live with someone who got sick.

Dolsten said Pfizer's oral protease inhibitor, code-named PF-07321332, had a number of potential advantages. In lab tests, it worked against many coronaviruses, including the original SARS virus and MERS. Additionally, the coronavirus protease doesn't mutate much, which means the therapy is likely to work equally well against numerous variant strains, he said.

In theory, the protease inhibitor could also be combined with other antiviral drugs, such as the one Merck is developing, Dolsten said. Pfizer said it plans to share more data on the compound at the American Chemical Society meeting on 6 Apr 2021.

[The new treatment being evaluated is a protease inhibitor in the form of a pill. This would be a significant improvement over the invasive procedures being used to treat patients with COVID now. It also appears to be broadly reactive, effective against SARS and MERS, thus will likely also work against SARS-CoV-2 variant strains. - Mod.LK]

[2] Long haulers
[A] COVID-19 recovery centers
Date: Tue 23 Mar 2021

The United States should create multispecialty COVID-19 clinics dedicated to treating patients still experiencing serious multiorgan effects of infection well after recovery from acute illness, say the authors of a comprehensive review of literature on so-called coronavirus "long-haulers" published yesterday [22 Mar 2021] in Nature Medicine.

An estimated 28 million long-haul COVID-19 cases have been reported in the United States, but the researchers said that many patients struggle in silence or become frustrated when their doctors don't consider that their symptoms could be related to their previous infection.

The review, led by researchers at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, found that the cell damage, inflammatory immune response, abnormal blood clotting, and other complications of acute COVID-19 infection can leave in their wake long-term symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, "brain fog," fatigue, joint pain, and posttraumatic stress disorder, all of which can compromise quality of life.

The researchers detailed literature from the United States, Europe, and China on high percentages of long-haulers, or those with chronic or post-COVID-19 syndrome, who often have debilitating symptoms for more than 3 months. COVID-19 has been associated with diabetes, strokes, heart rhythm abnormalities, blood clots in the lungs, and other complications.

For example, an observational study of 488 COVID-19 patients released from Michigan hospitals after 60 days who completed a phone survey found that 32.6% had lingering symptoms, including 18.9% who reported new or worsening symptoms. The most common issues were shortness of breath while walking up stairs (22.9%), cough (15.4%), and loss of smell or taste (13.1%).

Similarly, 87.4% of 143 COVID-19 patients released from a hospital in Italy reported persistent symptoms, including fatigue (53.1%), shortness of breath (43.4%), joint pain (27.3%), and chest pain (21.7%), with 55% still experiencing at least 3 symptoms a mean of 60 days after symptom onset.

And a study from France of 150 survivors of noncritical COVID-19 found that two-thirds reported persistent symptoms at 60 days follow-up, with one-third saying they felt worse than they did when their acute coronavirus symptoms began.

In China, 6-month post-acute follow-up of 1733 COVID-19 patients found at least one lingering symptom in 76%, with fatigue/muscle weakness in 63%, sleep problems in 26%, and anxiety/depression in 23%. About half of 349 patients who underwent high-resolution chest computed tomography showed at least one abnormal pattern.

While long-haul syndrome often occurs in people with underlying health problems, it also affects previously healthy people, senior study author Elaine Wan, MD, said in a Columbia University news release. "I have seen young patients, weeks even months after COVID-19 infection, and they've suddenly developed new onset of heart racing, palpitations, and chronic fatigue," she said, adding that other patients report new chest discomfort or difficulty with decision making, memory, and concentration.

Wan said that COVID-19 is the 1st infectious disease that she has seen that affects so many organs. "It's changed my clinical practice," she said. "No matter what the patient comes in for, I now ask if they ever had COVID-19 infection. It changes the possible range of diagnoses."

Lead author Ani Nalbandian, MD, said in the release that she encourages potential long-haulers to insist on appropriate recognition and treatment. "Get in touch with your doctors even if you're not sure if your symptoms are lingering from your COVID infection," she said. "The situation is still fluid, and we're learning more every month."

Physician cooperation with patient advocacy groups, sharing of data, and participation in longitudinal clinical trials are also essential, the authors said in the study. "Necessary active and future research include the identification and characterization of key clinical, serological, imaging, and epidemiologic features of COVID-19 in the acute, subacute, and chronic phases of disease, which will help us to better understand the natural history and pathophysiology of this new disease entity," they wrote.

The researchers called for the creation of dedicated COVID-19 clinics, similar to those popping up in Italy, and prioritization of those at high risk for long-term symptoms, such as those of advanced age or with severe acute infection requiring intensive care, pre-existing respiratory illness, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, chronic cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, organ transplant, or active cancer.

"It is clear that care for patients with COVID-19 does not conclude at the time of hospital discharge, and interdisciplinary cooperation is needed for comprehensive care of these patients in the outpatient setting," they wrote.

One academic medical center, the Brigham Lung Center, recently opened the COVID Recovery Center for these patients, according to a Dana-Farber Cancer Institute news release. But doing so has been difficult because physicians are still attending to new coronavirus patients, Nalbandian said in the Columbia release. "Clinics could prioritize follow-up care for those at high risk for post-acute COVID-19 and those with the highest burden of persistent symptoms," she said.

[B] Neurologic sequelae
Date: Tue 23 Mar 2021
Source: The New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/health/long-covid-symptoms.html?smid =tw-share


In the fall [2020], after [SK] came down with a mild case of COVID-19, she expected to recover and return to her previous energetic life in Chicago. After all, she was just 25, and healthy.

But weeks later, she said, "this weird constellation of symptoms began to set in." She had blurred vision encircled with strange halos. She had ringing in her ears, and everything began to smell like cigarettes or Lysol. One leg started to tingle, and her hands would tremble while putting on eyeliner.

She also developed "really intense brain fog," she said. Trying to concentrate on a call for her job in financial services, she felt as if she had just come out of anesthesia. And during a debate about politics with her husband, [ZH], "I didn't remember what I was trying to say or what my stance was," she said.

By the end of the year [2020], [SK] was referred to a special clinic for COVID-related neurological symptoms at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, which has been evaluating and counseling hundreds of people from across the country who are experiencing similar problems.

Now, the clinic, which sees about 60 new patients a month, in-person and via telemedicine, has published the 1st study [see reference below] focused on long-term neurological symptoms in people who were never physically sick enough from COVID-19 to need hospitalization, including [SK].

The study of 100 patients from 21 states, published on Tuesday [23 Mar 2021] in The Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology, found that 85% of them experienced 4 or more neurological issues like brain fog, headaches, tingling, muscle pain and dizziness.

"We are seeing people who are really highly, highly functional individuals, used to multitasking all the time and being on top of their game, but, all of a sudden, it's really a struggle for them," said Dr. Igor J. Koralnik, the chief of neuro-infectious diseases and global neurology at Northwestern Medicine, who oversees the clinic and is the senior author of the study.

The report, in which the average patient age was 43, underscores the emerging understanding that for many people, long COVID can be worse than their initial bouts with the infection, with a stubborn and complex array of symptoms.

This month [March 2021], a study that analyzed electronic medical records in California found that nearly one-third of the people struggling with long COVID symptoms -- like shortness of breath, cough and abdominal pain -- did not have any signs of illness in the first 10 days after they tested positive for the coronavirus. Surveys by patient-led groups have also found that many COVID-19 survivors with long-term symptoms were never hospitalized for the disease.

In the Northwestern study, many experienced symptoms that fluctuated or persisted for months. Most improved over time, but there was wide variation. "Some people after 2 months are 95% recovered, while some people after 9 months are only 10% recovered," said Dr. Koralnik. Five months after contracting the virus, patients estimated, they felt on average only 64% recovered.

Across the country, doctors who are treating people with post-COVID neurological symptoms say the study's findings echo what they have been seeing.

"We need to take this seriously," said Dr. Kathleen Bell, the chairwoman of the physical medicine and rehabilitation department at the University Texas Southwestern Medical Center, who was not involved in the new study. "We can either let people get worse and the situation gets more complicated, or we can really realize that we have a crisis."

Dr. Bell and Dr. Koralnik said many of the symptoms resembled those of people who had concussions or traumatic brain injuries or who had mental fogginess after chemotherapy.

In the case of COVID-19, Dr. Bell said, experts believe that the symptoms are caused by "an inflammatory reaction to the virus" that can affect the brain as well as the rest of the body. And it makes sense that some people experience multiple neurological symptoms simultaneously or in clusters, Dr. Bell said, because "there's only so much real estate in the brain, and there's a lot of overlap" in regions responsible for different brain functions.

"If you have inflammation disturbances," she said, "you can very well have cognitive effects and things like emotional effects. It's really hard to have one neurological problem without having multiple."

Dr. Allison P. Navis, a neuro-infectious disease specialist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York City who was not involved in the study, said that about 75% of her 200 post-COVID patients were experiencing issues like "depression, anxiety, irritability or some mood symptoms."

Participants in the study were overwhelmingly white, and 70% were women. Dr. Navis and others said that the lack of diversity quite likely reflected the demographics of people able to seek care relatively early in the pandemic rather than the full spectrum of people affected by post-COVID neurological symptoms.

"Especially in New York City, the majority of patients who got sick with COVID-19 are people of color and Medicaid patients, and that's absolutely not the patients one sees at the post-COVID center," Dr. Navis said. "The majority of patients are white, often they have private insurance, and I think we have to figure out a little bit more what's going on there with those disparities -- if it's purely just a lack of access or are symptoms being dismissed in people of color or if it's something else."

In the Northwestern study, Dr. Koralnik said that because coronavirus testing was difficult to obtain early in the pandemic, only half of the participants had tested positive for the coronavirus, but all had the initial physical symptoms of COVID-19. The study found very little difference between those who had tested positive and those who had not. Dr. Koralnik said that those who tested negative tended to contact the clinic about a month later in the course of the disease than those who tested positive, possibly because some had spent weeks being evaluated or trying to have their problems addressed by other doctors.

[SK] was among the participants who had a negative test for the virus, but she said she later tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, proof that she had been infected.

In the Northwestern study, 43% of the patients had depression before having COVID-19; 16% had previous autoimmune diseases, the same percentage of patients who had previous lung disease or had struggled with insomnia.

Experts cautioned that because the study was relatively small, these pre-existing conditions might or might not be representative of all long-term patients. "We are all seeing very small pieces of the elephant in terms of the long COVID group," Dr. Bell said. "Some of us are seeing tail; some of us are seeing trunk."

Along with neurological symptoms, 85% of the patients were experiencing fatigue, and nearly half had shortness of breath. Some also had chest pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, variable heart rate or blood pressure. Nearly half of the participants were experiencing depression or anxiety.

[SK] said that she experienced "heart palpitations if I just got up to open the curtains." Her cardiologist said she was the 5th previously healthy young person to walk into his office that week. In the beginning, her fatigue was so severe that walking 2 or 3 laps around her 600-square-foot [56 sq m] apartment would exhaust her for the rest of the day. In addition, she said that she had "really intense mood fluctuations that don't feel like they're mine."

"Waking up every day in this body, sometimes hope feels a little dangerous," said [SK], who will soon start the cognitive rehab program. "I have to wonder: Am I going to recover, or am I going to just figure out how to live with my new brain?"

Abstract
--------
"Objective: Most SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected individuals never require hospitalization. However, some develop prolonged symptoms. We sought to characterize the spectrum of neurologic manifestations in non‐hospitalized COVID‐19 'long haulers'.

"Methods: This is a prospective study of the first 100 consecutive patients (50 SARS‐CoV‐2 laboratory‐positive and 50 laboratory‐negative individuals) presenting to our Neuro‐COVID‐19 clinic between May and November 2020. Due to early pandemic testing limitations, patients were included if they met Infectious Diseases Society of America symptoms of COVID‐19, were never hospitalized for pneumonia or hypoxemia and had neurologic symptoms lasting over 6 weeks. We recorded the frequency of neurologic symptoms and analyzed patient‐reported quality of life measures and standardized cognitive assessments.

"Results: Mean age was 43.2+/-11.3 years, 70% were female and 48% were evaluated in televisits. The most frequent comorbidities were depression/anxiety (42%) and autoimmune disease (16%). The main neurologic manifestations were "brain fog" (81%), headache (68%), numbness/tingling (60%), dysgeusia (59%), anosmia (55%), myalgias (55%), with only anosmia being more frequent in SARS‐CoV‐2-positive than SARS‐CoV‐2‐negative patients (37/50 [74%] vs (18/50 [36%]; p less than 0.001). Moreover, 85% also experienced fatigue. There was no correlation between time from disease onset and subjective impression of recovery. Both groups exhibited impaired quality of life in cognitive and fatigue domains. SARS‐CoV‐2-positive patients performed worse in attention and working memory cognitive tasks compared with a demographic‐matched US population (T‐score 41.5 [37, 48.25] and 43 [37.5, 48.75], respectively; both p less than 0.01).

"Interpretation: Non‐hospitalized COVID‐19 'long haulers' experience prominent and persistent 'brain fog' and fatigue that affect their cognition and quality of life."

[3] Surge warning
Date: Mon 22 Mar 2021 11:58 EDT

Americans must recommit to wearing masks and taking other COVID-19 mitigation measures to avoid a new surge of the virus in the USA, a top health official said Monday [22 Mar 2021] as the White House signaled that shipments of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine could fall just short of an early target.

Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said cases have begun to rise slightly again, while hospital admissions remain stable and deaths continue to decline. Variants, which are in some cases more contagious or more dangerous, continue to spread, she said.

"Taken together, these statistics should serve as a warning sign for the American people," she said at a press briefing. "We must act now, and I am worried that if we don't take the right actions now, we will have another avoidable surge" as is being seen in Europe.

Walensky repeated a warning that states are lifting restrictions too early, and called on Americans to continue to wear masks, avoid crowds and wait to travel, even if they've been vaccinated. "I'm calling the American people to action, whether vaccinated or not, to recommit to doing the right thing -- take the steps we know work to stop COVID-19," she said.

The USA is continuing to ramp up vaccinations, recording back-to-back days this weekend of at least 3 million shots administered. Another official at the briefing, White House aide Andy Slavitt, said Johnson & Johnson would increase shipments this week of its one-shot vaccine and will come close to hitting its target of providing 20 million doses by the end of March [2021], though stopped short of saying the goal would be met.

"We are obviously working very closely with the company. We are going to see a nice increase in Johnson & Johnson this week," he said. "I wouldn't signal to you that they're going to be far away from the numbers they have projected, at all, give or take a little bit."

The administration has said that it expects to receive nearly all -- or all -- of its initial 100-million dose J&J order by the end of May [2021], though the company has only committed to providing it by the end of June. Biden has ordered another 100 million shots due in the second half of the year [2021].

[Perhaps because the vaccines seem so effective, perhaps because temperatures are warming in the regions with temperate climates in the northern hemisphere, perhaps people are weary of wearing masks -- whatever the reason, people have stopped being cautious and are intermingling with crowds without observing distancing or wearing masks. Travel is picking up again as people's confidence increases. This is likely to come back to haunt us and lead to a resurgence of cases. We are not out of the woods yet, what with highly transmissible variants and still a large proportion of unimmunized people. Furthermore, we do not have any hard data on how long immunity will last. It is important that the message to keep up one's guard be delivered by the media, the politicians, and health professionals, among others. - Mod.LK]

[4] Comments on [2] neutralizing antibody report in COVID-19 update (110): vaccines, neutralizing antibody, P1 variant, WHO, global 20210323.8263780 [edited]
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.09.21252641v1


What level of neutralising antibody protects from COVID-19?
Eskild Petersen: Reading through the abstract, it seems that the authors do not include the booster effect in their predictions on protection. We know well, for instance from hepatitis B, that you can be seronegative years after immunization but when exposed you produce high titers within 7 to 14 days. Thus, even if you lose titers over time, you could very well still be protected. That is why we need clinical studies following future COVID infection in immunised and previously infected persons.

Martin E. Hugh-Jones: We saw something very similar when we looked at oral vaccination with the Sterne vaccine. The sheep were fed massive doses mixed with crushed pecan nuts over 3 weekends. When serotested, there was nothing of significance. But after we injected them with Sterne, their seroresponse was far, far above that we noticed with the control sheep not fed Sterne after they were injected with Sterne. There was a benefit from the oral vaccine.

[ProMED thanks these moderators for submitting these comments, which are absolutely correct for many virus infections. Even after antibody is no longer detectable, memory B cells are present and quickly respond to new infection, protecting the host. It would be great if this were the case with SARS-CoV-2, but it is known that human coronaviruses repeatedly cause infection. - Mod.LK]
