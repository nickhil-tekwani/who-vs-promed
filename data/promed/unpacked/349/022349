Romania's Sanitary, Veterinary and Food Safety Authority (ANSVSA) announced Friday [24 Jun 2016] restrictions of imports of milk and dairy products from Bulgaria, justified by evolutions in the contagious bovine nodular dermatitis, also known as lumpy skin disease.

The measure concerns colostrum, non-pasteurized milk and dairy, cheeses, several types of yoghurt and some traditional products. The European Commission approved on 14 Jun [2016] the vaccination against nodular dermatitis of all cattle throughout Bulgaria, thus expanding the area set on 22 Apr [2016]; in accordance with World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE] regulation, the use of this vaccine is equivalent to designate a country as contaminated by the virus.

The ANSVSA announced Wednesday [22 Jun 2016] that there were 281 outbreaks of lumpy skin disease in the Balkans -- 173 in Bulgaria, 56 in Greece, 35 in Macedonia, and 17 in Serbia [see comment]. This places Romania in an immediate risk region, although no outbreaks have been reported.

[According to follow-up report No. 2 from Serbia, submitted 24 Jun 2016, 40 new outbreaks of lumpy skin disease (LSD) have been added to the previous 17, making a total of 57 outbreaks since the start of the epizootic there, reportedly on 4 Jun 2016. This reflects a rather speedy spread of the virus, likely to be supported by the climatic conditions, increasing the risk of further spread of this vector-borne disease within the Balkans. The total number of reported LSD outbreaks in the 4 affected Balkan countries since the start of 2016 becomes 321.

The 3 Serbian OIE reports and an interactive map showing all 57 accumulated outbreaks are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=20284. The most northern outbreak in Serbia is coming closer to the Romanian border.

Romania's decision to restrict the imports of milk and dairy products (apparently, for human consumption) from Bulgaria is in need of clarification. OIE's International animal health code specifies, in addition to live animals and their semen, the following products as liable to restrictions (certification) from countries considered infected with LSD:
1. Embryos/oocytes of cattle and water buffaloes (Article 11.11.10).
2. Products of animal origin (from cattle) intended for agricultural or industrial use (Article 11.11.11).
3. Products of animal origin (from cattle and water buffaloes) intended for agricultural or industrial use (Article 11.11.12).
4. Raw hides of cattle and water buffaloes (Article 11.11.13).

Information on the vaccination in Serbia has not been included in the recent follow-up report. According to earlier media information, the European Commission approved to Serbia 50 000 doses of the vaccine and the vaccination was expected to start on Monday, 20 Jun 2016. Serbia's cattle population (OIE 2014 figures) is 954 855 strong.

In addition to Romania, several other Balkan countries share borders with LSD-infected territories (from south to north): Albania, Kosovo (adjacent to the current Serbian epizootic), Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Hungary (see map at http://www.aridocean.com/SKU-4JPGW49-Balkans-political-map). - Mod.AS
