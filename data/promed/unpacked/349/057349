News
Two high-risk contacts were intercepted at Maboya Checkpoint in Butembo
- The 1st is a 45-year-old man from Kabasha in the health zone of Kalunguta for Butembo in North Kivu. He is vaccinated and is on his 17th day (D17) follow-up. When intercepted, he was asymptomatic and was referred to the epidemiological surveillance team for follow-up;
-The 2nd is a 10-year-old boy, son of 1st contact, also on the 17th day of follow-up and unvaccinated. On interception, he had fever at 40.1 Â° C, physical asthenia, jaundice, abdominal pain, anorexia and vomiting. He was taken to BUTEMBO's Ebola Treatment Center (ETC). This child and his father, the 1st case, have the same source case that was confirmed positive on 23 Oct 2019 in Kalunguta.

Vaccination
- Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 249 855 people have been vaccinated;

UNICEF DR Congo Ebola Situation Report 46 North Kivu, Ituri and South Kivu - Reporting Period: 14 - 27 Oct 2019

Highlights
- On 15 Oct 2019, to celebrate the Global Hand Washing Day, UNICEF Education and WASH teams and partners organized raising awareness activities on the correct handwashing habits to prevent the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). Activities reached over 20 000 students in the health zones of Butembo, Katwa, Beni, Mangina and Oicha.
- On 20 Oct 2019, a 1st EVD confirmed case was reported in Epulu health area (Mambasa health zone), not far from Kisangani, the main city of the Tchopo province (not affected by Ebola). Thus, UNICEF is reinforcing preparedness activities consequently.
- In Biakato Mines (Mandima health zone), a hotspot mining area where the EVD response teams face resistance, Risk Communication and Community Engagement activities conducted by UNICEF and its partners are being strengthened, especially those with community radio stations, youth and women associations to facilitate the response acceptance by local communities.
- Under Pillar 3 interventions, the UNICEF Education team successfully advocated for the reintegration in schools of out-of-school children in Kalunguta health zone. As a result, 4 catch-up classes are already functioning hosting more than 97 former out-of-school children. In addition, UNICEF distributed recreational kits in 107 primary schools, for more than 32 100 students.

Key epidemic numbers
3147 confirmed cases (WHO, 27 Oct 2019) [N.B. 3287 confirmed cases as of 10 Nov]

[WHO: REPORT from Government of Uganda (abridged, edited)]
https://reliefweb.int/report/uganda/uganda-declares-end-ebola-outbreak

Uganda declares end to Ebola outbreak says WHO

The Ministry of Health would like to officially declare the end of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak which occurred in Kasese District. The declaration comes after completion of 42 days of the post-EVD surveillance countdown period for the contacts of the last confirmed case, as per the World Health Organization (WHO) requirement for declaring an end to an outbreak of any Viral Haemorrhagic Fever (VHF).

On 28 Aug 2019, Uganda received an imported case of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) from the Democratic Republic of Congo in Kasese District, Uganda. The case was confirmed following laboratory tests conducted at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) who later succumbed to EVD on 30 Aug 2019 [see ProMED-mail Ebola update (84): Congo DR (NK,IT,SK) cases, Uganda, summaries, response 20190830.6649635].

Screening of travelers at all Points of Entry, active community and health facility based surveillance and risk communication continues throughout the country with emphasis on the high risk districts. However, Uganda remains on high alert for any eventualities following the ongoing EVD outbreak in DRC.

The Ministry of Health recognizes the contribution of the different development partners for their support during the outbreak; he further acknowledges the efforts and contribution of the Kasese district authorities and staff to the control of this outbreak.

[Actualite (in French, machine trans., abridged, edited)]
https://actualite.cd/2019/11/10/rdc-ebola-des-agents-de-communication-de-risque-en-greve-pour-reclamer-leur-salaire

A total of 50 agents of the response to the outbreak of Ebola in Butembo operational zone on Sat 9 Nov 2019 launched a partial strike to claim the pay of their 3 months of arrears. In a memorandum issued after an assessment meeting of their protest movement, strikers say they will observe a minimum service for 72 hours. These agents, who are unhappy with their treatment, include members of the cores of risk communication and community involvement in 12 health zones (Kyondo, Katwa, Masereka, Alimbongo, Kalunguta, Vuhovi, Kayna, Manguredjipa, Biena, Lubero, Masereka and Butembo).

"At the end of a meeting evaluating the claim of our arrears of payment of premium, having found that there is no significant advance in the claims, decree a strike with minimum service for 72 hours. Exceeding this deadline, we will move to dry strikes and other large-scale actions, "reads their statement.

They specify that during this partial strike, some services will be suspended, including meetings of the communication subcommittee, sends and shares reports, participation in sub-coordination meetings and different formations. A source coordinating the response to Butembo told News.cd that the striking agents are those who are supported by the Ministry of Health. Because "WHO and UNICEF have already paid their employees".

Contacted by Actualite.cd, Dr John Kombe, coordinator of the Ebola outbreak response in Butembo reassured that contacts are under way to find a solution. "These are people who have worked, who have helped us in this fight against Ebola, they deserve their salaries, contacts are under way, for them to be paid," said Dr. John Kombe.

Ref. Keita AK, Vidal N, Toure A, et al. A 40 months follow-up of Ebola virus disease survivors in Guinea (Postebogui) reveals longterm detection of Ebola viral RNA in semen and breast milk. Open Forum Infectious Diseases, ofz482, https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofz482

Background
With the increasing frequency and impact of Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks illustrated by recent epidemics, good knowledge on extent of viral persistence or RNA detection in body fluids from survivors is urgently needed.

Methods
Ebola viral RNA shedding was studied with molecular assays in semen (n=1368), urine (n=1875), cervico-vaginal fluid (n=549), saliva (n=900), breast milk (n=168) and feces (n=558) from EVD survivors in Guinea (POSTEBOGUI cohort, n=802) at a regular base until 40 months after inclusion.

Results
27/277 (9.8%) male survivors tested positive for Ebola RNA in at least one semen sample. The probability of remaining positive for Ebola RNA in semen was estimated at 93.02% and 60.12% after 3 and 6 months. Viral RNA in semen was more frequent in patients with eye pain (p=0.036), joint pain (p=0.047), and higher antibody levels to Ebola virus antigens (NP (p=0.001), GP (p=0.05) and VP40 (p=0.05)). Ebola RNA was only rarely detected in other body fluids from EVD survivors: saliva (1/454) urine (2/593), breast milk (2/168), cervico-vaginal secretions (0/273), feces (0/330). RNA was detected in breast milk one month after delivery but 500 days after discharge of Ebola treatment unit (ETU) in a woman who became pregnant 7 months after discharge from the ETU.

Conclusions
The frequency and potential long term presence of viral RNA in semen confirm that systematic prevention measures in male survivors are required. Our observation in breast milk suggests that our knowledge on viral reservoir in immune privileged sites and its impact is still incomplete.

[The presence of Ebola viral RNA over time in semen and occasionally in breast milk has been known, but this study added to the body of knowledge by demonstrating long term shedding of viral RNA in these tow bodily fluids, occasionally in others, but not in cervico-vaginal secretions or feces in survivors of Ebola in Guinea. Finding of persistence of RNA in semen for 6 months and breast milk for 500 days post release from treatment center is significant and points to the need for good biologic monitoring of survivors and review of recommendations following infection. It is not known whether anti-viral compounds will be effective when administered to these patients who shed virus. The one caveat is this is viral RNA only; tests for infectious virus were not done. Nonetheless, the viral RNA must have been produced by the virus, but titer may be too low to be epidemiologically insignificant. That being said, there is evidence of sexual transmission in at least one case from a survivor with evidence of viral RNA only (Diallo B, Sissoko D, Loman NJ et al. Clin Infect Dis. 2016 Nov 15;63(10):1353-1356). Experimental studies are needed. - Mod LK]

- Fri 8 Nov 2019. Vaccine
[Science Magazine (edited)]
https://scienmag.com/study-vaccine-protects-monkeys-against-four-types-of-hemorrhagic-fever-viruses/

Ref. R Cross et al. Quadrivalent VesiculoVax vaccine protects nonhuman primates from viral-induced hemorrhagic fever and death. Journal of Clinical Investigation. DOI: 10.1172/JCI131958 (2019).

Scientists funded by the National Institutes of Health have developed an investigational vaccine that protected cynomolgus macaques against 4 types of hemorrhagic fever viruses endemic to overlapping regions in Africa. The University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston and Profectus BioSciences of New York are developing and testing the candidate quadrivalent VesiculoVax vaccine, with support from NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and Redeemer's University in Nigeria.

The newly published study in the Journal of Clinical Investigation describes how the vaccine was created using a live-attenuated (weakened) vesicular stomatitis virus to deliver proteins that elicit protective immune responses. The proteins are from Ebola virus (Kikwit strain), Sudan virus (Boniface strain, which also causes Ebola virus disease), Marburg virus (Angola strain) and Lassa virus (Josiah strain). There are no licensed vaccines to provide protection from any of those viruses-all of which can cause severe disease and death-although the European Medicines Agency has recommended licensing a VSV-Ebola vaccine.

Importantly, the monkeys infected in the study were exposed to different strains of Sudan virus (Gulu) and Lassa virus (0043/LV/14) than those in the candidate vaccine to help the researchers determine whether the vaccine would be cross-protective. Lassa 0043/LV/14 is circulating in an outbreak in Nigeria that began in 2018. Previous studies indicate that the investigational Ebola virus (Kikwit) vaccine will protect against other strains of Ebola virus.

The scientists inoculated 20 macaques with a primary and booster dose of quadrivalent VesiculoVax. The animals had 5 blood draws to check for an immune response, including on the day of initial vaccination and on days 10 and 28, then on day 56 when they received a booster inoculation, and again on day 66. On day 84 scientists infected the macaques with the 4 different hemorrhagic fever viruses and monitored them to day 112.

A total of 12 additional macaques in the study who were infected with the 4 viruses but not vaccinated all became sick, but none of the vaccinated animals did. Only one of the 20 vaccinated animals had any of the 4 hemorrhagic fever viruses detectable (Lassa) following the study.

The scientists state that the addition of the Lassa virus component to their multivalent vaccine is an exciting research advance as they already had developed an investigational trivalent vaccine that provided protection against Ebola, Sudan and Marburg viruses. The researchers now plan further vaccine tests against other strains of Lassa virus, and they want to further evaluate whether a single-dose quadrivalent vaccine appears safe and effective.
