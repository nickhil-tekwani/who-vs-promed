Fruit compote may be the most likely culprit which sickened visitors
to the Russian pavilion at Folklorama this past August 2010, according
to a report published by the Winnipeg Health Region. The report
details the probable cause of the verotoxigenic _E. coli_ and its
effect on 37 people who either attended the pavilion or who fell
victim to secondary spread of the _E. coli_ [O157:H7] bacterium. Only
3 of the total 40 cases were not linked to the pavilion. In addition,
the report offers a number of recommendations designed to reduce the
risk of _E. coli_ outbreaks in the future.

According to the "VTEC Outbreak 2010 Report," each person who was
treated was interviewed to find the common connection with the
pavilion. A study was then undertaken to determine the identity of the
specific food item which was contaminated with _E. coli_, with 33 out
of 34 people who attended the pavilion taking part. 5 patients were
hospitalized with 1 case admitted to ICU and 17 people visited an
emergency room. There was 1 case of hemolytic uremic syndrome. VIP
tour group attendees who had not been ill were asked to volunteer to
be controls in the study.

The study looked at foods such as borscht, meatballs, a rice dish, and
Russian juice (fruit compote) [see comment below - Mod.LL]. These 4
items were served together on the "Russian Combination platter."
Analysis narrowed down the mostly likely choice to the compote over
other sources, partially because the compote was served with both the
vegetarian and non-vegetarian platters. The most plausible source of
contamination of the compote could have either been from
cross-contamination from raw or undercooked ground beef, which is the
most common source of _E. coli_ in food products, which was also being
handled at the same time in the kitchen, or from_ E. coli_
contaminated apples used to make the compote.

Interviews with the kitchen staff revealed that most of the food was
cooked in a pressure cooker. However, the compote was cooked in a
separate pot. It was prepared by adding washed, unpeeled apples,
blueberries, and blackberries to boiling water. The fruit was bought
fresh from a supermarket in Winnipeg.

Once boiled for 5 to 10 minutes, the compote was decanted into large
10-liter plastic pails. The boiled compote was then refrigerated until
served cold. A new batch of compote was made every day. The only other
food item that may have been cooked in the same pot was rice. The
fruit was washed before boiling, kitchen staff wore gloves and
practiced proper hand washing, and pots were washed and sanitized
between uses.

Verotoxigenic _E. coli_ is a bacterium most commonly found in the
intestines of cattle and other animals. It is most likely that the
source of _E. coli_ in this outbreak was related to handling of raw
ground beef in the kitchen, with cross-contamination of other food
products, but the investigators were unable to confirm this
hypothesis. Although Russian pavilion food handlers tried their best
to maintain high standards, it is plausible that at some time from 3
to 5 Aug 2010, cross-contamination of other foods in the kitchen,
specifically the compote, may have occurred.

Although the many _E. coli_ outbreaks have been linked to ground beef,
it is not entirely uncommon to link an outbreak to apple juice (cider)
that has not been properly pasteurized. Apples that are picked off the
ground on a farm can become contaminated with manure containing _E.
coli_, leading to the potential for the spread from eating
contaminated apples. But since the compote juice should have been
brought to a boil in its preparation at the pavilion, it should have
met the equivalent standards of pasteurization and should not have
been contaminated with _E. coli_ during the cooking phase of its
preparation.

Pavilion staff worked very hard to provide hot fresh food to all
attendees, but they were under great pressure to serve food quickly to
large numbers of people. Although kitchen staff were very diligent in
adhering to strict food handling procedures, temperature monitoring of
cooked foods was not always possible due to the extreme time
restrictions. According to pavilion staff, none of the pavilion
volunteers and performers who repeatedly consumed food and beverages,
including compote juice, reported any illness.

[The full report can be found at
<http://www.wrha.mb.ca/community/publichealth/cdc/files/VTECOutbreak_100928.pdf>. In the report, it is clearly stated that the organism was an _E. coli_
O157:H7.

Fruit compote is a cooked fruit dessert, which combines an assortment
of fruits and a rich, thick syrup. The fruit is cooked on low heat to
warm it and break it down slightly, and the result may be served warm
or chilled. - Mod.LL]
