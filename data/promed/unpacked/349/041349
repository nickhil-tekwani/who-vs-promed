The following background data on pertussis in the Russian Federation were
abstracted from GIDEON.
Routine infant vaccination (DPT) is administered at ages 3, 4 to 5, 6 and
18 months.
Year / Cases reported / Vaccine coverage percent
1991 / 30 876
1992 / 24 004 / 73
1993 / 39 218 / 79
1994 / 48 614 / 88
1995 / 20 626 / 78
1996 / 13 842 / 84
1997 / 27 279 / 88
1998 / 28 045 / 91
1999 / 22 222 / 95
2000 / 29 983 / 97

[Once again Steve Berger keeps us honest with a reminder of the
data. Thank you Steve! The reported DPT3 coverage rate of 97 percent for
2000 is impressive (DPT3 coverage rate refers to the percentage of children
less than one year of age having received 3 or more doses of DPT), but
doesn't erase the discussion of whether vaccination histories of adoptive
children should be reviewed prior to travel to their adoptive country. In
fact, this particular case highlights pockets of unvaccinated in areas that
have high overall vaccination coverages.
More information on the status of the immunization program activities in the
Russian Federation can be
found at the WHO Vaccines website:

With reference to the posting on whooping cough in a child adopted from
Russia the moderator states "This case also begs the question of whether
childhood vaccinations should be part of pre-adoptive recommendations,
especially for children coming from countries where childhood vaccination
levels are lower".
US immigration laws already require immigrant visa applicants (including
adopted children) to obtain certain vaccinations prior to the issuance of an
immigrant visa. The vaccination requirement table from one of the US
embassies (Korea) shows that DPT is required for children aged 2 months to 6
years.

The US government also has produced country specific flyers for prospective
parents of adopted children. The flyer for Russia is available @

[Checking the weblinks provided by Dr. Badrinath is very informative. The
information for adoption of Russian children provides the names of
physicians who could care for the children if ill while waiting for
adoption, including one physician who is listed as providing vaccinations.
The document from the US Embassy in Korea clearly states the immunization
requirements for adoptive children prior to getting a visa for entry in the
USA. "Panel physicians who conduct medical examinations on behalf of
immigrant visa applicants are now required to verify that immigrant visa
applicants have met the new vaccination requirement, or that it is medically
inappropriate for the visa applicant to receive one or more of the listed
vaccinations. Certain waivers of the vaccination requirement are available
upon the recommendation of the panel physician." Given the wording of this,
one wonders if the case discussed in the previous ProMED posting was a case
that was not vaccinated because of having been granted a waiver for one of
the stated acceptable reasons. - Mod. MPP]
