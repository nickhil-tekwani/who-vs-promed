Zimbabwe: Anthrax Claims Three in Goromonzi
-----------------------------------------------
Anthrax has killed three people at Juru Growth Point in Goromonzi,
Mashonaland East Province. The Department of Veterinary Services has,
meanwhile, moved in swiftly to contain the outbreak.
In an interview in Harare yesterday, the Department of Veterinary
Services' technical director, Dr Unesu Ushewokunze-Obatolu, said the
situation only came to light last Friday after the three people had
already succumbed to the disease. "The people might have been
infected through either eating or handling affected meat and the
Department of Veterinary Services has already started vaccinating all
the animals in the area," she said Dr Ushewokunze-Obatolu said a
total restriction had been placed on the movement of livestock and
meat in the area and all butcheries had been closed as an emergency
measure to prevent the spread of the disease. "We have placed the
area under quarantine until further notice. We also urge people to
report cases of animals that die of natural causes to our staff in
their respective areas and not to eat the meat," she said.
Dr Ushewokunze-Obatolu, however, expressed concern that they only had
enough vaccines to contain the current outbreak but was hopeful that
the department would be able to replenish its stocks so as to swiftly
and effectively deal with any future emergencies. She attributed the
inadequate stocks to the unavailability of foreign currency to buy
vaccines.
Dr Ushewokunze-Obatolu strongly advised people whose cattle would
have died of suspected anthrax not to skin them but burn the
carcasses and bury them deep underground.

[It seems that while the veterinary service was fighting this problem
in Mudzi district (see 20061207.3454) it was gently boiling away
in Goromonzi. It is interesting that with all the activity in Mudzi
no one bothered to report livestock deaths until they had three human
cases. Presumably it was at this point that the Public Health folk
picked up their telephones to call the cases in. One can hope that
their remaining stocks of vaccine are of better quality than was
quoted in the last report. - Mod.MHJ]
