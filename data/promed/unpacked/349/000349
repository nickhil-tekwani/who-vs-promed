[The state of Telangana is in central India; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana. And the location of Warangal can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warangal.

This outbreak in Warangal district is a fair distance from the singular 2019 outbreak in Kattangoor. The source of ovine outbreaks, in the absence of nearby affected herds or flocks, can be difficult to determine as they are delicate grazers, not ripping up soil like cattle. We must await whatever further information is available from veterinary investigations in Telangana. - Mod.MHJ
