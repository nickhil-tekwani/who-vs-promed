The Ministry of Health and Social Services, together with other stakeholders in Gobabis, have been working around the clock to come up with the regional response plan that will mitigate effects of a hepatitis E outbreak in town. Since the 1st case was reported in December 2018 -- a pregnant woman who has since miscarried -- 6 other cases have recently been confirmed out of the suspected 25, and the figure keeps rising steadily.

Most of the reported cases are coming from informal settlements with poor sanitation, especially Kanaan C, whose residents have no access to clean water and toilets, which is why the regional directorate of health has been meeting with officials from the town council, regional council, and office of the governor to see how fast they could provide these key services to the said settlement.

According to the chief medical officer for Omaheke Region, Dr Leonard Kabongo, the emergency regional management meetings held Tuesday and Wednesday, 29-30 Jan 2019, yielded favourable fruits towards the mitigation of hepatitis E in the affected areas. Kabongo said they planned to install three 10 000 L [2642 gal] clean-water tanks and 10 portable toilets yesterday afternoon [Wed 30 Jan 2019] in Kanaan C, where most of the cases originated from.

"We are probably going to purchase and install more, but we will see how the budget will allow," he said. Kabongo has also revealed that his directorate has sent health-extension workers to the affected settlements, and especially to the affected households, to conduct informative meetings.

They will also start with the distribution of water purification tablets to the affected communities. In addition, there will be a clean-up campaign on Sat 9 Feb 2019 in the said areas, and Kabongo is calling on stakeholders to come on board and assist with necessary tools and equipment as well as trucks to add to the 2 availed by town council.

Hepatitis E, a liver disease mostly associated with poor sanitation, was reported in 2018 in Windhoek and Omusati Region, respectively.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, whereas genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Acute epidemic hepatitis E is attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. Many of the deaths are in pregnant women, characteristic of genotype 1.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. - Mod.LL
