West Nile virus risk in Britain
-------------------------------
West Nile virus, which recently killed almost 300 people in America,
could soon appear in Britain because of climate change and the growth
of international travel. Sir Liam Donaldson, the Chief Medical
Officer, said that while the threat was low, the chances of an
outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease in Britain were increasing.
About 1/5 of people infected by the virus develop West Nile fever;
symptoms include headaches, rashes and swollen lymph glands. More
serious infection can lead to West Nile encephalitis or meningitis.
Contingency plans have been drawn up after evidence that the Asian
tiger mosquito (_Aedes albopictus_), which transmits the disease to
human beings from animals such as horses and birds, is now in Britain

[Press reports on similar lines appeared in most UK papers, including
provincial ones, and the potential threat of West Nile virus to
Britain was announced on the BBC. However, The Times, along with the
Observer, are among the few newspapers that said that there was
evidence that the Asian tiger mosquito (_Aedes albopictus_) was now
in Britain.
Although _Ae. albopictus_ has spread through commerce from Asia to
numerous countries including the USA, and countries in Latin America,
Africa and Europe, it has never been recorded in Britain.
Nevertheless, in August 2003 the media published reports of _Ae.
albopictus_ as occurring in Britain, based on a press release from
the UK government Health Protection Agency (HPA). When they were
challenged on this, they said this was misreporting by the Press, and
agreed that this mosquito had never been recorded in Britain.
I still know of no evidence to suggest that this mosquito has landed
in Britain.
The report also appears to suggest that if WN virus were introduced
into Britain, the main vector would be _Ae. albopictus_, when in fact
it would much more likely be spread by a number of indigenous
mosquito species.
It is of interest to note that the Health Protection Agency started
its "2004 West Nile virus surveillance scheme" on 27 May
