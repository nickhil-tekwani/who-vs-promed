Nice examples, but only one shows human data. When I worked as a state rabies control epidemiologist in the 1980's, I was told there was a significant proportion of rabies antibodies in non-vaccinated raccoon trappers near the Florida-Georgia [FL/GA] border (from which the East Coast raccoon rabies epizootic began, after FL/GA raccoons were relocated to Virginia for hunting purposes).

CDC's rabies experts, who I think mostly worked in the Fort Collins virology offices, were aware of these data, although nobody thought it would serve much purpose to publicize them. (I think everyone figured that if these data were publicized, some people might become complacent about precautions and nobody's protection would improve.)

If this, or other similar observations, can be confirmed, it would support Dr Hugh-Jones' speculation about the Nigerian dog butchers' possible subclinical exposure.

There are other encephalitis viruses with bimodal clinical spectra. Eastern encephalitis may be one of them. Some get minor or no symptoms, while others get devastating brain injury. There's not much in between, and there's no clinical warning of impending danger to any particular individual.

My personal guess is that this deadly lottery rests on a combination of age, genetic variation, number, and location of viruses injected, and acuity of exposure -- but testing these hypothesized risk factors might require more resources, for potentially ambiguous results, than anyone currently wants to spend.

A while back, I either read or was told about a fox trapper in Alaska. Anyway, the guy would use his mouth to strip the pelt off his catch and, if I recall correctly, he had a decent titer to rabies.

We also had the girl from Missouri that was in a Houston Hospital a couple of times with severe headaches, etc. that was titered without having been vaccinated. It was reported in MMWR. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm5907.pdf

[There appear to be a number of stories, documented studies and anecdotal, of humans with rabies titres but no history of vaccination. Some appear to be associated with clinically severe headaches. This is clearly a topic awaiting a doctoral dissertation. Target cohorts for bleeding and testing might include Mexican bat guano miners -- the various bat species in these caves and volcanic vents have histories of rabies -- or even Texans routinely exposed to Mexican free-tail bats, fox trappers, and family members with headaches and inapparent infected pets.

I can appreciate why such events do not get followed up as the documented existence of such individuals with positive titres might dissuade truly exposed individuals from getting treatment and post-exposure vaccination at a high human cost. I still get vaccinated every 3 years or so because of the real possibility of exposure in the field as an investigative veterinarian; my medical friends say I can stop as I probably already have a respectable titre.

Dave raises an interesting parallel point with EEE [eastern equine encephalitis]. For many years Louis MacFarland, our State Epidemiologist, and I compared notes about the human cases of EEE we had in Louisiana. Most were mild even if hospitalised; I can remember only one case with severe neurological damage but he went home eventually. This is very different from the medical textbooks and New Jersey. The logical explanation is that we in the semi-tropics have mosquito activity for some 50 out of the 52 weeks (I had to remove one from my car this morning [6 Mar 2014] and we had ice on the streets on Tuesday [4 Mar 2014]) and thus benefit from herd immunity; unfortunately our horses do not. - Mod.MHJ]
