Urban Yellow fever in Cote d'Ivoire - WHO Update 2
--------------------------------------------------
A WHO assessment team has been working with the Ministry of Health, UNICEF
and other partners to implement measures to contain the urban outbreak of
yellow fever in Abidjan. The Ministry of Health is currently carrying out
vaccination campaigns using limited national stocks in the areas of Abidjan
where cases have been identified. A mass campaign for the entire city of
Abidjan is planned to begin on Mon 17 Sep 2001. It is crucial that this
vaccination campaign take place as soon as possible to raise the level of
immunity in the city's population and so reduce the risk of spread of
yellow fever.
WHO is strengthening an international team assisting the Ministry of Health
in this urgent campaign. WHO epidemiologists, specialists in vaccination
campaigns, and an entomologist will be working to ensure the efficacy of
the campaign. In addition, partners from the Global Outbreak Alert and
Response Network will be joining the team.
WHO has launched an urgent appeal for US $2.9 million to cover the cost of
this mass campaign. To date, US $600 000 has been pledged by the French
government, European Commission, WHO, and UNICEF to cover the operational
costs of the campaign as well as vector control activities. Further funds
will be required to purchase the vaccine from an international stockpile as
soon as possible.
WHO advises travellers to Cote d'Ivoire to be aware of the risk of yellow
fever and to ensure that they are vaccinated (this is a requirement of the
International Health Regulations).
