Abstract
--------
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection of zoonotic origin is an emerging concern in industrialized countries. In the past few years, several cases of zoonotic hepatitis E have been identified and the consumption of food products derived from pork liver has been associated with clusters of human cases. More specifically, raw or undercooked pork products have been incriminated. Few data on the effect of heating on HEV inactivation in food products are available. In the present study, the various times and temperatures that are used during industrial processing of pork products were applied to experimentally contaminated food preparations. After treatment, the presence of residual infectious virus particles was investigated using real-time reverse transcription-PCR and an in vivo experimental model in pigs. Results show that heating the food to an internal temperature of 71 deg C [160 deg F] for 20 min is necessary to completely inactivate HEV. These results are very important for determining processing methods to ensure food safety in regard to foodborne hepatitis E.

[In the full text, the authors add:
"In the model used here, intravenous inoculation was chosen to ensure the detection of all infectious particles. Oral infection in pigs has been shown to be less efficient; thus, the time/temperature scale identified for HEV inactivation in this study can be considered conservative. In conclusion, the study presented here confirms that heating efficiently inactivates HEV in food products derived from infected pork liver. Such products should be consumed after they have been cooked for at least 20 min to an internal temperature of 71 deg C [160 deg F]."

The communicator, Sukie Crandall, has forwarded the abstract above with the following accompanying comment: "I got curious if cooking could have protected the ferrets in the Netherlands since many ferret owners there use raw feeding."

Sounds plausible; feeding potentially HEV-contaminated raw feed of animal origin, such as pork, to pets -- including ferrets -- may infect them and expose their human contacts to infection. Another example of the need to control the food and feed chain from farm to fork, or in this case, from farm to ferret. - Mod.AS]
