A comment on the suspected introduction of West Nile virus into Hawaii
-----------------------------------------------
In January 2004, a 2-day workshop was held in Honolulu, Hawaii to assess
the potential for the introduction of West Nile virus to the islands and
its prevention. See: <http://www.environment-hawaii.org/204experts.htm>
At this meeting, we presented results of a risk assessment of the pathways
by which the virus might be introduced. The paper was published in
Springer's new peer-reviewed journal, Ecohealth, in June 2004 (Kilpatrick,
A.M., Glutzberg, Y., Burgett, J. & Daszak, P. 2004. Quantitative risk
assessment of the pathways by which West Nile virus could reach Hawaii.
Ecohealth 1: 205-209; available as down-loadable pdf file from
<http://www.conservationmedicine.org/publicat.htm>.
This analysis clearly showed that the most significant potential route of
entry is via infected mosquitoes traveling on airplanes from the US
mainland. If confirmed, the report in ProMED-mail [West Nile virus, avian -
USA (HI): susp 20040925.2648] of suspected West Nile virus in a wild
sparrow at Kahului Airport, Hawaii suggests that the analysis was accurate
and timely. In the paper, and at the 2-day meeting, we proposed that
residual disinsection (the use of insecticides that leave a residue on
surfaces) should be mandated for the holds of all planes from regions where
West Nile virus has been confirmed, including most of the USA. If the
suspected finding of West Nile virus in Hawaii is not confirmed, or, if the
outbreak is successfully controlled, we strongly suggest that these
measures are put into place with high priority to prevent the public health
impact of West Nile virus in Hawaii, and, the potential loss of already
threatened endemic Hawaiian avian species.
