PLAGUE - USA (04): (NEW MEXICO) SEPTICEMIC, FATAL, COMMENT

ProMED has had 2 recent posts regarding plague, including China Plague - China (03): (NM) 20200809.7660510 and Plague - USA (03): (NM) septicemic, fatal 20200808.7658204. In each case, ProMED has used boilerplate language from moderator LL describing bubonic plague, which incorrectly implies that septicemic plague is a complication of bubonic plague. Septicemic plague, which refers to sepsis without presence of a bubo, is the 2nd most common presentation of plague. These recent ProMED posts are misleading and miss important teaching points, including the clinical presentation of plague syndromes other than bubonic plague and the need for empiric coverage for plague in persons with sepsis without buboes in areas where plague is in the differential diagnosis.

[ProMED thanks Gregory Mertz for his comments. My comments were not meant to imply that all cases of septicemic plague occur following the bubonic form as this is not the case. The ProMED comments are not meant to be comprehensive, but we would invite Dr. Mertz to provide further commentary on septicemic plague, "intestinal" plague and the clear need for empiric coverage for potential _Yersinia pestis_ septicemic infection in endemic areas. - Mod.LL]
