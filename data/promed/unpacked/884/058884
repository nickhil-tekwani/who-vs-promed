According to the regional Rospotrebnadzor [Federal service for
consumer protection and human welfare], 16 439 people have reported
tick bites as of 17 Jun 2011, which is a considerable increase over
the figure of 11 547 tick bites reported during the same period of the
preceding year [2010]. A total of 3861 (23.4 percent) of the cases of
tick bite involved children under the age of 14 years.

In all, 379 people have been hospitalized with suspected tick-borne
encephalitis (TBE), a figure that includes 35 children under 14 years
of age. In 49 cases, the diagnosis of TBE has been confirmed by
laboratory analysis.

In addition, there were 63 confirmed diagnoses of tick-borne
borreliosis (Lyme disease).

During the 1st 6 months of 2011, there have been 3 fatalities as a
consequence of TBE. None of them had been immunized against TBE virus
infection. One of the TBE cases received emergency prophylaxis with
TBE virus immunoglobulin, but the patient did not survive. All 3 fatal
cases were residents of Novosibirsk city. Only one of them actually
recalled having been bitten by a tick.

[Tick-borne encephalitis, unlike tick-borne boreliosis, is now a
vaccine-preventable disease. Interested readers are referred to the
ProMED-mail post: "Tick-borne encephalitis - Sweden (02): background 20100621.2078," which contains data compiled from GIDEON (Global
Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network
http://www.gideononline.com/) indicating that the incidence of TBE
in Russia has declined markedly since the beginning of the 21st
century.
