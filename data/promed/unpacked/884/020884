According to Bulgaria's media, a total of 3 outbreaks of ASF, affecting domestic pigs, have been recorded in Bulgaria since 18 Aug 2021, of which 2 are located in the Pazardzhik (Pazardjik) region (No 11 in the map) and one in the bordering Plovdiv region (No 14; map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Bulgaria).

ASF has been circulating in Bulgaria since Sept 2018, affecting both wild boar and domestic pigs. The current events seem to be the first reported outbreaks in domestic pigs during 2021.

Bulgaria's most recent report to EU's PAFF (plants, animals, food, feed) "Animal Health and Welfare Committee" (SCoPAFF), addressing its ASF situation, was presented on 23 Apr 2021 (https://ec.europa.eu/food/system/files/2021-04/reg-com_ahw_20210423_pres_asf_bgr.pdf).

According to the map presenting results of surveillance in wild boar (slide 9), ASF-positive animals were recorded in the Plovdiv province during the said period. - Mod.AS
