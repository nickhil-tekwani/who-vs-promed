Eastern Equine Encephalitis in Lake County
------------------------------------------
The Lake County, Florida, Health Department has received confirmation
that a total of 6 horses have tested positive for Eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE), a mosquito-borne disease.

No human cases of any mosquito borne illnesses have been reported in
Lake County; however, the risk of transmission to humans is possible.
This virus can cause mild to severe symptoms in humans including a
serious brain infection. Horse owners can help reduce illnesses [in
their horses] by talking with their veterinarian to make sure their
horses are vaccinated.

The Lake County Health Department reminds residents and visitors to
avoid being bitten by mosquitoes that may cause encephalitis disease.
"Lake County Mosquito Control and the health department continue
surveillance and prevention efforts and encourage everyone to take
basic precautions to help limit exposure by following the department
of health recommendations," states Environmental Health Director, Russ Melling.

To protect yourself from mosquitoes, you should remember to practice
the "5 D's":

-- Dusk and Dawn - Avoid being outdoors when mosquitoes are seeking blood.
-- Dress - Wear clothing that covers most of your skin.
-- DEET - When the potential exists for exposure to mosquitoes,
repellents containing up to 30 percent DEET
(N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) are recommended.

Other effective mosquito repellents include picaridin, oil of lemon
eucalyptus, and IR3535. Always read label directions carefully for
the approved usage before you apply a repellent. Some repellents are
not suitable for children. [They may not be suitable for your pets
either. - Mod.TG]

-- Drainage - Check around your home to rid the area of standing
water, where mosquitoes lay eggs.

Elimination of breeding sites is one of the keys to prevention. Tips
on eliminating mosquito-breeding sites include the following:

-- Clean out eaves, troughs and gutters.
-- Remove old tires or drill holes in those used in playgrounds to drain.
-- Turn over or remove empty plastic pots.
-- Pick up all beverage containers and cups.
-- Check tarps on boats or other equipment that may collect water.
-- Pump out bilges on boats.
-- Replace water in birdbaths and pet or other animal feeding dishes
at least once a week.
-- Change water in plant trays, including hanging plants, at least once a week.
-- Remove vegetation or obstructions in drainage ditches that prevent
the flow of water.

The Department of Health (DOH) continues to conduct statewide
surveillance for mosquito borne illnesses, including West Nile virus
infections, Eastern equine encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis,
malaria, and dengue. Residents of Florida are encouraged to report
dead birds via the Web site. For more information on mosquito-borne
illnesses, visit DOH's Environmental Health Web site or call your
local county health department.

Another Horse Dies Of EEE
-------------------------
A 2nd horse diagnosed with Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) has been
euthanized, the state Department of Public Health (DPH) of
Massachusetts announced Wednesday [4 Aug 2010]. The EEE infection was
confirmed Wednesday in a Warren horse that developed signs Saturday
[31 Jul 2010]. The horse was euthanized Sunday, the DPH said. State
epidemiologist Dr. Alfred DeMaria said the horse had not been
vaccinated and lived next to a swampy area.

The most recent case of EEE infection in a horse in Worcester County
occurred in 2003 in Brimfield, according to the DPH. A horse in
Middleboro was put down after being diagnosed with the disease on 21 July 2010.

There was one human case of EEE in the state in 2008, and 13 cases
with 6 deaths from 2004 through 2006, according to the DPH. The
disease is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito.

Health officials said people should take precautions to prevent
becoming infected, including being aware of peak mosquito hours from
dusk to dawn, reducing activities during those hours and applying
insect repellents outdoors.

[It continues to astound me, how in an age of constant news flow,
social networking, electronic media, print media and instant
communication that equine owners can neglect to vaccinate their
horses. Surely they have heard year after year, to vaccinate their
horses against West Nile virus and Eastern equine encephalitis and
others. These diseases are carried by mosquitoes, and many of the
mosquito borne viruses can be protected against by a combination vaccination.

If the horse has never been vaccinated, or you live in a particularly
warm environment, along the coast for example, where mosquito season
may be longer, then you may need to vaccinate the animals several
times during the year. The cost of a vaccine can save a life. - Mod.TG]
