The Salta province Director of Epidemiology, Alberto Gentile, this morning [7 Apr 2015] confirmed that a young man died in Oran department, as a result of an infection with [a] hantavirus.

The young man died in Oran but he was a resident of Hipolito Yrigoyen. There are another 5 suspected cases of infection with the same pathology.

The specialist explained that the climate conditions are a key factor in the development and propagation of the disease; equally important is the cleanliness that the families maintain in their homes with the elements used for cooking.

Gentile stated that the hantaviruses are transmitted to humans by 2 rodents, which is why it is extremely important to maintain a maximum level of personal hygiene and well as with the elements that are handled outside of the home.

The disease [virus] is transmitted from animals to humans via saliva, fecal material, and urine. Everything that is handled manually must be correctly disinfected, especially in Salta's Chaco area.

[It would be of interest to know the species of the 2 rodents mentioned above and the specific hantavirus involved in this situation. The hantavirus involved in this case and the other 5 suspected cases is not identified, and ProMED-mail would be interested in knowing whether a specific virus is laboratory identified.

Cases of hantavirus infections were reported from various parts of Argentina over the past 4 years (2012, 2013, 2014, and now 2015). As noted in ProMED-mail archive no 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, but this case in the Oran area in Salta province may have been caused by Oran hantavirus infection.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _O. longicaudatus_, is available at http://www.hantavirus.cl/educacion_prevencion/galeria_reservorio.htm.
