Abstract
--------
Introduction - The introduction of _Aedes albopictus_ in southern
France may initiate a chain of transmission of arboviruses, including
dengue and chikungunya viruses. Surveillance of imported cases in
metropolitan France by a network of laboratories is conducted since
2006. This article presents the results for the period 2008-2009.

Methods - A case of dengue or chikungunya is defined by IgM serology
or RT-PCR positivity in a patient tested in metropolitan France. 5
reference laboratories participated in the network and transmitted
their data.

Results - 693 dengue and 86 chikungunya cases were diagnosed in
2008-2009, with important monthly fluctuations. Cases occurred
predominantly in the Paris and southeastern areas. During the period
of vector activity (May-November) and in the places where it is
located, the number of dengue cases diagnosed in 2008 and 2009 was
respectively 11 and 15 and the number of chikungunya cases,
respectively 7 and 0.

Conclusion - The introduction of dengue and chikungunya viruses from
travelers returning from endemic areas is a real risk in southeastern
France. The laboratory surveillance is one of the tools to support the
national antiarboviruses program.

[The chikungunya virus outbreak in Italy in 2007 was transmitted by
_Ae. albopictus_ (see ProMED archive no. 20071210.3980). The spread of
this vector mosquito in the Mediterranean Basin, including southern
France and the frequent introduction of chikungunya and dengue viruses
presents a real risk of ongoing transmission as occurred in Italy. The
surveillance system that is operating in France should provide early
warning of any locally acquired cases.

including maps from the European Center for Disease Control, can be
