The potentially fatal botulism disease is affecting waterbirds at Alice
Springs. Wildcare chairman Petra Squires said almost 50 birds were known to
have been stricken by the disease. 37 are known to have died.
She said birds contracted the disease, which results in them slowly
becoming paralyzed, after eating from the water in the Ilparpa sewage
ponds. Birds are at risk of not only drowning as a result of the disease
but of being eaten alive by crows or kites because they cannot defend
themselves.
So far, 13 live birds suffering from botulism have been found and, although
7 subsequently died, 1 has recovered and was released back into the wild.
At the weekend, Mrs. Squires found 30 dead birds, saw dozens of sick ones
on the water and 2 that had been attacked in the head.
She said: "When the water becomes hotter at this time of year the bacteria
in the muck increase. The birds feeding from the water ingest the bacteria
and subsequently poison gets into their systems and they become
immobilized. They can drown or will die from starvation and dehydration
within a couple of days if they are not rescued. It is a painfully slow
death that we want to prevent. All the birds handed in so far have been
found in the sewage ponds area."
Mrs. Squires called on people, especially birdwatchers going to the area to
be on the lookout for sick birds and to hand them in to the Reptile Centre
or contact Wildcare on 0419 221 128 so they can be saved and rehabilitated.
