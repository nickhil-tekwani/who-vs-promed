A 35-year-old woman with bird flu symptoms from an Indonesian village
which has seen a number of confirmed or suspected cases of the
disease in humans has died, a hospital official said on Fri 18 Aug
2006. But a government official denied that the cases in the West
Javan village of Cikelet, described by officials as rife with H5N1
virus, pointed to a possible new cluster case.

"Last night a patient was referred by a doctor in Garut with symptoms
of suspected avian influenza such as breathlessness and high
temperature, so we isolated her and planned to send her to Bandung
hospital," said Yogie Prayogi, spokesman at Dr Slamet Hospital. "But
she died before we could bring her." He said that blood samples had
been sent for testing.
A 9-year-old girl from Cikelet died of bird flu this week according
to 2 local tests, taking Indonesia's confirmed toll from the disease
to 45, the highest of any country.
A 17-year-old youth from the remote village, actually a number of
hamlets, about 90 km south of Bandung, has also tested positive for
H5N1, but he has stayed at home after refusing to be hospitalised.
Another man also died this month with bird flu-like symptoms.

Hasan Sadikin hospital in the West Java capital of Bandung is now
treating 3 suspected bird flu patients, after another villager of
Cikelet in Garut regency was admitted to the hospital late Friday [18
Aug 2006]. Wednesday and Thursday 2 patients also from Cikelet
village were admitted to the hospital.
"This latest patient, who is in the 14th week of pregnancy, was
admitted to the hospital at 7:30 p.m on Friday," hospital president
director Hadi Yusuf was quoted by the Antara news agency as saying on
Saturday [19 Aug 2006]. He said that the house of the latest patient
was close to another bird flu patient who had died recently.
A woman died on Thursday night [17 Aug 2006] -- 3 hours after being
admitted to a hospital in Garut. The hospital is awaiting laboratory
test results to see if she had contracted the virus.
Cikelet is a village some 150 kilometers southeast of Jakarta where
at least one person has died of the disease and another sickened.
Four other people died before tests could be taken to see if they had
bird flu. The H5N1 virus has killed at least 140 people worldwide
since it began ravaging Asian poultry stocks in late 2003 -- 46 in
Indonesia, the world's worst affected country, according to the World
Health Organization.

[The cluster of cases in the village of Cikelet, which appears to
consist of a group of several smaller hamlets, is still under
investigation. Unfortunately it appears that diagnostic materials are
not available from all the suspected cases. Only 2 from a total of at
least 7 patients with bird flu symptoms have been confirmed as cases
of H5N1 avian influenza. The reason for this cluster of cases remains
to be established; possibilities are infection from a common source
(infected poultry), susceptibility of members of an extended family,
or an increase in virulence of the virus. The latter is the least
likely explanation, and changes in virulence for humans have not been
observed elsewhere up to the present.

Health officials say changes caused by the drug oseltamivir might be
the reason why tests on 2 recent cases were negative initially. The
H5N1 avian influenza virus has become more complex, probably as a
result of the antiviral drug oseltamivir, and that has caused
complications in detecting it in the laboratory, the Public Health
Ministry said yesterday [Thu 17 Aug 2006].
Dr Paijit Warachit, director-general of the Department of Medical
Sciences, said there had been laboratory failures in detecting the
[H5N1] virus during the first tests of the 2 most recent cases of
bird flu in 2006. "It's been more difficult to test [the virus] this
year," he said. Both cases were confirmed as H5N1 in a subsequent test.
"It may be because the progress of the disease [in humans] has become
more complicated," Paijit said. One factor could be the effect of
oseltamivir, or tamiflu, which is believed to be the only effective
defence against bird flu in humans. The drug, Paijit said, was only
able to prevent the virus from replicating and did not destroy it.
That meant little of the virus was excreted into that part of the
respiratory tract where specimens are taken for testing. "[Medical
staff] took swabs in that area, yet as it turned out there was not
enough of the virus to enable them to detect it," he said. "The virus
was deeper in the respiratory passage."
Since 2004 when bird flu emerged in Thailand, the ministry has tested
more than 4000 people for the virus and the failure rate due to
[incorrect specimen collection] had been only 3 per cent, he said.
But that figure had risen to 20 per cent in 2006, Paijit said. "We
need to continue our studies to see whether the virus will become
more and more difficult [to detect] in the future," he said.
In response to findings by Chulalongkorn University scientists that a
new form [i.e. strain] of the virus had been detected in Nakhon
Phanom, Paijit said this strain had yet to infect humans. The virus
was found in poultry and it would probably be more virulent than the
old one, he said.
Meanwhile, caretaker Public Health Minister Pinij Charusombat
yesterday called a meeting with about 500 private hospitals and
clinics to seek their cooperation on bird-flu surveillance and
reporting of patients suspected of having bird flu. "It's a concern
that some private hospitals may be failing to report a suspected case
for fear it could scare their patients," Pinij said. Any health
facility that failed to report a case would face harsh punishment.
The Public Health Ministry had also joined with the Bangkok
Metropolitan Administration and the Drug Stores Club of Thailand in
stepping up screening of patients with suspected bird-flu symptoms.
Bangkok Governor Apirak Kosayodhin said he had ordered poultry checks
to be increased and had set a limit on the movement of poultry into
Bangkok in order to prevent avian flu being spread in the capital.
