Of 300 infants tested for tuberculosis [TB] on Friday and Saturday [26
and 27 Aug 2011], tests were reported positive in a further 18 infants
today. Overall to date of the 917 infants seen, the tests results were
available for 729 infants, and 52 (7.13 per cent) were positive. Of
the 18 new positive cases, 11 were male and 7 female. 5 of the 18
positive children were born in February, 2 in March, 2 in April, 3 in
May, 5 in June, and one in July.

A positive test for TB does not mean that TB disease developed, but
[indicates that TB infection has occurred following exposure to the
organism that causes TB]. Under the plan prepared by the Regional
Coordination Unit, therapy according to international guidelines will
be instituted for positive infants to prevent their developing TB
disease in the future following their exposure to _Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_.

The Coordination Unit points out that none of the infants who tested
positive have developed illness consistent with TB disease to date. As
of today, Tue 30 Aug 2011, 155 infants were scheduled for further
testing, and it is anticipated that by 31 Aug 2011 all the exposed
infants will have been tested as required by the plan prepared by the
Regional Coordination Unit.

[The above news release concerns an outbreak of latent tuberculosis
(TB) infection among infants born at Rome's Gemelli Hospital between
March and July 2011 after exposure to a nurse with TB who worked at
Gemelli's neonatal ward (See ProMED-mail post Tuberculosis, latent,
nosocomial, infants - Italy: (Rome) 20110825.2587). Although not
stated in the news releases, presumably the nurse has active, most
likely cavitary, TB in order to have infected multiple neonatal
contacts. Children under 5 years of age with latent TB infection are
at high risk for progressing to primary TB and its sequelae,
disseminated TB and TB meningitis. Therefore, Italian authorities
instituted a plan for all the exposed infants to be evaluated for
tuberculosis promptly and if infected given antimicrobial therapy.

The infants were screened by means of a blood test that measures the
release of interferon-gamma from the infant's lymphocytes after a
sample of their blood has been incubated overnight with proteins
specific for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. Results can be available
within 24 hours and are not affected by prior BCG (bacillus
Calmette-Guerin) vaccination.

Polyclinic is a large general hospital of 1850 beds in Rome. It serves
as the teaching hospital for the medical school of the Universita
Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (the largest privately owned university in
Italy)(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agostino_Gemelli_University_Polyclinic).
