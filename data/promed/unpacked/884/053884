Whooping cough cases double in Northern Territory
-------------------------------------------------
There has been a spike in whooping cough (pertussis) cases in the Top End, prompting the Northern Territory's Department of Health to extend its alert. Official figures show infection rates for the potentially fatal disease doubled since 2015, with 165 cases confirmed in the state since January 2016. Almost 90 percent of those infected have been in the Palmerston and Darwin areas.

Dr Rosalind Webby from the NT Centre for Disease Control said while the rise was not connected to a drop in immunization rates, Territorians were being urged to ensure their vaccinations were up-to-date. "There hasn't been any decrease in immunization rates, we still have high immunization coverage in the Territory, and we know that's good, but we want to make sure people get it on time," she said. "But particularly because this is a new program, to make sure that pregnant women know that they can get a vaccine in their 3rd trimester."

The last serious whooping cough outbreak occurred in the NT during 2011, with 383 cases confirmed that year.

Dr Webby said while whooping cough presented a serious risk to young children, free vaccinations available for parents, babies and carers were helping to reduce its impact. "We're very lucky, we haven't yet had any infant deaths from whooping cough, but we want to keep it that way, that's why we are raising awareness, we want to make sure little ones really do not get sick," she said. "We worry particularly for the little children under 1 year of age, they are the ones that can get very unwell with whooping cough." She said the lack of cases so far in infants aged under one was evidence the program was working, and pregnant women could be vaccinated during their 3rd trimester.

"This can protect not only themselves, but also their baby," Dr Webby said.

[The increase in pertussis cases in many areas around the world is no doubt multifactorial, relating to the up and down nature of pertussis over the years, the waning immunity of the currently used acellular vaccine, the selection of _Bordetella pertussis_ strains less protected by the current vaccine, and the presence of non-vaccinated children. - Mod.LL
