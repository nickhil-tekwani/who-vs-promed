As of [Tue 8 Aug 2017], there have been a total of:
1693 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
683 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.5 per cent],
988 recoveries, and
22 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

Since the last ProMED-mail update [Mon 7 Aug 2017], there have been a total of:
7 newly confirmed cases
0 newly reported fatalities, and
0 newly reported recoveries.

Information on newly reported cases (7 cases):

From Dawmat Aljandal [Al Jawf region] (5 cases)
1- A 49-year-old expat male, healthcare worker noted to be in stable condition having been identified as an asymptomatic contact. Classified as a secondary healthcare acquired case in a healthcare worker.

2- A 27-year-old expat female, healthcare worker noted to be in stable condition having been identified as an asymptomatic contact. Classified as a secondary healthcare acquired case in a healthcare worker.

3- A 26-year-old expat female, healthcare worker noted to be in stable condition having been identified as an asymptomatic contact. Classified as a secondary healthcare acquired case in a healthcare worker.

4- A 21-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker noted to be in critical condition. Classified as a secondary case in a household contact.

5- A 70-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker noted to be in critical condition. Classified as a secondary healthcare acquired case in a patient.

From other regions:
6- A 58-year-old expat male, non-healthcare worker from Khamis Mushayet [Asir region], noted to be in critical condition. Classified as a primary case with high risk exposure history still under investigation.

7- A 55-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Al Ula [Al Madinah region], noted to be in stable condition. Classified as a primary case with high risk exposure history still under investigation.

[In the past 24 hours there have been an additional 7 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported in Saudi Arabia of whom 5 are associated with transmission associated contact with a previously confirmed case (cases) in Dawmat Aljandal (Al Jawf region) -- 3 asymptomatic infections in healthcare workers, and 2 individuals in critical condition -- one a patient presumably in the affected healthcare facility, and the other a household contact. Thus, there are now 9 MERS-CoV infections confirmed in Dawmat Aljandal since 2 Aug 2017 -- the index case reported on 2 Aug 2017, 4 asymptomatic healthcare workers, 3 household contacts (1 asymptomatic, 2 symptomatic), and 1 patient.

The other 2 newly confirmed cases fit the profile of many of the sporadic cases reported in Saudi Arabia with high risk exposure histories still under investigation (ergo not readily available at the time of confirmation).

A map of Saudi Arabia showing the locations of these 7 newly confirmed cases can be found at the source URL above.
