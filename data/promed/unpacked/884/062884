The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) [Taiwan] is expected to make an
announcement early in September 2007 whether a suspected case of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) reported in Tainan, southern Taiwan
is indeed the human [variant] of mad cow disease.
The CDC [Taiwan] said it needs further tests to determine if the
patient, reported by the National Chengkung University (NCKU)
Hospital, has contracted CJD [Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease], or mad cow
disease, CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Chih-hao siad.
"There has never been a case of contracting mad cow disease from
taking [bovine] placenta shots. Taiwan allows placenta only in
cosmetic products, not in shots. So if the patient took placenta
shots, the shots were illegal," Chou said.
The United Daily News, however, reported Thu 30 Aug 2007 that the
same patient, who has developed classic symptoms of CJD over the past
10 months and is currently in a vegetative state, could be suffering
from a new variant of CJD, as she had received [bovine] placenta
injections for a long time before seeking treatment at NCKU Hospital.
The CDC[Taiwan] decided to call in its specialists on 8 Sep 2007,
saying that it had received limited information about the patient's
medical history before and would like to re-examine the case, after
the NCKU hospital provides it with more details of the patient. To
date, a total of 175 classic CJD cases have been reported in Taiwan,
with about a dozen cases being reported each year, according to Chou.
Variant CJD, however, is a human disease of the central nervous
system that was first diagnosed in the United Kingdom in 1995.
Scientists have linked the disease to eating meat products from
cattle infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly
called mad cow disease. Except for a few cases in other European
nations with BSE, nvCJD has been found almost exclusively in the UK.
It strikes younger people, often begins with psychiatric symptoms and
progresses slowly.

Taiwan health authorities said on Thursday [30 Aug 2007] that they
are investigating a suspected human case of mad cow disease
contracted from taking injections of bovine placenta. "There has
never been a case of contracting mad cow disease from taking placenta
shots. Taiwan allows placenta only in cosmetic products, not in
shots. So if the patient took placenta shots, the shots were
illegal," CDC [Taiwan] Deputy Director Chou Chih-hao told reporters.
According to the hospital, a patient developed signs of mad cow
disease 10 months ago and has now lost all physical functions except
the eyes. The hospital, at the order of CDC [Taiwan], has refused to
release other information about the patient including gender.
Taiwan press quoted the patient's family members as saying that the
patient had never gone abroad and never liked to eat the innards of
animals, but had been taking bovine placenta shots for a long time to
look young. Despite Taiwan's ban on placenta shots, many Taiwanese
get the expensive shots from private clinics or go on "placenta
tours" to receive the shots in Japan. They believe that taking
placenta shots on a regular basis can improve health and preserve youth.

[If this case is caused by a prion, the relative short length of time
of progression of illness in the case described is more consistent
with classical CJD as mentioned in the posting. No confirmatory
information, clinical or otherwise, is given to confirm the diagnosis
of any prion disease at all.
Vertical transmission of spongiform encephalopathy seems to occur
with scrapie in sheep but whether it occurs in bovine disease or in
chronic wasting disease in mule deer, as far as is known, remains unclear.
An educated guess, which over the years that scientists have studied
spongiform encephalopathies may be far from the truth, would suggest
that the case may be a prion-related disease but probably not CJD
(new var.) and not related to the placental injections. - Mod.LL]
