ProMED-mail anniversary award 2012 for excellence in outbreak reporting on the internet
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Each year, ProMED-mail presents an award in honor of the anniversary of its founding in August 1994. This year, on our 18th birthday, we are pleased to announce that the 2012 ProMED-mail Award for Excellence in Outbreak Reporting on the Internet goes to one of our own, Luiz Jacintho da Silva MD, ProMED-PORT Moderator (Mod.LJS).

Luiz Jacintho da Silva MD was Full Professor of Transmissible Diseases in the Department of Clinical Medicine of the Faculty of Medical Sciences, Unicamp (University of Campinas), Sao Paulo, Brazil until 2011. He joined ProMED-mail in 1997 as the 1st moderator of the new ProMED Portuguese language list, focusing on outbreak news from Brazil, Portugal, and the Portuguese-speaking countries of Africa. This was ProMED's 1st regional network and 1st service in a non-English language.

In the 16 years since then, he posted single-handedly more than 7000 outbreak reports, most of them with his expert commentary -- far more than any other member of the ProMED team. He continued that level of productivity through changing responsibilities as chief of infectious diseases and later chief of all diseases for the state of Sao Paulo, and postings abroad as a member of the staff of the pharmaceutical giant Novartis. Since 2011 he has served as the Director of the Dengue Vaccine Initiative at the International Vaccine Institute, Seoul, South Korea.

His expertise and dedication to ProMED's mission cannot be praised too highly, and ProMED is proud to present its Anniversary Award to him.
