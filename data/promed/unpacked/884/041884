A small outbreak in Canterbury of a potentially fatal illness has authorities on the look out. There have been 7 reported cases of legionellosis between Christchurch and Selwyn.

Most of the patients had been spending time in the garden and it's believed they caught the illness from potting mix. Medical Officer of Health, Dr Alistair Humphrey, says while these cases aren't thought to be linked... more people may get hit over the next few months. "We always get people presenting over the summer, that's when people get out in their gardens. I would expect there to be some more over the summer period, though I hope there aren't too many more."

Alister Humphrey says the disease is a type of pneumonia [legionnaires' disease] and comes with a shortness of breath, coughing, and fevers.

[For a discussion of legionnaires' disease and, in particular, the association of legionellosis in New Zealand and Australia with _L. longbeachae_ and use of potting soil, see moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - New Zealand: (CA) potting soil, alert 20110116.0189.

Non-sterilized potting soil apparently contains a mixture of bacteria and free-living amoebae and elevated storage temperatures may foster the intra-amoebic growth of _L. longbeachae_ in the potting soil (Ross IS, Mee BJ, Riley TV: _Legionella longbeachae_ in Western Australian potting mix. Med J Aust 1997; 166(7): 387).

The Canterbury region of New Zealand is located on the South Island; its main city is Christchurch. For a map of this region see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_Region. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of New Zealand can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/2D26. - Mod.ML]
