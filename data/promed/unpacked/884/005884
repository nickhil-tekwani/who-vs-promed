Health inspectors suspect fruit platter behind parasite
---------------------------------------------------
The prime suspect in the parasite outbreak that sickened 94 people after an
insurance convention at a famed Palm Beach hotel this May is a fresh fruit
platter. The platter served during the American General Life Brokerage
Group's convention May 10-16 [1999 at The Breakers was made up of
pineapples, honeydew melons, cantaloupe, strawberries, blueberries,
blackberries and raspberries, according to Dr. Jean Malecki, director of
the Palm Beach County Health Department.
With so much time elapsed since the outbreak, though, investigators do not
have evidence to single out just which of the fruit in the platter carried
the Cyclospora parasite that caused the outbreak, Malecki acknowledged.
Symptoms caused by the parasite include sporadic diarrhea, nausea, cramping
and fatigue.
Palm Beach County, Florida and federal health workers have interviewed most
of the 274 people from 28 states who attended the American General Life
convention at The Breakers hotel.
Unfortunately, investigators have come up against conventioneers' fading
memories of the meals served, and the fact that none of the fruit served
then is left over.
"There's not going to be a conclusion made," Malecki said Thursday. "We
cannot say conclusively this outbreak is related to X farm and X area."
Malecki said there's no way hotel staff could tell if the parasite is
present. No test yet exists to detect the Cyclospora parasite. "You can't
taste it, you can't smell it, you can't see it ...," she explained.
"There's no way for them to know they have tainted produce."

[Concerning the outbreak in Florida at a convention held at the exclusive
Breakers hotel in Palm Beach. Of 224 people from 27 states interviewed, 44
percent reported
symptoms.
Baby lettuce and berries are suspected. The supplier of fruits to the Palm
Beach hotel said that 90% of the produce supplied came from California, but
admitted that some raspberries and blackberries might have come from
Guatemala.
