More than 400 people affected by leishmaniasis in Pandiali tehsil [administrative division] of Mohmand tribal district [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa] have been hospitalised. Local people told media persons here on Tuesday [22 Jan 2019] that the affected areas included Danish Kool, Darra, Garai and Ismail Sher Kallay in Pandiali tehsil, in addition to some localities of Haleemzai tehsil.

[G.S.], a resident, said that his daughter was among the more than 400 affected people. [Z.R.], whose son is also suffering from the disease, said that the people had shifted their children to hospitals in Peshawar and Charsadda districts because treatment of leishmaniasis was not available in Mohmand hospitals. "We are paying up to PKR 1000 [USD 7.18] per vaccine and PKR 2000 to 3000 [USD 14.37 to 21.55] as taxi charges, which is not affordable for a poor tribesman," [Z.R.] said. He said that most of the affected people were suffering from the disease for the past 2 months, but the health department did not send its teams to the area.

When contacted, District Health Officer Dr. Alamgir Khan said that leishmaniasis was a skin disease caused by a sandfly present in hilly areas and usually breeding in fresh water. He said that vaccines for treatment of leishmaniasis were not available in the country. He said that the health department had forwarded a request to WHO officials for provision of the vaccines. The residents have demanded the chief minister to order provision of treatment facilities to patients in the area.

In Karak, local officials told Director General of Health Services, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Dr. Arshad Khan on Tuesday [22 Jan 2019] that the district health department had been facing difficulties coping with the spread of leishmaniasis and other diseases because of a shortage of doctors and facilities in the local hospitals. Earlier, the Director General of Health Services, District Nazim [governor] Umer Daraz, MPA Nisar Gul, and Deputy Commissioner Mian Abidullah visited the areas affected by the disease, including Bahadarkhel and Nari Panos, and got information about the latest situation.

In response to the complaints, the Director General of Health Services assured participants of the meeting that the deficiency of staff and equipment in hospitals would be corrected. All hospitals of the province have been facing a shortage of doctors, Dr. Arshad Khan said, adding that a new policy was afoot to overcome the deficiency of doctors.

He said that the provincial government was going to empower the district health officers in the new policy both in administrative and financial matters, and they would be able to hire doctors at the local level through a committee to eliminate the deficiency of doctors. He said that leishmaniasis was also found in other parts of the province and that there was a need to adopt precautionary measures to control the disease.

[Cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic in Pakistan, especially in the tribal areas of the northwest, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. There are no vaccines against leishmaniasis as alluded to in the text. The _Leishmania_ protozoan parasite is transmitted from an animal reservoir, usually small rodents, to humans by the sandfly. Control of the infection is dependent on vector control, spraying the sandfly habitats and controlling the rodent population. - Mod.EP
