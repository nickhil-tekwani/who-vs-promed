Seafood suspected in 2 cases of cholera
---------------------------------------
2 cases of cholera believed related to eating seafood were reported to the
state Health Department in Apr and May 2005. The disease is rare in Hawaii,
with only 1 case reported in 2004.
With 2 occurring in 2 months, physicians were alerted, but no new cases
were reported, Dr. Sarah Park, deputy chief of the Disease Control and
Outbreak Division, said yesterday, 14 Jun 2005.
She said the cases involved an older woman and a young male. The woman was
seen in an emergency room, given antibiotics and fluids and was fine, Park
said. The young man also recovered after seeing a physician and taking some
medications.
The cases were unrelated except that both had eaten at different seafood
restaurants in a chain, Park said. Health inspectors checked out the
restaurants but weren't able to identify a common source of the disease,
she said.
Cholera is, Park said, an acute diarrheal illness caused by an infection of
the intestine with the _Vibrio cholerae_ bacterium. It isn't contagious,
but contracted through contaminated water or food, particularly shellfish.
Oysters, scallops and shrimp are good breeders for the bacterium, Park said.
Characteristic symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting and leg cramps.
Complications arise from dehydration, but most people in the industrialized
world do not have severe symptoms, Park said. She said the best way to
prevent cholera is to make sure food is well-cooked.
"If you're going to have the raw stuff, go to places where you know it's
prepared when you order it. But it's not 100 percent safe as eating
well-cooked food."
The freezing process doesn't kill _Vibrio cholerae_, she said. "It is
possible to have minuscule amounts in raw seafood. If it's served fresh, it
may not have enough to cause the disease. But if it sits out, like any
meat, bacteria will start to grow and multiply."

[ProMED would appreciate more information about these 2 cases, particularly
where the infections were acquired, although it sounds like the cases were
not imported, and the serotypes involved. To this point, the cases have
not been reported on the WHO Weekly Epidemiological Report. - Mod. LL]
