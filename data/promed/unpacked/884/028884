With respect to the case of pneumonia developing after a cruise to Alaska,
Legionnaire's disease is one of a number of possibilities. However it is
unlikely any blood test (presumably acute phase antibody titer) will be
diagnostic during the acute phase of illness. I would suggest a
_Legionella_ urine antigen test which will detect infection with _L.
pneumophila_, serogroup one, responsible for about 70% of human disease,
and sputum culture for _L. pneumophila_.
