Dear Colleagues:

This letter is addressed to the 58 000 readers who haven't yet contributed. (If you've already donated, thank you and apologies for the intrusion).

Thanks to the generosity of donors all over the world, ProMED has brought you in-depth reporting on tuberculosis in India and lead poisoning among eagles in Canada; also, epizootic hemorrhagic disease in white-tailed deer, gastroenteritis in France, avian influenza and chikungunya fever in Indonesia, anthrax in Zimbabwe and India, and rabies in Nepal. And that's just since yesterday afternoon.

Nearly 1000 people, corporations, and other institutions from 52 countries -- your peers and colleagues in the global infectious disease community -- have given money over the past 6 weeks to ensure that ProMED continues to bring you the accurate, relevant, and timely emerging infectious disease reporting that ProMED provides multiple times each day.

If you subscribe to ProMED-mail because it brings you what you need, please help keep ProMED unfettered, uncensored, and free; please donate right now.

96 percent of readers say ProMED is important to their work because:

- ProMED covers the entire One Health spectrum of human, animal, and crop plant diseases.

- ProMED brings news, unique expert interpretation, background, and context that informs you about infectious diseases and helps you understand how they might affect you, your family, your patients, your business, and your plans.

- ProMED is a vital, reliable resource because it promotes sharing and trust among international infectious disease experts in at least 185 countries.

If you believe, as I do, that the information ProMED publishes every day is essential, please go to our website and donate now.

Sincerely yours,

--
Larry Madoff, MD
