More Than 20 Dead, Sick Otters in California
--------------------------------------------
More than 20 sea otters have been discovered dead or sick along a bay in
central California in the past week, and scientists suspect a natural
marine toxin.

The dead or sickened animals represent nearly 1 percent of the wild
population of the southern sea otter, a threatened species protected under
federal law. Many were found comatose or suffering from seizures or muscle
tremors, scientists said Wednesday.

Wildlife experts believe the otters may have eaten mussels, clams and
scallops contaminated with domoic acid -- a naturally occurring toxin found
in algal blooms at this time of year.

Post-mortem examinations on 12 otters and tests on tissue samples are
expected to reveal what killed or sickened the animals.

Other marine mammals, birds and humans can also suffer nervous system
damage from eating shellfish and fish that contain domoic acid.

The state Department of Health Services has warned the public not to eat
sport-caught shellfish in San Luis Obispo County.

Only 2505 otters were counted in their current range between Santa Barbara
and Half Moon Bay during a 2003 census. The population must exceed 3000 to
be taken off the federal government's list of threatened species.

In April 2003, 48 otters died, the highest short-term mortality rate in
modern times. Their deaths were attributed to marine toxins, shark bites
and parasites, including one linked to cat waste.
