BRAIN-DESTROYING PROCESS IDENTIFIED
A team from the University of California, San Francisco, has reported in
Science that it has discovered a type of prion that attaches to a key
structure in neuron cells and triggers a signal that causes the cell to
die.
Dr. Vishwanath R. Lingappa, the primary author, says that the research
reveals a process "that is at the heart of at least one prion disease," but
he said it is not clear if the same process occurs in all prion diseases.
In the latest study, the California researchers used a form of mutated
prion that is different from the BSE prion in a search for an explanation
of how the proteins cause disease. Lingappa was cited as saying they found
that when the abnormal prion is made in the cell, it becomes stuck in a
structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, a membrane that makes proteins
and moves them around within the cell. When the prion is lodged in the
membrane, it triggers a signal that causes the cell to die.
A TRANSMEMBRANE FORM OF THE PRION PROTEIN IN NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE, 6

At the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, the prion protein (PrP) can be
synthesized in several topological forms. The role of these different forms
was explored with transgenic mice expressing PrP mutations that alter the
relative ratios of the topological forms. Expression of a particular
transmembrane form (termed CtmPrP) produced neurodegenerative changes in
mice similar to those of some genetic prion diseases. Brains from these
mice contained CtmPrP but not PrPSc, the PrP isoform responsible for
transmission of prion diseases. Furthermore, in one heritable prion disease
of humans, brain tissue contained CtmPrP but not PrPSc. Thus, aberrant
regulation of protein biogenesis and topology at the endoplasmic reticulum
can result in neurodegeneration.
