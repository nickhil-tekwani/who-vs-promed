Federal and state regulators, trying to limit the spread of potato
root-eating pest, have restricted the handling and movement of
potatoes and farm machinery in a 3500-acre area in southeastern Idaho.
The microscopic worm, called the potato cyst nematode, feeds at the
roots of potato plants and can reduce crop production by 80 percent.
Officials say the pest is not harmful to humans and doesn't have any
effect on the potatoes themselves.
The restrictions imposed last week involve 35 potato growers and 141
potato fields.
"At the very least, we hope to be able to assure our trade partners
Idaho is free of potato cyst nematode. This is one of those steps,"
Wayne Hoffman, spokesman for the state Department of Agriculture,
told the Idaho State Journal.
After the initial discovery of the pest in April, Japan banned all
fresh U.S. potato imports, and Canada and Mexico banned all fresh
potato imports from Idaho.
Idaho is the nation's largest potato producer, growing about 1/3 of
all the potatoes in the United States. During 2005, the state
produced 12.5 billion pounds of potatoes worth about $700 million to farmers.
Hoffman said farmers in the restricted area whose fields are
inspected and declared nematode-free will have green stamps affixed
to their potatoes, which then can be moved without restrictions.
Farmers who do not allow their fields to be checked will have red
stamps placed on their shipments. Those potatoes, Hoffman said, can
only be processed at facilities that can safely handle dirt and water
washed from those potatoes that might contain the nematode.
Hoffman said no potatoes are being grown in fields where nematodes
have been discovered.

[The potato is susceptible to the potato cyst nematode (PCN), which
is found in many places where potatoes are grown, including Europe.
The white or pale PCN (_Globodera pallida_) was reported for the 1st
time in the USA in Idaho 21 Apr 2006 (20060423.1195). Prior to that
report _G. pallida_ was only known in North America in Newfoundland,
Canada (see link for worldwide distribution map). A 2nd infestation,
from a pair of fields in northern Bingham County, south of Idaho
Falls was reported on 14 Jul 2006 (20060805.2161).
This report details the steps that have been taken by federal and
state regulators to label potatoes harvested from within a restricted
area, which includes 35 potato growers and 141 potato fields in 3500
acres in southeastern Idaho. It is not clear to what extent these
measures will result in other countries, including Japan, Korea,
Canada and Mexico, lifting measures to restrict import of Idaho potatoes.

[I believe Idaho potatoes are the kind specified by the McDonald's
hamburger chain to be used to make their french fries, hence this
pest threatens one of their their trademark foods. - Mod.JW]
