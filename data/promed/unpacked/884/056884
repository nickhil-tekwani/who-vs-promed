The Health Ministry says the number of typhoid fever cases has exceeded the outbreak threshold in the Western Division, where there have been 50 cases so far in 2022. There have been 83 confirmed cases of typhoid fever in Fiji in 2022, with 7 new cases last week [week of 28 Mar 2022].

Permanent secretary for health, Dr James Fong, said there is also a slight upward trend in cases noted in the Northern Division last week, driven by a localized outbreak in Cakaudrove and that there have been 13 cases in the North in 2022, with 3 new cases since [Fri 1 Apr 2022]. Dr Fong added that typhoid cases in the Central and Eastern Divisions are below the average or at the average numbers expected for this time of the year.

There have been 5 deaths from typhoid fever so far in 2022.

[Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever, caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a different presentation, often without diarrhea, from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis.

Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive. The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity between the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.

Some strains of the organism have become quite antimicrobial-resistant, particularly ones linked to Pakistan (refer to the See Also section below). Vaccines are available for prevention. - Mod.LL]
