[A] Update 33 - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 17 Apr 2003 4:30 PM
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/sars/update33.html>

As of 17 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 306 probable
or suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in
Canada. There have been 13 deaths in Canada. To date, transmission
has been limited to specific transmission settings such as
households, hospitals, and specific community settings. This update
is based on the information available to Health Canada at this time.
The details of the cases to date are as follows:
Ontario is reporting 123 probable and 128 suspect cases. All cases
have occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact
with SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting.
British Columbia is reporting 4 probable and 39 suspect cases.
New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.
Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.
Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.
Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.
So far, 100 people have been discharged from hospitals in Ontario.
These people were treated as suspect cases or as probable cases.
These numbers are accurate as of 1:00 PM EDST 17 Apr 2003.
[B] From the 16 Apr 2003 Health Professional's update available at:
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/eu-ae/sars20030416_e.html>
The current evidence suggests that respiratory droplet transmission,
requiring close contact with a case of SARS, is the predominant mode
of transmission.
In the province of Ontario the majority of cases have been associated
with specific transmission settings, such as household, hospital, and
specific community groups or settings. There are currently 30 cases
reported amongst approximately 500 members of a religious group in
Toronto. The index case of this community cluster is linked to the
first hospital cluster. The disease spread to a total of 14 members
of the index case's extended family as well as to other members of
the religious group. The key transmission settings include a
gathering held 28-29 Mar 2003, the funeral visitation for the index
case held on 3 Apr 2003, and other social gatherings during and after
these dates. Local health authorities have implemented isolation of
all contacts of suspect and probable cases, including all 500 members
of the religious group, in an effort to contain any further spread
within and outside of this social network. Case finding and contact
tracing efforts in the group are continuing.

[B] Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) Update: Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome --- United States, 2003. 18 Apr 2003
52(15);332-336 [edited] (the full article can be accessed at:
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5215a2.htm>).
In the United States, as of 17 Apr 2003, a total of 208 suspected
SARS cases were reported to CDC from 34 states. Of these, 35 (17
percent) had illness consistent with the WHO case definition for
probable SARS which requires the presence of pneumonia or acute
respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (3), and the remaining 173 ( 83
percent) had fever and milder respiratory symptoms. Of the 35
probable patients, 33 (94 percent) had traveled to mainland China,
Hong Kong, Singapore, or Hanoi; one (3 percent) was a health-care
worker (HCW) who provided care to a SARS patient, and one (3 percent)
was a household contact of a SARS patient. As previously reported, 5
of these 33 patients, all of whom were travelers, had laboratory
evidence of recent infection with a novel coronavirus (4). Although
no additional coronavirus infections have been documented among other
U.S. suspected SARS cases, collection and testing of convalescent
sera (i.e., sera obtained greater than 21 days after illness onset)
for coronavirus infection is ongoing. [Table 1 is a presentation of
epidemiologic data on the reported cases including age distribution
and exposure history; Table 2 is a presentation of characteristics of
the 2 described local transmission pairs. Figure 1 is an updated
epidemic curve by type of exposure and date of onset of case, with
the most recent date of onset recorded as 12 Apr 2003 - Mod.MPP]
SARS Patients with No History of Recent Travel Outside the United States
A total of 19 U.S. residents reported with SARS have no history of
travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, or Hanoi. All
reported close contact with a SARS patient who had traveled recently
to one or more of these areas. 5 of these cases occurred among HCWs
who were exposed to a suspected SARS patient and either did not use
personal protective equipment or removed it while examining the
patient; in only one instance was the SARS patient provided a
surgical mask. Among the 19 close contacts, 2 had illness consistent
with the WHO case definition for a probable case, 4 required
hospitalization, and none is currently hospitalized. 10 have had
acute specimens that tested negative for the novel coronavirus. One
patient also has had a negative convalescent serum.
These 19 patients were close contacts of 16 index patients. Of the 16
index patients, one (6 percent) tested positive for coronavirus
infection, 3 (19 percent) have had a negative serologic test on a
convalescent specimen; results from 12 (75 percent) are pending. 2
(11 percent) index patients had illness consistent with the WHO
definition of a probable SARS case; the 2 instances of local
transmission in the United States involving these patients are
summarized [and can be found in the full text at the given link].
MMWR Editorial Note:
The primary focus of SARS surveillance activities in the United
States is early identification and isolation of patients who have
suspected SARS. Many suspected SARS patients in the United States
have had relatively mild illness and have not required
hospitalization or chest radiographs. The majority of these reported
patients are not likely to have the novel coronavirus infection, as
respiratory illness is common in travelers (5,6). A small number of
persons reported with SARS in the United States had more severe
illness that was consistent with the WHO case definition of probable
SARS. Cases reported to WHO from other countries are probable SARS
cases, whereas the United States has reported all of its suspected
cases (7).
In the United States, local transmission of suspected SARS has been
limited to HCWs and close contacts of suspected SARS patients who
were travelers. Identifying persons who might be at risk for SARS on
arrival to a medical facility or office is difficult and requires
changes in the way medical evaluations are conducted. Revised interim
guidelines for triage recommend that all patients in ambulatory-care
settings be screened promptly for fever, respiratory symptoms, recent
travel, and close contact with a suspected SARS patient (8). CDC has
provided guidance to state and local health departments for
conducting surveillance of HCWs following exposure to a SARS patient.
To prevent secondary transmission, close contacts of SARS patients
should be vigilant for fever or respiratory symptoms. If such
symptoms develop, exposed persons should avoid contact with others,
seek immediate medical attention, and practice infection-control
precautions recommended for SARS patients (9). Household members and
other close contacts of SARS patients should be actively monitored by
the local health department for illness.
CDC continues to develop and refine laboratory testing for the novel
coronavirus that has been implicated as the cause of SARS and has
recently published the nucleic acid sequence of the genome (10).
Incorporating laboratory evidence of coronavirus infection into the
case definition will be important to characterize the clinical
manifestations of coronavirus infection and understand the relation
between infection with this novel coronavirus and SARS.

[A] India - Goa submitted on 17 Apr 2003 by Dr Rana Jawad Asghar
<jawad@alumni.washington.edu>
India has recorded its first confirmed case of the deadly SARS virus,
officials from the National Institute of Virology said Thursday. "We
have received a sample from Goa and it is positive for the corona
virus that is responsible for SARS," said Dr A.C. Mishra, director of
the institute in the western city of Pune. The case involved a man in
the western state of Goa, officials said. "He fell sick 2 days ago.
He is from Goa, but he had been travelling in Hong Kong, Singapore,
Bombay, and then returned to Goa," he said.
[Another newswire report from the Hindustani Times
<http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/181_235567,0008.htm> gave the
following additional information:
SARS has finally hit India, with the government on Thursday
announcing that the virus has been found in the blood, urine, and
sputum samples of a 32-year-old marine engineer in Goa, who is,
however, no longer infective. The marine engineer came to Mumbai on
29 Mar 2003 after a tour of Singapore. He reached Goa on 2 Apr 2003.
"The confirmed SARS patient is being treated in the Goa Medical
College hospital in isolation and is asymptomatic," Director General
of Health Services Dr SP Agarwal told reporters. His contacts,
including his wife (who had travelled with him to Singapore) and
father, are all right and do not have any symptoms, Agarwal said. The
patient had sailed in a ship from Hong Kong and reached Singapore on
30 Mar 2003. He was in Bangkok for 13 hours. He came back to India
and stayed in Mumbai for 3 days. The patient reached Goa on 1 Apr
2003, Agarwal said. He reported with fever and cough on 8 Apr 2003 to
a private doctor and was admitted in Goa Medical College on 10 Apr
2003, Agarwal said, adding the patient responded to conventional
antibiotic treatment and was discharged 2 days later with "home
quarantine" advice. The chest X-ray was normal. However, his blood,
urine, and sputum samples were sent to NIV [National Institute of
Virology], Pune as a precautionary measure, he said. "The tests
confirmed last night that the samples had the new coronavirus that is
causing the SARS epidemic." he said.
[The dates given in the second newswire are a bit confusing and make
it hard to distinguish which case is being referred to, but the
travel dates and the dates of illness are inconsistent. - Mod.MPP]
[B] China - Shanxi from <http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/ED18Ad01.html>
In Shanxi province in central China, in just one hospital in the
provincial capital of Taiyuan alone, there are more than 40 SARS
patients. Owing to its SARS situation worsening significantly in
recent weeks, Shanxi has become a major source of concern. On [15 Apr
2003] the province announced that it had 82 infected patients, 20
times the infection rate in March. As of [15 Apr 2003] 7 people had
died.
Locals say that at most, hospitals have 2 or 3 patients a day. It is
believed that there have been at least 30 suspected SARS cases and 3
deaths in Qingxu. The earliest case of SARS in Qingxu county is said
to be [an individual] of Mayu town, who was infected while in
Guangdong province in February 2003 on official business. Then in
March 2003 an official from the local political consultative
conference went to visit SARS patients in Beijing, during which he
was infected with SARS.
In fact, in early March the World Health Organization (WHO) had
already listed Shanxi as an affected area, with 4 SARS cases. As of
[15 Apr 2003] the number had reached 82 cases. According to a doctor
at Taiyuan Medical University Hospital, his university-affiliated
hospital alone has already treated more than 40 SARS patients, and it
is not even a hospital specializing in SARS. At the Taiyuan Municipal
Infection Hospital it is even more serious.
The earliest case of SARS in Taiyuan was a woman. In March 2003 she
went to Guangdong on official business, and in Taiyuan her diagnosis
was inconclusive. [She] went to Beijing for medical treatment, and
her parents, who were infected while they cared for her, both
ultimately succumbed to SARS. During her treatment, 10 others were
infected.

There was more evidence that not all cases in China were being
reported to the WHO, and a fresh report that the disease is
spreading. The government declared one infection in the remote
western region of Ningxia, but a doctor there said there were 8.
[Ningxia Hue Autonomous Region shares its western border with Inner
Mongolia, where there have been reports of 10 probable cases; see WHO

[D] Bulgaria report denied 17 Apr 2003
<http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=21710>
The Bulgarian Health Ministry [on 16 Apr 2003] denied the reports of
a case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Bulgaria.
According to the Bulgarian News Agency, the woman referred to in the
reports of a local radio station has been diagnosed with probable
pneumonia. The woman has had contact with a diplomat who returned
from China 10 days [ago?], but the diplomat is said to show none of
the symptoms of the disease.
"The Chinese Government is taking all measures to contain the spread
of atypical pneumonia, and thanks to these measures, the epidemic is
under effective control," China's Embassy said in the press release.
The Embassy added that it is not right to suspect every person coming
from China of having atypical pneumonia.

[There continues to be significant newswire coverage of the
transmission in Ontario, Canada, along with which comes much
speculation and concern about more widespread community transmission.
The data shown on the Health Canada website do not support this
concern. However, it would be of interest to see a diagrammatic
representation of the various transmission trees of generations of
cases that have been identified in Ontario.
The Morbidity and Mortality weekly report issued by CDC today (see
[5] [B]) draws attention to the need to revise triage protocols for
early identification of possible suspected cases of SARS presenting
to the outpatient sector. It also is significant that probable cases
are now shown separately from suspected cases, so that reports from
the USA will now be comparable to those from other countries.
Additional newswire reports discuss the one or 2 cases reported from
India (the newswires were confusing). There was also a series of
newswires mentioning a suspected case in a contact of a traveller to
China, occurring in Bulgaria, which has been publicly denied by the
Bulgarian Ministry of Health. - Mod.MPP]
