Japanese encephalitis has claimed 28 lives and 100 patients are being treated in different hospitals in Assam, said a senior official on [Tue 2 Jul 2019].

Dr Umesh Phangcho, Joint Director of health service and state program officer, said: "A 4-member team has been formed with Ministry of Home Affairs Secretary Sanjeev Kumar heading it. They have visited the hospitals where the patients of AES [acute encephalitis syndrome] have been admitted," said Dr Umesh Phangcho.

"The government is keeping a check over the state of AES in Assam and is taking all the necessary measures required to prevent it," he added.

For rehabilitation of JE disabled patients, the Centre has provided funds for the strengthening of 2 Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PMR) departments at Dibrugarh Medical College and Guwahati Medical College.

JE is vector-borne encephalitis transmitted by _Culex_ groups of mosquitoes. These mosquitoes breed mainly in rice fields and large water bodies rich in aquatic vegetations. Migratory birds along with pigs in the community play an important role in the transmission of JE [virus] from one area to other areas.

[There are still more cases reported here, with 28 deaths and 100 cases. The report above uses the term "Japanese encephalitis" (JE) as well as "acute encephalitis syndrome" (AES) that has been used in previous reports from Assam as well. There is no indication how many cases are confirmed JE virus infections and how many are not JE but are classified as AES cases. As mentioned in previous posts, where laboratory confirmation is available, usually these encephalitis cases are attributed to JE in a minority of cases, with AES of unspecified etiology for the majority. This is the season for JE virus, but AES also occurs at this time. As noted in many earlier posts, the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. - Mod.TY]

In Assam, 21 people have died due to a Japanese encephalitis [JE] outbreak, which has reportedly had 69 cases of the disease, a senior official of the Union Health ministry said [Mon 1 Jul 2019] after a central team reviewed the situation here.

"There are 2 crucial months to come: July and August [2019]. The challenge would be to contain the outbreak to the minimum in the next 2 months," Additional Secretary Sanjeev Kumar, who led the 4-member central team, said.

After a review meeting with the state health department officials in Guwahati, Kumar told waiting journalists that the state health department is "very" active, and things are "under control. We have reviewed the situation with health department officials of the state. So far, 21 deaths have taken place out of the 69 reported cases of JE. I also reviewed the immunisation status, which is vital to prevention of incidence of JE," he said.

"We are chalking out the strategy this month [July 2019] to contain the spread of the disease in these 2 months, when the highest number of cases are registered," Kumar added.

The 4-member central team, including senior officials from the National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme, visited the state to take stock of the situation on the instructions of Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan.

Principal Secretary, Assam Health and Family Welfare Department, Samir K Sinha, said: "We have earmarked certain beds in the ICUs for patients suffering from JE to ensure they get prompt medical treatment."

Joint Director Health Services, malaria, U Fangso, said most of the upper Assam districts, including Jorhat, Golaghat, Dibrugarh, and Lakhimpur, and lower Assam district Kamrup were affected by the mosquito-borne disease.

[The numbers of reports JE cases in Assam state have increased from 10 deaths and 35 additional cases on 28 Jun 2019 to the 21 deaths and 69 cases reported above. This is the active JE virus transmission season there, so health officials are prudent to evaluate the situation and take measures to reduce incidence of the disease, because more cases can be expected. Immunization is the effective measure needed to avoid infections. Mosquito vector control is difficult. The report above indicates that health officials have reviewed the immunization status but not stated of whom or what the findings are.

Vaccination for JE was carried out in the affected areas last year (2018). It is not mentioned whether vaccination was carried out again this year (2019). The type of JE vaccine used previously is not mentioned. If it is an inactivated vaccine, the duration of immunity may not be long-lasting. Attenuated live vaccine would provide longer immunity. - Mod.TY
