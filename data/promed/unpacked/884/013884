The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries ordered a nationwide
investigation into the extent of mad cow disease (BSE, Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy) infections following the suspected case at a Chiba
Prefecture farm.
The ministry said the emergency on-the-spot probe will cover a total of
about 4.5 million cows - about 1.7 million dairy cows and roughly 2.8
million beef cattle - at some 140 000 farms. The probe is to check
whether there are irregularities suspected of being linked to BSE.
The ministry said it instructed all of Japan's 47 prefectural governments
to conduct probes at farms to see whether cows have shown signs of the
disease, such as difficulty standing.
The probe will also look into whether farmers fed their cows "meat and
bone meal (MBM)," a protein feed made from the crushed internal organs,
skin and bones of cows.

The northern Hokkaido Island, Japan's top cattle-breeding area, would
check all 1.27 million cows in its region an official in the local
government's dairy farming and livestock division said.
The ministry said the infected cow had been born in Hokkaido 5 years ago
and had been moved to the Chiba area near Tokyo 3 years ago It said the
remains of the slaughtered cow would be sent to Britain for further tests
to confirm the disease.
The government played down the chance of a serious outbreak of the kind
that destroyed confidence in British beef in the mid-1990s, but said
farmers would be required to report any suspected cases of the disease,
formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
Officials and experts said the most likely cause was infected imports of
meat-and-bone meal (MBM) from Europe - the same way the disease spread
from Britain to the rest of Europe.
Japan banned all cattle-related products from the European Union earlier
this year, but had previously imported animal feedstuff, including MBM,
from Britain and other EU nations.
Last year, it imported about 55 000 tons of meat-and-bone meal from
Denmark and Italy, which have since suffered outbreaks, although Japanese
officials said these products would have been heat-treated before being
used. [Heat treatment will not inactivate the prion believed to be the agent
responsible for BSE. - Mod.TG
Takebe said an investigation had begun into how the cow was infected,
adding an examination would be made of the MBM used at the cow's farm in
Chiba prefecture near Tokyo.
Given that the disease has an incubation period of between 2 and 8 years,
the 5-year-old cow could have been infected some time ago, possibly by
British MBM imports, which Japan only banned in 1996.
The Health Ministry has banned sales of meat products from the farm, and
said that could be extended to other areas.
