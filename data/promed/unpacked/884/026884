2 Mule Deer Test Positive For Chronic Wasting Disease
---------------------------------------------------
2 mule deer captured in the Organ Mountains as part of an ongoing
research project near White Sands Missile Range have tested positive
for chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal neurological disease that
attacks the brains of infected deer and elk, the Department of Game
and Fish announced.

The number of confirmed CWD cases in New Mexico now stands at 11
since 2002, when the disease was first confirmed in a deer found near
the eastern foothills of the Organ Mountains. All 11 CWD-infected
deer were found in the same general area of southern New Mexico. The
origin of the disease in New Mexico remains unknown. The carcasses of
the infected deer will be incinerated, said Kerry Mower, the
Department's lead wildlife disease biologist.

Mower said the most recent CWD-positive deer showed no obvious
physical signs of having the disease. They were captured in April
2005 and tested as part of a 3-year-old research project studying
deer population dynamics in southern New Mexico. More than 140 deer
have been captured alive and tested for the study, in which
researchers hope to find the cause of a 10-year decline in the area
deer population. Study participants include the Department of Game
and Fish, the U.S. Army at White Sands Missile Range and Fort Bliss,
Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Geological Survey at New Mexico State
University, and San Andres National Wildlife Refuge.

Hunters can assist the Department in its CWD research and prevention
efforts by bringing their fresh, legally harvested deer or elk head
to an area office, where officers will remove the brain stem for
testing. Participants will be eligible for drawings for an oryx hunt
on White Sands Missile Range and a trophy elk hunt on the Valle
Vidal. For more information about the drawing and chronic wasting
disease, visit the Department web site at

[Members are strongly encouraged to view the NM CWD map at the URL
below. In 2004 they tested 997 deer, each shown. These recent deer
are clustered with the others just to the east of Las Cruces in
southern New Mexico. The absence of cases elsewhere in the state at
this level of surveillance increases one's confidence in the reality
of this specific high-risk area. The origin of their infection is
still obscure.

The New Mexico CWD website is:
<http://www.wildlife.state.nm.us/conservation/disease/cwd/>
<http://www.wildlife.state.nm.us/conservation/disease/cwd/where_is_it.htm>
Unfortunately, other than their admirable map, they have not been
updated since 14 Jun 2004.

The site being close to Texas and to Mexico has spawned speculation,
but as yet without foundation. In the past 3 years Texas has tested
some 9103 deer out of a target population estimate of 3 917 926, all
negative. For details of the Texas Chronic Wasting Management Plan,
