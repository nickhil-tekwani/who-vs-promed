RANGAMATI, Dec 26: Diarrhoea has been spreading in an epidemic form at
[the Choto Harina and Bara Harina areas in Barkal thana and in Balukhali
union of sadar thana. Seven persons died and 200 others have [contracted
the disease. In remote areas of both Choto Harina and Bara Harina five
persons died of diarrhoea [between 9 Dec 1998 and 13 Dec 1998.
According to chairman of Balukhali Union Mayadhan Chakma, two persons died
of diarrhoea, while two children have been admitted to Rangamati General
Hospital from Kainda Dosari para.
Rangamati District Health Department said, to control further spread of the
disease five medical teams have been working in Harina area. Besides BDR,
Army doctors are also working there. They have [had medicines sent to the
area to control the
situation.
A special team of the district Public Health Engineering Department [will
be heading toward the area soon. Meanwhile, all the tubewells of the area
went out of order and
people are forced to drink lake water.
According to Barkal Thana Health Complex officials, the affected patients
are being brought in the thana hospital [for treatment. This process is
very time-consuming as the affected places are in remote areas and far away
from the hospital.
Health officials assured this correspondent [that more medical teams [are
being sent to the affected areas.

[Reports of fatal cases due to "diarrhea" regularly come out of Bangladesh.
In
contrast to other countries, the reports never give the name of the causative
agent, so it is not possible to know whether it is salmonellosis,
shigellosis or
cholera. Which is strange, since the world-famous ICDDR-B (International
Centre
for Diarrhoeal Disease Research - Bangladesh) is located in the country. If
anyone has details of the laboratory findings from these outbreaks, they
would be
performing a public service in letting us know -- and if it is cholera, they
should tell WHO. - Mod.JW
