For the attention of cattle and beef products importers
-------------------------------------------------------
A routine test of imported cattle for bluetongue (a highly dangerous
disease), which is a compulsory test for import to Russia,
demonstrated that cattle imported from Germany to one of the RF
oblasts (let it be Oblast “C”) was infected with the virus.

According to the preliminary data obtained from the Russian National
Reference Centre for Bluetongue (the All-Russian Scientific-Research
Institute for Veterinary Virology and Microbiology, Pokrov) and
discussed with specialists from the OIE World Reference Centre for BT
(Pirbright Laboratories, UK) we may assume that it is very likely a
new virus serotype that has not been previously reported in central
and northern parts of Russia. Perhaps, it is a brand-new serotype that
has never existed in the world and has emerged due to the wide spread
of infection in Europe over the past years (mutation and following
selection).

If it is so, then we are dealing with a virus with unknown
characteristics (including unclear pathogenicity and epidemic
potential).

It is obvious that the virus and its characteristics will be further
studied, until we get a definite answer to the questions related to
national safety. Also the cattle imported from Germany over this
period will be randomly reinspected, and Russian cattle in Oblast
“C” will be inspected. We will study the possibility of infecting
Russian animals due to natural introduction of the new virus into our
territory.

It is necessary to note that the German National Veterinary Service
declared that their territory is free from bluetongue. According to
the data obtained, it is very likely an unsupported allegation.

It is quite possible that we will have to impose restrictions on the
importation of cattle from Germany, thus, suspending previously issued
permits for 2012. In case the virus turns out to be myotropic [affect
the muscle/meat], an equivalent ban on import of raw beef products
(non-heat-treated) should not be excluded.

The situation is complicated by the fact that the cattle were imported
from Germany with a transit stop in Poland followed by unloading of
the cattle (we will have to find solid confirmation of that fact).
Besides, the cattle were unloaded in summer when blood-sucking insects
carrying bluetongue virus from animal to animal are active.

Therefore, I suppose we will have to impose these restrictions on
Poland. In case we confirm the virus is dangerous and if we do not get
accurate information where the cattle were infected (in Germany or in
Poland), I suppose we will have to impose restrictions on both
countries.

Finally, the most unpleasant thing is that we will have to suspend all
imports of potentially hazardous products (animals, non-heat-treated
meat products and poultry products from all species of farm animals
and poultry) from this country, if we get conclusive evidence that the
declaration of the German National Veterinary Service about freedom
from the highly dangerous disease is not sufficiently guaranteed,
thus, putting biosafety of our country at risk. In this case we will
have to start a comprehensive audit of the Official Veterinary
Surveillance system in Germany, taking into account the fragmented
structure of the Veterinary Services of the country.

I also consider it is not necessary to impose resections on the meat
before mid-March, because it is not the time when bloodsucking insects
carrying bluetongue virus are active. This is the so-called free
season (no insects).

I will further inform you on the course of events.

On the situation with the arrival from Germany to Russia of a
consignment of cattle infected with bluetongue
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As previously reported, during routine investigations of blood serum
of cattle imported from Germany to Russia, a bluetongue virus has been
detected, presumably of a new serotype.

In this regard, the head of Rosselkhoznadzor Sergei Dankvert sent a
letter to Paola Testori Coggi, Director General of the Directorate
General for Health and Consumers [SANCO], the European Commission.
Sergei Dankvert expressed very serious concern about the event, and
asked the European Commission to send, as soon as possible, veterinary
experts to the Smolensk region of Russia for blood sampling of animals
from the infected group of animals, for operational research in the
world reference center for bluetongue in Pirbright, UK. Sergei
Dankvert also pointed out that parallel blood samples could be
investigated in the Veterinary Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI) on
the island of Riems in Germany.

[Russia's official history of its bluetongue situation is the
following:

Bluetongue (an officially notifiable disease) has been absent since
1994, reoccurring in 2008.

In Russia's 2008 annual reports to the OIE, bluetongue was reported to
be present, during 2008, as a clinical entity in cattle, in the
following provinces (number of outbreaks in brackets): Belgorodskaya
oblast (1), Kaluzhskaya oblast (2), Kurskaya oblast (1), Lipetskaya
oblast (2), Stavropopl'skiy kray (1), Yaroslavskaya oblast (3); total
10 clinical outbreaks in 6 administrative territories.

In the annual reports for 2009, the disease was reported as present in
3 oblasts: Kaluzhskaya (3 outbreaks), Nizhegodskaya (1) and
Kaliningradskaya (1), all 5 outbreaks as "confirmed
infection/infestation without clinical signs".

In 2010, the disease was, reportedly, similarly to 2009, present as
"confirmed infection/infestation without clinical signs"; no further
details were provided.

In the semi-annual report for 2011 (January - June), bluetongue was
reported from the Kaluzhskaya oblast in March ("Disease present with
quantitative data but with unknown number of outbreaks").

No immediate notification was sent to the OIE in 2008, when the
disease recurred in Russia after its absence since 1994, nor later,
and no data on the serotype(s) involved has been included in the
annual/semiannual reports.

Some additional information is available in the report No RS1065
(dated 5 Nov 2010) of USDA's Global Agricultural International Network
(GAIN), titled "Epizootic Situation in Russia":

"Until recently, Russian veterinarians had not registered the disease
in the Russian Federation since 1994. The first cases of positive
tests of bluetongue appeared in imported cattle in 2008. The
veterinary service tested 4194 head of cattle for bluetongue during
the first quarter of 2010 and did not reveal any positive animals.
However, after the tests of 6116 head of cattle in the second quarter
of 2010, 58 of the 333 animals tested in Kaluga Oblast turned up
positive". For the said report, see
http://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/Epizootic%20Situation%20in%20Russia_Moscow_Russian%20Federation_11-5-2010.pdf

The results of a serological survey of livestock in Kazakhstan,
carried out in 1997-1998, involving 958 animals (cattle, sheep and
goats), resulted in an overall seroprevalence for BT virus of 23
percent (cattle - cattle 25.4, sheep 21.4 and goats 25.5).
Seropositive animals were widespread suggesting endemicity, despite
the disease not having being previously reported. Few animals were
found seropositive for another orbivirus, namely EHDV: 8 cattle (2.9
percent) and 2 sheep (0.4 percent). (See Ref 1).

The All-Russian Scientific-Research Institute for Veterinary Virology
and Microbiology, Pokrov, which is the performer of the present
investigation in Russia, was engaged also in the first identification
of bluetongue in Russia in 1994 (Vishnyakov et al, cited in Ref 1).
Have sero-surveys in large and small ruminants been conducted later,
particularly during the 2000's, in Russian territories, those adjacent
or of geo-ecological status similar to the ones in Kazakhstan, as well
as elsewhere?

In Kazakhstan, bluetongue is, reportedly, not included in the list of
notifiable diseases. In the reports submitted to the OIE for the years
2005-2010, it was referred to as "not reported" and its last date of
occurrence was "unknown".

It will be essential to have the suspected samples in question,
derived in Russia, forwarded at the earliest to the OIE World
Reference Centre for BT for further analysis, genotyping and
eventually serotyping. Until recently, 25 serotypes of the BT virus
were scientifically recognised. A novel serotype, collected from sheep
in Kuwait in 2010, has reportedly been identified at Pirbright, by
genotyping, in 2011 as a novel serotype designated BTV-26 (Ref 2).

The date of the sampling and further details on the chronology,
geography, epidemiology and on the animal population involved in the
current event in Russia will be helpful.
