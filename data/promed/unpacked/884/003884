The number of suspected typhoid fever cases in Tuburan town, north west Cebu Province has risen to more than 800 patients, said a Department of Health (DOH)-Central Visayas official. The province's count is even higher: chief of the Integrated Provincial Health Office (IPHO) Dr Cristina Giango said on Tuesday, 6 Mar 2012, that there were 999 suspected typhoid cases, including outpatients.

Neighboring towns, the provincial government and line agencies are pitching in to contain the outbreak, from cleaning up the water supply to distributing medicine, relief goods and pledges to pay for hospital bills. Provincial social welfare officer Marivic Garces told the governor that 50 sacks of rice and 30 cartons of canned goods were already delivered and distributed to the affected residents.

Rennan Cimafranca, DOH-Central Visayas epidemiologist, said the cases were identified based on the clinical manifestations of the patients whom health officials examined. These manifestations include fever, headache, stomach ache, distended stomach, joint pains, and lack of appetite. Cimafranca said the typhoid outbreak has not yet been contained and may take some time.

Cimafranca also said the health agency has distributed medicines, such as antibiotics and antipyretics for those with fever, and sent 5 blood samples for confirmatory typhoid testing at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Manila.

So far, 4 deaths have been recorded since the typhoid outbreak was reported over the weekend. Garcia said two chlorinators are already operating, with the help of the office of the town mayor and local social welfare office.

Engr. Adolfo Quiroga, Provincial Planning and Development Office (PPDO) head, said they had already inspected Sitio Magdagook of Barangay Calangahan's pipes for any leaks. Water quality continues to be monitored in the town's three water sources in
Barangays Marmol, Calangahan, and Alegria. Garcia said these pipes were installed during her second term, from 2007 to 2010. Local officials suspect the connections were damaged by the earthquake that hit Cebu and Negros Oriental on 6 Feb 2012.

The Philippine Army's 78th Infantry Battalion also put up tents and folding beds in an open area near the hospital, to accommodate the growing number of patients.

About 3000 cases of typhoid have been reported in Zimbabwe's capital Harare since the 1st case was detected in a working-class suburb in January 2012, state media have reported. "At the moment we have over 3000 cases, both suspected and confirmed," The Sunday Mail newspaper quoted Prosper Chonzi, the city's health services director, as saying.

More than 90 people from one of the capital's suburbs, Kuwadzana, were admitted to hospital in January 2012. Health authorities banned open-air food vending to try to curb the spread of the disease. "Our worry is that typhoid is now spreading to other areas adjacent to Kuwadzana," Chonzi said.

"We are now moving into the unaffected areas so that we can educate people about the spread of typhoid. The city has found it better to concentrate on preventive measures rather than corrective measures."

Health minister Henry Madzorera has said the government had no money to deal with the typhoid outbreak, which has since spread to other provinces. Some suburbs go for weeks without running water as Zimbabwean municipalities struggle to keep up services. Last October 2011, more than 6000 cases of diarrhea were reported in the southern towns of Masvingo and Kadoma and children were the worst affected. 4 years ago over 4000 people died of cholera in an outbreak which affected nearly 100 000 people.

A public health emergency has been declared for two villages in Fiji, after an outbreak of typhoid in the Western Division. Under the ban, which will be reassessed after 30 days, mass gatherings and the slaughtering of animals are forbidden.

The World Health Organization's communicable diseases leader in Fiji, Dr Jacob Kool, told Radio Australia's Pacific Beat that typhoid is always a problem in Fiji. "Fiji has one of the highest rates in the world of typhoid fever," he said. "But we know it always gets worse when there is a natural disaster. It just comes down to a lack of good sanitation and a lack of good hygenic practises," he said. And Mr Kool said more needs to be done to protect water sources. "People should not be using the river as a toilet as well as a source of drinking water and unfortunately in the Highlands of Fiji that is still a practice."

[Neither the banning of mass gatherings nor the slaughtering of animals is likely to have an impact on the incidence of _Salmonella_ Typhi infection, which is spread through water or food contaminated with human feces, as the infection, unlike other salmonelloses, is not a zoonosis. - Mod.LL
