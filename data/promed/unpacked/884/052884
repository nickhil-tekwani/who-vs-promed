Grapevine fabavirus -- a new virus of grapevine
-----------------------------------------------
A new virus tentatively named Grapevine fabavirus (_Fabavirus_, GFabV) has recently been reported in California (USA). This virus was detected (NGS) during the testing of 2 selections of Japanese table grapes (_Vitis vinifera_ cvs. Black Beet and Nagano Purple) which had been introduced from the Republic of Korea in 2013 (Foundation Plant Services, Davis).

GFabV could be graft-transmitted to cv. Cabernet Franc. GFabV was then also detected in 2 additional grapevine selections, one from India and the other from the Republic of Korea. In California, surveys and biological studies will be conducted to determine the prevalence of GFabV, evaluate its potential natural spread, and assess its impact on grapevine.

In later studies conducted in China, the presence of GFabV was detected in grapevine material (_V. vinifera_ cv. Ruby seedless grafted on _V. riparia_ x _V. labrusca_) showing chlorotic mottling and leaf deformation. It was also concluded that more studies were needed to determine the effects of GFabV on grapevine.

[Most recently, the virus was also detected in South Korea, see link below - Mod.DHA]

Multiple viruses identified in grapevine leafroll diseased vineyards
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Surveys of viruses affecting grapevines in the wine regions of the Western Cape Province of South Africa were conducted. The 1st, during the 2010 growing season, was aimed at determining the spread of a newly discovered vitivirus, Grapevine virus E (GVE). The 2nd focused on plants showing typical grapevine leafroll disease (GLD) symptoms.

In South Africa grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV-3) is the virus most consistently associated with GLD. The current study determined genetic variation among GLRaV-3 isolates, as well as the relative abundance of 5 GLRaV-3 genetic variants in GLD-affected vines. In addition, the viral diversity for individual vines was determined in order to provide an overview of the most abundant viruses in vineyards from the different wine growing regions.

A total of 315 plants were analysed over 2 growing seasons. 5 GLRaV-3 variants were detected as either single or mixed infections, with GLRaV-3 variant groups II and VI being the most prominent as single infections, and in combinations with each other and other variants. An analysis of the distribution of variants per region showed that single infections of variant groups II and VI occurred predominantly in certain regions and were equally distributed in red and white cultivars. Infection with variant groups II and VI were the most abundant with 49.8 and 47.6 per cent, respectively, followed by variant groups I, III, and VI.

Mixed infections by 36 different virus combinations were found in 251 plants. The most abundant virus combination was GLRaV-3 with Grapevine virus E (GVE), in 28 per cent of the plants. GLRaV-3 was the predominant virus detected in the samples with a frequency of 80 per cent, followed by GVE, Grapevine rupestris stem pitting-associated virus (GRSPaV), Grapevine virus A (GVA), Grapevine virus F (GVF), Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 2 (GLRaV-2), Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 1 (GLRaV-1) and Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 4 (GLRaV-4 like).

The complexity of virus populations detected highlights the need for detection methods able to identify all grapevine-infecting viruses and variants that will benefit the monitoring of disease spread and efficient management of GLD.

[Item [1]
--------
The new grapevine fabavirus was initially identified by large scale sequencing (NGS) in the US from _Vitis vinifera_. Its closest relative in the genus was reported to be _Broad bean wilt virus 2_. It appears to be the 1st report of a member of the genus in grapevine. It was shown to be graft transmissible, but no association with any symptoms was reported.

In a subsequent report from China, graft transmitted GFabV was associated with chlorotic mottling and leaf deformation in plants that tested positive for GFabV and negative for other viruses. In the most recent report from South Korea, symptoms such as leaf malformations, vein clearing and yellowing were reported from some GFabV infected plants, with a majority of plants remaining asymptomatic. In both China and South Korea, several _Vitis_ species and hybrids were assessed.

Members of genus _Fabavirus_ (type member _Broad bean wilt virus 1_) are generally spread by aphids. Further work is needed to investigate a possible role of GFabV isolates in diseases of _Vitis_ species and a potential impact on grape production.

Item [2]
--------
Grapevine leafroll is one of the most important viral diseases in grapevines and occurs wherever grapevines are grown. At least 9 different grapevine leafroll-associated viruses (GLRaVs) belonging to different genera within the family Closteroviridae have been reported. Typical leafroll symptoms include downward rolling and interveinal reddening or yellowing of leaves, as well as reduced fruit size, sugar content and yield. Several species of mealy bugs and soft scales (families Pseudococcidae and Coccidae, respectively) have been reported as vectors for GLRaV 3. Similar vectors are thought to be involved in the spread of some of the other GLRaVs. All of the GLRaVs are also spread by grafting and have been widely distributed and accumulated in their long-lived host over time by human activities. Symptoms of viral leafroll disease vary on different grape varieties resulting in very serious disease in some varieties and no symptoms at all in others. These latter 'latent' infections are a particular threat as a source of diseased grafting material. Generic molecular diagnostic methods for Closteroviridae have been developed and can be used to ensure virus-free rootstocks and budwood.

_Grapevine virus A_ (GVA; genus _Vitivirus_) and other vitiviruses (currently including GVs A-F) are spread by grafting and similar vectors to GLRaVs. Members in the genus are implicated as causal agents of the grapevine rugose wood disease complex. An estimated yield loss of over 20 per cent has been attributed to GVA, depending on grape cultivar and location, even in asymptomatic infections. In some leafroll affected table grape cultivars, it may lead to decline and death of plants. _Grapevine rupestris stem pitting-associated virus_ (genus _Foveavirus_) has been reported in association with vitiviruses and is suspected to be involved in diseases like corky bark (ProMED-mail post 20150924.3669131). In South Africa, GVA as well as _Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3_ have been associated with a disease of Shiraz grapes.

In long lived and graft propagated crops like grapevine, viruses and viroids can accumulate over many generations, leading to general decline of plants and severe yield reductions. Disease management of grapevine viruses may include vector control and phytosanitation, such as removal of infected plants and disinfection of vineyard tools. Use of certified virus free planting material (including tissue cultures, rootstocks, and scions for grafting) is essential.
