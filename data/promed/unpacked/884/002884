The Clinic for the Rehabilitation of Animals (CROW) is seeing more and more patients as red tide takes over Southwest Florida's beaches. At CROW, veterinarians are busy dealing with the effects of red tide.

"We're working on about 1/2 a dozen right now, mostly cormorants, and we have a sanderling that was found here on Sanibel, but mostly just cormorants for now," said Steve Greenstein, CROW Executive Director. The birds ate fish killed by the toxic algae in the water, causing a neurological affect.

"It puts them in what's called a down position; when you find them, they'd be disorientated; they usually can't stand up, have trouble breathing; really, it's a poison in their system," Greenstein said. All of the birds found by citizens who called CROW to rescue them had similar symptoms.

"When you walk up to them, they don't walk away, or if they are walking, they really just look like a drunk sailor. ... They stagger; they have a lot of intention tremors with their heads and really just look like a drunk bird," said Dr. Aundria West of CROW.

There's no cure for red tide poisoning, so CROW does what they can. "It's a toxin. There's not really much you can do as far as anti-toxin against it; you just have to wait for the body to clear it out, so the best way is to pump them full of fluids, get things flushed out, and just provide some food," West said.

Within 24 hours, vets know whether the bird is going to make it. Once they seem strong enough, they graduate to an outside enclosure. "At CROW, were here for one reason, and that's release; that's really our goal here from start to finish," Greenstein said.

[Red tide, or harmful algal blooms (HABs), are events in which single-celled protists, dinoflagellates, proliferate rapidly and accumulate in the water column. These events are associated with wildlife mortalities because, under certain circumstances, these organisms can produce potent toxins. Normally, these toxins enter the food web when they are consumed by filter feeding animals, such as clams, oysters, and mussels, in which the toxin bio-accumulates. _Karenia brevis_ is a marine dinoflagellate common in Gulf of Mexico waters and is the organism responsible for Florida red tides. The toxin it produces is called brevetoxin, which can cause neurotoxic shellfish poisoning.

People should avoid consuming marine animals that accumulate the toxins, such as hard-shell clams, soft-shell clams, oysters, mussels, and scallops.
