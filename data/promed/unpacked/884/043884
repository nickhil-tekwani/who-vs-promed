(In response to the previous posting) We recently investigated the issue of
protection against Murray Valley encephalitis virus [MVEV by vaccination
with inactivated Biken Japanese encephalitis virus [JEV vaccine in a mouse
model (A collaboration between the University of Western Australia and the
University of Queensland). The results of which should be in print any day
now (Broom, A.K., Wallace, M., Mackenzie, J.S and Hall, R.A. Immunization
with gamma globulin to MVEV and with an inactivated JEV vaccine as a
prophylaxis against Australian encephalitis: evaluation in a mouse model.
Journal of Medical Virology, In press). Briefly our findings were that
antibodies generated by immunization with a range of doses of Biken vaccine
failed to protect against MVEV when passively transferred to recipient
mice. In fact when lower doses of the Biken vaccine were used an unexpected
but reproducible phenomenon occurred - recipient mice succumbed more
quickly to MVEV challenge than did the controls. This apparent enhancement
of infection by antibody raised to inactivated JEV antigens was later
reproduced by passively transferring subneutralising levels of antibody
raised to heat-inactivated JEV to recipient mice challenged with MVEV.
(M.J.Wallace, D.W.Smith, A.K.Broom, J.S.MacKenzie, R.A.Hall, G.R.Shellam
and P.C.McMinn. 1999 Antibody-mediated enhancement of Murray Valley
encephalitis virus replication in mice. Poster presentation at the X1th
International Congress of Virology , Sydney).
While these findings cast some doubt on the wisdom of vaccinating with a
killed JEV vaccine in a region where MVEV is active, the above experiments
have only demonstrated enhancement of infection using adoptive transfer of
antiserum. The additional effects of immune B and T cell populations, which
are also stimulated by vaccination, need to be investigated before a true
indication of the potential risk of JEV vaccination on a population exposed
to MVEV infection can be determined. The mechanism of the enhanced onset of
disease observed in the mouse model remains a focus of our research.
In contrast to the lack of protection provided by inactivated JEV antigens,
antibodies generated by sublethal infection with live JEV virus produced
partial but significant protection against challenge with MVEV when
transferred to recipient mice. Whether this is due to the generation of
higher levels of antibody by infection compared to immunization with killed
antigen, or is the result of a bias of antibody toward epitopes that induce
stronger protection or the involvement of protective antibodies to the
nonstructural protein NS1 which are induced in response to infection but
not by vaccination with the killed purified virus in the Biken preparation,
remains to be clarified. In summary our preliminary findings indicate that
immunization with an inactivated JEV vaccine does not provide protection
against MVEV and that vaccination with an attenuated form of JEV may be
more effective!

[Antibody mediated enhancement (AME) is thought to be a principal mechanism
in the development of dengue hemorrhagic fever in people who have had prior
infections with a different dengue virus. AME also has been shown to occur
with bunyavirus infections and may be an important mechanism in infections
with other viruses. We are grateful to Roy and his associates for sharing
their unpublished data with our readers. As there may be Australian
soldiers who have had the JEV vaccine and are involved in military
exercises in areas where MVEV occurs, we may have an unfortunate but
inevitable experiment ongoing. - Mod.CHC
