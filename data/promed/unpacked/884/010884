An aggressive and potentially dangerous type of mosquito has shown up in
Portland [Oregon. The Asian tiger mosquito, [_Aedes albopictus_ which
gets its name from the stripes on its legs, reportedly hitchhiked from
Southeast Asia in a shipment of plants.
The aggressive daytime biters appeared at a northwest Portland importing
business in a shipment of lucky bamboo [_Dracaena_ species that was packed
in water. Vector control is worried about the bugs, but has so far found
only about 10 -- not enough to raise fears of a major infestation.

[Information on the embargo on the importation of _Dracaena_ shipments in
standing water is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/r010702.htm> and in the cited
posting "Ae. albopictus, imported - USA (S.California) (02) 20010704.1280".
It would be of interest to find out in what other states, if any, _Ae.
albopictus_ has been identified in association with _Dracaena_ species in
which the shipments of the plants included standing water. - Man. Ed. DS
