[1] Covidengue: coinfection with dengue
[A] Mexico: 2nd case
Date: Fri 25 Sep 2020

https://www.theyucatantimes.com/2020/09/a-five-year-old-girl-is-the-second-registered-case-of-covidengue/


The Secretariat of Health and Social Welfare of Colima reported that a 2nd case of the coexistence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the dengue virus, now called Covidengue, was registered in a girl under 5 years of age , who is a resident of the municipality of Minatitlan, in the Mexican state of Colima. "Currently, the patient is at home, totally stable, recovering without complications and continuing her treatment for both diseases", it was reported in a statement.

"The patient is a beneficiary of the IMSS (Mexican Social Security), and on [8 Sep 2020], the symptoms began and she was taken to consultation until [11 Sep 2020], applying the test for COVID-19 and dengue on [13 and 14 Sep 2020], and both tests turned out to be positive, "said the Secretary of Health, Leticia Guadalupe Delgado Carrillo.

She added that from the epidemiological investigation it is known that within the symptoms were fever, headache, and muscle pain, adding in the following hours irritability, abdominal pain, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, and loss of consciousness, for what she was hospitalized. After she remained hospitalized and under constant observation, the patient improved, which is why on [15 Sep 2020] it was decided to discharge her from the hospital and to continue her treatment on an outpatient basis.

In this regard, the head of the Ministry of Health called on parents not to wait for alarm signs to appear before going to the doctor in both minors and older adults for any condition that has a sudden onset of fever and headache. And he insisted on the population to get rid of any container or object that could be a reservoir for the reproduction of the transmitter vector, through the reproduction of larvae that can be generated in the breeding sites.

[A rapid review of PubMed search for dengue and COVID-19 found reports of coinfections in Reunion (ref 1), Singapore (2,3), Thailand (2,4), India (2), Bangladesh (2), Mayotte (5), and Pakistan (8). In addition there were reports in ProMED-mail on cases in India (COVID-19 update (357): coinfections, sequelae, selected countries, WHO, global 20200813.7673720) and Indonesia (Dengue/DHF update (08): Asia, Pacific 20200722.7600880). In recent days the lay press has reported on the cases in Mexico (above), and 3 cases in Belize (https://www.breakingbelizenews.com/2020/09/24/52-new-cases-of-covid-19-identified-including-3-cases-of-co-infection-with-dengue/) and India (https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/covid19-delhi-deputy-cm-manish-sisodia-condition-plasma-therapy-coronavirus-dengue-1725508-2020-09-25). The intriguing observation has been an apparent cross-reactivity between the 2 viruses serologically (6,7). 2 different virus families (coronavirus and flavivirus) yet possible cross reactivity... Clearly there is much room for further studies on the cross-reactivity as well as the co-infection (and, after reading 1B below, is there a protective effect of dengue antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 infections?

A new study that analyzed the coronavirus outbreak in Brazil has found a link between the spread of the virus and past outbreaks of dengue fever that suggests exposure to the mosquito-transmitted illness may provide some level of immunity against COVID-19.

The not yet published study led by Miguel Nicolelis, a professor at Duke University, and shared exclusively with Reuters, compared the geographic distribution of coronavirus cases with the spread of dengue in 2019 and 2020. Places with lower coronavirus infection rates and slower case growth were locations that had suffered intense dengue outbreaks this year [2020] or last [2019], Nicolelis found. "This striking finding raises the intriguing possibility of an immunological cross-reactivity between dengue's Flavivirus serotypes and SARS-CoV-2," the study said, referring to dengue virus antibodies and the novel coronavirus.

"If proven correct, this hypothesis could mean that dengue infection or immunization with an efficacious and safe dengue vaccine could produce some level of immunological protection" against the coronavirus, it added.

Nicolelis told Reuters the results are particularly interesting because previous studies have shown that people with dengue antibodies in their blood can test falsely positive for COVID-19 antibodies even if they have never been infected by the coronavirus. "This indicates that there is an immunological interaction between 2 viruses that nobody could have expected, because the 2 viruses are from completely different families," Nicolelis said, adding that further studies are needed to prove the connection.

The study was being published ahead of peer review on the MedRxiv preprint server and will be submitted to a scientific journal. It highlights a significant correlation between lower incidence, mortality and growth rate of COVID-19 in populations in Brazil where the levels of antibodies to dengue were higher.

Brazil has the world's 3rd highest total of COVID-19 infections with more than 4.4 million cases -- behind only the United States and India. In states such as Parana, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Minas Gerais, with a high incidence of dengue last year [2019] and early this year [2020], COVID-19 took much longer to reach a level of high community transmission compared to states such as Amapa, Maranhao, and Para that had fewer dengue cases.

The team found a similar relationship between dengue outbreaks and a slower spread of COVID-19 in other parts of Latin America, as well as Asia and islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans.

Nicolelis said his team came across the dengue discovery by accident, during a study focused on how COVID-19 had spread through Brazil, in which they found that highways played a major role in the distribution of cases across the country. After identifying certain case-free spots on the map, the team went in search of possible explanations. A breakthrough came when the team compared the spread of dengue with that of the coronavirus. "It was a shock. It was a total accident," Nicolelis said. "In science, that happens, you're shooting at one thing and you hit a target that you never imagined you would hit."

"Abstract
---------
Although its international airports served as the country's main entry points for SARS-CoV-2, the factors driving the uneven geographic spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Brazil remain largely unknown. Here we show that 4 major factors likely accounted for the entire dynamics of COVID-19 in Brazil. Mathematical modeling revealed that, initially, the "super-spreading" city of Sao Paulo accounted for roughly 80% of the case spread in the entire country. During the 1st 3 months of the epidemic, by adding only 16 other spreading cities, we accounted for 98-99% of the cases reported in Brazil at the time. Moreover, 26 of the major Brazilian federal highways accounted for about 30% of SARS-CoV-2's case spread.

As cases accumulated rapidly in the Brazilian countryside, the distribution of COVID-19 deaths began to correlate with a 3rd parameter: the geographic distribution of the country's hospital intensive care unit (ICU) beds, which is highly skewed towards state capitals where the epidemic began. That meant that severely ill patients living in the countryside had to be transported to state capitals to access ICU beds where they often died, creating a "boomerang effect" that contributed to the skew of the geographic distribution of COVID-19 deaths.

Finally, we discovered that the geographic distribution of dengue fever, amounting to more than 3.5 million cases from January 2019 to July 2020, was highly complementary to that of COVID-19. This was confirmed by the identification of significant negative correlations between COVID-19's incidence, infection growth rate, and mortality to the percentage of people with antibody (IgM) levels for dengue fever in each of the country's states.

No such correlations were observed when IgM data for chikungunya virus, which is transmitted by the same mosquito vector as dengue, was used. Thus, states in which a large fraction of the population had contracted dengue fever in 2019-2020 reported lower COVID-19 cases and deaths, and took longer to reach exponential community transmission, due to slower SARS-CoV-2 infection growth rates.

This inverse correlation between COVID-19 and dengue fever was further observed in a sample of countries around Asia and Latin America, as well as in islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans.

This striking finding raises the intriguing possibility of an immunological cross-reactivity between DENV serotypes and SARS-CoV-2. If proven correct, this hypothesis could mean that dengue infection or immunization with an efficacious and safe dengue vaccine could produce some level of immunological protection for SARS-CoV-2, before a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 becomes available."

It's an intriguing analysis and conclusion. Definitely needs further study to identify possible confounding variables, and to do similar analyses in other countries with similar settings. - Mod.MPP]

- 10:52 -- Canada
As Canada faces a 2nd wave of COVID-19, authorities in the hardest-hit province of Quebec have been explaining how it is taking a different form. The virus is spreading in regions outside the former epicentre of Montreal, reports the Globe and Mail, and it is spreading mainly in the community, rather than in long-term care homes. Like other countries, the spread is also more among young adults, not the elderly. The new dynamic is leaving parts of the province newly on edge, the newspaper adds. For example, it reports that the "sleepy" Baie-des-Chaleurs health region in far eastern Quebec has one of the highest infection rates in the province.

- 10:20 -- UK
One of the British government's scientific advisers has said repeated "mini lockdowns" could be effective as a tool to bring COVID-19 cases under control. The suggestion from Professor John Edmunds, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), comes amid growing evidence the virus's prevalence is growing among older, more vulnerable people. He told the Observer: "A circuit breaker, or mini-lockdown can be used to reset the clock. The idea would be to bring the incidence back to what it was a few weeks earlier. You replace 2 weeks of exponential growth with 2 weeks of a decline in cases. This can have a big effect on the total number of cases, particularly if it is implemented shortly after the epidemic starts to grow."

A reporting team at the Observer have put together a longer read meanwhile on how Britain finds itself in a situation where infections are starting to dramatically rise again at a time when other nations have managed to stabilise or suppress the spread of the virus. But they also note that scientists are still arguing over the reasons some countries seem to have been spared heavy death tolls even as the infection spreads. A relatively young population may be less vulnerable than in fast-ageing western disease hotspots. People living in overcrowded conditions may have stronger immune systems, fortified by fighting off many past infections. But if it is hard to predict how COVID epidemics will develop, it is much easier to see what keeps the disease at bay. The few countries that have managed to effectively eliminate coronavirus range from authoritarian China to liberal democracies such as Taiwan and New Zealand.

- 09:57 -- Morocco
The situation in Morocco will worsen over winter as the flu season overlaps, according to the director of epidemiology at the Health Ministry, who said many hospitals and test sites for COVID-19 are expected to reach capacity. Mohamed Lyoubi, added during a webinar that the situation will also affect the ability of health authorities to carry out case investigations and ensure contact follow-up and monitoring of patients treated at home. Morocco's testing program is increasingly overwhelmed, reports the Associated Press. With air and sea borders closed for months and 8 cities barring people from entering or leaving, the news agency reports that authorities have been pulling out the stops to stanch the spread of coronavirus.

Marrakech, a major tourist destination, is at a standstill, while police checks are part of the scenery in hard-hit Casablanca, the country's economic powerhouse. In the northern city of Tangiers, military vehicles were deployed last month [August 2020] to help enforce measures there. Movement between the city and others was stopped, as it was in Casablanca, barring exceptional authorizations.

- 09:47 -- UK
The British government wants university students to be able to return home for Christmas, a minister has said, as a focus builds up on the plight of thousands of students who are already isolating amid COVID-19 outbreaks. "I very much want students to be able to go home at Christmas," Culture Minister Oliver Dowden told Sky News. The opposition Labour Party has called for the start of university term to be delayed while an "effective, efficient testing system" is put in place. The UK's daily coronavirus death toll will rise from 34 to 100 a day in 3 to 4 weeks' time, an expert on the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) warned on Saturday [26 Sep 2020].

[Journalists] Eve Livingston and Donna Ferguson have meanwhile filed this piece on the misery of 'lockdown freshers' in Scotland.

"Physically I feel tired and drained, I've got a sore throat and I can't taste," they were told by [TL], 19, who moved to Glasgow 2 weeks ago from the English city of York. "Emotionally it's miserable; you can't meet new people, you can't go to campus, you can't go home. It feels like you've come all this way to start a new life and you've ended up locked in a house for 2 weeks."

- 09:37 -- France
In France, where a doctors' leader has warned that the latest wave of the pandemic could "overwhelm" the country amid exhaustion on the part of health workers, Le Monde reports that 1/3 of the new clusters are in schools and universities. The latest figures from health officials indicate that 32% of the 899 clusters under investigation concern schools and universities. Patrick Bouet, head of the National Council of the Order of Doctors, meanwhile told the weekly Journal du Dimanche: ""The 2nd wave is arriving faster than we thought." Fresh restrictions to slow the spread of the disease in the country's worst-hit areas, including the Mediterranean city of Marseille and the Paris region, have run into local resistance. Bouet told the paper that warnings delivered this week by Health Minister Olivier Veran had not gone far enough.

- 09:22 -- Indonesia
Indonesia reported 3874 new coronavirus infections on Sunday [27 Sep 2020], bringing the total number of cases to 275 213, official data from the COVID-19 task force showed. The southeast Asian country also reported 78 new deaths, bringing the total number of fatalities to 10 386. A total of 3611 people recovered from the virus on Sunday, the data showed, bringing the total number of recoveries to 203 014.

- 09:02 -- Russia
Russia's daily tally of new coronavirus cases hit its highest level since [20 Jun 2020] on Sunday [27 Sep 2020] at 7867, bringing its total to 1 151 438, the country's coronavirus task force reported. In Moscow alone, there were 2016 new cases, exceeding the 2000 mark for the 1st time since [2 Jun 2020]. There were 99 deaths, taking Russia's official coronavirus death toll to 20 324.

- 09:01 -- UK
Anti lockdown activists in the UK today are reeling today after police broke up a protest in central London when thousands of people defied their advice and demonstrated against restrictions, mass vaccinations, mandatory wearing of face masks, and other coronavirus rules. 16 arrests were made, according to the police, who also say that and 9 officers were injured. Groups behind the protest, who also plan a 'family picnic' a noon in London's Hyde Park, have meanwhile been accusing the force of heavy handedness and signposting followers to lawyers and complaints lines. The tensions comes as Britain, or perhaps England in particular, has reached a crossroads, reports Robin McKie and Toby Helm in the Observer, who have been looking at an increasingly heated debate over whether to readopt stringent measures or return to 'the business of living.' On one side there are the 'lockdowners'. They think the only hope of triumphing over COVID-19 is shutdowns to bring numbers of cases back under control. Pubs and restaurants may have to close and households once again may be told not to mix. On the other are the 'libertarians'. They say we cannot return to those days because it would trigger an economic collapse and allow thousands of untreated cases of cancer, heart ailments and other diseases to mount. Tens of thousands might die, they say.

- 08:40 -- Czech Republic
The Czech Republic reported 1985 new cases of coronavirus on Saturday [26 Sep 2020] and 9 related deaths, health ministry data showed. That was roughly 1/3 lower than Friday's [25 Sep 2020] infection count, but fewer tests are done on weekends, according to Reuters. The country reported 2044 cases the Saturday [19 Sep 2020] before. The figures brought the total number of cases to 63 294 and deaths to 591 in the country of 10.7 million people. The number of people in hospitals rose to 809 from 740 as of Friday [25 Sep 2020], the latest data available.

- 08:15 -- USA (New York City)
New Yorkers are looking forward this weekend [26-27 Sun 2020] to the prospect of eating inside a restaurant for the 1st time in 6 months as the city plans to allow for interior dining from Wednesday [30 Sep 2020]. Restaurants can seat customers inside at 25% capacity, the latest relaxation in the quarantine rules imposed on New York after the coronavirus struck. Owners who spoke to the Guardian described it as a make-or-break moment heading into the winter.

- 08:04 -- Australia, Mainland China, Mexico, India, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Argentina, France
The Australian state of Victoria has announced an end to its curfew and easing of some of the months-long lockdown measures. The government also announced further steps out of lockdown will be based on case numbers, not strict dates. Australia reported just 18 new cases on Saturday [26 Sep 2020], and 2 deaths, and trade minister Simon Birmingham hopes a travel bubble with New Zealand can be put in place by the end of the year [2020].

Mainland China reported 15 new cases on Saturday [26 Sep 2020], all of them imported infections related to travellers.

Mexican authorities reported 5573 new cases along with 399 deaths on Friday [25 Sep 2020], but the true figures are likely significantly higher due to little testing.

India recorded 88 600 new cases of coronavirus on Sunday, taking the country's official toll to just under 6 million (5 992 532), according to the country's official figures. Deaths increased by 1124 to 94 503.

Coronavirus cases in Colombia, which is nearly a month into a national reopening after a long lockdown, surpassed 800 000.

Saudi Arabia plans to resume tourist visas by early 2021 after months of suspension amid strict measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

A Brazilian judge called off Palmeiras and Flamengo's league match due to be played on Sunday [27 Sep 2020] after at least 16 players from the club as well as the team's coach tested positive for COVID-19.

Argentina's coronavirus cases are poised to top 700 000 as new daily infections and deaths hit the top 5 globally, despite 7 months of lockdown that have ravaged the frail economy.

France registered another 14 412 confirmed coronavirus cases, not far from a daily record of 16 096 set earlier this week, total the tally to 527 446.

[Interpretations of today and tomorrow's data need to be cautioned with weekend artifact. Countries not reporting cases to WHO in the past 24 hours include Spain, Sweden, Costa Rica, and Switzerland. The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India now in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (82 767), followed by the USA (33 782) and Brazil (14 194) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.4%) and 52.3% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. As the daily reports from each of the 3 countries have been dropping, other countries are reporting more newly confirmed cases. A global total of 3667 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (26-27 Sep 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Spain (0), France (11 123), Argentina (8841), Russia (7867), Colombia (7018), UK (5692), and Peru (5160); 33 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. 7 of the top 20 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the European region and 7 were from the Americas region (unchanged from yesterday [25 Sep 2020]).

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 1.4%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 1.6%.

Impression: While the global 7-day averages appear to have plateaued, when one looks at the country-by-country figures, the 3 major countries -- the USA, India and Brazil -- have decreased their daily newly confirmed cases, but other countries have increased transmission, especially in Europe and the Americas. - Mod.MPP]
