Whooping cough at a primary school in Leicestershire
----------------------------------------------------
A primary school in Leicestershire [in the East Midlands of England. -
Mod.SH] has reported an outbreak of whooping cough. The disease has been
contracted by 23 pupils at Stathern School in the Vale of Belvoir. Several
other children also have the early symptoms of infection. All the pupils
and staff at the school are being given antimicrobials and a full
immunization program is being carried out.
The outbreak first came to light last week and officials from
Leicestershire Health Authority were sent in to investigate. Dr Philip
Monk, consultant in communicable disease control, said: "Within the school
there are currently a total of 23 confirmed and probable cases of whooping
cough. In addition a number of children have early symptoms which are
suggestive of the disease."
"We visited the school last Thursday (23 May 2002) to carry out tests and
gave all the children and teachers antimicrobial treatment to control the
spread of the disease. In addition, all the children at Stathern Primary
School have been given a booster vaccination against whooping cough to
further protect them."
Authorities also report that the entire school is being cultured for
_Bordetella pertussis_.

[Reports of clusters of pertussis continue to occur in various parts of the
developed world. The age of the affected students is not stated but,
assuming adherence to standard immunization protocols [94 per cent of
children aged 2 years in England and Wales have received three doses of
pertussis vaccine. -Mod.SH], it is likely that the cluster is related to
waning immunity from primary immunization. No mention is made of cases in
adults with household contact to the students either as a primary or
secondary case. Immunization of contacts with the acellular pertussis
vaccine should be effective in this outbreak, but it is likely that
clusters such as this one will continue until boosters of the vaccine are
not in short supply and given routinely every 10 years with adult Td toxoid
vaccine. - Mod.LL]
