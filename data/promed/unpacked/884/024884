A 26-year-old Taylor County man has died of rabies at the Medical Center of
Central Georgia in Macon, state officials reported. The man died Tuesday,
said the Department of Human Resources Division (DHR) of Public Health.
DHR officials believe the man was infected by bats living in the boarding
house where he was staying. The owner of the house has been notified and
efforts to destroy the bats are under way. The DHR did not release where
the victim was living. The last case of someone dying from rabies in
Georgia was in 1991 in Walker County, the DHR said. There have been 3
fatalities from rabies in the United States this year, officials said.
