More cases of mosquitoborne viruses have been detected in the [Western
Australia/WA] state's Kimberley and Pilbara regions more than 2 months
after 3 people were killed by the virus in 3 Australian states.

Murray Valley encephalitis [MVE] was continuing to be detected across
the state which medical entomologist Sue Harrington said was unusual
given it was so far into the dry season. She said it indicated an
"ongoing and persistent activity of the virus".

One person has died in WA and a further 9 people have been found to
have contracted the mosquitoborne virus this year [2011]. Another
person was currently being monitored and was believed to be the 11th
person with MVE [virus infection].

"Murray Valley encephalitis is carried by mosquitoes, and while the
risk of being infected and becoming unwell is low, the illnesses can
be severe and people should take sensible precautions to avoid
mosquito bites," she said. She said monitoring results, undertaken in
conjunction with the University of WA, found that although mosquito
numbers were quite low, the rare but potentially fatal virus was still
being detected.

A man died in the north west region of WA in early May [2011] after
contracting the virus. Later that month, it also claimed the life of a
Canadian tourist who visited the Northern Territory and a South
Australian man.

By late May 2011, the Department of Health had issued warnings that
the virus may spread much closer to Perth than it had previously, with
mosquitoes thriving in the perfect WA conditions. A late onset of
winter has allowed the infected mosquitoes to breed for longer and in
higher numbers, and they are thriving further south.

MVE has no cure and no vaccine with the only way to avoid infection
being the avoiding of mosquito bites. The Department of Health issued
a warning (http://www.health.wa.gov.au/press/view_press.cfm?id=1030)
to people living and travelling through the Kimberley and Pilbara
regions to take care against mosquitoes, especially at sunrise and
sunset when they were most active.

[The unusually wet weather in much of Australia this year (2011) has
created extensive breeding sites for vector mosquitoes. Now the late
onset of cooler weather has extended the MVE virus transmission
season. As Australian health authorities had predicted, these
conditions have resulted in an increase in arthropodborne virus
infections, including Murray Valley encephalitis, as noted above.
