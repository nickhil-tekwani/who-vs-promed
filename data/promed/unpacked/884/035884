An outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) has been recorded among wild
boars in Chechnya [Chechen Republic. - Mod.NP] The dead animals were
found close to the border with Georgia, informed Alexey Alexeenko,
the spokesman for Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Veterinary and
Phytosanitary Supervision Service of Russia. - Mod.NP]

"The discovery of the pack of dead boars was due to monitoring in the
district of Chechnya, bordering Georgia," said Alexeenko, as cited by
ITAR-TASS. Investigation of samples from the dead animals revealed
the ASF virus.

According to Alexeenko, no additional cases have been detected so far
among other wild boars or domestic pigs. "The Veterinary Service of
Chechnya, supported by the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Home
Affairs, and the Federal Security Service is planning measures to
prevent the disease becoming endemic in Chechnya's wildlife," he said.

Generally, Rosselkhoznadzor specialists are conducting active
monitoring of the situation in the Northern Caucasus. Earlier, mass
outbreaks of ASF had been recorded in Georgia; the disease spread in
Abkhazia, Southern Osetia, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabagh.
