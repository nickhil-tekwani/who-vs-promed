More than 3 years ago, members of the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company noticed unusual lesions on the legs of one of the shaggy, stocky wild ponies having made this barrier island a year-round tourist destination.

The bright coral wound was treated and it seemed to be healing, but in a little over a week the mare became too weak to stand and had to be euthanised.

Another 7 ponies followed in the coming years -- the majority during the very wet 2018 -- all succumbing to a deadly disease called swamp cancer.

Spread by a fungus-like microorganism living in stagnant water such as swamps, ponds, and lakes, swamp cancer has been found worldwide. It frequently infects horses and dogs and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions.

_Pythium insidiosum_ was first documented in the United States (US) in Texas and Florida about 60 years ago (under a different name). Scientists are still learning about how it spreads and infects. But one thing scientists do know is with a warming climate, it is moving north -- including to the island of Assateague, where the wild ponies live.

"Preliminary results show it's fairly ubiquitous across the refuge," said Nancy Finley, refuge manager.

Even so, there may be some good news this year [2020].

Facing a threat to the herd of about 160 ponies and foals, the fire department, which owns the animals, last year [2019] turned to an experimental 3-phase vaccine to inoculate the animals.

And while it is too early to declare victory, officials say the treatment may have paid off. During the recent annual spring pony roundup for health checks on [18 Apr 2020], all 148 ponies and 12 foals showed no sign of the disease, said Charles Cameron, the veterinarian who treated the ponies for 30 years and still helps during the check-ups.

Richard Hansen, the research veterinarian whose small Oklahoma-based company created the vaccine, is "cautiously optimistic" the vaccine is working.

The Chincoteague refuge sits within Assateague Island National Seashore, a 37-mile-long [59.5 km] barrier island running from Ocean City, Maryland, south to about 6 miles [about 10 km] beyond the town of Chincoteague, Virginia.

There are woodlands, marshes, and miles of pristine beach and dunes bringing wildlife and tourists -- especially each July when the ponies are herded across the channel between Assateague and Chincoteague islands and the foals are auctioned off to support the fire department and keep the herd size at about 150 ponies. Puddles of fresh water attract migratory species of birds can get as hot as 100 deg F [about 38 deg C] during the summer.

That's a perfect environment for equine pythiosis, said Erica Goss, a scientist from the University of Florida, who specializes in plant pathogens, or oomycetes, such as this one.

Last year [2019], with the pony swim as a backdrop, Goss, refuge wildlife biologist Kevin Holcomb, and Gustav Machado, a scientist from North Carolina State University, began taking water samples throughout the refuge.

Machado is using the data to help map the spread of the organism at the refuge. Goss took water samples using horse hair as bait to confirm the presence of _Pythium_.

On the Maryland side of Assateague, the National Park Service maintains a herd of 73 ponies but that group has not had any swamp cancer cases. Fresh water on that side is often mixed with ocean water, said Allison Turner, a biological technician there. But she said they don't know why their ponies haven't gotten the disease.

Goss is also investigating the tolerance of the microorganism to salt water. She said there's a possibility _Pythium_ might not release its infectious spores in salt water. She and her colleagues are hoping to find out whether salt water actually kills the microorganism, but their research has been interrupted by COVID-19 precautions that shut down their universities and travel plans.

"It's a really unusual organism. They swim around and look like they should be animals," Hansen said. "_Pythium_ is a disease of plants, too. This organism is similar to the organism that caused the potato blight in Ireland in the 1800s." In the environment, he said, they form a spore with a glue-like substance that adheres to the damaged parts of a plant or, in the case of horses, a wound or insect bite. Like a science-fiction monster, the organism shoots in a tube, which creates fingerlike projections inside the tissue, then eats its way through the tissue. "The way that these fingerlike projections move around in the tissue is they secrete an enzyme that helps clear the path for them to grow," he said. Once a horse is infected, masses caused by the disease spread quickly on the legs and abdomen, eventually disabling the animal. Hansen said one way the disease can spread into the environment is when ponies move around and the masses shed.

Last year [2019], Hansen was given permission by the Food and Drug Administration for compassionate use of his vaccine treatments for 3 human patients diagnosed with swamp cancer in Texas, Illinois, and Georgia. Human infection is considered rare; all 3 had preexisting health conditions. Hansen said the hospitals arranged the emergency FDA approvals. 2 of the 3 patients were cured, he said, but the 3rd "succumbed to leukemia, a condition she had when also diagnosed with swamp cancer."

With positive results from the spring health check, the fire department is now making plans for the July [2020] pony swim and auction. "Knock on wood, counting our blessings, so far it seems to be doing really well," fire department spokeswoman Denise Bowden said. It may be a much quieter pony swim this year, however.

Given the novel coronavirus [COVID-19], it is unclear how many tourists will make it. This month's [April 2020] pony roundup and health check normally would have attracted many tourists, as well. But with a nod from the fire department, the refuge closed the event to tourists as part of the effort to stop the spread of COVID-19.

[To understand why the Chincoteague ponies have a special name and garner so much attention, I have included some history for those unfamiliar with the situation. Then the distressing condition will be addressed and then back to some interesting history (https://chincoteague.com/pony_swim_guide.html):

"The Chincoteague Pony became an official registered breed in 1994. The average height of a Chincoteague pony is between 12 and 13 hands (any horse that stands less than 14 hands is considered a pony). Chincoteague ponies are stocky, with short legs, thick manes, and large, round bellies [a photo of wild ponies at Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge can be seen at the source URL above].

"Assateague Island is a harsh environment for the ponies and their diet is limited. The ponies have adapted to the limited diet over the hundreds of years they have lived on Assateague (the barrier island for Virginia and Maryland). The ponies primarily eat the salt water cord grass growing in the marshes on Assateague Island. They eat almost all day just to get enough nutrition from this diet to sustain themselves. The salt content of the cord grass is very high. To compensate for all the salt in the cord grass, they drink twice as much water as a normal horse. This is why their bellies appear so bloated."

These historical ponies with ties to the modern world are affected by a rather nasty organism. Pythiosis caused by the organism _Pythium insidiosum_ is a distressing and troublesome condition. It does appear as a growth with looks painful and nasty (photos may be seen at: https://www.horsetalk.co.nz/2015/07/17/effective-treatment-strategy-swamp-cancer-described/).

While a number of treatments have been tried and had limited success, there appears to be treatment out of Texas. It may be a type of vaccine, according to the information at https://www.victoriaadvocate.com/news/local/pythiosis-in-horses---swamp-cancer/article_b564b962-a65c-11e8-934c-4b882cdd7a43.html: "A vaccination is now available and is given in a series of 3 injections on day 1, day 7 and day 21. Studies show good results with the vaccine alone. Anti-fungal medications have been used in the past for treatment; however, there has been varied success. Early detection is key, since the smaller the lesion the easier it is to remove it. This is also the case for treatment with the vaccine. If the vaccine is started within the 1st 14 days, the success of treatment is significantly higher."

So, this year (2020), the vaccine from Texas seems to be working and there is cautious optimism. As noted above in the article, thus far, none of the ponies have any lesions.

The other treatment (other than vaccine) appears to be a combination of excision of excessive tissue caused by the causative agent and a combination of drugs. Healing of pythiosis lesions treated according to this particular regimen may be viewed at https://www.horsetalk.co.nz/2015/07/17/effective-treatment-strategy-swamp-cancer-described/. "Each horse was given a single intravenous dose with amphotericin B and dimethylsulfoxide in the affected tissue after the excess tissue was surgically removed." (This is not being used in 2020 as the Texas vaccine noted above is being used with cautious optimism)

A bit more history regarding these ponies (https://chincoteague.com/ponies.html):
"Two herds of wild horses make their home on Assateague Island (barrier islands) off the coast of Maryland and Virginia, separated by a fence at the Maryland-Virginia line. These small but sturdy, shaggy horses have adapted to their environment over the years by eating dune and marsh grasses and drinking fresh water from ponds. While they appear tame, they are wild, and Park Rangers urge visitors not to feed or pet them. The Maryland herd is managed by the National Park Service. The Virginia herd is owned by the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company. Each year the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company purchases a grazing permit from the National Fish & Wildlife Service. This permit allows the Fire Company to maintain a herd of approximately 150 adult ponies on Assateague Island. The Fire Company controls the herd size with a pony auction on the last Thursday in July. Each year tens of thousands of spectators come to watch the Saltwater Cowboys swim the pony herd from Assateague Island to Chincoteague Island."

"Wild ponies have inhabited Assateague Island for hundreds of years. Some have suggested the wild ponies of Assateague trace their origin to horses released to forage on the Island by early settlers. However, the evidence strongly suggests they are the descendants of the survivors of a Spanish galleon which wrecked off the coast of Assateague. This story, which has been passed from generation to generation on Chincoteague Island, is stronger than fiction.

"If you've ever seen a shipwreck map of the mid Atlantic coastline, then you know that there were a remarkable number of shipwrecks. Before modern navigation, ships used lighthouses and the stars to navigate at night. This worked well until a bad storm came up or heavy fog set in, which impaired visibility. This caused ships to get off course and hit sandbars along the coast. This would usually occur during a storm and the large waves would beat the wooden ship apart. The large number of shipwrecks, together with the fact that it was very common for ships to be transporting ponies to the Colonies or South America, makes it very likely that ponies originally got to Assateague from a shipwreck.

"Penning began as a way for livestock owners to claim, brand, break, and harness their loose herds. By the 1700's it had become an annual event, complete with drinking, eating, and plenty of revelry by the entire community. The earliest known description of Pony Penning was published in 1835. The practice was then already an "ancient" custom held in June on Assateague Island. Penning on Chincoteague Island is not mentioned until the mid-1800's, and is believed to have been begun by 2 islanders who owned large herds that grazed on Chincoteague.

"After a string of disastrous fires in the Town of Chincoteague, the villagers realized their fire-fighting equipment was seriously inadequate. In 1925 the town authorized the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company to hold a carnival during Pony Penning to raise funds. That year over 15 colts were sold to benefit the fire company, and the carnival was a huge success. Bolstered by the interest in the pony swim, visitors began arriving from across the country for the annual penning. The crowd in 1937 was estimated at 25 000. The increased revenue from the carnivals and auctions enabled the fire company to modernize its equipment and facilities, and in 1947 it began to build its own herd by purchasing ponies from local owners. They moved the herd to Assateague where the government allowed publicly owned, not private, herds to graze on the newly established Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge.

"That same year, 1947, Marguerite Henry published Misty of Chincoteague, the story that made Pony Penning internationally famous. A movie followed, as did several sequel books. The tale of the wild pony Phantom, her foal Misty and the children who buy and raise her has become a classic, still loved and enjoyed by each new generation.

"Pony Penning is still held in July during the Chincoteague Volunteer Firemen's Carnival. "Salt Water Cowboys" herd the horses across the narrowest part of Assateague Channel at low tide, after which they are examined by veterinarians. After a resting period, they are herded through town to a corral at the Carnival Grounds where they stay until the next day's auction. The Pony Auction not only provides a source of revenue for the fire company, but it also serves to trim the herd's numbers. To retain the permit to graze on the refuge, the herd must not exceed 150 horses.

"Each year thousands of people flock to Chincoteague Island to watch the Pony Penning and enjoy the Firemen's Carnival. For many of them, the trek to the shores of Assateague Channel on the last Wednesday and Thursday of July has become an annual event, an opportunity to participate in a tradition older than the country itself. More information about the annual Pony Swim is available at https://chincoteague.com/pony_swim_guide.html."

It was announced on 18 May 2020, the pony swim and auction has been cancelled due to COVID-19 and the desire to not have people crowding together. Likewise, the auction and carnival scheduled for July 2020 have also been cancelled. This is the 1st time since World War II this has happened (https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/chincoteague-pony-swim-canceled-for-first-time-since-wwii/2020/05/18/5e570506-9946-11ea-ad79-eef7cd734641_story.html).
