Avian influenza A (H5N1) Virus - WHO Update 14
-----------------------------------------------
Viet Nam: 2 Additional Laboratory-confirmed Human Cases of H5N1 Infection
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laboratory tests have confirmed an additional 2 cases of human infection
with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus in Viet Nam. Both have died. The 2
deaths announced today were in sisters, aged 23 and 30 years. Both women
fell ill on 10 Jan 2004, were admitted to hospital on 13 Jan 2004, and died
on 23 Jan 2004.
The results from initial local testing of these 2 cases were inconclusive.
Today's official confirmation follows more extensive testing at a WHO
influenza reference laboratory in Hong Kong. Altogether, 10 cases of human
infection with H5N1 avian influenza have been confirmed in Viet Nam. Of
these 10 cases, 8 have died, one has recovered, and one remains in hospital.
Investigation of a family cluster
---------------------------------
The 2 sisters who died are part of a cluster of 4 cases of severe
respiratory illness in a family from Thai Binh province. The cluster
includes the 2 sisters, their brother, and his wife, who has fully
recovered. The brother was hospitalized in Hanoi with a severe respiratory
illness on 7 Jan 2004 and died on 12 Jan 2004. No samples were available
for testing.
A detailed investigation of this cluster has been undertaken by WHO, Viet
Nam's National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, and local health
officials. To date, the investigation has not been able to conclusively
identify the source of infection for the 2 sisters. With the exception of
this family cluster, all human cases in the Viet Nam outbreak have been
linked to contact with infected poultry.
In Hong Kong in 1997, extensive studies, using both molecular and
epidemiological data, eventually linked all 18 cases of human H5N1
infection to contact with live infected poultry. In addition to these 18
cases, WHO notes that laboratory evidence indicated very limited
human-to-human transmission during the avian influenza A (H5N1) outbreak in
Hong Kong, and during a 2003 outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza
A (H7N7) virus infection in the Netherlands. However, no cases of severe
disease in humans occurred as a result of this very limited secondary
transmission.
In the current family cluster of cases in Viet Nam, WHO considers that
limited human-to-human transmission, from the brother to his sisters, is
one possible explanation. The investigation failed to reveal a specific
event, such as contact with infected poultry or an environmental source,
that might explain the source of infection in these cases. However, as
avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in poultry is widespread in Viet
Nam, direct transmission from poultry to humans cannot be entirely ruled
out on the basis of available evidence.
At present, no evidence indicates that efficient human-to-human
transmission is occurring in Viet Nam or elsewhere. WHO and health
authorities in Viet Nam and globally are continuing to assess the outbreak
in terms of its epidemiological evolution. Human cases are being
investigated to identify the source of infection, and evidence to date is
reassuring. WHO teams are supporting national investigations in Viet Nam
and Thailand, and will arrive soon in other countries that have requested
such support.

[These 2 additional laboratory-confirmed cases in Viet Nam bring the total
of confirmed human cases in East Asia to 13, 10 of whom have died. In
Thailand the number of cases remains 3, which includes 2 deaths. The family
cluster is the first report of human-to-human transmission during the
course of the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus outbreak in East Asia. At
present WHO is adopting a cautious interpretation in the absence of
information on the source of infection. - Mod.CP]
