Bluetongue alert in New Forest
------------------------------
The New Forest has been included in a new bluetongue protection zone
set up after a case of the animal disease was identified near Poole.
The new protection zone set up by the Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) covers the whole of Dorset and the New
Forest.

As a result of the case, which was identified during routine
pre-movement testing, the wider surveillance zone, which covers much
of England, has also been extended into south east Wales as well as
all of Somerset and Devon.

In Sussex, Essex, and Norfolk 3 new cases have also been identified,
which means the separate protection zones covering East Anglia and
parts of northwest London, Buckinghamshire, and Hertfordshire have
been merged and extended.

A Defra spokeswoman said all the infected animals were found as a
result of the testing that farmers must undertake before they are
able to move their livestock out of the zones.

The disease, which can be fatal to animals such as sheep and cows, is
spread by midges.

In December [2007] the Government announced "a vector-free period" in
which risk of the virus spreading was considered low because of a
lack of midge activity in the cold weather. The evidence suggests the
animals all had the disease before the vector-free period began,
making it unlikely the virus is currently circulating in the UK,
Defra said. The Defra spokeswoman said further similar cases may be
expected in the coming weeks. A case of the disease was identified
last week [8 Feb 2008] in Greater London.

The Environment Department is hoping to have a vaccine for the strain
of bluetongue currently affecting animals in Europe available by
early summer [2008] when the disease is expected to re-emerge.

Extension of bluetongue restricted zones
----------------------------------------
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) today
[Wed 13 Feb 2008] confirmed changes to the Bluetongue Protection and
Surveillance Zones, following confirmation of disease on premises
within the current zones.

In accordance with the UK Bluetongue Control Strategy and EU
legislation, a case in East Sussex requires Eastbourne District to
become part of the Protection Zone. A single case in Essex and
further assessment of cases found last week [4-10 Feb 2008], mean
that the 2 separate Protection Zones will now be merged between the
Districts of North Hertfordshire and Surrey Heath.

A further case identified near Poole, Dorset requires the
establishment of a new Protection Zone covering all of Dorset and the
New Forest. As a result, the Surveillance Zone now extends into all
of Somerset and Devon. The Welsh Assembly Government will declare the
necessary Restricted Zone in South East Wales.

The French authorities have reported a case of BTV 8 to the OIE
(World Organization for Animal Health), this time not as a result of
surveillance but because of clinical disease in a bovine animal on a
farm in Cubjac, Dordogne.

As it seems, sporadic "out of season" (the so-called "vector-free"
season) cases may still occur. The behaviour and, indeed, detailed
identity of the vectors -- particularly during the winter months --
is a subject in need of in-depth study. - Mod.AS]
