Influenza update no 202
-----------------------
Summary
-------
- In North America influenza activity has sharply increased over recent weeks. The predominant subtype of influenza viruses detected was A(H1N1)pdm09.
- In China influenza activity has been increasing with influenza (H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and influenza B circulating.
- For the rest of the northern hemisphere as well as in the southern hemisphere influenza activity remained low.
- In countries of tropical areas variable influenza activity was reported.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America
-------------
Influenza activity sharply increased in Canada, Mexico, and the USA and was primarily associated with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

In Canada consultation rates for influenza like illness (ILI), hospitalisations, as well as prescription rates for antivirals sharply increased in the last 2 weeks of 2013. During this season [2013-14] 17 influenza-associated deaths were reported and of these the majority (13) were associated with A(H1N1)pdm09.

In the USA, the proportion of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) was 4.3 percent, above the national baseline of 2.0 percent. All 10 regions reported ILI at or above region-specific baseline levels. However, the proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) for the last week of 2013 (week 52) was 6.5 percent which is below the epidemic threshold. 2 influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during week 52 (6 deaths have been reported this season).

In Canada and the USA a smaller proportion of hospitalizations and laboratory confirmed influenza cases were reported in adults older than 65 years of age this season compared to the 2012-13 season when A(H3N2) predominated.

In Mexico, the acute respiratory infection (ARI) and pneumonia rates continued to increase, however they remained within the expected levels for this time of year. Most of the increased ARI and pneumonia activity was reported in the northern states of the country.

Europe
------
Low levels of influenza activity continued although detections of influenza have been increasing. All 3 influenza subtypes (influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B) were detected but in low numbers. The number of hospitalizations due to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) remained low.

Northern Africa and the Western and Central Asia region
-------------------------------------------------------
Influenza activity was low in north Africa but increasing ILI activity was noted in Turkey, associated with increasing detections of A(H3N2) virus. Jordan also reported detections of A(H3N2).

Eastern Asia
------------
Influenza activity in eastern Asia continued to increase. In China influenza activity was high and increasing. Influenza A(H3N2) predominated in the south of China and A(H1N1)pdm09 and B in the north of China. While in the north of China ILI activity was in the range of the previous years, activity was slightly higher the south of China compared to the previous 3 seasons. In the Republic of Korea, ILI activity crossed the national threshold for seasonal activity with mainly influenza B virus being detected.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall influenza activity in the Caribbean, Central America, and tropical areas of South America was at low levels.

Central African tropical region
-------------------------------
In the African tropical region, influenza activity was reported from the central and western regions with detections of all 3 subtypes. Influenza A(H3N2) virus was detected in Madagascar.

Tropical Asia
-------------
Influenza activity in southern Asia was generally low with a decreasing trend. However, the Islamic Republic of Iran reported increasing influenza detections since mid-November [2013].

Influenza activity in South-East Asia varied among countries but overall was rather low. Influenza detections increased in Singapore, while the rate of acute respiratory infections was below the national threshold.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
In the southern hemisphere the season is over and all indicators are at interseasonal level.

[Due to technical problems presentation of this update has been delayed. Nonetheless without North America, the 2013-2014 influenza season is only beginning and the predominant viruses remain (H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and influenza B. The avian H7N9 influenza virus remains confined to Southern China and the number of avian H5N1 influenza virus infections remains low.
