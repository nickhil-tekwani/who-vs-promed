North Korea declares its bird flu outbreak over
---------------------------------------------
North Korea has confirmed that a bird flu outbreak that began in February
2005 had been stamped out, 3 months after a UN body declared the outbreak over.
The culling of 218 000 chickens and vaccination of 1.1 million poultry in
affected areas had ended the outbreak, a director of the North's Central
Anti-Epizootic Centre said in the July issue of a North Korean monthly
magazine.
"The bird flu has been fully eradicated in Chosun in a short period of time
due to national interest and aggressive action," scientist U Song-rim wrote
in the "Chosun", a copy of which was made available at the South's
Unification Ministry on Thursday [7 Jul 2005].
International organisations and South Korean agricultural agencies provided
medicine and technical expertise to help the reclusive, communist state
contain the outbreak.
The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said in April that North
Korea had contained the outbreak and that virus was not directly related to
a deadly strain which can jump from birds to humans.
The FAO said the bird flu outbreak in reclusive North Korea was caused by
an H7 strain of the virus, which causes severe disease in chickens but is
not directly related to the H5N1 strain circulating in other parts of Asia.
The North first reported the outbreak in March, saying it had taken place
at 2 bird farms in the capital Pyongyang.

[According to OIE's Code, the eradication of a notifiable disease is to be
officially confirmed in a final report of the affected member-country.
An avian-influenza outbreak was initially suspected in N. Korea on 15 Mar
2005 (20050315.0752), and, according to the authorities, could eventually
be officially announced in the country on 27 Mar 2005.
On 7-8 Apr 2005, the national authorities officially informed the OIE about
the diagnosed H7 outbreak. The notification added detailed information,
including the following statement: "Tests are currently under way to
determine the N subtype of the virus" (see 20050408.1016). The results of
the said tests, as well as the source/origin of the outbreak/infection, are
still pending. - Mod.AS]
