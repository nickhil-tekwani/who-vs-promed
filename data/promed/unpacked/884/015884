[The death of the Indonesian teenager from Central Java] takes the
human death toll from H5N1 avian influenza virus in Indonesia to 79,
the highest in the world. [To date,] there have been 99 human cases
of the disease in the Southeast Asian country.
Including the latest death, there have been 188 deaths globally and
310 known infections in total, according to data from the World
Health Organisation (WHO).
The most common way humans become infected with bird flu is through
contact with sick fowl. The disease is endemic in bird populations in
most parts of Indonesia, where millions of backyard fowl are kept in
close proximity to humans and where education campaigns often do not
reach the more remote areas.
For the moment, it remains largely a disease in birds, but scientists
are worried about the virus's persistence and ability to adapt to new
environments and hosts. Scientists say H5N1 is a global threat
because the virus could mutate into a form that passes easily between
people, triggering a pandemic in which millions could die.
