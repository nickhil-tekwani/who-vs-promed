[2] India (Karnataka state)

Intermittent rain in several parts of Dakshina Kannada [district in Karnataka] since June this year [2015] has led to a spurt in cases of dengue viral infection with patients rushing to government and private hospitals for treatment.

As many as 217 persons have tested positive for dengue, while there have been 965 suspected cases of viral infection this June [2015]. In June 2014, of the 63 persons suspected to have had viral infection, 11 were found to have been infected by dengue virus.

"Intermittent rain so far has been the cause for the spurt in such cases," District Health and Family Welfare Officer Ramakrishna Rao told reporters here on [Thu 2 Jul 2015]. He said that dengue virus is transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes that breed in fresh water collected on roof tops, on roads, fields, disposed cups, and tender coconuts.

Dr Rao said that 4 persons have been confirmed to have died of dengue this June [2015], while 3 deaths were suspected to be due to dengue. And, 2 died of the infection in 2014, he said.

Dr Rao said that treatment for dengue was symptomatic and was the same as in the case of any viral infection. "Early diagnosis, treatment, adequate hydration, and rest are the best ways to tackle it," he added. He said that instructions have been given to schools, colleges, hostels, and hotels to immediately refer people with fever for examination at government hospitals and health centres.

All premises should be kept free from water stagnation, he said, and added that fogging was being taken up on a regular basis, especially in places where cases of fever are being reported.

Kishore Kumar, a nodal officer overseeing fogging and other prevention measures in the district, said that arrangements have been made to ensure availability of platelets in 13 blood banks. Platelets extracted from whole blood can be stored for 5 days, he added.

Dr Kumar said that in the last one month [June 2015], 1200 units of platelets have been consumed in various cases, including dengue, in government and private hospitals.

Dr Rao said that a standard protocol has been issued to government and private hospitals for regular monitoring of platelet counts in patients suspected of having dengue. Platelet units were being provided free at the district hospitals, and arrangements are being made to supply them at taluk hospitals too.

[Dengue is a major public health problem in India. It is transmitted by the bite of the vector, the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, infected with one of the 4 dengue virus serotypes. It is endemic throughout India, mostly in the metropolitan cities and towns (http://www.nvbdcp.gov.in/dengue5.html).

As per the media report above, 217 confirmed dengue cases with 4 deaths were reported in Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka in June 2015, whereas in June 2014, 63 positive cases and 2 deaths were reported in the district. To prevent further spread of the disease, mosquito source reduction and community awareness regarding prevention and control of dengue are needed.

In 2014, Karnataka reported 3358 dengue cases including 2 deaths (http://www.nvbdcp.gov.in/den-cd.html).

The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme in India recommends the following preventive measures against dengue: removing water from coolers and other small containers at least once a week; using aerosol repellent during the daytime to prevent the bites of mosquitoes; avoiding clothes that expose arms and legs; not allowing children to play in shorts and half-sleeved clothes; and using mosquito nets or mosquito repellents while sleeping during the daytime, since the mosquito is a daytime biter (http://www.nvbdcp.gov.in/dengue12.html).

Preventing or reducing dengue virus transmission depends entirely on controlling the mosquito vectors or interruption of human-vector contact (http://www.who.int/denguecontrol/control_strategies/en/).

Dakshina Kannada is a coastal district in the state of Karnataka in India. Sheltered by the Western Ghats on the east and surrounded by the Arabian Sea on the west, Dakshina Kannada receives abundant rainfall during the monsoon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakshina_Kannada. - Mod.GS]
