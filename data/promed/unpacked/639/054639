Panic gripped the people of Bermo [Bokaro district] following reports
of cerebral malaria in the subdivision. Villages residing in the
Angawali, Central colony, Makoli, Phusro, and northern ravines of the
dense forest parallel to the Peterwar-Jainamore road are said to be
the worst affected.

The malaria control exercise of the health department is confined
merely to the distribution of anti-malaria medicine. The condition of
[several patients] is critical, sources added.

According to reports, in July [2010] several patients suffering from
malaria were admitted in CCL and DVC Hospital.

Dr Veni K of DVC Hospital, Bokaro thermal said that 2 or 3 patients
every day admitted to the DVC hospital for treatment are also
suffering from cerebral malaria.

Most of the patients brought from remote areas for treatment were
undiagnosed cases of cerebral malaria and were in advanced stage of
the disease. "The time factor for treatment of cerebral malaria is
most necessary. The sooner the treatment starts the better are the
chances of survival of patients," added Dr Veni K.

According to reports, 6 teams have been formed to fight out the
disease by the Health department; these teams are moving village to
village to identify the affected cases; however, in absence of ample
resources, including slides, the laboratory technicians have been
facing hardships.

The Medical Superintendent of district informed that all measures
were being taken to combat the disease in the Bermo area and
medicines have been distributed in large number.

The medical officer, however, advised the villagers to adopt
preventive measures and maintain cleanness and domestic precautions
to fight against the disease.

[Malaria is endemic in Jharkhand. A recent survey of malaria in
pregnant women (Hamer DH et al: Burden of malaria in pregnancy in
Jharkhand State, India. Malaria J 2009, 8: 210;
doi:10.1186/1475-2875-8-210; available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2744702/>) found that
1.8 percent (43/2382) had a positive diagnostic test for malaria
(53.5 percent _Plasmodium falciparum_, 37.2 percent _Plasmodium
vivax_, and 9.3 percent mixed infections). Among delivery unit
participants, 1.7 percent (12/717) had peripheral parasitaemia and
2.4 percent (17/712) had placental parasitaemia. One would expect
that a surge of cerebral malaria was followed by a surge in malaria
cases not presenting as cerebral malaria, but this is not mentioned
in the report. - Mod.EP]
