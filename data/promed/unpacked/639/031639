Typhoid death in Samoa prompts action
----------------------
The death of a one-year-old baby from a village in Upolu from typhoid has sparked the Red Cross Samoa into action.

The Red Cross conducted a hygienic assessment in Aele last week and is now supporting the villagers by providing them with soap and clothes to ensure the families are protected.

The group are also responding to several cases of typhoid in Malie, Upolu, with help from Rotary Samoa, Samoa Water Authority and other NGOs.

Nine members of one family in Malie had typhoid.

Two asylum seekers have been diagnosed with typhoid, putting Christmas Island staff and inmates under watch. The 2 men arrived on different boats over the past week.

One has been admitted to hospital on the mainland [Australia] while the other is in isolation on the island, an immigration department spokeswoman said yesterday, 27 Feb 2012.

She said staff and inmates who had come in contact with the pair were being monitored for signs of the disease, contracted by contaminated food or water and spread by bacteria. Despite other diseases being picked up over the past 20 months in asylum seekers, including syphilis, hepatitis B, and C and active tuberculosis, it is the 1st time typhoid has been diagnosed in some time.

A total of 25 vessels have arrived since December 2011 with 2068 people on board, smashing arrival records set in previous summers.

There has been a substantial decrease in typhoid cases at Koroboya Village and Naitasiri Village of Ba [Western division], says the Ministry of Health. Spokesman Peni Namotu said there had been no new cases of typhoid since the inception of the Public Health Emergency Regulation in February 2012.

So far, health teams have recorded and treated 15 cases of typhoid at the 2 villages. "We have noticed a great improvement of sanitary conditions at the villages," Mr Namotu said.

"Right now, our health officers are working on further improving their sanitary conditions and also change their mind-set about healthy living. Changing people's way of thinking is very important because when our teams move out, we want them to continue living in a clean environment," he said.
