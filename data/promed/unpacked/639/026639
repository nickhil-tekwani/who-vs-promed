Faribault Foods, Inc. is voluntarily recalling 15-ounce cans of S&W Organic Black Beans, 15-ounce cans of O Organic Brand Black Beans, and 15-ounce cans of O Organic Brand Chili Beans because the cans may have a compromised hermetic seal. The compromised hermetic seal may affect can integrity and may cause the cans to leak, bloat, or allow bacteria to grow inside the product, which could lead to serious illness.

Symptoms [of botulism] may include double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and muscle weakness. Botulism poisoning can cause paralysis of the breathing muscles, which can result in death unless assistance with breathing (mechanical ventilation) is provided.

The recalled products were distributed nationwide in retail stores.

This event only affects the lot codes listed below: The lot codes are printed on the bottom of the can.

No other production codes, sizes or brands of Faribault Foods, Inc. products are affected by this recall. Consumers who may have purchased the products listed above should return them to the store where they were purchased for a refund or replacement. The recall was initiated after the firm had received consumer and customer complaints regarding failure of the hermetic seal. The problem related to the hermetic seal failure was corrected, and no other product is affected.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
