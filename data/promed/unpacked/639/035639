[In the most recent issue of the Veterinary Microbiology journal, Aziz-Boaron O et al, at the Koret School of Veterinary Medicine, the Robert H. Smith Faculty of Agriculture, Food and Environment, the Hebrew University, Israel, published a study about the field effectiveness of the inactivated vaccines used to control bovine ephemeral fever (BEF). Below is the abstract. - Mod.SMA]

Abstract
--------
Bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) is an important viral disease of cattle. Despite the extensive use of inactivated vaccines for the prevention of BEF, a controlled study of their field effectiveness has never been performed. We conducted a large field effectiveness study of a BEF inactivated vaccine, during a large BEF outbreak. Neutralizing antibody titers measured in 385 heifers and calves 1 month after 2nd vaccination averaged 1:91.8 (CI [confidence interval] 95 percent=76.6-110). The effectiveness study enrolled 2780 cows in 9 herds. In 2 herds cows vaccinated twice, 1 year before the outbreak and once 2-3 months before outbreak onset were compared with non-vaccinated cows. Average vaccine effectiveness of 3 vaccine doses compared to no vaccination was 47 percent (CI 95 percent=34-57) in these herds. In 2 other herds cows vaccinated twice 1 year before the outbreak and twice again 2-3 months before outbreak were compared with cows vaccinated only twice 2-3 months prior to the outbreak. Average vaccine effectiveness of 4 doses compared to 2 doses was 49 percent (CI 95 percent=25-65) in these herds. In 5 herds cows vaccinated twice 2-3 months before outbreak onset were compared with non-vaccinated cows. This vaccination schedule was shown to be non-effective (average effectiveness=2 percent, CI 95 percent=-14-17). Milk production analysis on one of the effected herds, in which 56 percent vaccine effectiveness and an absolute reduction of 27 percent in morbidity were documented, revealed a net milk production loss of 175.9 kg/sick cow (CI 95 percent=127.9-223.9) and an average gain of 37 kg [81.6 lb] for each vaccinated cow (CI 95 percent=-3.6-77.7). This study indicates that despite the fact that 2 vaccine doses of the tested inactivated vaccine elicited high titers of neutralizing antibodies, partial protection was induced only when at least 3 doses were administrated before natural challenge.

[In chapter 5 of the paper ("Conclusions"), the authors stated: "The limited effectiveness of the presented inactivated vaccine may not be satisfactory at this point."

Consequently, Israel's Clinical Veterinary Service "Hachaklait," which caters for about 90 percent of the country's dairy cattle farms, opted for the application of an Australian live attenuated vaccine. The vaccination is voluntary.

The vaccine includes BEF virus strain '919' (field isolate Queensland 1978, passaged in calves and adapted to Vero cells in the Queensland University).

The freeze-dried live attenuated virus '919' is mixed with the adjuvant Quil A (a saponin derivative) immediately prior to application. According to the published data, this is an unusual vaccine: the live attenuated virus is inactivated by the said adjuvant (Ref 1).

According to the producer's leaflet, the primary vaccination is recommended from 6 months of age; 2 doses (2 ml each, subcutaneous) are required to produce long lasting (over 1 year) immunity, 2 weeks to 6 months between the 2. Following the primary vaccination (comprising of the 2 injected doses), booster vaccination is to be applied, from the 2nd year and onwards, once a year for all cattle.

Side effects (according to the producer's leaflet) are: a transient febrile response in animals may be observed. This response could contribute to a sudden drop in milk production.

The described Australian vaccine has undergone field trials, conducted in Australia between 1982 and 1984; they are described in Ref 1.

According to available unofficial information, results of vaccination with the Australian vaccine in Israel seem to be satisfactory; written records of the collected and analysed field observations will be helpful for all concerned within and beyond the region.

The chief veterinarian, "Hachaklait," is gratefully acknowledged for his immediate response and excellent information provided.
