Source: [From a very reliable and informed source outside Kuwait I have
received the following information on the situation in Kuwait. MHJ

FMD has moved from Iraq to Saudi and into Kuwait. Animal to animal
transmission is important, not aerosol transmission. There is a great deal
of nomadic movement across the Saudi-Kuwait border.
In the majority of FMD outbreaks investigated in Kuwait, clinical disease
was preceded by movement of sheep onto the farm. Many owners of the larger
dairy herds also have one or more small holdings elsewhere.
FMD is rife in Saudi Arabia.
Imports of livestock from Africa have been banned.
