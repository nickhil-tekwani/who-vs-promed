He has requested the posting of the following correction/clarification:
The hajj takes place in the 12th month of the Muslim calendar. This year
it will be 14-16 April. From then until 19 April there will be
celebrations. Saudi Arabia has a web site. Vaccinations are required for
entry.
[i.e. the hajj has nothing to do with Ramadan. For purists, the hajj also
involves a visit to Medina and other holy sites. The Saudis run a huge
public health operation each year to avoid epidemics. The vaccination
requirements for the hajj are published by WHO in the WER (Weekly
Epidemiological Record) every year in advance. Last year's requirements
may be found through the WHO website http://www.who.ch - Mod.JW]
