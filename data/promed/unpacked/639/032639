[1] Australia (Victoria, Melbourne): lockdown
Date: Wed 2 Jun 2021

The Australian state of Victoria will extend its lockdown by another week as authorities battle to control a growing virus outbreak. Officials say people have been catching the virus from "fleeting" encounters in a Melbourne outbreak of the B.1.617.1 strain, now named the Kappa variant by the World Health Organization.

Australia's second-most-populous state will now be locked down until 10 Jun [2021]. It's the 4th shutdown endured by residents so far in the pandemic. Six new local cases were reported on Wednesday [2 Jun 2021], taking the cluster to 60.

"I know this is not the news that everybody wants to hear, but given the cases we have... the government had no choice," said acting premier James Merlino. "If we don't do this [lockdown], this thing will get away. This variant of concern will become uncontrollable, and people will die."

Nearly 7 million people have been in lockdown since 27 May [2021], after the state recorded its first cases in the community in nearly 3 months. For another 7 days, people in the state capital Melbourne will be required to stay at home except for essential work, shopping, exercise, caregiving, or to get a COVID vaccine. No gatherings are allowed. Some measures have been eased including the expansion of travel limits to within 10 km (6.1 miles) of the home, and senior school students will be allowed to return to the classroom.

Outside the state capital, restrictions will be relaxed for regional towns with limited outdoor gatherings and the re-opening of restaurants. But Mr Merlino warned people to remain cautious. He said there are more than 350 places where people may have been exposed to the virus, including camping spots in the neighbouring state of New South Wales after a Melbourne resident travelled there. "No one -- no one -- wants to repeat last winter," he said, referencing Melbourne's 2nd wave last year [2020], which caused over 90% of deaths nationwide. The state endured a 112-day lockdown to bring the case rate back to zero.

Victoria's new outbreak has highlighted the low level of vaccination among Australians, a task that has been the responsibility of the federal government. Less than 2% of the population has been vaccinated. Cases reported in aged care homes in Melbourne this week have also fueled criticism of the flawed rollout. The government had pledged it would prioritise vaccines for vulnerable groups like the elderly but was forced to admit yesterday [Tue 1 Jun 2021] it did not know how many vaccinations had occurred in aged care homes amid reports of widespread delays.

The Victorian outbreak marks the biggest case increase in Australia since October [2020]. The nation has largely avoided the level of COVID deaths seen in many other developed nations due to a stringent system of snap lockdowns, border controls, and movement restrictions.

Officials say this outbreak has been traced to a traveller who tested positive days after finishing quarantine in South Australia. It's believed he contracted the virus through airborne transmission from an infected traveller in another room, throwing up questions over the safety of hotel quarantine.

[The transmission events being recorded in Australia are concerning because they suggest extremely high transmissibility, with individuals becoming infected though only casual contact.

Victoria's chief health officer Brett Sutton says people are becoming infected with COVID-19 in ways Australia has not seen before. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday [2 Jun 2021], where it was announced the state's 7-day lockdown would continue for another week, Professor Sutton said a person was infected at an indoor enclosed space "2 hours after an infectious case had left".

"[It] was therefore a substantial period of time, but they had left 2 hours before the next exposed individual came in who has become a case," he said. "That's in the kind of measles category of infectiousness. Probably relates to an unventilated setting where someone spent a great deal of time, but to come in 2 hours later and be infected." Sutton said there was another case where the virus had showed up "in places where normally it would be likely. So the Brighton Beach Hotel, that was an outdoor dining setting, well ventilated; you wouldn't expect transmission to occur," he said. "We still had it as an exposure site, we still informed people to test and isolate until returning a negative, but, in fact, all of those people will need to be in quarantine because transmission has occurred there. "That's not something that we routinely see, and we didn't routinely see it in 2020, but we have to bear in mind that all the variants of concern now are really a step up to some degree" (https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/covid-19-coronavirus-victoria-resident-infected-in-indoor-space-two-hours-after-positive-case-left/ZIL4Z7ZGZ7E5WAOMYC3UAW4S5M/).

At least 59 people have died of mucormycosis across hospitals in Delhi so far after the 2nd wave of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), said senior Delhi government officials on Monday [31 May 2021]. The number of deaths due to the aggressive infection, commonly known as black fungus, is higher than the recoveries so far: only 41 people who contracted the fungal infection in the national capital have recovered.

There were 748 black fungus patients undergoing treatment for the infection in Delhi as on Monday [31 May 2021], according to data received by the Delhi government from hospitals in the city.

"There are nearly 300 cases of black fungus in central government hospitals, and around 650 in Delhi government hospitals. However, the supply of injections to treat the infection is not adequate. We received 1000 injections 2 days ago (Saturday [29 May 2021]) but did not receive any on Sunday [30 May 2021]. It takes 3 or 4 injections per person per day to effectively treat the infection," Kejriwal said on Monday [31 May 2021]. The CM included patients who have been discharged or have died, officials later clarified.

Mucormycosis is a fungal infection that usually affects the mouth, nose, and eyes, and may then spread to the brain.

[2B] Cause

https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-covid-19-surge-is-related-to-a-black-fungus-outbreak


A surge in cases of mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, is affecting India, a country already experiencing a severe rise in COVID-19 cases. More than 9000 cases of the fungus have been reported, according to the Associated Press. And medication to treat it is running low.

This potentially fatal fungal infection is likely increasing due to the surge of people with COVID-19. Fighting the coronavirus can leave people's immune systems compromised or weakened, which means they may have a higher chance of developing mucormycosis. Healthline spoke with experts to better understand what might have caused India's worsening health emergency.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mucormycosis is caused by a group of molds called mucormycetes, which are found in soil and organic matter, like compost piles. The infection typically affects people with health problems (like COVID-19) or those who take medicines that can lower the immune system's ability to fight infection. It commonly affects the sinuses or lungs after the fungal spores are inhaled from the air.

"Mucormycosis is a fungal infection that tends to infect people who have suppressed immune systems, such as people with severe diabetes," Dr Eric Cioe-Pena, director of global health at Northwell Health in New York, told Healthline. "Once it infects you, it's very morbid and has a high mortality." Symptoms of sinus and brain mucormycosis include facial swelling, nasal congestion, and headache. If it makes it to the lungs, symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Depending on what part of the body is affected, mucormycosis can be fatal in up to 96% of cases.

Dr Kishorbhai Gangani, internist at Texas Health Arlington Memorial Hospital, explained that India was relatively lucky during the country's 1st wave of COVID-19, but that a combination of factors set the stage for the current surge in COVID-19 and mucormycosis cases. According to Gangani, elections and associated mass rallies were happening, and it was a time of year when many weddings happen; and crucially, there were no COVID-19 restrictions. "Government probably focused more on elections than on anything else," he said. "At that time, it was happening all over India, and the focus was shifted. It was bad timing."

Gangani explained that a typical Indian wedding can involve up to 1000 people, and that the country's infrastructure was never ready for a surge of this magnitude. "And the strain they have is very virulent, and they didn't expect that this was going to be a fast-transmitting strain and more virulent, which will make more people sicker, faster," he added. With so many people experiencing compromised immunity from COVID-19, a surge in mucormycosis became more likely. Gangani said the COVID-19 surge began at the start of the vaccine campaign, causing many to believe the vaccine was causing, rather than treating, the disease. "The 2nd wave started, and people, some people actually started thinking that they're getting infected because they got the vaccine," he said. "And then the rumors started spreading." Gangani even had a hard time convincing his own family of the truth. He said that he tried to correct this misinformation when speaking with his relatives there, but they didn't believe him.

"Statistical analysis has proven that steroid drugs are useful in reducing mortality (death rate) in COVID patients with low oxygen saturation levels," said Dr Donna Casey, internist at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. "Steroids reduce inflammation; however, they can negatively affect your ability to fight infection."

Gangani explained that if people aren't given the appropriate dosage of steroid drugs, they can have a higher chance for contracting another infection. "An important thing is using it wisely and timely, and that's where the trouble comes in, knowing when to use [steroid drugs] and how much to give," he said.

Also, people with other chronic conditions such as diabetes can be at higher risk for mucormycosis. "If they [COVID patients] have uncontrolled blood sugars to begin with, and if you use steroid on top of that, their blood sugar is going to be very uncontrolled," he said. "High blood sugar will lead to acidic blood, and this particular fungus, it actually thrives in high blood sugar and high acidic environments."

Dr Minh Nghi, an internist at Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Southwest in Fort Worth, Texas, pointed out that people living with diabetes and COVID-19 are at a disadvantage, "as they have both diabetes and also are likely to be given steroids as a treatment for COVID. Anyone with a suppressed immune system is at risk for mucormycosis," said Nghi. "This is an opportunistic fungal infection that is commonly seen in diabetes, steroid use, solid organ transplant patients, and anyone with a suppressed immune system."

According to Gangani, a shortage of oxygen tanks and delivery devices might have created another vector for mucormycosis contamination. "The biggest thing I have in my mind, why they are seeing so many mucormycosis cases is that in India there was severe shortage of oxygen," he said. "So they had to pull in from wherever they get either oxygen tanks or cylinders, and some of them were outdated, and who knows [if] those appliances or oxygen delivery systems were colonized [by the fungus]."

An epidemic of black fungus is sweeping India in the wake of a severe surge in COVID-19 cases. Experts said the cause is a combination of factors. These factors might include contaminated oxygen equipment and use of steroid drugs to treat certain COVID-19 patients. Experts also said that poor preparation for a 2nd wave of COVID-19, misinformation about vaccine effectiveness, and relaxed COVID-19 restrictions during a time of year filled with mass gatherings heavily contributed to the current health emergency.

[3] Kidney dialysis patients
Date: Wed 2 Jun 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/06/study-identifies-covid-risks-kidney-dialysis-patients


Among patients with kidney failure who underwent dialysis at clinics several times a week, the risk of COVID-19 infection was highest in those who were older, had diabetes, lived in communities with high coronavirus prevalence, and received dialysis at clinics serving more patients, finds a study yesterday in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology. Led by British researchers, the study also showed that COVID-19 infection risks were lowest among patients who received dialysis in clinics with more isolation rooms and mask policies for all patients, including those with no coronavirus symptoms.

The researchers mined electronic health record data on 5755 patients who underwent dialysis in 51 clinics at 7 kidney centers in London. Of the patients, 17% tested positive for COVID-19 from 2 Mar to 31 May 2020, and 8% were hospitalized with suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection. No link was observed between infection or hospitalization and sex, ethnicity, or socioeconomic indicators.

Risk factors for time to COVID-19 infection or hospitalization included advanced age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.01), diabetes (HR 1.20), and COVID-19 prevalence in patient home communities (HR 1.17). These factors were also associated with hospitalization on its own (HR: 1.02, 1.22, and 1.14, respectively).

Similarly, higher numbers of isolation rooms per station were tied to lower risk for COVID-19 infection but not hospitalization, and the authors suggested that the ability to isolate patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 helps prevent onward virus spread. Isolation strategies at different kidney centers weren't associated with likelihood of infection or hospitalization.

"These data suggest community levels of COVID-19, along with a small contribution of unit-factors and masking, determine how the infection burden evolves," the authors wrote. Patients were, on average, 63 years old, 39% were female, and 42% had diabetes. Of all dialysis patients, 35% were White, 29% were Black, and 22% were Asian.

The authors noted that dialysis patients who receive treatment in centers rather than at home face unique infection risks amid the pandemic. In addition to kidney disease, dialysis patients also have high rates of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and they include large proportions of Black and other at-risk minority racial groups and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.

In an American Society of Nephrology news release, lead study author Ben Caplin of University College London, said the study confirms that patients receiving dialysis at centers have high rates of COVID-19 and suggests that viral transmission occurs in dialysis units and communities. "The work also suggests that, in addition to isolation of confirmed cases, addressing factors that might reduce transmission from patients without suspected or confirmed disease might provide an additional opportunity to further modify the impact of COVID-19 in this population," Caplin said.

"Abstract:
Background. Patients receiving in-center hemodialysis treatment face unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically the need to attend for treatment that prevents self-isolation. Dialysis unit attributes and isolation strategies that might reduce dialysis center COVID-19 infection rates have not been previously examined.

"Methods. We explored the role of variables including community disease burden, dialysis unit attributes (size, layout), and infection control strategies on rates of COVID-19 among patients receiving in-center hemodialysis in London, UK, between 2 Mar and 31 May 2020. The 2 outcomes were defined as (i) a positive test for infection or admission with suspected COVID-19, and (ii) admission to the hospital with suspected infection. Associations were examined using a discrete-time multi-level time-to-event analysis.

"Results. Data on 5755 patients, dialysing in 51 units, were analysed. [Of these,] 990 (17%) tested positive, and 465 (8%) were admitted with suspected COVID-19 between 2 Mar and 31 May 2020. Outcomes were associated with age, diabetes, local community COVID-19 rates, and dialysis unit size. Greater number of available side rooms and introduction of mask policies for asymptomatic patients were inversely associated with outcomes. No association was seen with sex, ethnicity, or deprivation indices nor with any of the different isolation strategies.

"Conclusions. Rates of COVID-19 in the in center-hemodialysis population relate to individual factors, underlying community transmission, unit size and layout."

"This work confirms the large burden of COVID-19 experienced by the dialysis population and highlights the need to prioritise this vulnerable group in strategies aimed at reducing spread, protecting individuals, and/or treatment of established disease."
