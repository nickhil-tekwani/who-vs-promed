Canine influenza confirmed in the Poconos
------------------------------------------
More than 70 dogs have been infected by a confirmed new strain of dog
influenza at Trifecta Kennels in Gilbert, PA. As a precaution, the
Monroe County SPCA is under quarantine. No dogs will be taken until
tests determine the health of the current canine population at the SPCA.
"If we take in a sick dog and it spreads to the rest of the kennel,
we can't adopt out any dogs," Elaine Skypala, chief operating officer
for the Pennsylvania SPCA said. If your dog has been in a group
setting, look for these symptoms: a runny nose, low grade fever and a
cough. When caught early, an antibiotic treatment cures canine
influenza in about a week. Left untreated, the illness may progress
into a bacterial infection that can be deadly to dogs. So far, humans
have not been affected by the illness.
Canine influenza looks like kennel cough, but spreads more quickly.
In a group of 50 dogs, 5 might get kennel cough while 30 out of 50
could be infected with canine influenza in the same amount of time.
It was the rate of transfer, more than 70 affected dogs, that alerted
local vets to the outbreak at Trifecta Kennels.
Lisa Kane, who co-owns the kennel with Grace Mondrosch, said 3
veterinary clinics worked together to identify the illness, the
Brodheadsville Clinic, East Stroudsburg Vet Hospital and Homestead
Veterinary clinic. "Because of them this idea of influenza came up.
Otherwise we would have gone on thinking we had a weird strain of
kennel cough," Kane said. Samples from the dogs were confirmed by the
College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University.
Trifecta Kennels shut down voluntarily in mid-July [2007].
Reopening Friday [27 Jul 2007], they were closed twice the
recommended amount of time and have disinfected the kennel. "We only
had to do it twice, I bet we did it 20 times. We did not have
fatalities and I'm convinced it's because we acted quickly," Kane
said. They will be cautious for the rest of the summer.
That means a change in some of the kennel's policies. At Trifecta,
they are asking people if their dog has been in a group setting in
the past 2 weeks. If dogs are coughing when they arrive, they will
not be accepted. And the mingling of pets in the doggy day care
program will not happen until the disease is gone. A few coughing
dogs and the close proximity of the Gilbert outbreak is the reason
for caution at the Monroe County SPCA.
Diagnosis from the nose swab samples taken from dogs this weekend
should be available mid-week, according to Dr. Ravi Murarka, chief
veterinarian at the Pennsylvania SPCA.
In the meantime, Monroe County SPCA is still able to take cats --
they are not affected by canine influenza.

[At this time of the year many dogs are dropped off at kennels while
the family goes away on holiday, though increasingly dogs now
accompany families. Either way they are stressed and this aids in
them acquiring these infections.
