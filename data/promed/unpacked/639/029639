The test [of chickens incoming to Hong Kong from mainland China] involved
is an agar precipitin test; a test for antibody. You are right to wonder
about this, but there is no economical antigen test. I presume that the
thinking is that by first quarantining the chickens for 5 days they are
increasing the chance of detecting antibody.

[Use of this test could be worse than nothing. If the assay system yields
false negatives (due to lack of sensitivity) it could lead to a false sense
of security. If anyone else has information about the assay system being
used in Hong Kong, and its sensitivity and specificity, please let us know.
