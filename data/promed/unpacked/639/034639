When I was in the Patho-biology Lab at the NVSL [National Veterinary
Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, we commonly observed
non-suppurative perivascular cuffs of inflammatory cells in the brains
of large cervids, particularly elk. Elizabeth Williams (University of
Wyoming) and others have reported similar findings as background
lesions in elk. I wonder if moose might have such a similar background
lesion?
These are relatively mild cellular infiltrates, probably less
substantial than those described by Dr. McBurney. He also does not
say whether the brain was examined by IHC [immunohistochemistry or FA
[fluorescent antibody for the presence of rabies virus antigen.
Rabies would be the primary differential diagnosis in a case of
non-suppurative encephalitis from an animal exhibiting neurologic
signs of any kind.

I have participated in other studies of mortality in moose involving
complete necropsy examinations with microscopic examination of nervous
tissues, and I have never seen nonsuppurative perivascular cuffs as a
background lesion in any of those animals. The fact that the moose in
these most recent cases present with neurological clinical signs would
also suggest that the inflammatory lesions are significant.
Terrestrial rabies is not endemic in Atlantic Canada (the raccoon
strain of rabies virus has only recently been diagnosed in
southwestern New Brunswick). Over the years, we have had sporadic
cases of rabies in a variety of terrestrial mammal species involving
bat strains of rabies virus. We have never had small outbreaks
affecting a number of animals over a wide geographical area (which is
how the moose affected by this
condition have presented). Therefore, rabies is not high on my list of
differential diagnoses for this problem. However, having said this,
in the near future I will be utilizing IHC to test for several viral
etiologies, and rabies will be included on this list.
As for WNV, again, [it is not present in our region (we have been
doing wild bird surveillance for the past 2 years). However, Dr.
Harvey Artsob (Health Canada) has recently offered to test for WNV
using IHC at his laboratory.

[Good line of questioning and response. We certainly hope there is an
answer found, and we would be interested in the outcome. - Mod.TG
