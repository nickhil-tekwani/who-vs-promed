[While there have been only 2 confirmed cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in 2021, the continued detection of positive environmental samples in Pakistan signal that the virus is circulating there. It appears as though the challenges of the circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) continue into 2021. Right now, there have been 2 cases attributable to WPV1 and 26 cases attributable to cVDPV2. At the risk of being repetitive, perhaps the time has come to seriously consider IPV.

[2] Afghanistan campaign
Date: Sat 10 Apr 2021

https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-launches-second-national-polio-vaccination-campaign-2021


The 2nd national polio immunization campaign of 2021 was launched today [Sat 10 Apr 2021] by the Ministry of Public Health of Afghanistan, in collaboration with UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO). Approximately 9.9 million children under the age of 5 will be targeted against polio during the 5-day campaign across the country except for a few areas due to extreme weather conditions or security-related access restrictions. A supplementary dose of vitamin A will also be administered to children aged 6-59 months during this campaign. This will help build general immunity among susceptible children to protect them from polio and other diseases.

"Although intense efforts are ongoing to eradicate polio, the continued Taliban-imposed ban on house-to-house polio vaccination campaign in some areas of the country has led to immunity gaps among children, making it difficult to interrupt polio transmission," said Dr Wahid Majrooh, the acting Minister for Public Health. "Approximately 3.3 million children in the areas where these bans exist are repeatedly being deprived of the polio vaccine in each round of the campaign, which has caused an increase in polio cases across the country, especially circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) type 2. If our vaccinators and health workers are able to reach every child, we can control and eradicate polio in a short period of time."

Without access to children in areas that have remained unreachable by the programme for extended periods of time, it will be difficult to stop polio outbreaks. "WHO is increasingly concerned about the declining immunity against polio in populations in areas where house-to-house campaigns remained banned," said Dr Dapeng Luo, WHO Representative in Afghanistan. "All parties must respect the neutrality of health interventions. Unimpeded access to reach children with critical vaccinations and other essential health services is the only way to stop polio and other outbreaks," he added.

In 2020, a total of 56 polio cases caused by wild poliovirus type 1 and more than 300 cases of cVDPV type 2 were reported. So far, in 2021 one case caused by wild poliovirus type 1 and 23 cases of cVDPV type 2 have been reported in predominantly inaccessible areas of the country.

Existing disruptions to critical immunizations caused by active conflict and bans on polio campaigns in certain parts of the country have delayed up to 5 rounds of polio vaccination campaigns. However, the programme remains committed to finishing the job and is continuing to innovate to overcome challenges. Despite hurdles caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and insecurity, more than 7.4 million doses of the polio vaccine have been administered in 2021.

"Under the leadership of the Ministry of Public Health, UNICEF is committed to eradicating polio in Afghanistan and giving every child the best start in life," said Alice Akunga, UNICEF Deputy Representative. "We are pleased that this week, the 2nd polio campaign of 2021 will begin across the country, not only vaccinating children against the scourge of polio, but boosting their immunity against other diseases through providing vitamin A supplements."

Currently, Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only 2 polio-endemic countries in the world. The Government, WHO, UNICEF, and health partners are urgently calling for a combined effort to ensure safe access to vaccinate all children in difficult and conflict-prone areas. Every Afghan has a role to play in ending polio in Afghanistan.

Yemen: Research Terms of Reference: Situation Overview of Polio Outbreak and WASH Needs YEM2103 (March 2021, version 1)
-------------------------------
Rationale
Background
Poliovirus has reemerged in Yemen, with the 1st cases identified in June and July 2020. Since January 2020, 30 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) cases have been reported, spreading among a few select districts in Sa'ada governorate. Sa'ada governorate is located in northwestern Yemen and was estimated to have a population of 934 000 as of the 2021 Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO). It is one of the governorates most affected by both current and previous conflicts in Yemen, with the current conflict originating in the mountainous Houthi strongholds in Sa'ada governorate. According to the 2021 HNO4, Sa'ada governorate is home to an estimated 691 000 people in need of humanitarian assistance, with 20% of those people classified as being in catastrophic need. Sa'ada governorate also has one of the largest populations of internally displaced persons (IDPs) out of all governorates in Yemen, with an estimated 306 000 people displaced (33% of total population). Since January 2020, 30 cVDPV cases have been reported, spreading among a few select districts in Sa'ada governorate. Since January 2020, 73 cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) have been identified in Sa'ada governorate, making the governorate's AFP rate 4 times higher (0.16 cases / 100 000 children under 15) than Yemen's national average (0.04 cases / 100 000).

Intended impact
The World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) have proposed an integrated response to the poliovirus outbreak. The integrated response will address advocacy, communication and social mobilization, and robust immunization (as per global polio response SOPs). The response will consist of a poliovirus vaccination campaign integrated with measles vaccination in Sa'ada, Hajja, and Amran districts; as well as WASH (hygiene items and water treatment) and micronutrient interventions and maternal health services in Sa'ada, Amran, Al Jawf ,and Hajjah districts. Communication and community engagement will also be an integral component of the interventions. The objective of this report is to provide an updated needs overview in Sa'ada governorate in order to inform the WASH component of the 1st round of the integrated cVDPV outbreak response in Yemen. Along with vaccine coverage, poor sanitation and hygiene are major risk factors related to transmission of poliovirus, due to the importance of the fecal-oral transmission route. Until the recent Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) data collection was conducted in October-December 2020, there have been no representative, household-level WASH assessments carried out in Sa'ada governorate since 2018. This assessment will provide critical information to the polio response to ensure that the most vulnerable are targeted for the proper WASH and polio interventions.
