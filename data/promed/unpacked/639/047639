From: Dr. Steve Berger <mberger@post.tau.ac.il>

The following background information on visceral leishmaniasis in Sudan was
extracted from the GIDEON software program:
Visceral leishmaniasis is most common in the Blue Nile, Upper Nile, Jonglei
and Kassala provinces, and the area north of Khartoum. Increasing activity
has occurred in Eastern State, notably along the Rahad and Dinder Rivers.
Activity in Central State (formerly prevalent in Sennar and Singa) has been
decreasing.
- Over 40,000 fatal cases were reported from the western Upper Nile during
1984-1991, and the death toll among the Nuer and Dinka Peoples was
estimated at 200,000 during 1988 to 1995.
- 3 cases of HIV-Leishmania co-infection were reported to November 1995.
- The local agent is _Leishmania donovani_ (archibaldi). The local vectors
are _Phlebotomus orientalis_ and Ph. [_Synphlebotomus martini_ (in the
south).
