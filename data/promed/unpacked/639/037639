New cases of African swine fever (ASF) have been detected on the territory of Volgograd Oblast and Tula Oblast of Russia, reads the official website of Rosselkhoznadzor (the Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance).

On 8 Oct 2013 Volgograd Oblast Veterinary Laboratory checked pathological material of a dead hog found on the territory of the Kletskoye hunting ground (Kletsky District, Volgograd Oblast). Genetic material of the ASF virus was identified during the tests.

The ASF genetic material was also found by the Tula Oblast Veterinary Laboratory that tested the pathological material of a dead pig taken from one of the subsidiary plots of Aleksin District of Tula Oblast.

The veterinary services of Volgograd Oblast and Tula Oblast under supervision of Rosselkhoznadzor are working to localize and prevent the spread of the infection.

As was reported earlier, ASF spread virtually across the entire European part of Russia. The pig-breeding industry is at risk of collapse in some regions. The situation is particularly alarming in Tver Oblast and the adjacent regions, as well as in Voronezh Oblast. The direct losses for the pig-breeding industry make up billions of rubles, the indirect losses amount to dozens of billions [RUB 1 billion = USD 31 million].

The disease does not affect humans.

[The update on ASF in Russia, published by a Belarusian news agency, reflects the grave concern in Belarus about the situation in neighbouring Russia, from where repeated introductions of the disease are feared. Belarus reported to the OIE in July 2013 about its 1st (Grodno oblast, bordering Lithuania) and 2nd (Vitebsk oblast, bordering Russia) ASF outbreaks. Since the publication of Belarus' follow-up report No 2, on 29 Jul 2013, no additional reports have been submitted.

We have been unofficially told that the policy undertaken in Belarus includes large-scale killings of wild boars. Confirmation or otherwise and figures will be helpful.

Since the start of the current (continuing) ASF epizootic in Russia, on 11 Sep 2009, Russia submitted 101 follow-up reports, the most recent one on 4 Sep 2013, pertaining to 261 outbreaks. - Mod.AS
