EU Commission confirms H5N1 virus in North Cyprus
-----------------------------------------------
The deadly H5N1 strain of avian flu has been confirmed in a sample taken
from a bird from northern Cyprus, the European Commission said on Sunday
[29 Jan 2006].
"The European Commission and the Turkish authorities have been informed by
the Community Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza at Weybridge of the
high pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in a sample taken from the area not
under the effective control of the government of Cyprus," the European
Union's executive said in a statement.
It said it had banned the import of live animals or animal products from
the Turkish Cypriot enclave into the EU.

EU Commission says deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu found in Cyprus
-----------------------------------------------
The European Commission has said the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu was
detected in samples from the Turkish [northern part] of Cyprus, the 1st
ever cases to be found on the island.
Cyprus lies some 75 km (45 miles) from the southern coast of Turkey, where
4 people have died from H5N1. The Turkish cases were the 1st human deaths
from avian influenza outside Asia.
The European Union's executive arm is expected to announce soon whether the
positive samples, which were tested by a British laboratory, came from 2
domestic poultry that were diagnosed with bird flu on Wednesday [25 Jan 2006].
The ill birds were detected on Monday [23 Jan 2006] in a village near
Famagusta on the eastern coast of Cyprus. Since then, the Turkish Cypriot
authorities have slaughtered around 1500 poultry in the village.
Strict checks have now been introduced at crossings between the Turkish
Cypriot north of the island and the Greek Cypriot south.
Cyprus has been divided since 1974.

[In the previous posting, it was reported that samples from a dead turkey
and a chicken were taken from close to Incircli, a village on the eastern
part of the island which is also known by the Greek name Makrasykas.
(Latitude 35.0750, Longitude 33.7667). Map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CY/1/Makrasyka.html>.
Significant parts of Turkey's territory have already become infected; see
interactive map, updated 22 Jan 2006, at
<http://poultrymed.com/files/index.html> (go to Maps).
The introduction of the virus into the Turkish-controlled northern part of
Cyprus could have been brought about by (illegally) imported avians or
their products; infected wild birds may also be considered. - Mod.AS]

HK confirms another bird dies of H5N1 flu
-----------------------------------------------
Hong Kong confirmed on Sunday [29 Jan 2006] that an Oriental Magpie Robin,
the 2nd this month, died of H5N1 avian influenza and warned people to avoid
contact with wild birds for fear the disease could infect humans.
The bird was found dead in a privately owned hut in an area called Sha Tau
Kok, not far from the border with China, a government statement said.
Oriental Magpie Robins are common in Hong Kong and often kept as pets. The
government said on 19 Jan 2006 that another one had tested positive for H5N1.
The virus made its 1st known jump to humans in Hong Kong in 1997, killing 6
people. A spokesman with Hong Kong's Agriculture, Fisheries and
Conservation Department reminded the public to observe good personal hygiene.
"They should avoid personal contact with wild birds and live poultry and
clean their hands thoroughly after coming into contact with them," he said.
