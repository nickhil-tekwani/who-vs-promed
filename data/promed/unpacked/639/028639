Outbreak of foot and mouth disease discovered in South Korea
------------------------------------------------------------
Pigs at local farms in South Korea have tested positive for foot and mouth
disease [FMD], Seoul's Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries said Monday [29 Nov 2010].

A suspected outbreak was reported on Sunday [28 Nov 2010] at 2 pig farms in
Andong, North Gyeongsang province. The affected farms raise 5500 and 3500
pigs, respectively, the ministry said, adding suspected animals have been
quarantined.

South Korea's last outbreak of the disease was reported in January [2010],
which was also its first since 2002. The country, however, was cleared free
of the disease on 27 Sep 2010 by the World Organisation for Animal Health
[OIE].

[South Korea suffered, earlier in 2010, 3 FMD events:

1. FMDV serotype A was recorded in Gyeonggi-do province on 2 Jan 2010,
causing 7 outbreaks affecting cattle (6 locations) and deer (one location).
No swine were, reportedly, affected. The outbreak was declared as resolved
on 11 Mar 2010.

2. FMDV serotype O was recorded in the province/island Incheon-Jikhalsi on
8 Apr 2010, causing 8 outbreaks affecting cattle, swine, and goats. This
outbreak was reportedly resolved on 7 Jun 2010.

3. FMDV serotype O was recorded in Chungcheongbuk-do province (1 outbreak)
on 21 Apr 2010, spreading to the adjacent province of Chungcheongnam-do (4
outbreaks), causing a total of 5 outbreaks involving cattle, swine, and
captive wild boars. This outbreak was reportedly resolved on 19 Jun 2010.

The FMDV serotype O involved in 2 of the (geographically separated) events
above, has been designated to be topotype SEA, strain Mya-98. The same
strain was involved, during 2010, in outbreaks in Hong Kong SAR, Japan,
Mongolia, and Russia. In light of the current outbreak affecting swine, it
is likely to be caused by serotype O as well; serotyping and genotyping are
anticipated with interest, as well as data on the possible origin of the
virus and its route of introduction.

The outbreak in North Gyeongsang province mentioned in the report above has
been officially reported to the OIE; see at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=9993>.
