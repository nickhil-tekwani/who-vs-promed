Indonesia cocoa exports slump
-----------------------------
Indonesia, the world's 3rd-largest cocoa producer, has suffered a bad
harvest this year [2011] as wet weather damaged the main crop and
triggered an outbreak of a deadly fungal disease.

Wet weather wreaked havoc on the crop early this year [2011] and
brought back the vascular streak dieback (VSD) across plantations in
[several provinces on] Sulawesi [island].

About 90 percent of Indonesian cocoa growers are smallholders. Output
is likely to plunge about a third to around 400 000 tonnes in 2011.

[Vascular streak dieback (VSD) of cocoa is caused by the fungus
_Oncobasidium theobromae_ which was first identified in Papua New
Guinea in the 1960's. It is a very severe problem in South East Asia,
Melanesia, and parts of the Far East. For example, a potential crop
loss of 30 000 tonnes for SE Asia has been suggested. Symptoms on
mature trees include leaf chlorosis, defoliation, and characteristic
staining of vascular bundles at the leaf scars and infected xylem,
followed by dieback of branches and often death of the tree. VSD also
causes losses among cocoa seedlings, and avocado can also be affected
by the pathogen. The rate of symptom development is closely correlated
with rainfall incidence during prior months.

The fungus is a leaf-penetrating, vascular pathogen. It may have
evolved as an endophyte on an as yet unidentified indigenous host,
before affecting cocoa and avocado, which are both crops introduced to
the region. The rate of disease spread on cocoa is limited and very
few new infections occur beyond 80m (about 300 ft) from diseased
trees. VSD is spread mainly by wind and human activities, transmission
through seed or infected cuttings has not been demonstrated. Strict
quarantine measures applied to the movement of intact plants are
crucial in reducing spread of the disease. Disease management requires
an integrated approach including planting of less susceptible crop
varieties, cultural practices in nurseries and plantations, as well as
fungicide applications.
