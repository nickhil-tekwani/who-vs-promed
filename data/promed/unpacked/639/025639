Benelli, G. Pathogens Manipulating Tick Behavior--Through a Glass, Darkly
-----------------------------
Abstract
Pathogens can manipulate the phenotypic traits of their hosts and vectors, maximizing their own fitness. Among the phenotypic traits that can be modified, manipulating vector behavior represents one of the most fascinating facets. How pathogens infection affects behavioral traits of key insect vectors has been extensively investigated. Major examples include _Plasmodium_, _Leishmania_ and _Trypanosoma_ spp. manipulating the behavior of mosquitoes, sand flies and kissing bugs, respectively. However, research on how pathogens can modify tick behavior is patchy. This review focuses on current knowledge about the behavioral changes triggered by _Anaplasma_, _Borrelia_, _Babesia_, _Bartonella_, _Rickettsia_ and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) infection in tick vectors, analyzing their potential adaptive significance. As a general trend, being infected by _Borrelia_ and TBEV boosts tick mobility (both questing and walking activity). _Borrelia_ and _Anaplasma_ infection magnifies _Ixodes_ desiccation resistance, triggering physiological changes (_Borrelia_: higher fat reserves; _Anaplasma_: synthesis of heat shock proteins). _Anaplasma_ infection also improves cold resistance in infected ticks through synthesis of an antifreeze glycoprotein. Being infected by _Anaplasma_, _Borrelia_ and _Babesia_ leads to increased tick survival. _Borrelia_, _Babesia_ and _Bartonella_ infection facilitates blood engorgement. In the last section, current challenges for future studies are outlined.

[This fascinating report illustrates how some pathogens, TBE virus and _Borrelia_, influence tick behavior making host-seeking and feeding, and hence pathogen transmission, more successful. One might think that infection of ticks by pathogens such as _Anaplasma_, _Borrelia_ and _Babesia_ would occur at the expense of the tick, resulting in reduced longevity, but apparently this is not the case. As a result, should one think of the tick-pathogen relationship cited in the report as symbiotic, rather than parasitic?

One hopes that this report will stimulate other studies of the effects of pathogens on tick behavior and population dynamics. - Mod.TY]
