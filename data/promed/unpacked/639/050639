The Chinese National Health and Family Planning Commission reported 5 additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) on the Mainland. The details of the cases are as follows:

- A 59-year-old male from Fuzhou, Fujian, exposed to poultry market, in serious condition;
- A 58-year-old male farmer from Kunshan, Jiangsu, in serious condition;
- A 63-year-old male from Nantong, Jiangsu, exposed to poultry market, in serious condition;
- A 32-year-old male from Kunshan, Jiangsu, exposed to poultry market, in serious condition; and
- A 64-year-old male from Suzhou, Jiangsu, exposed to poultry market, in serious condition.

From 2013 to date [13 Dec 2016], 783 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported by the Mainland health authorities. In addition to the cases reported on the Mainland, 23 cases imported from China have been reported in Canada (2), Hong Kong (16), Malaysia (1) and Taiwan (4).

According to the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP), avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) or severe respiratory illness (e.g. chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and even death.

People mainly become infected with avian influenza through close contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings. Human-to-human transmission is inefficient. People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian flu. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.

[The additional cases in the above report were from 2 regions in mainland China, all male, and over 55 years except 1 case from Jiangsu. All the cases but 1 are stated to have history of exposure to poultry markets.

Since the emergence of the novel H7N9 influenza A virus in China in 2013, it has circulated mostly throughout mainland China. Along with severe infection and a high mortality rate (approx. 27 percent), it has persisted for more than 2 years, therefore creating 2 epidemic peaks [1, 2]. With the number of human infections increasing, H7N9 virus has become a significant global threat to public health.

To gain a better insight on H7N9 circulating in Huai'an wild and domestic birds, Yang et al collected 496 cloacal swabs and fecal samples from residential habitats of migratory birds and from live poultry markets in 2014, and compared the sequences with the human cases of avian influenza H7N9 reported during the same period who had positive history of contact with poultry in poultry markets [3]. The researchers found that gene segments of H7N9 isolated from chicken in a live poultry market showed the highest similarity with the human viruses (99.3-100.0 percent identity). The epidemiological and genetic data indicate that contaminated live poultry markets are a continuing source of infection in humans. Therefore, it is essential to enhance both epidemiological and laboratory-based influenza surveillance for chicken, duck, and other avian species, specifically in live poultry markets.
