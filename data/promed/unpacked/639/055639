The government has confirmed an outbreak of circulating vaccine derived polio virus (cDVPV), which claimed the life of 2-year-old girl.

Speaking on Tue [15 Jan 2019] during a news briefing, the Kwara Commissioner for Health, Alhaji Usman Rifun-Kolo, disclosed that an outbreak of circulating cDVPV in a Fulani Camp in Kiiparu District of Okuta Ward in Baruten LGA has been confirmed.

He noted that the victim was a 2-year-old girl with symptoms of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), adding that the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the case.

He stated that the victim died of the disease and that contact [follow up] was carried out by the government to collect samples from other children in Fulani settlement. The state's commissioner for health disclosed that the settlers proved difficult and uncooperative and that it took the intervention of the Emir of Okuta to persuade the Fulani settlers of the need to take samples from their children.

According to him, the governor has already approved a budget to commence measures to curb the outbreak of this disease. "We will commence immunisation of children in Baruten and other neighbouring communities," he said.

[Checking prior reports, this is the 1st report of a case of poliovirus associated AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) reported from Kwara state, Nigeria since a case of WPV1 associated disease with onset of paralysis in 2 Sep 2008 (see Poliomyelitis (08): India, Pakistan, worldwide 20081015.3263). According to the media report, this current virus is a cVDPV (serotype as yet undefined).

The above report mentions that this case is from a Fulani camp. The Fulani group is a large ethnic group, estimated at approximately 40 million people, in the Sahel and West Africa but extending across the African continent, including northern Central Africa going on to South Sudan, Sudan. While representing the largest nomadic pastoral community in the world, the majority of the group are semi-sedentary people; approximately 13 million are nomadic. Many of the Fulani have become sedentary and have become leaders of major African countries and International Organizations [excerpted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fula_people].

What is not mentioned in the above report is whether the member of the Fulani camp, including the aforementioned 2-year-old, had recently travelled to other areas in Nigeria where there have been known outbreaks associated with 2 different cVDPV2 strains (one in Jigawa state with subsequent spread to other states as well as to neighboring Republic of Niger, and the other in Sokoto state).

More information on the epidemiology of this current cVDPV case and on the genetic profile of the cVDPV identified would be greatly appreciated. Information on vaccination histories of the case and possible additional laboratory tests on known contacts and others in the community would be very welcome.

[2] Pakistan positive environmental samples, 8 cities

The wide range environmental surveillance established by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme has detected the polio virus from the sewage of 8 populous cities during last month [December 2018].

According to results shared by the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), the presence of poliovirus was confirmed in sewage samples collected from Karachi, Peshawar, Bannu, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Killa Abdullah, Pishin and Quetta during December 2018.

Considering the associated risks, the country programme has urged parents to ensure immunization of all children under the age of 5 years during the upcoming anti-polio campaign scheduled to start from [21 Jan 2019].

"Our case counts are declining, but as long as the virus is present anywhere in the country, the threat of polio remains for the vulnerable children. Continuous population movements to and from these infected cities, therefore, pose a risk to children elsewhere as well," Dr Rana Safdar, National Emergency Operations Coordinator of the Polio Eradication said on Monday [14 Jan 2019].

While acknowledging progress already made towards the noble cause, the recently concluded Technical Advisor Group urged the programme to focus on children who miss vaccination for any reason.

"To finally eradicate the virus, vaccinating all children against all preventable diseases including polio is imperative, both in routine as well as in special door-to-door campaigns," Dr Safdar added.

"The misconception of a caregiver led to paralysis of another child in Bajaur agency, who had every right to live a healthy and productive life. It is a reminder to everyone that no excuse can save your child from paralysis, especially if the child is not repeatedly vaccinated," Babar Bin Atta, the Prime Minister's Focal Person on Polio Eradication said.

He said: "It is also more cumbersome when this paralysis is life long and not reversible. I can't emphasize enough how critically important it is to ensure that each and every child is vaccinated during the upcoming polio campaign during the month of January [2019]."

Sewage water samples are collected on a monthly basis from 58 sampling sites across the country under the supervision of relevant provincial health departments and tested by a state-of-the-art Regional Polio Reference Laboratory housed at the National Institute of Health, Islamabad. The genetic sequencing further guides the programme in undertaking requisite response activities.

"Pakistan stands the best chance of getting rid of the crippling virus forever. Every Pakistani must now assume the role of a polio worker to ensure vaccination of all children during every campaign," Babar Bin Atta urged.

[It is unclear whether this report refers to the cumulative number of cities with positive environmental samples during the month of December 2018 or whether these were an additional set of figures following the most recent weekly summary. In either case, what it represents is what the article concluded: That the poliovirus is widely circulating in Pakistan, and the need to immunize all susceptibles is present in the country.
