[1] Cholera - Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, suspected in Syria

On Friday, 6 Nov 2015, a representative of UNICEF warned of the regional spread of cholera as the cholera outbreak grows, with cases reported in several neighboring countries to include Syria, Kuwait and Bahrain [apparently cases in Syria have not clearly been confirmed - Mod.LL]. In response to this, the Director of Information at the Iraqi Ministry of Health, Dr. Ahmed Al-Rudaini said, "these statements are inaccurate," and "the ministry has taken control of the disease, and it has begun to subside gradually", according to a Al-Sabaah report (computer translated). He said a number of measures including mass vaccination have caused the outbreak to subside.

"The ministry has taken a package of measures that can control the disease, including the provision of half a million doses of cholera vaccine as well as preparation of special isolated wards for patients and examination of patients' attendants as a precaution of the spread of the disease.

"The measures also included continued promotion in the media of all modes of transmission of cholera and how to avoid infection through careful hygiene and washing hands before and after eating, in addition to provision of field health education through visits to schools and IDP camps," Al-Rudaini added, stressing "the role of religious leaders in raising awareness during Friday prayers to make cholera an issue of public concern so people become cautious of the disease."

The number of cholera cases in the Iraq outbreak stands at approximately 2500 cases [an increase from past numbers - Mod.LL].

[2] Cholera - Oman ex Iraq

An Omani woman who recently returned from Iraq has tested positive for cholera, the country's Health Ministry announced. The ministry said the woman has been admitted to a government hospital in Muscat and her condition is stable. 2 other Omanis who were traveling with her tested negative for cholera.

Meanwhile, the Sultanate's Ministry of Endowment and Religious Affairs has issued a health warning to Omanis wanting to visit Iraq.

[It is not clear how many cholera cases are confirmed or suspected in Kuwait and Bahrain and whether the cases were acquired in those countries or, like the above Omani case, were transported from Iraq.

As reported in Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (31): Guinea outbreak vaccine use, 2012 Archive Number: 20140529.2506059, a published study in the England Journal of Medicine from Guinea was the 1st to demonstrate vaccine efficacy during an ongoing outbreak of _V. cholera_. The publication with its citation and abstract is: Luquero FJ, Grout L, Ciglenecki, I, et al: Use of _Vibrio cholerae_ Vaccine in an outbreak in Guinea. N Engl J Med 2014; 370: 2111-20; http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1312680

"Background
------
The use of vaccines to prevent and control cholera is currently under debate. Shanchol is 1 of the 2 oral cholera vaccines prequalified by the World Health Organization; however, its effectiveness under field conditions and the protection it confers in the 1st months after administration remain unknown. The main objective of this study was to estimate the short-term effectiveness of 2 doses of Shanchol used as a part of the integrated response to a cholera outbreak in Africa.

Methods
-----
We conducted a matched case-control study in Guinea between 20 May 2012 and 19 Oct 2012. Suspected cholera cases were confirmed by means of a rapid test, and controls were selected among neighbors of the same age and sex as the case patients. The odds of vaccination were compared between case patients and controls in bivariate and adjusted conditional logistic-regression models.

Results
-----
Between 8 Jun 2012 and 19 Oct 2012, we enrolled 40 case patients and 160 controls in the study for the primary analysis. After adjustment for potentially confounding variables, vaccination with 2 complete doses was associated with significant protection against cholera (effectiveness, 86.6 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 56.7 to 95.8; P=0.001).

Conclusions
-----
In this study, Shanchol was effective when used in response to a cholera outbreak in Guinea. This study provides evidence supporting the addition of vaccination as part of the response to an outbreak. It also supports the ongoing efforts to establish a cholera vaccine stockpile for emergency use, which would enhance outbreak prevention and control strategies.

Although these are small numbers, the investigators working in way less than ideal conditions should be lauded for this study, which may be the "straw that broke the camel's back" regarding using a cholera vaccine during an ongoing outbreak of _V. cholerae_."

The biologic used, Shanchol (produced in India), contains different killed biotypes of bacilli of both O1 and O139 serotypes. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study revealed a cumulative efficacy of the product at 5 years of 65 percent (95 percent CI [confidence interval] 52-74) with significant protection at the p less than 0.0001 level (1). The other WHO-prequalified vaccine, Dukoral, produced in Sweden, contains several biotypes of O1 only together with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit.

As a review, the cholera toxin encoded by the ctxA and ctxB genes is the principal toxin produced by _V. cholerae_ O1 and O139 and is responsible for the disease. The genes are encoded with a filamentous bacteriophage. The toxin has many immunological properties that include impressive adjuvant properties and action as an anti-inflammatory agent. Each toxin molecule contains a catalytic A subunit (the active toxin) and 5 B subunits that bind the holotoxin to its ganglioside GM1 receptor. After internalization, a subunit of A, A1, will catalyze the ribosylation of a GTP-binding protein which increases the activation of adenyl cyclase and a chloride channel CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) which produces increased chloride secretion, intestinal water accumulation and diarrhea. It is mutations in CFTR that produces cystic fibrosis, a disease that affects a number of organs related to difficulties in fluid secretion (2).
