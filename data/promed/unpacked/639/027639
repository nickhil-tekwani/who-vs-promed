Researchers who analyzed the genome of a new coronavirus (CoV) from a South African bat sample demonstrated that it may be the ancestor of MERS-CoV, that a host switch from bats to camels may have taken place in Africa, and that camels are likely infecting humans rather than vice versa, according to a study yesterday [16 Jul 2014] in the Journal of Virology.

A German-South African team, including Christian Drosten, MD of the University of Bonn sequenced the full genome of a CoV isolated from the feces of a South African _Neoromicia capensis_, or Cape serotine, bat and named it NeoCoV. They found that 85 percent of the NeoCoV nucleotide was identical to that of MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), and that the 2 belonged to one viral species.

"The bat virus roots the phylogenetic tree of MERS-CoV, providing evidence for an evolution of MERS-CoV in camels that preceded that in humans," the authors wrote.

The researchers also noted genetic findings that suggest a higher viral diversity of CoV in camels than in humans. "Together with serologic evidence for widespread MERS-CoV infection in camelids sampled up to 20 years back in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, the genetic data indicates that camels act as sources of virus for humans rather than vice versa," they wrote.

The authors conclude: "The acquisition of MERS-CoV by camels from bats might have taken place in Sub-Saharan Africa. Camelids may represent mixing vessels for MERS-CoV and other mammalian CoVs."

---------------------------------------
Abstract:
--------
The emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes lethal respiratory infections mainly on the Arabian Peninsula. The evolutionary origins of MERS-CoV are unknown. We determined the full genome sequence of a CoV directly from fecal material obtained from a South African _Neoromicia capensis_ bat (NeoCoV). NeoCoV shared essential details of genome architecture with MERS-CoV. 85 percent of the NeoCoV genome was identical to MERS-CoV on nucleotide level. Based on taxonomic criteria, NeoCoV and MERS-CoV belonged to one viral species. Presence of a genetically divergent S1 subunit within the NeoCoV Spike gene indicated that intra-Spike recombination events may have been involved in the emergence of MERS-CoV. NeoCoV constitutes a sister taxon to MERS-CoV, placing the MERS-CoV root between a recently-described virus from African camels and all other viruses. This suggests a higher viral diversity in camels than in humans.

Together with serologic evidence for widespread MERS-CoV infection in camelids sampled up to 20 years back in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, the genetic data indicates that camels act as sources of virus for humans rather than vice versa. The majority of camels on the Arabian Peninsula is imported from the greater Horn of Africa, where several _Neoromicia_ species occur. The acquisition of MERS-CoV by camels from bats might have taken place in Sub-Saharan Africa. Camelids may represent mixing vessels for MERS-CoV and other mammalian CoVs.

Importance:
-----------
It is unclear how, when and where the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV emerged. We characterized the full genome of an African bat virus closely related to MERS-CoV and show that human, camel and bat viruses belong to the same viral species. The bat virus roots the phylogenetic tree of MERS-CoV, providing evidence for an evolution of MERS-CoV in camels that preceded that in humans. The revised tree suggests that humans are infected by camels rather than vice versa. Although MERS-CoV cases occur mainly on the Arabian Peninsula, the data from this study together with serologic and molecular investigations of African camels indicate that the initial host switch from bats may have taken place in Africa. The emergence of MERS-CoV likely involved exchange of genetic elements between different viral ancestors. These exchanges may have taken place either in bat ancestors or camels acting as mixing vessels for viruses from different hosts.

[The authors' findings and conclusions are persuasive and deserve attention. On the other hand, I think any final conclusion needs more data. The problem is that there are so many bats, and their taxonomy is largely guess work. A lot more work is needed on bats and their viruses. We know a lot about MERS-CoV now, but very little about bat viruses. Bats carry almost every taxonomic type of mammalian virus, but they transmit very few to mammals.

Nonetheless, this is an interesting piece of research that needs to be consolidated. - Mod.CP

[3] Camel exposures of recent patients

Three of 9 recently diagnosed MERS-CoV patients in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had contact with camels or camel farms, the World Health Organization (WHO) revealed today [14 Jul 2014] in confirming the cases.

Two WHO statements filled in some details on 7 cases in Saudi Arabia and 2 in the UAE. The cases had been mentioned previously in announcements from the 2 countries' health ministries and were reported to the WHO between 3 and 10 Jul 2014.

The Saudi cases involved 6 men and one woman, ranging from 49 to 74 years old. One patient, a 72-year-old man from Arar in Northern Borders province, died, while 2 are in critical condition, and 4 are in stable condition, the WHO reported.

One Saudi patient, a 49-year-old man from Al-Hasa (also spelled Al-Ahsa or Hassa) in the Eastern province owns a farm and had direct contact with camels, goats, and birds, the WHO said in a statement on its website. Samples have been taken from 15 of the patient's contacts and from farm workers and camels for testing, the agency said.

Both of the UAE patients live in Abu Dhabi and have camel connections, according to a WHO statement that was e-mailed to journalists. One, a 67-year-old man who is hospitalized in critical condition, owns a camel farm in Saudi Arabia's Eastern region and had direct contact with camels there 3 months before he fell ill. He also visited a camel farm in Abu Dhabi 2 weeks before he got sick, but he had no direct contact with camels there.

The other UAE patient is a 50-year-old man who was identified in screening of people associated with a farm where a camel was found to have a MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) infection, the agency reported.

The man had no symptoms when he was screened for MERS on 3 Jul 2014, but 2 days later, he experienced a mild cough, and he tested positive for the virus on 6 Jul 2014. His current condition was not mentioned. He had no contact with other confirmed MERS-CoV case-patients before his illness.

Aside from camels, no suspected sources of MERS-CoV exposure were mentioned for any of the patients in today's [14 Jul 2014] WHO statement. Camels are considered a likely source of human MERS-CoV infections, but precisely how the virus jumps from camels to humans has not yet been determined.

The cases described by the WHO today [14 Jul 2014] raised the agency's MERS count to 836 cases, with at least 288 deaths.

[4] Qatar - update, regional control
Date: Thu 17 Jul 2014
Source: The Peninsula, Qatar [summarised, edited]

The World Health Organization says the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, which is known as [MERS] coronavirus, still represents a serious health hazard. The organization adds that this virus, along with another similar one, continues to be carried by camels. The disease is worrying for the countries of the Gulf if it really proves to be caused by these lovely animals.

The latest report of the World Health Organization refers to a decline in virus infections, noting that the virus does not represent an international emergency any more. Even with this, the organisation says most of the infections come from Saudi Arabia.

Most Gulf families, which are packing up now to travel to Saudi Arabia to perform the annual Haj ritual, are starting to worry. Most of these families take their cars and drive toward the holy sites in Saudi Arabia. Some of them eventually meet the lovely camels as they drive through the vast lands of Saudi Arabia. The camels are usually seen running alongside most of the roads leading to Makkah.

This is one reason why supervision has been tightened between the GCC countries [see comment] in collaboration with the international organisation to prevent the spread of the virus. Passports were issued for camels to prevent the entry of unregistered ones.

Qatar has reported 9 coronavirus cases, including 5 who died. No more cases were reported in the country since late last year [2013]. There is coordination between the Supreme Council of Health and Saudi authorities, official sources say. They add that this coordination would start from now and continue until the end of the pilgrimage season. The deal in this regard opens the door for the presence of quarantines as well as doctors. Suspected cases among the pilgrims will also be referred to a hospital.

The question that arises now is: How are people being infected by the coronavirus? The WHO says it does not know how this happens. The organisation adds that it is investigating at present about the source of the virus.

Even with this, the organisation says humans will not likely contract the virus by coming in touch with an infected camel. It adds that a very small number of patients said they had come in contact with camels. This underlines the need for more investigation on new cases.

Our camels are in danger. The fear is that they turn out to be dangerous themselves and that they are the prime suspect behind carrying this deadly virus. The authorities have taken strict measures for preventing the import of camels from the GCC countries. Camels suspected to be carrying the virus are also quarantined for 30 days. Sorry to say, studies have shown that the virus continues to exist among the camels under study in Qatar.

It is difficult for us to accept that our camels carry this fatal virus. Camels are part of our history and heritage. We enjoy eating their tasty meat and drinking their healthy milk. We also enjoy riding them. But the people of the desert are likely to be deprived of all this. They will be deprived of practising their coveted hobby of riding the camels in special camel races.

["GCC" means "The Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf," a regional intergovernmental political and economic union consisting of all Arab states of the Persian Gulf, except for Iraq. Its member states are the Islamic monarchies of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Implementing interstate control upon the movements of camels into and between those countries and their compulsory registration will be a long desired step towards essential camel disease control. Registration will require camels to be individually identifiable.

MERS-CoV is just one (though currently in the focus of public attention) health issue said to be related to camels. This is still in need of final proof. Other diseases of camels, including zoonoses, are also in need of attention and control, to name just one, brucellosis. According to sero-surveys carried out in Saudi Arabia between 1987-2007, the percentages of positive camels were 1.4, 8.0, 8, 0, 7.1, 1.86 and 3.03. (see reference).
