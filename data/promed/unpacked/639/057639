[This moderators comments appeared in a previous posting: Perhaps someone
inside the Canadian ministry can tell us why the oral rabies vaccine
program, which has proven safe, effective and cost efficient, is not being
utilized? It requires fewer man-hours (less labor intensive) and vaccinates
a larger number of animals than can be trapped and vaccinated. - Mod.TG
This is not a simple question:
First, oral vaccination success is variable in the field, and assessable
only months after the fact. First campaign results usually result in 15- 55
percent of raccoons having serum antibody. There is scanty laboratory
evidence that some animals treated with the Raboral recombinant vaccine may
resist challenge despite never having had antibody. Antibody in captive
raccoons is often of short duration (most frequently seen 30-60 days after
the bait was eaten), and animals which had such antibody are quite likely
to resist challenge (21 of 27 in one study). Field antibody results
probably underestimate herd immunity in the wild, because of the above,
coupled with the fact that one has very limited knowledge of when a wild
raccoon may have eaten the bait.
Most baits which have been dropped also contain tetracycline, which gives a
measure of bait uptake directly. Again, results from field programs are
highly variable, and somewhat disappointing, mostly ranging from 27 - 60
percent, with , however, some values as high as 90 percent, for first
campaigns. Not every wild animal which eats enough bait to be marked gets
immunized. In fact, in captive raccoons, results from eating a single bait
may sometimes be lower than 50 percent.
The more we all work with baits in the field, the more we realize how
little we know about the comparative attractiveness of baits to raccoons in
the face of natural foods. One study at Cornell showed higher bait uptake
in rural vs urban raccoons. It was clear that the rural raccoons were
short of food and ate baits as soon as they encountered them, whereas the
urban animals had significantly greater body masses, and were less avid in
their approach to baits. Perhaps some of the observed variability of field
results comes from shortage or abundance of natural food, but that is just
a guess. And, of course, many variables influence local availability of
raccoon food over time.
By contrast to baits, Trap-Vaccinate-Release (TVR) provides higher
vaccination rates more predictably. It has the added advantage that the
population vaccination rate can be assessed quite rapidly (because all
vaccinated animals are also ear-tagged), and there is a well-established
relation between trapping effort and percent vaccinated.
If you want more vaccinated, trap for more nights. Injected vaccine is more
than 98 percent effective, and gives long-lasting antibody. Our normal TVR
results are 65-75 percent vaccinated (8 nights of trapping over 2 weeks)
when evaluated by recaptures in the year of trapping, and 50-55 percent of
adults caught the following year will have eartags, and therefore antibody.
The rationale for killing animals in the inner zone was to remove animals
which were potentially incubating rabies. Presumably most raccoons
vaccinated with Imrab (a type of rabies vaccine) while incubating rabies
would still develop the disease. Thus, the removal zone was designed to
lower the number of potential future cases that were also carrying rabies
at the time the first case was detected. Note that the latter individuals
will not show up as rabies positive when tested by conventional means. The
trapping for the removal zone followed the same procedures as used for TVR.
Cost, effort and timeliness are also variables.
The cost of trapping is roughly the same per unit area as the cost of
baiting. Whereas in trapping the cost goes to salaries, oral vaccination
requires a lot of money for baits (70 baits/square km, at $1.50 US/bait).
TVR takes longer when large areas are to be treated. For example, our
Niagara TVR area covers 690 sq. km, and takes 7 trappers from 1 July to 15
October to treat completely. By contrast, one airplane could drop baits
over the whole area in one day.
However, in an unexpected emergency such as this one, timeliness is also
essential, and the variables are often reversed. We heard of the first
rabies case on Wednesday 14 July, and had 14 trappers in the area by
Thursday afternoon. This instant response was possible because these were
the trappers maintaining our two major TVR zones. They completed the whole
point outbreak program in two weeks. The area of the second case will be
treated by trappers who live in the area, because the TVR trappers had to
get back to their regular duties, and to their homes.We had 50 liters of
Raboral, the oral vaccine, on order months ago, and had not received it at
the time of the incident. It would still have to be put into baits. We did
not have regulatory approval to use Raboral in Canada, and the emergency
bait supply maintained by Merial could not be used because of labeling
requirements for Canada being different. Therefore, we expect to have the
first baits available about 6 weeks after the first incident. Since we have
had a definite probability of a raccoon rabies case in Ontario since April
1995, it would have been expensive to maintain a reserve of baits locally
while waiting for the first case.
Thus, the decision to go with trapping rather than oral vaccination was
based on timeliness, knowledge of probable efficacy, and available
resources. I suppose that is a normal real-world situation.

[I appreciate Charlie sharing this information with us. He has been on the
some of the bait drops in south Texas that have been very successful in
coyote rabies control, where trapping is not an option. Coyotes are
suspicious about traps while raccoons are a bit more greedy and less
suspicious of trappings. Thanks. - Mod.TG
