[1] Somerset farm infected, apparently from badgers

A farm that provided a dry haven for wildlife during the Somerset [county, England] floods has gone down with TB [tuberculosis] for the 1st time ever.

About 200 acres of the 380-acre Oath Farm, Burrowbridge, was badly flooded earlier this year [2014], but the higher land remained dry and was inundated by wildlife seeking to escape the waters.

"We were a complete island, with only the raised Taunton-Paddington railway line crossing the farm," said John Perrin, who keeps 100 Charolais suckler cows with his father Dave.

"There are lots of badger setts in the embankment, and our farm was the 1st bit of dry land they could get to. We had a dozen or more badgers in the yard, walking around in broad daylight," he added.

"We're a closed herd and have never had TB -- but during the floods we had every badger in Christendom here."

With the livestock sheds remaining about a foot above the flood level, the Perrins managed to house their stock during the floods, and learned of the TB breakdown on 1 May [2014].

"We had 2 reactors and 6 inconclusive reactors, so we're retesting next week," said Mr Perrin Jnr.

"We haven't been able to move or sell anything. And after the floods we had no grass or anywhere dry to turn the cows on to. There are some fields that we're only just able to get back on to now. It has been an absolute nightmare."

DEFRA [UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] has dismissed new research suggesting Britain's bovine TB [bTB] epidemic is driven largely by cattle movements, with badgers playing only a relatively small part.

The study by researchers from the University of Warwick, published in the Nature journal on Wednesday [2 Jul 2014; see item 3 further], sparked controversy with its suggestion that one of the few measures that could have a substantial impact on cattle bTB levels is a move to whole herd slaughter.

In contrast, culling badgers will have little impact, the study concluded.

The researchers have produced what they claim to be the 1st national model to investigate bTB spread, using data from 1996 to 2011 covering TB breakdowns and cattle movements. The model looked at both infection within farms and from farm to farm.

The results painted a complex picture, suggesting most of herd outbreaks were caused by multiple transmission routes, with only 29 per cent attributable to a single cause.

The main routes of infection were flawed cattle TB tests which fail to pick up infection and movements, and reinfection from environmental reservoirs, including infected pastures and wildlife, mainly badgers.

The researchers concluded 84 per cent of new infections were caused by animal movements, with just 10 per cent of farms -- labelled 'superspreaders' -- responsible for virtually all these infections. They suggested, while environmental infection may be implicated in up to 80 per cent of all herd breakdowns, its role is mainly in sustaining infection at local level. In contrast, the environment 'only contributes weakly' -- around 15 percent -- to new breakdowns.

Their modelling suggested badger culling will have a 'relatively limited effect', reducing bTB in cattle by around 6 per cent, comparable with the results of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial, according to Professor Matthew Keeling, one of the lead researchers.

However, the researchers acknowledged that, owing to a lack of data, the model 'does not explicitly include' the role of badgers in bTB transmission, although Prof Keeling, insisted the wider 'environmental' term used instead does reflect 'what is actually occurring'.

The modelling suggested only 3 policies could have a substantial impact on bTB in cattle, including whole herd slaughter, which, at the extreme, could result in a 20-fold increase in TB slaughterings in the 1st year.

While acknowledging the impact this would have on farms, the researchers said this might be an 'acceptable cost' in the long-term, if, as they predict, it reduces TB levels by 80 per cent within 6 years.

The modelling also concluded improving the TB test would also make a significant difference.

"Imperfect cattle skin tests contribute to the spread by delaying the time until infected herds are detected for the 1st time and incorrectly identifying herds as clear of infection," said co-author Dr Ellen Brooks-Pollock of the University of Cambridge.

The 3rd measure identified as having the power to reverse the current TB trend was cattle vaccination.

Dr Brooks-Pollock acknowledged, however, that the researchers 'didn't consider the practicalities or economics of implementing control measures'.

But farming Minister George Eustice said DEFRA could not accept the paper's findings because it does not investigate the full range of ways in which TB could spread.

He insisted badger culling -- along with blanket testing and removal of infected cattle, biosecurity measures, vaccination and cattle movement controls -- 'will help get this disease under control'.

"What this paper proposes would finish off the cattle and dairy industry in this country," he said.

DEFRA's Chief Scientific Adviser, Professor Ian Boyd, added: "Based on our current understanding of the disease cycle, the more severe control measures suggested by the paper would probably result in a rapid decline in the cattle industry in areas where TB occurs. "However, the study reinforces the basis of the current TB control strategy which is designed to cope with complex and diverse routes of infection."

Responding to Mr Eustice's comments Prof Keeling and Dr Brooks-Pollock said the model was intended as a 'dispassionate analysis of the information to date'. They stressed they were not criticising current control measures and were not advocating whole herd culling as a 'viable policy option'.

"Whole herd culling was investigated as one extreme but was never put forward as a viable policy option. Throughout we have stressed that any decision requires input from multiple sectors with scientific prediction only forming one element," they said.

Re: Ellen Brooks-Pollock, Gareth O. Roberts, Matt J. Keeling. A dynamic model of bovine tuberculosis spread and control in Great Britain (letter)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most complex, persistent and controversial problems facing the British cattle industry, costing the country an estimated BP 100 million [about USD 171.6 million] per year. The low sensitivity of the standard diagnostic test leads to considerable ambiguity in determining the main transmission routes of infection, which exacerbates the continuing scientific debate. In turn this uncertainty fuels the fierce public and political disputes on the necessity of controlling badgers to limit the spread of infection. Here we present a dynamic stochastic spatial model for bovine TB in Great Britain that combines within-farm and between-farm transmission. At the farm scale the model incorporates stochastic transmission of infection, maintenance of infection in the environment and a testing protocol that mimics historical government policy. Between-farm transmission has a short-range environmental component and is explicitly driven by movements of individual cattle between farms, as recorded in the Cattle Tracing System. The resultant model replicates the observed annual increase of infection over time as well as the spread of infection into new areas. Given that our model is mechanistic, it can ascribe transmission pathways to each new case; the majority of newly detected cases involve several transmission routes with moving infected cattle, reinfection from an environmental reservoir and poor sensitivity of the diagnostic test all having substantive roles. This underpins our findings on the implications of control measures. Very few of the control options tested have the potential to reverse the observed annual increase, with only intensive strategies such as whole-herd culling or additional national testing proving highly effective, whereas controls focused on a single transmission route are unlikely to be highly effective.

[Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) has been successfully eradicated from a considerable number of countries, particularly in Europe, where national control schemes, based upon the traditional "test and slaughter" policy, were systematically applied since the 1950s. Conditional to succesful eradication, the animals should be individually identifiable, their "interfarm" movements controlled, skin-tests with PPD (purified protein derivative) tuberculins periodically performed and meat inspection consistently applied by authorised inspectors (preferably veterinarians) on each slaughtered bovine. This moderator can testify for such a scenario in Israel, where initially bTB incidence of 13 percent was recorded in dairy cattle. Following the completion of a 3-phase eradication scheme, commenced in 1950, the disease could be proclaimed eradicated in 1973 from dairy and beef cattle, and this situation is being maintained to the present day. The difference between such countries and the UK is the exposure of uninfected cattle in "clean" UK farms to repeated reintroductions of the agent from free-roaming, infected badgers. Attempts to control the disease in cattle while neglecting the ongoing circulation of the bacterium in wildlife seem Sisyphean, enabling further infections in cattle, in other animal species and in humans. - Mod.AS]

[Way back when I was with MAFF (UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) they were on the edge of total eradication using traditional test and slaughter, which would have had to struggle with interfarm livestock movements, which are now, 40 years later, claimed to be causing the very severe problem of today. There has been no major genomic change. The only change was the infection of Cornish badger in the late 1960s/early 1970s. Any and every model has to be validated, rigorously. - Mod.MHJ
