The UNICEF field office in Wau said it has so far confirmed 6 measles cases among the displaced persons at the UN protection site in Wau town.

According to the organisation's field office head in Wau, Shafeeq-ur-Rehman, the 6 cases were confirmed within this week [week of 21 Nov 2016] after an official test carried out on the suspected cases within the UNMISS [United Nations Mission in South Sudan] camp site.

The official said among the 6 cases, no death case has been reported, adding that the reported 6 cases have been completely well diagnosed.

UNICEF said the 6 confirmed cases are from the UNMISS protection site, mostly children under 15 years of age. "As you know that UNICEF had been working with other actors in the general population, but also responding to the displaced people in the camps, we are working on all areas like education, water and sanitation, and child protection," he said.

Shafeeq-ur-Rehman said UNICEF in collaboration with the ministry of health began [training] vaccinators in order to scale up the campaign at displaced persons camps in Wau on [Fri 25 Nov 2016]. "Since yesterday [24 Nov 2016], we have been doing the training of vaccinators and that training will end [Thu 24 Nov 2016] and from tomorrow [Fri 25 Nov 2016] we will kick off a vaccination campaign at all displacement sites within Wau town and our target is the UNMISS IDPs [internally displaced people] site," he said. He said the campaign will target about 17 000 children under the age of 15.

[2] Immunization study
Date: Wed 23 Nov 2016

[Measles is a] highly contagious disease the United States put down decades ago. But, Princeton University-led research [see reference below] looked at an outbreak in 18 schools in 1904 London (England) and using mathematical models and statistical inference to determine the threat is not completely gone today.

The study's [1st] author, [Alexander] Becker said, "And what we found was schools act as potential transmission hotspots and that measles may transfer more quickly in schools than we've thought based on the population level estimates. And then what we did is take these schools and these estimates of transmission and we applied it to the contemporary era, so 2016, and we found that basically that maintaining high vaccine rates is very important to prevent transmission."

There's a growing movement against vaccinations -- parents linking immunization to autism, other side effects, and even spreading diseases themselves. So, Sue Collins who co-founded the New Jersey Coalition for Vaccination Choice, says to blame the unvaccinated is very unfair.

Primary care doctor Thomas Ortiz says he's counseled parents with concerns. Dr Ortiz said, "As we've spend a lot of time educating our patients, in terms of the benefits the reasons why getting the vaccines, it's a completely safe vaccine. There isn't any reason why anybody should be afraid of it from the point of view of any side effects. And it saves lives."

But, even in this vaccine era, outbreaks do occur. Dr Meg Fisher -- the former head of the American Academy of Pediatrics New Jersey Chapter -- reminds us of one. She said, "We all remember the measles outbreak from Disneyland where a visitor came to Disneyland and many people were exposed. Subsequently many, many states were involved and there were outbreaks among children who not immunized." Dr Fisher says worldwide a child dies every 20 minutes from measles and about the study's conclusion, "this is what we've known for a long time, and again it's the reason for us really wanting there to be immunization requirements for school attendance."

Salem County [New Jersey] has the highest rate of immunization in the state, Monmouth the lowest, and the overall state at 95 per cent.

What the Princeton University research makes clear is that unvaccinated children put themselves at risk of measles and the greater student population of a measles outbreak, a risk it considers unnecessary.

[Evidence surrounding vaccination shows that preventing suffering and death from infectious diseases outweighs any adverse effects [1]. Immunization programs depend on public confidence to be effective. Safety concerns often follow a pattern: a potential adverse effect is hypothesized; a premature announcement is made; the initial study is not reproduced; and finally, it takes several years for the vaccine to regain public confidence [1]. A modern and notable example involved Andrew Wakefield's discredited claims of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccines causing autism.

Public reaction has contributed to a significant increase in preventable diseases, notably measles [2,3]. In 2011 the vaccine-autism connection was described as "the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years" [4].
