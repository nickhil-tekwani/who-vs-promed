-------------------------
Just notified of our 1st case this year (2009) in an Angus Cow from

[Our thanks to Jim for this report. Further details have been requested.
Schleicher County rarely reports anthrax but it should be kept in mind that
it is sparsely populated and cautious. The county seat, El Dorado, has only
1951 people (2000 census) in 712 households of which only 513 are in El
Dorado itself. I would not be surprised if this outbreak turns out to be a
single diagnosis of a larger series. The adjoining county, Sutton, to the
south has had outbreaks in the recent past. - Mod.MHJ
