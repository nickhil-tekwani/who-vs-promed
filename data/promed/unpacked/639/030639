The New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets has 3 more equine cases of West Nile virus (WNV) [infection], according to the Equine Disease Communications Center (EDCC), which says this brings the total to 12 cases in 2018 in New York.

On 18 Sep 2018 a 17 year old mare from Mayville, New York (Chautauqua county) was unsteady on her feet, which progressed over a few days' time. The mare was unvaccinated and was euthanized on 20 Sep 2018.

On 19 Sep 2018, a 25 year old, unvaccinated gelding from Leroy NY (Genesee county) had a high fever. The next day, he developed ataxia, tremors and lost his appetite. Veterinary treatment was initiated, and this horse was alive as of 28 Sep 2018.

On 21 Sep 2018 an unvaccinated 16 year old gelding from Albion, NY (Orleans county) had behavior changes, incoordination and loss of appetite. The veterinarian initiated treatment, and as of 28 Sep 2018, the gelding is recovering quite well.

In all 3 cases, blood tests confirmed active WNV infection.

A horse in Le Roy has been confirmed to have West Nile virus, among 12 such cases in the state [New York] this year [2018], according to the state Department of Agriculture and Markets.

The Equine Disease Communication Center reported Friday [28 Sep 2018] 3 more confirmed West Nile virus cases in the state [see [1] above].

Among the dozen cases confirmed this year [2018], one has been in Livingston County, and an earlier case was in Lyndonville, Orleans County.

On 2 Sep 2018, a 12 year old gelding in Piffard was found to have hind end weakness. The horse had not been vaccinated in 2 years. Despite medical treatment, the weakness progressed, and the horse was euthanized due to poor progress and its failure to rise, according to EDCC. The horse in the Lyndonville case was reported to be recovering.

There were 22 confirmed cases of West Nile virus in horses in 2017, a notable increase from 2016 when the EDCC reported 3 cases and 2015 in which one case was reported.

The state Department of Agriculture and Markets in September 2018 urged horse owners statewide to vaccinate their horses to reduce the risk of West Nile virus. "This is the time of year when the risk of West Nile virus and other mosquitoborne diseases goes up significantly," said commissioner Richard H Ball of the state Agriculture & Markets Department in a news release. "Taking simple, proactive steps to protect yourself and your animals can be extremely effective in reducing the chance of getting ill."

Infected mosquitoes can pass West Nile virus to humans, horses and other animals, but infected horses cannot spread the disease to other animals or people.

Symptoms can resemble the flu, with horses appearing mildly anorexic and depressed. Horses can also experience fine and coarse muscle and skin twitching, fever, hypersensitivity to touch and sound, and mental changes. Other signs can include drowsiness, weakness on one side, an unsteady gait, an inability to rise, and a loss of control of body movements.

Horses exhibiting signs of West Nile virus should be immediately examined by a veterinarian and reported to the state Department of Agriculture and Markets and the local health department. Horse owners should also remove stagnant water sources to reduce mosquito populations and breeding areas. If possible, animals should be kept inside early in the morning and evening, when mosquitoes feed.

[Regardless of where you are, in the north or the south, the east or the west, you need to vaccinate your horse against the diseases that mosquitoes carry. A vaccine against West Nile virus is available and very effective. It is combined with eastern and western equine encephalitis and usually with tetanus as well.

Please use mosquito sprays approved for horses, and keep your animals and facilities sprayed to reduce the chances that your vaccinated horse will succumb to this disease. - Mod.TG
