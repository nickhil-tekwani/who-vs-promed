The Pima [County] Animal Care Center [PACC] is suspending its intake and treating the dogs it currently has with antibiotics after a dog was recently found dead in its kennel.

The PACC said veterinarians are concerned the dog may have had _Streptococcus equi zooepidemicus_ or "strep zoo," a highly contagious bacterial infection which can often be deadly.

Strep zoo is typically found in livestock but can cause severe pneumonia in dogs. There is no vaccine and few warning signs.

The disease rarely affects cats.

While PACC's team waits for test results, all non-emergency admissions to the shelter have been stopped. Intake appointments have also been canceled.

Any adoptive or foster families having other pets are encouraged to keep their recently taken in animals away from other pets for the next 3 days.

Anyone who has adopted or fostered a dog on Saturday and Sunday (23-24 Apr 2022), is asked to come to the PACC clinic during business hours to get a 10-day supply of antibiotics.

Additionally, all dog walking has been shut down for the section of the shelter where the dog who died was housed. That section has been locked to ensure no one accidentally enters the area.

"We're exercising an abundance of caution to protect the animals in the shelter and the community and starting antibiotic prophylaxis for all animals in the shelter. If this is not strep zoo, we plan to resume normal operations on 28 Apr 2022. If it is, we will likely have to extend the temporary halt to admissions a few more days," PACC Director Monica Danger was quoted as saying in a news release.

However, PACC is still open for adoptions. Anyone who wants to adopt or foster will be sent home with a course of antibiotics.

Anyone who needs to give up a pet is asked to visit PACC's Pet Support Page, exhaust all efforts to re-home their pet, or contact other area shelters. Only pets in medical distress, aggressive pets, and any pet involved in a situation where a human or animal is injured will be taken.

In the meantime, PACC is seeking emergency foster families to take in any incoming dogs for at least 3 days.

["_Streptococcus equi_ subsp._ zooepidemicus_ (_S. zooepidemicus_) has caused several outbreaks of hemorrhagic pneumonia in dogs in recent years. This highly contagious and often fatal disease is characterized by sudden onset of clinical signs including pyrexia (fever), dyspnea (difficulty breathing), and hemorrhagic nasal discharge (bleeding from the nose). Post mortem examination typically reveals pulmonary hemorrhage and pleural effusion. Histopathology demonstrates fibrinosuppurative, necrotizing, and hemorrhagic pneumonia in most cases. The pathogenesis of _S. zooepidemicus_ infection in dogs is incompletely understood. Bacterial virulence factors as well as host factors may contribute to the severe outcome.

"_S. zooepidemicus_ occasionally causes zoonotic infections with potentially serious consequences. Canine vaccines for _S. zooepidemicus_ are currently not available, and prevention of the disease, therefore, relies on limiting bacterial spread by implementing stringent control measures in kennels. Further research, particularly sequence analysis of canine strains, is required to gain insights into epidemiology and pathogenesis of this emerging disease."
