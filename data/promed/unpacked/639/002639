Several cases of measles have been linked to a cinema, McDonald's restaurant, and a hospital A&E department, it has been revealed.

Public Health Wales has confirmed that a "cluster" of cases of measles has been reported in particular areas of Rhyl, Denbighshire.

A spokeswoman said there are currently 3 confirmed cases of the infection and 2 related suspected cases.

It is understood that these people spent time in public while they were contagious, which means the measles may have spread.

Public Health Wales (PHW) is warning people to be vigilant if they were in any of the [places listed at the source URL above].

The Healthcare Ministry reported 55 300 people, including 25 987 adults and 29 316 children, have been sickened with measles in Ukraine since 28 Dec 2018 up to 27 Jun 2019.

During the last week, 24-30 Jun 2019, 601 people were infected with measles, 287 adults and 314 children. The majority of the cases were spotted in Kyiv region (57 people:30 adults, 27 children), Lviv region (56 people: 20 adults, 36 children), and Kyiv (50 people: 27 adults, 23 children).

It is reported that over 110 000 people sickened with measles since summer 2017; 39 of them died.

Earlier, the UN reported that 70 percent of all measles cases in Europe are observed in Ukraine.

Besides, all adults will get the vaccines against measles for free. Acting Healthcare Minister Ulyana Suprun reported that another 780 000 vaccines against measles will be bought by Ukraine in 2019.

Earlier, a 2-year-old boy deceased because of the complications caused by measles. The deadly case was observed in Lviv, western Ukraine. Moreover, a 9-year-old girl died from measles in the Rivne region.

Holidaymakers planning a trip to Europe this summer [2019] are urged to make sure they are up-to-date on their MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccinations says Public Health England.

Public Health England South West wants to make sure that anyone wanting a break in Europe is up-to-date with MMR vaccination.

It comes as campaigning by anti-vaxxers has led to a rise in cases of measles in the UK as well as across Europe in recent years.

There were more than 230 confirmed cases of measles in the UK in the 1st 3 months of this year [2019] alone.

The disease is still endemic in many countries around the world including Europe, with France, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, and Germany among the countries reporting the highest case counts according to the European Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC)

The number of cases confirmed in England has been rising since 2018, with many linked to importations from Europe, Public Health England said.

Provincial health authorities have declared a 2nd case of measles in recent days in Laval [Quebec] and expanded a list of locations in the city at which people may have been exposed to the virus in late June [2019].

Health authorities say 2 people infected with the virus travelled on several Societe de transport de Laval (STL) buses and visited a gym and a number of commercial areas on Wed 26 Jun and Sat 29 Jun 2019 [listed at the source URL above]. Those people are believed to have been contagious at the time.

A previous measles warning in the area was issued less than a month ago.

[6] USA: 1095 cases 4:19 PM

Source: Reuters [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-measles/u-s-recorded-18-new-cases-of-measles-last-week-idUSKCN1TW2Y6


The United States recorded 18 new measles cases last week [week of 24 Jun 2019], taking the total for the year to 1095 in the worst outbreak since 1992, federal health officials said on [Mon 1 Jul 2019].

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it has recorded cases of the highly contagious and sometimes deadly disease in 28 states as of 27 Jun 2019, the majority of them in New York City and nearby Rockland county.

The running tally includes both active cases and those that have since resolved. No fatalities have been reported.

Health experts say the virus has spread among school-age children whose parents declined to give them the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which confers immunity to the disease. A vocal fringe of US parents cite concerns that the vaccine may cause autism, despite scientific studies that have debunked such claims.

Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, meaning there was no continuous transmission of the disease for a year. Still, cases of the virus occur and spread via travelers coming from countries where measles is common.

CDC officials have warned that the country risks losing its measles elimination status if the ongoing outbreak, which began in October 2018 in New York, continues until October 2019.

[7] New York (Rockland county): summer camps
Date: Mon 1 Jul 2019 6:25 PM
Source: New York Post [edited]
https://nypost.com/2019/07/01/rockland-county-summer-camps-suing-over-measles-vaccine-requirement/


In a bid to get around local health officials efforts to curb the measles outbreak, a group is suing over the requirement that campers in Rockland county get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease -- and provide the documents to prove it -- arguing that the mandate puts campers' private information at risk.

In the suit, filed [Mon 1 Jul 2019] in federal court in White Plains against Rockland's health commissioner and other officials, the American Camp Association of New York and New Jersey alleges that camps in the county are being held "hostage" by the requirement to turn over an "unprecedented" amount of information about campers with no assurances that the data will be kept safe -- and that the Rockland County Department of Health is using the threat of pulling camps' licenses if it doesn't get its way.

Susie Lupert, the executive director for American Camp Association, said that the 17 summer camps affiliated with her group are already hit with a raft of different regulations that smaller, "single activity" camps -- of which she estimated there are thousands throughout the state -- don't have to face.

Rockland county's new requirement that the camps fork over campers' personal data and health records to government bureaucrats -- which must be done via fax -- puts thousands of campers' privacy at risk, the suit argues.

"I believe that their hearts are in the right place and that they're overreacting," Lupert said of county health officials. Camps that do not show that campers and camp staff have been vaccinated are subject to fines.

Measles outbreaks have affected communities throughout the greater New York area, but Rockland county has been particularly hard hit -- there have been 276 confirmed measles cases since 1 Oct 2018, according to a spokesman for Rockland county.

Earlier this year [2019], the state government eliminated a religious exemption from vaccine requirements, while Rockland county executive Ed Day declared a state of emergency over the outbreak.

In a written statement, Rockland county attorney Thomas Humbach said that the American Camp Association's claims that the reporting requirement infringes on camps' constitutional right to be free of illegal searches and seizures "couldn't be further from the truth."

"Frankly, under the liberal disclosure requirement of the federal courts, the American Camp Association's poorly conceived lawsuit is more likely to result in the public disclosure of private information sought from the camps than any of the activities of" the county health department.

New cases of measles have reached a new record in the country, even as the rate of new cases is slowing.

The latest report from the CDC shows there are now 1109 confirmed cases in 28 states. That's an increase of 14 cases from the week before.

The hardest hit state is still New York, where there are nearly 900 reported cases.

This continues to be the worst measles outbreak in the US since 1992.

[9] Australia (Sydney, New South Wales) ex SE Asia; (Brisbane, Queensland) ex overseas

A young Sydney man who recently returned from travelling around South East Asia has been diagnosed with measles and spent over a week visiting parts of the city while infectious.

NSW [New South Wales] Health issued an alert late this afternoon [9 Jul 2019] as the man, who was vaccinated as a child, had spent time in Hornsby, Lane Cove, Lindfield, the Sydney CBD, Newtown and Erskineville between 30 Jun and 8 Jul 2019 and used public transport [see source URL above for locations.]

Earlier today [9 Jul 2019], another case of measles was reported in Brisbane [Queensland] after a child developed symptoms following an overseas holiday.

The latest case is the 4th in the Metro North area this year [2019], the Brisbane Times reports. The last reported case involved a West Moreton woman who had travelled interstate, according to Queensland Health.

The alert follows a warning sent out by health authorities over the weekend in NSW after a man with measles spent 4 days in Sydney while on holiday from Queensland's Gold Coast.

The man, aged in his 40s, was infectious while travelling [see source URL above for locations].

More than 40 people have been diagnosed with measles in NSW since Christmas [2018]. Despite the high number of people being diagnosed with measles, a recent report has shown vaccination rates in NSW are at their highest levels, with more than 95 per cent of 5-year-olds vaccinated.

[10] Historical amnesia
Date: August 2019
Source: The Atlantic [abridged, edited]
https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/08/measles-as-metaphor/592756/


The return of a vanquished disease reflects historical amnesia, declining faith in institutions, and a troubling lack of concern for the public good.

Declining vaccination rates not only reflect a great forgetting; they also reveal a population that suffers from overconfidence in its own amateur knowledge. In her book Calling the shots: Why parents reject vaccines, the University of Colorado at Denver's Jennifer Reich notes that starting in the 1970s, alternative-health movements "repositioned expertise as residing within the individual." This ethos has grown dramatically in the internet age, so much so that "in arenas as diverse as medicine, mental health, law, education, business, and food, self-help or do-it-yourself movements encourage individuals to reject expert advice or follow it selectively." Autodidacticism can be valuable. But it's one thing to Google a food to see whether it's healthy. It's quite another to dismiss decades of studies on the benefits of vaccines because you've watched a couple of YouTube videos. In an interview, Reich told me that some anti-vaccine activists describe themselves as "researchers," thus equating their scouring of the internet on behalf of their families with the work of scientists who publish in peer-reviewed journals.

In many ways, the post-1960s emphasis on autonomy and personal choice has been liberating. But it can threaten public health. By vaccinating their own children, and thus ensuring that they don't spread the disease, parents contribute to the "herd immunity" that protects the vulnerable.

Historical amnesia and individualism have contributed to a third cultural condition, one that is more obvious but also, perhaps, more central to measles' return and at least as worrying for society overall: diminished trust in government.

As Reich details, today's skepticism of vaccines has its roots in the alternative-medicine and self-help movements of the 1970s, which encouraged people to question established medical authority.

As distrust of government has grown, so too has distrust of vaccines. Anti-vaccination activists have enjoyed particular success in communities whose cultural isolation makes them easy prey for misinformation. In 2010 and 2011, Andrew Wakefield [lead author of the discredited 1998 paper in the British medical journal The Lancet that linked the MMR vaccine to autism] -- who now lives in the US -- reportedly visited the Somali community in Minnesota 3 times, and his supporters distributed pamphlets at community events. As of 2014, the local childhood MMR vaccination rate -- which had been 92 percent in 2004 -- had fallen to 42 percent. By 2017, children of Somali descent accounted for a majority of America's measles cases.

This year's [2019] measles outbreak [in NYC] appears to have started with people who traveled to Ukraine, where infection rates are high. Which points to a broader problem: Unvaccinated Americans face a growing risk of infection because vaccination rates are declining in Europe too, for largely the same reasons.

Stopping measles also requires empowering doctors. A 2011 Washington state law that required parents to talk with a doctor before getting a vaccine exemption reduced exemptions by 40 percent. And a 2012 study by researchers at Emory and Johns Hopkins found that parents who viewed their doctors as reliable sources of information were less likely to search for material about vaccines online. The problem, as Reich told me, is that pediatricians spend less time with patients than they did decades ago. Changing insurance companies' reimbursement practices to reward doctors for taking the time to reassure patients that vaccines are safe could push vaccination rates back up.

The implications of all of this go far beyond one disease. Although measles may be the most vivid medical manifestation of America's political and cultural ailments, it won't be the last. If Americans won't take expert advice about something as scientifically proven as the benefits of vaccinating their children, what other life-and-death advice will they ignore?

[11] HIV and measles vaccination
Date: Tue 9 Jul 2019
Source: Infectious Disease Advisor [abridged, edited]
https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/topics/hiv-aids/evidence-supports-measles-revaccination-in-hiv-infected-children/


Findings of a recently updated systematic review (1) support the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendation that children infected with HIV should be revaccinated against measles following immune reconstitution with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).

The review included 12 studies with a total of 3573 children (335 HIV-infected; 788 HEU [HIV-exposed but uninfected]; 1478 HUU [HIV-unexposed and uninfected]). "4 of the 12 studies found statistically significant reductions in seropositivity among HIV-infected children compared to HIV-uninfected children within 4 months of vaccination (prevalence ratio range: 0.44-0.70), and forest plots provided visual trends of decreasing immunity over time among HIV-infected children in 2 additional studies," the study authors reported.

Additionally, in the 9 studies which evaluated vaccine safety, there were no vaccine-related deaths or serious adverse events reported.

"Although the data are limited by small numbers, heterogeneity in study designs, and potential biases, the findings support the 2015 WHO recommendation to revaccinate HIV-infected children against measles following immune reconstitution with cART," the study authors concluded. They recommended additional studies in this patient population with longer follow-up periods.

According to the WHO, "measles in children with HIV infection is more often severe and results in higher mortality. Infants born to HIV-infected mothers are at higher risk for measles from 9 months of age.

Measles vaccines "should be given routinely to potentially susceptible, asymptomatic, HIV-infected children, adolescents and young adults. Only those with severe clinical symptoms of HIV infection are contraindicated for vaccination. These people often do not develop a protective immune response and are at increased risk of severe complications.

"Given the high risk of measles at 9 months of age, WHO recommends that infants infected with HIV receive an early dose of measles vaccine at 6 months of age, followed by a routine dose at 9 months (or according to the routine immunization schedule). Earlier age of vaccination is recommended because HIV-infected infants exhibit a better seroconversion rate at 6 months than at 9 months of age, possibly because of increasing HIV-associated immunodeficiency with age.

"HIV-infected infants vaccinated at 6 and 9 months should receive a 3rd measles vaccination (or 2nd opportunity) to prevent the proportion of unprotected children in the population from reaching dangerous levels. Recent studies suggest waning immunity among HIV-infected children, making this recommendation especially important in regions with high HIV prevalence."
