Two people have died from a disease that has the same symptoms as monkeypox; 12 cases have been reported in the past 2 weeks from the locality of Bangangala in Bomongo territory (Equatuer) [Equateur province, D.R.Congo]. People suffering from this disease have infections of the skin and mucous membranes. Parliamentary Deputy Patrick Mayombe, who provided the information to Radio Okapi on Thursday, [19 Jun 2014], requested the Government to make medical care available for these patients, who often resort to traditional treatments.

"I've called the Minister of Public Health. I even wrote him and I sent a copy [of the letter] to the Prime Minister and I expect the government to act quickly. Health centers do not have the required infrastructure to accommodate the sick and administer appropriate care, "said Patrick Mayombe.

In his opinion the government should urgently intervene to prevent an epidemic.

The MP also called specialists on the ground to request that people of this part of Equateur Province not to touch dead monkeys found in the forest.

Health specialists have not yet confirmed if it is really monkeypox.

Last October [2013], there were 9 cases including 1 death due to monkeypox in the Itipo health area sector Ekonda, Bikoro territory in Equateur province. Other cases of this disease were reported during the same period in the surrounding villages of Itipo-center and in the territory of Ingende.

[Rodents, such as rope squirrels, door mice and pouched rats, are the suspected reservoir hosts, with monkeys and humans as secondary, spill-over hosts. The monkeypox virus in the Congo has a higher case fatality rate than the virus in West Africa, where fatal cases are rare or absent. Monkeypox can infect humans and cause lesions clinically similar to those caused by smallpox virus. However, unlike smallpox virus, monkeypox virus is not efficiently transmitted from person to person. Chickenpox lesions can be confused with monkeypox disease by health care workers not familiar with the differences. It will be interesting to know the results of the laboratory tests when they become available.
