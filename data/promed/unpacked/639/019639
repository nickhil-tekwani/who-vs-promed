Pictou County vets are finding a large number of animals with ticks this year [2012]. Numerous have tested positive for Lyme disease, a tickborne illness.

Vet clinics throughout the county are reporting incidents of dogs with Lyme disease, an illness transmitted by black legged ticks, which are now known to populate various areas of the county.

Dr Brenda Spence-MacLeod of the Pictou Veterinary Clinic said she has had 2 confirmed cases this spring of dogs with Lyme disease with the most recent confirmation arriving just last week [week of 21 May 2012].

Like many other clinics in the county, she is seeing more canines coming in with ticks and tick bites, which are something that people in this area had never had to think about in the past. Even last year [2011], she said she didn't see it as much of a problem.

"I am more concerned about it this year," she said. She said that there are a lot of dogs who aren't tested who could also be carrying the disease, but just aren't showing clinical signs.

Dr Kathryn Finlayson of the East River Animal Hospital said she's tested about 50 dogs over the last year with 5 coming back positive for Lyme disease. She was able to successfully treat 4 while the 5th had to be euthanized.

"Every day we get ticks coming in from pets from all over," she said. The ones that tested positive ranged from Abercrombie to Merigomish, she said.

Not all ticks carry Lyme disease and even those that do won't transmit the disease until they engorged, which can take up to 48 hours, but because of the presence of the black-legged ticks in the area, she like other vets has been recommending that pet owners vaccinate their dogs. While the vaccine doesn't prevent dogs from getting bit by ticks it does greatly reduce the likelihood of them getting Lyme disease. There are also medications available for dogs that repel ticks and will kill them if they bite.

Vets caution that medication is toxic to cats though and people who own both dogs and cats should be careful to keep their dogs away from their cats when they're being treated.

While ticks can be out any time of year, Finlayson said we are heading into peak season and people should be sure to be checking their pets.

Abercrombie Animal Hospital Veterinarian Dr Kelly Hodder said they've had 2 dogs that have tested positive for Lyme in the past year as well and seen numerous other animals who have picked up ticks. While she's seen some on cats, it's more common on dogs and the chances of getting bitten vary to an extent with geography.

She and Dr Finlayson both said that cats tend to be better groomers than dogs, which may be one reason why they aren't as susceptible to ticks. Dogs that have been infected with Lyme disease may show signs of lameness for no apparent reason, fatigue, or depression among other signs.

If you do find a tick on your pet you can remove it with a pair of tweezers and turning counter clockwise as you pull. If for some reason part of the tick remains, vets recommend scrubbing the area with soapy water. Hodder said people should be careful not to touch the tick with the bare hands.

New Glasgow resident Brenda Sterling-Goodwin believes she contracted Lyme disease while she was working at a vet clinic and she said people need to be more aware about the disease and how common it is in this area.

[Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium _Borrelia burgdorferi_ and is spread by ticks. Ticks become infected with the bacteria by feeding on infected mice and other small animals. When an infected tick bites other animals, it can transmit the bacteria to these animals. The deer tick is small and may bite animals and people without being detected.

Lyme disease affects a variety of species, including dogs, cats, and people. Up to 95 percent of dogs infected with _B. burgdorferi_ do not develop clinical signs (people are much more likely to become ill with Lyme disease). There is no evidence that Lyme disease is spread by direct contact with infected animals. However, ticks can hitch a ride home on your pets and move on to the humans in the household.

Dogs spending a lot of time outdoors, especially in the woods, bush, or areas of tall grass are most commonly infected with Lyme disease. However, ticks can be carried into yards on other animals, and dogs can become infected anywhere ticks are found.

Infections occur during tick season which is usually spring through early fall, but the time between infection and the appearance of clinical signs of Lyme disease can be up to 2-5 months.

When signs do develop, they may be transient or recurrent, and may include: fever, decreased appetite or lack of appetite (anorexia), swollen, painful joints making the dog reluctant to move, lameness -- limping which may be mild at first, then worsen, and may also shift from one leg to another, lethargy, and swollen lymph nodes.

Some dogs with Lyme disease may develop kidney disease. Signs can include depression, vomiting, loss of appetite, and increased thirst and urination (sometimes a lack of urination will develop). Dogs developing kidney disease can become very ill and may not respond to treatment.

Neurological disease (behavioral changes, seizures) and heart complications, which are sometimes seen in humans, are rare in dogs.

The diagnosis of Lyme disease must be based on a combination of factors, including history (tick exposure; occasionally exposure may be missed), clinical signs, finding antibodies to _B. burgdorferi_ bacteria, and a quick response to treatment with antibiotics. A positive antibody test is not enough to make a diagnosis on its own, because not all dogs that are exposed to _B. burgdorferi_ get sick, and antibodies can persist in the blood for a long time after exposure.

Other diagnostic tests such as blood and urine tests, may be done to check for signs of kidney disease and to rule out other conditions with similar signs. Additional tests may include x-rays and sampling of joint fluid.

Treatment with antibiotics usually produces a rapid improvement in signs. Antibiotics generally need to be continued for several weeks. Treatment may not completely clear the bacteria, but produces a state where no signs are present.

If kidney disease is present, a longer course of antibiotics along with additional medications to treat the kidney disease is usually necessary.

Kidney disease may develop some time after the initial infection, so it is a good idea to regularly visit your veterinarian to check for excess protein in the urine of dogs that have had Lyme disease. Catching the kidney disease early in its course offers the best prognosis.

Tick control is extremely important for the prevention of Lyme disease and other diseases transmitted by ticks. Check your dog daily for ticks and remove them as soon as possible, since ticks must feed for at least 12 hours and maybe as long as 24-48 hours before transmitting the bacteria causing Lyme disease. This is especially important in peak tick season and after your dog spends time in the bush or tall grass areas, which you may want to avoid in tick season.

Products that prevent ticks such as monthly parasite preventatives (for example, Frontline(R), Revolution(R)) or tick collars (for example, Preventic(R)) can be used. Be sure to follow your veterinarian's advice when using these products. Keep grass and brush trimmed in your yard, and in areas where ticks are a serious problem, you can also consider treating your yard for ticks.

There are excellent vaccines available but some people are reluctant to use them because the disease is relatively easy to treat.

Vaccination before exposure can help prevent dogs from getting Lyme disease and also prevent them from becoming carriers of the bacteria. Where vaccines are used, it is usually recommended to start vaccinating dogs as young puppies, by 12 weeks, with a booster 2-4 weeks later. The vaccine does not provide long lasting immunity, so annual revaccination prior to tick season is necessary. The recombinant form of the vaccine is considered to have less potential for side effects than the bacterin forms of the vaccine.

Risk, vaccination, and health issues related to Lyme disease and your area should be discussed with your veterinarian. It is tick season so please discuss this before your pet is affected.
