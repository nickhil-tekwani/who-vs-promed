Taiwan: Record Number of Dengue Fever Cases in 2002
---------------------------------------------------
There has been a record number of dengue fever cases this year, 5227,
but the disease may not be eradicated in the south anytime soon, and
new cases can also be expected. Outbreaks of dengue fever may take
place any time throughout the year in Taiwan and could plague the
island even without imported cases, the Center for Disease Control
(CDC) warned yesterday. At a public hearing entitled "Dengue fever
prevention policy and measures" held at the CDC, Chen Tsai-ching, CDC
director-general, said the epidemic may not be wiped out in southern
Taiwan this winter. "Dengue fever cases may continue to appear in
Kaohsiung and Pingtung although it is already winter now," Chen said.
Chen said that the outbreaks of dengue fever in Taiwan over the past
few years [have been caused by] dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2). "But I
am worried multiple dengue fever serotypes will appear because we
have imported cases every year," he said. This year, the number of
dengue fever cases in Taiwan has hit a record high of 5227. "If we
fail to control the epidemic this winter, next year's dengue fever
outbreaks will get worse," Chen said. According to the CDC, 4747
cases were reported in Kaohsiung, while 351 cases were reported in
Pingtung and 64 in Tainan.
Chen said that this year's dengue outbreaks were similar to those in
1988. "One cause of the 1988 outbreak was that the temperatures in
January and February that year did not drop lower than 11 degrees
Celsius," Chen added. Yang Shih-yang, director of the CDC's Division
of Laboratory Resources Management, said the CDC had confirmed
Taiwan's dengue fever outbreaks over the past 2 years were both
initiated by local cases. "This year, in Kaohsiung alone, we have
sprayed 20 tons of insecticide," Yang said. But Yang noted that
spraying insecticide was not an effective way to control the
epidemic. The most important approach to control dengue fever is to
control the population of larvae by cleaning water containers, Yang
said. "The cooperation of wardens and village chiefs is helpful. If
they can persuade residents in their communities to clean water
containers on their own, it could be very effective in controlling
the epidemic," Yang said. He said the CDC is considering inviting
Master Cheng Yen, founder of the Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu
Chi Foundation, to persuade the public to clean their water
containers. "We want to ask Master Cheng Yen to tell people that if
they can clean their water containers, then the CDC will not need to
take so many [mosquito] lives every year. Killing mosquitoes is an
act of taking lives," Yang said.
