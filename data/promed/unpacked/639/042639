A flight attendant for EVA Airways was confirmed [Wed 5 Apr 2017] as being infected with measles, and is known to have had contact with 170 people during the incubation period, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

CDC deputy director-general Philip Lo said the patient, in her 20s, served in the elite class of EVA Flight B62 that departed from Vienna for Bangkok from last Wednesday to [Thu 6 Apr 2017], and then in the elite class of Flight BR212 that departed from Thailand for Taiwan last [Fri 7 Apr 2017]. During the incubation period, the patient had visited France, Singapore, Beijing and Hangzhou in China, and Bangkok, Lo said.

CDC has identified the 170 contacts, including her family members, passengers and colleagues on the same flights, as well as health care personnel and patients that she came into contact with when she sought medical attention on [Mon 10 Apr 2017].

Measures are being taken to monitor if the infection is spreading or not, Lo said, urging passengers on those flights to conduct self-health management for 18 days. The health monitoring is recommended until April 24 [2017] for those who took the flight last Wednesday and Thursday (5--6 Apr 2017), CDC said.

EVA Air said other flight attendants on the same flights as the patient have also been asked to conduct self-health management. None of them has developed any symptoms so far, the company said.

According to CDC data, the flight attendant developed a fever and oral herpes last [Sat 8 Apr 2017], and a rash over her body the next day. On [Mon 10 Apr 2017], she sought medical attention at a hospital, which then collected specimens from her for laboratory testing and requested that she conduct home quarantine. On [Wed 12 Apr 2017], the patient was confirmed to have been infected with measles, making her the 5th case this year [2017].

All 5 cases were imported and determined to have been contracted in China, Indonesia, Europe and Thailand, respectively, CDC said, noting that the number of cases is the highest for April over the past 3 years.

CDC has issued a measles travel notice categorized as "watch" for 11 countries -- China, Indonesia, Thailand, India, Kazakhstan, Romania, Italy, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. The agency advised people planning to travel to those countries to get inoculated beforehand.

Up to 2 cases of measles in Minnesota may not sound like much to worry about, but there's a big question mark in this investigation: What is the source? Without knowing that, it's hard to know how many more cases could develop. While 2 children are being treated, public health workers are on the phone notifying anyone who may have been exposed to the highly contagious disease.

"Then it's a lot more boots on the ground kind of work to identify who might have been exposed, but that's the work of public health," said Kris Ehresmann of the Infectious Disease division of the Minnesota Department of Health. There is a connection between the 2 infected children, but neither child has traveled outside the country. This means that investigators don't know the source, so the search is on, with workers trying to prevent any kind of mass outbreak.

"While many people develop measles and it's moderate to severe, there are individuals who are hospitalized who can develop severe pneumonia," said Ehresmann. "We do see deaths from measles."

In Minnesota, 94 per cent of kindergartners have had the MMR vaccine, but it's those who have not had it that are at the greatest risk. The classic symptom is a rash, but the very 1st symptoms are actually cough, runny nose and watery eyes - symptoms easily mistaken for a cold or allergy. You are infectious for 4 days with these seemingly minor symptoms. Between that and not knowing the source of these latest 2 cases, there is cause for concern. "So I think it's important for people to realize that we have 2 cases now, we do expect that we will likely see more cases of measles, and that will not be surprising to us," Ehresmann said.

Measles was declared eliminated in the US back in 2000, which means the cases that we do have are brought in from other countries. Right now, Europe is having a major measles outbreak, so traveling there unvaccinated could be risky.

Minnesota health officials are investigating 3 cases of measles in Hennepin County in an effort to identify the source of the infections and determine if others have been exposed. So far investigators have confirmed measles in 3 toddlers in Hennepin County, according to the Minnesota Department of Health. Like most new cases in the US, the infected children were not vaccinated against the disease.

Local and state public health departments "are following up on other potential cases associated with the confirmed illnesses," the department said [Thu 13 Apr 2017] afternoon.

Measles was declared to be officially eradicated in the US in 2000, but international travelers who have been exposed in foreign countries can spark new infections here when they come in contact with someone who doesn't have immunity. Minnesota sees a small number of cases each year -- in the past 4 years there were just 2 cases annually. But in 2011, a small outbreak resulted in 26 cases. All were imported or were linked to foreign travel.

[4] Bhutan transboundary infection
Date: Tue 11 Apr 2017
Source: Kuensel [edited]
http://www.kuenselonline.com/trans-boundary-infections-threaten-measles-elimination-target/


Trans-boundary infections present serious challenges for the country to maintain its target to eliminate measles by the end of next year [2018], say health officials. Bhutan did not have any measles cases in 2013 and 2014. However, there was a measles outbreak in a school in Merak in Trashigang, last year [2016].

Deputy chief programme officer with the vaccine preventable disease programme, Tshewang Tamang, said that in the case of the Merak outbreak, most of the infected were not vaccinated. He pointed out that people did not come for vaccination because the health setting in the area was inadequate. Another reason attributed for the lack of vaccinations was that people moved around frequently while herding their animals which limited the effectiveness of their awareness campaigns. "In response to the Merak outbreak, we did an awareness campaign in the area," he said. "Measles vaccinations are available in all the health centers including Basic Health Units (BHUs) in the villages now."

Measles is a highly contagious disease and the WHO South-East Asia Regional Office has set a measles elimination target by 2020. In line with that Bhutan has set up its own target to eliminate measles by 2018.

Of a total of 45 measles cases from Paro, Samtse, Sarpang, Thimphu, Trashigang and Wangdue last year [2016], 33 were reported from Trashigang alone. In 2015, some 11 measles cases were reported from Samtse, Paro, Sarpang, Phuentsholing and Thimphu. The ministry investigated the measles cases in 2015 and 2016.

Tshewang Tamang said that based on the investigation and genotype of the measles, it is confirmed that the cases are imported. He said that WHO's definition of elimination of measles means zero indigenous cases in a country. "As of now, nothing can be said if Bhutan can achieve its target by next year [2018]." Meanwhile, some 16 measles cases were reported from Samtse, Phuentsholing and Thimphu till date this year [2017].

Tshewang Tamang said that the investigation report on genotype of measles reported this year [2017] was sent to Bangkok in Thailand. The ministry is yet to get confirmation on whether the reported cases are imported or indigenous. "It is likely to be importation because the outbreak started from Samtse and Phuentsholing, the dzongkhags that share a border with the neighbouring country," he added.

The measles vaccination programme was 1st introduced in the country in 1979 where toddlers were vaccinated at 9 months. The 2nd dose of measles vaccination for children at 24 months was started in 2006. Tshewang Tamang also pointed out that some measles cases are seen in children below 9 months. "If the vaccine is given to a child before he or she reaches 9 months, the effect of the vaccine is only about 65 per cent," he said. The efficacy of the 1st vaccine dose given to a child at 9 months is 85 per cent. Not all infants given the vaccine at 9 months are guaranteed to be immunized from measles. Tshewang Tamang said that to protect the remaining 15 per cent, the 2nd dose of the measles vaccine is given at 24 months. The efficacy of the 2nd dose is 95 per cent.

In Bhutan, the measles vaccine is given in the form of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR vaccine). Tshewang Tamang said that it is mandatory for a child to get both the dosages. Unvaccinated young children are at a higher risk of getting measles and suffering complications. Any non-immune person who has not been vaccinated or was vaccinated but did not develop immunity can become infected.

Measles is easily spread by coughing, sneezing and close contact with those already infected. The symptoms of the disease are fever, cough, red eyes, muscle aches, runny nose, white spots inside the mouth and rash, for any age. Tamang pointed out that complications with measles are high with diarrhea and pneumonia at times leading to death. He said that there is no specific treatment for measles. It is prevented by the measles vaccination given at 9 and 24 months after birth. "Anyone with fever and rash should visit nearest health center," he said. "Measles is confirmed only by a laboratory testing."

In an effort to achieve its target to eliminate measles in the region by 2020, WHO recommended countries to carry out a nationwide awareness campaign on measles. However, Tshewang Tamang said that it is expensive for the ministry to conduct a nationwide campaign. The ministry will be campaigning in high-risk areas where the terrain is challenging like Merak and the border areas to increase the immunity level of the population against measles. "We will focus on labor camps and low immunization coverage areas in the country identified by the dzongkhags" [an administrative and judicial district of Bhutan. - Mod.LK]. He said that the campaigns will target people up to the age of 40 years, assuming that they are exposed to the measles virus because measles cases were reported by people aged between 30 and 45 in 2016.

According to WHO, there were 134 200 deaths caused by measles globally in 2015, which means about 367 deaths daily or 15 deaths every hour. The vaccinations resulted in a 79 per cent drop in deaths caused by measles between 2000 and 2015.

[5] Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis
Date: Wed 12 Apr 2017
Source: Healio Infectious Disease News [edited]
http://bit.ly/2oDOn5G


Researchers reported that the incidence of a rare but fatal measles complication known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, or SSPE, in unvaccinated children may be higher than previously thought, with as many as one in 609 infants infected with measles before 1 year of age being affected by the condition.

The findings, which were recently published in Clinical Infectious Diseases [see citation below] and initially presented at IDWeek 2016, demonstrate "the potentially high human cost of 'natural' measles immunity," James D Cherry, distinguished professor of pediatrics and infectious diseases at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, and colleagues wrote.

According to the researchers, SSPE is a "devastating condition" that causes cognitive and motor deterioration, with death usually occurring 1 to 3 years after symptom onset. Previously, the rate of SSPE was estimated to be 1 in 100 000 people in developed countries but 100 times higher in some developing regions. More recent estimates showed that SSPE occurred in 1 in 5560 children infected with measles before 1 year of age in England and Wales, and 1 in 1700 children infected before 5 years of age in Germany.

To determine the incidence of SSPE in California, Cherry and colleagues reviewed state death certificates, CDC reports and information on investigations regarding undiagnosed neurologic diseases. They identified 17 cases of SSPE that occurred from 1998 to 2015 among children who were infected with measles before vaccination. Among them, 12 developed measles or a compatible febrile rash illness by 15 months of age before developing SSPE.

The average age at SSPE diagnosis was 12 years (range 3--35 years), with a latency period of 9.5 years (range, 2.5--34). Most patients reportedly had long-standing cognitive or motor problems that may have been early symptoms of SSPE, the researchers noted. However, they all eventually developed cognitive and motor decline. Based on available information, 10 patients had died and only one who was born in 2011 is known to be alive.

Additional investigations revealed that 7 children were exposed to measles in California during a resurgence between 1988 and 1991, when more than 9500 cases were reported in children younger than 5 years of age. During this time, the rate of SSPE was estimated to be one in 1367 among children infected with measles before 5 years of age, and one in 609 infants infected before 1 year of age. According to the researchers, the data underscore the importance of vaccination and herd immunity with the measles-mumps-rubella [MMR] vaccine.

"Because measles can be introduced into the US at any time, reducing the risk of measles and subsequent SSPE for US infants requires sustaining high levels of immunization domestically while continuing efforts to eliminate the disease where it is still endemic," they wrote. "As long as measles continues to circulate in the world, measles infection can occur in unvaccinated infants who have an elevated risk of SSPE."
In a related editorial, James L Goodson, epidemiologist at CDC, and colleagues noted that since the current investigation was facilitated by the implementation of enhanced surveillance methods, the findings represent "a more accurate estimate" of SSPE incidence than previous studies have indicated.

"It appears that the previous estimates were too conservative, and that characterization of SSPE as being a rare complication of measles should be reconsidered," Goodson and colleagues wrote. "Therefore, in addition to the prevention of complications including fatal outcomes that can result from acute measles, prevention of SSPE might be considered as an advocacy tool to help global vaccination programs achieve the high vaccination coverage needed to protect vulnerable infants. Furthermore, recommendations for the administration of measles vaccine as early as 6 months of age should be followed to prevent measles and complications in settings or outbreaks in which infants are at high risk for exposure to measles virus."

[Epidemiological data are consistent with a directly protective effect of MMR vaccine against SSPE mediated by preventing measles. Where there has been effective measles control through vaccination, a decline in new SSPE cases is observed a few years after the decline in measles incidence. The resurgence of measles in the US has resulted in a high rate of SSPE among unvaccinated children, highlighting the importance of measles prevention. Frequently undiagnosed, SSPE is characterized by cognitive and motor deterioration, commonly resulting in mortality within 1-3 y of symptom onset, and overwhelmingly in infants under 15 months of age. - Mod.LK]

An additional case of measles has been confirmed on the province's south shore, requiring notification to parents and guardians of students at Hebbville Academy. The current outbreak of measles now has 15 confirmed cases; one other case was identified since last public release on [Tue 4 Apr 2017].

"We are currently investigating this particular measles case to determine how it is linked with the other cases of measles we've been managing the past few weeks," said Dr Ryan Sommers, medical officer of health. "The person in this case, a student, attends Hebbville Academy and we have notified parents/guardians, students and staff at the school."

Dr Sommers notes that due to the large number of potential exposures in the school environment, Public Health decided to host a vaccination clinic for students and staff whose vaccination for measles is not up to date. "This clinic will ideally help us prevent additional cases of measles and ensure that those whose vaccinations weren't up to date are covered. While we may see other cases due to this exposure, this vaccination clinic along with our investigation should greatly reduce those numbers." Risk to the general public remains low at this time and most people are protected from measles infection by being vaccinated. Public Health is once again asking the public to be aware of measles symptoms and what to do if they have them.

Measles is a viral illness and most people fully recover within 2--3 weeks. However, measles can have serious complications, which are more likely in infants, pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems. Public Health has been directly notifying others, such as family members and friends, who are known to have had close contact with a case.

So far in 2017:
- there have been 2 measles outbreaks;
- the 1st was in January/February, with 7 cases;
- the 2nd, and current outbreak, started in March and has 15 cases; an additional case was identified since the last public release on [Tue 4 Apr 2017];
- the total of measles cases in Nova Scotia is 22.

Nova Scotia residents born after 1970 are eligible to receive 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine at no cost through the publicly funded immunization program. Individuals who have not had 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine should arrange immunization through their primary care provider as per the NS Immunization Schedule.
