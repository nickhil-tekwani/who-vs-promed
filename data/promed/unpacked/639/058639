In part [1] of the previous posting "Rabies (28): Americas (USA) cattle, imported dogs 20190511.6465671," it was reported that this event took place in Wyoming. In actuality, it occurred in the state of Colorado.

Apologies to the state of Wyoming and to our readers.

Larimer county, Colorado is wise to recommend livestock be vaccinated.
