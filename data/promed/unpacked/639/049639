For the 1st time, Q-fever has been detected on a dairy sheep farm.
The infected farm, in Kraggenburg (Flevoland), includes about 150
pregnant sheep, which are to be killed today [Mon 25 Jan 2010].

Previous infections were detected in 63 dairy goat holdings, where a
total of 37 000 pregnant animals have been culled. The situation on
sheep farms (both dairy and mutton flocks) is to be discussed on
Wednesday [27 Jan 2010] in an emergency debate in the House with
Ministers Verburg (Agriculture) and Klink (Public Health).

Earlier this week, it was suggested by MD Ronald Schegget of the
Public Health Service in Southeast Brabant that there is a linkage
between 46 human cases of Q fever in Nuenen and the 12 000 visitors
to the lamb-viewing days at a (mutton-type) sheep farm in Nuenen.

Ahead of the parliamentary debate, the ministers will clarify their
policy concerning measures against Q fever on sheep farms in a letter
addressed to the House. So far, bulk-milk tests were the mode upon
which actions on [dairy] sheep farms were determined. Mutton-sheep
have not been addressed so far [in relation to the current Q fever epidemic].

In the due emergency debate, the VVD party (Dutch liberal party) will
argue for a parliamentary investigation into the control of Q-fever.
According to the VVD, the inquiry set up [see 20100112.0144] has no
access to the cabinet's files. Various research reports and other
documents have shown that the Q fever bacteria were found already in
2005 on goat farms in the south of the country, but their locations
have remained secret.

In 2007, the disease was found for the 1st time in humans. Only at
the end of 2009, the government decided to adopt drastic control
measures. According to the Ministry of Public Health and The National
Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), 6 out of the
almost 3600 Q fever patients have died.

The physician-microbiologist Peter Wever (Jeroen Bosch Hospital) has,
following his survey covering 12 hospitals, counted at least 11
fatalities. "Our reported 6 fatalities might be an underestimate. We
depend upon notifications from the Public Health Service, which
report all disease cases but not all fatalities," acknowledges the
spokesperson of RIVM.

[The nomination of the investigation committee of the Q fever (Qf)
epidemic by ministers Verborg (Agriculture) and Klink (Public health)
was completed on 20 Jan 2010. In addition to the chairman, Prof. Dr.
Ing. G. van Dijk, nominated 11 Jan 2010, the committee will include
the following 6 members: Prof. Dr. J. Van der Meer,
internist-infectiologist, St. Radboud hospital, Nijmegen (human
health); Prof. Dr. P. Speelman, internist-infectiologist, Academic
Medical Centre - AMC, Amsterdam (human health); Prof. Dr. J.A.
Stegeman, professor of healthcare food animals, Faculty of Veterinary
Medicine, Utrecht University (veterinary health); Dr. P. Vanthemsche,
former Head of The Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain
(FASFC), Belgium (Veterinary health); Prof. Dr. J. de Vries,
Scientific Director, Leiden University College The Hague (Public
Administration) and Prof. Dr. C.M.J. van Woerkum, Professor of
Communications, Wageningen University and Research Centre. The
committee was requested to complete its report before the 2010 summer
recess of the Parliament.

Q fever in sheep and goats has become officially notifiable in the
Netherlands since 2006. According to OIE's WAHID interface, this
disease is still not notifiable in several European countries such as
Belgium, Finland, France, Portugal and the UK, as well as in most of
the world's countries, including Australia, the "cradle" of Qf, and
Canada, where massive outbreaks in goats have been recorded in the
past. Declaring a disease as notifiable is the inevitable,
prerequisite step required to regulate and implement official disease
control or preventive measures. Q fever in cattle is not yet
notifiable in the Netherlands.

An example of another zoonotic disease which causes abortions in
small ruminants and a serious disease in humans (Malta fever) is
brucellosis (caused, in sheep and goats, by the bacterium _Brucella
melitensis_). This disease is notifiable in most countries.

It will be interesting to follow the deliberations and testimonies of
the Dutch investigation committee(s); their conclusions and
recommendations may have an impact upon Dutch policy and regulations
and also elsewhere within and outside Europe. - Mod.AS]
