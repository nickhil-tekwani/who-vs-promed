Highly pathogenic avian influenza, USA
--------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 19 Dec 2014 from Dr John Clifford, deputy administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, USA

Summary
Report type: follow-up report No. 1
Date of start of the event: 10 Dec 2014
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 14 Dec 2014
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 2004
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N8
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Douglas County, Douglas, Oregon
Date of start of the outbreak: 16 Dec 2014
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: backyard
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 130 / 28 / 28 / 0 / 0
Affected population: The affected premises are a small backyard mixed flock of guinea fowl, chickens, ducks, and geese that are allowed access to the outdoors and regularly exposed to wild migratory waterfowl. The affected backyard flock was placed under quarantine.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 21.5 / 21.5 / 100 / 21.5
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species

Epidemiological comment: The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) and the Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA) are conducting a comprehensive investigation of this outbreak. The USDA APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) confirmed avian influenza virus (AIV) H5N8 via sequencing directly from swab samples. Preliminary results indicate the HA sequence is 99.3 per cent similar to A/bean goose/Korea/H40/2014 (H5N8 HPAI) based on a partial fragment of the HA gene. The neuraminidase sequence is 99.7 per cent similar to A/Baikal teal/Korea/H80/2014 (H5N8) based on a partial fragment of the NA gene. The amino acid sequence at the hemagglutinin cleavage site is consistent with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Whole genome sequencing is in progress. Enhanced surveillance by the USDA APHIS and ODA is being initiated. The H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in Oregon is limited to a small backyard poultry premises only and does not involve commercial poultry.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: stamping out; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Birds / real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 18 Dec 2014 / Positive
Birds / virus sequencing / 18 Dec 2014 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The finding in Douglas County, Oregon, was quickly reported and identified due to increased surveillance for avian influenza in light of the HPAI H5N2 affecting commercial poultry in British Columbia, Canada, and the detection of HPAI in wild birds in Washington State. The H5N8 virus found in this backyard flock is the same virus that was found in the Washington State gyrfalcons.

While the United States is likely to be working with its trading partners to minimize trade impacts on poultry commodities, countries should respond to this reported detection according to OIE's science-based standards. Given that only backyard poultry were affected, that commercial production operations have heightened their state of alert, tightened their biosecurity, and increased their surveillance activities, there would be little justification in prohibiting poultry and poultry commodities from US integrated operations. - Mod.CRD
