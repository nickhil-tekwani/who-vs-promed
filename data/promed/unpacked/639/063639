French health officials have confirmed 50 cases of enterohemorrhagic _Escherichia coli_ (EHEC) linked to a type of Nestlé frozen pizza. Of these infections, 48 were caused by _E. coli_ O26 and 2 by _E. coli_ O103, according to Santé Publique France, the French public health agency. Another 25 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and EHEC infections are still being investigated. HUS is a type of kidney failure associated with certain _E. coli_ infections that can result in lifelong, serious health problems and death.

Buitoni brand Fraîch'Up pizzas sold since June 2021 were withdrawn and recalled in mid-March 2022 after Nestlé was warned about the potential presence of _E. coli_ O26 in dough used to make them. Of the 50 patients, 48 are children and 2 are adults. They fell ill between 18 Jan 2022 and 14 Mar 2022. The 2 adults are over 90 years of age, with one having developed HUS. The sick children are between 1 and 17 years old with a median age of 7. Twenty are females and 28 are males. Two children died, but it is not known if they ate the pizzas and their deaths are under investigation.

Eleven patients live in Hauts-de-France, 8 in Nouvelle Aquitaine, 7 in Pays de la Loire, 6 in Bretagne and Ile-de-France, 3 in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, 2 each in Bourgogne Franche-Comté, Grand Est, Occitanie and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur and 1 in Centre Val-de-Loire.

Buitoni has suspended production and said it will not restart until the cause of the contamination has been identified so that the necessary corrective measures can be taken. French media reported local officials blocked pizza production at the factory in Caudry since the start of April 2022 based on findings from 2 inspections. Authorities have also opened an investigation into the incident. Santé Publique France, the Directorate General for Food (DGAL), Directorate General for Competition, Consumption and the Repression of Fraud (DGCCRF), and Directorate General for Health are continuing epidemiological, microbiological and traceability work.

Consumers who purchased Fraîch'Up frozen pizzas have been advised not to eat them and throw them away. Expiry dates range from 1 Jun 2022 to 31 Mar 2023. Distribution includes at least 20 countries, mainly in Africa, but also Slovenia, Belgium and Luxembourg.

[The serotypes involved in this large outbreak with a prominent number of HUS cases is now reported to be O26 with a few O103. Since HUS generally occurs in less than 10% of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ cases, the total number of infections is likely to be at least 10 times higher. The following is a good basic review on HUS:
Joseph A, Aurélie A, Kurkdjian PM, et al. Shiga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome: a narrative review. Toxins (Basel). 2020; 12(2): 67; https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins12020067
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
"The severity of human infection by one of the many Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) is determined by a number of factors: the bacterial genome, the capacity of human societies to prevent foodborne epidemics, the medical condition of infected patients (in particular their hydration status, often compromised by severe diarrhea), and by our capacity to devise new therapeutic approaches, most specifically to combat the bacterial virulence factors, as opposed to our current strategies that essentially aim to palliate organ deficiencies. The last major outbreak in 2011 in Germany, which killed more than 50 people in Europe, was evidence that an effective treatment was still lacking. Herein, we review the current knowledge of STEC virulence, how societies organize the prevention of human disease, and how physicians treat (and, hopefully, will treat) its potentially fatal complications. In particular, we focus on STEC-induced hemolytic and uremic syndrome (HUS), where the intrusion of toxins inside endothelial cells results in massive cell death, activation of the coagulation within capillaries, and eventually organ failure."

Flour is an uncommon but reported vehicle for the transmission of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ of a variety of serotypes. The serotype is not specifically mentioned here. Since dough made from flour is generally eaten fully cooked, most episodes seemed to have been linked to ingestion of uncooked or undercooked dough. It is possible that kitchen contamination with the EHEC occurred before the cooking of the frozen pizza. - Mod.LL
