[The above article is rather hazy. The information on "huge losses of
cattle heads" and "sudden outbreak of livestock diseases in different
villages of Badin... owing to consumption of contaminated water of
ponds" which led to "emergency survey" and the vaccination of "around
8000 livestock... to control these diseases", is in need of
clarification. What were the findings of the emergency survey? How
many heads of cattle died -- and what was the denominator? What kind
of contamination involved? Which livestock species affected? Which
diseases(s) suspected -- and what vaccines used?

Badin is situated in southern Sindh; see map at
