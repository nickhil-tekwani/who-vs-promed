The number of cattle killed by anthrax has climbed to 37 on 10 properties
following a further case at a Wyuna farm on the weekend.
DPI [Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries] has vaccinated about
29 000 head of cattle in the Stanhope, Tatura, and Wyuna districts, and
senior DPI vet George Miller [sic] said there were about 4000 more to go.
"Those remaining are the last few we have not yet been able to get to
because property owners have not been available or for some other reason,"
Dr Miller said.

[It is not clear but this suggests that there has been a 2nd outbreak in
Wyuna. A previous report on 20 Feb 2007 referred to 35 animals,
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/items/200702/1852209.htm?goulburnmurray>, and
added little, but included a statement by George Miller/Hugh Millar, which
was revealing; "But we think the fact that it's a drought and they're
eating more soil than usual and this year [2007] we're getting these
thunderstorms and perhaps days of high humidity and light rain falls may be
aiding and abetting it, we don't know for sure."
This is something we have seen elsewhere -- brief showers preceding anthrax
outbreaks in otherwise very hot and dry summers. What I think happens is
that the shower initiates a sudden grass spurt when the grazing has been
taken right down to be very short and next to the soil. Besides suddenly
providing some grazing, the rain softens the ground and will collect where
there are shallow depressions and thus, provide longer grazing and soil
consumption by grazing animals, cattle especially. Such depressions have a
tradition of attracting anthrax cases and thus, spores. We have found in
our Texas studies that these depressions collect calcium, have high pHs and
have more organic humus than surrounding areas ... all of which favour
spore survival. - Mod.MHJ]
