[The reporting of 9 newly confirmed cases in a single day after a period of relative calmness was an eye opener today. It still is hard to understand how Saudi Arabia continues to have sporadic and contact cases while the other countries that have had documented MERS-CoV infections acquired presumably within their countries have not. One can't help but wonder why... Is this a reflection of "seek and ye shall find" and Saudi Arabia, having had a number of nosocomial outbreaks, is seeking and finding, or is there something inherently different culturally within the countries that has individuals residing within Saudi Arabia at greater risk of exposure to the virus than those in other countries?

To quote the summary information provided on the MOH website today [11 May 2015]: "In the last 24 hours, 9 MERS-CoV cases were confirmed. Four of them were household contacts of a known case in Hofuf city. In addition, 4 sporadic cases were reported from 4 different hospitals in Riyadh, and one case was a hospital-acquired case from Taif." Of note, all 4 of the household contacts in Hofuf were reported to be symptomatic, so these are known secondary clinical cases of MERS-CoV associated illness. The most recent reported cases from Hofuf (Hafoof) were a 39-year-old male reported by the MOH on 5 May 2015 and a 61-year-old male reported by the MOH on 20 Apr 2014 (while the incubation period is considered to be a maximum of 14 days, in the absence of knowing the actual dates of contact and dates of onset of illness of the contacts, this latter case could be the household contact of these additional cases, albeit less likely).

With respect to the hospital acquired infection in Taif, there was a 48-year-old male reported by the MOH on 9 May 2015 who is most likely the source patient for the hospital acquired case.

As for the 4 sporadic cases reported from 4 different hospitals in Riyadh, it will be interesting to learn whether there were other high risk exposures identified, such as contact with camels or raw camel products (milk, urine or undercooked meat), or whether there were potential healthcare environment exposures by virtue of the need for medical care due to pre-existing co-morbidities that might be identified through more detailed investigations following the initial reports.

As of today [11 May 2015], this brings the total number of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia to 996, approaching the 1000 mark.
