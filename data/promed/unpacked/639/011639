The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human services issued a health alert Friday night [25 Feb 2016] warning health care providers of a mumps outbreak at a New Hampshire college campus.

State epidemiologist Dr Ben Chan said the outbreak is at St Anselm College in Goffstown.

According to the health alert the New Hampshire Division of Public Health Services has confirmed 2 cases in a lab and identified 3 other probable cases.

All the patients are members of the men's college hockey team and all had received prior vaccinations.

Officials say the vaccinations are considered 88 percent effective after a 2-dose series.

The Division of Public Health Services is conducting a contact investigation but said the timing of this outbreak coinciding with St Anselm's spring break [27 Feb-5 Mar 2016] will make things difficult as students prepare to travel.

This could aid in the spread of the virus by potentially exposing other people across the state or the country.

Officials say health care providers should notify the Division of Public Health Services about any patient presenting signs and symptoms consistent with mumps, especially if they have been in contact with anyone from the college.
