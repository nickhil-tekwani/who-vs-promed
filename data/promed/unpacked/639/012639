Fourteen days ago he was working in the field in Charagua and La Peña, 310
km and 28 km respectively from Santa Cruz, respectively.
Hemorrhagic manifestations observed were scattered petequiae (pinpoint
small hemorrhages from small capillaries seen on the skin) on limbs,
bleeding gums and a positive tourniquet test. No organomegaly was found.
There was no hemodynamic failure.
Laboratory examinations revealed mild aminotransferases increase,

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Saavedra for this first hand report of
a possible case of DHF in Bolivia.
Reviewing the dengue reports to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)
during the period 1995 through 2003
<http://www.paho.org/english/hcp/hct/vbd/dengue.htm>, there have not been
prior official reports of DHF from Bolivia. As of 8 Jan 2003 there have
not been any reports of dengue posted on the PAHO website for 2003. (Of
note, only laboratory confirmed cases from Bolivia are being reported to
PAHO.) In the most recent ProMED-mail dengue/DHF update (6 Jan 2003) there
was a newswire report of a death due to DHF in a child living in Santa Cruz
Province along with reports of other cases of classical dengue fever
occurring there. In that report there was a suggestion that serotype 3 was
in circulation. In 2002 there were a total of 671 cases of dengue fever
reported (on the PAHO website) with serotypes 1 and 2 identified as in
circulation in Bolivia.
More information on the laboratory results of this case including the
serotype of dengue virus in circulation would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
