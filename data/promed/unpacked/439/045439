The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (11 Oct [2012]) confirmed an imported case of Japanese encephalitis (JE) and reminded the public to take preventive measures against mosquito-transmitted diseases.

The case involved a 50 year old man who lives and works in Xinhui on the mainland, where he developed fever and vomiting on 22 Sep [2012] and consulted a doctor. He arrived in Hong Kong the following day (23 Sep [2012]) and was admitted to North District Hospital the same day. He was transferred to the intensive care unit on 24 Sep [2012] due to fever, confusion, and deteriorating general condition.

Results of laboratory analysis on his serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples tested positive for JE [virus? antibody?], a viral disease transmitted by the bite of infective mosquitoes. He is currently in a serious condition.

This is the 3rd JE case reported to the CHP this year. In Hong Kong, one case was reported in 2011 while none were reported from 2008 to 2010. A CHP spokesman explained that JE is transmitted by _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ (Culicine mosquitoes), which breed mainly in waterlogged fields, marshes, ditches and small, stable collections of water around cultivated fields. The mosquitoes become infected after biting pigs or wild birds infected with the virus.

Mild JE infections may occur without apparent symptoms other than fever with headache. Severe infections are marked by quick onset of headache, high fever, neck stiffness, impaired mental state, coma, tremors, occasional convulsions (especially in infants) and paralysis.

To prevent contracting JE, members of the public, particularly those living in rural areas, are reminded to take the following preventive measures, especially after dark:
* Wear long-sleeved clothing and trousers;
* Use insect repellents over exposed parts of the body when outdoors; and
* Use mosquito screens or nets when a room is not air-conditioned.
Travellers to areas where JE is endemic should take the following measures:
* Avoid outdoor exposure to mosquito bites at dusk and dawn, especially in rural areas;
* Apply effective insect repellents with DEET to exposed parts of the body; and
* Consider vaccination that should be completed at least 10 days before departure to endemic areas in Asia or the Western Pacific, or staying over one month in areas, particularly rural, that bear higher risks.

[Eastern China is endemic for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), so having a 3rd case this year (2012) is not surprising. Japanese encephalitis is transmitted by several species of _Culex_ mosquitoes. Wild birds (especially ardeids) are the vertebrate hosts of JEV. Although Hong Kong is well within the geographic distribution of JE virus, this is clearly an imported case from Chongqing, some 1115 km (693 mi) distant from Hong Kong. ProMED-mail archive no. 20040623.1672 indicated that from 1992 to 2003, there have been 7 sporadic cases of JE reported in Hong Kong, including one local case in 1996, one imported case in 1997, one imported case in 2001, 2 imported cases in 2002, and one local case in 2003, 2004 and 2011.
