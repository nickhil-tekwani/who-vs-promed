Tusker dies of suspected anthrax at Anaikatti
----------------------------------------------
A tusker and a female guar [gaur] were found dead at Anaikatti and Naickenpalayam, respectively, in Coimbatore forest division in a gap of a couple of hours. The frontline forest staff spotted the carcass of the tusker near the Salim Ali Centre of Ornithology and Natural History at 11.30am on Thursday [17 Mar 2022], when they were on rounds in the Thadagam reserve forest area.

A forest officer said the elephant might have died of anthrax. "The forest veterinary officer has collected samples from the elephant that is aged around 30 years and sent the same to the forensic science laboratory to confirm whether it's a case of anthrax. If the results are positive, the carcass will be burned inside the reserve forest." The officer said they had deployed 8 frontline staff in the reserve forest to prevent other animals from going near the elephant carcass.

The female guar [gaur] was, meanwhile, found dead at Naickenpalayam north beat of Periyanaickenpalayam forest range on Wednesday evening [16 Mar 2022].

"The frontline staff and anti-poaching watchers with Periyanaickenpalayam forest range were on rounds when they came across the carcass of the guar [gaur] with injuries to its foot and hind legs. The animal was not able to walk and couldn't eat," the officer said.

On Thursday morning [17 Mar 2022], forest veterinary officer Dr Rajeshkumar conducted a postmortem in the presence of environmental activists and forest department officials. "Samples of vital parts of the animal were collected to be sent for testing. Later, the carcass was buried inside the reserve forest," the officer said.

[Anthrax is a persistent problem among the elephants of Tamil Nadu. See list of prior posts below. My colleague Joe Dudley (<joseph.p.dudley@leidos.com>), very experienced in anthrax in wildlife in Africa, has kindly informed me that Asian elephants and African Savanna/Bush elephants are preferential grazers and facultative browsers. When grasses are readily available in their most palatable growth phases, both species will eat grasses to the exclusion of anything else except ripe fruits. African forest elephants are unique among living elephants in that grasses -- even when available -- do not constitute a significant component of the diet. Both species consume soil directly from mineral licks and incidentally when feeding on roots of grasses and woody plants. Forest elephants will have ample opportunity to browse, which puts them at risk of leaves contaminated by vomiting blow flies having fed off the carcass of a dead animal. If this applies we can expect other reports from the Thadagam reserve forest area.

The gaur, "also known as the Indian bison, is a bovine native to South and Southeast Asia, and has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1986. The global population was estimated at a maximum of 21 000 mature individuals in 2016. It has declined by more than 70% during the last 3 generations, and is extirpated from Sri Lanka and most likely Bangladesh. Populations in well-protected areas are stable and increasing." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaur)

We have yet to hear whether this gaur died of its wounds or of a concurrent anthrax infection.
