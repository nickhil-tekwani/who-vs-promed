In the south of Kyrgyzstan, 3 people were hospitalized with suspected
anthrax, reports Kazakhstan Today. According to the press service of
the Ministry of Emergencies, "[from] 18 Aug 2011 in the Orozbekova
Kadamjay rural district of Batken province, [people have been]
diagnosed with anthrax and hospitalized; 2 localities are involved:
The village of Pulgon Batken (a woman born in 1947) and the village of
Toloykon Osh (a 47-year-old man and a 9-year-old boy). In the latter
cases, both were involved in meat cutting, and the meat was then
distributed to 14 families." Samples were sent to the laboratory in
the city of Osh, and in both cases, the preliminary diagnosis was
confirmed. The older woman was also exposed to contaminated beef.
Treatment has been initiated.

Sanvrachi [the Livestock Service] is conducting on-site prevention
activities.

Earlier, in June 2011, a diagnosis of anthrax was made in 2
inhabitants of the Jalal-Abad region, reports the Center for
Quarantine and Especially Dangerous Infections of the Ministry of
Health of the CD. In general, according to the data center, the
situation with anthrax is difficult for the Republic. There are more
than 1200 soil pockets of anthrax [cattle graves], and, as over half
have viable spores, they are dangerous and are a source of infection
[to livestock]. Anthrax spores can persist in soil for many years and,
once in a supportive environment (an animal), can cause disease so
that the animal dies. Humans can be infected from handling and
butchering the infected carcass.

[Plainly, the previous 2 "suspect" June 2011 cases have now been
confirmed.

Batken forms the southern boundary of the Fergana valley of
Uzbekistan, which is an area of chronic livestock outbreaks of
anthrax. While Uzbekistan fails to report either human or livestock
cases, they are routinely diagnosed in the surrounding Kyrgyz
provinces. Unfortunately, these provinces are a long way from Bishkek
and, therefore, do not get the oversight they need to have annual
vaccination of their livestock. This would cost-effectively and
cheaply prevent both livestock outbreaks and human cases.
