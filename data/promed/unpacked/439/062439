Due to the significant risk of transmission of the virus from mother to child during childbirth, women in late pregnancy who are suffering from chikungunya virus are closely monitored at the hospital, as well as infected newborns.

Of the 170 pregnant women currently followed by the obstetrics service of the CHPF (Hospital of French Polynesia), one in 2 is affected by chikungunya [virus infections]. So much so that the facilities became too small in the obstetrics service: 25 beds have been installed instead of the usual 20. "When there is a chikungunya outbreak, pregnant women are under supervision during the duration of the fever either in the hospital or at home with a follow-up by private midwives," said Pascale Langy, the head of the obstetrics hospitalization service. "A pregnant woman with a fever must come and see the doctor," added Dr. Micheline Papouin of the neonatology service because it means there is an infection. However, if the disease is moderate and if the chikungunya virus does not develop late in the pregnancy, it causes no danger to her or the unborn child."

Situations most at risk are in fact the term pregnancies. When a pregnant woman develops the disease 6 days before childbirth and up to 2 days after, it can be very serious. Because in this short period of one week at the time of delivery, the risk of transmission through the placenta is increased by 50 per cent, which is huge. "We are very vigilant when a woman shows signs of the disease within days of birth, or just after, because in one out of 2 cases, the newborn will also be infected," continued Micheline Papouin.

But the risk of developing a severe form of the disease is greatly increased in an infant with no immune defense. The effects of a high fever, as in other infections including dengue fever, can lead to neurological disorders. "At this age complications cause severe problems," explained the leader of the neonatal service. Digestive complications with rapid dehydration were the cause of the 1st death of an 8-day-old-infant as a result of the chikungunya virus [infection].

For all medical teams in contact with these women in late pregnancy or newborns, the ongoing chikungunya outbreak leads to increased vigilance. "What worries us is that the number of patients to be monitored increases with the progression of the outbreak, yet we must stay on our A-game, and must continue to be attentive to any unusual neonatal pathology to react swiftly," concluded Dr. Micheline Papouin.

[The expanding chikungunya virus outbreak in French Polynesia, now with over 18 000 cases, brings additional concerns for pregnant women and neonatal infants. It seems curious that this is the 1st discussion of risks of infection of newborns to mothers with acute chikungunya virus infections that has come to ProMED this year (2014). It would be of interest to learn if similar concerns emerge from the thousands of cases that are occurring in the current chikungunya virus outbreak in the Americas.
