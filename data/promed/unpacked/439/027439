In 2009, a mango disease was detected for the 1st time in Senegal.
This disease, reportedly called Mango Malformation Disease (MMD), was
discovered in southern Senegal, specifically in the Kolda, Sedhiou and
Ziguinchor regions, and represents the 1st time it has been detected
in West Africa.

There are 3 identified fungal species: _F. mangiferae_, _F.
subglutinans_ and _F. sterilihyphosum_. The 4th has never been
reported but is similar to _F. sterilihyphosum_ in outward appearance.
Research is being conducted to identify this new species. Egypt and
South Africa are the only other African countries to have detected the
presence of _Fusarium_ spp. [in mango], with losses of up to 98
percent of the production in Egypt before its control.

MMD [poses] an even greater threat than the already problematic fruit
fly. Immediate action is needed to control and eradicate the disease
by combating widespread contamination in Senegal, not to mention other
West African countries.

[Mango malformation disease (MMD) is a fungal disease caused by
several species of _Fusarium_, some yet to be described. Mango is the
only known host, and it is one of the most important diseases of this
crop. The disease was 1st reported in India but has subsequently been
found in many other regions. However, fungal species contributing to
MMD may possibly vary in different areas.

Infected shoots are misshapen with shortened internodes and small
stubby leaves. Inflorescences are shorter, thicker, have crowded
branches, and do not bear fruit. Shoot malformation is most severe on
seedlings but can also seriously affect mature trees. Symptoms are
thought to be a result of hormonal imbalances induced by the fungi.

The epidemiology of MMD is poorly understood. It spreads very slowly,
but if left unchecked, it can severely reduce yields. The main method
of spread to new areas is through infected vegetative planting
material; there is no evidence of spread with fruits or seeds. MMD is
often associated with the bud mite _Aceria mangiferae_, but the mites
have been shown to spread the disease only within a tree, not between
trees. Disease management relies mainly on phytosanitary measures,
removal/exclusion of inoculum, and the use of clean planting material.

Mango (_Mangifera indica_) is one of the most important fruit crops
worldwide. In Senegal and some of the other West African countries, it
is also a valuable export commodity traded mainly to Europe and the USA.
