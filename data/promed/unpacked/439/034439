Italian and Australian researchers report the results of a survey for a novel hepadnavirus (family Hepadnaviridae, genus _Orthohepadnavirus_), related genetically to hepatitis B virus, in sera collected from domestic cats in Italy. The domestic cat hepadnavirus (DCH) identified in this study was closely related (97.0% nt identity) to the prototype feline virus Sydney 2016, discovered in Australia.

By screening collections of feline serum samples obtained from veterinary diagnostic laboratories, DCH DNA was identified in 10.8% sera with a significantly higher prevalence (17.8%) in the sera of animals with a clinical suspect of infectious disease. The mean and median values of hepadnavirus in the feline sera were 1.3 x 10^6 and 2.1 x 10^4 genome copies per mL (range 3.3 x 100 - 2.5 x 10^7 genome copies per mL). For a subset of hepadnavirus-positive samples, information on the hemato-chemical parameters was available, and in 10/20 animals a profile suggestive of liver damage was present. Also, in 7/10 animals with suspected hepatic disease, virus load was over 104 genome copies per mL, i.e. above the threshold considered at risk of active hepatitis and liver damage for HBV.

Hepadnaviruses have been identified in several animal species including primates, bats, rodents, birds and fish. Recently a novel member of the family Hepadnaviridae, similar to HBV, has been identified through transcriptomics studies in a domestic cat with large cell lymphoma. Preliminary epidemiological data collected by Australian researchers suggest that the hepadnavirus of domestic cat (DCH) is common in cats infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). In order to gather additional information on DCH, a total of 390 sera were collected from 2 different veterinary clinic laboratories located in Italy and tested upon request of the veterinarian practitioners after anamnesis, medical history and clinical examination. 174 sera (collection A) were collected for diagnosis of infectious diseases (FIV, FeLV, feline coronavirus (FCoV), toxoplasmosis, hemoplasmosis, bacterial and fungal infections). 266 sera (collection B) submitted to the laboratory for pre-surgical evaluation (n=85) or for suspected metabolic (n=127) or neoplastic (n=4) disease were used for comparison to generate a baseline/control for the study.

Sample screening was performed by a PCR with consensus pan-hepadnavirus primers and a PCR with primers specific for domestic cat hepdnavirus (DCH). Also, the sera were screened using a quantitative PCR (qPCR) design based on the sequence of the Australian reference strain AUS/2016/Sydney (GenBank accession nr. MH307930). DCH DNA was detected in 10.8% (42/390) sera with a significantly higher prevalence (17.8%, 31/174) in the collection A with respect to collection B (5.1%, 11/216) used as control. When analysing the results by age-based cohorts, an increased DCH prevalence (20.5%, 8/39) was observed in the 4-7 month-old group. The complete genomic sequence of the novel feline hepadnavirus (DCH), strain ITA/2018/165-83, was reconstructed. The genome coding sequence was 3184 nt in length (GenBank accession no. MK117078). Full-genome sequence alignment showed a high degree of nucleotide sequence identity (97.0%) to the Australian reference strain AUS/2016/Sydney across the entire genome. The findings of this study confirm that the novel hepadnavirus is a common component of the feline virome. The pathogenic role of this hepadnavirus, if any, is not yet known, but thus far, all hepadnaviruses have been reported to replicate preferentially in hepatocytes.

Almost half of the sera positive for DCH (14/31, 45.2%) of the collection A were collected from cats with retroviral infection (FIV and/or feline leukemia virus, FeLV). These findings echo what has been documented for HBV [Hepatic B virus], which is more frequently observed in immunocompromised individuals. Reactivation of HBV is common in patients with immunosuppression. Even more interestingly, hepatopathy has been described in FeLV-infected cats, with icterus and various inflammatory and degenerative liver diseases. Feline retroviruses have been demonstrated to impair severely the immune system in infected cats and diseases associated with immune-suppression account for a large portion of the morbidity and mortality observed in FeLV-infected cats.

Transmission of HBV in humans occurs through blood and other body fluids and contagion can also occur during sexual contact and by maternal/fetal route. Transmission of FIV/FeLV in cats occurs with similar modalities, as the virus is present in blood and body fluids. Similar modalities of transmission might also be hypothesized for DCH, since we found viremia in 10.8% of the cats. Importantly, the presence of DCH in the sera may pose unexpected risks in transfusion medicine. DCH, along with feline retroviruses, Bartonella spp. and feline hemoplasma, should be considered in the screening of donor subjects.

Out of 42 DCH-infected cats, we could retrieve information on hematologic and serum biochemical parameters for 20 animals. In 10 of these, increased levels of markers indicative of structural or functional liver damage (i.e. AST, ALT, ALP, GGT and total bilirubin) were present. HBV load is considered relevant in infected human patients and varies markedly across the phases of HBV infection. The lower threshold for risk of active hepatitis and liver damage is 10^4 viral genome equivalents of HBV per mL, equivalent to about 2000 IU (international unit)/mL 1. Usually, high HBV DNA load in blood is found in acute infection, or in active chronic stages of disease, but the virus can reactivate after long periods of apparent remission, chiefly in immunosuppressed patients 1. The mean and median values of DCH viremia in feline sera were 1.3 x 10^6 and 2.1 x 10^4 DNA copies per mL (range 3.3 x 100 - 2.5 x 10^7 DNA copies per mL). In 7 out of 10 animals with suspected hepatic disease, DCH load was over 104 genome copies per mL. Although this parallelism between HBV and DCH is intriguing, whether a correlation also exists between DCH replication and liver damage should be assessed in structured, larger observational studies. For instance, we also found the virus in cats with unaltered hepatic markers. The actual patho-biology of DCH in cats should be determined in order to understand better the patterns of DCH infection.

Several novel viruses have been discovered in cats in recent years. Optimizing the diagnostic algorithms and gathering epidemiological data will help assessing the possible pathogenic role of these viruses in cats and eventually conceive strategies to protect their health.

The described event is another illustration of the hazard for free roaming cats being infected by common or uncommon pathogens, or even commensal microorganisms, since their immune system is affected by exposure to feline retroviruses, in particular feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).

Though preliminary findings may be indicative of some liver damage in the DCH-infected cats, the epidemiological and clinical potential of the identified hapatovirus for cats is yet to be further studied. Zoonotic potential deserves being excluded as well. Comparative epidemiology tools deserve to be applied.

DCH appears to be added to the growing list of One Health issues. - Mod.AS
