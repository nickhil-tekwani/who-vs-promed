Exotic Mosquito Interception at Auckland Port
---------------------------------------------
Exotic mosquitoes have been found in a used imported concrete mixer
at the Port of Auckland, New Zealand, by the Ministry of Agriculture
and Forestry Quarantine staff during a routine inspection.
The species was identified as _Aedes albopictus_, also known as the
Asian Tiger mosquito. This species is of particular concern because
not only might it carry the Ross River Virus, it is an excellent
vector of dengue fever and yellow fever.
The larvae were found on the ship Sochi from Yokohama, Japan, which
was carrying mixed cargo to New Zealand. The larvae were intercepted
on Sat 22 May 2004, after the ship had docked in Auckland. The ship
has been cleared and left port to return to Japan.
Ministry of Health Chief Technical Officer for biosecurity (Health),
Sally Gilbert, said the container where the larvae were found was
immediately treated with _Bti_ (_Bacillus thuringiensis
israelensis_), while the concrete truck and risk goods were fumigated
before release.
"We're confident that these measures would have eradicated any other
mosquitoes, but a programme of enhanced surveillance has also begun,
with checking the surrounding area and placing a number of adult and
larval mosquito traps in the vicinity," said Ms Gilbert. Exotic
mosquitoes of public health significance have been intercepted on 27
occasions since January 1998. [see references below]
Ms Gilbert said it was of particular concern to find yellow fever
mosquito because of the implications it would hold for public health
should it become established in New Zealand.
Background:
Mosquitoes go through 4 separate and distinct stages of its life
cycle: egg, larva, pupa (resting stage), and adult. The larvae found
most recently were 2nd and 3rd instar [indicating a developmental
stage between successive molts] larvae. This means that it is
unlikely that any adults had the chance to develop and fly away.
Exotic mosquitoes of public health significance have been intercepted
on 27 previous occasions since January 1998. [see

Exotic mosquitoes are most likely to enter New Zealand by way of:
Being lodged in deck cargo on international ships, breeding in
water-storage and open containers on fishing boats and yachts, as
eggs in tires, breeding in cavities and containers on used vehicles,
used machinery and other imported goods.
MAF Quarantine Service staff are the first line of defence in the
search for exotic organisms on imported goods. Public health staff
carry out routine surveillance for mosquitoes and respond to
interceptions of exotic mosquitoes.
Biosecurity agencies ask that cargo handlers and members of the
public who note anything unusual on imported goods to "see it,
contain it and report it". This message is actively promoted by the
biosecurity awareness programme "Protect New Zealand."
This could mean closing off the vehicle, container, package or room,
and reporting it to the MAF exotic pest hotline 0800 809 966.

[This is yet another instance of _Aedes albopictus_ "trying" to enter
New Zealand that has apparently been successfully contained. I would
certainly not describe this mosquito as "an excellent vector of ...
and yellow fever." Although it might become a vector where it has
invaded Africa and Latin America, there is little danger that if
established it would vector yellow fever in New Zealand, as the virus
is not known in Australasia or Asia. _Ae. albopictus_ is a dengue
vector, especially in Asia, and theoretically might spread the virus
if dengue entered N. Zealand. As regards Ross River virus disease,
this is the most common arboviral disease in Australia, but as far as
I know has not been recorded from New Zealand. Moreover, vectors are
mainly _Ochlerotatus vigilax_, _Oc. camptorhynchus_ and other
_Ochlerotatus_ species, not _Ae. albopictus_ However, in 1998 and
subsequently, _Oc. camptorhynchus_, a known vector of Ross River
virus disease in Australia, was found in N. Zealand.
