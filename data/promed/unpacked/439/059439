A confirmed case of tularemia was reported in Sweetwater County this
week, according to Chuck Sykes, Sweetwater County Health Department
Environmental Health director. Sykes said the man probably contracted
the disease from a fly bite.
Tularemia, also called "rabbit fever," is a disease carried by
rabbits. It can be spread to humans by biting flies [such as deer
flies - Mod.LL] or through contact with blood from a rabbit [as well
as being tickborne - Mod.LL].
Sykes said the man believes he was bitten by a fly at Stratton-Myers
Park while watching the American Legion District A Tournament.
This is the 3rd confirmed case for Wyoming in 2007, he said. A case
occurred in Uinta County and the other in Campbell County. The man
who was infected in Uinta County, claims he got tularemia while
visiting the Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge.
Sykes said tularemia has many symptoms depending on how it gets into
a person's system. However, since these are bites, the most common
symptoms are: a skin ulcer that forms by the site of infection, the
bacteria will then spread to the lymph glands, which will swell and
become painful. The treatment is simple antibiotics, Sykes said.
Although 3 other Green River residents have similar symptoms, they
were not confirmed tularemia cases. They are being treated by private
physicians. The disease cannot be transmitted from person to person.
Sykes encourages everyone to continue to use bug repellent and
reapply the repellent during their time out of doors. He said
residents can also wear long-sleeve shirts and long pants to avoid
being bitten.

[The organism that causes tularemia, _Francisella tularensis_, was
isolated from humans in 1919 during an investigation of the cause of
deerfly fever in Utah. Laboratory studies conducted at the time
confirmed that deerflies (_Chrysops discalis_) can transmit the
organism among animals. Despite this original association with biting
flies, most cases in the United States are attributed to non-insect
exposures, especially tick bites and contact with infected animal tissues.
Regarding to treatment with antimicrobials, the following comes from
the New York City Health Department
<http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/cd/tulmd.shtml#seven>:
"The treatment of choice for all forms of tularemia except meningitis
is streptomycin; gentamicin is an acceptable alternative. For both
drugs, dosages must be adjusted for renal insufficiency. Gentamicin
is safe during pregnancy; avoid streptomycin due to its association
with irreversible deafness in children exposed in utero.
(1) Streptomycin: Adult dosage is 0.5-1.0 gm (7.5 mg/kg)
intramuscularly every 12 hours for 10-14 days. In very sick patients,
streptomycin may be give at 15 mg/kg intramuscularly every 12 hours
for 10-14 days. Pediatric dose: 15 mg/kg intramuscularly every 12
hours for 10-14 days.
Alternatives:
(2) Gentamicin: 3-5 mg/kg/day intravenously or intramuscularly in 3
divided doses, with a peak serum level of at least 5 ug/ml desirable.
Continue for 10-14 days. Pediatric dose: 2.5 mg/kg intravenously or
intramuscularly every 8 hours for 10-14 days
(3) Tetracycline and chloramphenicol are bacteriostatic and
associated with high relapse rates. These agents must be continued
for a minimum of 14 days. Tetracycline: 2 grams /day IV or orally in
4 divided doses or doxycycline 100 mg IV or orally twice a day for at
least 14 days. Pediatric dose: [Not recommended for children less
than 9 years, pregnant or lactating women] If greater than 45 kg,
give adult dosage of doxycycline; if less than 45 kg, give 2.2 mg/kg
twice a day. Tetracycline at 30 mg/kg/day orally, to a maximum of 2
grams/day, in 4 divided doses for at least 14 days.
Chloramphenicol should generally not be used due to the availability
of effective alternatives with fewer serious side effects.
(4) Additional agents with favorable in vitro susceptibility tests
but limited clinical data on efficacy include: fluroquinolones
(except cinoxacin), erythromycin (resistant strains of _F.
tularensis_ have been identified), and rifampin. Penicillin and
cephalosporins are not effective and should not be used to treat tularemia."
The counties of Wyoming where cases have been documented (Sweetwater,
Uinta and Campbell) can be found at:
<http://www.mapwatch.com/multi-maps/full/wyoming-county-map.gif>.
Sweetwater and Uinta are adjacent to each other in the southwestern
part of the state, and Campbell is the northern part. - Mod.LL]
[From an epidemiologic perspective, according to an MMWR report in
2005 (see Tularemia Transmitted by Insect Bites --- Wyoming,
2001--2003, February 25, 2005 / 54(07);170-173, available at:
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5407a3.htm> ): "During
2001--2003, a total of 11 cases (6 confirmed; 5 probable) of
tularemia were reported in Wyoming, for an average of 3.7 cases
per year. In contrast, 10 cases (7 confirmed; 3 probable) were
reported during 1990--2000, for an average of 0.9 cases per year."
The confirmation of a 3rd case for this year (2007) in August,
suggests that this may be a year with increased transmission of
tularemia in Wyoming. - Mods.LL/MPP]
