Poliomyelitis - Ethiopia: rejoinder
-----------------------------------
My attention has been drawn to your post of the report originating from
Xinhua News Agency (via Comtex), dated Mon 28 Jan 2002 [archived as:
Poliomyelitis - Ethiopia 20020128.3429.
While commending your efforts at making information about polio eradication
efforts in Ethiopia and other countries available, I wish to correct some
vital misinformation about Ethiopia.
In fact, no wild poliovirus has been detected or confirmed in 2002 as your
report suggested. The last wild poliovirus (type 1) was from a
2-year-and-8-months-old female child in the then KAT zone of Southern
Nations Nationalities Peoples Region in January 2001.
The information on National Immunization Days was correct and the campaign
of November/December 2001, which reached over 13 million children, was
adjudged to be of high quality by international and national observers.
