New TB strain in South Africa
--------------------------------
A rare new "super" strain of tuberculosis that is costly and time-consuming
to treat has been identified in South Africa's Western Cape province, a
leading scientist said Mon, 17 Nov 2003.
Tommie Victor, a professor of medical biotechnology at the University of
Stellenbosch near Cape Town, said a team of scientists and health workers
had identified the strain after conducting research in 72 clinics in the
Western Cape over the past 3 years.
"We identified various strains of TB that are new to South Africa; one of
them, the DRF150, has never been identified anywhere in the world before,"
he said.
Victor said the team found that DRF150 was resistant to almost all
antimicrobial agents, used to treat tuberculosis. "Usually 5 drugs are used
to combat TB. The DRF150 strain is resistant to 4 of these," he said.
Victor said the new strain had its epicenter in the town of George, about
400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Cape Town, where about 60 cases had been
identified.
About 20 other cases have been identified in other parts of the Western
Cape, but isolates of the new strain have also been found in the South
Africa's Northern Province, the Mpumalanga province and in Nairobi,
Kenya. Last year 224 420 cases of tuberculosis were reported in South Africa.
"It is difficult to measure how dangerous this new strain is, but it is
certainly treatable, so there is nothing at all to worry about," Victor said.
A spokesman for the Western Cape health department said the new strain was
worrying because of the costs involved. Treatment of patients with a
multidrug-resistant strain of tuberculosis costs up to 30 000 rand (USD
4,598) because it requires long hospital stays. Ordinary TB costs about 200
rand to treat, with patients having to take antibiotics over 6 months.
According to the UN World Health Organization's 2003 report on the global
spread of tuberculosis, South Africa has the 7th-highest number of cases of
the disease, after India, China, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Pakistan.

In a paper that was recently accepted in J Clin Microbiol, we described
transmission and characteristics of drug-resistant isolates from 72 clinics
in rural areas of local communities, and amongst these are the strain which
we now call DRF150.
Although the news reports have primarily focused on DRF150, the Beijing/W
drug-resistant genotype is the most prominent drug-resistant strain type in
the local areas that we have studied. With collaborators in Nairobi, Kenya
we also reported the presence of drug-resistant Beijing/W genotype in
Nairobi.
DRF150 is completely different than Beijing/W. For instance, Beijing/W
belongs to major pathogenic group 1, and DRF150 belongs to group 2, and
other markers are different. We are not sure about the precise prevalence
of DRF150, but thus far we have detected about 60 cases in the 72 clinics
during 14 months and almost all these cases come from one town. We are
currently busy using drug-resistant isolates from a drug surveillance study
that was just completed for the whole of South Africa to get a better
picture of the spread of these "mini-epidemic outbreak strains".
