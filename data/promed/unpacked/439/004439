Development of a risk assessment profile tool to determine appropriate use of SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen detection tests for different activities and events in Ireland, since October 2021. EuroSurveill. 2022;27(3):pii=2101202. https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.3.2101202

Early detection of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in particular of infectious individuals, is key to controlling onward transmission. Timely and accurate testing has been essential to mitigate the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Molecular assays (typically PCR) have been considered the 'gold standard' for detecting cases. However, compared with molecular tests, rapid antigen detection tests (Ag-RDT) offer significantly shorter turnaround time, reduced need for laboratory infrastructure and reduced cost, thus providing an additional mitigation measure in the pandemic response [1].

When to use Ag-RDT to reduce onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 requires careful consideration. Factors to consider include the demographics of the target population, the risk for attendees in a setting being infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the risks and consequences of transmission within a given environment. We present the development of a risk assessment profile tool to guide appropriate use of Ag-RDT for screening asymptomatic individuals engaging in common events and activities, to inform the public health approach to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland. The risk assessment profile tool aims to stratify, in real-time, the overall risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with different settings. The tool is recommended in addition to other public health measures.

The risk assessment profile tool is in an updateable format that can be regularly modified based on changes in the epidemiology of infection and emerging evidence around the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and Ag-RDT use.

Discussion
----------
Testing strategies for SARS-CoV-2 vary widely between countries [12]. One strategy for using Ag-RDT is to have proactive localised screening to detect the highest number of asymptomatic infectious cases at the lowest cost [13]. This risk assessment profile tool facilitates a focused approach based on assessments of risk derived from current national epidemiology and international published research. This tool has been used by the Rapid Testing Expert Advisory Group to advise the Department of Health in Ireland on the best Ag-RDT testing strategy for different events and activities and to identify settings associated with a higher-risk profile. Following this, the Government of Ireland has recommended that people who are asymptomatic and engage in activities with a high-risk profile (as identified by the tool) undertake twice weekly antigen tests [14].

This approach does have limitations. While Ag-RDT have lower sensitivity than molecular tests, their specificity is generally high, and they are sensitive enough to detect individuals who have high viral loads. Given reduced sensitivity, Ag-RDT need to be used in combination with other public health measures as a layered approach to reduce risk of transmission [15]. Furthermore, because of lower positive predictive values in settings of low pre-test probability [4], a confirmatory molecular test or higher specificity Ag-RDT testing is recommended [16]. One systematic review [17] (Test 5, page 318) showed very high sensitivity of Ag-RDT in samples with quantification cycle (Cq) values associated with potentially infectious individuals (≤ 25 overall).

The risk assessment tool presented here aims to prevent onward transmission during an activity or event that is imminent by deploying Ag-RDT to identify and remove infectious individuals from that event, even if asymptomatic. Although data are derived from updated evidence syntheses and epidemiological data, they do not incorporate updated risk assessments that may accompany a new virus variant.

The proposed risk assessment tool also does not incorporate unmeasured behavioural factors that may alter transmission risk or unmeasured prevalence of comorbidities or immunosuppression within specific populations that may impact on the consequences of onward transmission associated with an event or activity. These factors are pertinent given the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant of concern. Some risk categories in the tool may need to be adapted as evidence accumulates. In addition, where community transmission rates are so high that regular antigen testing is recommended for everyone as part of standard public health measures, the tool would not be relevant. However, as waves of infection rise and recede, the tool can serve as an indicator for both escalation and de-escalation of the use of Ag-RDT as community transmission rates change.

This risk assessment profile tool has been developed in one country and should ideally be validated prospectively and in multiple geographical areas. However, the model has been updated on a weekly basis since October 2021 and the testing strategy recommended for settings of interest has changed as the incidence of COVID-19 has increased in Ireland. Hence the model can discern the level of risk based on real-time epidemiology. Although further research is needed to assess the tool's capacity to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the outputs from the tool have fed into recent recommendations in Ireland that individuals who are participating in high-risk activities undertake antigen testing twice weekly to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Conclusion
----------
This risk assessment profile tool helps to target activities and events where Ag-RDT could be used to screen asymptomatic people to reduce onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2. By using real-time data, the tool adapts to the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and provides a focused, scientific approach to using Ag-RDT for people engaging in different activities and events.

[2] Cognitive impairment
Date: Fri 21 Jan 2022

Young adults performed worse on memory and attention tests several months after an acute case of mild COVID-19, according to a small study that may support the "brain fog" reported by many.

Most cognitive abilities tested -- including working memory, executive function, and planning -- were normal, but COVID-19 patients displayed significantly worse episodic memory for up to 6 months after infection and a greater decline in vigilance on a sustained task for up to 9 months than uninfected people, reported Sijia Zhao, PhD, of the University of Oxford, England, and co-authors in Brain Communications. [Sijia Zhao, Kengo Shibata, Peter J. Hellyer, et al., Rapid vigilance and episodic memory decrements in COVID-19 survivors, Brain Communications, Vol 4, Issue 1, 2022, fcab295, https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcab295]

These deficits in memory and concentration were not significantly different from normal after 6 or 9 months, suggesting people recover over time, Zhao and colleagues noted.

"We found that COVID-19 survivors who had no or mild symptoms showed impaired memory and declined ability to sustain attention over minutes," Zhao told MedPage Today.

"Importantly, these participants did not consider themselves as having long COVID," Zhao continued. "These cognitive deficits could not be explained by the participants' age, socioeconomic status, education level, employment status, smoking history, or familiarity with the cognitive tests."

"Our findings highlight that cognitive reductions are not limited to patients who had prolonged neurological manifestations after recovery, but might exist more widely in a subclinical form among COVID-19 survivors who would not consider themselves as requiring any post-COVID treatment," she added.

The study evaluated adults with a mean age of 29, comparing 53 participants with previous self-reported mild COVID-19 (usually confirmed by PCR test) and 83 participants who reported not having COVID-19. People who were hospitalized with COVID-19 or had symptoms that affected their daily life were excluded from the analyses, as were people with severe long COVID symptoms.

All participants were recruited from the Prolific online research platform, where the study was advertised as a brain game to test how well people could perform. COVID patients participated an average of 163 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, and about 43% were women.

Participants completed questionnaires and were tested on sustained attention, memory, motor control, planning, semantic reasoning, mental rotation (spatial thinking), and spatial-visual attention. After each minute during testing, they were asked to report their level of fatigue and motivation on a visual analogue scale.

Questionnaire measures of fatigue, forgetfulness, motivation, sleep abnormality, depression, and anxiety levels were not statistically different between COVID patients and age-matched controls. But people who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 had significantly larger vigilance decrement and faster fatigue during a task that demanded attention for 9 minutes. They also had significantly worse episodic memory decline over time, comparable to that of healthy people in their 60s.

"Notably, both deficits scaled with the time from COVID-19 diagnosis suggesting a strong relation with COVID-19 itself," Zhao and co-authors wrote.

"In the present study, COVID-19 survivors began with an apparently normal behavioral performance followed by a gradual decline away from age-matched controls, suggesting reduced ability to attentively track and maintain information over time," they added.

The analysis had certain limitations, observed Stephen Burgess, PhD, of the University of Cambridge, England, who wasn't involved with the study.

"The exposure was not assigned randomly, it was not blinded from participants, and it may associate with various confounding factors, such as lifestyle and social position," Burgess posted on the Science Media Centre. "At all stages of the pandemic, there are likely to be many systematic differences on average between individuals who had a positive COVID-19 test versus those who did not." https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-looking-at-measures-of-attention-and-memory-in-people-who-have-recovered-from-mild-covid-19/

"However, despite this, differences between the COVID and non-COVID groups in terms of several specific measures of cognitive ability looked at in this study were striking, particularly in terms of delayed memory tasks and ability to perform tasks accurately when fatigued," he continued. "Despite the limitations of non-randomized research, it seems unlikely that these results can be explained by systematic differences between the groups unrelated to COVID infection."

Though more people need to be studied, the analysis "raises the possibility that COVID-19 infection could be a causal factor for these measures of reduced cognitive ability in some people, at least in the short- to medium-term following infection," Burgess noted.

The study also was limited by its reliance on self-reported data, Zhao and co-authors acknowledged. The small sample mostly included young and very few older people, and results may not be generalizable.

Discussion. "In this study, we found a relatively high frequency of cognitive impairment several months after patients contracted COVID-19. Impairments in executive functioning, processing speed, category fluency, memory encoding, and recall were predominant among hospitalized patients. The relative sparing of memory recognition in the context of impaired encoding and recall suggests an executive pattern. This pattern is consistent with early reports describing a dysexecutive syndrome after COVID-194 and has considerable implications for occupational, psychological, and functional outcomes. It is well known that certain populations (eg, older adults) may be particularly susceptible to cognitive impairment after critical illness; however, in the relatively young cohort in the present study, a substantial proportion exhibited cognitive dysfunction several months after recovering from COVID-19. The findings of this study are generally consistent with those of research on other viruses (eg, influenza)."

Conclusions. "The association of COVID-19 with executive functioning raises key questions regarding patients' long-term treatment. Future studies are needed to identify the risk factors and mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction as well as options for rehabilitation." - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 33 countries including India (331 328), France (301 614), the USA (197 374), Italy (142 487), Brazil (84 230), Germany (75 280), the UK (74 800), Argentina (69 884), Turkey (65 503), The Netherlands (65 325), Russia (63 205), Peru (51 936), Japan (48 411), Portugal (45 569), Mexico (20 872), Australia (40 152), Denmark (39 263), Poland (34 123), Philippines (29 692), Colombia (26 087), Kazakhstan (25 352), Austria (22 453), Czech Republic (18 412), Panama (17 793), Canada (15 809), Chile (15 718), Ukraine (15 444), Vietnam (14 978), Romania (14 088), Slovenia (13 883), Norway (12 646), Serbia (12 159), and Greece (12 108), reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 4612 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 21 Jan 2022 to late 22 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 75 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 38 of the 75 countries are from the European region, 13 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 4 from the South East Asia region, and 6 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 11.7%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 9.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 13.9% decrease in daily reported cases and a 10.0% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 2.23 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 352.12 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.61 million reported deaths. Transmission continues at a very high level. - Mod.UBA]
