Biologists have discovered cougars carrying a parasitic worm
(_Cylicospirura felineus_) that experts say could cause feeding and other
behavioral changes, possibly pushing the felines to hunt livestock.

The infection was found in the small intestines of 6 of 7 human-killed
cougars checked in the Rogue Valley since January 2004 by state wildlife
biologists.

The Rogue Valley and Douglas County, which is the 1st place in Oregon where
the parasites were discovered 2 years ago [2002], are the only places in
the state where biologists have looked for them.

The infected local cougars were of various sizes and levels of health, and
all but one had empty stomachs, indicating they had not eaten in some time,
ODFW biologist Mark Vargas said.

The only infected cougar with food in its stomach was a large male killed
Friday [23 Apr 2004] while feeding on 3 miniature horses it recently killed
in the Applegate Valley. The one uninfected cougar had a full stomach,
signaling what appeared to be a normal feeding pattern on wild prey, Vargas
said.

4 of the infected animals were killed after complaints of livestock damage
in the area, while one was hit by an automobile, Vargas said. Only 2 were
killed by sport-hunters, including the lone uninfected cougar, he said.

"It's new and it's interesting, but what does it mean? I don't know,"
Vargas said.

[Although the significance of this discovery is a bit hazy, it may prompt
more researchers to look for the parasite when the behaviour of these
animals seems out of character. If other researchers have identified this
organism we would be interested in knowing. - Mod.TG]
