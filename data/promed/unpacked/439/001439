On [25 May 2022] the Canadian Animal Health Surveillance System reported 1 horse tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA) in Lesser Slave River No. 124, Alberta, as confirmed by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) national reference laboratory. The horse was tested at the owner's request after having potential exposure to EIA and displaying clinical signs of the disease. The horse had recently been involved in pony chuckwagon activities.

An official quarantine has been placed on the infected horse and other equids on the property. The CFIA has recommended follow-up testing and euthanasia of positive cases and will monitor the situation to determine when the quarantine can be lifted. Biosecurity measures are strongly recommended, and the CFIA might take additional action at other properties where horses might have been exposed during pony chuckwagon activities.

The Canadian Animal Health Surveillance System reported 1 horse tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA) on [23 Jun 2022] in Perdue No. 346, Saskatchewan. The mare's owners requested testing before she was set to be bred. The veterinarian did not note any clinical signs of EIA, despite the positive test result.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is investigating, and movement controls have been placed on the mare and any additional animals on the premises. Movement controls will remain in place until the official quarantine is lifted, including follow-up testing and euthanizing the confirmed case. The CFIA will also take action at any additional premises where trace-out activities have occurred.

Equine infectious anemia is a viral disease attacking horses' immune systems. The virus is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids from an infected to an uninfected animal, often by blood-feeding insects such as horseflies. It can also be transmitted through the use of blood-contaminated instruments or needles.

A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies indicative of the presence of the EIA virus. Most U.S. states require horses to have proof of a negative Coggins test to travel across state lines.

Once an animal is infected with EIA, it is infected for life and can be a reservoir for the spread of disease. Not all horses show signs of disease, but doing so can exhibit:
- Progressive body condition loss;
- Muscle weakness;
- Poor stamina;
- Fever;
- Depression; and
- Anemia.

EIA has no vaccine and no cure. A horse diagnosed with the disease dies, is euthanized, or must be placed under extremely strict quarantine conditions (at least 200 yards [183m] away from unaffected equids) for the rest of his life.

A 4-year-old Quarter Horse gelding in Merced County, California, tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA) on [26 May 2022]. The California Department of Food and Agriculture reported the gelding was tested before returning to a racetrack. He originated from the Tulare County property where 24 horses recently tested positive for EIA. The horse remains under official quarantine at his home premises, with no other horses exposed.

On [9 Jun 2022] the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) reported a Thoroughbred in Crane County and a Quarter Horse in Tom Green County, Texas, tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA).

Both horses have been euthanized, and the TAHC is working with veterinarians and horse owners to monitor potentially exposed horses. The facilities are under official quarantine, and biosecurity measures are in place.

["Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a viral disease affecting only members of the Equidae family (horses, ponies, zebras, mules, and donkeys). There is no vaccine or treatment for the disease. Infection is often inapparent and results in a lifelong carrier state if the horse survives the acute phase of the infection. EIA is found widely throughout the world. There is no evidence that EIA is a threat to human health. EIA is a reportable animal disease in all states.

"The clinical signs are often nonspecific and of variable severity. Clinical signs in an acute case can range from fever and decreased appetite to severe anemia and sudden death. It is often difficult to differentiate EIA from other diseases. Incubation period is a week to 60 days or longer.

"Additional clinical signs in an acute case can include
- jaundice (yellow discoloration of mucous membranes);
- rapid breathing, rapid heart rate;
- swelling of limbs;
- bleeding from the nose, or red/purple spots on mucous membranes; and
- blood-stained feces.

"Horses surviving the acute phase of the disease become chronic, in-apparent carriers. Some carriers may develop recurrent flare-ups, often following another stress: illness or strenuous work. While donkeys and mules have the ability to contract this virus, most remain non-clinical."

"Natural transmission of EIA is by blood-feeding flies (horse flies and deer flies) and is limited to relatively short distances. This virus is frequently transmitted via unclean or re-used needles and syringes, blood transfusions, and contaminated instruments (IV sets, dental instruments, tattoo equipment). Mares can transmit the virus to foals in utero, and, less likely, transmission can occur via milk or semen.

"There is no treatment for EIA. Because infected animals become lifelong carriers, they must be permanently isolated and quarantined or euthanized.

"Reducing exposure to biting flies through management practices may reduce the spread of infection. To prevent iatrogenic spread, never reuse needles, syringes, or IV sets; use only new, clean needles with injectable medicines and use only licensed and approved blood products. Blood transfusions should be performed only by licensed veterinarians using donor horses tested negative for EIA and other blood-borne infections like equine piroplasmosis.

"Surveillance and testing are the best methods of prevention. Since EIA control efforts began over 40 years ago, the reactor rate has fallen from 4% to 0.004% in 2017 among tested animals. USDA recommends testing every equid annually.

"There is no vaccine approved for use in the US." (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/equine/eia)

It is unfortunate that there is no vaccine in the US. Equine owners have pleaded for a vaccine for decades now and wonder why their cries are ignored. Equine groups have often lamented the lack of technology or funding, but there seem to be no answers from those who research, fund, or develop vaccines.

However, there may now be a form of treatment, or certainly some hope on the horizon. Readers are requested to see the following ProMED post: Equine infectious anemia: potential treatment 20211209.8700153. - Mod.TG
