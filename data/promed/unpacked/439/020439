TULAREMIA, RODENTS, HUMANS - USA (TEXAS) (02): BACKGROUND

Several years ago, there was a case of human tularemia in Wisconsin
in the summer. The state epidemiologist's office determined that a
cat had brought a tularemia-infected cottontail rabbit (_Sylvilagus
floridanus_) into the patient's home. With the widespread tularemia
epizootic going on in Texas, it would seem that the risk of a similar
situation, with pets bringing in dead or moribund rodents, is real,
giving new meaning to the phrase "look what the cat dragged in!"

[Surely the Texas epidemiologist is aware of such risk and is looking
into all aspects of the case. However, this clearly illustrates the
need to be cautious around our pets that hunt. - Mod.TG]
