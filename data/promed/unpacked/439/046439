I would like to make a comment about what happened in Cuba some years ago,
because probably the same would be happening in Lake Springfield.
In a Cuban province some people became ill almost at the same time with
leptospirosis-like symptoms that were then confirmed at leptospirosis, as
the agent was isolated from some patients. All of them used to swim in a
small pond. The pond was located in a land that was deeper than the rest. A
"cattle-house" (large roofed area where cattle was kept for sleeping) was
located on the highest part of the land. When it rained, the water ran down
carrying the contaminated cattle urine to the pond.
It was demonstrated that the same serovar isolated from cattle was that
infecting people.

[For the older epidemiologist, this account will remind us of that
classical epidemiological class exercise involving pigs, a swimming 'hole',
and the dam that broke. However, we still need harder data than such
individual events. - Mod.MHJ
