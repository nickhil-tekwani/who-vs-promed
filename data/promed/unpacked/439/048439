[In contrast to this report, the most recent USDA-APHIS Report covering the
period 1 Jan to 31 Oct 2001, see: West Nile virus surveillance (30)
20011105.2745, lists 344 confirmed and 3 probable cases of clinical West
Nile virus (WNV) infection in horses from 18 States.
Also, this current Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report still omits the
first human case of WNV infection in Louisiana, see: West Nile virus, human
- USA (Louisiana) 20011023.2617, which was reported on Tue 23 Oct 2001. If
this case has been confirmed, the total of human cases in 2001 becomes 43.
