An alarm about yellow fever [YF] was issued today [26 Feb 2008] in
the northeast of Argentina where a suspected case was announced but
later minimized [see below].

The 1st suspected case of locally acquired YF in Argentina was
announced today [26 Feb 2008] in Misiones, the province that borders
on Paraguay and Brazil. It is a 17-year-old who works in a small
textile mill ('obraje'), close to where monkeys that died from the
jungle/wild [sylvan] type of this disease (YF) had been found.

Julio Estevez, director of Epidemiology for Misiones, said that
laboratory tests [on the 17-year old] were "positive for flavivirus
-- either dengue or yellow fever" and therefore this was still "a
suspected case."

When hours later Estevez denied that this was a case of YF, the
confusion further alarmed the public already sensitized by the
[reports] of cases in neighboring countries [Brazil & Paraguay -- see
below].

[The date of onset of this case is not given, nor the date that the
lab received his specimens -- Argentina has an excellent lab in
Pergamino. Isolation of virus from YF cases takes several days, so it
is not clear how this case can be dismissed yet. - Mod.JW.
