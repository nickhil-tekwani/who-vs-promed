Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is an acute viral rodentborne zoonosis
characterized by severe cardiopulmonary illness with a 40%--60%
case-fatality rate. Since its identification in the United States in 1993,
the recognized clinical spectrum of illnesses associated with human
hantavirus infection has expanded to include mild illness, and
case-patients have been identified in Canada and South America (1,2). This
report describes the first confirmed HPS cases from Central America and
summarizes preliminary results of clinical, epidemiologic, and ecologic
investigations. Investigators identified 12 suspected cases with typical
disease and captured four common species of rodents near case households.
In mid-January 1999, reports of a cluster of acute febrile respiratory
illnesses associated with three deaths in Las Tablas and Guarare districts,
Los Santos province, Panama (population: 55 000), led to an investigation
by the Gorgas Memorial Institute for Health Studies (GMIHS) and the
Panamanian Ministry of Health (MOH). Human illness was characterized by
fever, myalgia, headache, and cough with rapid progression to respiratory
failure and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, hypotension, and
thrombocytopenia consistent with HPS. Initial laboratory testing of
specimens at CDC from three case-patients confirmed the presence of IgM and
IgG antibodies using antigens of Sin Nombre virus and the presence of
detectable hantavirus RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR).
As of 6 Mar 2000, 12 patients with suspected HPS have been identified;
three died. The mean age of patients was 42 years (range: 26--58 years);
58% were women. Serum specimens taken from eight case-patients who met the
CDC epidemiologic case definition (1) had hantavirus antibodies, including
two specimens that also were positive by RT-PCR. Serologic testing is
pending for another suspected case-patient. Although the three patients who
died had signs and symptoms compatible with HPS, epidemiologic data are
limited and no specimens from these patients are available for diagnostic
testing. The first case-patient was identified retrospectively as having
onset of illness in August 1999; the latest case-patient had onset of
illness on February 28. All 12 case-patients had clinical disease typical
of HPS; however, seven case-patients had atypical extrapulmonary symptoms
of hepatic, renal, and cerebral dysfunction. No cases have been reported
among health-care workers or from person-to-person transmission. Studies to
define the prevalence of hantavirus infection among community members and
health-care workers, the extent of mild or asymptomatic infection, and the
risk factors for developing HPS are in progress.
Rodent trapping at 10 homes, six occupied by confirmed case-patients,
yielded 54 rodents; four common species accounted for 98% of captured
rodents and were identified tentatively as _Zygodontomys brevicauda_ (25
[46%), _Sigmodon hispidus_ (14 [26%), _Mus musculus_ (eight [15%), and
_Oligoryzomys_ sp. (six [11%). Although only 5% of traps captured rodents,
reports from GMIHS indicated a recent increase in peridomestic rodents
associated with increased rainfall and flooding in surrounding areas.
To prevent additional hantavirus transmission to humans, MOH disseminated
information to the Los Santos community about risk-reduction measures and
to physicians about how to recognize patients and manage HPS. A public
awareness and risk-reduction campaign was implemented nationwide and
included televised public service announcements and distribution of
educational posters and pamphlets. In addition, an outbreak communication
center was established and staffed 24 hours a day by specially trained
physicians, public health officials, and health educators to collect
reports of suspected HPS cases and to answer questions from the public and
health-care providers about hantaviruses. MOH physicians are contacting
hospitals nationwide to promote HPS awareness, to evaluate suspected cases,
and to provide treatment guidance on the basis of standard HPS criteria and
guidelines (3).
[MMWR Editorial Note:
HPS is a pan-American zoonosis identified in 1993 with confirmed cases
ranging from Canada and the United States to southern South America (2,4).
HPS is attributed to infection with New World hantaviruses maintained by
natural hosts in the rodent family Muridae, subfamily Sigmodontinae.
Infection in humans occurs after inhalation of aerosolized virus or direct
contact with infected rodents or their excreta. Person-to-person and
nosocomial transmission have been documented only in Argentina with Andes
virus (5). An increasing number of hantaviruses is being identified by
genetic sequencing, including from the two RT-PCR--positive cases described
in this report (6). On the basis of antigenic similarities, CDC has
identified all cases using Sin Nombre antigens. The predominant viruses in
the United States have been Sin Nombre and the closely related New York
viruses, the reservoirs of which are _Peromyscus_ spp. (deer mice and
white-footed mice); _Peromyscus_ spp. have caused 234 cases reported in the
United States as of March 2000 (CDC, unpublished data, 2000).
The epidemiology of HPS is closely related to the ecology of the rodent
reservoir populations. Increased U.S. incidence of HPS has been linked to
periods of above average rainfall in normally dry areas of the southwestern
United States resulting in improved habitat quality and increased numbers
of infected reservoir rodents (7). Blood and tissue samples from the
captured species of sigmodontine rodents in Panama will be tested for
hantavirus antibody and RNA to identify the specific reservoir. Preliminary
data indicate that rainfall in parts of Los Santos was unusually high
during the fall and winter of 1999. A possible association between
increased precipitation and increased numbers of reservoir rodents in the
affected and surrounding areas is being explored.
Sigmodontine rodents occur throughout the Americas, but HPS never has been
found between Texas and Brazil. However, the discovery of HPS in Panama was
expected and should lead to increased vigilance for the syndrome in Mexico,
Central America, and northern South America.
Because no specific therapy exists for HPS, prevention measures should be
taken to avoid contact with wild rodents, including preventing entry of
wild rodents into human dwellings; eliminating food and shelter for rodents
in the peridomestic environment; safe trapping (using kill-traps) and
disposal of wild rodents that enter homes; and careful cleaning and
disinfecting of areas in and around homes that have been contaminated by
rodents (8). Reports of HPS and requests for diagnostic testing and
epidemic assistance can be directed to CDC's National Center for Infectious
Diseases, Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases, Special Pathogens
Branch, telephone (404) 639-1511. Information about HPS can be found on the
