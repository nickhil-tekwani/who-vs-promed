Foot and-mouth outbreak fades in Viet Nam
-----------------------------------------------
The number of Vietnamese provinces hit by FMD has declined to 7 now
from 25 in July 2006, the local animal health agency said Wednesday
[13 Dec 2006].
Some 260 bulls and buffaloes and over 280 pigs reportedly contracted
the disease in the 7 provinces, namely Cao Bang, Tuyen Quang and Lang
Son in the north, Lam Dong in the Central Highlands, and Hau Giang,
Soc Trang and Tien Giang in the south, reported the Department of
Animal Health under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
However, some of the provinces had detected no new outbreaks for
almost 3 weeks, the department said.
Last week, over 60 bulls and buffaloes in Tuyen Quang infected with
the disease were culled and the affected areas disinfected, the
department said.
Under a national agriculture development plan, Viet Nam will, by
2010, have 35-40 million pigs, 6.5-6.7 million bulls and cows, 2.8-3
million buffalos, and 380-390 million poultry.

[Viet Nam's last FMD update to the OIE was sent on 24 May 2006 (see
ProMED archive (08) below - Mod.JW); it included information on the
evolution of a massive FMD epizootic: FMDV serotype O was reported to
affect cattle, buffaloes and swine in 330 communes, situated in 114
districts within 32 provinces; see at
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_17.HTM#Sec7>.
In addition, FMDV of serotype Asia 1 reportedly infected the same
animal species in 19 communes situated in 6 districts within the
province of Ha Giang; see
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_17.HTM#Sec6>.
An administrative map of Viet Nam, presenting its 61 provinces, is available at
<http://www.angelfire.com/co/hongnam/vnmap.html>.
Ha Giang (Hau Giang) borders China; notably, this is the province
reported yesterday (30 Dec 2006) to be affected by HPAI H5. In case
this province is one of the 5 reported to be currently affected (see
item 1), the veterinary authorities have to tackle there, at present,
2 major epizootic diseases. - Mod.AS]
