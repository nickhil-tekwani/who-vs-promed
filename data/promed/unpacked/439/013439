Two weeks after Afghanistan announced its 1st death from the A/H1N1
flu [pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza], the country has seen the
epidemic's death toll rising sharply, with a shadow cast on the
already difficult anti-terror war. On Monday [9 Nov 2009], Afghan
Ministry for Public Health said 11 Afghans, including one soldier,
have died from the virus. According to the Ministry, 779 cases of A/
H1N1 2009 virus infection have been confirmed so far, with 456 of
them being Afghans and the rest foreigners. Among these cases, 453
have been reported in Kabul, 272 in Parwan province and the rest in
Kandahar, Herat, Balkh, Bamiyan and Nangarhar provinces.

On 1 Nov 2009, the Ministry declared a health emergency, shutting
down schools, universities and public restrooms for 3 weeks, and
advising the public to avoid large public gatherings. Health
officials also advised anyone with a fever to stay home from work and
those with mild symptoms to wear a mask in public places. Worried
about the quickly spreading virus, people wearing blue surgical masks
can now be seen on the streets of Kabul. Sports clubs and wedding
halls also have closed their doors.

The disease also comes as a threat to troops in Afghanistan, as they
now have to fight the A/H1N1 flu amid the war against Taliban
insurgency. Public Health Minister Dr. Mohammad Amin Fatemi said 710
of the 779 H1N1 cases have been reported among military personnel,
with 320 being U.S. and Italian troops deployed in Afghanistan and
390 Afghan National Army (ANA) soldiers.

More than 100 000 U.S. and NATO-led International Security Assistance
Force (ISAF) personnel have been stationed in Afghanistan to fight
Taliban-linked insurgents and al-Qaida operatives to stabilize
security in the war-torn country. The 1st case reported in July 2009
was among U.S. military personnel stationed at Bagram air base, the
headquarters of the U.S.-led Coalition forces in post-Taliban Afghanistan.

To contain the pandemic influenza, Afghan Health Ministry has
distributed antiviral medicine to 34 Kabul hospitals and clinics. But
Health Ministry spokesman Ahmad Farid Raaid said there are only about
50 000 doses, whereas up to 300 000 patients could potentially
require treatment. According to statistics compiled by Afghanistan's
Public Health Ministry, up to 22 percent of the population, or as
many as 6.6 million people, could be infected. Raaid said the
Ministry has increased its appeal for funding to combat the disease
to USD 125 million, adding that the World Health Organization (WHO)
had pledged 550 000 doses of H1N1 [pandemic influenza] vaccine. But
WHO' Representative Peter Graaff said because of global production
delay and huge demand, WHO has not received any of the doses yet. He
predicts that the death toll in Afghanistan could increase
significantly in the coming months. "The population is poor. Many
live in poor hygienic circumstances, and there is a large amount!
of malnutrition. The mortality rate in Mexico, where H1N1 affected
poor people, was considerably higher than in the U.S. or Western
Europe," Graaff said.

Facing pressure from top U.S. military commanders to pull themselves
up by their own boot straps and reverse a reputation for being
corrupt, Afghan police are now hamstrung by a swine flu outbreak. The
H1N1 pandemic has shut Afghanistan's national police academy for the
next 3 weeks, a measure also imposed across all schools and
universities throughout country as it tries to contain the deadly
virus while the insurgency is at its worse.

"No one here has (the virus) yet; it's an alert. It's a force
majeure, like when there is a disaster or an earthquake, and we have
to shut down," said General Sayed Mohammad Qudossi.

The closure comes at a critical time when U.S. President Barack Obama
is being briefed on the extent of the police's problems, ahead of a
decision to send tens of thousands more troops to Afghanistan, a
chunk of them to train police.

Qudossi, who is in charge of 569 students at the academy, said the
closure would not affect training or the quality of his next set of graduates.

The NWFP [North West Frontier Province] Health Department on Friday
[13 Nov 2009] decided to establish a screening point on this side of
the Pak-Afghan border to test all the Afghans entering Pakistan, and
anyone detected with even slight symptoms of the deadly swine
[pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza] virus would be admitted to the
Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC).

This was decided in a meeting of the task force of the Health
Department chaired by NWFP Health Services Director-General Dr Fazl
Mahmood. The meeting took strong exception to the recently detected
swine flu (H1N1) cases referred from neighbouring Afghanistan and
discussed the measures to combat any epidemic.

The meeting decided that, as the situation about the pandemic in
Afghanistan was quite serious, a team of health experts would be
deployed at Torkham border [point] to examine all people entering the
country. The team will refer to the HMC all the patients having
slight symptoms of swine flu [pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection],
where they will be kept in isolation and their specimens sent to
National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad, for confirmation, Dr
Fazl Mahmood told The News International.

He said anti-viral medicines as well as Personal Protection Equipment
(PPE) had been sent to all the major health facilities of the
province, adding that if any hospital needs more medicines, they
should contact the department. He said the department would also
establish a screening point at Peshawar International Airport after
Eidul Azha [Eid-ul-Adha (Celebration of Sacrifice), also known as the
Greater Eid, is the 2nd most important festival in the Muslim
calendar. It marks the end of the Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to
Makkah (Mecca). - Mod.CP], where the doctors would check all the
passengers coming from Saudi Arabia. The task force also sought
information on the precautionary measures the management of the
North-West General Hospital and Research Centre, the private facility
-- where 2 swine flu cases were reported -- had taken so far. It was
learnt that the management of the North-West Hospital informed the
meeting it had carried out fumigation at the hospital and also di!
scarded the bedding and other materials used by the infected patients.

The meeting was attended by the Peshawar executive district officer,
health, medical superintendents of 3 tertiary care hospitals of the
city and officials of aviation departments. On 7 Nov 2009, a female
patient died as a consequence of swine flu in a private health
facility in the city. The patient had come from Herat province of
Afghanistan. Three days later, a doctor of the same facility tested
positive for the virus by National Institute of Health, Islamabad.
Similarly, another Afghan patient hailing from Paktia province was
also brought to HMC with the same symptoms. The unfortunate Afghan
also died. In the wake of the swine flu cases, the Health Department
has alerted all the major hospitals and directed the staff to keep a
vigil on patients showing such symptoms.
