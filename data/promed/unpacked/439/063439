Seoul asks World Cup teams not to bring meat products
-----------------------------------------------------
Trying to contain an outbreak of a deadly livestock disease, South Korea is
asking World Cup teams and foreign visitors to refrain from bringing meat
products into the country, the government's quarantine office said
yesterday. "Members of participating soccer teams and visitors should not
bring meat and meat products for swift clearance at the international
arrival point," the National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service
said on its website [<http://www.nvrqs.go.kr> - Mod AS].
On Saturday, the entry of the Turkish team was delayed because its luggage
included 170 kg of cheese, said Choi Il-soo, a quarantine official. The
team was allowed to bring in the cheese only after it submitted a
certificate saying the product was made with pasteurized milk, he said.
South Korea has been struggling to contain an outbreak of foot and mouth
disease ahead of the month-long World Cup football tournament, which opens
on Fri 31 May 2002. Since the first outbreak early this month, authorities
have slaughtered more than 110 000 livestock -- mostly pigs -- at farms in
Ansung, Yongin, and Jinchon in central South Korea. Last week, Agriculture
and Forestry Minister Kim Dong-tae said the epidemic is under control and
will probably be eradicated before the tournament starts. There has been no
report of a new outbreak for a week.
Japan is worried that the disease may be transmitted through food or
carried on shoes when tens of thousands of football fans travel between the
2 countries during the World Cup. South Korea says there is little chance
of visitors being exposed to the virus since the affected areas are away
from tournament venues. The nearest stadium is Suwon, 24 miles (38 km)
north of the affected region.

[Under the title "Meatless Mondial", the Israeli daily Yediot Acharonot of
26 May 2002 (byline: Moshe Gilead) reports that the South Korean Ministry
of Agriculture is ready to destroy 300 000 animals should the disease
spread into new, uninfected areas; and that 77 livestock markets, out of
the 106 in S. Korea, have been closed down.
