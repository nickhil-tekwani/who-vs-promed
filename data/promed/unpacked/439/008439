On [Sat 20 Apr 2019] the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported that another Clark County, Nevada, horse has tested positive for non-neuropathogenic equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1).The affected 10-year-old gelding recently attended a national-level event in Clark County, the EDCC said.

"This is the 2nd Nevada horse to test positive after being at the National Reined Cow Horse Association Stallion Stakes," which took place at the South Point Equestrian Center, in Las Vegas, from [30 Mar to 6 Apr 2019] the EDCC said.

The gelding had been vaccinated against EHV-1, is not showing neurologic signs of disease, and is recovering with veterinary treatment.

The EDCC said the Nevada Department of Agriculture (NDA) has quarantined the entire Clark County facility. The NDA estimates there are currently 80 horses residing at the facility.

EHV 101
-------
Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM, the neurologic form).

In many horses, the first or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices should be in place at all times to help present disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

The Iowa State Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship confirmed an additional case of equine herpesvirus on an affected Polk County premises. That brings the total number of confirmed cases on that property to 3.

The site has been under quarantine since the 1st equine herpesvirus positive was confirmed, and no horses have left or entered the site since then.

Information for this report was provided by the Equine Disease Communication Center.

[While vaccination will not prevent the neurological form, you may give your animal a better chance of surviving. If you have not vaccinated, please do so. At the same time vaccinate for strangles, rabies, eastern and western equine encephalitis and tetanus. - Mod.TG
