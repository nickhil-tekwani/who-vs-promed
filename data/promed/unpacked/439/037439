The number of people hospitalised with dengue fever has increased by
more than 25 percent this year [2011] compared with last year [2010],
and there have been almost 3 times as many deaths, according to
National Dengue Control Program [NDCP] statistics.

Ngan Chantha said, however, the number of patients had been declining
since mid-July [2011] and the disease was "under control."

Outbreaks of dengue fever coincide with the rainy season. It primarily
affects children. Symptoms include a high fever, aching joints, and
pain behind the eyes. Dengue can also cause internal bleeding and
shock. An individual can contract dengue multiple times because the
virus has 4 serotypes -- a group of closely related microorganisms --
and infection by multiple serotypes is linked to more severe illness.

Ngan Chantha said his office was working closely with provincial
health authorities to conduct education campaigns in provinces where
outbreaks of dengue were occurring, particularly in Kampong Thom.

Dengue prevention efforts are hampered by a chronic lack of funding,
health officials say. The NDCP's annual budget is less than USD 500
000.

As many as 100 million people are infected globally each year,
according to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The disease is prevalent in tropical areas, and poor people are more
at risk due to crowded living conditions and lack of access to health
care.

There is no vaccine for dengue, but early detection and treatment
lower the risk of dengue developing into haemorrhagic fever, dengue
experts say.

[Although overall high-level dengue activity is observed in Cambodia,
the authority stated that dengue infection in Cambodia had been on a
decreasing trend since mid July 2011. From January to July 2011, there
were 7867 cases due to dengue infection in Cambodia, whereas there
were 5497 cases during the same period in 2010 (see prior PRO/MBDS
posting Dengue - Cambodia (05) 20110822.2557).

According to the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office's (WPRO) report
on dengue situation dated 1 Sep 2011, a total of 9451 cases and 44
deaths due to dengue infection, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of
0.47 percent were reported up to the end of week 32 in 2011. In 2010,
a total of 7403 cases and 19 deaths, with a CFR of 0.26 percent were
reported for the same period (available at
