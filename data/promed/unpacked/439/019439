[1] US Food & Drug Administration risk assessment

IMPORTANT NOTE re Infant Formula: ***this does not mean that any
exposure to any
detectable level of melamine and melamine-related compounds in
formula will result in harm to infants***. {Emphasis added. - ProMED]


The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today [3 Oct 2008] issued
the results of its interim safety and risk assessment of melamine and
melamine-related compounds in food, including infant formula.

A safety/risk assessment is a scientifically based methodology used
to estimate the risk to human health from exposure to specified
compounds. It is based on available data and certain scientific
assumptions in the absence of data. The purpose of the FDA interim
safety/risk assessment was to identify the level of melamine and
melamine-related compounds in food which would not raise public
health concerns. The interim safety/risk assessment evaluated the
melamine exposure in infant formula and in other foods.

The safety/risk assessment, prompted by reports of melamine
contamination of milk-derived ingredients and finished food products
containing milk manufactured in China, was conducted by scientists
from the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and the
Center for Veterinary Medicine. The FDA reviewed scientific
literature on melamine toxicity.

Infant Formula
--------------
The FDA is currently unable to establish any level of melamine and
melamine-related compounds in infant formula that does not raise
public health concerns. In large part, this is because of gaps in our
scientific knowledge about the toxicity of melamine and its analogues
in infants, including:
- the consequences of the continuous use of infant formulas as the
sole source of nutrition;
- the uncertainties associated with the possible presence and
co-ingestion of more than one melamine analogue; and
- for premature infants with immature kidney function, the
possibility that they may be fed these formulas as the sole source of
nutrition and thus on a body weight basis experience greater levels
of intake for a longer time than is experienced by term infants.

There is too much uncertainty to set a level in infant formula and
rule out any public health concern. However, it is important to
understand that ***this does not mean that any exposure to any
detectable level of melamine and melamine-related compounds in
formula will result in harm to infants***. {Emphasis added. - ProMED]

Other Food Products
-------------------
In food products other than infant formula, the FDA concludes that
levels of melamine and melamine-related compounds below 2.5 parts per
million (ppm) do not raise concerns. This conclusion assumes a worst
case exposure scenario in which 50 percent of the diet is
contaminated at this level, and applies a 10-fold safety factor to
the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) to account for any uncertainties.
The TDI is an estimate of the maximum amount of an agent to which an
individual could be exposed on a daily basis over the course of a
lifetime without an appreciable health risk. [Lifetime being 70-80 years.
- Mod.TG]

The FDA continues to screen products, collaborate with foreign
governments and their regulatory agencies, and monitor reports of
contamination from international sources to help ensure that
potentially contaminated products from foreign sources are examined
if imported into the United States. If products are adulterated
because they contain melamine and/or a melamine-related compound, the
agency will take appropriate actions to prevent the products from
entering commerce.

Made-in-China pretzels recalled in Ontario
------------------------------------------
Two varieties of coated pretzels made in China have been taken off of
Ontario store shelves after testing positive for the harmful chemical
compound melamine. 40-gram packages of OK OK-brand Kaiser Strawberry
Dressing Pretzels and 50-g packs of Kaiser Chocolate Dressing
Pretzels were found to have traces of melamine and were subsequently
recalled, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced Wednesday [1
Oct 2008].

The products, distributed by Dai Jung Distributing of Scarborough,
Ontario, have been distributed throughout Ontario, a CFIA statement
said. No illnesses have been reported from ingesting the pretzels.

The pretzel recallis part of an ongoing CFIA investigation into milk
and milk-derived products originating in China.
