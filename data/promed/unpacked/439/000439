Abundant rains have left the [New Mexico] wild areas teeming with
rodents -- including rats, squirrels, and rabbits -- raising the
threat for a host of rodent-borne diseases, said Mark DiMenna,
environmental health supervisor for the city. [Rabbits are actually
lagomorphs, not rodents. - Mod.JW]
Tularemia is rapidly moving through the growing rabbit population,
killing them in droves -- although it's not making a big dent in
their populations, said DiMenna and Paul Ettestad, the state public
health veterinarian. "There's been a lot of rabbit die-off in our
north central counties here," Ettestad said. "We've had dead rabbits
in several counties, including Santa Fe and Bernalillo, and dogs and
cats have tested positive in 7 counties."
Tularemia, also known as rabbit fever, is a potentially fatal
flu-like disease in humans characterized by sudden fever, chills,
headache, diarrhea, muscle aches, joint pain, dry cough, and
progressive weakness. It can spread by handling an infected carcass;
being bitten by an infected tick or flea; eating or drinking
contaminated food or water; or breathing in the bacteria.
On the plus side, at least, it doesn't spread from person to person.
And so far, there haven't been any human cases this year [2007] in
New Mexico, Ettestad said. "But don't let the lack of cases fool you.
Tularemia and other diseases are out there", Ettestad and DiMenna said.
In the Albuquerque area, tularemia-infected rabbits have been found in
areas east of Tramway Boulevard and northeast of Eubank Boulevard,
DiMenna said. "We have picked up so many rabbits this year [2007],
we've lost count," DiMenna said. But next year [2008], unless
something dramatic happens with the weather, we could see the
situation get much worse. We think it's going to escalate
substantially. It's likely to be a much higher risk next year." Yates
said.
That's true with all the rodent-borne diseases -- as rodents continue
to grow fat on plants brought out by the wet spring, DiMenna said.
"It's almost monsoon season, and we'll probably get even more
rodents," he said. "If we don't have a prolonged drought or a very
cold winter, we could have hordes of rodents out there by next
spring."
But so far, it's not looking good for less moisture -- or for a
particularly cold winter, said Ted Sammis, state climatologist. "The
prediction is we're getting early monsoons, there's more rain than
normal, and it's probably going to stay that way," Sammis said. "And
winter? I can tell you that it's going to be warmer than normal. But
that's nothing new."
