The fungal disease known as banana freckle has been discovered on the Tiwi Islands, north of Darwin. A community garden on Melville Island has been quarantined by the Northern Territory's Department of Primary Industry [DPINT].

Stephen West [DPINT] says an investigation is underway to find out how the disease got to the island. "We know that some plant material went from the mainland across to the island in 2009. However, there's also been movement of banana material onto the island by other parties, so that's why we've got an ongoing investigation. We haven't made any conclusions."

When asked whether the community will lose all of its banana trees, Mr West said a decision was yet to be made. "The Tiwi Land Council have clearly indicated that their intent would be that banana freckle be eradicated from the Tiwi Islands. So it's a strong possibility (that banana trees will be destroyed)," he said.

Since its discovery in July last year [2013; ProMED-mail post 20130829.1910083], banana freckle has been found on 21 properties in the Northern Territory. Thousands of banana trees have been destroyed as part of the AUD 4.4 million [USD 3.96 million] eradication program.

[Banana freckle disease is caused by several fungi of the genus _Phyllosticta_. It affects leaves and fruit of _Musa_ species. Symptoms include dark spots resulting in a rough surface ("sandpaper feel" due to protruding fungal structures), leaf streaking and yellowing, as well as loss of plant vigour. Severe infections may lead to wilting and death of plants. Fruit yield and quality can be reduced significantly.

The fungi are spread on individual plants by spores moving in water on the leaf or fruit surface, or within plantings by windblown water droplets over short distances. Long distance spread occurs mostly with infected plant material. Disease management may include fungicide and cultural techniques (such as bagging of fruit bunches).

Previously, freckle disease on different banana cultivars was considered to be caused by strains of _P. maculata_ with different host specificities. However, these have recently been re-classified as different species (see link below). In Australia, freckle had previously been reported on lady finger and cooking varieties of banana, but the pathogen affecting Cavendish varieties was reported for the 1st time from the NT in 2013 (ProMED-mail post 20130829.1910083). This fungus, now called _P. cavendishii_, was known to occur in several countries in South East Asia, but there were only unconfirmed reports of possible pre-2013 occurrences in Australia. The type of bananas affected on Tiwi Islands is not stated above, but it is likely that this is the fungus referred to.

Cavendish varieties (see link below) include most of the commercial eating bananas. While only a small part of the Australian banana production comes from the NT, main commercial banana growing regions in Queensland are considered at risk from a possible spread of _P. cavendishii_. Furthermore, the origin of the outbreak is as yet unknown, and, therefore, there may be a threat from additional quarantine incursions from the unknown source. It also remains to be shown in the ongoing investigation mentioned above whether the infection spread from the mainland to Tiwi or the other way round.
