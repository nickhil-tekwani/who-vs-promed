The result of tests carried out on an equine animal was positive for West Nile virus [antibodies] in Aroeira do Itaim, a municipality in Piaui [state], where the 1st [human] case in Brazil was diagnosed. A cowboy in that locality showed [neurological] symptoms in the month of June [2014]. In December 2014, it was confirmed that he had been infected by the virus.

The Office of Epidemiology of the state Secretariat of Health now awaits the results of tests done on 41 people who were seen by the regional health services during the period Jun-Nov 2014 who presented with some neurological symptoms.

The process of epidemiological investigation was done with residents of Aroeira do Itaim, Itainopolis, Jaicos, Vera Mendes, Geminiano, Santa Cruz do Piaui, Paqueta, Picos and Santo Inacio. The material [blood samples] collected from these cases was sent to the Instituto Evandro Chagas. Tests now completed for 18 people in Aroeira de Itaim have been negative for [West Nile, WN] virus [antibodies].

Also, blood was collected from chickens, horses, asses and donkeys. Mosquitoes were captured in light traps, aspirators and human bait, for testing in the Instituto Evandro Chagas.

A team from the Ministry of Health specializing in research with wild birds used traps for capture of species that were domestic near the residence of the cowboy who was diagnosed with the virus [infection]. After blood collection, the birds were released back into the environment.

It is believed that the [human] Piaui patient had been infected [with WN virus] by a mosquito that had previously bitten migratory birds coming from North America.

[Interestingly, WN virus antibodies have been shown to be present in horses from 4 ranches of southern Pantanal, Mato Grosso do Sul state (see archives below). In a more extensive follow up study, WNV-seropositive equines were detected in 10 ranches.

The origin of the WN virus in North America in Piaui proposed in the report above is purely speculative. WN virus has been shown to be present in various parts of South America, including Brazil and Argentina and in the Caribbean. A South American origin seems more likely than other geographic areas. However, a comparative analysis of the genome of the WN virus circulating in Piaui state, or other localities in Brazil, to compare with North American or Caribbean isolates would be very interesting and epidemiologically valuable. Health authorities in the region and nationally are to be congratulated for their follow up studies. The results of the serological survey of the remaining human samples and mosquito testing are awaited with interest.
