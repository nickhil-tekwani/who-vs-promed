The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) announced [Thu 29 Jan 2015] this year's 1st rubella (German measles) case in a 41 year old male who resides in northern Taiwan. Since the case had not recently traveled overseas, Taiwan CDC determined the case to be an indigenous case. The possible source of infection is still being investigated.

To prevent further transmission of the disease, the health authorities has implemented a number of prevention measures and identified 121 contacts, including his family members, colleagues, and healthcare personnel and patients that he came in contact with when he sought medical attention, to monitor and follow up until [18 Feb 2015]. Currently, besides the case's wife who developed cough, none of the other contacts has developed any suspected symptoms. In addition, rubella infection has been eliminated from the case's wife.

In 2014, Taiwan reported 7 rubella cases, 6 of which were imported. Rubella infection in people is typically mild. However, in pregnant women, rubella can cause death or birth defects such as cataracts, deafness, glaucoma, and heart, lung and brain abnormalities in an unborn baby (fetus) during the 1st few months of pregnancy. Rubella is a highly contagious disease.

People who are infected with rubella are infectious from 1 week before to at least 4 days after the rash appears. It is transmitted through airborne droplets or close contact with the patient, but it is vaccine-preventable.

["Rubella is an acute, contagious viral infection. While the illness is generally mild in children, it has serious consequences in pregnant women, causing fetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The rubella virus is transmitted by airborne droplets when infected people sneeze or cough. Humans are the only known host. In children, the disease is usually mild, with symptoms including a rash, low fever (under 39 deg C [102.2 deg F]), nausea, and mild conjunctivitis. The rash, which occurs in 50-80 per cent of cases, usually starts on the face and neck before progressing down the body and lasts 1-3 days. Swollen lymph glands behind the ears and in the neck are the most characteristic clinical feature. Infected adults, more commonly women, may develop arthritis and painful joints that usually last from 3-10 days. Once a person is infected, the virus spreads throughout the body in about 5-7 days. Symptoms usually appear 2-3 weeks after exposure. The most infectious period is usually 1-5 days after the appearance of the rash.

"When a woman is infected with the rubella virus early in pregnancy, she has a 90 per cent chance of passing the virus on to her fetus. This can cause miscarriage, stillbirth or severe birth defects known as CRS. Infants with CRS may excrete the virus for a year or more. Children with CRS can suffer hearing impairments, eye, and heart defects and other lifelong disabilities, including autism, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid dysfunction, many of which require costly therapy, surgeries, and other expensive care.

"The rubella vaccine is a live [naturally] attenuated strain that has been in use for more than 40 years. A single dose gives more than 95 per cent long-lasting immunity, which is similar to that induced by natural infection." (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs367/en/).

[The] rubella vaccine is administered as part of the triple MMR [measles, mumps, and rubella] vaccine. The occurrence of rubella disease is an indication of less than adequate uptake of MMR vaccine.

Further information on this case and a statement regarding current vaccination policy in Taiwan would be welcomed. - Mod.CP
