A dangerous disease is currently seen in guava trees, causing financial losses to farmers. Small black spots appear on the fruits and the fruits rot from the inside. Small buds and flowers also dry up and fall prematurely. It is a fungal disease caused by _Colletotrichum_ [species] and is most prevalent during the rainy season. It first attacks leaves and twigs, but if the anthracnose is not treated in time, even thick branches wither.

[Anthracnose of guava (_Psidium guajava_) is caused by the fungi _Colletotrichum psidii_ or/and _C. coccodes_ (various previous names for both). Fungi in this genus have been reported to cause anthracnose-like symptoms on many crops. In woody hosts, symptoms may include flower blight, pre- and post-harvest fruit rot, twig dieback, and leaf spots. Anthracnose can completely destroy the flowers and cause extensive dead areas on leaves, greatly reducing yield. The fungi apparently invade the skin of young fruit and remain in a latent state until fruit ripening begins. Ripe fruit, either before or after picking, can then develop prominent dark brown to black spots. Fruit infection commonly occurs and can result in extensive rotting.

The fungi have a long saprophytic survival ability on dead twigs and fallen leaves. These are the main sources of inoculum and spread may occur with infected plant material, by mechanical means (including insect activities), and water splash. Disease development is favoured by humid conditions during the period from the onset of flowering until fruit are about half size. Control of anthracnose usually centers on a diligent fungicide programme, but may also include phytosanitation to reduce inoculum, as well as cultural measures to reduce environmental moisture.
