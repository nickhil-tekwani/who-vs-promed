The deaths of several dozen crows and 2 barn owls in Hoym
[Saxony-Anhalt] in the past week is a mystery. The 1st 53 dead crows
were found under their roosting trees on an exit road from Hoym.
Shortly after, the 2 dead owls were found in the rectory garden, a
loss that weighs heavily on the community because these birds are on
the list of endangered animal species.

Even after the examination of the dead birds by the State Office for
Consumer Protection, Stendal branch, many questions remain, said
Christian Lutter, veterinary officer of the Salzland district.
However, the experienced veterinarian could at least exclude that the
birds died of a highly contagious poultry disease.

According to Lutter, the animals examined apparently died of acute
cardiovascular failure that could have been triggered by various
factors, including bacterial or parasitic infections that weakened the
animals, possibly acutely. "However, this does not explain the
massive, almost simultaneous deaths of the birds," he said. Maybe the
birds had eaten food that was treated with pesticides; however, there
is no concrete evidence for it.

[Not surprisingly, infectious diseases have been excluded. Among
potential toxic agents, avicides, such as avitrol (4-aminopyridine),
deserve to be taken into consideration. Results of the investigation
will be appreciated. - Mods.TG/AS]
