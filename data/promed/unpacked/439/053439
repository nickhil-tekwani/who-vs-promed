Two horses at Woodbine Race Course have tested positive for equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) and have been transferred to the equine center at nearby University of Guelph.

Canadian Thoroughbred reports the infected horses resided at Barn 12 on the Woodbine backstretch and were sent to Equine Guelph in Ontario on Saturday [16 May 2020]. Three other horses were also removed from Barn 12 and quarantined as a precautionary measure.

Testing on the remaining horses in Barn 12 was to take place Sunday [17 May 2020] with results to be known on Tuesday [19 May 2020]. Horses in Barn 12 will not be permitted to leave the facility until the results are received.

Canadian Thoroughbred reports EHV-1 has an incubation period of approximately 3-8 days. It notes EHV-1 is a common DNA virus that resides in all horses, largely without afflicting symptoms, similar to chickenpox in humans. EHV-1 is spread largely through nasal secretions "that can live on gloves, boots, and equipment."

Woodbine is set to reopen for racing on 6 Jun [2020] without spectators and with strict protocols in place to protect against COVID-19. Track officials acknowledged the EHV-1 outbreak adds yet another layer of issues to contend with.

Officials at the North Dakota Department of Agriculture (NDDA) have confirmed a Ward County horse with the neurologic form of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM). No recent movement of horses to or from the farm of residence occurred, and no other horses are reported as exposed. The affected horse is recovering under the owner's care.

EHV 101
Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and equine herpesvirus myeloencephalitis (EHM, the neurologic form).

In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with EHM usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help prevent disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

[None of the available vaccines has a label claim to prevent the neurologic form of EHV-1 infection. It has been suggested vaccines may assist in limiting the spread of outbreaks of equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM; equine herpes myeloencephalopathy/EHM is an alternative name for a neurologic disease associated with EHV) by limiting nasal shedding of EHV-1 and dissemination of infection. For this reason, some experts hold the opinion there may be an advantage to vaccinating in the face of an outbreak. If this approach is pursued, only afebrile and asymptomatic horses should be vaccinated, and protection against clinical EHM should not be an expectation. The vaccines with the greatest ability to limit nasal shedding and viremia of the neurovirulent strain include the vaccines licensed for control of abortion (Pneumabort-K and Prodigy) and the modified live vaccine (Rhinomune and Calvenza).
