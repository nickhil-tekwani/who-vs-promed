Cow disease hits KZN
--------------------
The Department of Environmental Affairs in KwaZulu-Natal has declared places around Louwsberg, North of the province, a crisis area.

This follows the death of hundreds of cattle after an outbreak of a corridor disease, a tick[-borne] disease that affects cattle. The department says it will approach the treasury for additional funding in a bid to fight the disease.

Cows contract the disease from ticks usually found on buffalos. For residents, the cattle are their livelihood.

A needs report of the area will be presented to the provincial cabinet.

["Corridor disease" (aka Theileriosis, East Coast fever) is a highly pathogenic disease of Cape buffaloes (_Syncerus caffer_) and cattle in eastern and southern Africa caused by the protozoan _Theileria parva lawrencei_ and transmitted primarily by the tick _Rhipicephalus appendiculatus_; lesions and symptoms are similar to those of East Coast fever. It is one of 3 epidemiologically different diseases of which 3 different types of _T. parva_ are the respective causative agents; the other 2 are East Coast fever (ECF), caused by _T. p. parva_, and January disease, caused by _T. p. bovis_.

Theileriosis is an OIE notifiable disease. According to OIE data, the last report on its occurrence in South Africa dates back to September 2006.
