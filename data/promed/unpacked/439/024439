Plague outbreak update: 1947 cases, 143 deaths in Madagascar
------------------------------------------------------------
In an update on the plague outbreak in Madagascar, UN officials now put the ever changing case tally in the epidemic that began on [1 Aug 2017] at 1947 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of plague through [3 Nov 2017]. Of these, 1437 (74 percent) were clinically classified as pulmonary plague, 295 (15 percent) were bubonic plague, one was septicemic, and 211 were not yet classified (further classification of cases is in process). The death count has risen to 143.

Officials have been saying recently that the number of new cases of pulmonary plague is declining across the country. However, while the decline in the incidence is encouraging, more cases of plague are expected to be reported in Madagascar until the typical plague season ends in April 2018.

To that effect, sustaining ongoing operations during the outbreak and through the plague season is crucial to minimize the current human-to-human transmission of pneumonic plague and the bubonic plague infections. The key control measures that need to continue to the end of April 2018 include active case finding and treatment, comprehensive contact identification, follow-up and antibiotic treatment, rodent and flea control, and safe and dignified burials.

[There continues to be substantial variation in the numbers reported in this significant outbreak of plague, making interpretations of control difficult to make. Additionally, it is still difficult to see how the case fatality rate could be as low as it is with over 60 percent of the cases said to be pneumonic plague.

Abstract:
"The Enterobacteriaceae family members, including the infamous _Yersinia pestis_, the causative agent of plague, have a highly conserved interbacterial signaling system that is mediated by the autoinducer-2 (AI-2) quorum-sensing molecule. The AI-2 system is implicated in regulating various bacterial virulence genes in diverse environmental niches. Deletion of the gene encoding the synthetic enzyme for the AI-2 substrate, luxS, leads to either no significant change or, paradoxically, an increase in in-vivo bacterial virulence. We showed that deletion of the rbsA and lsrA genes, components of ABC transport systems that interact with AI-2, synergistically disrupted AI-2 signaling patterns and resulted in a more-than-50-fold decrease in _Y. pestis_ strain CO92 virulence in a stringent pneumonic plague mouse model. Deletion of luxS or lsrK (encoding AI-2 kinase) from the ArbsA AlsrA background strain or complementation of the ArbsA AlsrA mutant with the corresponding gene(s) reverted the virulence phenotype to that of the wild-type _Y. pestis_ CO92. Furthermore, the administration of synthetic AI-2 in mice infected with the ArbsA AlsrA AluxS mutant strain attenuated this triple mutant to a virulence phenotype similar to that of the ArbsA AlsrA strain in a pneumonic plague model. Conversely, the administration of AI-2 to mice infected with the ArbsA AlsrA AluxS AlsrK mutant did not rescue animals from lethality, indicating the importance of the AI-2-LsrK axis in regulating bacterial virulence. By performing high-throughput RNA sequencing, the potential role of some AI-2-signaling-regulated genes that modulated bacterial virulence was determined. We anticipate that the characterization of AI-2 signaling in _Y. pestis_ will lead to reexamination of AI-2 systems in other pathogens and that AI-2 signaling may represent a broad-spectrum therapeutic target to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which represent a global crisis of the 21st century.

"_Yersinia pestis_ is the bacterial agent that causes the highly fatal disease plague. The organism represents a significant concern because of its potential use as a bioterrorism agent, beyond the several thousand naturally occurring human infection cases occurring globally each year. While there has been development of effective antibiotics, the narrow therapeutic window and challenges posed by the existence of antibiotic-resistant strains represent serious concerns. We sought to identify novel virulence factors that could potentially be incorporated into an attenuated vaccine platform or be targeted by novel therapeutics. We show here that a highly conserved quorum-sensing system, autoinducer-2, significantly affected the virulence of _Y. pestis_ in a mouse model of pneumonic plague. We also identified steps in autoinducer-2 signaling which had confounded previous studies and demonstrated the potential for intervention in the virulence mechanism(s) of autoinducer-2. Our findings may have an impact on bacterial pathogenesis research in many other organisms and could result in identifying potential broad-spectrum therapeutic targets to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which represent a global crisis of the 21st century." - Mod.LL
