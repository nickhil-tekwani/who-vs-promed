Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza In China (People's Rep.): Follow-Up

Information received on 19 and 20 Jun 2006 from Mr. Jia Youling,
Director General, Veterinary Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing:
End of this report period: 20 Jun 2006.
Identification of agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)

number of susceptible birds have occurred in Shanxi province in the

but does indicate that over a million birds (1 470 000) were
depopulated. There were 2600 cases and 2400 deaths, again with no
breakdown by location.
* Note by the OIE Animal Health Department: outbreaks occurring in

inhibition test-RT-PCR and virus isolation were all positive on 17 Jun 2006.

[Obviously, these 3 reports indicate that outbreaks are continuing in
poultry over a widespread geographic area, from Asia to Eastern
Europe to Africa. Unfortunately, there are some gaps in reporting
that make it difficult to determine the distribution of events within
countries. For example, in Niger and the Ukraine, it appears that not
all the susceptible birds were depopulated or destroyed. In China, we
don't know how many birds were susceptible. Again, in Niger and
China, several outbreaks in different locations are lumped together
without knowing, geographically, how closely located these different
places are. Transparency requires an open sharing of information but
also sufficient detail to make the information understandable to
those who haven't collected the data. - Mod.PC]
