Salmonella outbreak linked to raw frozen breaded stuffed chicken products
---------------------------------------------------------------

Fast facts
----------
Illnesses: 28 (11 new)
Hospitalizations: 11 (3 new)
Deaths: 0
States: 8 (2 new)
Recall: yes
Investigation status: active

Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback data show that this outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis infections is linked to raw frozen breaded stuffed chicken products. Since the last update on 2 Jun 2021, a total of 11 more illnesses have been reported and a recall was announced.

Epidemiologic data
------------------
As of 10 Aug 2021, a total of 28 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis have been reported from 8 states (see map https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/enteritidis-06-21/map.html). Illnesses started on dates ranging from 21 Feb 2021 to 28 Jun 2021 (see timeline https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/enteritidis-06-21/epi.html).

State of residence / Number of sick people
------------------------------------------
AZ / 1
CT / 1
IL / 9
IN / 4
MI / 1
MN / 4
NV / 1
NY / 7

Sick people range in age from 3 to 83 years, with a median age of 39 years, and 52% are female. Of 24 people with information available, 11 have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for salmonella. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

State and local public health officials interviewed people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick. Of the 21 people interviewed, 13 (62%) reported preparing and eating frozen breaded stuffed chicken products. They bought different brands of raw frozen breaded stuffed chicken products from multiple stores.

Laboratory and traceback data
-----------------------------
USDA-FSIS and Indiana officials collected unopened packages of Kirkwood Chicken, Broccoli and Cheese from a sick person's house for testing and identified the outbreak strain in the product. USDA-FSIS investigated and found that these products were produced at facility P-2375. Whole genome sequencing of bacteria from 25 sick people's samples and 5 food samples did not predict any antimicrobial resistance. Standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently under way.

Public health actions
---------------------
On 9 Aug 2021, Serenade Foods recalled approximately 59 251 pounds of frozen raw breaded stuffed chicken that bear establishment number "P-2375" inside the USDA mark of inspection. Do not eat, sell, or serve recalled products. These products may not account for all of the illnesses in this outbreak. Investigators are working to determine if there are additional products that may be linked to illness.

-------------

[Adequate cooking and good kitchen hygiene are both required to minimize the risk of transmission of salmonellosis in the home. Chicken is a common vehicle for transmission of salmonellosis, but since the chicken was breaded, eggs could also be involved. - Mod.LL
