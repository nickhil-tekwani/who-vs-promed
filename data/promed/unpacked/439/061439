The Bali Husbandry and Animal Health Agency had found 7 rabid dogs in 5 regencies by mid-June [2014]. The 5 regencies are Jembrana, Bangli, Buleleng, Klungkung, and Karangasem.

Head of the agency, I Ketut Gede Nata Kusuma, said in May [2014] that 9 canines had been infected by rabies. During the January-June 2014 period, the office checked 86 samples and found 46 dogs had tested positive, with Buleleng regency topping the list with 12 cases.

Nata Kusuma said Bali would be struggling to end rabies on the island by 2020. Early this year [2014], the provincial administration launched the 5th phase of its mass rabies vaccination program, targeting 350 000 dogs.

Bali is confronting a skyrocketing birth rate among stray dogs, with an increase of 2.5 million per year scattered throughout the island. [This is not correct -- see below. - Mod.JW]

Since a rabies outbreak hit the island in 2008, there has been greater public awareness of how to responsibly care for dogs and how to deal with dog bites. Rabies on the island has so far claimed 146 lives.

Dr Lisa Warden, Director, DOGSTOP, <lisa.warden@gmail.com> questioned: "....the dog population on Bali is growing by "2.5 million dogs per year."

The maximum carrying capacity of Bali for dogs is about 400 000 max. At any given time it is probably about 300 000. However, there is a very high birth rate and high rate of turnover, between culling and road kills.

Back when the rabies outbreak began in 2008, I had just done some dog censusing in Bali and told everyone concerned that the dog population in need of vaccination would be in the 300 000 to 400 000 range. All the officials, though, kept insisting on implausibly high numbers, and insisting that vaccination couldn't be done without killing huge numbers of dogs first. After that got them nowhere for 2 years, Janice Girardi of the Bali Animal Welfare Association [BAWA] vaccinated 275 000 dogs in 2010-2011 and nearly eradicated rabies. This was her report to me on 21 Aug 2011:

"As a very quick update, BAWA finished the vaccination phase one program the end of March [2011] (on budget and on time). We vaccinated 275 000 dogs total under BAWA management. This includes re vaccinating a portion of Gianyar in April and May this year [2011]. We estimate 310 000 dogs in Bali (keep in mind 150 000 were culled before our program started) which is 1 dog to 12.5 or so humans. The Government is continuing the program with some support from the FAO. They are continuing to vaccinate dogs throughout the island. They are also continuing to cull dogs, which is not good news as of course this will immediately lead to a loss of herd immunity."

The government, however, badly botched the program, and rabies reappeared. Now we are seeing the absurdly high numbers again. This might be because using absurdly high numbers provides an excuse for failure. Whatever numbers they fling around, though, the carrying capacity for dogs on Bali is under 400 000. There are not the food resources to sustain more (or even that many -- the 310 000 Janice projected is probably right on the nose.)

[Many thanks to Merritt for this clarification, which makes a great deal of sense and matches the 350 000 target for vaccination by the provincial administration.
