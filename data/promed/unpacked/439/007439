Chile's government confirmed this week that infectious salmon disease
(ISA) virus is present in the Magallanes Region (Region XII) at a
salmon farm from Nova Austral in the Puerto Natales area, north of
Punta Arenas.

According to reports from the company, though no unusual deaths have
been reported at the farm, they agreed to the elimination of 303 000
pre-smolts, to be carried out by staff from Chile's Fisheries Department.

"Currently, we are investigating the virus contagion and whether it
was vertical through the salmon spawns from the Los Lagos Region,
purchased in 2007, or horizontally through contamination from a
nursery in the area, which effectively reported ISA-positive in June
2007 but with no clinical signs," said Nova Austral in an official release.

Cesar Barros from SalmonChile praised the company for its openness
and transparency and said the Chilean government should better
support Sernapesca (Fisheries Sanitary Department) with funds and
staff to improve prevention and monitoring.

SalmonChile has implemented several self-regulatory measures, such as
implementing more resting time for farming areas, bans on fish
movements between farms, and stricter controls in processing plants
to ensure 100 percent elimination of the virus.

ISA is highly contagious and can generate high mortality rates among
salmon but is harmless to humans. However, the outbreaks of ISA have
seriously impaired Chilean salmon industry exports, one of the
country's most dynamic businesses, with an annual turnover of more
than USD 2 billion.

The ISA virus has generated a great controversy in Chile, since farms
want to move from infected areas to supposedly free regions such as
Magallanes, where the local fish industry and environmentalists fear
the spread of the disease.

[This is not the 1st report of ISA in Chile. It seems once this
disease enters the farmed salmon community in an area, it is very
difficult to clear the disease, and antibiotics do not seem to be a
good option.

Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) is an infectious disease of Atlantic
salmon (_Salmosalar_) caused by an orthomyxo-like virus. Initially
reported in Norway in the mid-1980s, ISA has, to date, been reported
in Canada (New Brunswick and Nova Scotia), the United Kingdom
(Scotland and the Shetland Islands), the Faroe Islands, and USA
(Maine), and the causal virus has been isolated from samples from
Coho salmon from Chile and from rainbow trout in Ireland. The disease
has been recorded in Norway earlier in 2004.

ISA is one of the 16 notifiable fish diseases listed by the OIE
(World Organisation for Animal Health); further details may be found
in chapter 2.1.9. of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic
Animals, <http://oie.int/eng/normes/fmanual/A_00026.htm>. - Mod.TG]
