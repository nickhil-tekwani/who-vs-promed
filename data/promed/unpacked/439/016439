[With reference to ProMED-mail post 20040228.0619 reporting the sad
episodes that hurt Sao Paulo zoo in 2004, we have received the following
information from Dr Jaoa Batista da Cruz]:

Thank you for your interest in the case that hurt us so much.

For your information, I would like to let you know that the case is still
under investigation by the Brazilian Federal Police. The diagnosis of
sodium-monofluoracetate toxicosis was confirmed by the laboratory --
(CEATOX - Sao Paulo State University at Botucatu City), which was
designated as "Ad Hoc Technical Assistant" by the Sao Paulo State Justice
-- for 73 animals that died in the episode. Just to clarify, at the very
beginning, the Sao Paulo State Civil Police was in charge until the Justice
decided that the criminal case was Federal (a crime against the
environment), and then the case was passed on to the Federal Police to
conduct further investigation.

Although the Sao Paulo State and Federal Police have no doubt regarding the
cause of these deaths, as far as we know and as per the documents in the
hands of the police, it has been difficult to establish the authorship of
the crime. They were at the point of closing the investigation and sending
a report on the case to the archives, but the Sao Paulo Zoo made a formal
request on 11 Oct 2006 to prevent that action. Our request was accepted,
and the case is still proceeding. Our lawyer is working on the case, and we
expect that new results will come as the investigation advances. Any
information beyond this should not be considered, as the case is still
being conducted under the seal of "Confidential" by the Federal Police. We
at Sao Paulo Zoo sincerely hope that this case will be solved so that we
may have some answers for our zoo and for our society.

[ProMED-mail appreciates this updated information, which resulted from
exchanges between our Brazilian-based associate editor, Jack Woodall, and
participants at a Wildlife Conservation Society-sponsored conference in
Brasilia earlier this month (October 2007).

We are also saddened by the difficulties inherent in resolving a case in
which so many valuable zoo animals were poisoned. - Mod.PC]
