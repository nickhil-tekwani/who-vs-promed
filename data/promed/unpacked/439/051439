Since the beginning of the current Iranian calendar year [21 Mar 2019], 12 people have been diagnosed with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and 2 of them lost their lives, said Mohammad Mahdi Guya, the Director of Communicable Diseases Department at the Ministry of Health, ISNA reported on [Sat 1 Jun 2019].

The prevalence of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in the country has decreased to half in comparison to the same period during the last year, however the disease happens more in hot weather hence more precise statistics will be revealed in late summer, he explained.

The disease was spotted in the cities of Iranshahr, Zabol, Kermanshah, and Bandar Abbas as well as Gilan province, he said.

Those who work in slaughterhouses or keep livestock at their home and those who live in rural places are more endangered, he said.

The virus is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals. Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons.

The contact with meat which is frozen for more than 24 hours does not transmit the virus, he explained.

He also warned about nurses and medical staff who may [care for] a patient with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, he said.

Well-cooked meat does not transmit the virus, however, eating raw meat may transmit the virus, he warned.

According to health ministry, annually, some 100 to 150 cases of Crimean-Congo fever are reported in Iran.

According to World Health Organization, the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. The CCHF is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent.

[The report above mentions Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) case numbers for 2019, beginning 21 Mar 2019 according to the Iranian calendar. Iran is one of the countries where CCHF has been endemic for many years and cases are reported form many provinces on a regular basis.

CCHF is a tick-borne zoonotic disease with high case fatality rates in humans and the potential to cause outbreaks. Of the epidemic-prone diseases prioritised by the WHO Research & Development (R&D) Blueprint; CCHF is the most widespread, found in around 30 countries across Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent and is expected to continue to expand its range (https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever/en/).

Although this roadmap focuses on the development of new or improved products and medical 36 countermeasures, other public health preparedness actions are also critical for successful prevention of CCHF epidemics. Foremost amongst these is the need for regional, national, and international surveillance, reporting not only human CCHF cases but also monitoring tick and animal reservoirs for evidence of CCHFV or seroconversion. This will require agreements and mechanisms 40 for data sharing in real time and cooperation and coordination between the human, animal, and environmental health sectors for the good of public-health disease control. - Mod.UBA
