Large and ongoing outbreak of haemolytic uremic syndrome, Germany,
May 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: C Frank, MS Faber, M Askar, et al, on behalf of the HUS
investigation team]

Since early May 2011, an increased incidence of haemolytic uremic
syndrome (HUS) and bloody diarrhea related to infections with Shiga
toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) has been observed in
Germany, with most cases in the north of the country. Cases reported
from other European countries had traveled to this area. 1st results
of a case/control study conducted in Hamburg suggest an association
between the occurrence of disease and the consumption of raw tomatoes,
cucumber, and leaf salad.

An unusually high number of cases of haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)
has been observed in Germany since early May 2011. This report
presents the preliminary results of the investigation as of 26 May
2011.

Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a serious and sometimes deadly
complication that can occur in bacterial intestinal infections with
Shiga toxin (syn. verotoxin)-producing _E. coli_ (STEC/VTEC). The
complete clinical picture of HUS is characterised by acute renal
failure, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Typically it is
preceded by diarrhea, often bloody. Each year, on average 1000
symptomatic STEC-infections and approximately 60 cases of HUS are
notified in Germany, affecting mostly young children under 5 years of
age (1). In 2010 there were 2 fatal HUS cases (1).

STEC are of zoonotic origin and can be transmitted directly or
indirectly from animals to humans. Ruminants are considered to be the
reservoir, especially cattle, sheep, and goats. Transmission occurs
via the faecal-oral route through contact to animals (or their feces),
by consumption of contaminated food or water, but also by direct
contact from person to person (smear infection). The incubation period
of STEC is between 2 and 10 days, the latency period between the
beginning of gastrointestinal symptoms and enteropathic HUS is
approximately one week.

Outbreak description
--------------------
The table [see source URL above - Mod.LL] lists the number of cases
of HUS or suspected HUS notified to local health departments and
communicated by the federal states to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI).
Suspected HUS are included as the syndrome is a process and suspected
HUS typically develops over the course of a few days into the full
clinical picture.

Disease onset (regarding diarrhea) in the 214 patients detected so
far was between 2 and 24 May 2011. A total of 119 (56 percent) of the
cases were communicated from 4 northern federal states (Hamburg,
Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony and Bremen). The highest cumulative
incidence has been recorded in the 2 northern city states of Hamburg
and Bremen. An additional 31 cases occurred in Hesse. They were
connected to a catering company supplying the cafeterias of a company
and a residential institution. It is likely that these cases
constitute a satellite outbreak.

Besides the geographic clustering, the age and sex distribution of
the cases is conspicuous: of the 214 cases, 186 (87 percent) are 18
years of age or older (mostly young to middle-aged adults) and 146 (68
percent) are female. In the notification data for HUS cases from 2006
to 2010, the proportion of adults lay between 1.5 and 10 percent
annually, and the sexes were affected equally.

Cases linked to this outbreak were also communicated from other
European countries: on 25 May 2011, Sweden reported through the
European Warning and Response System (EWRS) 9 cases of HUS, 4 of whom
had traveled in a party of 30 to northern Germany from 8 to 10 May
2011. Denmark reported 4 cases of STEC infection, 2 of them with HUS.
All cases had a recent travel history to northern Germany. Another 2
HUS cases with travel history to northern Germany in the relevant
period were communicated, one each by the Netherlands and by the
United Kingdom.

So far 2 German HUS cases have died of the disease (both female, one
in her 80s, one in her 20s).

Laboratory investigations
-------------------------
Investigations at the National Reference Centre for Salmonella and
other bacterial enteric pathogens at the RKI (Wernigerode) of isolates
from 2 patients from Hesse and Bremerhaven suggests that the outbreak
strain is an _E. coli_ strain of serotype O104 with the following
characteristics: Shiga toxin 2 (vtx2a, EQA nomenclature 2011, WHO
Centre _E. coli_ SSI Copenhagen)- producing, intimin (eae)-negative,
and enterohaemolysin (hly)-negative. The strain shows a high
resistance to third generation cephalosporins (through extended
spectrum beta-lactamases, ESBL, CTX-M-type), and a broad antimicrobial
resistance to, among others, trimethoprim/sulphonamide and
tetracycline.

A further 13 isolates from Muenster, Paderborn, Hamburg, and
Frankfurt were analyzed in the consulting laboratory for hemolytic
uraemic syndrome in the Institute of Hygiene at the University
hospital in Muenster. All were sequence-typed as ST678 (stx1-, stx2+,
eae-, flagellin-coding gene flicH4), group HUSEC 41, also indicating
serotype O104 (2,3). Whether these results reflect the entire
situation in Germany needs to be confirmed by the analysis of a
greater number of isolates. As in the past most outbreaks of HUS in
Germany and elsewhere were found to be connected with STEC O157
strains, the identification of serotype O104 in this context is highly
unusual, although, _E. coli_ O104 has previously been described as the
cause of an outbreak in the USA in 1994 (4).

Investigation into the source of infection
------------------------------------------
The large number of persons suddenly affected, the geographical and
demographic distribution, as well as 1st interviews of patients
suggested STEC-contaminated food as the vehicle of infection. Foods
like raw milk and raw meat, which were identified as vehicles in
former STEC outbreaks, appear not to be related to the current event.
Preliminary results of a case-control study conducted by the RKI and
the Hamburg health authorities demonstrate a significant association
between disease and the consumption of raw tomatoes, cucumbers, and
leafy salads. This study collected food histories for the week before
symptom onset for 25 patients hospitalized with HUS (n=20) or bloody
diarrhea with laboratory-confirmed STEC infection (n=5), who all had
onset of disease between 9 and 25 May 2011. In addition, 96 controls
matched by age, sex and residence were asked about their food
consumption during the week before the interview. The food items they
were asked about were those frequently mentioned in previous in-depth
interviews of HUS cases. Consumption of each of the named food items
was reported by around 90 percent of the cases in comparison to around
60 percent of the controls, yielding odds ratios between around 4 and
7, all statistically significant. Nevertheless it is possible that
another or an additional food item is the source of infection. The
results cannot necessarily be transferred to the whole of Germany
because the study was limited to Hamburg.

Regarding the source of the suspicious food items the study showed a
heterogeneous picture. It can be excluded that the source is a single
shop or restaurant. Based on these findings, food trace-back
investigations are currently ongoing.

Evaluation of the situation
---------------------------
The current events represent one of the largest described outbreaks
of HUS/STEC worldwide and the largest in Germany, with a very atypical
age and sex distribution of the cases. Incident cases of HUS or
suspected HUS are continuing to be reported at least in Northern
Germany, where the emergency room consultations for bloody diarrhea
remain elevated. Thus it has to be assumed that the source of
infection is still active. Many patients with bloody diarrhea need to
be admitted to hospital, and HUS patients often need intensive care
with dialysis and/or plasmapheresis, which puts a severe strain on
hospital resources in some areas. The epidemiological studies that
were conducted in cooperation with regional and local health
departments rapidly delivered important clues as to certain food items
that could be linked to the outbreak. Further epidemiological studies,
laboratory investigations and trace back of food items is needed to
confirm these results and to narrow down the source of infection.

Recommendations for consumers and patients
------------------------------------------
Considering the ongoing outbreak that included many cases with a
severe course of disease, the RKI and the Federal Institute for Risk
Assessment (BfR) recommend to abstain from consuming raw tomatoes,
cucumbers, and leafy salads, especially in northern Germany, until
further notice. Regular food hygiene rules remain in effect (5).

For persons with diarrhea the importance of strict hand hygiene is
emphasised. Patients with bloody diarrhea should seek medical aid
immediately. Physicians are reminded to initiate STEC stool
diagnostics for these patients and to closely monitor them for the
development of HUS. Patients suspected of developing HUS should be
referred to appropriate stationary care.

Diagnostic laboratories are requested to send STEC isolates to the
National Reference Centre for Salmonella and other bacterial enteric
pathogens. The Protection Against Infection Act of 2001 renders both
the laboratory confirmation of an STEC infection and the clinical
diagnosis of HUS or suspected HUS notifiable to the local health
department.

[This is the most detailed report to data regarding this large
outbreak and was likely prepared prior to the report of several more
deaths in Germany and a link to Spanish cucumbers. Additionally, it
appears that all the EU cases outside of the German borders, to this
point, are related to individuals who acquired the unusual _E. coli_
isolate in Germany prior to travel.

The antimicrobial resistance pattern of this isolate is also quite
unusual. This could reflect the use of antimicrobial agents in the
feed of the original host animals. It should be stated, however, that
antimicrobials should be not be empirically used in VTEC infections
since the use increases the risk for HUS. It is not stated if
antimicrobial use was a factor in the prominent risk of HUS in this
outbreak.

The absence of intimin-production in the isolate is also uncommon as
the protein is an adherence factor important in virulence. The eae
designation stands for _E. coli_ attaching and effacing. - Mod.LL]

The _E. coli_ outbreak in Germany is spreading, with several new
cases reported on Fri 27 May 2011. Consumers are still being advised
to exercise caution with raw vegetables.

The German institute responsible for disease control and prevention
has reported 60 new cases of severe infection with the _E. coli_
bacterium.

The director of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Reinhard Burger,
told the news show "Morgenmagazin" on ARD television that the patients
were suffering from hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).

On Thu 26 May 2011, the Hamburg Institute for Hygiene identified
cucumbers from Spain as the source of the outbreak. The Spanish health
ministry has launched an investigation. Officials said authorities had
contacted 2 farms in the provinces of Malaga and Almeria, where the
cucumbers are believed to have come from.

However, the ministry also said a contamination within Germany itself
could not be ruled out. This possibility was also mentioned by the
managing director of one of the farms, who claimed that a load of
cucumbers fell on the ground on the way to the Hamburg wholesale
market.

The RKI says that the current _E. coli_ outbreak is the worst ever on
record in Germany, with more people infected in a week than otherwise
in an entire year.

Cucumbers from Spain have been confirmed as one of the sources
responsible for an outbreak in Germany of _E. coli_ [O140], a
potentially lethal food borne bacteria, the European Commission said
Thu 26 May 2011.

The EU executive said it had notified the 27 members of the European
Union "about one of the confirmed sources responsible" for the
outbreak, principally in Germany where it is blamed for 2 deaths
[other reports have put the death toll at 3 or 4 - Mod.LL], but also
in Sweden, Denmark, Britain, and the Netherlands.

A commission statement said it had been informed by the German
authorities late Thu 26 May 2011, that they had identified organic
cucumbers from 2 provinces of Spain, Almeria and Malaga, as one of the
sources. A 3rd suspect batch of cucumbers from the Netherlands, but
traded in Germany, was under investigation while German authorities
continue to seek to identify other potential sources.

The commission earlier urged people who recently visited Germany to
watch for symptoms such as bloody diarrhea. "People who have recently
visited Germany should pay attention to symptoms, such as bloody
diarrhea, and accordingly consult their physician," said Frederic
Vincent, the commission spokesman for health issues. The commission
stressed that it was "essential" to rapidly identify potential cases
"to prevent the development of severe disease."

The commission said 214 cases of hemolytic-uremic syndrome had been
recorded in Germany, with 68 percent concerning women. Sweden has
reported 10, Denmark 4, Britain 3, and the Netherlands 1.

[4] UK: additional imported cases
Date: Fri 27 May 2011

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1391526/Cucumber-E-coli-2-people-Britain-diagnosed-5-killed-Germany.html?ITO=1490


Two people have been diagnosed in Britain with the _E. coli_ strain
that has already claimed 5 lives in Germany.

The 2 UK victims are Germans who traveled from their homeland and
fell ill after entering Britain. There is a 3rd suspected case but it
has yet to be confirmed. Although the infection can be passed
person-to-person through hand-to-mouth contact the Health Protection
Agency [HPA] said there was no evidence of any such secondary
infections.

It is understood the suspect salad items have not been sold in the UK
but the HPA said checks are ongoing. They added that the outbreak is
mainly affecting adults, almost 70 per cent of whom are women.
