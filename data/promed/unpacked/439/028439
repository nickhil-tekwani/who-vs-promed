Health Canada Tags Edmonton Area the Meningitis Capital of the Nation
-----------------------------------------------
Edmonton is the meningitis capital of the nation, according to Health
Canada. The Capital Health Region's 50 cases of meningitis since Dec 1999
-- 3 fatal -- make an "outbreak" for an urban area the size of Edmonton's,
said Theresa Tam, medical epidemiologist for Health Canada.
"Nationally the rate for meningitis is one per 100 000 people, so for a
city like Edmonton you would expect to see maybe 8 cases a year," Tam
said. "50 is a much higher than usual number. That is about 6 cases per
100 000 people in a year when the national average was 0.7 per 100
000. That isn't a cluster of the disease -- it's an outbreak."
Last November, Capital Health immunized 59 600 children and young adults
with meningitis vaccines to try to curb the disease. "The campaign was
because the numbers were so much higher than we would normally see," Tam said.
Dr. Vinod Dhawan, chief of infectious diseases at the Martin Luther King
Jr. General Hospital in Los Angeles, said 6 meningitis cases per 100 000
people is cause for concern. "That seems to be very high . . . we haven't
seem numbers like that in a while," Dhawan said.
Although none of the Capital Health Region's cases were connected by a
neighbourhood or school, the disease was being spread from person to person
throughout the region, Tam said. "It was being spread around some way and
it's not a bacterium that is spread easily." In 1992 there were cluster
outbreaks in Ottawa and Montreal that sparked vaccination campaigns, but
the numbers weren't as bad as in Edmonton over the last year, Tam added.
Dr. Gerry Predy, medical officer of health for the Capital Health Region,
says he hopes we've seen the last of the outbreak here. "We had an unusual
number of cases for many months and then the numbers dropped off in the
summer and picked right back up again," Predy said. "We are hoping to see
the end of it in the next few weeks."
Tests done on Edmonton's meningitis cases show there was a unique strain of
meningitis being spread throughout the city, he said. "The organism
circulating here was different than we have seen before. The subtle
genetic changes may have led to the situation we had last year." Local
meningitis experts are conducting tests on the Edmonton strain of disease.
"Meningitis is something we will never get rid of but hopefully the test
result will be of value fighting the disease."

[ProMED-mail would like to receive more information on the outbreak. More
epidemiologic information on the cases (age and vaccination history) and
more laboratory information on the strain of bacteria involved would be of
interest and help in interpreting the significance of this reported
outbreak. - Mod.MPP]
