--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
"Background: The relative contributions of asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have not been clearly measured although control measures may differ in response to the risk of spread posed by different types of cases.

"Methods: We collected detailed information on transmission events and symptom status based on laboratory-confirmed patient data and contact tracing data from 4 provinces and one municipality in China. We estimated the variation in risk of transmission over time, and the severity of 2ary infections, by symptomatic status of the infector.

"Results: There were 393 symptomatic index cases with 3136 close contacts and 185 asymptomatic index cases with 1078 close contacts included into the study. The 2ary attack rate among close contacts of symptomatic and asymptomatic index cases were 4.1% (128/3136) and 1.1% (12/1078), respectively, corresponding to a higher transmission risk from symptomatic cases than from asymptomatic cases (OR: 3.79, 95% CI: 2.06, 6.95). Approximately 25% (32/128) and 50% (6/12) of the infected close contacts were asymptomatic from symptomatic and asymptomatic index cases, respectively, while more than one 3rd (38%) of the infections in the close contacts of symptomatic cases were attributable to exposure to the index cases before symptom onset. Infected contacts of asymptomatic index cases were more likely to be asymptomatic and less likely to be severe.

"Conclusions: Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission play an important role in spreading infection, although asymptomatic cases pose a lower risk of transmission than symptomatic cases. Early case detection and effective test-and-trace measures are important to reduce transmission. Our study illustrated that the risk of transmission varied according to the symptom profile of COVID19 cases. Asymptomatic cases transmitted infection to their close contacts at a lower risk than cases presenting symptoms. Pre-symptomatic transmissions accounted for more than one 3rd of the infections occurred from exposure to symptomatic cases. Risk of transmission was relatively higher within households or through shared dining than other social settings. Active case finding with increased testing capacity could help to reduce transmission from symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. Social distancing measures and facemask wearing might not be sufficient to prevent infection from spreading in settings where these measures could not be maintained."

[Transmission without symptoms poses challenges for identifying the infectious timeline and potential exposures. [If individuals] do not know they're infected, they may likely mingle with others, promoting virus spread. They may also not adhere to masking, distancing, hand hygiene, and staying at home [Thus the problem of dining, drinking with family, friends. - Mod LK].

Though the prevalence of asymptomatic cases is not accurately reported, early studies showed that these cases accounted for about 30 to 80% of infections. Recent evidence reports a rate of asymptomatic cases between 17 and 30%.

In COVID-19 patients with symptoms, the infectious period starts two days before symptom onset and for several days after. There is also reduced viral shedding within the 1st week of symptom onset. In asymptomatic cases, viral shedding kinetics is not well understood. During early infection, people have similar viral loads, regardless of symptom severity. People without symptoms have reduced titers at peak replication and faster viral clearance, making the infectious period shorter.

Hence, measuring the true impact of asymptomatic spread is crucial, though it can be perplexing. Some studies revealed that symptomless individuals were 42% less likely to transmit the virus and have lower 2ary attack rates. Other studies have noted that despite the shorter infectious period, virus transmissibility is similar for those with presymptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.

"With many contagious people experiencing no symptoms and in the absence of robust surveillance testing for asymptomatic or presymptomatic infections, it is critical to maximizing efforts to reduce transmission risk in the community," the researchers noted in the study.

They added that the lack of testing and isolation of asymptomatic cases could result in surging cases. Governments must impose extensive testing and surveillance to detect even those without symptoms. This way, infected individuals will be isolated appropriately, reducing the risk of viral transmission.

"Until there is widespread implementation of robust surveillance and epidemiological measures that allow us to put out these smokeless fires, the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be fully extinguished," the team added.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
In 2020, the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, caused a pandemic, which is still raging at the time of writing this. Many countries have set up high throughput RT-qPCR based diagnostics for people with COVID-19 symptoms and for the wider population. In addition, with the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) new lineages of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified that have been associated with increased transmissibility or altered vaccine efficacy, so-called Variants of Concern (VoC). WGS is generally too labor intensive and expensive to be applied to all positive samples from the diagnostic tests, and often has a turnaround time too long to enable VoC focused contact tracing. Here, we propose to use Sanger sequencing for the detection of common variants of concern and key mutations in early 2021, using a single set of the recognized ARTIC Network primers. The proposed setup relies entirely on materials and methods already in use in diagnostic RT-qPCR labs and on existing infrastructure from companies that have specialized in cheap and rapid turnaround Sanger sequencing. In addition, we provide an automated mutation calling software (https://github.com/kblin/covid-spike-classification). We have validated the setup on 195 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, and we were able to profile over 85% of RT-qPCR positive samples, where the last 15% largely stem from samples with low viral count. At approximately 4 EUR per sample in material cost, with minimal hands-on time, little data handling, and a turnaround time of less than 30 hours, the setup is simple enough to be implemented in any SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR diagnostic lab. Our protocol provides results that can be used to focus contact-tracing efforts and it is cheap enough for the tracking and surveillance of all positive samples for emerging variants such as B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 as of [January 2021].

[B] Antigen detecting rapid diagnostic tests
Date: Sun 28 Mar 2021

ref: Haage V, Ferreira de Oliveira-Filho E, Moreira-Soto A, et al. Impaired performance of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests at elevated and low temperatures. J Clin Virol. 2021; 138:104796. <doi: 10.1016/j.jcv.2021.104796>. [Online ahead of print]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) can complement molecular diagnostics for COVID-19. The recommended temperature for storage of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs ranges between 2-30 deg C. In the global South, mean temperatures can exceed 30 deg C. In the global North, Ag-RDTs are often used in external testing facilities at low ambient temperatures. We assessed analytical sensitivity and specificity of 11 commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using different storage and operational temperatures, including short- or long-term storage and operation at recommended temperatures or at either 2-4 deg C or at 37 deg C. The limits of detection of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs under recommended conditions ranged from 1.0x10(6)- 5.5x10(7) genome copies/mL of infectious SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatant. Despite long-term storage at recommended conditions, 10 min pre-incubation of Ag-RDTs and testing at 37 deg C resulted in about 10-fold reduced sensitivity for 5 out of 11 SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs, including both Ag-RDTs currently listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization. After 3 weeks of storage at 37 deg C, 8 of the 11 SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs exhibited about 10-fold reduced sensitivity. Specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using cell culture supernatant from common respiratory viruses was not affected by storage and testing at 37 deg C, whereas false-positive results occurred at outside temperatures of 2-4 deg C for 2 out of 6 tested Ag-RDTs, again including an Ag-RDT recommended by the WHO. In summary, elevated temperatures impair sensitivity, whereas low temperatures impair specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs. Consequences may include false-negative test results at clinically relevant virus concentrations compatible with transmission and false-positive results entailing unwarranted quarantine assignments. Storage and operation of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs at recommended conditions is essential for successful usage during the pandemic.

[The clinical performance of antigen diagnostic tests largely depends on the circumstances in which they are used. Both antigen tests and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) perform best when the person is tested when viral load is generally highest. They also may be informative in diagnostic testing situations in which the person has a known exposure to a person with COVID-19. There are increasing amounts of data to help guide the use of antigen tests as screening tests on asymptomatic persons to detect or exclude COVID-19, or to determine whether a person who previously was diagnosed with COVID-19 remains infectious.

It is important for clinicians and testing personnel to understand the analytic performance characteristics, including sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values, of the particular antigen test being used, and to follow the manufacturer's instructions and package insert. The "gold standard" for clinical diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2 remains NAATs, such as RT-PCR. Thus, it may be necessary to confirm an antigen test result with a nucleic acid amplification test, especially if the result of the antigen test is inconsistent with the clinical context.

The sensitivity of antigen tests varies but is generally lower than most NAATs. The antigen level in specimens collected either before symptom onset, or late in the course of infection, may be below the limit of detection of virus of the test. This may result in a negative antigen test result, while a more sensitive test, such as most NAATs, may return a positive result.

The specificity of antigen tests is generally as high as most NAATs, which means that false positive test results are unlikely when an antigen test is used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Despite the high specificity of antigen tests, false positive results will occur, especially when used in communities where the prevalence of infection is low - a circumstance that is true for all in vitro diagnostic tests.

[3] Philippines: lockdown
Date: Mon 29 Mar 2021
Source: Bloomberg [abridged, edited]
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-29/philippine-capital-returns-into-lockdown-as-vaccinations-lag


The Philippines' key economic area plunged back into another lockdown for a week starting [Mon 29 Mar 2021] as the Southeast Asian nation faces its worst coronavirus surge and a slow vaccine rollout.

Metro Manila and the adjacent provinces of Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna and Rizal were placed under enhanced community quarantine or ECQ, the nation's strictest classification of movement curbs, from [29 Mar to 4 Apr 2021]. A curfew from 6pm -- 5am will be imposed during the lockdown.

President Rodrigo Duterte may announce later in the day if the lockdown will be extended, his spokesman Harry Roque said at a briefing [Mon 29 Mar 2021], adding that economic impact will be balanced with further stemming the outbreak. "We can't let more people die of hunger and other reasons in our effort to lower Covid-19 cases," Roque said.

The economic impact of the stay-home order is expected to be minimal as offices and financial markets will be shut on 1 and 2 Apr for the Easter holiday, Roque said on [Sat 27 Mar 2021].

"Our main objective why we're closing down again is to make our healthcare system more manageable," Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said at a virtual briefing [Mon 29 Mar 2021]. "Our emergency rooms and intensive care units are choking."

The government will tap 23 billion pesos (USD 475 million) in unused funds from last year's [2020] relief measure to aid millions affected by the lockdown, Budget Secretary Wendel Avisado said [Mon 29 Mar 2021]. Economic managers will also meet to discuss "ways forward" amid the surge in infections, he said.

Recession
---------
Before the lockdown, authorities tightened mobility in the capital and the surrounding provinces for 2 weeks from [22 Mar 2021] but cases continued to spike, hitting a record 10 016 on [Mon 29 Mar 2021]. Daily infections have risen more than 5 times from the start of the year, while the percentage of people testing Covid-19 positive rose to nearly 20% on [Sun 28 Mar 2021] from about 7% in January [2021].

Moody's Investors Service said the spike in coronavirus infections delays the country's economic recovery, it said in a [26 Mar 2021] note. Pandemic containment measures implemented earlier this month [March 2021] are also expected to weigh on prospects of fiscal consolidation and exacerbate income equality and poverty, the rating agency said.

The Philippines, which implemented one of the world's strictest and longest lockdowns last year [2020], suffered its worst-ever recession in 2020, prompting economic managers to push for a sustained reopening and targeted restrictions rather than a hard lockdown.

Infections are rising globally even as countries ramp up vaccinations amid efforts to reopen economies and revive social activities. In the Philippines, less than a 3rd of the 1.7 million health workers had been inoculated as of [23 Mar 2021], while the country has received more than 1.1 million vaccine doses. One million Sinovac Biotech Ltd. vaccines are scheduled to arrive on [Mon 29 Mar 2021], while around 1 million from AstraZeneca Plc are expected to arrive in the coming weeks.

The Philippines is behind its Southeast Asian neighbors like Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia in inoculations, based on World Bank data. The Philippines has administered 0.2 vaccine doses per 100 people as of mid-[March 2021], compared to Singapore's 13.5 doses.

Stay Home
---------
Similar to the strict lockdown imposed a year ago, only essential industries including hospitals and food manufacturers are allowed to operate at full capacity. People must work from home, may only leave for essentials and are barred from holding mass gatherings.

Malls are shut, except for tenants such as pharmacies, hardware stores, supermarkets and businesses engaged in food delivery and takeout. Public transport including trains are allowed to run at limited capacity.

The capital region, with a population of about 13 million, accounts for nearly half of the nation's total virus cases.
