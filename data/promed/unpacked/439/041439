A confirmed case of wild poliovirus [infection] has been discovered
in Dange/Shuni local government Area of Sokoto State, paralyzing a
9-month-old baby. The type 1 wild poliovirus is the most dangerous
and feared case which is capable of paralyzing children.

Though the country has yet to record any type 1 wild poliovirus cases
this year (2010), this is however the 1st in 6 months bringing the
number to 3 cases of polio in 2010, compared with 240 for the same
period in 2009.

The Daily Trust [newspaper] had reported that the remaining 2 cases
of type 3 wild poliovirus were discovered in Anka local government
area (LGA) of Zamfara and Bomadi LGA of Delta State, on 9 Apr and 3
Jan 2010 respectively. Speaking on the issue, Dr Mohammed Ali Pate,
executive director National Primary Health Care Development Agency
(NPHCDA), said that drastic and immediate measures have already been
put in place to interrupt the spread of the deadly virus.

He said the NPHCDA is working closely with states and local
authorities, traditional leaders, and other partners to fully
investigate and determine the risks to children in the Dange/Shuni
LGA and adjoining areas. The NPHCDA has placed Kebbi and Zamfara
states on increased alert for polio cases, with a polio vaccination
campaign planned across 20 Northern states from 5-8 Jun 2010.

Meanwhile the 9-month-old boy in Dange/Shuni LGA experienced
paralysis in his left leg following a fever on 18 Apr 2010.

[According to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (18 Apr 2010)
cases of poliovirus infection have plummeted in Nigeria. As countries
across west and central Africa prepare for cross-border synchronized
campaigns to vaccinate some 85 million children under the age of 5
against polio, cases in Nigeria continue to plummet. As of 13 Apr
2010, Nigeria had reported one case of polio in 2010, compared to 171
at the same time last year [2009]. In order to capitalize on this
progress, during 4 days last month [April 2010], Nigeria immunized
over 45.5 million children. Maintaining the gains in Nigeria is
crucial to finally kick polio out of the African continent (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/LatestNews201004.asp#01>).
