HESKA OBTAINS EXCLUSIVE LICENSE FOR CAT SCRATCH DISEASE VACCINE TECHNOLOGIES
FORT COLLINS, Colorado - Heska Corporation (Nasdaq: HSKA) announced today
that it has obtained an exclusive license for the use of _Bartonella
henselae_ as a vaccine against Cat Scratch Disease from the United States
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. Cat Scratch
Disease is caused by the bacterium _Bartonella henselae_ that is
transmitted from cats to humans by a cat's scratch or other means.
CDC holds patents in this area, as investigators at CDC were the first to
identify _Bartonella henselae_ as the causative agent of Cat Scratch
Disease. Heska's license, which covers not only use of the bacterium but
also of portions of the bacterium, will convert to a non-exclusive license
at the conclusion of the exclusive term.
Cat Scratch Disease can cause skin inflammation, mild fever and swollen
lymph nodes in healthy people following infection. In immunocompromised
people, such as the very young, older people or HIV-positive individuals,
Cat Scratch Disease may result in a life-threatening but curable infection.
Due to the potential severity of this disease, doctors may recommend to
at-risk individuals that cats be removed from the household.
The Company believes that over 22,000 cases of Cat Scratch Disease in
humans are reported each year.
Dr. Robert Grieve, Heska's chief scientific officer said, "Cat Scratch
Disease can be a serious disease in humans and annually results in more
hospitalizations than some more well known infectious diseases, such as
Lyme disease. We have been working closely with scientists at CDC to
develop a vaccine that is intended to prevent cats from harboring the
bacteria in their blood. Our goal is to limit the potential for
transmission of the bacteria from cats to humans. This is a good example of
Heska's efforts to develop products that will secure the relationship
between owners and their valued companion animal family members."

[As there are three separate strains of _B. henselae_ without cross
immunity, or so I am informed by my colleagues researching this disease,
one wonders which strain the Heska vaccine covers. - Mod.MHJ
