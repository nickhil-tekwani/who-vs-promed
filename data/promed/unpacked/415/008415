Uganda: Cholera Death Toll Rises
--------------------------------
The cholera death toll in Butaleja District has risen to 8 after 4 more cases were reported this week. Dr John Matovu, the Butaleja District health officer, told Daily Monitor on Tuesday, 5 Apr 2016, that 4 deaths at 2 health centres and 2 others had been reported.

He said the 1st case was reported last week and they had initiated a unit to respond. The team is led by the district health officer and the district health inspector, Mr Henry Isogoli. The 4, according to Dr Matovu are among the 25 patients who had been admitted to the various rural health facilities across Butaleja District.

"The situation is getting out of hand and this calls for more intervention," Dr Matovu said, adding they continue to receive complaints from residents, who have lost their relatives, of being stigmatized.

"The way cholera is spreading in the district is worrying both district health department and residents and this has to be blamed on lack of sanitary facilities such as pit-latrines in most homes," said Dr Matovu.

According to available data, the 1st suspected case was reported in Nabiganda Trading Centre, Kachonga Sub-county. Mr Michael Higenyi Boole, the Butaleja District vice chairperson, said many people who had been affected had attributed the illness to witchcraft, which in turn affected both treatment and response plans.

Ebonyi State Commissioner for Health, Dr Daniel Umezurike, on Wednesday, 6 Apr 2016, disclosed that the outbreak of cholera in the state has killed over 76 people. Briefing newsmen, the Commissioner noted that 38 communities and 11 out of the 13 local government areas [LGAs] of the state were affected by the cholera outbreak.

The Commissioner further disclosed that over 76 persons had died in 38 communities across 11 local government areas of the state since the outbreak of cholera in February 2015 and that within 5 months of its outbreak only 2 LGAs, Afikpo North and Onicha, were not affected by the epidemic.

Cholera Cases Rise to 585 Cases
-------------------------------
The cholera count has hit 585 across the country as the Ministry of Health tries to arrest the situation.

Lusaka has recorded 16 more cases while so far 6 deaths have been recorded with Lusaka still topping the occurrence record. Lusaka Province District Health Director Kennedy Malama said the cases reported at Kanyama and Bauleni were from across Lusaka but the treatment centres were in these 2 spots.

Dr Malama said the perception that cholera was only in Bauleni and Kanyama was wrong as the 2 places housed the treatment centres.

So far the Copperbelt has only recorded 1 case which was in Ndola.

[5] Diarrhea - Nepal (Jajarkot District)

The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Wednesday, 6 Apr 2016, urged the government to pay attention towards increasing cases of diarrhea in Dasera VDC of Jajarkot. Saying that its serious attention has been drawn to the issue, the NHRC has urged the government to dispatch a medical team as soon as possible to prevent it from being an epidemic. It also requested for necessary investigation to find out causes behind the outbreak and to act promptly and effectively to solve the problem. The NHRC has also asked the government to make medicines available to the locals free of cost.

In the past few days, more than 40 people including School Level Certificate examinees and invigilators were hit from the disease in the district. The NHRC also recalled the deaths of hundreds of locals in the district due to the same disease in past few years.

[6] Cholera - Iraq (Basra Governorate)
Date: Fri 8 Apr 2016

A member of the Basra [Al Basrah] Governorate Council, Nazim Namr, warned of the spread of cholera in Al-Dair sub-district, north of the governorate, after recording serious cases in the sub-district where around 200 000 persons live.

Namr said that the information he has received indicates the presence of cholera cases in hospitals. He explained that during his recent visit to Basra he had informed the concerned authorities, including the Prime Minister, of exacerbation of the situation in the sub-district and the spread of diseases including cholera.

Namr attributed this to the lack of a project of sewage and wastewater treatment plant. He added that there is a project for this purpose that is worth about 30 billion dinars (USD 2.7 million), but it has started to be demolished as it was never completed.

The member of the council indicated that sewage is drained to agricultural lands, besides having a village in the sub-district that lacks potable water and people using water from the river for all purposes while sewage water is drained into this river.

It is worth mentioning that the Basra Directorate of Health announced on 21 Sep 2015 that the governorate had not recorded any case of cholera after taking a series of preventive measures that had limited the spread of the disease, particularly in terms of monitoring water bottling factories and transport of water in tanker trucks.

[Cholera is considered to be an endemic disease in many parts of Iraq where outbreaks usually occur in summer-autumn seasons.

The 2015 cholera epidemic in Iraq occurred from mid September to early December 2015. According to WHO, 4945 confirmed cases were reported during the 2015 epidemic and most cases were recorded in Baghdad and Babil governorates. In Basra, 102 confirmed cases were recorded.

The report above primarily warns of a possible cholera outbreak in Al-Dair sub-district due to lack of a proper sewage system. The report also indirectly refers to having cholera cases in hospitals, but it does not provide enough information to confirm that. No health authorities have responded to these claims so far. - Mod.NS]

[The mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical Pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), 2014, Nova Science Publishers, 2015, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
