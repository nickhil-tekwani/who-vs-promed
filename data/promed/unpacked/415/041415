Over this past year, 53 people have died from malaria, 51 from
Grande-Comore and 2 from Anjouan, and no fatal cases have been
registered on the island of Moheli. No fatalities have been registered
between March 2010 and April 2011 according to the annual report of
the National Fight Against Malaria (PNLP), just published in Moroni.

According to the report, 103 670 cases have already been registered
this year [2011], of which 76 060 were from Grande Comore, the largest
island in the Comores, followed by 24 050 cases on Anjoun and 3350
cases at Moheli, the smallest of the islands.

The PNLP is surprised over the increase in the number of cases
compared to last year [2010], when a total of 57 084 cases were
registered in the Comores Islands.

"The previous data are not reliable. The present data are more
reliable," says Dr Timothe Guilavogui, the epidemiologist responsible
for entomological services on the islands. According to Guilavogui,
the distribution of impregnated mosquito nets and free Coartem, the
anti-malarial drug presently used in the Comores Islands, would be
expected to result in a reduction of malaria cases.

Malaria was responsible for 36 percent of outpatient visits compared
to 41 percent in 2007 and 50 percent in 2004.

Between March 2010 and April 2011, 20 639 cases of severe malaria
were registered from the 3 islands of the Comores.

41 percent of malaria cases are seen in children below 5 years of
age, and 81 percent of children less than 5 years experienced an
attack of malaria over the last year, according to the PNLP.

[The Comores Islands had an estimated population of 681 000 in 2010.
The number of reported cases during the 1st 6 months of 2011 is
equivalent to 300 cases per 1000 population per year, which is very
high. The increase shows that control efforts using impregnated bed
nets and free Coartem are not working.

It is surprising that the numbers of fatal cases are not higher, but
there may be considerable underreporting.
