Bali records its 18th rabies fatality of 2011
---------------------------------------------
A 39 year old Klungkung man has died at Bali's Sanglah General
Hospital of rabies. The man, who was a father of 2, was admitted to
the hospital on Thu 4 Aug 2011 and died the following day. According
to the Bali Post [newspaper], the man was the 18th fatality attributed
to rabies in Bali in 2011. The victim was reportedly bitten several
months ago by a puppy purchased in Denpasar. The victim reportedly
killed the dog when a better course of action might have been to
isolate the animal for observation to determine signs of rabies
[presumably to confirm the need for post-exposure prophylaxis?]. Upon
arrival at the hospital, the man exhibited symptoms consistent with
rabies, a diagnosis that must be finally confirmed via laboratory
tests now under way.

Dr Nyoman Sutedja, the head of the Bali Health Service, said that in
order for Bali to rid itself of rabies within 2 years time and be
certified as "rabies free" it must pass a 2 year period with no new
confirmed cases.

Government data shows a decline in dog bites incidents in July 2011.
Although daily reports number above 100. The daily rate of reported
"bites" island-wide appears on a downward trend with 164 in January,
161 in February, 167 in March, 171 in June, and 134 in July.

[The death of the latest rabies victim, the 18th in 2011, has still to
be formally confirmed by laboratory diagnosis. The number of human
case of rabies in Bali remains high but may now be in decline.
However, the figures for (daily) frequencies of dog-bite hardly
substantiate the claim of a downward trend.
