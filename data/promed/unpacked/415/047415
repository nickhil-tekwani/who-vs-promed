After confirming 27 cases of cryptosporidiosis and rumors that the infection
had infected as many as one-third of the patrons of the city's swimming
pools in Melbourne, Victoria, public health officials closed four public
pools during the past week and advised those who suffer a prolonged bout of
diarrhea to be tested for infection by the parasite.
Two of the pools were reopened after extensive disinfection, but because
the parasite is resistant to chlorine and slips through pool filtration
systems parents have been requested to keep young children not fully
toilet-trained out of the pools.
Outbreaks have been reported in Canberra -ACT, Queensland and New South Wales.
