A gastrointestinal virus outbreak that has sickened dozens of people in a
Belmont senior living center may have also struck at 3 medical facilities
in San Mateo County, causing up to 45 other people to become ill, county
health officials said today [Tue 12 Dec 2006].
However, doctors said they do not believe the highly contagious virus is
any more common this winter than in years past, but rather is being
reported more. Twenty-five people -- 12 patients and 13 staff -- have
become sick from norovirus infection in the county-run San Mateo Medical
Center's long term care wing, officials said. At 2 undisclosed locations --
a skilled nursing facility and an assisted living facility -- another 21
people have fallen ill, officials said. There are 412 residents living
between those 2 facilities.
The announcement at a press conference this morning follows a decision by
health officials on Friday [9 Dec 2006] to quarantine Bonnie Brae Terrace,
an independent living center in Belmont that houses 164 seniors. About 85
people became sick with norovirus there, including at least 3 staff.
Norovirus spreads quickly and easily through food or drink that has been
handled by someone fighting the bug; it can also be spread by contact with
doorknobs, toilet handles, or other surfaces touched by someone who has
been vomiting or suffering from diarrhea. Noroviruses typically cause a
one- or 2-day bout of vomiting and diarrhea, often accompanied by mild
fever, headache, muscle ache, and fatigue. They are more dangerous in
nursing home or hospital settings, where patients in frail health can
become gravely ill.
Officials have established similar procedures at all of the locations in
which they believe outbreaks have occurred: isolating the patients and
asking infected staff to stay home. "We're telling them to close the dining
room, the meeting rooms, and cancel social activities," said county health
department official Dr Alvaro Garza. At the Medical Center, new patients
are not being admitted to the long-term care wing, he said. Staff at the
facilities are also being asked to wear gowns, gloves, and masks, he said.
Garza said the quarantines seem to be effective, noting that the number of
new cases has plummeted significantly since Bonnie Brae's took effect
Friday. Twenty-four cases were reported there between Thursday and Friday,
for example, while only one new case was found on Monday. The quarantine
will be lifted 72 hours after the 1st day in which there are no new cases.
"We're preventing a lot of disease," he said, adding that the virus usually
surfaces from October to April. "I don't think (the outbreaks) are unusual
-- it's the season for norovirus." Garza said 320 cases were reported from
January to April of this year; 166 were reported in all of 2005. But
officials believe reporting has simply increased, he said. Health officials
said they have also notified emergency rooms countywide of the outbreak.

[The opinion expressed here that the frequency of norovirus outbreaks is no
greater than in previous years, and that only reporting has improved, runs
counter to the situation in Europe -- where surveillance is coordinated
over a wide are, is not restricted to health care facilities, and there is
convincing evidence of strain evolution - Mod.CP]
