BOTULISM BELIEVED TO BE CAUSE OF BIRD DIE-OFF AT ILLINOIS RIVER NATIONAL
WILDLIFE REFUGE
Oct. 8/97
FORT SNELLING, Minn., -- Avian botulism is believed to have killed about
5,600 birds at the Chautauqua National Wildlife Refuge, administered by
Illinois River National Wildlife and Fish Refuges, near Havana, Illinois,
according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service. However, the Service is
making every effort to get the outbreak under control.
"The key to controlling this outbreak is to pick up and dispose of as many
dead birds as possible," said acting refuge manager Russell Engelke.
"By late Monday, we had cleaned up the entire lake. We are finding fewer
and fewer birds each day, and we will continue to go out and pick up birds
until we don't find any more."
Dead birds were initially reported by a volunteer on the refuge's Lake
Chautauqua on October 2. Refuge personnel collected the birds and sent
them to the National Wildlife Health Center, of the U.S. Geological
Survey, in Madison, Wis. Early tests ruled out other infectious diseases,
and botulism tests are continuing. A wildlife disease specialist from the
center is at the refuge to conduct further tests.
"We are fairly confident this is a case of avian botulism," said Engelke.
"The conditions to produce the disease are present here, and the appearance
of the birds we've collected seems to point to botulism."
A bacteria (_Clostridium botulinum_) produces a toxin that when ingested
causes avian botulism, type C. This bacteria is commonly found in soils
and mud along lakes and rivers. When water levels drop, temperatures rise,
and oxygen is no longer present, the bacteria reproduce, generating the
toxin. Waterfowl and shorebirds are affected when they ingest toxin while
feeding in these areas. The disease can spread quickly when healthy birds
feed on maggots on infected carcasses, prompting the extensive efforts to
remove dead birds.
Engelke is receiving assistance from the Illinois Department of Natural
Resources, which is providing personnel and an airboat, and from personnel
at Mark Twain National Wildlife Refuge. Most of the birds collected, about
3,500, are green-winged teal. Other species affected include mallards,
pintails, Canada geese, shorebirds, and blue-winged teal. Carcasses are
being buried to prevent spread of the disease.
Lake Chautauqua is about 2,000 acres in size, although due to lowered water
levels, only about 200 acres is open water. The remainder is moist soil
areas and vegetation. Engelke says he is letting as much water as
possible onto the lake from a nearby creek in an effort to dilute the toxin
and cover exposed mud flats. Personnel in airboats are also hazing the
birds to keep them away from the lake.
Engelke says the outbreak has not affected visitation at the refuge. The
area around Lake Chautauqua is closed at this time of year for maintenance
of levees. Duck hunting, to begin October 18 outside the levees on the
Illinois River, will not be affected.
Avian botulism can affect any bird species, although it is most often seen
in waterfowl and shorebirds. The disease is not always fatal, but smaller
species such as teal are generally at greater risk. Birds die when they
lose control of muscles enabling them to fly, breathe, and they can drown
when they can no longer hold their heads up. Type C, or avian botulism is
rarely a threat to humans, who are more often affected by Type A, B, or E,
sometimes found in improperly canned food.
[This problem commonly occurs during the fall. Although many previous
reports have come from California, botulism in waterfowl can occur
anywhere. The initial mortalities are usually due to environmental
conditions i.e. drought. However, the key to control of this disease is
prompt removal of carcasses so that bacterial toxins aren't elaborated in
dead birds which then feeds the outbreak.- Mod. pc
