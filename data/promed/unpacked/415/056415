More than 50 camels have died of an unconfirmed viral disease over the
past 2 weeks, and about 1000 are suffering from it in Thar region,
according to an estimate.

The animals started dying after they returned from a camel market set
up during the annual Urs celebration of Sufi saint Saman Sarkar near
Badin 2 weeks ago. They suffered bleeding from the nose accompanied by
coughing and finally died. According to camel breeders and traders,
more than 50 animals have died so far.

Jan Mohammad Samoon, activist of a local NGO, Aware, said that private
veterinary doctors had diagnosed the disease as a viral infection
caused by Congo virus [probably related to Crimean Congo hemorrhagic
fever, CCHF; see commentary].

He said that villagers were trying to save the diseased camels through
traditional methods, and in many cases were administering them opium,
but to no avail.

In the absence of a government veterinary doctor or team, the camel
owners were forced to take their animals to private veterinarians who
charged them Rs 1000 [USD 11.70] per camel, Mr Samoon said.

EDO (agriculture) Ghulamullah Jarwar denied reports of the outbreak of
viral disease and said that a small number of animals were found
diseased on their return from the Urs of Saman Sarkar, but they
recovered soon through antibiotics.

He said that about 200 dispensaries and veterinary clinics were
functioning in Thar and teams were visiting villages after getting
reports of the disease. He believed it was just a flu and said samples
were sent to Tando Jam laboratory for further analysis.

In Thar, a camel is used for travelling in the desert, fetching water,
transporting loads and luggage, ploughing and recreational activities,
and the price of a prized camel runs into Rs 150 000 to 200 000 [USD
1758.50 to 2344.67]. There are on average 20 to 50 camels in each Thar
village, according to the 1998 census.

[The suggested involvement of CCHF virus in camel disease seems
unlikely; this virus is known not to cause clinical disease in
livestock. Its mentioning in the above newswire is probably echoing
CCHF cases in humans, reported from Pakistan recently.

Pakistan's camel population (2009 figures) is 930 000. A significant
part of them are situated in the arid Thar desert, which is divided
between Pakistan (southeast) and western India.

More accurate and detailed epidemiological information from reliable,
professional sources on the allegedly affected camels in the location
described, including laboratory results if available, will be
appreciated.
