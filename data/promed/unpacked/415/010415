Doctors have diagnosed 16 new cases of tonsillitis in the town of Cospeito [province of Lugo, Galicia], after 60 additional pediatric consultations on Wed 7 Oct 2015, and after a massive outbreak was detected in the Virxe do Carme school.

According to the regional government, tonsillitis is a mild bacterial condition caused by a streptococcus, and the affected children are responding well to treatment with antibiotics.

The Regional Health Department reported that the health center diagnosed the 1st cases on 27 Sep 2015, but it was not until the concentration [of cases] on Monday morning [5 Oct 2015], that the situation was reported for its singularity.

On that day, 67 students went to the pediatrics department and 65 of them tested positive for the streptococcus infection. Students are gradually returning to the classroom, but on Wed 7 Oct 2015, just over half of them were still missing. On Tue 6 Oct 2015, 98 students attended their classes, and on Wed 7 Oct 2015, 109 of the 233 students from different grades were at school.

In addition, the Territorial Delegation of the government of the autonomous community of Galicia in Lugo pointed out that the department of pediatrics diagnosed 2 cases of scarlet fever among students at the school. Scarlet fever is also a condition that is not serious and requires the same antibiotic treatment prescribed for tonsillitis.

The school will continue to take extreme hygiene measures, as it did from the moment it became aware of the problem, to reduce the chance of infection. Among other measures, drinking glasses were given to all the children in order to avoid sharing bottles, drinking from faucets, or any other risky behavior.

The territorial delegate in Lugo, Raquel Arias, explained that it appears "the outbreak of tonsillitis in the Virxe do Carme school is past its peak," and noted that "the gradual return of the students to their classrooms is expected."

[Group A streptococcal (GAS) are the most common cause of streptococcal pharyngitis. Groups C and G streptococci less commonly cause streptococcal pharyngitis. (The news report above fails to say if the cause of the outbreak is GAS or a non-GAS, but 2 of the students developed scarlet fever, which is caused by GAS.) Streptococcal pharyngitis is usually thought to spread person-to-person by airborne respiratory droplets; however contaminated food can also be a source of groups A and G streptococcal pharyngitis, especially in outbreak settings. Streptococci may originate from the throat or from wounds on the hands of a food-handler. Food-borne GAS and group G pharyngitis outbreaks have been characterized by abrupt onset, high attack rates (50-90 percent), and prominent pharyngeal symptoms. There may be secondary spread among contacts. Cold salads, usually those that contain eggs, are now frequently implicated; raw milk, often originating from cows with streptococcal mastitis, a common source of food-born outbreaks in the past, is now unusual since pasteurization of milk has become a common practice.

Food-borne transmission should be considered when large clusters of streptococcal pharyngitis occur. Molecular typing of streptococcal isolates from patients and food can facilitate understanding the mode of transmission.
