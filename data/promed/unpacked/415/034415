Cattle rarely contract rabies, but some states have reported cases this year [2020], including one each in Minnesota and Texas, and 2 in Oklahoma.

The cases in Oklahoma are concerning, according to the Oklahoma Department of Health, as the state had already confirmed 20 cases of rabies by early June 2020, nearly equaling the total 24 cases the state confirmed in 2019.

Nationwide, a total of 33 rabid cattle were reported in 2018, representing a 8.3% decrease from 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These are the most recent figures to date from the CDC.

While it's impractical to vaccinate a herd of cattle, those animals in regular contact with humans -- such as dairy cattle, show animals, and horses -- should be vaccinated, Barry Whitworth, Oklahoma State University Extension veterinarian and food quality and health specialist, recommended in a university distributed press release.

He says there are 2 forms of rabies people tend to think of: one is what he describes as "furious." Animals suffering from this expression of rabies will be restless, wander, vocalize, drool and attack anything in sight. Infected animals that are normally nocturnal may be seen during the day. Convulsions in the late stages of the disease are common, and those creatures usually die 4-8 days after showing clinical signs.

The 2nd form of rabies is expressed as progressive paralysis. In those animals, the throat is paralyzed, and the animal cannot swallow or vocalize normally, Whitworth says. Cattle might have a high-pitched bellow or be silent when they attempt to bellow. Rumination will cease, which may result in bloat. They also may appear to be straining to urinate or defecate and may have difficulty walking.

"It's easy to mistake this form for a digestive or urinary problem, or possibly a female animal is aborting," Whitworth said in the release.

"Animals infected with the paralytic form of rabies usually die in 2 to 6 days from respiratory failure."

More details about the disease are available online via an OSU Extension fact sheet and in a YouTube video featuring Whitworth produced as part of OSU Extension's award-winning SUNUP television program.

The CDC makes the following recommendations for addressing livestock exposed to rabies:

1. If up to date for the rabies vaccination, livestock having been exposed to a rabid animal should be revaccinated immediately with a rabies vaccine and observed for 45 days.

2. Unvaccinated livestock exposed to rabies should be euthanized immediately. If the animal is not euthanized, it should be kept under close observation for 6 months. Any illness in an animal under observation should be reported immediately to the local health department. If the animal develops signs suggestive of rabies, it should be euthanized and tested.

[2] Canada - New Brunswick, raccoon, child exposure

Last week, 2 New Brunswick children received preventative treatment after coming into contact with a baby raccoon testing positive for rabies in Charlotte County, N.B.

The raccoon kit was "acting abnormally docile," according to Melanie Sivret, a spokesperson for the province. The children encountered the animal in an individual's yard.

Sivret said the family involved was made aware of the raccoon's positive test result, and the 2 children received precautionary care. [Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) was likely given; however, this newswire does not report whether the animal bit or scratched them. Saliva from the animal introduced into a cut or the eye would still be a rabies exposure and need PEP. - Mod.TG]

The likelihood of transmission in this case was low, she said in an emailed statement to Global News. But the incident should remind parents to teach their children not to handle wild animals, Sivret added.

"Rabies is deadly for wild animals and family pets. The disease can also kill people if they are exposed and are not treated promptly," the province said.

[Rabies in cattle is a very real problem for producers. The article describes a bellow the animals make. When I heard an animal with this bellow, it reminded me of something from a horror movie, not something from a bovine, in this case a bull. The frenzied bellow of a rabies-affected bovine is a very odd sound. The bull was humanely euthanized, and the brain sent for testing. The brain tested rabies positive.

The article says it is not practical to vaccine a whole herd. Depending on the size of the herd, it may be practical. If there are several rabid animals in the area, it doesn't take much for a skunk to wander through a herd and nip several bovines (bulls, cows or calves) on the nose. The bovine is a curious animal wanting to know what this strange creature waddling through their domain is, so they put their noses down to investigate and are rewarded with a nip, inoculating the bovine with rabies.

If your bovine is a dairy animal or a show animal, then please vaccine them against rabies. The same is true with horses. Large animals can do a tremendous amount of damage to the human body when the animals attack you. When this disease affects the animals' brains, there is no longer any concept that you may be the one providing them food, or love, but rather you are a strange creature to the rabies affected brain.

The article from Canada clearly illustrates that even very young animals can have rabies. We have seen this a number of times with postings about puppies and kittens. The same is true of the young offspring of other animals.

Likely, these children received post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) against rabies.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. PEP will protect you from developing rabies, and, therefore, you cannot expose other people to rabies. You can continue to participate in your normal activities; https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html. - Mod.TG
