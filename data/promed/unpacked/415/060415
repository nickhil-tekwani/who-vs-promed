[Since 18 Dec 2011, when the current epizootic started, Libya has reported to the OIE 38 outbreaks of FMD serotype O, including the 9 covered in the current follow-up No. 3 report, and one single outbreak caused by FMDV serotype SAT 2.

For a map showing the 38 FMDV-O outbreaks, see http://tinyurl.com/c8k9jx2.
For a map showing the location of the SAT2 outbreak, see http://tinyurl.com/bostgtt.

The current O strain is highly infective and pathogenic (see mortality rates), spreading in spite of vaccinations with the available vaccine. The SAT 2 strain seems to be much milder, while no vaccinations against this strain have been performed. It seems that the Libyan authorities attribute, at least partly, the massive spread of the O strain to it being "airborne." This statement is in need of clarification. In view of the assumed absence in Libya of the most prolific emitters of FMD virus particles, namely pigs, airborne transmission over meaningful distances is significantly less likely than spread through the uncontrolled movements of animals and by the mechanical transfer of the virus by 3rd parties such as humans, articles, forage, vehicles etc.

According to the genotyping results of WRLFMD, the current Libyan O strain belongs to topotype ME-SA, strain PanAsia-2 ANT 10. For details and a dendrogram, see http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2012/WRLFMD-2012-00005%20O%20Libya%202011-2012.pdf and
http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2012/WRLFMD-2012-00010%20O%20Libya%202012.pdf.

According to the genotyping results of WRLFMD, the current Libyan SAT2 strain belongs to topotype VII, while the strain is "unnamed." The WRLFMD indicated that while both the Libyan and the Egyptian strains are topotype VII, the Libyan strain belongs to a lineage which was distinctly different from the 2 Egyptian lineages. For the details of the Libyan SAT 2 strain, including a dendrogram, see http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2012/WRLFMD-2012-00010%20SAT2%20Libya%202012.pdf. - Mod.AS]
