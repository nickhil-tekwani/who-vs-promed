Connecticut woman dies of inhalation anthrax
--------------------------------------------
DERBY, Connecticut (CNN) -- An elderly Connecticut woman diagnosed with
inhalation anthrax died [on Wednesday, becoming the fifth such fatality
since several anthrax-laced letters began turning up in the mail last
month. The new case puzzles investigators because she had no known
connection to government offices, postal facilities, or news outlets, which
have been tied to all but one of the other 17 anthrax cases.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has launched a criminal
investigation and is trying to track the woman's movements over the past
month to determine how she may have come in contact with the deadly
bacteria. Authorities are operating on the premise that she contracted
anthrax via cross-contamination through the mail. No suspicious letter,
however, has been found at her home.
One possibility investigators are considering is that the Connecticut woman
may have received contaminated mail from Washington [presumably DC -
Mod.SH where several government offices, including a large postal
distribution center, have been contaminated with anthrax.
This was the first anthrax case in Connecticut and the first in the United
States in about 3 weeks. The deceased woman lived alone in Oxford, a small
town of 2000 in the southwestern part of the state, and had a limited
social life, officials said. [She appeared to be suffering from an
upper-respiratory tract infection and a family member took her to the
Griffin Hospital emergency room in Derby on Friday, said Patrick Charmel,
the hospital's president. Her symptoms, including a rapid deterioration in
her condition, led doctors to suspect anthrax.
Investigators from the FBI and the Connecticut State Police have sealed off
the woman's house in Oxford, and are questioning friends and family members
to trace her recent movements. Lisa Bull, an FBI spokeswoman in
Connecticut, said investigators are "trying to button down a timeline going
back approximately 30 days" for the deceased woman.
The governor said that 2 postal facilities sent mail to the woman's address
in Oxford. "We checked both the Seymour and Wallingford post offices as
late as 11 November to determine if there were any anthrax traces," he
said. "Both of them came up clean. So we're going to go back to those 2
post offices, and we will also make available antibiotics to any of the
postal workers in those two facilities" and to the employees at the beauty
salon the woman frequented.

[Several callers have suggested that this might just be a background case.
If so, this would necessitate an aerosol exposure, which is hard to
imagine, even if reject dirty wool had been used as ceiling or wall
insulation in her house. There has been little livestock anthrax east of
the Mississippi in decades. This possibility would begin to stand up if the
strain identification was other than "Ames" and a strain associated with
imported wools; Oxford is an old mill town. If it is "Ames" it had to be
brought to the deceased woman. - Mod.MHJ
