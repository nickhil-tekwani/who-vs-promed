An outbreak of avian botulism will result in extreme bird deaths
around Alberta lakes, warned the experts. The disease is already
blamed for bird deaths on Utikuma Lake north of Lesser Slave Lake, and
Pakowki Lake as well, south of Medicine Hat. However, the carcasses
have not appeared to cause any deaths among humans.

The warmer weather of [this] month [August 2011] has contributed
enough to provide feasible environment for the outbreak along with
formation of blue-green algae blooms on lakes. In addition, the algae
decomposition is likely to produce a toxin capable of affecting fish
and birds and in some cases may also distress humans. Consequently,
the government has placed warnings in areas where water quality
becomes unsafe.

"With heavy rain falls and shallow lakes, there is a bacterium that
creates the botulism toxin and it can get into insects," notified
Darcy Whiteside, Spokesman for Alberta Sustainable Resource
Development. "The birds eat the maggots and then it builds up and
basically kills the birds. The numbers of deaths can get pretty high,
into the thousands in some of the larger lakes."

The outbreaks are triggered naturally having an influence from
increased rainfalls and warmer temperature. Authorities in Alberta
have outlined policies to monitor blue-green algae blooms.

[When there is enough of proper nutrients in the water and conditions
are correct there can be a bloom of toxic algae, generally blue-green
algae. Blue-green algae can be very toxic and can cause sudden death
in animals consuming the water.

When an animal dies and the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_ grows
and produces the botulinum toxin, then flies lay eggs. The maggots
bioaccumulate the botulism toxin. Other birds eat the maggots and
become affected by botulism. Consequently, unless dead carcasses are
picked up, then the cycle continues.

Let us hope the dead birds and fish or other animals around these
water sources are quickly cleaned up. - Mod.TG]
