The Israel Nature and Parks Authority has banned bathing in 2 rivers in the north of the country [Hazafon/Northern district] after over a dozen swimmers fell ill with symptoms feared to be leptospirosis, a bacterial disease that can be fatal.

The Zavitan and Zaki streams have both been placed off limits by the authority until further notice.

Some 25 people, including 12 Israeli soldiers, have been hospitalized after displaying symptoms of the disease, according to Army Radio.

Leptospirosis is transmitted to humans via the urine of mammals, usually from rats or mice, but also dogs, deer, cows, and sheep. While the bacteria don't harm the host animal, in humans they can cause flu-like symptoms, including fever and chills, intense headaches, stomach pain, and conjunctivitis, in milder forms. In a more severe form, it can degenerate into Weil's disease, which causes liver damage, kidney failure, bleeding in the lungs and meningitis, and can been fatal if left without treatment.

According to a report by the Walla news site, last week [week of 6 Aug 2018] 12 IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers were sent for medical checks after feeling unwell following a hike through the Zaki stream. The incident was reported to the Health Ministry. The Health Ministry has said it is investigating the cases, adding that the source is apparently water pools in the Golan Heights.

The Israeli Ministry of Health warned the public on [Mon 13 Aug 2018] against swimming in streams in the Golan Heights after it emerged that almost 30 people caught a bacterial infection after bathing in the waters.

So far, 27 people who have visited Yehudiya, Zaki, Zavitan, and Meshishim streams since [1 Jul 2018] have caught the infection known as leptospirosis, with half of them still hospitalized. Hundreds more who visited the streams are expected to be examined, the ministry said.

The Israel Nature and Parks Authority announced that the streams suspected of being infected are closed to visitors until further notice due to Ministry of Health order.

Other streams in northern Israel have been given the all clear and remain open to visitors, the Nature and Parks Authority said, adding that "the public is invited to come and enjoy parks. The parks authority will remain in contact with relevant ministries, follow their orders and monitor water quality."

As of [Sat 12 Aug 2018], 8 patients had arrived at the Ziv Medical Center in Safed, another 8 at Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, 4 at the Poriya Baruch Padeh Medical Center in Tiberias, and 1 at both Rambam Medical Center in Haifa and HaEmek Medical Center in Afula. Another 4 patients arrived at the Carmel Medical Center after bathing in the Golan Heights streams.

A 19-year-old man from Kfar Hasidim and a 25-year-old woman from Ramat Yishay were hospitalized after bathing in Meshushim pool. The man was treated and discharged while the woman was still said to have been suffering from abdominal pain -- one of the symptoms of the infection -- and remains under supervision.

The other 2 at the Carmel Medical Center also said they had bathed in one of the affected streams a week ago and had begun suffering symptoms of leptospirosis in the last few days.

Prof Michal Hovers, who runs the infectious diseases unit in Meir Hospital in Kfar Saba, explained how leptospirosis infects the streams and described its main symptoms. "Animals infected the waters and streams, and people who either bathe there or come into contact with mice urine in outdoor habitats can catch this infection," she said in an interview with Ynet. "Symptoms can be mild in some cases but in others the infection can become severe and lead to kidney and liver failure," she continued. Prof Hovers added that symptoms include fever, flu-like symptoms, and sometimes corneal infections but emphasized that not all symptoms require admission to hospital. "Mild cases can heal without intervention, and thus not everyone who bathed in the streams and who has a fever has to rush to the hospital," she noted. "However, if high temperatures persist and someone doesn't feel well, it is better to go and get a blood test in order to ensure that liver and kidney functions are in order, and take antibiotics if needed," she explained.

Prof Grotto said lab results from several streams would be received [Wed 15 Aug 2018], and that the Health Ministry would then make the decision whether to close more water bodies to the public.

In the meantime, he stressed, it is advised not to swim in streams and water bodies without a strong current. He said the only solution to the contamination is strong currents due to significant rain.

Asked if access to the streams could be blocked until December or January [2019], Grotto said, "It's possible; maybe there will be rain before that, I don't know."

On [Wed 15 Aug 2018] a central Israel hospital said that 5 teenagers had arrived with suspected leptospirosis after kayaking in the Jordan River, raising concerns that one of Israel's main water bodies had been contaminated.

The Mayanei Hayeshua Medical Center in Bnei Brak said the high school students, 14 to 17 years old, had fallen ill 2 weeks after visiting the kayaking site north of the Sea of Galilee, and it was expecting more patients with similar symptoms.

In response, kayaking company Abu Kayak criticized the hospital for its "irresponsible announcement," which had caused damage to its business and "defamed" the firm.

"The water hasn't been examined and there is no indication this is leptospirosis," it said in a statement.

The Health Ministry confirmed on [Tue 14 Aug 2018] that at least 12 people had been diagnosed with the disease, and more than 50 others are awaiting test results to confirm they have been infected.

Leptospirosis is transmitted to humans via the urine of mammals, usually from rats or mice, but also dogs, deer, cows, and sheep. While the bacteria do not harm the host animal, in humans they can cause flu-like symptoms, including fever and chills, intense headaches, stomach pain and conjunctivitis, in milder forms. In a more severe form, it can degenerate into Weil's disease, which causes liver damage, kidney failure, bleeding in the lungs and meningitis, and can been fatal if left without treatment.

Health experts quoted by Ynet said they suspected the outbreak of the disease was caused by the large number of wild boars in the Golan, coupled with a persistent drought in recent years that has driven them to huddle continuously next to streams and urinate in them.

Dr Doron Tiomkin told the outlet that there have been many recent cases of pregnancy loss among cows in the Golan, and that the cause has been determined to be various forms of leptospirosis, especially one that originates in wild boars and other wild animals.

Meanwhile, one of Israel's main mineral water companies, Mey Eden, said it has stopped pumping water from one of its sources, the Salukia Spring in the Golan, after the water was found to be contaminated in recent days.

But the company denied reports that this has affected its supply to customers, saying it was continuing to market water as usual from water tanks in its factory in the town of Katzrin.

The Health Ministry has previously called on anyone who swam in the infected streams on or after [1 Jul 2018], and who has had a fever of more than 38 C [100.4 F] in the past 3 weeks, to see their family doctor as soon as possible.

Other symptoms mentioned by the ministry -- also typical of the common flu -- are headaches and muscle pain. Some may also suffer liver or kidney diseases, it added.

A health official said [Wed 15 Aug 2018] that authorities were considering closing off more rivers and streams in the Golan Heights -- including the Jordan River -- possibly for months, as more people were hospitalized with a bacterial infection that has turned into a major scare.

The Israel Nature and Parks Authority earlier this week banned bathing in the Zavitan, Zaki, Yehudia, and Meshushim streams until further notice, after dozens of swimmers fell ill with symptoms feared to be leptospirosis, a bacterial disease that can be fatal and is transmitted via animal urine.

Prof Itamar Grotto, deputy director general of the Health Ministry, told the Ynet news site that the Jordan River and its tributaries -- the Hasbani River, Banias stream, and Dan River -- could be contaminated.

"Right now it isn't certain," he said. "If anyone is in doubt then of course don't go in."

Prof Grotto said lab results from several streams would be received [Wed 15 Aug 2018], and that the Health Ministry would then make the decision whether to close more water bodies to the public.

In the meantime, he stressed, it is advised not to swim in streams and water bodies without a strong current. He said the only solution to the contamination is strong currents due to significant rain.

[According to a press release of the Ministry of Health (updated afternoon [Tue] 14 Aug 2018), "the disease has been confirmed in samples from several patients". (in Hebrew, https://www.health.gov.il/NewsAndEvents/SpokemanMesseges/Pages/14082018_1.aspx). - Mod.AS]

[The Golan Heights has several hiking paths through streams and pools that attract many travelers. Yehudiya Nature Reserve is the largest nature reserve in the Golan Heights (see map at https://goo.gl/maps/wshPXRS9hDK2). There are 6 streams in the reserve through which water flows year-round: Qazrin, Zavitan, Yehudiya, Batra, and Daliyot (http://www.beentheredonethattrips.com/yehudiya-and-zavitan-route-87-golan-heights/). Zaki stream hike is 4 km (2.5 mi) that involves 1.5 km (1 mi) of wading and swimming in streams and lagoons (https://hike-israel.com/hikes/wet-summer-hikes/zaki-stream/ and https://www.israel-travel-secrets.com/zaki-trail/). The Meshishim Nature Reserve is a small pool in the southwest of the Golan Heights (see map at https://goo.gl/maps/BXovfW2zom22).

Leptospirosis is caused by exposure to _Leptospira_ bacteria in fresh (not salty) water, wet soil, or vegetation that has been contaminated by urine of animals chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira interrogans_. Rodents, dogs, cattle, and pigs are the usual reservoirs for this organism.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals; for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Leptospirosis is also a risk during recreational activities such as camping, fresh water swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from leptospire-infected animals, as well as a risk from household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents. - Mod.ML
