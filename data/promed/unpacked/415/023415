[1] Vaccine adverse effect: cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopenia
[1a] J&J response to vaccine concern

All adenoviral vector vaccine platforms are not the same, and the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine may have different biologic characteristics and biologic effects than the AstraZeneca vaccine, researchers from Johnson & Johnson's Janssen unit argued.

In a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine published Friday [16 Apr 2021], Macaya Douoguih, MD, of Janssen Vaccines and Prevention in the Netherlands, and colleagues responded to a case report on one of the 6 U.S. cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) with thrombocytopenia associated with the vaccine, published in NEJM on Wednesday [14 Apr 2021] [see Comment section below].

Not surprisingly, Douoguih's group asserted the cases were "insufficient evidence" of a causal relationship between the J&J vaccine and CVST with thrombocytopenia, claiming the rate occurs within the expected background rate for this "extremely rare" event. However, they went further, attempting to distance their adverse events from those associated with AstraZeneca's vaccine.

Douoguih and colleagues rejected the theory of a class effect, noting that the vectors and spike protein inserts in the 2 vaccines are "substantially different. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a human Ad.26-based vector, whereas AstraZeneca uses a chimpanzee adenovirus-based vector, ChAdOx1."

Because they use different species of adenovirus, "these 2 vectors use different host cell receptors and are likely to have different phylogenetic and biologic characteristics." They also "may have quite different biologic effects," Douoguih and colleagues argued.

They noted that the one case of CVST with thrombocytopenia in a vaccine recipient during a phase III trial was judged to be unrelated to the vaccine, though they added that the recipient was found to have antibodies against platelet factor 4. The authors acknowledged the pause on the vaccine instituted by the FDA and CDC on 13 Apr [2021] and continued by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on 14 Apr [2021]. (Another ACIP meeting to discuss the issue is set for 23 Apr [2021].)

However, many more cases of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia were linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. Data presented by CDC at ACIP indicated 79 cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, with 19 fatalities, including 44 cases of CVST with 14 fatalities in the U.K. There were also 62 cases of CVST and 24 cases of splanchnic vein thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, and 18 fatalities in the European Union.

During a call with clinicians on Thursday [15 Apr 2021], CDC staff acknowledged they are "still learning the extent to which those cases [after the Johnson & Johnson vaccine] represent the same syndrome" as cases associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Adding to cases already reported from Germany, Austria, and Norway, Marie Scully, MD, of University College London Hospital's NHS Foundation Trust, and colleagues, reported findings in NEJM about 23 patients presenting with thrombosis and thrombocytopenia 6-24 days after receiving the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. Similar to in prior research, 21 of 23 patients tested positive for antibodies to platelet factor 4 unrelated to use of heparin therapy. Median age was 46, though patients ranged from ages 21-77. Sixteen patients were younger than 50, and 14 were women. One patient had a history of deep venous thrombosis, and one was taking oral contraceptives.

Thirteen patients had clinical features consistent with cerebral venous thrombosis, 4 had pulmonary embolism, 2 had an ischemic stroke affecting the middle cerebral artery territory, and 2 had portal vein thrombosis.

Interestingly, the authors reported all patients had D-dimer levels much higher than patients with acute venous thromboembolism, levels "typically seen in patients with cancer." All patients had low or normal fibrinogen levels.

The authors cautioned that these patients should not be treated with transfusions, "because such treatment would provide a substrate for further antibody-mediated platelet activation and coagulopathy."

Seven patients died, and available postmortem results revealed evidence of thrombosis in the lungs, intestines, cerebral veins, and venous sinuses, and evidence of extensive intracerebral hemorrhage.

An accompanying editorial by Douglas Cines, MD, of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and James Bussel, MD, of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, raises a number of questions, including, "What components or components of the vaccine ... elicit a new (or recall) response to a seemingly unrelated host protein, PF4?"

Cines and Bussel also posed a chicken-or-the-egg question: "Is PF4 a bystander component within an immune complex that activates platelets, or does it contribute directly to clot propagation?"

"Detailed study of anti-PF4 antibodies after natural infection and in recipients of each of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may provide insight into the risk of [vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia] and into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the condition," the editorialists wrote. "The next step should be a direct demonstration that the anti-PF4 antibodies described here cause thrombosis and thrombocytopenia in an in vivo model."

[Ref: Sadoff J, et al.: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia after Ad26.COV2.S Vaccination -- Response from the Manufacturer. NEJM. 16 Apr 2021; DOI: 10.1056/NEJMc2106075; https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2106075

A case report by Muir et al.[1] describes thrombosis, including cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), associated with severe thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation in a recipient of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Johnson & Johnson/Janssen) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Among the more than 75 000 participants in the clinical trial program for our Janssen Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (of which approximately 50 000 received active vaccine), a single case of CVST with thrombocytopenia occurred in a vaccine recipient. We paused our program to review this case from our 1st phase 3 study; after consultation with external clinical experts, no clear causality was established, and the data and safety monitoring board agreed that we could restart the study. The vaccine recipient was subsequently found to have had antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) at the time of the event, a finding similar to that in the case described by Muir and colleagues. As part of our postauthorization pharmacovigilance program, Janssen ongoing safety surveillance received reports of 6 cases of CVST with thrombocytopenia occurring 7-14 days after vaccination, including the case described by Muir et al. On 13 Apr [2021], in an abundance of caution, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended a pause in vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S in the United States to allow further study of the situation and to provide physicians guidance on the diagnosis, treatment, and reporting of CVST in combination with low platelets[2]. These cases were reported among more than 7.2 million persons who had been vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S globally as of 14 Apr 2021[3]. Thus, the reporting rate is less than 1 in 1 million vaccinations, though it is possible that the cases are underreported.

At this time, evidence is insufficient to establish a causal relationship between these events and the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. CVST is a very rare health condition[4], and thus far, events reported in recipients of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine are occurring within the range of published background incidence (0.2-1.57 per 100 000 person-years)[4,5]. It is important to note that the incidence of CVST associated with low platelets is unknown and is considered by the FDA and the CDC to be extremely low[2].

Muir, et al. suggested that coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines using an adenoviral (Ad) vector platform may be related to the occurrence of thrombotic thrombocytopenia. Recent reports by Greinacher, et al. and Schultz, et al. (both published on 9 Apr 2021, at <NEJM.org>) concluded that vaccination with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (Oxford-AstraZeneca) may lead to rare thrombotic thrombocytopenia (see references S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter, at <NEJM.org>). The vectors and spike (S) protein inserts used in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine are substantially different. The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine uses a human Ad26-based vector, whereas the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine uses a chimpanzee adenovirus-based vector (references S3 and S4). Ad26 is from Ad species D and can engage CD46 as its cellular receptor, whereas ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is from Ad species E and uses the Coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) and possibly other molecules as its cellular receptors; these 2 vectors thus use different host cell receptors and are likely to have different phylogenetic and biologic characteristics. In addition, the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine transgene codes for a membrane-bound SARS-CoV-2 S protein (prefusion conformation-stabilized by 2 proline substitutions) that does not shed S1, most likely as a consequence of knocking out the furin cleavage site (reference S5), which is different from the unmodified S protein encoded by the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Therefore, these 2 adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccines may have quite different biologic effects. More evidence is needed to clarify the observation of thrombotic thrombocytopenia in persons receiving a vaccine against COVID-19.

We continue to work closely with experts and regulators to assess the data, and we support the open communication of this information to health-care professionals and the public.

Dear Moderator,

I write with regards the above item, specifically on

"[C] Thrombotic thrombocytopenia
Date: Wed 14 Apr 2021

"The J&J vaccine uses broadly similar vaccine technology as the AstraZeneca vaccine, known as adenoviral vectors, which has led some experts to speculate there might be a link between this vaccine platform and the very rare blood-clotting condition known as "vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia" (VITT). There are important questions to look into: Can adenoviral vectors in general cause VITT? Is VITT specific to the AstraZeneca/J&J adenoviral vaccines? Are certain individuals pre-disposed to develop VITT?"

My comment is:
While it is quite possible that the VITT may be triggered by the 2 adenovirus vectors, Chimpanzee type 5 and human type 26, I have not heard about any human adenovirus infection leading to VITT or similar blood-clotting cascade problems. Chimp adeno experience had been small until Chadox roll-out. So we do not know. But human adeno 26 is an old and well-known human infectious agent. Had we been missing its pathogenic property?

US army has immense experience injecting adeno vaccines in service recruits. Never heard of such serious AEFI. So I am reluctant to take at face value the role of the vector -- I may be completely wrong by missing something somewhere.

I am aware of triggering of intussusception by some Rotavirus vaccines but not others, while wild Rotaviruses have not been a cause of intussusception. So you need not have clear pathogenetic similarity for triggering pathology.

On the other hand, there is striking similarity to the coagulation cascade pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and the VITT. That begs the question, Could the spike protein itself be involved? Could the VITT be an incomplete form (forme fruste) of COVID?

To take that possibility forward, we must look at the manner in which the spike protein is made and displayed on cell surfaces: Which cells? What non-immunological reactions to cell surface displayed S protein may induce? How much of spike proteins per cell and per unit length of vasculature? What effect on the manipulations of spike protein by the 2 vaccine designs? Do secreted or cell-displayed spike protein adhere to ACE-2 receptors? What effect may follow ACE-2-spike binding? Does VITT exhibit dose-response dynamics? Does 2nd dose have same or lower or higher probability to 1st dose?

Knowing that no vector adenovirus replicates in human cells, the likelihood of the relatively small numbers of adenovirus particles in the vaccine causing VITT seems a bit far-fetched, but not impossible.

We should know who all are NOT likely to develop thrombocytopenia/VITT so that the Chadox and adeno-26 COVID vaccines can be safely given to them. We also need to know if either of these is given as 2nd dose but not as 1st dose (which may be mRNA, peptide, inactivated virion) the problem is mitigated or minimised.

I have no access to research or data mining, so I write to stimulate those who have them to explore the biology of this serious AEFI. Such science-based explanations are important to allay anxiety of those who accept vaccination hiding their palpitation.

[ProMED thanks Dr. John for his well-considered response to the rare but concerning adverse events following immunization with the adenovirus-based vaccines. A separate response by J&J published in NEJM in the post above also states "the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine transgene codes for a membrane-bound SARS-CoV-2 S protein (prefusion conformation-stabilized by 2 proline substitutions) that does not shed S1, most likely as a consequence of knocking out the furin cleavage site (reference S5), which is different from the unmodified S protein encoded by the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Therefore, these 2 adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccines may have quite different biologic effects." Both Dr. John's response and the J&J response focus on the S protein rather than the adenovirus vector. - Mod.LK]

[1c] Risk of virus-associated cerebral thrombosis vs vaccines
Date: Thu 15 Apr 2021
Source: University of Oxford [edited]
https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-04-15-risk-rare-blood-clotting-higher-covid-19-vaccines


Researchers at the University of Oxford have today Thu 15 Apr 2021] reported that the risk of the rare blood clotting known as cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) following COVID-19 infection is around 100 times greater than normal, several times higher than it is post-vaccination or following influenza.

The study authors, led by Professor Paul Harrison and Dr Maxime Taquet from Oxford University's Department of Psychiatry and the NIHR Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre, counted the number of CVT cases diagnosed in the 2 weeks following diagnosis of COVID-19, or after the 1st dose of a vaccine. They then compared these to calculated incidences of CVT following influenza, and the background level in the general population.

They report that CVT is more common after COVID-19 than in any of the comparison groups, with 30% of these cases occurring in the under 30s. Compared to the current COVID-19 vaccines, this risk is between 8-10 times higher, and compared to the baseline, approximately 100 times higher.

The breakdown comparison for reported cases of CVT in COVID-19 patients in comparison to CVT cases in those who received a COVID-19 vaccine is as follows:

- In this study of over 500 000 COVID-19 patients, CVT occurred in 39 in a million patients.
- In over 480 000 people receiving a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna), CVT occurred in 4 in a million.
- CVT has been reported to occur in about 5 in a million people after 1st dose of the AZ-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine.
- Compared to the mRNA vaccines, the risk of a CVT from COVID-19 is about 10 times greater.
- Compared to the AZ-Oxford vaccine, the risk of a CVT from COVID-19 is about 8 times greater.

However, all comparisons must be interpreted cautiously since data are still accruing.

Paul Harrison, Professor of Psychiatry and Head of the Translational Neurobiology Group at the University of Oxford, said, "There are concerns about possible associations between vaccines, and CVT, causing governments and regulators to restrict the use of certain vaccines. Yet, one key question remained unknown: What is the risk of CVT following a diagnosis of COVID-19?
We've reached 2 important conclusions. Firstly, COVID-19 markedly increases the risk of CVT, adding to the list of blood-clotting problems this infection causes. Secondly, the COVID-19 risk is higher than we see with the current vaccines, even for those under 30, something that should be taken into account when considering the balances between risks and benefits for vaccination."

Dr Maxime Taquet, also from the Translational Neurobiology Group, said, "It's important to note that this data should be interpreted cautiously, especially since the data on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine come from EMA monitoring, whereas the other data uses the TriNetX electronic health records network. However, the signals that COVID-19 is linked to CVT, as well as portal vein thrombosis -- a clotting disorder of the liver -- is clear, and one we should take note of."

An important factor that requires further research is whether COVID-19 and vaccines lead to CVT by the same or different mechanisms. There may also be under-reporting or miscoding of CVT in medical records, and therefore uncertainty as to the precision of the results.

Full data are available from the OSF website.

[2] Thrombotic effects of SARS-CoV-2
Date: Wed 14 Apr 2021
Source: Fiocruz [edited]
https://portal.fiocruz.br/en/news/covid-19-article-defends-new-classification-disease


COVID-19: article defends a new classification for the disease
--------------------------------------------
Many viruses can hamper coagulation, including those that cause dengue fever and yellow fever. In more severe cases, they may lead to bleeding. This is why these diseases are considered hemorrhagic viral fevers. In a paper recently published in the science magazine "Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz," a group of 10 researchers argues that the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) should be the 1st agent recognized as acting in the opposite fashion, by increasing the formation of blood clots (also called thrombi) that can obstruct blood flow. Taking into account available evidence of hypercoagulation in the disease, the authors propose that COVID-19 is the 1st infection classified as thrombotic viral fever. The disease is currently classified as a severe acute respiratory syndrome.

The paper is signed by specialists in intensive care, cardiology, hematology, virology, pathology, immunology, and molecular biology who work in 6 medical service and scientific research institutions in Brazil. Namely: Hospital Pro-Cardiaco, Oswaldo Cruz Institute (IOC/Fiocruz), Medical School of Petropolis (Unifase), Brazilian National Cancer Institute (Inca), Carlos Chagas Institute (Fiocruz-Parana), and United Health Group. The laboratories of the IOC that participated in the paper are the Compared and Environmental Virology, the AIDS and Molecular Immunology, the Inflammation Laboratory, and the Pathology and Immunopharmacology Lab.

Scientific evidence
Almost a year after the appearance of the new coronavirus in China, several studies have demonstrated that, unlike what was initially thought, COVID-19 goes way beyond pulmonary issues. In the Netherlands, a survey identified complications related to the excessive formation of blood clots in 16% of patients in intensive care units, including cases of pulmonary embolism, stroke, and venous thrombosis. In a French survey this rate exceeded 40%. In addition, tests made on people who died of the infection showed significant damage to the epithelium, the tissue that lines the inside of blood vessels. Surveys show that the SARS-CoV-2 infects endothelial cells, and tissue inflammation promotes hypercoagulation.

"In hospitalized patients we observe thrombotic manifestations in spite of the usual clinical practice of thromboprophylaxis [clot-preventing therapy]. There are also descriptions of thromboembolic events after hospital leave, and an excessive formation of blood clots is observed in histopathological tests carried out on cases of death by COVID-19," states Rubens Costa Filho, coordinator of the ICU of Hospital Pro-Cardiaco and lead author of the paper.

For the authors of the paper, the classification as thrombotic viral fever reflects the advancement in the knowledge available on the disease and can help with the clinical management of the cases and with scientific research. "This definition shines a light on the need for measures to monitor and treat coagulation alterations, and points to issues that still need to be clarified, such as the identification of severety biomarkers that can be used to guide therapeutic approaches," says Jose Paulo Gagliardi Leite, researcher of the Compared and Environmental Virology Laboratory of the IOC and senior author of the article. The researchers also explain that a change in classification would not impact the current monitoring systems that help define public health strategies. "SARS is a term used to describe a non-specific clinical issue, as it can include a series of different manifestations. A thrombotic viral fever, on the other hand, would represent a specific syndrome. This definition is crucial in the field of health," Costa Filho emphasizes.

Diagnosis and therapeutic target
In addition to collecting scientific evidence on hypercoagulation in COVID-19, the paper discusses the advantages and limitations of the tests available to diagnose the problem, and points to a promising goal in the search for treatments. From among different tests, the researchers draw attention to the potential of an old and easily available methodology: rotational thromboelastometry. In use since the 1940s, the test assesses the viscoelastic properties of the blood, analyzing the interaction between platelets, blood cells, and coagulation factors. Recent studies show that the technique can detect hypercoagulation in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.

"Assessing coagulation parameters is at least as important as evaluating respiratory parameters in COVID-19 patients. Thromboelastometry is an old and neglected diagnostic method that should be used in these cases," states Marcelo Pelajo Machado, head of the IOC's Pathology Laboratory and author of the paper.

As potential therapeutic target, the paper mentions a viral enzyme called Mpro. The starting point of the proposal is the high level of similarity between the enzyme and molecules that activate blood coagulation. This was discovered in a study led by Tatiana Brasil de Souza, researcher of the Structural and Computational Proteomics Laboratory of Fiocruz-Parana.

"In the computational triage of drugs with therapeutic potential against the SARS-CoV-2, we observed that the substances with best interactions with Mpro were anticoagulants. This led us to research the structure of the enzyme, and we then found a preserved region that is very similar to thrombin and factor X, substances that activate blood clotting," says the researcher, who published the results of the work last June [2020], in "Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz."

Based on this finding, the researchers are now planning to carry out experiments to assess whether MPro can contribute with the hypercoagulation condition in COVID-19 patients. "It is possible that this protein works as a propulsion drive for thrombotic phenomena, and this is the hypothesis we will be investigating," says Hugo Castro Faria Neto, researcher at the IOC's Immunopharmacology Laboratory.

In the biology of the SARS-CoV-2, MPro is in charge of snipping proteins, and its action is crucial to assemble new viral particles. In laboratory settings, studies have already shown that inhibiting the enzyme prevents the virus from replicating. "COVID-19 patients still suffer with a lack of specific treatments. A drug that acts on MPro might work against the infection and have a protective effect against thrombosis," adds Hugo.

A complex disease
The researchers emphasize that COVID-19 is a complex disease, with manifestations in several organs, from the brain to the gastrointestinal tract. The classification as thrombotic viral fever is based on the proven impact of the infection on blood coagulation, leading to a high risk of death. However, other components of the disease must not be forgotten.

"Pulmonary issues are certainly very relevant in COVID-19. What the paper emphasizes is that in the most severe cases, the ones that are hard to treat, with great inflammatory exacerbation, coagulopathy is present," says Marco Aurelio Martins, researcher of the IOC's Inflammation Laboratory.

"We cannot put all our eggs in one basket when it comes to this disease. But there is no doubt that thrombosis does occur, and it can kill. This is an unequivocal point that must be observed," adds Jose Mengel, researcher of the IOC's Clinical Immunology Laboratory and professor at the Medical School of Petropolis.

Considering the many aspects of the physiopathology of the disease that have not been clarified yet, the authors highlight the importance of the joining of forces by professionals who work in the clinical field and in basic research. "The initial response to the SARS-CoV-2 was based mainly on what we knew about other human coronaviruses, which cause respiratory diseases. But we can also use the Zika virus as an analogy: this new virus, of the same family of the dengue virus, surprised everyone when cases of microcephaly began to pop up. This shows we are never ready for a new pathogen, and scientific investigation is crucial to fight these diseases," declares Gonzalo Bello Bentancor, researcher of the IOC's AIDS and Molecular Immunology Laboratory.

[3b] India: B.1.617
Date: Thu 15 Apr 2021, updated Sat 17 Apr 2021 06:45 a.m. IST

https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/double-mutant-now-most-common-of-variantsdata-101618512310963-amp.html?__twitter_impression=true


The so-called double mutation coronavirus found in Maharashtra may be becoming the most prevalent among all mutant variants in India, genome-sequencing data submitted by Indian scientists to a global database indicates, according to a recent analysis that takes into account when they were detected.

The analysis shows for the 1st time how the detection of various variants of the coronavirus may have changed.

The double-mutation virus -- now classified as B.1.617 -- was the most common in the samples sequenced in the 60 days prior to 2 Apr [2021] at 24%. The variant was first detected on 5 Oct [2021] and was relatively obscure till it began popping up on increasing number of samples January [2021] onwards, the India situation report on <outbreak.info> showed. On 1 Apr [2021], it accounted for 80% of all analysed genome sequences of mutant variants sent by India to the global repository GISAID.

The 2nd-most commonly found variant in the last 60 days was the UK variant, or B.1.1.7, at 13% of the samples, according to the assessment by scientists from Scripps Research.

Both trends could be worrying for India, and, at least to some degree, explain the outbreak pattern. B.1.617 was first found in a large number of samples in Maharashtra, the 1st hot spot region of the 2nd wave of infections that, till 7 Apr [2021], added more than half the new cases being recorded in the country.

The researchers at <outbreak.info> added that this data may not reflect the true prevalence patterns. "SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19) sequencing is not a random sample of mutations. As a result, this report does not indicate the true prevalence of the mutations but rather our best estimate now."

The data may also be skewed depending on whether all genomes sequenced were uploaded, although the trends -- where B.1.617 has steadily grown in comparison to other variants among samples -- supports the overall pattern.

But a top official involved in India's coronavirus genome-sequencing efforts said the findings were consistent with what has been observed by them at the ground.

"Nearly 60-80% of the samples from Maharashtra have the variant; the prevalence must be similar in Gujarat. Elsewhere, it is under 10-20%. From barely existing in December [2020], it is now found pretty much everywhere we look. We have a separate column for the variant for every state now," said Anurag Agarwal, director, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, one of the 10 labs under Insacog.

"We have a fairly good idea about which mutated variant is prevalent where; but the important thing is all of them are increasing," he added. "The B.1.617 variant is prevalent towards the West in Maharashtra and Gujarat. The B.1.1.7 variant is prevalent in the North in Punjab. In South India, the one with N440K mutation is prevalent, but that seems to be quiet. Eventually, one of the other variants will reach there. And, in the East, we do not have a particular variant, but the South African variant is fairly common in Bangladesh, causing almost 80% of the cases, so that might cross over to India. That will be troublesome for the AstraZeneca vaccine."

The double mutation refers to specific changes, among some others, that are denoted by E484Q (glutamate is replaced by glutamine at the 484th spot of the spike protein) and L452R (substitution of leucine with arginine at the 452nd position).

Both are being investigated for giving the virus an ability to evade immunity from a past infection, even vaccines. L452R has also been found in a variant spreading in California, US, where it was implicated in a large outbreak earlier this year [2021]. In an interview to HT on Wednesday [14 Apr 2021], India's principal scientific adviser K VijayRaghavan said B.1.617 could now be considered a "variant of concern," or VOC.

The UK variant, B.1.1.7, has been confirmed to be more transmissible and was similarly implicated in a large resurgence of cases across the UK.

A 2nd scientist involved in the sequencing efforts said more evidence is required to tie mutations with case trends. "The double mutant variant is increasing in the country. But the rise in cases cannot be attributed solely to the mutated variants. Human behaviour plays a very important part in transmission; in the UK when the new variant started spreading a lockdown controlled the spread," said Dr Rakesh Mishra, director, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), one of the 10 laboratories in Insacog.

Dr Saumitra Das, director of National Institute of Biomedical Genomics - Kalyani, said: "We have not been able to establish that the new variant is the reason behind the faster spread of the infection during the 2nd wave; it is the behaviour of the people."

The analysis, published on <outbreak.info>, also showed that a large number of B.1.617 samples were detected in West Bengal. The 117 B.1.617 samples in Bengal accounted for 9% of all genomes sequenced in the state till now. In Maharashtra, at 120, there were more samples, but these accounted for 6% of the 1931 samples sequenced.

"To describe the prevalence of sets of mutations in our Mutation Situation Reports, we rely on shared virus sequences from the GISAID Initiative. While we apply filters to remove some low-quality sequences and unreasonable metadata as described in our methods, we rely on the accuracy of the sequences and sample metadata deposited in GISAID," the <outbreak.info> website said.

In all, the B.1.617 variant has been found in 408 sequences sampled across the world. Of these, 265 have been found in India from among the 8455 sequences analysed in the <outbreak.info> report.

[The B.1.617 variant of SARS-CoV-2 carries 2 mutations, E484Q and L452R (found in a California, USA, variant [B.1.427/B.1.429}), and is now classified as B.1.617. Both these mutations are separately found in many other coronavirus variants, but they have been reported together for the 1st time in India.

The 2 mutations are found in the virus's spike protein. The spike protein helps the virus to bind itself to the human cell's receptors and gain entry into a host cell.

The E484Q mutation is similar to E484K, a mutation found in the United Kingdom (lineage B.1.1.7) and South Africa (B.1.351) variants of the coronavirus.

The prevalence of the 'double mutation' variant has increased from 24% of sequenced samples in February [2021] to 80% on 1 Apr [2021]. - Mod.UBA].

The number of COVID-19 deaths in the country has passed the 10 000 mark, with the health directorate reporting 94 new deaths in the past 24 hours till 8:00 a.m. yesterday [15 Apr 2021].

The highest number of deaths -- 96 -- was reported just the day before.

With this, the total number of COVID-19 deaths now stands at 10 081, which is 1.43% of all cases detected in the country since the 1st 3 reported on [8 Mar] last year [2020].

After the coronavirus infection decreased to its lowest in January and February [2021], it started rising from the 2nd week of March [2021] and continued breaking previous records frequently.

On [31 Mar 2021], the total death toll crossed the 9000 mark from the 8000 in 67 days. But it took only 15 days to reach the latest milestone figure, or 10 000.

Experts said the number of deaths seems to proportionately increase 2 weeks after the rise in infection rate.

In late March and early April [2021], the number of detections was on top with frequent new records.

Over the last few days, the number of detections has slightly decreased while the positivity rate has remained stagnant near 20%.

"We are observing a higher number of deaths as the infection rate was higher a week ago. As health safety guidelines are in effect now, the transmission and deaths will hopefully decrease in the coming days. If not, there will be the need of a stricter lockdown," Dr Mushtuq Hussain, consultant of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), told the Daily Star recently.

Meanwhile in the last 24 hours, 4192 new patients tested positive. With this, the total number of confirmed cases rose to 707 362.

Against a total of 19 959 tests in those 24 hours, the positivity rate was 21%, which was 18.29% against 32 955 tests.

The positivity rate is an important parameter to measure the level of virus transmission.

According to the World Health Organization, the transmission will be considered under control if the positivity rate remains stagnant below 5% continuously for at least 2 weeks.

After the 2nd spike in November and December last year [2020], the positivity rate started going down from January [2021]. Throughout February [2021], this rate was below 3%, but it started rising in early March [2021].

In the same 24-hour period, 5915 patients recovered from their illnesses, raising the number of recoveries to 597 214, more than 84% of all cases detected so far.

The COVID-19 2nd wave in India turned grimmer as daily infections crossed the 2-lakh [0.2 million] mark, surging by nearly 9% over the previous day's number to over 2.16 lakh [216 000] on [Thu 15 Apr 2021]. Deaths from the virus in the last 24 hours rose to 1184, the highest since [18 Sep 2020].

Meanwhile, active cases in the country crossed 1.5 million (15 lakh) on [Thu 15 Apr 2021]. The unprecedented flood of infections this month [April 2021] has led to an over 2.5-fold increase in active cases, which numbered less than 6 lakh [0.6 million] on [31 Mar 2021]. A higher active case count means an increased risk of the virus spreading faster as well as a higher probability of deaths.

On [Thu 15 Apr 2021], a record 14 states and UTs posted their highest-ever spike in daily cases while Maharashtra logged its 2nd-biggest surge of 61 695 cases. In all, 216 902 fresh cases were reported on [Thu 15 Apr 2021], as per TOI's database.

As deaths keep increasing -- although still slightly lower than the tolls seen at the peak of the 1st wave -- 4 states reported more than 100 fatalities each in the last 24 hours. Maharashtra continued to record the highest deaths at 349, followed by Chhattisgarh (135), Delhi (112), and Uttar Pradesh (104). Fatalities were also rising in Gujarat, which recorded 81 deaths, Karnataka (66), and Madhya Pradesh (53).

The death rate in Punjab, which recorded 51 fatalities on [Thu 15 Apr 2021], continued to be the highest in the country at 2.7 per 100 cases. The national death rate (or case fatality rate) stood at 1.22% and has been dropping marginally through the 2nd wave as cases spiral sharply.

On [Thu 15 Apr 2021], Uttar Pradesh led the states that saw a record spike in infections with a tally of 22 439. UP is the only state apart from Maharashtra to log more than 20 000 cases in a day. Chhattisgarh reported another new peak of 15 256 fresh cases. Delhi recorded 16 699 new cases, marginally lower than Wednesday's [14 Apr 2021] peak of 17 282.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1618508/record-tests-for-covid-19-conducted-in-a-day

While a record number of COVID-19 tests were conducted in a day since the beginning of the pandemic, the country reported another highest number of coronavirus cases in the last 10 months.

All federating units have issued different schedules for vaccination, bifurcating timings in morning and evening shifts.

Moreover, after confirmation of a number of COVID-19 cases, the Senate Secretariat has been closed for 3 days. It has also been decided to disinfect the Parliament House building.

According to data released by the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC), 64 685 tests were conducted on [Thu 15 Apr 2021], the highest since the beginning of the pandemic in February 2020.

Earlier, the highest number of tests stood at 50 186 carried out on [2 Apr] this year [2021].

The NCOC data showed that as many as 5395 COVID-19 cases -- the highest number since June 2020 -- and 118 deaths were reported during the last 24 hours.

With 509 ventilators for COVID-19 patients occupied across the country, 88% vents were in use in Gujranwala, 82pc in Lahore, 81pc in Multan, and 51pc in Islamabad. Over 90pc oxygenated beds were occupied in Swabi and Charsadda.

The number of coronavirus cases has increased to 739 818 and that of active cases to 77 294. As many as 5106 patients were admitted to hospitals across the country on [Thu 16 Apr 2021].

Moreover, 646 652 persons have so far recovered from the virus across the country, making it a significant count.

All the federating units have shared Ramazan timing for vaccination with the NCOC. According to a document, available with Dawn, vaccination centres in Punjab will remain open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.

In Sindh, all vaccination centers will remain open from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. However, major centers will remain open from 8:30 p.m. to midnight.

In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, timing will be from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and in urban areas vaccination centres will again open from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m.

In Balochistan, vaccination centres will remain open from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. However, in Quetta, the centres will again open from 8 p.m. to midnight.

Timing for Islamabad is from noon to 4 p.m. and from 8 p.m. to midnight. In Azad Jammu and Kashmir, timing will be from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. and from 8 p.m. to midnight. In Gilgit-Baltistan, vaccination centers will remain open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and in major cities the centres will again open from 9 p.m. to midnight.

Meanwhile, due to increasing number of coronavirus cases, the Senate Secretariat has been closed for 3 days, from [16-18 Apr 2021], for disinfection of precincts.

"The Secretariat shall open on [19 Apr 2021] with minimum strength as per rotation policy in place. All staff has been directed to wear face mask, avoid hand shake, and maintain social distance as per SOPs while on duty," said a notification issued on [Thu 15 Apr 2021].

According to another announcement, the building of the Parliament House will be disinfected.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 16 Apr 2021 at 06:09 GMT:

Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 14 291 917 / 174 335 / 125
Pakistan: 745 182 / 15 982 / 71
Bangladesh: 707 362 / 10 081 / 61
Nepal: 282 054 / 3066 / 104
Sri Lanka: 95 949 / 608 / 28
Afghanistan: 57 612 / 2535 / 64
Maldives: 25 939 / 67 / 122
Bhutan: 934 / 1 / 1

Over the last 7 days, 1 231 375, 41 230, and 34 353 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, respectively, compared with 757 411, 48 368, and 32 664 cases in the preceding 7 days, revealing the continuation of the sharp-uptrend of the disease in India, but a statistic trend in the other 2 countries. However, 2 other vital parameters -- daily case-positivity and number of daily deaths -- are both increasing in Bangladesh. As such, the case-positivity was around 21% yesterday (15 Apr 2021) in the country. A total of 96 people died due to COVID-19 day before yesterday (14 Apr 2021), the highest ever for a single day count since the 1st death caused by the disease reported on 18 Mar 2020. The number of total deaths of the country attributed to the disease has also crossed the epidemiological landmark of 10 000.

The number of COVID-19 new cases detected in India yesterday (15 Apr 2021) was 0.216 million, as indicated in item [2] above. This is already more than 2 times higher from the highest peak recorded during the 1st wave of the disease. It is difficult to predict when
this exponential surge of new cases in the country would eventually reach the peak in spite of the vaccination rollout across the country.

By 15 Apr 2021, at least 111 179 578 people have reportedly been vaccinated in the country (https://indianexpress.com/article/india/coronavirus-india-live-updates-covid-19-second-wave-kumbh-mela-maharashtra-lockdown-vaccine-sputnik-v-7271165/).

Over the last 7 days, 2954 and 1696 cases were reported in Nepal and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared with 1639 and 591 cases in the previous 7 days, indicating almost a 2-fold increase in Nepal but a 3-fold in Sri Lanka over a period of just 7 days. Only time would say whether or not this trend is an indication of the beginning of a new wave of the disease in these 2 countries as well, as already observed in 3 other South Asian countries, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.
