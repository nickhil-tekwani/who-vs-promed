Pheasants were said to be the one kind of bird that is cannibalistic, and
acquire EEE virus in this manner from others in the flock. Poultry and
other kinds of birds also share this habit of pecking at others in their
flock, and they often concentrate their attacks on a wound. Epiornitics of
EEE occur with some frequency amongst flocks of ratites (emus, ostriches,
and rheas). These birds are exquisitely susceptible to EEE infection, and
secondary cases result from oral exposure to massive quantities of virus,
most likely in blood-laden diarrhea expelled by dying birds.

Several kinds of mosquitoes may, indeed, develop in pools and puddles of
water (often fouled with animal wastes and hay infusions) within and around
barns. These sites are preferred habitats of certain _Culex_ mosquitoes.
Water-containing buckets and troughs, clean and otherwise, can also be
exploited by these and several kinds of _Aedes_ mosquitoes. Adult females
of these mosquitoes may find blood meals close at hand, from the sometimes
abundant birds nesting and roosting near or inside the barn, from the
domesticated fowl and mammals caged or stabled within, and even from their
human keepers. Although the _Culex_ and _Aedes_ that may perpetuate within
a barn would generally seem unimportant to the maintenance of EEE virus in
nature, they could potentially serve as occasional bridge vectors,
transmitting virus from wild birds to domesticated ones, and also to mammals.

[While it is true that other birds are cannibalistic as described above,
pheasants are the only ones I was aware of transmitting EEE in this oral
manner. Clearly, Dr Pollack has a more detailed knowledge of mosquitoes. In
many barns that I have been in, the horse owners (not to be confused with
barns of swine or fowl or perhaps even bovines), clean and dump water on a
daily basis under the belief that this prevents mosquitoes and provides a
cleaner environment for their animals.

I appreciate Dr. Pollack's kind and educational remarks. - Mod.TG]
