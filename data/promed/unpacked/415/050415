Just over $189 million has been spent by the government to contain
the malaria outbreak. This figure was revealed by Information
Minister Donald Buchanan at Monday's post Cabinet press briefing.
Help also came from the National Health Fund which accounted for 8
million dollars and USAID which donated US $200 000.
The United Nations Children's Fund and the United Nations Population
Fund also gave assistance. And technical support came from the Cuban
government, which provided 4 experts as well as staff to read slides.
Mr. Buchanan said on Monday Health Minister Horace Dalley presented a
report to Cabinet on the malaria control and eradication efforts
which showed that only one new case had been confirmed in the first
week of the New Year. He asserted Jamaicans can now breathe a sigh of
relief as indications are that the country will retain its malaria-free status.
The Minister reported that the malaria outbreak peaked at a high of
43 cases in December 2006.

More than 200 malaria cases now confirmed
-----------------
Two hundred and nine cases of malaria have now been confirmed by the
Ministry of Health as it continues efforts to contain the outbreak of
the disease.
However the rate of new cases is now down to one to 2 per day in
areas in downtown Kingston, particularly Rema and Greenwich Town.
Speaking on Beyond the Headlines on Tuesday, Acting Chief Medical
Officer, Dr. Shelia Campbell-Forester said no new cases have been
discovered in the other areas initially affected by the disease.
She appealed once more for the co-operation of residents to
ensure that the country gets back to zero status for malaria.
Dr. Campbell Forester warned that several steps will have to be
taken before Jamaica can once again be declared malaria free and
urged all stakeholders not to relax too soon.
The government has so far spent just over $189 million in its
fight to control the malaria outbreak.

[The report shows that during the acute phase many patients with
fever are wrongly diagnosed with malaria entirely based on clinical
signs and symptoms. Even the lower figure of 43 confirmed cases is
quite serious and the report of the cost of containing the outbreak
is astonishing. From the second report, it appears as though cases
are still continuing to occur. Information from knowledgeable
sources on the epidemiology of this outbreak would be very much
appreciated. - Mods.EP/MPP]
