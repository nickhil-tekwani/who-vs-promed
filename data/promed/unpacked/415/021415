Two residents of eastern Nevada County are confirmed to have contracted [a]
hantavirus [infection], a sometimes-deadly disease [virus] passed to humans
by rodents. The 2 residents have since recovered, a Nevada County
Environmental Health Department news release states.

Since the virus was identified in 1993, 48 cases have been reported in
California and 465 cases [throughout the United States]. About 40 per cent
of the state's cases have been fatal, the environmental health department
states.

State and county officials are investigating how the 2 most recent
flare-ups [cases] occurred. Hantavirus[es] are contracted through contact
with urine, droppings or saliva of wild mice, primarily deer mice
[_Peromyscus maniculatus_].

The illness begins with fever, headache, and muscle ache. Those symptoms
progress rapidly to severe breathing difficulty.

The department provides precautionary tips
- avoid areas where wild rodents are likely to be present;
- spray diluted bleach on areas contaminated with rodent droppings and
urine. Wear plastic gloves and use a wet sponge or mop to clean
contaminated area;
- do not touch live rodents and wear gloves when handling dead ones.

[Hantaviruses are a large group of bunyaviruses found around the world.
They have rodent reservoir hosts. Although not specified, the hantavirus
involved in these 2 California cases was probably Sin Nombre virus.
