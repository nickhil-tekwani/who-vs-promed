FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE IN LIBYA
The last outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Libya reported to the OIE
occurred in 1994. This emergency report is based on information received on
18 June 2003 from Dr Giuma Hallul, director of the Animal Health
Department, General Popular Committee of Animal Resources, Tripoli.
The report, dated 18 June 2003, refers to an animal health incident first
detected on 7 May 2003, diagnosed clinically and in the laboratory. The
estimated date of first infection was 1 May 2003. Two outbreaks are
reported -- one in the Province of Sabratah (in the north-western part of
the country) and one in Province of Az Zawiyah (in the north-western part
of the country).
Total number of animals in the outbreaks:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
bov / 6 / 5/ 0 / 0 / 0
Diagnosis:
Infection with the causal agent (FMD virus serotype SAT 2) was diagnosed at
the Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright Laboratory, United Kingdom (OIE
Reference Laboratory for foot and mouth disease [FMD]), using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and virus neutralisation test performed with
primary bovine thyroid cells (BTY) and pig kidney cell line (IB-RS-2) cells.
Epidemiology:
This is the first time the strain involved (SAT 2) has been recorded in Libya.
Control measures:
- quarantine;
- movement control inside the country;
- screening.
Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department:
This is the first time the FMD virus strain SAT 2 has been recorded in
North Africa.

[This is very alarming news; to the best of our knowledge, FMD serotype
SAT2 has not been diagnosed in any Mediterranean country since 1950. It
occurred relatively recently in the Middle East, however, in Yemen (1990),
in Saudi Arabia (April 2000, dairy cattle), and in Kuwait (June 2000,
reportedly in sheep on the Saudi border). The annual OIE report for 2000
remarked that these were the first reports of the serotype SAT2 outside
Africa. See also table "FMD in the Middle East, 1960-2000", at
<http://www.israel-embassy.org.uk/web/pages/table1.htm>.
Libya is of course some distance from these countries. SAT2 has been
reported, in recent years, in large areas of Eastern and Southern
sub-Saharan Africa. In 2002 SAT2 has been reported in Southern Africa
(Botswana and Zimbabwe) and East Africa (Kenya and Uganda) according the
Pirbright's OIE/FAO FMD reference center website. There were no reports of
SAT2 anywhere in the world in 2001 and Saudi Arabia reported SAT2 in 2000.
1999 included reports of SAT2 from 4 East African countries. For details
see
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/virus/Picornaviridae/Aphthovirus/index.html>,
where a map showing the countries in which FMD was reported between 1990
and 2002 can be seen as well.
This is a serious situation for two reasons. Firstly, the disease is new to
the area and regional vaccination strategies are not likely to include the
SAT2 serotype, thus animals will likely not be protected. We recognize the
possibility that a different strain from the vaccine strain may circulate
anywhere that FMD occurs, but in Libya, this is no longer just a
possibility. In all probability, the animals in the country are not
protected. Very rigorous disease and movement controls will be needed to
keep ahead of this fast moving disease. Secondly, an epidemiological adage
says that war and other disruptions in the social fabric often spawn
epidemics. What relationship this outbreak may have to recent disruptions
in the Middle East is unknown but control of animal movements throughout
this region is particularly important after news of this outbreak. - Mods
