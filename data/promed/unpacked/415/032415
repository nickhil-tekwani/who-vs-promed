MALARIA CHEMOPROPYLAXIS IN G-6PD DEFICIENCY: RFI
================================================
A question as arisen that I am at a loss to find the answer to.
Any help would be appreciated. When someone is glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficent, I was taught that this greatly
affects the manner of chemoprophylaxis in malaria-endemic zones.
(Of course the area(s) also play a role.) But a physician at a
meeting I attended stated that when someone is G-6-PD deficient,
the course would be Doxycycline ONLY, and that this is based on
the level of G-6-PD deficiency.
My education as a military preventive medicine tech was that
G-6-PD deficiency affects post exposure chemoprophylaxis.
One can (if it is the choice) give chloroquine, BUT under
no circumstances would one give Primaquine. Education,
prevention by use of DEET, and monitoring of the patient post travel
are also advised, of course.
Has this changed? is there a new protocol?
Any information would be helpful.
