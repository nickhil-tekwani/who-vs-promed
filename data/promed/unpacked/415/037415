China's Health Ministry said here Thursday that tuberculosis retained the
highest incidence rate in May [2004] on the Chinese mainland among all
reported infectious diseases, and rabies remained the top killer. The
ministry said rabies had the highest death rate among the communicable
diseases on the Chinese mainland, followed by AIDS, infant tetanus and
epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis.
[If human rabies runs to more than 1000 cases a year, this means more than
100 cases per month. Rabies can easily be the leading cause of death by
infection. The rabies situation in China is much worse than I could have
imagined. See below from PubMed. - Mod.LJS]

2002 and its preventive measures in China] [Article in Chinese]

Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and
Prevention, Beijing 102206, China.
Objective: To summarize and analyze the epidemic situation of human rabies
from 1984 to 2002 in China, and to explore the possible factors causing the
increase of cases so as to provide evidence for preventive and control
measures.
Method: National and some provincial data on the prevalence of rabies
during 1984 to 2002 were collected and analyzed.
Results: From 1984 to 1989, the annual reported cases were between 4000 and
6000 but decreased after 1990. In 1996, the reported cases decreased to the
lowest level from 3520 in 1990 to 159. However, number of reported cases
has been continuously increasing since 1998, reaching 1122 in 2002, a
7.06-fold increase as compared to the number in 1996. The epidemic areas
were mainly located in the southeast and southwest parts of the country,
such as Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Anhui, Fujian, etc.
Furthermore, there was not the significant seasonal distribution it showed
before.
Conclusion: Such facts as the increasing numbers of dogs, low inoculation
rate of dogs, poor control on the quality of rabies vaccine,
mistreatment of wounds, and lack of cooperation between different official
departments regarding rabies control might serve as important factors
responsible for the recurrence of rabies. Therefore, it is necessary to
focus on the above-mentioned points and to take comprehensive preventive
measures to bring down the prevalence of rabies in China.
Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi [journal name] 2001
Feb;22(1):8-10. [Analysis on the present situation of human rabies
epidemic in China] [Article in Chinese]
Tang Q, Zhao X, Tao X. Epidemiology and Microbiology Institute, National
Academy of Preventive Medicine, Beijing 102206, China.
Objective: To summarize and analyze human rabies epidemic situation in the
last 5 years in China and to explore the possible factors causing the
rising of epidemics to provide reference for the prevention and control of
rabies in the future.
Methods: Collecting and analyzing data of rabies epidemics in the last 5
years in whole nation.
Results: Numbers of human rabies cases are continuing to rise over the last
5 years in China, with an increase of 44.65 percent, 1.74 percent, and
45.93 percent in 1997, 1998, 1999. Human rabies incidence was also seen an
increase from 0.0134 per 100 000 in 1996 to 0.02708 per 100 000 in 1999.
The provinces showing increases in rabies were mainly located in south China.
Among them, Jiangsu province reported 40 human cases in 1999, which
increased 207.69 percent over the corresponding period in 1998. The cases
in these high epidemic provinces accounted for 75 percent of the whole
nation's cases. The number of reported rabies case is also rising.
Conclusion: Facts such as the increasing number of dogs being bred, lack of
rabies vaccination, failure to administer antirabies serum timely or for
the full course after exposure, lack of strict quality controls on rabies
vaccine, as well as the lack of cooperation between official departments
regarding rabies control might be some of the factors responsible for the
continuing increase in cases of human rabies.

[The authors attribute the recurrence and sharp rise in human rabies to 5
main factors: the increasing numbers of dogs, low inoculation rate of dogs,
poor control on the quality of (animal?) rabies vaccine, incorrect
treatment of the wounds, and lack of cooperation between different official
departments regarding rabies control.
Poor quality of animal vaccines has been repeatedly mentioned by
ProMED-mail in relation to animal diseases in China, with special recent
reference to avian influenza. One cannot stress enough the critical need
for efficient state control on vaccine production, licensing, and
certification. Full implementation of internationally prescribed
requirements is urgently needed in order to safeguard safe and efficacious
vaccines and protect animal and human life. - Mod.AS]
[The newswire report above is a summary from the most recently monthly
report issued by the China Ministry of Health on morbidity and mortality
due to infectious diseases in China. In the report available on the China
MOH website (<http://www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/gzdt/1200406110002.htm>), there is
a table that lists the number of cases and number of deaths by disease
entity during the month of May 2004
(<http://www.moh.gov.cn/zhgl/gzdt/1200406110002_1_0.doc>). In this report,
there is mention that "rabies, pulmonary tuberculosis, AIDS, hemorrhagic
fever, (and a 5th disease not easily translated by machine translation)
accounted for 80.7 percent of deaths due to infectious diseases during the
month of May. In contrast, pulmonary tuberculosis, hepatitis B, amoebic
dysentery, gonorrhea, and measles, account for 84.8 percent of reported
cases of infectious diseases during the month of May. Case fatality rates
for rabies, AIDS, neonatal tetanus, and 2 other diseases (that did not
easily translate through machine translation) are the highest observed
during this month. - Mod.MPP]
