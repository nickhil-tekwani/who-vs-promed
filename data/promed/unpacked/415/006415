Avian influenza in Cote d'Ivoire
--------------------------------
Disease never reported before in Cote d'Ivoire
Translation of information received on 25 Apr 2006 from Dr Denis Kouakou,
director of veterinary services and quality, Ministry of Animal Production
and Fish Resources, Abidjan.
Identification of agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1.
Date of start of the event: 30 Mar 2006.
Two outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been reported in
Abidjan district (Marcory Anoumabo and Treichville communes), in Lagunes
region. The animals affected are traditional backyard free-ranging chickens
(7 cases) and ducks (9 cases) and one sparrowhawk. [The sparrowhawk
_Accipiter nisus_ is a small bird of prey.- Mod.PC]
The diagnosis has been established by the Central Veterinary Laboratory of
the LANADA (National Laboratory for Agricultural Development Support) at
Bingerville and by Pasteur Institut of Cote d'Ivoire. The confirmation of
the OIE reference laboratory in Padua (Italy) is expected.
In addition to other measures, there has been an implementation of an
infected zone around the outbreak in Marcory Anoumabo and a surveillance
zone in the district of Abidjan.

[Again, we see, as in Asia, a similar scenario of spread once the disease
has been introduced. In Nigeria, the disease has spread around large areas
of the country. One wonders in this case, starting out around the capital,
Abidjan, whether it can be contained or not. It should be noted that, in
any case, we have continued spread of the disease throughout West Africa as
the epidemic progresses. The goal is to stop it from becoming endemic in
West Africa, but so far, there is no obvious way to do that. This means we
have H5N1 avian influenza reported from Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon, Burkina
Faso, and now Cote d'Ivoire. Can Ghana be safe for long? This would be a
good place to try any new strategies that animal health officials are
contemplating. See map at:
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/westafrica.pdf> and
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagunes>.
An interesting aspect of this report is the infection in a sparrowhawk.
Birds of prey have been reported several times for H5N1, including very
recently in Germany, and there was a report of H5N2 in a hawk in Kuwait
last year (2005). One would only suspect they get infected by attacking
sick birds, but it would be useful to know under what conditions such
attacks happen in order to fill out the epidemiologic picture. - Mod.PC]
