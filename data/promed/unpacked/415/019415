Croatian authorities said that a new outbreak of classical swine
fever [CSF] has hit the eastern part of the country, 3 months after
thousands of pigs were slaughtered there to halt an epidemic.
"Classical swine fever was confirmed at a farm with 94 pigs. In order
to prevent the spread of the disease, all the pigs were euthanized,"
said an agriculture ministry statement. It added that necessary
bio-security measures were introduced in the area in order to halt
the spread of the disease.
The eastern part of the country was affected by an outbreak of swine
fever last July [2006], which turned into an epidemic that was
brought under control by veterinary authorities. In the action, some
11 000 pigs were slaughtered, causing losses of EUR 1.1 million (USD
1.43 million).
Swine fever is a highly contagious disease, which is passed on
through excrement or saliva. It does not affect other animal species or humans.

[The OIE data is in a state of upgrading so WAHID (World Animal
Health Information Database - OIE) maps don't quite match their
statistics. One misses the old Handistatis (OIE database interface
accessible on the Web) data. However, since July 2006 until Thu 18
Jan 2007, Croatia has reported 15 outbreaks of CSF throughout the
country with a loose cluster in the western half and a tight cluster
of many outbreaks close to its farther eastern border; Bulgaria had 3
outbreaks in 2006; Germany had 8 outbreaks in 2006; Hungary has had 5
outbreaks already this year [2007]; and outbreaks are shown in
Slovenia and Slovakia but details are lacking... The common thread is
infected wild boars. This is patently an area awaiting genomic
analysis as well as an investigation of why outbreaks are recurring,
given that this is a readily controllable disease.
