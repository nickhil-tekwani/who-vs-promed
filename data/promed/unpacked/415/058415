More information on transmission potential of malaria in Italy
--------------------------------------------------------------
For readers who wish to get more information:

1. The 1997 case
(<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9643745?dopt=Abstract>) was
interpreted by the authors of the investigation (Lancet 1998; 351(9111):
1246-7) as "These investigations suggest that the index case of malaria was
caused by local anopheline mosquitoes infected with exogenous _Plasmodium
vivax_," -- that is, local mosquito -- exogenous plasmodium.

2. CDC points to an interesting perspective paper updated in 2001: "Could
malaria reappear in Italy?" <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol7no6/romi.htm#1>.

[ProMED-mail thanks Professor Beniamino Cenci Goga for the information. The
2001 paper in Emerging Infectious Diseases concludes that "The overall
malariogenic potential of Italy appears to be low, and reintroduction of
malaria is unlikely in most of the country."

We believe this is still the situation, and hope that we will soon receive
confirmation that the patient referred to in the 1st posting was not
infected in Fondi. ­ Mod.EP]
