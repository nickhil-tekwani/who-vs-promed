Kiwifruit disease shows resistance to key treatment
---------------------------------------------------
The Kiwifruit Vine Health (KVH) program has shown [strain] Psa-V resistance to streptomycin in 2 Te Puke [Western Bay of Plenty region of New Zealand] orchards. The detections were made in the most recent tests of an ongoing copper and streptomycin resistance monitoring program, which has been in place since 2011 to ensure resistance is detected early.

KVH said these finds were 'not completely unexpected'. The streptomycin-resistant Psa-V was still susceptible to copper. "Resistance to streptomycin can occur even where [it] has not been used," they said. There was no evidence [that] the resistance [was] due to inappropriate use of streptomycin.

KVH and [kiwifruit] marketer Zespri are working to understand the implications. Other orchards in New Zealand could also have streptomycin resistance. "Zespri and KVH are continuing to test and identify alternative and sustainable control approaches for Psa-V. Both orchards have been working with KVH to ensure best practice resistance management. This includes the application of copper spray, movement restrictions on plant material, and a strong focus on orchard hygiene."

Intensive sampling and testing of the 2 orchards and the surrounding orchards is underway. Further testing is also being carried out to establish the nature of resistance. Streptomycin has been registered for use against Psa-V in New Zealand since 2011.

[Bacterial canker of kiwifruit (_Actinidia_ species and hybrids) caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ (Psa) was originally described in Japan in 1989, but its area of origin is uncertain. Symptoms include discolouration of buds and vascular tissues, leaf spots, wilting, stem and twig cankers with characteristic red exudate, fruit collapse, and eventually death of the plant. The disease is favoured by cool temperatures and high humidity, thus symptoms are usually seen in spring and autumn.

Data on epidemiology are still lacking, but infection is thought to occur via natural leaf openings and wounds. The pathogen is suspected to be spread by heavy rain, strong winds, mechanical means (including animal and human activities), and infected plant material. Spread with pollen is strongly suspected. Research in NZ found live Psa bacteria associated with pollen from closed kiwifruit flowers, which was previously considered pathogen free for quarantine purposes. Spread with infected fruit cannot be excluded until conclusive data become available.

Disease management of Psa (and other bacterial diseases) may include cultural practices, crop rotation, phytosanitation to prevent spread, use of clean planting and propagating material (including pollen), and resistant crop varieties. Chemical control (copper compounds, antibiotics) is used to control Psa in Italy and Japan, but resistant pathogen strains have emerged. Use of antibiotics in agriculture is mostly subject to strict regulations and the emergence of a new streptomycin resistant strain in New Zealand is unfortunate for the national kiwifruit industry.

An outbreak of Psa in Italy in 2010 (ProMED-mail post 20100414.1207) affecting 25 percent of the Zespri Gold variety vines was found to be due to the emergence of a new, very virulent strain, Psa-V. A less aggressive strain of Psa has been reported from Australia (ProMED-mail post 20110722.2206). Details of strains present in France, Spain, Switzerland, Portugal, and China are not yet available. In Chile, Psa was first reported in 2011 (ProMED-mail post 20110325.0940), but the strain(s) have also not been identified yet.

In New Zealand, 2 separate pathogen strains have been identified including the virulent Psa-V. According to recent research, Psa strains from China and New Zealand appear to be more similar to each other than to strains from Italy suggesting that the source of the NZ outbreak remains to be clarified.
