A Louisiana man died after contracting a "flesh-eating" bacterium while fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. The Town Talk reports the bacterium known as _Vibrio vulnificus_, which is found in warm seawater, killed the 83-year-old man after his open wound got infected when water splashed on him during a fishing trip.

"It thrives in warm water," Dr. Tina Stefanski of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals told KATC-TV. "So, you can imagine in the summer months, we see an increased number of this type of bacteria in warm salt water." The department is warning swimmers and beach-goers to be careful in the warm water, especially ones with open wounds.

"We certainly do not mean to discourage people from enjoying water activities, but we want them to understand the potential risks involved," Department Secretary Kathy Kliebert told The Town Talk. "DHH works with other state and local partners to monitor and test beach water to inform residents of the water quality, and we hope residents will heed posted beach advisories when they see them."

Three others swimming in the Louisiana Gulf coast were sickened from the bacterium.

[The following is exacted from the "Bad Bug Book," Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food & Drug Administration) at http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap10.html:

_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.

The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html).

There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LL
