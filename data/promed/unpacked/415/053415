We [have had several replies about the cause of this unexplained
encephalopathy. Most felt Reyes Syndrome was the most likely etiology.
Interesting.
We will be alert for other cases and remember to caution parents about the
use of aspirin injudiciously, particularly in concert with viral diseases
such as varicella.
Good to have feedback on ProMED-mail; not quite as definitive as
post-mortem studies but very helpful nevertheless!
