"The provincial SA Police Service and the Road Traffic Inspectorate
have been made aware and are on stand-by to be activated urgently as
and when the need arises to assist with the setting-up of roadblocks
to control the movement of live animals," said Agriculture Minister
Tina Joemat-Pettersson and KwaZulu-Natal agriculture MEC Lydia Johnson
in a joint statement on Thursday [3 Mar 2011].

The 2 were in Jozini in northern KwaZulu-Natal visiting farmers who
were affected by FMD.

On Monday [28 Mar 2011], Joemat-Pettersson announced that there was a
suspected outbreak of FMD in northern KwaZulu-Natal.

FMD is a severe, highly contagious viral disease which affects
livestock, cattle and swine as well as sheep, goats, and other
cloven-hoofed animals. The disease does not affect human beings.

The agriculture department said some cattle in 23 dip tanks had
tested positive for the disease.

"If a test is positive, it confirms active infection of the FMD virus
even though the specific strain has not been identified. What this
means essentially is that we have an outbreak of FMD."

Surveillance had been intensified with a view to determining the
furthest point of infection.

"Surveillance will be conducted in areas north of the Umfolosi River.
Additional surveillance will be conducted in the South of
KwaZulu-Natal and in provinces adjacent to KwaZulu-Natal the Free
State, Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga."

The department will also be liaising with neighbouring countries,
Swaziland and Mozambique, to ensure control measures.

Over 600 animals have been tested, and 50 percent of them were found
to be positive.

"Government wishes to convey the message that the situation is under
control and that there is no need to panic. Farmers are cautioned to
observe bio-security measures, not to allow any new animals into their
herd, and to minimise the movement of their own herd as well as animal
products to other farms."

All suspected cases of the disease in animals must be reported to the
local state veterinarian.

[According to an immediate notification of the south African
Veterinary Services, submitted to the OIE on 25 Feb 2011, a total of
12 outbreaks have been reported. The given start date of the event was
1 Feb 2011. The total number of susceptible cattle was 473, of which
there were 224 cases. The report included the following
epidemiological comments:

"The affected area is partially situated in the FMD Free Zone of
South Africa, and all exports of cloven hoofed animals and animal
products will be suspended with immediate effect, except for products
that have been fully processed to inactivate FMD virus. No clinical
signs of disease were observed, therefore, sero-positive results were
counted as cases of infection. The number of animals sampled was used
as the number of susceptible animals. Vaccination by State Veterinary
Services will be allowed only in the affected areas of KwaZulu Natal.
The epidemiological units (village = diptank) in the Northern part of
KwaZulu Natal are dip tanks used for FMD inspection. Liquid-phase
blocking ELISA and non-structural protein (NSP) ELISA tests are done
on all samples. All the NSP ELISA tests were negative."

The notification, including an interactive map, is available at
