Background data on _Leishmania donovani_ in Spain
-----------------------------------------
The disease is most common in the southern region. Seroprevalence among
dogs in this region is lowest during April, peaking during October.
Approximately 100 cases [in dogs were reported annually prior to 1987. 98
cases were reported in 1987. A single autochthonous case has been reported
from Minorca. 60 deaths were ascribed to leishmaniasis during 1980 to 1994.
5.25% of dogs in the Madrid area are seropositive.
450 AIDS/Leishmania coinfections [human infections were reported
nationwide during 1990 to 1995 (52.4% of the world's total coinfections);
412 during 1996 to 1998.
2.49% of AIDS patients in the Madrid region are coinfected with visceral
leishmaniasis. Transmission through sharing of needles by intravenous drug
addicts has been reported.
The vectors in Spain are _Phlebotomus [Larroussius ariasi_ and _P.
perniciosus_.

Another comment on asymptomatic leishmaniasis:

From: Ellicott McConnell <eck@shore.intercom.net>

Asymptomatic infections with visceral leishmaniasis may be the rule rather
than the exception. While working in an endemic area in the Sudan we found
a constant high _L. donovani_ infection rate in sandflies collected in the
vicinity of local villages. Of the expatriots involved in collecting, three
contracted leishmaniasis, but with only slight dermal manifestations (one
person after only one night's exposure). It seems possible that the
villagers are repeatedly, if not chronically, infected, but suffer clinical
visceral leishmaniasis only when stressed by famine or other factors.

[The data on human cases in Spain clearly shows that leishmaniasis is a
problem which need to be considered in all febrile patients with
unexplained fever of a longer duration who has visited Spain. Leishmania is
a zoonotic infection with reservoir in dogs, and knowledge of the
epidemiology in the dog population will give us an indication and warning
of risks to the human population. The fact that leishmaniasis surfaces as a
problem in HIV/AIDS patients also shows that asymptomatic infection is
common in persons with an adequate immune system, which is emphasized by
the second report. - Mod.EP
