Annual report of the Australian Gonococcal Surveillance Programme, 1997 -
The Australian Gonococcal Surveillance Programme. Commun Dis Intell
1998;22:212-216.
Abstract: The Australian Gonococcal Surveillance Programme (AGSP) examined
2,817 isolates of _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ in the period 1 January to 31
December 1997, a number similar to that reported in 1996. The biggest
change in incidence of gonococcal disease occurred in New South Wales and
Queensland where a 20% rise in the number of isolates was noted. In the
latter case this was due to improved surveillance, but in the former
represented a real increase. The sites of infection and antibiotic
susceptibility patterns varied considerably between regions reflecting
considerable differences between rural and urban gonorrhoea in Australia.
Strains examined in South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria were
predominantly from male patients and rectal and pharyngeal isolates were
common. In other centres the male to female ratio was lower and most
isolates were from the genital tract. Resistance to the penicillin and
quinolone groups of antibiotics were also highest in urban centres, but
penicillins remained suitable for use in many parts of rural Australia.
Quinolone resistance in gonococci continued to increase. This was
particularly so in Sydney where quinolone resistant _N. gonorrhoeae_ (QRNG)
accounted for about 15% of all isolates and spread of QRNG was
predominantly by local contact. QRNG in other centres continued to be
isolated at a lower frequency, mostly from overseas travellers. All
isolates remained sensitive to spectinomycin and ceftriaxone.
