Three persons have tested positive for Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, in the district since Thursday [16 Apr 2020].

On Thursday [16 Apr 2020], a 44-year-old woman from Muppane village in the Sharavathi backwater region in Sagar taluk tested positive for KFD. She was suffering from high fever and pain in joints since 12 Apr [2020]. She has been hospitalised and is being closely monitored. Another woman from Thorebailu village in Tirthahalli taluk who was suffering from fatigue and high fever was diagnosed for KFD on Thursday [16 Apr 2020].

The blood samples of a 45-year-old woman from Konandur in Tirthahalli taluk tested positive on Friday [17 Apr 2020]. As the woman had health complications including diabetes, she was admitted to a private multi-specialty hospital in Shivamogga city.

With this, the total number of positive cases in the district since 1 Jan [2020] reached 156, including 124 cases from Tirthahalli taluk and 32 cases from Sagar taluk. Of the total 156 positive cases, 13 persons have been admitted to various hospitals at present.

Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) -- or monkey fever -- has spread across 12 districts with 200 cases reported across Karnataka. This year [2020], 16 children below 14 years have been affected, compared with 2 cases last year [2019]. On Sunday [12 Apr 2020], 5 cases were detected in Kolarka village of Siddapura taluk [subdivision], taking the number of cases to 41 in Uttar Kannada [district in Karnataka state]. If Chikkamagaluru has seen 10 cases, Shivamogga [district in the state] is the worst-affected district with 146 cases of KFD. Last year [2019], Karnataka had reported 400 cases of monkey fever.

Health officials say the number of cases has increased due to the lockdown, as many people who have come down to Shivamogga and other Malnad districts are venturing into forests, thereby contracting the viral hemorrhagic fever disease that is at its peak during April.

Akhilesh Chipli, a naturalist from Sagar, said, "With Shivamogga district reporting no COVID-19 cases, many people come from Bengaluru and Mysuru to spend the lockdown time by going into forest areas on their private vehicles, right from Sakrebailu to Agumbe. The lockdown has proved to be very difficult for forest officials, as they are not only tackling forest fires and encroachments but also rising incidents of wildlife poaching. So it has been easy for people to evade the forest staff and enter forests."

Further, viral transmission to humans has also been from cattle when they are left in the forests for grazing by farmers.

Wildlife veterinarian Dr. H.S. Prayag says, "Cattle carry infected ticks when they are left in forest for grazing, and that is the link, not that cattle transmit the virus directly. Animals like monkeys that are dead or infected have been transmitting the virus to man through ticks, the intermediate host."

There is already a red alert sounded by health authorities in the affected taluks of Tirthahalli and Sagar. Further, entry to forests for collection of forest produce and cattle grazing has been banned. Forest officials are carrying out measures to destroy tick pools on the forest floor, as the virus is transmitted from monkeys to humans through the bite of infected ticks.

According to the National Centre for Disease Control [NCDC], directorate general of Health Services, KFD is a re-emerging zoonotic disease. The Karnataka government has been regularly declaring "potential exposure zones" for any monkey deaths occurring in a radius of 5 km (3.1 mi). However, experts say that unless there is a holistic, coordinated approach by involving all the stakeholders -- health, veterinary, forest, and other departments -- the zoonotic disease cannot be wished away in the Malnad region.

[The report above mentions that approximately 200 cases have been reported across Karnataka state, with a higher number of children effected in 2020 [16 cases; 8%] as compared to only 2 cases in 2019. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread present new challenges for public health officials to respond to existing infectious disease outbreaks and poses a risk of increased incidence and/or under-reporting of other diseases. - Mod.UBA
