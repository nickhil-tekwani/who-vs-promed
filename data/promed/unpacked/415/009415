A horse at Fair Grounds [racing club] returned a positive test [Tue 3 Jan 2017] for the so-called "wild" strain of the equine herpesvirus, or EHV-1.

That marks the 5th EHV-1 positive at Fair Grounds since a horse housed in barn 14 who had been euthanized after becoming neurologic [having neurologic signs] tested positive for the virus [26 Dec 2016]. Another horse in barn 14 tested positive [31 Dec 2016] after getting sick. Both of the horses in barn 14 were positive for the neuropathogenic strain of EHV-1, which far more often results in neurologic signs, severe illness, and fatalities than the milder wild-type strain.

A horse in barn 36 tested positive for the wild-type EHV-1 sub-strain on [1 Jan 2017], and though the wild-type strain doesn't usually produce neurologic signs, this horse, trained by [MS], had them. He's in an isolation area on the backstretch, and his condition has continued to improve since [31 Dec 2016].

A horse housed in the receiving barn tested positive [Mon 2 Jan 2017] for the wild-type sub-strain of EHV-1. This horse, trained by [CD], never displayed signs besides a fever. [Fever is often the earliest sign of this disease and it is why it is recommended to take the temperature of the horse at least twice a day. - Mod.TG]

A news release issued by Fair Grounds on Tuesday night [3 Jan 2017] did not describe the signs of the horse producing the latest positive test, and its trainer, did not immediately respond to a text message. The release said the horse was positive for the wild-type, non-neurogenic EHV-1 strain and had been permitted by the Louisiana Department of Agriculture to leave Fair Grounds for an approved isolation site at a "private farm."

Most of [the trainer's] Fair Grounds string occupies barn 46. The horse was housed in barn 47, which thus, like barns 14, 36, and the receiving barn, has begun a 14-day quarantine period. Horses stabled in that barn won't be allowed to race and will train after the main body of the equine population exercises. Barn 47, barn 36, and horses stabled in the receiving barn all have the same training window because of positive tests for the same sub-strain. The barn 14 horses train during a different period.

The barn 14 quarantine would end [13 Jan 2017] if no other horses there test positive for EHV-1. The barn 37 quarantine extends through 14 Jan 2017 and the receiving barn quarantine through [16 Jan 2017], barring further positives. Barn 47 will be quarantined now at least until 17 Jan 2017, just 4 days before Fair Grounds hosts its Road to the Derby Kickoff card, including the Grade 3 Lecomte Stakes for 3-year-olds.

The Department of Agriculture and Fair Grounds placed the entire backstretch under quarantine [Mon 2 Jan 2017] following the positive test in the receiving barn, which mainly holds ship-ins who come to the track to race.

Delta Downs [race track] in Vinton [Louisiana], has postponed and rescheduled 2 USD 100 000 stakes races, the Azalea on [Fri 30 Dec 2016] and the Pelican on [Sat 31 Dec 2016], as result of the equine herpesvirus outbreak at Fair Grounds.

Delta has placed restrictions on horses shipping into the track that would have reduced the field for the Azalea and decimated the Pelican. The Azalea has been rescheduled for [Fri 13 Jan 2017], and the Pelican for [Sat 14 Jan 2017]. The track hopes to be able to ease ship-in restrictions sometime next week [8-14 Jan 2017] if no cases of the virus are discovered at Delta.

[This disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2 and 10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease, and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions.

This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
