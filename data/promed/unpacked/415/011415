Saskatchewan Environment officials say a winter deer hunt has gone well.
The discovery of chronic wasting disease (CWD) near Saskatchewan Landing
Provincial Park during the fall hunting season of 2002 prompted the
department to hold a winter hunting season for white-tailed deer and mule
deer. The hunt continues until 31 Mar 2003. The hunt is being held to get
as many test samples as possible to estimate how many CWD cases there may
be in the area and to reduce the size of the local deer herds.
Bob Roberts with Saskatchewan Environment at Swift Current said the hunt
has been going extremely well. "There has been a significant interest by
the public," said Roberts.
"We have issued approximately 1000 permits so far, and there have been 450
to 500 samples submitted. There are a good number of deer in that area. The
overall population is high there. It is a fairly significant harvest. What
we are after here is herd reduction and more samples from the wild herd to
determine the extent of the disease in the area," Roberts said.
Samples of brain tissue from the deer are taken and tested to see whether
they contain CWD. The deer heads must be kept cold to preserve the brain
tissue. "We have had quite cold weather here for the last couple of weeks,
and so there is not a problem with the heads spoiling prior to getting them
into the University or to the Prairie Diagnostic Services where they are
doing the lab work on them," said Roberts.
Hunters wishing to take advantage of this special hunt require chronic
wasting disease control permits. Each hunter is eligible for 2 free
permits, which will allow them to harvest 2 adult deer, which can be a
combination of white-tailed and or mule deer bucks and does. Hunters may
receive more control permits after they submit the heads of the animals
they have harvested.
"Saskatchewan Landing Provincial Park is inside the herd reduction area.
Within the park the only hunting that we are allowing by the public is with
primitive weapons. But outside of the park in the herd reduction area,
rifle hunting is allowed," Roberts said.
The permits are available at Saskatchewan Environment offices in
Saskatchewan Landing Provincial Park, Swift Current, Saskatoon, Moose Jaw,
and Regina. Deer heads may be dropped off at any Saskatchewan Environment
office. The collection and testing process will be faster if the heads are
dropped off at these offices.
Hunters must not waste the meat of animals taken. But they may wish to
freeze the animals and wait until they receive the test results from heads
they submit before consuming the meat.
