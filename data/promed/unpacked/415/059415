[EFB is caused by the bacterium _Melissococcus plutonius_. Larvae become infected by consuming contaminated food fed by the nurse bees. The bacteria multiply within the larval gut, competing with it for food. They remain in the gut and do not invade larval tissue; larvae that die from the disease do so because they have been starved of food. This normally occurs shortly before the cells are capped. http://www.nationalbeeunit.com/index.cfm?pageid=88
