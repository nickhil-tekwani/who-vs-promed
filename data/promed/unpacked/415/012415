The Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment announced that a case of chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been identified for the 1st time in a Saskatchewan wildlife management zone near Melfort.

The disease is now confirmed in 45 of 83 zones in the province, according to the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment. CWD is a fatal nervous system disease threating deer, elk, moose, and caribou.

Officials said Wednesday [7 Nov 2018] the new case involved a 3-year-old elk bull in zone 42E, south of Melfort. The new case was submitted as part of the voluntary CWD surveillance program.

"The information obtained from the voluntary testing program is critical to evaluating the spread of CWD and guiding our management strategies," wildlife health specialist Dr. Iga Stasiak said in a press release. "Hunters are encouraged to register online before taking their cervid heads to any Ministry of Environment field office. There is no charge for testing, and you will get your results in 2 to 8 weeks."

The disease has not been detected in humans; however, the ministry recommends people do not consume meat from an animal infected with CWD.

So far this year [2018], 34 cases of CWD have been identified in the province.

[Sadly, it seems this disease is continuing to march into new territory. I see the value in testing heads, but the time from submission to answer seems quite long. These hunters may be hoping for fresh meat vs. freshly frozen meat while they wait on results. - Mod.TG
