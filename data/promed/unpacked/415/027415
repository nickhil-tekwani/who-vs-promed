In Yapacani, Ichilo province, health authorities with the help of
mobile teams are trying to deliver the 10 000 doses of yellow fever
vaccine available to the more than 35 000 inhabitants in an attempt to
halt the spread of the disease, in particular towards Santa Cruz de la
Sierra, 135 km to the south.
The Sevicio Departamental de Salud (Sedes) has declared a sanitary
emergency in the area. The first death was registered in the Yapacani
Hospital the 27 Feb 2002, in a woman resident in Nuevo Horizonte, 34
km from Yapacani.
The diagnosis of yellow fever was confirmed by the Centro de
Enfermedades Tropicales (Centrop) in Santa Cruz de la Sierra. The same
Institution has since confirmed a second case in a patient that has
recovered, and a final diagnosis is awaited for a person that died
last Thursday in the same hospital. Another 35 cases are suspected

[Santa Cruz de la Sierra is a major city at the crossroads of
transportation routes to Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina & Peru. The
delay in diagnosis is regrettable, since infected people have had time
to travel to other cities & infect vector moquitoes there. In 1997-98
this happened, and 6 cases were diagnosed in residents of Santa
Cruz -- the first cases of urban transmission of yellow fever in the
Americas in 44 years (see 1997 ref. above, & the CORRECTION reference
which quotes the relevant Lancet article extensively). In Santa Cruz,
vaccine coverage rates were only 35-40%, whereas the herd immunity
required to prevent person-to-person transmission of infection may be
90%.
Health authorities in Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina & Peru should take
notice, & prepare emergency vaccination campaigns. - Mod.JW
