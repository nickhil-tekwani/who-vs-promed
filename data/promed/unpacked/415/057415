Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS) 9 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Parts 74 and 93 Importation and
Interstate Movement of Certain Land Tortoises
We are prohibiting, until further notice, the importation into the United
States (US) of certain land tortoises. We are also prohibiting, until
further notice, the interstate movement of these land tortoises. These
actions are necessary to prevent the introduction and spread of exotic
ticks known to be vectors of heartwater disease, an acute infectious
disease of ruminants. These actions will provide protection against an
outbreak of heartwater disease in domestic and wild populations of
ruminants in the United States.

DATES: This interim rule is effective 22 Mar 2000. However, this rule does
not apply to importations en route to the US. We invite you to comment on
this docket. We will consider all comments we receive by 22 May 2000.
AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.
ACTION: Interim rule and request for comments.
