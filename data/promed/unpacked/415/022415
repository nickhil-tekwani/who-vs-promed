West Nile virus positive _Aedes triseriatus_: Correction
--------------------------------------------------------
On 17 Aug 2000, the New York State Health Department's Wadsworth Laboratory
reported 14 West Nile virus positive mosquito pools: Orange County, 1;
Rockland County, 4 and Suffolk County, 9. It was noted that another species
of infected mosquito, _Aedes triseriatus_, was included in yesterday's
data. It was further stated that this species is among the most common
tree-hole and container-breeding mosquitoes in New York State, and that this
mosquito bites primarily at dawn and dusk and will feed on humans [see: West
Nile virus surveillance - USA (26).
Part of the posting was incorrect. _Aedes triseriatus_, unlike many of its
congeners, is not mostly active at dawn and dusk as the posting states.
Rather, it is active primarily during the daytime, particularly in the
afternoon. If it proves to be a vector of West Nile virus, then warnings to
avoid evening hours when mosquitoes are active will miss this species.
