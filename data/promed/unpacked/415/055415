The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) confirmed on Friday that a
total of 158 head of cattle raised in two ranches in southern Taiwan have
been slaughtered on suspicion of FMD (foot-and-mouth disease) infection.
Ninety-four head of the slaughtered cattle were raised in a ranch in
Hsinhua, Tainan county, and the remaining 64 cattle came from a ranch in
Huwei, Yulin county, COA officials said.
Cattle raised in the two ranches were tested positive to the "type O
Kinmen" FMD virus. Even though no FMD virus was separated from blood
samples of those cattle, the COA ordered slaughter of all animals raised in
the two ranches to stem further spread of the disease.
COA officials said the two ranches have been put under close scrutiny since
cattle raised in three ranches in Shanhua, Tainan county were found to have
been infected with FMD in June. The two ranches had purchased cattle from
the three Shanhua ranches. Despite the new finding, COA officials said they
do not think that the FMD virus had been further spread here. Nevertheless,
they said the COA will further intensify inoculation of all cattle raised
in Taiwan.
In May, cattle raised in some ranches on the offshore frontline island of
Kinmen were found to have been infected with the virus. All of the cattle
raised in those ranches were later slaughtered.
