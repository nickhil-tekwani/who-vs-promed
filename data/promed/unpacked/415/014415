[These outbreaks in the center and north of Morocco are caused by the same
serotype, BTV-1, that earlier in the year (2009) caused outbreaks in
Algeria. Vaccination for high value stock should be considered as we are
currently in the middle of bluetongue season. See Mod.AS comments in
ProMED-mail posting Bluetongue, ovine - Algeria: OIE, BTV-1 20090916.3249.
