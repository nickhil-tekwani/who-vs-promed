An additional 99 patients with signs and symptoms similar to dengue fever
have been admitted to different hospitals across Pakistan, thus bringing the
total number up to 4965 patients in this south Asian country.
Quoting the Pakistani health ministry, a TV channel reported on Sunday [19
Nov 2006] that 39 more patients were declared positive for the dengue virus
during the last 24 hours, increasing the confirmed cases to 1763.
So far, dengue fever has caused 44 deaths in Pakistan, with 43 from the
southern Sindh province and one from the North West Frontier Province. As
many as 825 patients have so far been admitted to different hospitals in the
Pakistani capital of Islamabad and its southern neighbor Rawalpindi with
symptoms like those of dengue fever, and 18 have been declared positive for
the dengue virus. The total number of positive cases of dengue virus in the
twin cities now stands at 324.

[It would be interesting to know which dengue virus type(s) is (are)
circulating during this outbreak and what vector control measures are being
taken. A map of Pakistan can be accessed at:

Dr Hou Sheng-Mao, director general of the Department of Health [DOH] is
concerned about the epidemic situation of dengue fever in the
Kaohsiung-Pingdong region of Taiwan. "An emergent command center for control
of dengue" has been set up on 2 Oct 2006. Since then, the director general
and the vice director general have already visited the area 5 times in
person. Dr Zaijin Chen, vice director general, will make another visit on 22
Nov 2006 to the area for a follow-up inspection. Since 18 Nov [2006], both
Kaohsiung County and City health authorities have reinforced implementation
of a mosquito-elimination campaign.
Since the beginning of this summer until 21 Nov 2006, there have been 720
confirmed cases of dengue fever in the Kaohsiung-Pingdong region (Kaohsiung
City - 528, Kaohsiung County - 173, Pingdong County - 10, Tainan County - 2,
Tainan City - 4, Taipei County - 1, Keelung City - 1, Taichung County - 1).
Among these, there are 15 confirmed cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF]
and 2 deaths. All the DHF patients have already recovered and returned home.
In view of such an epidemic situation, the government re-emphasizes that
collaborative efforts between health authorities and local residents are key
for effective control of the outbreak.

[The dengue outbreak in Taiwan appears to be spreading and intensifying. It
would be interesting to know which dengue virus type(s) is (are) circulating
and how the partnership between the health authorities and local residents
is progressing. A map of Taiwan can be accessed at:
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/taiwan_pol92.jpg>.
WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that affects
infants, young children, and adults but is seldom fatal. The clinical
features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the patient. Infants
and young children may have a non-specific febrile illness with rash
(although some infants and very young children may develop shock syndrome,
with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume, and die). Older children and
adults may have either a mild febrile syndrome or the classical
incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset and high fever, severe headache,
pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with enlargement
of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure. The illness
commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature accompanied by facial
flush and other non-specific constitutional symptoms of dengue fever. The
fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days and can be as high as 40-41 C
(104-105.8 F), possibly with febrile convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena.
In moderate DHF cases, all signs and symptoms abate after the fever
subsides. In severe cases, the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate
after a few days of fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of
circulatory failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical state of
shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover following appropriate
volume replacement therapy. There is no specific treatment for dengue fever.
However, careful clinical management by experienced physicians and nurses
frequently saves the lives of DHF patients. With appropriate intensive
supportive therapy, mortality may be reduced to less than one percent.
Maintenance of the circulating fluid volume is the central feature of DHF
case management. (Abstracted from the WHO website fact sheet on dengue:
