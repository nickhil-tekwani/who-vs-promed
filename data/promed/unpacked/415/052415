On [Wed 25 Apr 2018] the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services received confirmation of one horse in Levy County that tested positive for Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

The 2-year-old Mini Mule became clinical on [Tue 17 Apr 2018] and was humanely euthanized on [Wed 18 Apr 2018] due to a poor prognosis. There was no known vaccination history.

[Eastern equine encephalitis is transmitted by mosquitoes and can be easily prevented by a vaccine. The vaccine is usually combined with western equine encephalitis and West Nile virus and tetanus. The initial vaccine must be followed by a 2nd vaccine in about 3 weeks. The protection to EEE wanes relatively quickly. Therefore, in areas such as Florida and other states bordering the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic Ocean, vaccination should be repeated approximately every 4 months. So folks if you haven't vaccinated please do so.
