[In follow-up reports No. 25 (16 Jan 2017) and No. 26 (17 Mar 2017), no new outbreaks were reported. The most recent 2 LSD outbreaks in Greece prior to the current one were reported to the OIE in follow-up report No. 24 (16 Dec 2016), notifying outbreaks in Central Macedonia and in Ipeiros, which reportedly started on 22 and 24 Nov 2016, respectively. The report, including an interactive map showing the locations of the 2 outbreaks, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=21702.

The follow-up report also included the following epidemiological comments: "Emergency vaccination campaign of cattle against lumpy skin disease has been completed in the entire regional units of Evros, Xanthi, Rhodopi, Kavala, Thessaloniki, Chalkidiki, Serres, Drama, Kilkis, Pieria and Florina. Vaccination campaign is in progress in the regional units of Pella, Imathia, Kozani, Kastoria, Larissa, Trikala, Ioannina, Arta, Magnessia, Limnos Island, Achaia, Argolida, Lakonia and Messinia."

The new outbreak is the 1st one in Ionioi Nisoi (Ionian Islands), on Greece's northwest, facing southwest Albania. It has been reported after an absence of positive cases in Greece since 28 Nov 2016. In Albania, LSD outbreaks continued to be observed up to February 2017.

Details on the vaccination history in the Ionian Islands will be helpful.

LSD was 1st observed in Greece in August-December 2015, controlled with a mass vaccination campaign conducted in the northeastern prefectures. Due to vaccine supply problems, vaccination coverage was not complete, and in April 2016, LSD re-emerged in Serres, from where it further spread within the country and into 5 countries: Bulgaria, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR), Serbia, Albania and Montenegro. All affected countries in Southern Europe implemented mass emergency vaccination campaigns using live-attenuated homologous LSD strain vaccine. Additionally, Croatia in 2016 implemented a preventive mass vaccination campaign.

LSD might reemerge in southeast Europe driven by upcoming weather conditions favourable for vector amplification. The applied vaccination campaigns might mitigate this possibility and the consequent risk of incursion into neighbouring countries (e.g. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Ukraine, and Romania).

An interactive map showing all 225 LSD outbreaks, including the current one, reported from Greece since the start of the event in 18 Aug 2015 is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=18483. - Mod.AS
