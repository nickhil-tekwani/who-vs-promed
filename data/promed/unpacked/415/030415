Atypical BSE case in a young bull
----------------------------------
Although a little late, I am reporting the Western blot data of the 9th
case. We can now compare the results of the recent 4 cases.
No. / Slaughter date / Slaughter place / Age(months) / Results / (remarks)
1/ 21 Jan / Hokkaido / 81 / positive / (7th case)
<http://www.mhlw.go.jp/houdou/2003/01/h0123-3.html>
2 / 5 Feb / Ibaraki / 241 / pending / (but being treated as negative, i.e.
no quarantine of its cohort).
<http://www.mhlw.go.jp/houdou/2003/03/h0327-2.html>
3 / 29 Sep / Kanagawa / 23 / positive / (8th case, a new type?)
<http://www.mhlw.go.jp/houdou/2003/10/h1006-2.html>
4 / 29 Oct / Hiroshima / 21 / positive / (9th case, normal type?)
<http://www.mhlw.go.jp/houdou/2003/11/h1104-3.html>
What follows is my comment on the legends to the figures.
Fig 1. Normal glycoform pattern (Lanes 7 & 8) with spongiform change.
Fig 2. Very faint bands (Lane 5 in the upper figure and Lane 9 in the
lower). Nonglycosylated band is the most prominent only in the sample taken
in screening, i.e., none detected in NIID-1 and -2 (on both sides of the
specimen).
Fig 3. Prominent nonglycosylated band but with high PK sensitivity: almost
nothing with 2x digestion with PK (Lanes 5 & 6), detectable with PTA
precipitation after 1x digestion.
Fig 4. Normal pattern but very smeared (Lanes 4-6). Deglycosylation with
PNGF (Lanes 7 & 8).

[The 9th BSE case in Japan, confirmed 4 Nov 2003 (see 20031105.2742) was --
similar to the 8th case, identified a month earlier -- less than 2 years
old. The Japanese authorities have reportedly stated that its form
(western-blot and immunohistochemistry results?) was similar to those found
in the first 7 "typical" cases in Japan (which were all about 5 years old).
The 8th case was regarded "atypical".
We are grateful to Dr Jun-ichi Ohnishi for kindly forwarding to us these
lab findings, for his translation, and for his explanatory remarks. These
authentic illustrations may enable subscribers experienced in TSE diagnosis
to comment. - Mod.AS]
