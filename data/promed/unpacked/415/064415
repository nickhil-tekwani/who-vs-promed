_Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus_ (CABYV) was found in Dutch cucumber crops earlier. The virus also turned up in Belgium. Much is still unclear about the virus. Trials were set up in the Netherlands to address some questions about its spread within glasshouse crops, with the following results.

Cotton aphids (_Aphis gossypii_) are known to be important vectors for CABYV. In the trials, the incubation period from insect transmission to appearance of symptoms was between 2 and 6 weeks, depending on the age of plants at the time of infection. Green peach aphids (_Myzus persicae_; known to be a poor vector of CABYV) and greenhouse whitefly (_Trialeurodes vaporariorum_) did not transmit the virus in this trial.

Cotton aphids were infectious for at least 3 weeks after acquiring CABYV. The aphids did not pass the virus on to their offspring. Winged aphids could also transmit the virus, which poses a greater risk of introduction of CABYV from outside, as well as faster spread within glasshouses.

[_Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus_ (CABYV; genus _Polerovirus_, Luteoviridae) affects primarily cucurbit crops (such as cucumber, zucchini, melons, pumpkins, squashes) but has also been reported from lettuce, beet, and some legumes (chickpea, broad bean). Symptoms may be confused with nutritional problems and vary with crops, cultivars, and environmental conditions. They may include interveinal yellowing, thickening and brittleness of leaves, complete yellowing of whole plants, and loss of plant vigour leading to reduced flowering and fruit production. Yield losses of up to 50% for cucumbers and 15% for melons have been reported. Similar symptoms in cucurbits can also be caused by some other _Polerovirus_ or _Crinivirus_ species (e.g., see ProMED post 20220318.8702057).

The virus resides in phloem tissue and can be spread by several aphid species in a persistent manner (i.e., insects remain infectious for life). Different aphid species vary in their efficiency of CABYV transmission, with _Aphis gossypii_ being one of the most efficient. Infectious insects can be spread with plant material or carried on air currents for long distances. The virus cannot be transmitted mechanically or by seed. Weed species serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management of aphid-transmitted viruses is difficult and may include vector control, removal of virus reservoirs, phytosanitation, cultural measures (such as barrier plantings), and use of resistant crop cultivars, if available.

The currently known luteoviruses are mostly important crop pathogens and include _Potato leafroll virus_, _Turnip yellows virus_, _Maize yellow mosaic virus_, and several barley yellow dwarf viruses (see previous ProMED posts in the archives).
