Kenya: suspected outbreak of O'nyong-nyong fever in Mombasa
-----------------------------------------------
Health authorities in Mombasa are investigating whether a fever spreading
in the coastal town could be a rare viral disease which causes
O'nyong-nyong fever. They have now issued an alert for the virus, which was
1st reported in East Africa between 1959 and 1962. The fever is often
mistaken for malaria but is not fatal and can be easily managed with simple
treatment.
A circular issued by the Ministry of Health indicated that a few cases had
been reported but were yet to be confirmed pending tests by the Kenya
Medical Research Institute (Kemri). "A few suspected cases have been found
and blood samples taken to Kemri, Nairobi for testing. So far, no case has
been confirmed as O'nyong-nyong fever," according to the circular signed by
Dr. Waudo Siganga of Mombasa's Port Reitz District Hospital. But the
Ministry has instructed its officers to be on the lookout for the disease.
Suspected cases should be referred to the Port Reitz District Hospital, the
Likoni and Mlaleo Health Centers, and the Public Health Department. In
addition, the Ministry called for preventive measures, which include health
education and mosquito control through the use of insecticide treated nets.
The ministry has also advised health officers to treat as suspect patients
who show no sign of improvement a week or more after being treated for malaria.
The fever was also reported in Lamu in August 2004. The fever is caused by
the O'nyong-nyong virus, which gets its name from a phrase in northern
Uganda meaning "very painful and weak". Victims experience high fever,
severe joint pain, headaches, swollen lymph glands, and skin rash. Other
symptoms are eye pain and reddening with no discharge, chest pains, and
general malaise. Recovery from the acute symptoms usually takes about 2
weeks, but joint pain can persist. The infection can cause miscarriage in
pregnant women.
There is no specific treatment for O'nyong-nyong fever other than symptom
relief and rest. No serious long-term effects have ever been reported
following infection. The fever is spread by the _Anopheles_ mosquito, also
associated with malaria. All age groups and both sexes are equally
affected. In areas where the disease is epidemic, 60 to 80 percent of the
people may be infected. The 1st epidemic is said to have occurred in
1959-1962 in Northern Uganda -- where it apparently got its name --
affecting an estimated 2 million people in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. In
1996-1997, after an apparent absence of about 35 years, the 1st
re-emergence of the fever occurred in South-Central Uganda. The disease
spread into the neighboring Mbarara and Masaka districts of Uganda and in
the bordering Bukoba district of northern Tanzania. Contacted yesterday
[Wed 8 Dec 2004] in Kampala, Dr. Ambrose Talisuna, the Acting Commissioner
of National Disease Control in Uganda's Ministry of Health, recalled that
O'nyong-nyong fever hit western Uganda briefly in 1996 but could not be
referred to as an epidemic.

[O'nyong-nyong virus is closely related phylogenetically to Chikungunya
virus (23 percent nucleotide and 14 percent amino acid sequence
divergence), and the diseases associated with the 2 viruses are very
similar. Both viruses are classified as virus species in the genus
_Alphavirus_ (family _Togaviridae_). O'nyong-nyong virus, however, is
geographically restricted to East Africa, whereas Chikungunya virus is more
widely distributed, causing extensive epidemics in south-east Asia and
India as well as in southeast Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. - Mod.CP]
