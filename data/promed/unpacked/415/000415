EHRLICHIOSIS, CANINE (5)
========================
I have enjoyed this discussion regarding various strains of Ehrlichia and
what animals they show up in (horses, dogs, humans, etc.) I don't recall if
I mentioned as yet my own experience with E. risticii in my dogs (another
horse strain - this is the one that causes Potomac Fever in horses; there is
a vaccine for horses, but not for dogs.) This first showed up in my dogs in
1990 - I have since been collecting case histories on dogs infected with E.
risticii; also dogs infected with E. canis. E. risticii HAS been cultured
from a dog by Dr. I. Kakoma, DVM, PhD at the University of Illinois. In
fact, it was cultured from a Border Terrier owned by a good friend of mine.
(I am a breeder/owner of several Border Terriers.) In Illinois, the
risticii strain is at least as prevalent in our terriers as the canis strain,
if not more so. Signs are very similar to E. canis, except that risticii in
the acute stage usually causes diarrhea (just as it does in horses) and it
often causes vomiting - this may be vomiting of bile only. As is the case
with many other species of ehrlichia, signs of risticii infection seem to wax
and wane and vary depending on the individual dog. If anything, the signs of
chronic risticii infection may be even more subtle than those of other
strains. Yet it can and does seriously affect the animal (even though
original studies of artificially-infected dogs suggested otherwise.) Some
dogs may get along for years, though it seems to catch up with them
eventually, causing a variety of secondary problems such as chronic ear
infections, urinary tract infections, back and neck pain, neurological signs,
and overall a seemingly accelerated aging process (the animal turns grayish,
is stiff in the joints, loses muscle mass, coat becomes dry and unthrifty and
there is a general lethargy in the animals behaviour.) Because signs vary
from dog to dog and perhaps breed to breed, risticii is very hard to
diagnose. Making things even more frustrating is the fact that the vector
for E. risticii has yet to be identified. Attempted transmission with ticks
in the laboratory has failed thus far. An experiment with oral transmission
in horses (as published in Equi magazine) apparently succeeded, though very
large amounts of infected manure were fed to the animal, which is not likely
to occur in a natural setting. Based on my own case histories, I suspect
fleas and/or mites as the vector (mites could have a distinct advantage in
spreading organisms from one animal species to another in that they are
often quite non-specific in the hosts they reside on - the same species of
mite could conceivably infect horses, dogs, people, cats, etc.) They are
also usually not visible to the naked eye, making them all the more efficient
in going undetected. Risticii infection can also be deadly - my oldest Border
Terrier succumbed to chronic risticii infection after we had spent 3 months
trying to figure out what was wrong with the dog. Her signs were, at the
time, different from what I had previously observed - severe back and neck
pain in the acute phase; then roughly 2 years later, seizures, vomiting of
bile, high blood calcium, head tremor, high alkaline phosphatase, (other
liver enzymes were normal), intermittent diarrhea sometimes containing bile,
incontinence, sparse, dry coat, etc. She was tested for a wide variety of
diseases and ailments - even had surgery when cancer was suspected. She died
of an apparent massive stroke - necropsy revealed a severely damaged heart
(heart disease had never been diagnosed) which had been caused by an
infectious process. 3 weeks prior to death, titers were run for E. risticii
and E. canis - she was positive for E. risticii. My other terriers have been
successfully treated with doxycycline, but getting information out regarding
this disease has been a real challenge. Bob Wilson and I, with the help of
Dr. Kakoma, Sue Netboy and others, have written an article about E. canis
and E. risticii which can be retrieved under the address:
