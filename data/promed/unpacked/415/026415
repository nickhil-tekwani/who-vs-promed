The Ministry of Health of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has
reported 5323 suspected cases of meningococcal disease, including 333
deaths (case-fatality rate: 6.3 percent) from 1 Jan to 22 Feb 2009.
Suspected cases have been reported from 22 of 37 states. So far 89
Local Government Areas (LGA) across 12 states have crossed the alert
or the epidemic threshold. In the last week alone, 1817 suspected
cases including 105 deaths (case-fatality rate: 5.8 percent) have
been reported, with 28 LGAs crossing the epidemic threshold, and 29
the alert threshold.

Cerebrospinal fluid specimens collected from Gombe, Jigawa, Kano, and
Katsina states have tested positive for _Neisseria meningitidis_
serogroup A by latex test and/or culture. The International
Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis
Control has approved the release of 1 010 000 doses of polysaccharide
vaccine for mass vaccination campaigns in affected LGAs of Jigawa and
Katsina states. Immunization campaigns will be implemented by Federal
and National Ministry of Health with the support of WHO and partners,
including the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Department (ECHO),
Medecins sans Frontieres, and UNICEF.

Given the large population at risk, the early start of epidemics, and
current moderate global vaccine levels, a sound vaccination strategy
is of particular importance. WHO is supporting the Federal and
National Ministry of Health in the assessment of vaccine needs. WHO
is also providing technical and material support to the Ministry of
Health to strengthen epidemiological and laboratory surveillance,
including provision of laboratory confirmation supplies.

[The number of cases of suspected meningococcal meningitis in Nigeria
has approximately quadrupled and the number of deaths tripled since
the last ProMED-mail post (Meningitis, meningococcal - Nigeria: WHO
20090220.0709). The plan is to use meningococcal polysaccharide
vaccine in the population at risk, but it is unclear if any vaccine
has actually been given out as yet.
