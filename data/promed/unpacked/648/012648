Local, state officials to probe Casper area illnesses
-------------------------------------
CASPER, Wyo. - City of Casper-Natrona County Health Department officials
plan to work with state and federal agencies to find out what's sickening
residents just north of town. Residents of the Ormsby Road area have been
complaining of sore throats, burning eyes, headaches, nausea and vomiting.
Some blame Defense Technology, a nearby plant making tear gas.
Officials are writing a questionnaire which health department director Bob
Harrington hopes will provide data for further inquiries. However, "It can
be very vague and difficult to draw conclusions," he said of such an
approach.
Last Friday, a conference call tied Harrington's agency in with state
health officials, the state Department of Environmental Quality and the
federal Environmental Protection Agency. "We don't have the expertise, but
we'll be doing much of the labor," he said. Joyce Ackerman of the EPA said
she and a technician will take some samples Friday.
Burning eyes, noses and throats; headaches; nausea and vomiting are all
well-known symptoms of tear gas exposure. Other reported symptoms like
memory loss, chronic weakness and depressed immune systems are not
generally associated with exposure to tear gas, agreed toxicologists.
Defense Technology employs 82 people in the Casper area: 14 at 9125 Neosho
Road and the rest at its South Loop Avenue facilities just north of Casper.
