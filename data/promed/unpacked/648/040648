Conclusion
----------
Leishmaniasis should be a public health priority in Greece because the visceral form of the disease is endemic in almost all areas of the country, it causes severe symptoms and mostly affects young children.

In addition, there is a risk of introduction of new _Leishmania_ species, especially in connection with migration from endemic countries. Therefore, a sustainable action plan for leishmaniasis prevention and control in the context of a One Health approach should be developed, including enhanced surveillance and laboratory capacity, reservoir and vector control, timely diagnosis and treatment of cases, as well as health education and communication campaigns for the public.

[The complete paper is available at the source URL above. It describes the epidemiology of cutaneous (CL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Greece over a 15-year period.

The study shows that VL continues to be endemic in Greece as domestic cases are recorded every year across the country.

A considerable proportion of VL cases and more than 1/3 of fatal VL cases were immunocompromised. The intriguing aspect is that people can probably be infected with _Leishmania_ causing visceral leishmaniasis that is asymptomatic but developing clinical VL if they become immunocompromised. - Mod.EP
