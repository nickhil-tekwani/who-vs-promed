Scrub typhus is giving nightmares to health authorities as the people tested positive for the disease are constantly increasing in Kota and Jaipur divisions. In the past 30 days, this disease has affected 275 people and caused 9 deaths in the state.

The scrub typhus disease, which was first reported in Alwar in 2011, has spread to other parts of the state and victimized 408 people in Rajasthan so far this year [2014]. On [17 Sep 2014], 133 scrub typhus cases were reported with 4 deaths. Since then, there is a sudden hike in cases reported in the past one month. The doctors in the affected districts are checking patients for fever to find out if the patient has rashes on the body, which is a common symptom of the disease.

According to health department figures, only 9 cases of scrub typhus were reported in 2011 and Alwar was the affected district that year. But the figures are constantly increasing every year. In 2012, there were 223 positive cases, which further increased to 513 in 2013. Now, so far till October this year [2014], 408 cases of scrub typhus have already been reported.

Health director BR Meena said the disease spreads during monsoon. Treatment is available and is simple. It can be treated by doxycycline tablets.

This year [2014], the focus of the disease shifted to Kota, Baran, Jhalawar, and Bundi area. Out of every 100 cases, 43 were reported from the 4 districts. The health department officials are on their toes in the 4 districts. They identified 450 suspected cases in Kota, Baran, Jhalawar, and Bundi districts. 172 cases were tested positive.

The health department officials said since the disease is caused by the bite of a mite known as chigger, it can be prevented by taking proper precautions. They said if a person is moving out in the grass or in vegetation, they can cover their feet so that the mite are not able to bite them.

The health department figures show that Jaipur reported 51 cases, while there were 31 positive cases in Alwar. Like dengue and malaria, the health department is monitoring scrub typhus cases too, as its victims are constantly on the rise. It is difficult for the doctors to diagnose it, as the symptoms of the disease are similar to dengue and malaria. The common symptoms are headache, high fever and rash.
