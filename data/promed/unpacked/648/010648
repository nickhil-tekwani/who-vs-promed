An outbreak of bird flu was recorded in the northern area of the
state of Veracruz, affecting 78 animals, which have already been
slaughtered. Efrain Acosta Martinez, chief of the animal health
program of SAGARPA [Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural
Development, Fishing, and Food] indicated that, in any case,
surveillance continues, and an epidemiological barrier is already in
place to stop the disease from spreading.

Acosta Martinez added: "We have some outbreaks of avian influenza in
backyards in the north, but we are already working hard [to control
the situation]. We have evacuated the premises where the disease was
detected, and we can say that we have it under control."

The federal official also stated that the 78 cases were not detected
in poultry farms but in animals raised in backyards. After the
slaughter of the birds and epidemiological surveillance of the area,
Veracruz retains its "free of avian flu" status. He explained that
whenever a focus is detected, reaction has to be quick in order for
the state to maintain its free-of-disease status; producers are
compensated, [infected] animals are slaughtered, and long-term
surveillance of the zone is implemented.

[This is stated to be a low pathogenic strain, although the strain
type is not provided. In 2006 there was an outbreak of H5N2, low
pathogenic in Chiapas state in southern Mexico. The officials are
certainly taking it seriously. Ongoing surveillance is necessary to
fully root out the disease from the back yard flocks. Information on
the specific strain of avian influenza virus identified would be appreciated.
