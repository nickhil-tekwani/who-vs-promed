An unusually high number of students and teachers at a school in southwestern Germany have been infected with tuberculosis. Health officials are scouring the school for clues about why the disease spread.

Health officials on Thursday [1 Aug 2019] examined a school in the southwestern German town of Bad Schonborn where a tuberculosis outbreak has infected dozens of children and adults.

A total of 109 students, teachers and other school employees have been infected, the district administration of Karlsruhe said. Four people, including at least 2 students, have active cases of tuberculosis. That means they are presenting symptoms and could be contagious. The actively sick students have been removed from the school and are receiving medical treatment, the district administration said.

"We cannot rule out the possibility that there will be new cases of active illness," Ulrich Wagner from the Karlsruhe health department told the Badische Neueste Nachrichten newspaper.

At the beginning of July [2019], 2 children at 2 different schools in Bad Schonborn were found to have active tuberculosis. Since then, the number of infected people has continued to rise, particularly at the Michael Ende Gemeinschaftsschule, where a student in the 8th grade was initially infected. Officials said that some 56 students in the 8th grade -- 88% of the entire class -- are currently infected.

The case is concerning because several children from different grades as well as teachers who would not have been greatly exposed to the 8th grade students have also tested positive for the infection.

Health officials are now examining the school's classrooms to determine how the bacteria were able to spread to so many people, local public broadcaster SWR reported.

Local officials emphasized that tuberculosis is a treatable and curable illness, adding that not everyone who is infected with the disease will become sick.

Tuberculosis is caused by bacteria that spread from person to person through tiny droplets released into the air by coughing and sneezing. When active, tuberculosis most often affects the lungs -- resulting in chest pain, fever, weight loss, and coughing that lasts for weeks. Sometimes blood is coughed up. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around a quarter of the world's population is infected with latent tuberculosis -- meaning they are not actively ill and cannot transmit the disease.

The WHO says that those who are infected with tuberculosis bacteria have a 5% to 15% chance of becoming sick.

[The news report above says that a total of 109 students, teachers and other school employees at possibly 2 schools in Bad Schonborn have been infected, but only 4 of the 109 people, including at least 2 students, have active cases of tuberculosis (TB), the others presumably having latent tuberculous infection (LTBI). LTBI is a non-contagious form of TB and is detected by tuberculin skin testing or interferon-gamma release assays.

We are told that the 2 students with active TB are at 2 different schools in Bad Schonborn, but we are not told anything about the 2 adults with active TB; adults are usually thought to be better disseminators of TB than young children. A total of 56 of the students in the 8th grade -- 88% of the entire class at one of the schools -- are infected, but the source for this outbreak has not as yet been identified.

Although transmission of tuberculosis is thought to usually require close, repeated or prolonged contact with a contagious individual in a poorly ventilated environment, such as households, homeless shelters or schools, outbreaks of cases with TB due to genetically linked TB strains who do not have anything in common other than living in the same neighborhood or using the same public facilities such as food markets or cybercafes at a shopping mall have been described.

Bad Schonborn, with a population of 13 028 residents, is a town in northern Karlsruhe district in Baden-Wurttemberg, a state in southwest Germany (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Schonborn).

More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
