[The following information was submitted by Lizz Kopecny of Sydney,
Australia. News on the spread of sugar cane smut in Queensland (eastern
Australia) was in the Sydney Morning Herald today (17 Jun 2006). - Mod.JAD]

Smut disease scare in Queensland sugarcane
-----------------------------------------------
This is not the 1st appearance of the fungus. The Queensland Department of
Primary Industries and Fisheries (DPI&F) states that "sugarcane smut was
1st found in Australia in 1998 in the Ord River, Western Australia. That
industry now grows only smut resistant varieties. The latest outbreak of
sugarcane smut was found on a farm near Childers in Queensland in early
June 2006 by a plant productivity officer from the local productivity
services group. The sample was diagnosed and confirmed by BSES Ltd and the
Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries (DPI&F)."

[The crop plant sugarcane, _Saccharum officinarum_, develops symptoms of
the disease smut when infected by the fungus _Ustilago scitaminea_.
Sugarcane smut was 1st noted in South Africa in 1877. At one time or
another, sugarcane smut has been important in nearly every sugarcane
growing country in the world. Australia has been a major exception, since
the disease was present only in western Australia, a minor production area.
In a posting on 12 June 2006 (20060612.1643), it was reported that the
distribution in Australia now extends to Queensland and therefore eastern
Australia, the major sugarcane production area. This will be considered a
serious new problem for their industry.
The submission by Lizz Kopecny adds the information that resistant
varieties are grown in western Australia, where sugarcane smut is already
present, as noted in the previous posting (20060612.1643) and emphasized in
the article submitted. This information points the way to how the disease
is likely to be managed in eastern Australia as and when it becomes a
serious problem.
