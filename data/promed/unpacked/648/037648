1. The memory deficits reported in this and previous probable Pfiesteria
episodes are at least reminiscent of more profound memory deficits seen
after the ingestion of shellfish containing domoic acid.
See the following references:
Teitelbaum JS, Zatorre RJ, Carpenter S, Gendron D, Evans AC, Gjedde A,
Cashman NR. Neurologic sequelae of domoic acid intoxication due to the
ingestion of contaminated mussels. New England Journal of Medicine
322(25):1781

Perl TM, Bedard L, Kosatsky T, Hockin JC, Todd ECD, Remis RS. Outbreak of
toxic encephalopathy caused by eating mussels contaminated with domoic
acid. New England Journal of Medicine 322 (25):1775
2. Presumably the "brain scan" detected metabolic abnormalities in areas
associated with short term memory in the hippocampus and its projections.
Most likely, the scan was either a functional MRI which would show
decreased blood flow to hypometabolic areas or a PET scan which would show
decreased fluoro-deoxyglucose uptake. Neither would be helpful in deciding
on a treatment (primarily because I don't believe there is any treatment to
be offered).
It would also be very difficult to arrange either study unless you could
find a research group with an interest and scanner time.
