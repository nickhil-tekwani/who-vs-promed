[Previously, an outbreak of rabbit haemorrhagic disease was detected in Norway in May 2022 and the event was resolved in June 2022. Four domestic rabbits were affected by RHDV2. The outbreak was in Vekkomsv, Ringebu, Innlandet. See report at https://wahis.woah.org/#/in-review/4685?fromPage=event-dashboard-url

"Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly contagious and acute fatal hepatitis of the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_), caused by a calicivirus (genus Lagovirus). Up to 2010, all RHD viruses (RHDV) isolated belonged to one of the 6 identified genotypes (GI-GVI), among which the GVI is an antigenic subtype (RHDVa). In 2010, an additional RHDV was identified, phylogenetically and antigenically distinct from RHDV and provisionally called RHDV2 or RHDVb. A similar disease, termed European brown hare syndrome (EBHS), has been described in the hare (_Lepus europaeus_).

"RHD is characterised by high morbidity and a mortality of 70-90% for RHDV/RHDVa and 5-70% for RHDV2. Infection mainly occurs by the oral route. In wild rabbits, in particular, insects are considered an important route of infection or transmission and are often the source of long-distance spread. The incubation period of RHD varies from 1 to 3 days, and death usually occurs 12-36 hours after the onset of fever. The main clinical manifestations of acute infection are nervous and respiratory signs, apathy, and anorexia. In rabbits younger than 4-6 weeks, the RHDV/RHDVa infection course is subclinical, but when the causative agent is RHDV2, clinical signs and mortality are observed even in young animals from 15 to 20 days of age onwards."

"There is no indication that any lagoviruses infect humans."
