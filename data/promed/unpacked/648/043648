Regarding the brucellosis outbreak in Idaho
-----------------------------------------------
The Idaho State Department of Agriculture (ISDA) quarantined a ranch
in Bonneville County's Swan Valley, after the department's Veterinary
Medical Officers identified a possible case of brucellosis in cattle.
A cow that reacted positively to a brucellosis test through the
Market Cattle Inspection Program under the Cooperative State-Federal
Brucellosis Eradication Program was traced to the Swan Valley ranch.
ISDA Veterinary Medical Officers tested the entire herd for
brucellosis. 10 additional cows reacted positively to these tests.
Further tests [milk cultures from the suspect cows] were conducted in
accordance with the USDA's Uniform Methods and Rules for the
Eradication of Brucellosis. These tests confirmed the animals are
infected with _Brucella abortus_ Biovar 1.
This herd of 39 cows, 2 bulls, and about 25 suckling calves has been
depopulated.
The cattle are run year around on the owner's deeded ground. The
owner claims limited exposure to elk populations. The ranch is about
1000 acres, of which about 800 acres may be pastured at various times
of the year.
No females have been purchased for at least 10 years. The last bulls
were purchased in December 2003. There is no fence line contact with
any other cattle.
This ranch is situated in an area through which numerous elk migrate
in spring and fall. There are also elk that are winter residents in
this area. This ranch is also located near the Idaho Fish and Game
Rainey Creek feedground.
This feedground has been in existence since the late 70s to keep elk
from depredating on haystacks and cattle feedlines.
IDFG and ISDA has a trap, test and removal program on this feedground
for seropositive elk. The apparent seropositive rate on this
feedground has ranged from a high of 45 percent in 1999 to a low of 6
percent in 2005.
Up to 500 elk are fed at this site, depending on temperature, snow
depth and risk to cattle near the mouth of Rainey Creek Canyon.
Brucellosis Biovar 1 and 4 have been isolated from elk on or from
this feedground when tested and removed at the trap in Rainey Creek.
It has been 3 years since the last case of brucellosis was identified
in Idaho. Prior to the case in 2002, the most recent case in Idaho
was in 1989. Pending conclusion of the investigation into this most
recent case, Idaho may lose its Brucellosis Class Free status held
since 1991.
The ISDA and USDA are conducting an epidemiological investigation
that includes identification and testing of all herds that had
contact with the quarantined herd.
