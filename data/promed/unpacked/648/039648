[A 15 Mar 2014 report published in France-Guyane (http://www.franceguyane.fr/actualite/education-sante-environnement/les-sentinelles-veillent-sur-les-barbadines-191002.php) quoted Pierre Chadenat, of the territorial government as saying "We have been alerted about 2 cases in [the area of Matoury on Monday [10 Mar 2014]. Then 12 on Tuesday [11 Mar 2014] "... These cases are not yet confirmed by the Regional Health Agency (ARS). It was also reported that a swimming pool had hundreds of larvae. Virus transmission continues and there are new cases. The InVS report states: "Since the identification of an epidemic focus in Kourou on 19 Feb 2014, a total of 29 confirmed cases (19 autochthonous and 10 imported) and 2 probable cases have been recorded. Spatial distribution of the cases: the majority (72 percent) of the confirmed or probable cases was identified in Kourou. The other autochthonous cases were recorded in Cayenne, Remire-Montjoly, and Macouria." - Mod.TY]

[2] ECDC review: Caribbean Basin
Date: 9-15 Mar 2014

On 6 Dec 2013, France reported 2 laboratory-confirmed autochthonous cases of chikungunya [virus infections] in the French part of the Caribbean island of Saint Martin. Since then, local transmission has been confirmed in the Dutch part [St Maarten], on Martinique, St Barthelemy, Guadeloupe, British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Anguilla, and French Guiana. Aruba only reported imported cases. This is the 1st documented outbreak of chikungunya [fever] with autochthonous transmission in the Americas. As of 14 Mar 2014, there have been more than 12 000 probable and confirmed cases in the region. There have been 4 fatalities reported.

During the past week [9-15 Mar 2014] the number of new cases reported increased in some of the affected areas but at a lower rate then the previous weeks. No new affected areas or islands were reported. The islands affected are St Martin/St Maarten, Martinique, St Barthelemy, Guadeloupe, Virgin Islands (UK), Anguilla, Dominica, Aruba, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and French Guiana in mainland South America. In some territories of the French Antilles, given the load of cases, the health authorities decided not to seek laboratory confirmation for all suspected cases.

[4] Saint Lucia: suspected cases
Date: Sat 15 Mar 2014

Nahum Jn Baptiste, Chief Epidemiologist for the Ministry of Health, [said], "We have submitted 3 suspect cases of chikungunya [virus infection] to the Caribbean Health Public Agency, because we do not have the capacity to do the chikungunya test here in Saint Lucia. We have not gotten confirmation on the cases as yet because normally that would take about 2 weeks. I think with the fact that there have been outbreaks in some of the other Caribbean countries, we may have been put on the back burner," said Jn Baptiste.

He went on to confirm that the 3 cases suspected for chikungunya were submitted last week and that these were the 1st set of suspected cases that they have had.

"Based on the symptoms, some of the cases we have had, persons are not presenting with the classic joint pain. So what we do when we have a negative dengue with the joint pain, we submit it to the Caribbean Health Public Agency. So it's only 3 suspect cases have been found so far."

Jn Baptiste continued: "Truth be told, we started to actually actively look for it last week. So we've sensitized our doctors, hospital staff, and surveillance staff so they are actively looking for symptoms and signs of the illness as of last week. But we will definitely be strengthening our surveillance because we realize now that there has been an outbreak in Martinique and Dominica to a certain extent.

[The virus continues to move in the Caribbean, with Saint Lucia as a new locality, if the laboratory tests confirm the 3 suspected cases as chikungunya virus infections.
