set up to prevent further spread.

[Now, another region of the Caucasus has been declared infected with
swine fever. The last outbreak was registered in Nagorno Karabakh in
April 2008. - Mod.NR]

[North Ossetia (since 1994 officially named "the Republic of North
Ossetia-Alania"), is an autonomous republic of the Russian Federation,
bordering, on its south, Georgia's region of South Ossetia; on its
east, Ingushetia, and on its north and east, the Russian Federation
(east - Kabardino-Balkaria, north - Stavropol). See maps at
<http://www.generationaldynamics.com/ww2010/caucas3s.gif> and

Russia has, so far, sent the OIE immediate notification (4 Dec 2007)
and 2 follow-up reports on the outbreak in Chechnya (30 Jan and 16 Jun
2008). Confirmatory (or otherwise) information on the North Ossetia's
ASF situation, and -- if affirmative -- an OIE report, are
anticipated. - Mod.AS]
