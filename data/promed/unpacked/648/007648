On 20 Jul 2009, for the 1st time since the year 2000, anthrax was
confirmed by the LGL (Bavarian Institute for Health and the Safety of
the food chain).

Cattle on 2 farms in Southern Bavaria (Rosenheim, close to the border
with Austria) have been found to be infected. A total of 4 heifers,
grazing in fields separated only by a road, fell ill and died.
Another animal has been euthanized at the Veterinary Clinic of the
LMU in Munich. On post mortem 3 of the animals showed signs
suspicious of anthrax which was later confirmed by LGL.

The affected farms were put under restrictions; the animals had to be
housed and quarantined. If no additional cases of anthrax are
detected restrictions will be lifted in 2 weeks.

[Reappearances of anthrax years after its apparent eradication are
usually a result of earth-moving events on the farm which disturb an
old cattle grave or buried contaminated tannery waste. There has been
heavy rain in the region which possibly could have floated spores up
out of an old grave. The German veterinary services are very thorough
so I am optimistic that they will find out what happened. Our thanks
to Sabine for bringing this event to our notice. - Mod.MHJ]

[This confirms the LGL newsletter release above with the confirmation
of cause of death by bacterial culture and PCR analysis on 21 July
2009. The source of the heifers' infections is presently unknown.
Updates are promised. - Mod.MHJ]
