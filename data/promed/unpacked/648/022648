"Unprotected workers cleaned up 'Ebola Vomit' in Dallas

"3 Oct 2014 (Prison Planet): Image shows unprotected workers cleaning up 'Ebola Vomit' in Dallas
http://www.prisonplanet.com/shock-image-shows-unprotected-workers-cleaning-up-ebola-vomit-in-dallas.html

"[Pressure water cleaning aerosolizes vomit. Contaminated areas needed to be cordoned off from passersby and cleaned by workers wearing gloves, boots and masks at a minimum. I hope these 2 workers are being followed up. - Mod.JW]"

This is a hoax -- probably gone viral on the internet. I should have known not to trust a recognizable conspiracy website. The photo was taken on Thu 2 Oct 2014, days after he vomited, and any virus would have been killed by drying and sunlight ultra-violet radiation long ago. Dead viruses are not revived by water.

[Somebody is bound to write in "But doctor, viruses can be frozen alive in protein-containing water-based solutions." Like vomit. True -- but it's just not that cold and wet on a Dallas sidewalk in September! So there was no hazard to those workers. Period. - Mod.JW]

Electronic records flaw
-----------------------
3 Oct 2014 (Texas Health): Clarification from Texas Health Resources. We would like to clarify a point made in the statement released earlier in the week. As a standard part of the nursing process, the patient's travel history was documented and available to the full care team in the electronic health record (EHR), including within the physician's workflow. There was no flaw in the EHR in the way the physician and nursing portions interacted related to this event ... [But see below. - Mod.JW].

In response to questions raised about D.'s 1st visit to the hospital emergency department on the night of 25 Sep 2014, we have thoroughly reviewed the chain of events. In the interest of transparency, and because we want other US hospitals and providers to learn from our experience, we are, with D.'s permission, releasing this information ...

- When he was asked whether he had nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, he said no.
- Additionally, D.'s symptoms were not severe at the time he 1st visited the hospital emergency department.
- When D. was asked if he had been around anyone who had been ill, he said that he had not.
- D. was asked if he had traveled outside the United States in the last 4 weeks, and he said that he had been in Africa.

The nurse entered that information in the nursing workflow of the electronic health record.

[Note there is no record of the name Liberia. Other news reports said he had been asked whether he had touched the body of anyone who had died in an area affected by Ebola, and he answered no. (Of course, the sick person was not dead at the time he carried her indoors back at the house.) - Mod.JW] ...

Protocols were followed by both the physician and the nurses.

However, we have identified a flaw in the way the physician and nursing portions of our electronic health records (EHR) interacted in this specific case. In our electronic health records, there are separate physician and nursing workflows. The documentation of the travel history was located in the nursing workflow portion of the EHR ... As designed, the travel history would not automatically appear in the physician's standard workflow.

As result of this discovery, Texas Health Dallas has relocated the travel history documentation to a portion of the EHR that is part of both workflows. It also has been modified to specifically reference Ebola-endemic regions in Africa. We have made this change to increase the visibility and documentation of the travel question in order to alert all providers. We feel that this change will improve the early identification of patients who may be at risk for communicable diseases, including Ebola.

Ebola case blood test delay may have violated federal guidelines
----------------------------------------------------------------
State and local health officials waited more than 2 days to perform crucial blood tests that confirmed a Dallas patient was the nation's 1st Ebola case, a delay that appears to have violated federal guidelines. State health officials say they were alerted about 8 p.m. Sunday [28 Sep 2014] by the Dallas County health department to a suspicious case involving a patient who had arrived recently from Liberia. His symptoms were consistent with Ebola. However, instead of sending a blood specimen for immediate testing for Ebola, as suggested by guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, local health officials spent the next 24 hours doing other bloodwork and testing to apparently rule out other causes.

[Well, the state lab probably has a bio-safety level 3 lab because of the risk from tuberculosis in respiratory specimens, but I doubt if blood work is done with the same precautions and PPE (personal protective equipment). I hope the blood lab techs are among those people being closely monitored. - Mod.JW]

Canada: Toronto hospital patient kept in isolation tests negative for Ebola
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

USA: CDC officials meet flight after passenger from Liberia shows possible Ebola symptoms
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4 Oct 2014 (ABC News): A United Airlines flight from Brussels [Belgium] was met by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] officials today [4 Oct 2014] at Newark Liberty International Airport [New Jersey, USA] after a passenger on board believed to be from Liberia exhibited possible signs of Ebola. The passenger was traveling with his daughter on United Flight 998 and both were removed from the plane by CDC crew in full hazmat gear. Other passengers remained on the plane while the 2 were being removed.... "Medical professionals instructed that customers and crew of United flight 988 remain on board until they could assist an ill customer," the statement said. "We are working with authorities and will accommodate our customers as quickly as we can."

USA: Ebola ruled out in 2 suspected cases in Washington DC region
-----------------------------------------------------------------
4 Oct 2014 (Baltimore Sun): Howard University Hospital in Washington DC quarantined a patient Friday [3 Oct 2014] who had recently traveled to Nigeria out of "an abundance of caution," officials said. On Saturday [4 Oct 2014], officials said the hospital, in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had determined the patient did not have Ebola.

Shady Grove Adventist Hospital in Rockville [Maryland, USA] also determined late Friday [3 Oct 2014] that their patient had malaria, not Ebola. The unidentified patient was isolated after arriving with suspicious symptoms and travel history. Ebola, malaria and cholera have similar symptoms early on, including fever and vomiting.... Maryland is one of 13 states capable of testing for Ebola, in tandem with the CDC and with its authorization.... -- more

USA: National nurse survey shows hospitals still not prepared for US Ebola patients
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3 Oct 2014 (RNRN Press Release): 80 percent say their hospital has not provided policy for admission of potential infected patients. Following reports that a Dallas hospital failed to hospitalize a patient infected with the Ebola virus and failed to properly communicate essential information to caregivers about his health status, National Nurses United is stepping up the call on US hospitals to immediately upgrade emergency preparations for Ebola in the US. Several weeks ago, National Nurses United began surveying registered nurses across the US about emergency preparedness. Most of the nurses are telling NNU that their hospital is not prepared for the Ebola virus. In updated preliminary results from nearly 700 RNs at over 250 hospitals in 31 states released Friday [3 Oct 2014].... -- more

Proposals to restrict air travel
--------------------------------
3 Oct 2014 (New York Times): Federal officials flatly rejected the idea of expanding the screening of passengers arriving from West Africa, and said they would not support calls for a ban on travel to the United States from countries being ravaged by the disease. They said such moves would be ineffective and, at worst, could prevent medical workers and other assistance from reaching Africa. "We believe those types of steps actually impede the response," Lisa Monaco, the president's homeland security adviser, said of proposals to restrict air travel. "They impede and slow down the ability of the United States and other international partners to actually get expertise and capabilities and equipment into the affected areas." Representative Tim Murphy, Republican of Pennsylvania, the chairman of a health oversight committee in the House, said he was "deeply concerned" about the travel decision, and said his committee would hold a hearing in about 2 weeks to examine the government's response.

Survival of ebolavirus on laundry
---------------------------------
4 Oct 2014 (Dallas News): "Ebola dried on surfaces can survive for several hours, according to the CDC. For example, people might get infected by handling soiled clothing or bed sheets and then touching their nose, mouth or eyes, or if they are not wearing gloves while doing those tasks and have a cut on their hand."

[Note that the link to CDC's Interim Guidance for Environmental Infection Control in Hospitals for Ebola Virus in ProMED-mail post Ebola virus disease - ex Africa (03): USA ex Liberia, Germany case ex S. Leone 20141003.2830392 was updated on 3 Oct 2014, after I viewed it, to delete the sentence "There is no epidemiologic evidence of Ebola virus transmission via ... laundry."

In any case, according to the housewife, the bedsheets had not been touched for several days -- i.e., for much more than "several hours." - Mod.JW]
