Tilapia lake virus disease, Chinese Taipei
------------------------------------------
Information received on 14 Jun 2017 from Dr Tai-Hwa Shih, Chief Veterinary Officer, Deputy Director General, Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine Council of Agriculture Executive Yuan, Ministry of Agriculture, Taipei, Chinese Taipei

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 1 Jun 2017
Date of confirmation of the event: 12 Jun 2017
Report date: 13 Jun 2017
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 6.4 percent
Mortality: 6.4 percent
Zoonotic impact: No
Causal agent: Tilapia lake virus (TiLV)

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Pond, Guanyin district, Taoyuan City
Date of start of the outbreak: 1 Jun 2017
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Pond
Water type: Fresh water
Population type: farmed
Production system: semi-closed
Affected animals
Species / Morbidity / Mortality/ Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Tilapia (_Oreochromis niloticus_ x _O. aureus_) / 6.4 percent / 6.4 percent/ 150 000 / 9600 / 9600/ 0 / 0
Affected population: Tilapia

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: The owner of a tilapia farm in Taoyuan City found abnormal mortality (approximately 6.4 percent) in his farmed tilapia since [1 Jun 2017], and then reported the event to the Local Disease Control Center on [6 Jun 2017]. Samples from tilapia with dermal and ocular lesions were collected and sent to the National Laboratory (Animal Health Research Institute) for diagnosis. On [12 Jun 2017], RT-PCR results showed positive reaction to nucleic acid of Tilapia Lake Virus (TiLV) in those samples. Preliminary genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the genomic sequence of segment 3 gene showed the virus shared 93 percent and 92 percent identity with the strains found in Israel in 2014 and Thailand in 2016, respectively. Movement restriction of the index farm has been carried out after the confirmation of TiLV infection. Epidemiological investigation and surveillance of surrounding tilapia farms are being conducted.

Control measures
Measures applied: disinfection / disinfestations, screening, traceability, quarantine, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Animal Health Research Institute (National laboratory)/ Tilapia (_Oreochromis niloticus_ x _O. aureus_) / reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 12 Jun 2017 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The following comment by Mod.AS, recently published in posting 20170605.5084485, is applicable here:

"OIE's disease card on the emerging 'Tilapia lake virus" (TiLV) is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Internationa_Standard_Setting/docs/pdf/Aquatic_Commission/A_TiLV_disease_card.pdf.

Article 4 in the said card addresses the geographic distribution as follows (references excluded):
"TiLV has been reported in Colombia, Ecuador, and Israel and most recently, Egypt and Thailand. However, a lack of thorough investigation of all mortality incidents means that the geographic distribution of TiLV may be wider than currently [reported]. For example, reports of mortality in tilapia in Ghana and Zambia in 2016 have not been attributed to TiLV but the available information does not indicate that the presence of the virus has been investigated. A partial genome from Thailand showed relatively high variation to strains from Israel (around 97 percent nucleotide identity)."

On 26 May 2017, the FAO published an exhaustive special global alert (no. 338) addressing Tilapia lake virus; the document (6 pages) is available at http://www.fao.org/3/a-i7326e.pdf". - Mod.CRD
