About 300 residents of Kampung Sungai Nipah in Bukit Pelandok here have
moved out of their homes since Sunday following an outbreak of a disease,
suspected to be Japanese encephalitis [JE, which has so far claimed six
lives.
Three vernacular [? schools, SRJK(C) Sungai Nipah, Chua and Bukit
Pelandok, were closed by the school authorities when pupils failed to
turn-up yesterday. Commercial centres at Kampung Sungai Nipah and Bukit
Pelandok towns were also closed and only a handful of people were seen
moving about in the area.
A resident said her husband, 40 years old, who owns a pig farm, had been
admitted to a hospital in Kuala Lumpur with a "peculiar" illness and
complaints of headache, loss of appetite and high temperature. "His
condition is serious.", she said. Her brother-in-law 49 years old,
succumbed to the disease the same day," she said. She also said that she
is unsure whether the outbreak was due to JE as other animals, such as cats
and dogs, were also affected, adding her neighbours had moved in with
relatives in other places.
A 35-yer-old pig farm owner said animals including pigs died after coughing
blood and breeders were afraid to enter their farms. "At first we assumed
it was a normal viral infection. Now we have no alternative but to kill our
pigs if the situation worsens," one of the owner said.
State Executive Councillor and Lukut Assemblyman Datuk Dr Yeow Chai Thiam
said five people died so far--all pig-breeders and farm workers from Sungai
Nipah and Bukit Pelandok. He said 19 others from the nearby areas were
admitted over the last two weeks at hospitals in Kuala Lumpur, Seremban and
Port Dickson. Dr Yeow said a 60-year-old former village headman at another
pig-rearing area in Kampung Wong Seng Chow also succumbed to the disease on
Sunday. "Preliminary investigation revealed that the outbreak is suspected
to be encephalitis. We are not taking chances and the authorities are
conducting further tests by taking blood samples from pigs at affected
farms."
Dr Yeow said 3,500 pigs at four pig farms in the area would be killed by
today to contain the disease, adding that another 20,000, mostly piglets,
would be killed in two weeks with the supervision of the State Veterinary
Department. "We have also advised residents, particularly breeders to
obtain their third JE vaccinations immediately from nearby Government
clinics," he added.

Pork consumption in Malaysia has fallen between 30 and 40 percent since the
outbreak of a deadly virus carried by pigs, prompting authorities to
reassure consumers that the meat is safe. "The pork itself is not the
issue or the disease because it is safe to be eaten," Veterinary Services
director-general Mohd Nordin Mohd Nor was quoted by the official Bernama
news agency as saying late on Thursday. "The pig issue and the pork issue
are two different issues."
Authorities say 28 people are believed to have died after contracting JE
virus, which is transmitted from infected pigs to humans by _Culex_ sp.
mosquitoes. There have been 52 suspected cases of JE in two states in
Peninsular Malaysia since October. Only 13 of the 52 cases have been
confirmed by laboratory tests to be instances of JE, and four of the deaths
have been officially attributed to the virus.
The cabinet on Wednesday ordered authorities to vaccinate the estimated 2.4
million pigs in the country, and hundreds have been slaughtered. Nordin
said demand for pork had dropped between 30 and 40 percent since the
outbreak of the virus, and he appealed to consumers not to panic. He said
the department had slaughtered about 500 pigs in the central state of
Negri Sembilan as a last resort as the animals had been abandoned by their
owners. "It is not the department taking the pigs and destroying them. We
are not even in favour of destroying the pigs in the first place. We find
ways to handle it in a humane way," he said. Nordin said that before all
of the pigs could be vaccinated, it would have to be determined who would
bear the overall cost estimated at 33 million ringgit ($8.7 million). He
said his department currently had 30,000 doses of the vaccine, which is
manufactured in Taiwan, and 300,000 more doses would be available in seven
to 10 days.

[It is still confusing to me as to exactly how many case-fatalities have
been attributed to JE virus infection and how many of these have been
laboratory-confirmed. Killing large numbers of pigs sounds heroic at best.
