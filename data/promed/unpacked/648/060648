With reference to ProMED post "Undiagnosed illness, camel - Kenya: (MB) RFI" published on 10 Jun 2020, we would like to report that EpiCore has opened a request for information on the same topic (RFI 1330: https://epicore.org/#/events2/1330). Please find below EpiCore surveillance project contribution:

This outbreak has been ongoing for about a month now in 4 counties in Kenya (Mandera, Garissa, Wajir, and Marsabit), and there are reports of similar cases in Ethiopia. It is reported to be spreading rapidly and has an estimated case fatality rate of about 2% and a herd attack rate of about 50%. So far, more than 100 cases have been reported with about 60 cases confirmed.

Symptomatology: 2 forms - respiratory type and nervous type
Respiratory: mucopurulent discharge from both nostrils, lacrimation, difficulty breathing, neck rigidity and edema, mostly affecting the young
Nervous: uncoordinated movements, lacrimation, fever, swollen hind legs, affecting all ages
Lab work so far: mixed picture. Some results include trypanosomiasis, _Moraxella_, _Clostridium_ spp.; many samples MERS IgG reactive. A number of animals responding to tetracycline and dexamethasone. Further detailed lab work underway. Communities advised to avoid close contact.
