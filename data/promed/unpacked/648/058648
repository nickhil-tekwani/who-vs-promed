Pig and chicken Deaths west Timor
---------------------------------
My information from the head of animal health for NTT [Nusa Tenggara
Timur](via SMS) is that the chickens died from Newcastle disease.
Pig deaths, presumably Classical swine fever, happened months ago and
were not reported in a timely manner, nor specimens collected. This
is the usual situation here -- bury the animal through the hole in
the man -- and then report.
I have been working in Eastern Indonesia and now Timor-Leste for
nearly 7 years in total -- and the above is a common situation.
Must have been a slow news day and/or the locals are trying to get
something from the government.
On my trip out from Dili this week we heard of many deaths in
cattle/buffalo (unvaccinated for Hemorrhagic septicaemia) that were
reported to have taken place months ago -- however no reports of
these mortalities were received here in Dili.

[Stephen Dunn is gratefully acknowledged for this first-hand
information from West Timor. Unfortunately, the harsh conditions
described by him are not unique to Timor. Similar contributions from
correspondents in such parts of the world are essential in obtaining
information on outbreaks of known, emerging or new diseases.
Hemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) is an acute pasteurellosis, caused by
particular serotypes of _Pasteurella multocida_ and manifested by an
acute and highly fatal septicaemia principally in cattle and water
buffalo; the latter are thought to be more susceptible than cattle.
It is a major disease of cattle and water buffalo in Asia, Africa,
and some countries of southern Europe and the Middle East. The worst
epidemics occur during the rainy season. HS is most common in the
river valleys and deltas of southeast Asia among buffalo used in rice
cultivation.
The HS serotypes of _P. multocida_ have not been recovered from human
infections.
The principal means of prevention is vaccination. For further
