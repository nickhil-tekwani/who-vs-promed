I agree with the notion that there is a hesitation about using mefloquine
routinely.
However, it is also important to remember that at least in India, at
Baroda, where I practice as a consultant Physician in Internal Medicine,
the number of persons with malaria is high but the proportion of vivax
malaria at any point of time is higher than that of falciparum.
It is only in less than 10-15% that the organisms are resistant to
chloroquine, and for them mefloquine is very useful. If all patients have
had mefloquine to start with during travel we would have a little less in
reserve. We do see a lot of falciparum with
hemolysis, acute tubular obstruction, renal failure and also cerebellar
involvement and cerebral infection.
