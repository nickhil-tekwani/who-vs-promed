Ukraine was struggling to control the COVID-19 pandemic even before Russian troops advanced on the country. It was slower to launch its COVID-19 vaccination campaigns than other European countries, and while the government encouraged citizens to get immunized, most people struggled to find a way to get the shot, didn't feel the need to get vaccinated, or didn't trust the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.

Just before the invasion on 24 Feb 2022, only 35% of the Ukrainian population had been vaccinated. That puts it in line with most of its neighboring countries, although some, including Poland and Hungary, have achieved higher vaccination coverage. While different health systems and varying attitudes about vaccination in those countries are contributing to those contrasting rates, Ukraine's relatively low vaccination rate could have implications for how large additional surges of cases, both in the country and in the region become as a result of the war. Like many other countries, Ukraine experienced a surge in cases due to the omicron variant in November [2021] and another peak in the 1st week of February [2022] -- most likely due to its low level of vaccination. By the middle of February, 60% of COVID-19 tests conducted in the country were positive.

Such low vaccine coverage isn't enough to control a highly transmissible virus like SARS-CoV-2, say public health experts. Add in a war -- with the political and social upheaval it causes -- and not only are spikes in infections inevitable, but there is also the potential for new variants to emerge, which puts the whole world at risk.

Vaccination and mitigation measures such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and basic hygiene are critical for curbing spread of SARS-CoV-2, but are impossible to maintain when a country is under siege. The humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders has been distributing trauma kits and training healthcare providers in Mariupol, Ukraine -- a target of the Russian attack -- as well as providing shelter and basic health needs for those crossing the border into other countries like Poland. But it's not enough.

"War is an infectious disease's best friend," says Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. "It challenges every public health program you can possibly have. It limits the medical care available for those who might be seriously ill, and often fosters transmission when so many people are crowded into bomb shelter locations and on trains. This is going to be the perfect storm of one serious challenge after another."

A decade and a half ago, World Health Organization researchers found that 65% of major infectious disease outbreaks occurring in the 1990s were among refugee populations or in conflict zones. Les Roberts, professor emeritus of Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health who has spent time in war zones addressing outbreaks, notes that these populations are especially vulnerable to viral diseases like COVID-19. "It turns out when you are under stress, your immune system does not work as well. You are not eating as well, and you cannot fight disease as well," he says. "And in times of conflict, you move around a lot, and end up in bomb shelters or basements or on trucks that are way more crowded than normal and have bad air circulation. I don't think people fully understand how war is like the breeding ground of disease."

More than 670 000 people have left Ukraine since the war began, and this increased travel will almost certainly lead to a spike in cases in the country and those bordering it -- like Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, and Moldova -- while straining their healthcare systems. Health experts are particularly concerned about the situation in Poland, where almost half of the Ukrainians have fled, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. "SARS-CoV-2 spreads like lightning right now," says Jeffrey Shaman, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. "For places like Poland and places in western Ukraine where people are fleeing, there is enormous opportunity for this virus to do damage that it wouldn't have had the opportunity to do otherwise." Prior to the influx, nearly 60% of Poland's population was vaccinated, which will help protect it against a surge, but new infections will likely spike there as well, increasing demand for healthcare services.

What's truly needed is a global coordinating body for public health, Toner says, which isn't likely, given challenges posed by issues of national sovereignty. But the principles behind global coordination might still be implemented in more limited ways.

The global vaccination distribution program COVAX, through which developed nations purchase vaccines in order to drive prices down for developing countries, represented such an effort, but is falling short of meeting its promise. It failed to deliver the 2 billion doses it had guaranteed by the end of 2021, and the group estimates that it will take until well into 2023 to provide enough vaccines to immunize the world. "After the pandemic is over, I think we need to take a real look into COVAX and why it didn't work as well as we had hoped, and what we could have done to make it better," says Toner.

Some public health experts have proposed alternatives, like supporting vaccine makers to set up manufacturing facilities in countries that have historically struggled to get the latest vaccines, as well as encouraging more shared intellectual property to enable poorer countries to access the technology they need to produce shots on their own.

[Hospitals have become targets, exacerbating care for the wounded and sick. The repercussions of this war on the spread of infectious diseases in the population of Ukraine and neighboring countries are going to be severe. But that is just one of the tragedies facing the people, whose lives are threatened and who will need to find sustenance and clean water to keep them alive. This is truly a humanitarian crisis.

Risk of severe COVID-19 from the delta and omicron variants in relation to vaccination status, sex, age and comorbidities -- surveillance results from southern Sweden, July 2021 to January 2022. Euro Surveill. 2022; 27(9): pii=2200121; https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.9.2200121
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant of concern (VOC) omicron (Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak (Pango) lineage designation B.1.1.529) was first reported in South Africa on 24 Nov 2021 and has since spread rapidly worldwide. In a comparison of secondary attack rates within Danish households, protection against infection among vaccinated persons was lower if the index case was infected with omicron rather than delta (B.1.617.2) (1 [see source URL for complete references]). Similarly, a Canadian study, using a test-negative design, found that 2 doses of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine did not protect against omicron infection, while a 3rd dose provided some immediate protection but still substantially less than against delta (2). However, available evidence suggests that COVID-19 vaccination still provides high protection against severe disease from omicron (3-5). A Danish cohort study among infected individuals found a substantially lower risk of hospitalisation after omicron infection compared with delta among both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals (4). A limitation in that study was that it included few infections in older age-groups, especially among the unvaccinated. To what extent the omicron variant leads to severe disease in unvaccinated populations, older persons and people with underlying conditions thus merits further investigation.

The aim of the present study was to monitor omicron risks in risk groups defined by sex, age and comorbidities in addition to vaccination status. The study was conducted in Scania, southern Sweden, an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse region exceeding 1.3 million inhabitants and with local variation in vaccination coverage between 40% and 90% among adults.

Discussion: We observed markedly lower risks of severe disease among the vaccinated, i.e., cases who had received at least 2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine irrespective of vaccine type, during the period when the SARS-CoV-2 omicron VOC dominated. The VE [vaccine effectiveness] thus remained high but changed in nature from protection against both infection and severe disease from delta to protection only against severe disease from omicron. The risk of severe disease was also generally lower for unvaccinated cases during the omicron period, but remained high among older people and middle-aged men with comorbidities. Omicron thus remains a genuine public health concern in countries, populations and subgroups with low vaccination uptake.

Conclusion: While the SARS-CoV-2 omicron VOC rarely leads to severe disease in vaccinated persons, first-time infection can still cause severe disease in unvaccinated persons with advanced age or underlying illnesses. Efforts to increase vaccination uptake across countries, populations and subgroups should thus remain a public health priority.

[3] Blood type, other blood proteins
Date: Thu 3 Mar 2022
Source: MedPage Today [edited]
https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/97486


Eleven blood markers, including the ABO protein that determines blood group, were implicated in severe COVID outcomes in a genomic analysis of clinical data. After examining more than 3000 blood proteins against those found in hospitalized and severe COVID cases, 6 proteins had a causal link with increased risk of hospitalization and 5 proteins were linked to COVID-related need for respiratory support, death, or both, with odds ratios ranging from 1.12 to 1.35.

Another 17 blood proteins had a causal association with reduced risk of severe COVID, reported Alish Palmos, PhD, of King's College London, and colleagues in PLoS Genetics. Palmos' group noted that this is the 1st study to examine such a large number of proteins to determine their connection to COVID severity.

"What we have done...is provide a shortlist for the next stage of research," said co-author Gerome Breen, PhD, also of King's College London, in a statement. These data "present a potentially important avenue for further research to better understand the mechanisms behind COVID-19 with an ultimate aim of developing new treatments but potentially also preventative therapies."

Specifically, they highlighted that the ABO protein was implicated in severe COVID, which suggests that blood groups play a key role in people developing severe disease. "Our study does not link precise blood group with risk of severe COVID-19, but since previous research has found that proportion of people who are group A is higher in COVID-19-positive individuals, this suggests that blood group A is a more likely candidate for follow-up studies," said co-author Christopher Hübel, PhD, also of King's College London, in a statement.

The authors noted how difficult it is to examine the role of "immunomodulatory blood proteins" without accounting for a host of clinical confounders in patients with severe COVID, such as initial viral exposure, smoking status and BMI, all of which may contribute to "high pro-inflammatory cytokine levels."

They examined data from several sources, including from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), to identify blood proteins. Palmos' team then looked at the COVID-19 Host Genome Initiative GWAS meta-analysis of individuals hospitalized due to COVID symptoms vs controls and its comparison of "very severe respiratory confirmed COVID vs the population," which examined hospitalized individuals who needed respiratory support or died from COVID vs controls. All used a European sample.

Palmos' group identified 6 blood markers that were "significantly casually associated" with COVID-related hospitalization, with an increase in odds of hospitalization ranging from 7% to 19%, the authors wrote. Notably, fatty acid hydrolase 2 (FAAH2) had the strongest association (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12-1.25).

Five proteins were linked to an increased need for respiratory support, death from COVID, or both, with an increase in odds of severe outcomes ranging from 12% to 35%. Glucosaminyl (N-Acetyl) transferase 4 (GCNT4) had the strongest association (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.26-1.44).

The authors also identified 9 proteins linked to a relative 7% to 20% decreased risk of COVID-related hospitalization. Likewise, 8 blood markers were associated with a lower risk of severe COVID, ranging from an 11% to a 27% decrease. In both instances, the strongest association was for platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1; OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.73-0.87 and OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.63-0.83, respectively).

However, they added that their analysis did not identify "typical canonical immune proteins," such as interleukin 6 or C-reactive protein, which "suggests that with a larger database of proteins, we can pinpoint non-canonical immunomodulatory proteins relevant to disease pathophysiology."

Additional limitations included the possibility of false-positive associations due to the Mendelian randomization analysis methodology used; that some blood markers were excluded due to unavailability, which would miss associations between these markers; and that other GWAS might have been better for identifying severe COVID phenotypes, although not available at the time of the study.

Author summary
--------------
"As of November 2021, more than 5 million people have died due to COVID-19. Although vaccinations provide good protection, it is important to fully understand the biology behind the severe forms of COVID-19. Mendelian randomization facilitates the identification of blood proteins that may be involved in the pathophysiology of severe forms. Here, we investigated whether >3000 blood proteins might play a role in hospitalization due to COVID-19 or the requirement of respiratory support or death due to COVID-19. Using genetic instruments and under the assumption of Mendelian randomization, our results are consistent with higher levels of 5 proteins being causally associated with an increased risk of both COVID-19 outcomes and higher levels of one protein associated with hospitalization. Our results are also consistent with higher levels of 4 proteins -- mainly playing a role in cell adhesion -- being causally associated with a decreased risk of hospitalization and respiratory support/death, and higher levels of 4 proteins being causally associated with a decreased risk of hospitalization. These proteins may represent new biomarkers useful in risk prediction of severity and may lead to new therapeutics by prioritizing druggable targets." - Mod.LK]

A global total of 8872 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 1 Mar 2022 to late 2 Mar 2022). The 7-day averages now indicate a decreasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 68 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 35 of the 68 countries are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 10 are from the Western Pacific region, 4 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 is from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 10.4%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 17.8%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 34.1% decrease in daily reported cases and a 6.3% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report registered over 1.77 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 442.42 million cumulative reported cases and over 6.00 million reported deaths. There has been a downward trend in the number of cases and deaths globally; however, transmission levels are still quite high. - Mod.UBA]
