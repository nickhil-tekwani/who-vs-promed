Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Saudi Arabia 7 Nov 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Between 27 and 30 Oct 2014, the National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia (KSA) notified WHO of 12 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 3 deaths.

Details of the cases are as follows:
The cases are from Riyadh (5), Taif (4), Hafr Albatin (1), Jouf (1), and Makkah (1). The median age of the patients is 56 years old (ranging from 30 to 90 years old). 8 cases (67 percent) are men and 8 (67 percent) are Saudi nationals. 11 cases (92 percent) suffer from 1 or more comorbidities. In the 14 days that preceded the onset of symptoms, none of the cases performed Umrah/Hajj [pilgrimage] nor travelled out of their cities of residence. Only 1 case (8 percent) has a history of contact with animals and of raw camel products consumption. 7 cases (67 percent) -- 2 of which were healthcare professionals -- came in contact with MERS-CoV patients. 2 cases (17 percent) -- including 1 healthcare worker -- spent time at hospitals with ongoing MERS-CoV outbreaks, although they had no contact with infected patients.

Tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.

The National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 3 MERS-CoV cases that were reported between 7 and 24 Oct 2014.

Globally, WHO has been notified of 909 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 331 related deaths.

[The 12 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported during the period 27 to 30 Oct 2014 mentioned above were reported previously on ProMED-mail (see references below). Additional information in the report above relates to possible high risk exposures in the healthcare environment on the part of 9 of the 12 cases (75 percent) with 7 giving a definite history of contact with suspected or confirmed cases, and an additional 2 who had been in facilities with active MERS-CoV cases, although direct contact was not identified.

With the addition of these 12 cases, the global total of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infected individuals is now at 909 including "at least" 331 related deaths (case fatality rate 36.4 percent). The most recent global tally maintained by the ECDC has reports of 929 cases including 372 deaths (case fatality rate 40.0 percent) as of 5 Nov 2014 (http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/press/news/_layouts/forms/News_DispForm.aspx?List=8db7286c-fe2d-476c-9133-18ff4cb1b568&ID=1102).

[3] Saudi Arabia (Taif): MOH outbreak control 7 Nov 2014

MOH launches MERS-CoV public information campaign in Taif 7 Nov 2014
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health has launched a new public information campaign in Taif in response to the recent spike in new cases of MERS-CoV in the region.

Medical professionals will be made available at public locations with the aim of educating citizens on the need to avoid unprotected contact with camels because of the risk of infection with MERS-CoV, underlining the crucial role of the community in preventing the spread of the disease in the Kingdom.

There have been 38 MERS-CoV cases reported in the Kingdom since [5 Sep 2014]. Nearly 1/3 of the patients reported close contact with camels before their infection.

The campaign will invite citizens to educate themselves by speaking to medical professionals and collect educational materials, which convey the need to:
- Avoid contact with camels, especially if they are sick, and their body fluids secretions.
- If you must be in contact with camels, wear a disposable mask over your mouth and nose, gloves, and a protective medical gown.
- Boil fresh camel milk, if not pasteurized.
- Cook camel meat (including liver) well before consumption.
The Ministry will have stands available at Qalb Taif Mall, Al Obaikan Mall and Taif Al Doaly until [15 Nov 2014]. Materials distributed, which can be found on the Ministry's website, also explain signs and symptoms as well as precautionary protective measures one can take.

For more information about ways to prevent MERS-CoV, please contact the (937) infectious disease hotline or visit the Ministry's website at http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/ccc/Pages/default.aspx

[4] Saudi Arabia (Riyadh): MOH outbreak control 6 Nov 2014

Ministry of Health responds to MERS-CoV cases in Riyadh 6 Nov 2014
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health continues to manage MERS-CoV cases associated with the cluster in Taif, including 5 confirmed cases in Riyadh that originated with a patient who traveled there last month [October 2014] from Taif.

Four people, including patients and healthcare workers, tested positive for MERS-CoV after coming into contact with the index patient, who was admitted on [18 Oct 2014] to Dr Sulaiman Al-Habib Hospital in Riyadh. 2 of those patients later died. One recovered and was discharged, another remains hospitalized at a MERS-CoV Center of Excellence.

The Ministry's Command & Control Center (CCC) identified the cases through its disease surveillance system and immediately dispatched a rapid-response team to assess the infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures at the hospital. In addition to conducting inspections, the Ministry identified patients and healthcare workers who had contact with the index patient for evaluation and follow up. More than 200 people, including family members and healthcare workers, were tested for the virus.

"MERS-CoV is active and we need to be on full alert," Dr Anees Sindi, Deputy Commander of the CCC, said. "Healthcare workers can reduce the risk of infection by continuing to take all the required precautions to protect themselves and their patients."

The CCC is working with the World Health Organization to investigate the Taif cluster that is associated with these cases.

"Hemodialysis patients have a compromised immune system, putting them at higher risk of developing more complications from MERS-CoV than the average patient," said Dr Abdullah Assiri, the Assistant Deputy Minister for Preventive Health and liaison to the WHO. "Hospitals should be very vigilant in monitoring these patients and isolating them when they develop any symptoms that may be attributed to an infection."

Drs Sindi and Assiri visited the hospital immediately after the 1st case was diagnosed to provide support and guidance. CCC continues to monitor the situation along with public-health and infection-control experts from the Ministry. After the CCC submitted its recommendations, the regional directorate assigned a team to the hospital to ensure that infection control practices were being followed and the recommendations were being implemented.

In partnership with the WHO and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Ministry has instituted a number of reforms designed to protect patients and healthcare workers from MERS-CoV infection. This includes fit-testing healthcare workers for masks and providing ongoing education about the guidelines for identifying and treating patients suspected of having MERS-CoV.

Whenever possible, MERS-CoV patients are transferred to a specially designated facility. Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Hospital is the Center of Excellence for the Central Region.

The Ministry has developed new policies and trained thousands of healthcare workers on how to reduce the risk of hospital-acquired infection. More than 30 research projects are underway in partnership with local and international scientists, including a critical case-control study designed to identify causes of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia.

There have been at least 796 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia since June 2012. Please visit the CCC website, http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/Pages/default.aspx, for the latest statistics and to learn more about how to reduce the risk of infection.

[The MOH press releases above are confirmation of the relationship between the outbreak in Taif and the outbreak in Riyadh. It is clear that there are extensive investigations ongoing to trace chains of transmission of the MERS-CoV within the country.

The mention that over 200 individuals were tested for MERS-CoV as part of evaluations of contacts of confirmed cases in the outbreak in Taif raises the question of whether only symptomatic cases are being reported. Previously there had been reports of asymptomatic MERS-CoV infected individuals identified through contact tracing and testing.

Since 1 Sep 2014, there have been a total of 56 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported in Saudi Arabia with 22 reported in Taif and 21 cases reported in Riyadh during this time period (since the beginning of September 2014). The mention that 1/3 of cases reported in Taif had a history of contact with camels or camel products prior to onset of illness is new -- according to the original MOH reports 11 (50 percent) of the cases in Taif had possible exposure in the health care environment (either healthcare workers or stated exposure) and only 2 of the cases were reported to have had a history of exposures to camels.

It is also of interest to learn that there are case control studies underway to identify high risk exposures for transmission of the virus. We look forward to seeing the results of these studies. - Mod.MPP
