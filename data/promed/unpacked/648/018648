----------------------------------------------------------------------
Although we have had several equine EEE cases reported by our state agriculture office, I believe the article refers to South Carolina and not Florida. Our partners at Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services do alert us to veterinary cases, which are published in the Florida Department of Health weekly Florida Arbovirus Surveillance report at http://www.doh.state.fl.us/Environment/medicine/arboviral/surveillance.htm

[ProMED-mail regrets the error contained in the original post, which located the site of EEE in Florida instead of correctly stating the location as South Carolina. We thank Dr Stanek, Bill La Via, and James H Burgess, CDM for providing clarification. - Mod.TG

South Carolina can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/8mUF. A county map can be seen at http://geology.com/county-map/south-carolina.shtml. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
