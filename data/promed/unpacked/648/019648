[PPR (peste des petits ruminants) is primarily a disease of goats and sheep. PPR virus has also been implicated, either alone or with other pathogens, in a few outbreaks in camels and water buffalo. In wildlife, PPR will cause clinical disease in many species of antelope (e.g., gazelle, impala, bushbuck, springbuck) and wild relatives of domesticated small ruminants. Goats, and particularly offspring thereof, are most susceptible. Very high mortality rates, sometimes even exceeding the 50% observed in the kids of the Susya flock, have been recorded. Such very high rates are especially seen in offspring of unvaccinated flocks and in kids, which are non-immune since they were not fed with colostrum of their vaccinated mothers.

Suseya (Susya) is an Israeli settlement within the West Bank (Palestinian Authority [PA]). The flock's veterinary care, including diagnostic and vaccination activities, is provided by the Beer Sheva District Veterinary Office of Israel's Veterinary Services and Animal Health (VSAH). Distribution map of the 6 district veterinary offices in Israel is available at https://moag.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=5b2be55bd3a3415cbf37480902d392cb.

Susya is adjacent to Palestinian villages and Bedouin encampments, which are served by the Palestinian Veterinary Services (Hebron district office).

It may be assumed that PPR is circulating within the small ruminant populations of both Israel and the PA.
