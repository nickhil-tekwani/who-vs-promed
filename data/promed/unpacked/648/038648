A South African outbreak of a multidrug resistant ''superbug'' has
been contained after it infected 9 patients of whom 3 were still in
quarantine, a hospital group said today [17 Oct 2011].

Two patients infected with the NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase
1) died but were suffering from other chronic diseases, said Joy
Cleghorn, infection prevention risk manager at Life Healthcare. "4
have been discharged and 3 remain isolated," she told AFP about the
patients at the hospital east of Johannesburg.

The NDM-1, first detected in 2009, is a gene that enables some types
of bacteria to be highly resistant to almost all antibiotics.

Only 2 other cases have been recently reported in South Africa.
"Around the same period, one month ago, there has been an outbreak in
a public hospital of Johannesburg," said Cleghorn. The patients at the
private Life Glynnwood Hospital, in Benoni east of Johannesburg, had
not travelled to India and the illness was "a secondary contact," she
said.

The 1st African infections were reported in Kenya and they have also
been found around the world including in Australia, Britain, Japan,
and the United States.

[NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1) is a carbapenemase, which
is a beta-lactamase that degrades and thereby confers resistance to
carbapenem antibiotics. Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam
antibiotics that includes imipenem and meropenem. These carbapenems
historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many
infections due to carbapenem-sensitive multidrug-resistant Gram
negative bacilli.

The carbapenemases fall into several molecular classes, A, C, B, and
D. Classes A, C, and D have serine at the active site and class B,
zinc at the active site. KPC (_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemase)
are class A carbapenemases; IMP (imipenemase), NDM-1, and VIM (Verona
integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase) are class B carbapenemases;
and OXA-types (oxacillin-hydrolyzing) are class D carbapenemases.

NDM-1 confers resistance to carbapenems, as well as resistance to all
other beta-lactam antibiotics, except aztreonam (a monobactam).
Nevertheless, isolates that produce NDM-1 are commonly resistant to
aztreonam, presumably by a different mechanism. The gene that encodes
NDM-1 also can co-exist with genes that determine resistance to other
classes of antibiotics, including the fluoroquinolones and
aminoglycosides. Colistin and tigecycline may retain activity against
NDM-1-producing bacteria, but these antibiotics either have
significant side effects, are potentially inferior to more
conventional therapies, or can be costly.

_Enterobacteriaceae_ that produce NDM-1 have been reported from the
UK, the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, Sweden, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Taiwan, China, Israel, and now South Africa. Many
patients who are either infected or colonized with bacteria that
produce NDM-1 had initially gone abroad to India and Pakistan for
treatments such as cosmetic surgery, and carried these organisms back
to their home countries. Once these patients were hospitalized in
their home countries, NDM-1-producing bacteria could then spread
locally to other hospitalized patients.

Community spread of these fecal organisms is facilitated in developing
countries by unsanitary disposal of human excrement, fecal
contamination of the drinking water supply, coupled with heavy and
unregulated antibiotic use. Indeed, NDM-1 has been found in the
drinking water and sewage in New Delhi (Walsh TR, Weeks J, Livermore
DM, Toleman MA: Dissemination of NDM-1 positive bacteria in the New
Delhi environment and its implications for human health: an
environmental point prevalence study. The Lancet Infectious Diseases,
2011; 11(5): 355-62; available at
http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2811%2970059-7/abstract).

The gene encoding NDM-1 is located on mobile genetic elements, which
facilitates their spread between bacteria of the same or even
different species. Consequently, NDM-1 is not only found in
_Enterobacteriaceae_ such as _K. pneumoniae_ and _Escherichia coli_,
NDM-1 has been found in other Gram negative bacilli such as
_Acinetobacter_. (See ProMED-mail NDM-1 carrying Enterobacteriaceae -
worldwide ex India, Pakistan (02) 20100914.3325.) However, the
bacterial species involved in the South African NDM-1 outbreak is not
stated in the news release above.

Infection control interventions in healthcare facilities aimed at
preventing transmission of carbapenemase-producing isolates include
recognition of carbapenem-resistant _Enterobacteriaceae_ when cultured
from clinical specimens, placement of patients colonized or infected
with these isolates on contact precautions, and in some circumstances,
conducting point prevalence surveys or active-surveillance testing
among high-risk patients (CDC: Guidance for control of infections with
carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing _Enterobacteriaceae_
in acute care facilities. MMWR 2009; 58(10): 256-60; available at
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5810a4.htm).

Johannesburg, the largest city in South Africa, with a population of
almost 4 million, is the provincial capital of Gauteng
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg). For a map of Gauteng
