Medan Veterinary Center said that the death of thousands of pigs, besides being caused by the hog cholera [Classical Swine Fever) virus, were also found to be infected with the African Swine Fever (ASF) virus.

The Head of the Medan Veterinary Center, Agustia, said on [Thu 7 Nov 2019], that their team collected, during September-October 2019, samples from pigs in several districts which reported increased swine deaths. Initially, hog cholera, a disease was behind an outbreak in 1993-1996, was suspected. When cases continued to occur [in spite of vaccination?], laboratory tests were repeated leading to indication of ASF.

Agustia explained that to prove the existence of ASF, lab tests had to be repeated many times and the results were delivered by her supervisor. He said he reported the results of the lab test to the Director General of Animal Disease and Health of the Ministry of Agriculture. This ASF virus has never existed in Indonesia.

The attack is fast and systemic. The pig that is attacked does not look sick but can suddenly die. ASF is not zoonotic, namely not transmitted to humans, but readily transmit from pig to pig.

Agustia indicated the need to follow ASF control requirements. First, the community should not buy cheap pigs. Second, the community must apply bio-security, pig holders avoiding going to look at each other's sick animals. Third, pig carcasses should not be thrown into rivers or into forests, but buried. Fourth, it is necessary to tighten the control upon livestock traffic and maintain stable sanitation. Cages should be washed as often as possible.

As reported previously, the Head of the North Sumatra Food and Animal Security Service, Azhar Harahap, said that the hog cholera virus had already been endemic in 11 districts and killed 4682 pigs. He also strongly suspected that the death of pigs observed floating in the Bederah River or Siombak Lake was caused by hog cholera. "But the disease cannot be guessed. Tests must be done in a laboratory," concluded Azhar.

[A Reuters report dated 6 Nov 2019, submitted to ProMED-Mail, informed that "Indonesia swine fever outbreak kills more than 4000 pigs in Indonesia's province North Sumatra"; the term African swine fever was not used in that report (see https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-swinefever/indonesia-swine-fever-outbreak-kills-more-than-4000-pigs-idUSKBN1XG1NS).

No report in English, indicating the identification or suspicion of ASF in Indonesia, has been published so far (Thu 7 Nov 2019, GMT 18:40).

At this time, the only reports indicating ASF in Indonesia have been published in Indonesian; they, likely, reflect the factual situation, in particular since ASF has already been reported from the adjacent territories of the Philippines (Luzon) and from East Timor. Official confirmation and OIE immediate notification of ASF virus circulating in Indonesia are pending.
