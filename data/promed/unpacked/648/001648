According to the final report from the Southern Nevada Health District, 4 employees of the [Firefly] restaurant and 290 patrons were sickened by salmonellosis between 21 and 26 Apr 2013. The restaurant was closed 3 days later after officials began receiving reports of the illness.

The report showed that health officials tested 21 food items at the restaurant as part of the investigation. Only the cooked chorizo, a type of [pork] sausage, tested positive for the strain of salmonella believed to be responsible for the outbreak.

"It is likely that the outbreak was due to local cross-contamination in the restaurant's kitchen and not from a contaminated commercial food," officials said in the report.
