Encephalitis outbreak worsens in south west Michigan
----------------------------------------------------
The reported outbreak of eastern equine encephalitis is growing, reports
the Kalamazoo Gazette. The disease, called EEE for short, is a virus spread
by mosquitoes. While the disease has killed at least 67 horses -- the worst
outbreak in 30 years -- there has only been one suspected case in a person.
That case was a Kalamazoo county man, but a final determination of the
cause still has not been reported by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.

Meanwhile, the disease continues spreading across south west Michigan. The
Gazette reports the disease appears to be centered in Barry county;
however, cases have been reported in Cass, St Joseph, Calhoun, and
Kalamazoo counties. Veterinarians say there is a vaccine available for
horses. And as a result of the reporting of the disease outbreak, those
doctors say they have seen an increase in calls about the vaccine.
Officials recommend that horses in the so-called red zone -- the area with
the most suspected cases -- should re-vaccinate or vaccinate their horses
immediately.

There is no vaccine for people, so officials recommend people in the
affected areas use insect repellent, long sleeve pants and shirts, and
avoid being out at dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active. Most
people infected with EEE will experience no symptoms. But CDC reports that
some will develop "sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and
vomiting. The illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures, or
coma." The disease has a 33 per cent mortality rate, CDC reports.

[This article does not state clearly that all of the above mentioned 67
horses are in Michigan. However, Michigan Emerging Disease web page
<http://www.michigan.gov/emergingdiseases> provides a map of the affected
counties and shows that as well as some confirmed cases, many more are
presumed to died of EEE without laboratory confirmation.

The disease is carried by mosquitoes, and warm weather and a few showers
spell excellent conditions for mosquito breeding and a risk of the disease.
Just because horses are located in the north, the south, the east or the
west of the country is no reason to believe that the disease cannot be in
your area.

Protection from EEE is available in a vaccine, often combined with West
Nile virus. However the antibody protection afforded by the EEE vaccine
wanes quickly and should be repeated frequently, at least twice a year and
often as many as 3 times a year. It is cheap insurance for your horse.

It is also advisable to protect yourself, as the article above indicates. -
