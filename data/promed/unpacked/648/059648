Occurrence of the Root-Knot Nematode _Meloidogyne hapla_ in the
Czech Republic.
M. Zouhar, P. Rysanek, and B. Tesarova, Department of Plant
Protection, Czech University of Agriculture, 165 21 Prague, Czech
Republic. Plant Dis. 87:98, 2003; published on-line as D-2002-1107-
02N, 2002. Accepted for publication 15 Oct 2002.

_Meloidogyne hapla_ [Mh] was detected in several commercial
vegetable fields in the Province of Central Bohemia in the Czech
Republic. Crops grown in the area of infestation include leek, onion,
cauliflower, early potatoes, and carrot.
During the past 2 to 3 years, growers have observed the typical
stunting and formation of root galls on carrot roots. Identification of
the causal organism was based on microscopic observation of the
perineal patterns of females [nematodes] obtained from root galls
and by PCR (1,2). Mh was identified in galled roots using both
methods.
As controls, known species of _Meloidogyne_ (_chitwoodi_,
_arenaria_, _javanica_, _incognita_, and _fallax_) were obtained
from M. Phillips (SCRI, Dundee) and C. Zijlstra (PRI, Wageningen);
Mh was furnished by M. Liskova (PI, Kosice).
Several carrot fields were inspected in the area during in 2000 and
2001. In most fields, only isolated and limited outbreaks occurred,
but recently, we observed a widespread and fairly homogeneous
occurrence of root knot attributed to Mh in a 2-ha field. This
nematode may become a more widespread and damaging pest,
especially of carrot, in the Czech Republic.
Other than carrot, no visible symptoms induced by Mh were
observed on vegetable crops in heavily infested soils in the area
following testing in the greenhouse and the field. Therefore,
exclusion of carrot cultivation or a longer crop rotation is
recommended to minimize economic losses to growers.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the occurrence of Mh in
the Czech Republic.

[Plant parasitic nematodes cause significant damage to horticultural
crops worldwide. Root knot nematodes are particularly damaging,
causing about 75 percent of the damage on roots of warm-season
crops. Feeding on roots results in root distortion, which often
provides routes for infection by fungal and bacterial pathogens.
Some nematodes (ectoparasitic) feed on root surfaces, and others
(endoparasitic) migrate into root tissues and feed on specific cells,
where they complete their life cycles. Species in the
_Cucurbitaceae_ (squash and cucumber family) are particularly
susceptible to nematode damage.
