2001/090 _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _michiganensis_ occurs in Algeria

Tomato is an important and expanding crop in Algeria. 2 surveys were
carried out independently in 1988/89 and ..1997/98 on the possible presence
of bacterial canker (_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _michiganensis_
[Cmm - EPPO A2 quarantine pest) on tomato crops in the coastal region near
Alger and in the Mitidja plain. Tomatoes grown in the field, under plastic
tunnels, and in nurseries were visually inspected, and diseased samples
were tested in the laboratory for the presence of Cmm. ... In 1988/89, [650
ha grown by 85 growers were inspected and bacterial canker was observed in
13 production units. In 1997/98, [400 ha grown by 46 growers were
inspected and 4 production units were infected. [The mean infection levels
for the 2 surveys were 15.3% and 9.3%, respectively. All isolated strains
were identified as Cmm.
The [status of ... Cmm in Algeria is ... Present: found in the coastal
region near Alger and in the Mitidja plain.
According to the EPPO Secretariat, this is the first report of Cmm in Algeria.

[Cmm affects field and greenhouse production systems, often inducing
severe, in some cases, total crop loss. Tomato and pepper are major hosts.
The primary source of the pathogen is contaminated seeds and transplants.
The pathogen can survive in non-decomposed tomato crop residues and on seed
for up to 5 years. Solanaceous weeds can be alternate hosts of the
pathogen. Infested seed is the principal means of long-distance spread.
Disease management involves the use of disease-free seed, planting
resistant cultivars, and enforcement of vigilant phytosanitary procedures
(decontamination of supporting stakes and equipment in greenhouse
production systems and rotation of the crop in field conditions). Some
degree of control can be obtained using chemical sprays.
