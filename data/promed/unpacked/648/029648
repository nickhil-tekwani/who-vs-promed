US FDA warns of lead in some Mexican candy
------------------------------------------
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned on Friday against letting
children eat certain imported Mexican candies because of lead
contamination. An FDA statement said candies containing chili powder and
tamarind were at risk for lead contamination.
Examples of chili-containing products included lollipops coated with chili
and powdery mixtures of salt, lemon flavor, and chili seasoning, sold as a
snack item. The FDA said candies containing the tamarind fruit, a popular
Mexican item, could become contaminated with lead if sold in poorly made
glazed ceramic vessels that release lead. It said that "it would be prudent
to not allow children to eat these products at this time."
Lead can cause permanent brain damage to infants and children and harm
adults who ingest high levels of it. The FDA said it would be working with
the Mexican government and industry to resolve the problem. It also sent a
letter to manufacturers, importers, and distributors of imported candy
warning of plans to step up regulatory action over lead contamination.
