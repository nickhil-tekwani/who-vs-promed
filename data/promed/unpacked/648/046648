African swine fever (ASF) has been detected as the reason behind the death of over 100 pigs in the Faizullahganj area of Lucknow. Confirming this, animal husbandry department chief veterinary officer Dr Devesh Sharma said the post-mortem and viscera test reports have revealed the cause of death, and that ASF was not transferable from animals to humans.

Dr Sharma said, "The reports confirm the presence of African swine fever (ASF) virus in the dead pigs. ASF is a highly infectious haemorrhagic viral disease of pigs but does not infect or spread in humans." Sharma added that ASF affects both domestic and feral swine of all ages.

"The only way to deal with ASF was to cull all the pigs within the 1 km [0.6 mi] area. In Lucknow's case, we can't comment on what the authorities would decide, but it's a big relief that ASF cannot be transmitted from pigs to humans," the doctor added.

The diagnosis of the disease in humans, reported from Faizullahganj area synchronically with the ASF outbreak in domestic pigs (semi-feral husbandry), is pending. See the request for information [RFI] included in ProMED post 20220719.8704508. - Mod.AS
