[The HPAI H5N8 event in Japan started 4 Nov 2020; so far, 43 outbreaks in poultry and 13 in wild birds have been reported to the OIE. Their summary, epidemiological comments, and a map, last updated 28 Jan 2021 (update No. 10), are available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=36435.

HPAI strains, in particular H5N8, have been spreading throughout Eurasia, from the British Isles to Japan, since the fall of 2020, affecting backyard holdings as well as commercial poultry farms. Please refer to OIE's interactive HPAI global map, covering the period 1 Oct 2020 - 12 Feb 2021, available at https://tinyurl.com/y3tzsrug. For the Japanese and Nepal clusters, click on Japan/Nepal and zoom in to the required resolution.

Eurasia has been experiencing extreme cold weather (frost and snowfall) since the late fall months of 2020. This may have triggered winter movements of migratory birds and thereby contributed to the spread of wild-bird-transmitted diseases outside the actual migration period (Ref: Keller I, Korner-Nievergelt F, Jenni L: Within-winter movements: a common phenomenon in the common pochard _Aythya ferina_. J Ornithol. 2009; 150: 483-494; doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10336-008-0367-x; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10336-008-0367-x). - Mod.AS]
