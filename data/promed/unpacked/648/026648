The APS Publications Board and the APS Council, together with the Director
of the APS Office of Public Affairs and Education (OPAE), have given
ProMED-mail permission to post the complete text of individual Disease
Notes which report on diseases threatening food security crops in
developing-economy countries, when permission to post the Disease Note is
also given by the authors. This waiver was granted by APS in recognition
that many colleagues in developing-economy countries do not have access to
journal subscriptions or INTERNET (Disease Notes may also be found on-line
via APSnet). ProMED-mail would like to thank APS for this copyright
waiver. If Disease Note authors would like to have their complete report
posted on ProMED-mail, please contact Pamela Anderson <p.anderson@cgnet.com>
