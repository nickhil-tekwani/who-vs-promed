Over the weekend 376 persons died from cholera in Zanzibar. On Saturday,
210 confirmed cases were admitted to the largest hospital on the islands.
Following an emergency meeting on Saturday, officials announced bans on all
festive public gatherings and sales of all liquid food items, including
juices and ice cream. People are urged to boil their drinking water and to
observe the highest possible standards of hygiene and sanitation. The
reports say that most children are being kept indoors and that security has
been set up at the hospital to monitor the movement of visitors. There is a
frantic effort to obtain tetracycline and other antibiotics for use in
prophylaxis.
