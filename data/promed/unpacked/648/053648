DH keeps close watch on students' health 25 Mar 2003
The Department of Health (DH) on 25 Mar 2003 confirmed a new case of
atypical pneumonia involving a 6-year-old girl. The Consultant in-charge of
DH's Disease Prevention and Control Unit, Dr Tse Lai-yin, said the girl is
a student of City One Anglo-Chinese Kindergarten in Sha Tin. She is among
the 286 persons confirmed today to have contracted atypical pneumonia. The
girl developed symptoms on 21 Mar 2003 and was admitted to Prince of Wales
Hospital today. Her condition is stable. Dr Tse said the girl had
consulted a private doctor on 14 Mar 2003. The doctor was confirmed to have
contracted atypical pneumonia earlier.
"We are still looking for the source of infection. The health condition of
the girl's family members, classmates, and teachers are also under close
surveillance," Dr Tse said. As a precaution against atypical pneumonia,
the kindergarten and City One Nursery, both of which shared the same
premises, in consultation with DH and the Education and Manpower Bureau,
have decided to close from today to 31 Mar 2003 for disinfection and cleansing.
Dr Tse reminded teachers and parents to be cautious about the health
condition of their students and children and take every possible means to
prevent infection.
Meanwhile, the ninth floor of Metropole Hotel in Ho Man Tin has been
re-opened. The ninth floor was closed for cleansing and disinfection on 19
Mar 2003 following reports that 8 people had contracted atypical pneumonia
during their stay or visit there. The environmental condition of the hotel
is found to be satisfactory.
To enable members of the public to better understand the prevention of
atypical pneumonia, DH in conjunction with Home Affairs Department, will
conduct a series of health talks at the community halls and community
centres in Sha Tin, Happy Valley, Yau Ma Tei, Tsuen Wan, and Tai Po from 26
Mar 2003 to 3 Apr 2003 in the morning and afternoon sessions. The talks
will be conducted in Cantonese. Members of the public who wish to attend
are requested to call 2961 8673 during office hours for details and
reservation.

Update (12) on SARS cases in Singapore 25 Mar 2003
As at 25 Mar 2003, a total of 69 people with SARS have been reported to the
Ministry of Health (MOH). The 4 additional patients reported today comprise
a hospital staff and 3 close contacts of patients. All these cases are
still traced back to the index cases. 13 patients have been discharged from
hospital while the remaining 56 patients are hospitalised. All the patients
are stable except for 11 patients who are in serious condition.
With the control measures instituted so far, including implementation of
home quarantine to isolate all contacts who have been diagnosed with SARS,
the Ministry of Health would like to assure the public that there is little
risk of a community spread. We would also like to emphasize that the
disease is not infectious until symptomatic. The home quarantine measures
are additional safeguards to cut off any possible transmission to more
people. It enables contacts who may become symptomatic to be picked up
earlier and limits the exposure of other people to symptomatic contacts. It
does not mean that people under quarantine are infectious currently.
To date, there have been no additional children who have contracted SARS.
There had been reports circulating about a 2-year-old girl from the Little
Skool House who had contracted pneumonia and high fever. This is not true.
Doctors at KKH have confirmed that clinically, the girl does not have SARS.
The Ministry was notified of the death of a cancer patient at NUH who had
previously travelled to Hong Kong and who had developed pneumonia. The
death has not been classified as a death from SARS because the patient did
not have the symptoms suggestive of SARS.
Home Quarantine Measures
The Ministry would like to remind all persons served the quarantine order
to stay at home for the period indicated in the letter to them. They should
minimise contacts with other family friends or friends and to check their
temperature everyday. NEA officers will also be checking with these
contacts daily and conducting spot checks. If they develop symptoms
suggestive of the illness, they will be immediately referred to TTSH for
further evaluation and treatment if necessary. If they do not develop any
of the symptoms of SARS after 10 days, they are unlikely to contract SARS.
The public can call 1800-2254122 from 8.30am to 6.00 pm from Mon-Fri and
Sat from 8.30am to 1.30pm.
The Ministry is also asking all employers whose staff are affected by the
home quarantine measure to accept the letter from MOH to the contacts as
valid medical leave certificate from work. MOH would like to appeal to all
employers whose staff are quarantined to extend their understanding and
compassion to these people.
Tighter Screening Measures in school
The Ministry would also like to assure parents that the tighter screening
measures in school are precautionary measures. Children who have come back
from the affected countries and who have not shown any symptoms are not
infectious. This is based on the detailed analysis of all the SARS cases in
Singapore so far.
It is not necessary to close all schools as the measures that have been put
in place are adequate.
Travel advisory
The public should continue to avoid travel to Hong Kong, Hanoi, and
Guangdong province in China for the time being, unless absolutely
necessary. This would help us greatly in our efforts to contain the number
of new cases.
Concerned members of the public can call MOH hotline at tel: 1800-225-4122
during office hours.

[A] Japan From: AFX News - Asia 24 Mar 2003 17:53
2 more people in Japan have been identified as possible [cases of SARS],
the health ministry said yesterday. The latest findings bring the tally of
suspected cases of SARS in Japan to 4, health officials said.
[B] Canada From: Canada.com / CP 25 Mar 2003
<http://www.canada.com/health/story.html?id=C6B2F0C9-7FBB-40BC-AD97-EE8233A597BD>
Public health officials in Toronto moved for the first time to quarantine
people who have been in contact with a case of SARS and who are showing
some symptoms of the disease. Officials said about 25 people who appear
symptomatic, and their close family contacts have been ordered to stay home
for a period of 10 days. That is believed to be the outside limit of the
infectious period of the disease. Health Minister Tony Clement announced
that Ontario had moved to make SARS a reportable disease Tuesday, giving
public health officials the power to order people to remain in quarantine
if necessary.
The number of probable cases of SARS in the province jumped to 18 from 10,
with 5 people remaining as suspect cases. Elsewhere in Canada, there is a
probable case in Vancouver and 2 suspected cases in Alberta. 3 people have
died.
The new cases are in health-care workers from Scarborough Grace Hospital,
where a patient who later died of SARS was treated in mid-March 2003. A man
who shared an emergency department room with him also contracted the
disease and died last Friday. The health-care workers -- who include
nurses, doctors, technicians, and paramedics -- treated the man before
worldwide attention was drawn to the fact that a mysterious, contagious,
and potentially fatal disease had spread from Southeast Asia. As such,
they were not taking the high level of care -- using special masks, gowns,
and treating patients in isolation -- that is now being used for SARS
cases. To date none of the staff in other Toronto hospitals caring for
SARS patients have shown signs of the disease. "We are taking steps to
contain the spread of SARS and to make sure people who have been exposed
are safely isolated where they are cared for," said Dr. Colin d'Cunha,
chief medical officer for Ontario.

[In today's update there is an increase of 31 new cases reported to the WHO
since yesterday's report, of which the majority have occurred in Hong
Kong. Of note is that in yesterday's update, Spain was listed as having a
probable case, whereas Spain is not on today's update as having a probable
case. This is being mentioned to further highlight the state of flux of
these reports, due to the absence of a definitive diagnostic test to
confirm that these cases of respiratory illness are in fact due to
SARS. We are trying to present the most up-to-date and accurate case
counts and information on disease transmission, geographic areas with cases
identified, and geographic areas where secondary transmission has occurred.
The newswire report on the suspected cases among health care professionals
in Ontario, Canada has not been confirmed as yet on the Health Canada
website; hence this information is likely to change. Of note is that the
Ontario Provincial Department of Health has implemented a quarantine on the
suspected cases and their close contacts. The newswire report on 4
suspected cases in Japan is not reflected in the WHO reports, and suggests
that they do not meet the criteria to be classified as probable
cases. (see WHO case definitions
