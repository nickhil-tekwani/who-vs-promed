The United Nations has sent experts to the western Afghan city of Herat to
investigate a mysterious disease that has killed dozens, a U.N. official
said on Tuesday.
He said doctors from the World Health Organisation, environmentalists and
agricultural experts have gone to Gulran district of Herat where 32 people,
mainly children, have perished over the last few months.
Tests on 11,000 people in 11 villages showed that 130 have developed the
disease, which has not yet been thoroughly identified but seems to be a
form of liver cirrhosis, the official said.
First reports say the disease is caused by a poisonous plant, chalmac,
which grows in wheat farms and which killed 50 people in Herat last year
and is said to have claimed hundreds of lives two decades ago.
Gulran district is an isolated region in a desert close to the border with
Turkmenistan.
