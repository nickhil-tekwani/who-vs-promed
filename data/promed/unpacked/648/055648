[1] Case update
- Sat 11 Aug 2018. Epidemiological situation. DRC Ministry of Health [in French, machine trans., edited]
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=08400e795f

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated Fri 10 Aug 2018:
- A total of 49 cases of haemorrhagic fever have been reported in the region, with 22 confirmed and 27 probable;
- 53 suspected cases are under investigation;
- 1 new confirmed case in Mabalako.
Erratum of the bulletin of Fri 10 Aug 2018: one death of a confirmed case in Beni, and 0 deaths in Mabalako.

News of the response
- WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom visited teams in Mangina, the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak. In Mangina, he visited the temporary Ebola Treatment Center (ETC), where the providers explained their work. He also noted the progress of the installation of the Ebola treatment center, which will be co-managed by the Ministry of Health and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). The ETC of Mangina and that of Beni, co-managed with Alima, will be functional before the end of next week [week of 13 Aug 2018]. Then, the director-general of WHO visited one of the 2 housing sites selected to host national and international health workers deployed in Mangina as part of the response.
- The Ministry of Health, through its World Bank-funded Health System Development Project (HSDP), has finalized practical arrangements to start free healthcare in 3 health zones around the epicenter, namely Mabalako, Blessed, and Oicha. In times of epidemic, it is important that the financial barrier does not hinder access to healthcare. This measure to introduce free healthcare in the affected areas aims to encourage the population to go to an approved health center as soon as the 1st symptoms appear, increasing their chances of survival.
- The process of temporary discharge of the 74 staff members of the Mangina Reference Health Center (CSR) considered as contacts is also complete. All those who have been in contact with confirmed cases will be followed up for 21 days and cannot return to CSR until one month later. During this period, they were asked to avoid any movement outside the area. They will be temporarily replaced by interim health staff from other health centers in Oicha, Mabalako, and Musienene.
- 2 mobile laboratories of the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) have arrived in Goma and Mangina to accelerate the testing of samples taken across the province of North Kivu.

[Several noteworthy developments in today's official DRC MOH bulletin:
- 2 ETCs are being set up in Mangina and Beni, to be co-managed by the MOH and MSF and Alima (a healthcare NGO focused on West and Central Africa), respectively;
- local housing for incoming health workers;
- free healthcare in the epicenter region, which can only help to build community trust and the social networks that undergird case finding and contact tracing;
- furlough of all the Mangina healthcare workers who had contact with the initial Ebola cases, to be monitored for the requisite 21-day incubation period, under what sounds like voluntary home or close-to-home quarantine.

Unfortunately, the MOH continues to use the umbrella term of "haemorrhagic fever" to refer to confirmed and suspect Ebola cases. For reasons we have previously discussed (see Ebola update (18) part [2], 27 May 2018 20180527.5821927), this term can be misleading because hemorrhagic manifestations are not a common feature of Ebola infection, hence the change in WHO terminology from Ebola hemorrhagic fever to Ebola virus disease. - Mod.LXL]

[2] Ebola vaccines
Fri 10 Aug 2018 - Experts highlight Ebola vaccine progress and suggest next steps - NIH
[US NIAID press release, edited]
https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/experts-highlight-ebola-vaccine-progress-and-suggest-next-steps

Despite promising advances, important scientific questions remain unanswered in the effort to develop a safe and effective Ebola vaccine, according to members of an international Ebola research consortium. In a viewpoint published in the Lancet, the experts review the current field of Ebola vaccine candidates and clinical trials and highlight key gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed by future research.

Researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, are among the viewpoint's authors. All authors are with the Partnership for Research on Ebola VACcination (PREVAC). In addition to NIAID, the partnership, established in 2017, comprises experts from the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm), the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), the West African Clinical Research Consortium, and their collaborators. PREVAC is currently conducting a phase-2 clinical trial in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Mali to evaluate 3 Ebola vaccination strategies in people one year and older.

Ebola virus disease remains a public health threat -- the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) already has experienced 2 Ebola outbreaks in 2018 -- underscoring the need for continued efforts to develop an effective vaccine. The authors note that 36 trials of Ebola vaccine candidates have been completed, and another 14 are active, according to clinicaltrials.gov. The rVSV-ZEBOV experimental vaccine, which has been deployed in the DRC, is the only candidate with some clinical efficacy data, which were obtained in a clinical trial in Guinea conducted during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in Guinea.

After reviewing the status of 4 additional vaccine candidates under study (Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo, chAd3-EBO-Z, and the GamEvac-Combi vaccine), the authors highlight areas where more research is required. Specifically, they note the need for more data in pregnant women, children, and immunocompromised populations, including people infected with HIV and the elderly. Additionally, they say more research is needed on the durability and rapidity of immune responses generated by various vaccine approaches. The experts also call for studies to identify reliable correlates of protection (the specific and measurable part of an immune response that would indicate a person is protected from Ebola) as well as large-scale trials to fully evaluate the safety and efficacy of experimental vaccines.

The authors conclude by underscoring the value of embedding social science research in clinical-trial design to help build trust and engagement with the affected communities. They note that in addition to the need to investigate various vaccines and vaccination strategies to respond more effectively to future outbreaks, improving the global capacity to conduct clinical research and forming collaborative partnerships, such as PREVAC, are crucial for success.

[The primary article can be downloaded at https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31710-0/fulltext and is well worth reading in its entirety. Its focus is on traditional parameters of pharmaceutical vaccine development, including rate and durability of antibody response and adverse events. Interestingly, although antibody response to the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine was not universal, the fact remains that no one who was ring-vaccinated with the rVSV-ZEBOV in West Africa or the recent DRC-Bikoro outbreak has thus far developed clinical Ebola infection. This practical field success may make it difficult to perform controlled clinical trials in the current DRC North Kivu outbreak, since patients would understandably prefer to receive the perceived "tried-and-true" rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine. At present (and for the foreseeable future), Ebola vaccines are being deployed in high-risk individuals in active outbreaks in low-resource countries. Under such circumstances, practical considerations outweigh other factors: short-term antibody response (more than durability or minor adverse reactions), the speed and scale of vaccine production, whether a -80 deg C/-112 deg F cold chain is required, etc. - Mod.LXL]

[3] US preparedness
Fri 10 Aug 2018 - Sustained US preparedness needed for Ebola and other pan-epidemic threats
[The Hill, edited]
http://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/401271-sustained-us-preparedness-needed-for-ebola-and-other-pan-epidemic-threats

The new Ebola virus outbreak reported Wed 1 Aug 2018 by the World Health Organization in a conflict-zone in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) near the border with Uganda and Rwanda is the 3rd Ebola outbreak in the DRC in the past 16 months and poses unique as well as urgent challenges. Armed conflict in the region will challenge efforts to trace contacts of those already infected and has led to the displacement of more than one million persons in the outbreak region as well as movement of refugees to neighboring Uganda, Tanzania, and Burundi.

Sustained American leadership and multi-sectoral coordination will be essential for responding to this outbreak and predictable future outbreaks of Ebola and other threats that can travel to this country as Ebola did in 2014.

As a volunteer with Doctors-Without-Borders [Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)] in 2014 I was fortunate to have the opportunity to provide hands-on care for more than 200 patients in Liberia. The lessons that crisis offered were tragic in their nature and scope and unforgettable, yet illustrated that we have forgotten all too often the lessons that history has taught us.

Because of what I saw in West Africa, in August 2014 I proposed an exhibition on epidemics to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. That exhibit opened [Fri 18 May 2018] and has an online-accessible version translated into 5 languages.

A major goal of this 3-year exhibition is to help educate the general public in the USA and abroad about working together to help prevent, detect, and respond to epidemics that include Ebola, influenza, Zika, HIV/AIDS, and more, from the integrated triad view of "One Health" (that is, human, animal, and eco health).

The exhibit highlights a reality that the current outbreak in North Kivu illustrates once again: outbreaks of pandemic potential comprise a major part of humanity's history and are not about to go away on their own. In fact, as the current outbreak shows us, some of the factors that lead to the wide spread of infectious agents that have jumped from animals to humans are only increasing. This means our efforts, and our focus, must increase as well.

We have made significant progress. Improved disease surveillance and laboratory capacities, developed with international support over the course of the DRC's previous 9 Ebola outbreaks, continues to enable earlier confirmation that an outbreak is occurring.

An effective vaccine against Ebola developed during the West Africa crisis was used to control the most recent previous DRC Ebola outbreak, and health officials have just confirmed that it can be used in this outbreak.

An Ebola vaccine campaign is scheduled to begin today with health workers. If sufficient armed protection and community trust can be established, then this investigational vaccine could be offered to thousands of others, including the already 1000 persons -- that include health workers -- identified as being in contact with the 43 patients having Ebola reported by WHO as of [Wed 7 Aug 2018].

From 2014 to 2015, more than 510 health workers died due to Ebola in the West African urban and rural pan-epidemic. The new vaccine offers the hope of preventing a toll of that magnitude from being repeated. In addition to the vaccine, investigational antiviral drugs and antibody treatments, some developed in the USA, are likely to be offered to patients for the 1st time in the DRC.

But the enormity of the potential challenges in the current epidemic should not be underestimated. Several laboratory-confirmed Ebola patients have been identified in the city of Beni, well-connected by road to the village of Mangina, where the initial patients were identified, according to the WHO's Dr Peter Salama.

An immediate and well-coordinated response is needed to prevent the multifocal urban outbreaks and international spread that occurred in West Africa. That is possible, in part, because of the support added to the US-initiated, international partnership of the Global Health Security Agenda, launched before the West Africa crisis and strengthened as a result. We need to remember the role that effort has played in strengthening current responses when its funding comes up for renewal in the coming year.

Similarly, the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act helped build community capacities at home to address public-health threats while supporting needed biomedical innovation. Up for reauthorization this year, its purpose remains critical, and Congress should act swiftly to ensure that it contains provisions that ensure a prepared public-health workforce and drives the development of medical countermeasures that include vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics.

American leadership in West Africa and in the USA was essential in stopping the 2013-2016 Ebola pan-epidemic, including HHS, CDC, NIH, USAID, DoD, NGOs, and multiple others. Sustaining U.S. leadership in the perpetual war against outbreaks, pan-epidemics, and truly global pandemics is essential for our own protection as well as a more secure and stable world outside our borders.
