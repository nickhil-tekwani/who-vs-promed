New World screwworm (_Cochliomyia hominivorax_) was detected and confirmed
in 2 locations in Chiapas, Mexico, on 29 Oct 2001. As of 6 Nov 2001, a
total of 18 cattle were infested.
Control measures include activities such as quarantines on the
affected/high risk farms, animal movement controls, dipping of susceptible
animals, and surveillance (including use of traps and sentinel sheep) in
the outbreak and surrounding zones. Release of sterile flies has begun in
the outbreak and perifocal zones.
The location of the outbreak is about 25 kilometers from the plant that
sterilizes screwworms used in the screwworm eradication program in Central
America. Mexico was declared free of screwworm in 1991. Since that time,
there have been multiple outbreaks, the most recent being in 1997 in
Tamaulipas (north eastern Mexico).
The American Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) will require that
animals originating from Chiapas, Mexico, and animals having passed through
Chiapas, Mexico, since 5 Oct 2001 meet US import requirements for animals
from areas affected with screwworm. Regulations exist for the importation
of horses, swine, ruminants, and dogs from countries affected with
screwworm. Since [the United States (US) does not currently import
ruminants or swine from Chiapas, Mexico, due to other animal health
concerns, the major impact of this outbreak will be on horses and dogs
being imported form Chiapas, Mexico. Requirements for horses and dogs from
areas affected with screwworm are included below:
Screwworm Requirements Implemented for Dogs From Chiapas, Mexico (9 CFR
[Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations 93.600(a)):
Dogs from any region of the world where screwworm is considered to exist
may only be imported into the US if they meet the following requirements
and all other applicable requirements of this part:
Dogs must be accompanied by a certificate signed by a full-time salaried
veterinary official of the region or origin stating the dog has been
inspected for screwworm within 5 days preceding its shipment to the US.
The certificate must state the dog is either free from screwworm or was
found to be infested with screwworm and was held in quarantine and treated
until free from screwworm prior to leaving the region of origin.
Screwworm Requirements Implemented for Horses from Chiapas, Mexico (9 CFR
93.301(j)):
Horses from any region of the world where screwworm is considered to exist
may be imported into the US only if they meet the following requirements
and all other applicable requirements of this part:
A veterinarian must treat horses with ivermectin 3 to 5 days prior to the
date of export to the US according to the recommended dose prescribed on
the product's label.
Horses must be examined for screwworm by a full-time salaried veterinary
official of the exporting country within 4 hours prior to shipment to the
US. The official must fully examine the horses, including their external
genitalia. If horses are found to be infested with screwworm, they must be
treated until free from infestation.
At the time horses are loaded onto a means of conveyance for export, a
veterinarian must treat any visible wounds on the animals with a solution
of coumaphos dust at a concentration of 5 percent active ingredient.
Horses must be accompanied to the United States by a certificate signed by
a full-time salaried veterinary official of the exporting country. The
certificate must state that the horses, including their external genitalia,
have been thoroughly examined and found free of screwworm and that the
horses have been treated as described above.
Horses must be held at the animal import center for a minimum of 7 days.
Prior to release, the horses must be examined for screwworm by an APHIS
port veterinarian. Many male horses will require tranquilization/sedation
for a detailed examination of the external genitalia. In this case, and at
the expense and risk of the owner, the port veterinarian may authorize
entry into the import center of a licensed veterinarian from Mexico or the
United States for the purpose of administering tranquilizing medication. If
screwworm are found during this examination, the horses must be held in
quarantine and treated until free of infestation.
If you have any questions, please contact the USDA, APHIS, Veterinary
Services, Emergency Programs staff at 301-734-8073, 800-940-6524, or

Screwworms are parasites capable of causing great damage to domestic
livestock and other warm-blooded animals. The larvae of this pest enter
open wounds of the host animal and feed on the raw flesh. Rare cases of
humans being infested with screwworm have been reported.
The United States has been free of screwworm since 1966 [a single screwworm
larva was identified in Texas in 1998 - see posting cited above - Mod.SH.
The US livestock industry could suffer $750 million in production losses
annually if this pest were reintroduced to the United States. This is a
serious disease and the requirements for importation must be strictly followed.
Animals are infested when the eggs hatch in the wound of an animal and the
larvae feed on the animal's flesh. Wounds that may become infested by
screwworm include those caused by feeding ticks, bites of vampire bats,
castration, dehorning, branding, shearing, wire cuts, sore mouth in sheep,
and shedding of the velvet in deer. Navels of newborn mammals are a common
site for screwworm infestation. It is very difficult to see early stages of
screwworm larvae feeding in a wound; only slight movement may be observed.
As the larvae feed, the wound is gradually enlarged, becoming wider and
deeper. Usually at this stage additional screwworm flies have deposited
eggs, resulting in multiple infestations. A bloody discharge often exudes
from the infested wounds, and a distinct odor may be detected. In some
cases, the openings in the skin may be small with extensive pockets of
screwworm larvae beneath.
Animals with screwworm infestations may die in 7 to 14 days if wounds are
not treated to kill the larvae, especially in cases of multiple
infestations. As many as 3000 larvae may be found in a single wound. Death
results from toxicity and/or secondary infection.
Infested animals usually exhibit discomfort, may go off feed, and produce
less milk. Typically, these animals also will separate themselves from the
rest of the flock or herd and seek shady or secluded areas to lie down.
A screwworm infestation is treated with topical application of approved
chemicals to kill the larvae. Wounds should be treated until the wound is
completely healed. The larvae should be removed from the wounds with tweezers.
Treating wounds and spraying or dipping animals with an approved
organophosphate insecticide will provide protection against screwworm for 7
to 10 days. However, the most effective way to control screwworm
infestation is through eradication of the screwworm. - Mod.TG
Screwworm is not usually a topic for ProMED-mail as it is an insect
infestation and not an infectious disease. We are posting this notice as an
alert because of the potential problems associated with re-introduction of
the screwworm into the US. - Mod.MPP
