With 40 000 confirmed influenza cases in Australia this early in the season [2018-19], experts this week warned that deaths in the country could hit 4000 unless infection rates slow before the winter peak, and urged the public to get a flu vaccination

The number of confirmed cases is triple the typical levels seen at this part of the flu season. In 2018, there were 58 000 recorded cases for the entire year.

Robert Booy, who heads a collective of health organisations called the Immunisation Coalition, says that this flu season has been "really strange."

2019 may be shaping up to be a particularly bad year for Australia because immunity levels are low following a mild season in 2018, Booy suggests. He adds that the presence of 2 types of flu this year [2019], rather than the usual one, is also likely to be a contributing factor.

"There has been a sustained and rising summer and autumn surge that began at the end of last year [2018] and is continuing to increase," he warns.

Members of the community at the greatest risk of dying from flu complications include the young, the elderly, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, and people with severe asthma or heart diseases, experts say. But healthy people should also get the jab, even if they don't fall into one of these categories, because they're likely to come into contact with people who are vulnerable.

High rates of vaccination are required to protect the community overall, with the hope of achieving "herd immunity," says Booy.

The University of Queensland's Kirsty Short warns that people who are obese or have diabetes are also more susceptible to severe flu and are "significantly more likely to be hospitalised with the flu, significantly more likely to be admitted to the ICU, and significantly more likely to die from the virus."

Booy recommends getting vaccinated soon for the best chance of avoiding flu altogether.

"If you get vaccinated in the month of May [2019], you can deal with the flu that's already around, [and] it will protect you for about 4 months to cover the winter flu season," he explains.

Mums-to-be should also get the jab, according to the University of Melbourne's Elizabeth McCarthy, who said it's a safer strategy for women and their unborn children than avoiding it.

William Rawlinson from the University of New South Wales in Sydney offers some tips for avoiding infection.

"Don't forget simple measures, like washing your hands, coughing into your elbow and using tissues; and there are anti-virals which are available," he says. "Finally, it's important to know what you're dealing with. If you think you have the flu, talk to your GP about diagnosis."

Experts are baffled over an unprecedented start to the flu season, with more than 10 000 people diagnosed in NSW so far this year [2019] -- almost 3 times more than the same period last year.

As NSW Health prepares for the impending peak flu season with 2.5 million vaccinations at the ready, the figures have left health authorities questioning how it will impact the state's health infrastructure.

The figures, revealed in the NSW communicable diseases report, show 10 121 recorded influenza cases to the end of April 2019.

It is almost triple last year's [2018] influenza figures for the same period (3803) and is also almost 4 times the number recorded in 2017 (2884).

2017 was a record year for the virus, with 103 852 cases reported.

"We don't know what it means because this is a new phenomenon," NSW Health communicable diseases expert Vicky Sheppard said.

"We don't know if this activity will decrease and then the influenza season will come later in the year, or, potentially, this activity could be ongoing. We've had an unusual start."

The NSW figures follow an Australia-wide trend, with influenza figures released in the 1st week in April 2019 showing Australia was nearly halfway towards its 2018 annual total.

Experts predict the flu to kill at least 4000 people this season.

Between January and March [2019], there were 7 deaths reported to NSW Health, all associated with influenza outbreaks at aged care facilities. Another 2 people died in April 2019.

"We believe that most of the influenza that we saw, particularly in January and February [2019], was introduced from overseas," Dr Sheppard said. "And we've got very similar strains to what's been circulating, particularly in Europe."

NSW Health has about 2.5 million vaccines ready to be distributed, with health workers already vaccinating 1.3 million to people across the state.

Dr Sheppard encouraged more people to get vaccinated. "If you're over 65, pregnant, a child under 5, or with a medical condition, you can get free vaccine from general practitioners now," she said. "We've not seen this before, a level of influenza activity so prolonged over the summer months. We have more sensitive testing, so we are detecting more cases, but having 27 aged care facility outbreaks is far beyond what has ever been notified before."

Robert Booy, an international flu expert and head of research at the National Centre of Immunisation Research, said the figures were worrying. "For this time of year, it's the worst in living memory," he said. "But there's always the chance it will die down in the next couple of months and we will end up with just an average season."

Professor Booy said hospitals should prepare for a high number of patients. "We need to make sure we've got resources in place in case emergency departments start getting overly busy," he said. "We need to prepare for that possibility."
