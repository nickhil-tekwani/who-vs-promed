Since November 2006, 9 cases of tularemia from 3 adjacent
municipalities in northern Norway have been laboratory-confirmed.
According to notification forms from clinicians, 8 cases had cervical
lymphadenopathy, with additional mention of oral or pharyngeal
infection in 5. Information about the clinical picture is missing for
one case at the time of submission of this report. The median age of
the cases is 22 years (range 2-54 years), and 7 are female. At the
time of notification, 2 patients had recovered, 2 were still ill, and
information was missing for the remaining 5; 4 of the cases were hospitalized.
Tularemia is endemic in Norway and is caused by _Francisella
tularensis_, which can be transmitted by rodents and hares. Large
numbers of dead rodents (lemmings, _Lemmus lemmus_) are currently
reported in the affected area after a large surge in the lemming
population last autumn [2006].
Investigation into the source of infection:
-------------------------------------------
Clinical and epidemiological information was obtained from clinical
notification forms and supplemented by information from municipal
medical officers in the affected areas. Laboratory results were
available from the laboratory notification form for each case.
Specific antibodies were detected in the serum of all cases, using a
combination of agglutination and ELlSA-technique, the latter allowing
discrimination between IgG and IgM response. Results from the
analysis of water samples were obtained by direct contact with the
laboratory. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on filter
paper samples after filtration of water and was positive for _F.
tularensis_ in samples from one of 4 tested wells.
The clinical manifestation of oropharyngeal tularaemia generally
suggests transmission by water or food (1). Because of the recent
surge in the lemming population, drinking water contaminated by
rodents was, at an early stage, suspected as the most likely source
of infection; this has also been shown to be the most frequent cause
of infection with _F. tularensis_ in Norway (2). Three of the cases
live in areas with a municipal water supply, which, after technical
inspection, was found to be an unlikely source of contaminated water.
These 3 cases were children aged 2 to 4 years who live in the same
neighborhood and who have frequently been observed eating snow.
Contaminated snow is a possible source of infection for these cases.
The remaining 6 cases all had private wells. Water from 4 of the
wells was analysed, one testing positive for _F. tularensis_ by PCR.
To our knowledge, no rodents have been tested.
Control measures:
----------------------
The public in the 3 affected municipalities have been informed by the
media about the current increased risk of tularemia. People with
private wells have been asked to inspect these for rodent carcasses
and potential rodent entrances and to take corrective measures as
required. Advice has been given regarding cleaning and disinfection
of potentially contaminated wells by shock chlorination (i.e. adding
chorine to a concentration of 30-50 mg/L for 1-2 hours) and by
boiling of water for domestic use until corrective measures have
taken effect. The public has been asked to refrain from drinking
water that has not been disinfected or boiled while involved in
outdoor activities such as hiking and camping.
Discussion:
----------
Tularaemia in Norway is caused by _F. tularensis_ subsp. holarctica,
which generally gives rise to milder disease symptoms than other
subspecies. Since 1978, the annual number of reported cases in Norway
has varied between none and 47, oropharyngeal tularemia being the
most common manifestation (2). Relatively few cases have been
associated with insect bites. This is in contrast to the situation in
Sweden and Finland, where the annual incidence generally is more than
10 times higher than in Norway, and where insect bites are considered
an important mode of transmission (3). Transmission by insects or by
skin contact with rodents generally leads to ulceroglandular
tularemia. This is characterised by an ulcer at the place of entry of
the bacteria through the skin with accompanying regional
lymphadenitis and is less common in Norway than oropharyngeal tularaemia.
Tularaemia has traditionally been called both "lemming fever" and
"hare plague," clearly indicating rodents and hares as transmitters
of disease. An increase in the incidence of tularaemia has often been
observed in years with a surge in rodent populations or in the months
thereafter. 2006 was a so called "lemming year" in the affected area,
and infected carcasses represent a potential source of infection for
humans who come into direct or indirect contact with these. Norway
has experienced several outbreaks of water-borne tularemia, the
largest in 2002 in the municipality of Midtre Gauldal in central
Norway, with 11 laboratory-confirmed cases. In the present outbreak
in northern Norway, the clinical picture of oropharyngeal tularemia
points to ingestion of contaminated water, or possibly snow, as the
most likely route of transmission. Although only one case has been
directly linked to a well that was confirmed to be contaminated by
_F. tularensis_, it is possible that water in the wells that tested
negative in the outbreak investigation had been transiently infected
weeks or months earlier. However, transmission via contaminated food
or direct or indirect contact with rodents or with cats and dogs can
not be excluded.
Many Norwegians live in or own leisure homes that have private wells
without water treatment systems. Also, the eating of snow and
drinking of water that has not been disinfected, for example from
lakes and rivers, is common practice during outdoor activities. The
risk of acquiring oropharyngeal tularaemia is particularly high in
years with a surge in rodent populations and the months thereafter,
when infected carcasses represent possible sources of infection. The
public should be advised to take appropriate action to reduce this risk.
