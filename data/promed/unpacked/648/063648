For the 1st time, scientists have found evidence of the African Ebola virus in Asian fruit bats, suggesting that the virus is far more widespread around the world than had been previously known. That does not mean that outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever are inevitable, said Kevin J Olival, leader of the bat-hunting team at EcoHealth Alliance. But the possibility exists: bats are believed to drink out of jars attached to trees to collect tasty date palm sap, and fatal outbreaks in Bangladesh of Nipah virus, which is not related to Ebola virus, have been blamed on fresh sap contaminated with bat saliva, urine, or feces. Palm sap gatherers should be encouraged to put bamboo covers on their collecting jars to keep bats out, Dr Olival said.

For the study, published this month in Emerging Infectious Diseases [see comment below], his team caught 276 bats in 4 Bangladesh districts. "These bats roost in caves, but there are very few caves in Bangladesh, so we put up mist nets outside old ruins that looked like something out of 'Indiana Jones,' " he said. "In the evenings, they would come out to forage." The team would untangle the bats, draw blood and take saliva, urine, and fecal samples, and release them.

Five of them -- all from the _Rousettus leschenaultii_ species -- reacted to tests for antibodies to the Zaire Ebola virus [Zaire ebolavirus]. The researchers did not find any virus itself, so it was not possible to do genetic sequencing and see exactly how close the match to the African strain was.

Although closely related species of fruit bats are found in Africa, India, and China, their territories do not overlap and these bats don't migrate long distances, Dr Olival said, so it was likely the virus had been in a bat ancestor species for millenniums. A related virus, Ebola Reston [Reston ebolavirus that is, the related filovirus Reston virus], which is not known to sicken humans, has been found in Philippines fruit bats, and an "Ebola-like" virus [Lloviu virus] has been found in insect-eating bats in Spain. But the match in Bangladesh was closest to Zaire ebolavirus.

Ebola virus was at first thought to be a gorilla virus, because human outbreaks began after people ate the bodies of dead gorillas. But scientists believe that bats are the natural reservoir and that primates may get infected by eating fruit that bats have drooled or defecated on.

[The press report above is based on a paper recently published in the Journal 'Emerging Infectious Diseases': Olival KJ, Islam A, Yu M, et al: Ebola Virus Antibodies in Fruit Bats, Bangladesh. Emerg Infect Dis. 2013; 19(2): 270-3. doi: 10.3201/eid1902.120524; available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/2/12-0524_article.htm.

The abstract reads: To determine geographic range for Ebola virus, we tested 276 bats in Bangladesh. 5 (3.5 percent) bats were positive for antibodies against Ebola Zaire and Reston viruses; no virus was detected by PCR. [Nor was an infectious virus isolated - Mod.CP]. These bats might be a reservoir for Ebola or Ebola-like viruses, and extend the range of filoviruses to mainland Asia.

Filoviruses are zoonotic pathogens that cause episodic, lethal, hemorrhagic outbreaks among humans and nonhuman primates and case-fatality rates up to 80 percent. The family _Filoviridae_ contains 2 genera: _Marburgvirus_, which contains Marburg virus (MARV), and _Ebolavirus_, which contains 4 viruses: Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), Sudan ebolavirus, Reston virus (REBOV), and Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus, and 2 tentative species (Bundibugyo ebolavirus and Lloviu virus). Pathogenicity varies among ebolaviruses, from ZEBOV, which is highly lethal in humans, to REBOV, which causes disease in pigs and macaques but asymptomatically infects humans. Despite their role in human disease, natural reservoirs of filoviruses have remained elusive for decades. Reports suggest that bats (Order _Chiroptera_) are the primary natural hosts, including Old World insectivorous bats (genera _Rhinolophus_ and _Miniopterus_) and frugivorous bats (family _Pteropodidae_). Fruit bats of the genus _Rousettus_ have been implicated as a reservoir of filoviruses in Africa and Reston virus in the Philippines. Lloviu ebolavirus [more correctly Lioviu filovirus] was detected in _Miniopterus schreibersii_ insectivorous bats from Spain and appears to cause pathologic changes in this species but is not known to infect humans. These studies point to a wide, and still poorly described, geographic distribution for viruses of the family _Filoviridae_ in chiropteran hosts. We screened bats of several species from Bangladesh for ebolavirus infection to determine whether the geographic range of this virus extends to southern Asia. Our study provides evidence of ebolavirus infection in wildlife from mainland Asia and corroborates the observation that filoviruses are harbored across a much larger geographic range then assumed. Preferential reactivity to ZEBOV suggests exposure to an ebolavirus that is distinct from REBOV, the only filovirus currently found in Asia. We consider the likelihood of cross-reactivity with MARV as low because there is only a 35 percent aa identity between nucleoprotein genes of REBOV/ZEBOV and MARV. However, we cannot rule out co-infection with multiple filoviruses.

Seroprevalence found in this study is consistent with that found in another study. However, other studies of _Rousettus_ spp. bats have reported higher values (such as, 7-20 percent and 8 percent of _R. aegyptiacus_ bats seropositive for MARV and ZEBOV, respectively), and 5 (31 percent) of 16 _R. amplexicaudatus_ bats seropositive for REBOV. These differences might have been caused by poor specificity of the assay if this virus is novel, an artifact of low volume of blood collected, the potential that other species may have greater roles as reservoirs than _Rousettus_ spp. in Bangladesh, or timing of sampling. _R. leschenaultii_ bats have a large range (China to India); and more detailed studies of virus ecology and diversity are warranted to better understand their role as a potential reservoir of zoonotic disease agents.

The authors conclude that: "We demonstrated that serologic and virus surveys of bats can be informative for identifying potential virus hosts. Previous studies amplified ZEBOV nucleic acid from bat feces. We also screened bat feces to identify potential routes of virus excretion, which is useful when the route of exposure from bats to humans is known. A short interval for ebolavirus shedding by reservoir hosts and an inverse relationship between viremia and antivirus titer probably explain our negative PCR results for seropositive bats. Failure to detect filovirus nucleic acid might reflect our relatively small sample size, low virus prevalence, or use of a PCR that has low sensitivity for filoviruses circulating in Bangladesh.

In Bangladesh, human outbreaks of Nipah virus have been linked to drinking date palm sap contaminated with bat excreta, presumably from _Pteropus giganteus_ bats. _R. leschenaultii_ bats and other small fruit bat species visit date palm trees 10 times more frequently than _Pteropus_ spp. bats. This finding could indicate potential transmission of filoviruses or any other novel viruses that _R. leschenaultii_ bats carry. It also highlights the need for more research to understand this ecologic system and for better implementation of low-cost barriers to reduce bat-human contact during periods of date palm harvesting."

The haemorrhagic fever virus, ebolavirus, was initially considered to be a gorilla virus, because human outbreaks of ebolavirus-mediated haemorrhagic disease occurred after people consumed the bodies of dead gorillas. But accumulating evidence has suggested that bats might be the natural reservoir and that primates may get infected by eating fruit that bats had drooled on or had contaminated (as has been confirmed in the case of Nipah virus_. The research described above confirms that ebola-like viruses, that is, members of the virus family _Filoviridae_, are probably present everywhere there are bats, and are not confined to the African continent. Recently, an independent study carried out by researchers from Airlangga University's Avian Influenza-zoonosis Research Center in Surabaya, East Java, report that they have detected evidence of ebolavirus in several orangutans in Kalimantan. They reported that 65 serum samples collected from 353 healthy orangutans between December 2005 and December 2006 tested positive for ebolavirus infection. The orangutan is only found in Kalimantan and Sumatra. (Serological Evidence of Ebola Virus Infection in Indonesian Orangutans. PLoS ONE 7(7): e40740. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0040740. Open access article via http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0040740].

Similarly, an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for ebolavirus using recombinant nucleocapsid protein was employed in a sero-surveillance study of Chinese bat populations. The results revealed the presence of antibodies to ebolavirus in 32 of 843 bat sera samples and 10 of 16 were further confirmed by western blot analysis (Yuan J, Zhang Y, Li J, Zhang Y, Wang LF, Shi Z: Serological evidence of ebolavirus infection in bats, China. Virol J. 2012; 13(9): 236; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3492202/).

A common feature of these studies is that taxonomic terminology is misused. Infectious virus was not isolated in these surveys and the serological assays were not specific for any particular filovirus strain (or virus species). The evidence shows only that broadly cross-reactive filovirus antibodies can be detected in bat populations, probably worldwide. As yet the results do not indicate that filoviruses with potential for causing haemorrhagic fever are present worldwide. - Mod.CP
