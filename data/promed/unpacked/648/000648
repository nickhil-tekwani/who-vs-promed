In Berlin, the number of reported cases of Lyme disease has increased in recent years. In 2021, 994 cases of the disease triggered by tick bites were reported to the Robert Koch Institute. In 2020, there were 959 cases, and in 2019, the number was 851 cases. "There were significantly more forest visitors in the pandemic years, so that was certainly an important factor in the increase," Berlin-based biologist and tick expert Olaf Kahl told German Press Agency.

Tick activity has not been particularly high since 2020, he said. "People have been exposed to more tick bites due to increased visits to the countryside," said the managing director of tick-radar GmbH, which conducts research projects on ticks nationwide. Fewer than 800 cases had been reported to the RKI in both 2017 and 2018.

According to Kahl, the months from March to July are the months with the strongest tick activity on average over many years. With their bite, ticks can transmit bacteria and viruses that trigger diseases such as Lyme disease and meningitis [encephalitis] (TBE) [Tick-Borne Encephalitis].

Those who stay on wide paths do not have to fear tick bites in forests and parks. As soon as one leaves the ways, however, it becomes dangerous. The animals hide in the leaf litter.

Kahl also advises that it is best to visit a toilet again before visiting the forest, because stepping out in the forest may be a special risk situation as far as tick bites are concerned. "So after each visit to the countryside, you should thoroughly check your body and clothing for ticks," the expert said.

[Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease) is the most common human tick-borne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere, occurring predominately in temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. It is caused by pathogenic genospecies of the spirochete, _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex, a genetically diverse group of spirochetes (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3167092/). Vectors of _B. burgdorferi_ are hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks, and various small- and medium-sized mammals and ground-feeding bird species are reservoir-competent hosts.

The species of tick, the host species, borrelial genospecies, and carriage rates of borreliae in ticks all vary according to the geographical location. The patterns of disease also differ by geographical location. For example, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and neuroborreliosis are more common in Europe, whereas arthritis appears to be prevalent in the United States.

At least 3 species of the _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex (_B. afzelii_, _B. garinii_, and _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto) are known to cause Lyme disease in humans, although _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto is the most common pathogenic species to cause Lyme disease in North America. It also occurs in Europe, but is less prevalent in most regions than _B. garinii_ or _B. afzelii_, the 2 major European pathogenic genospecies.

Individual ticks can be infected with more than one genospecies of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex. In Europe, _B. burgdorferi_ genospecies that cause Lyme borreliosis are mainly transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_. In a literature review of studies of the prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato in _I. ricinus_ ticks in various European countries, the overall mean prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_-infected ticks was 13.7% (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/): Regions with the highest infection rates are located in central Europe (Austria, Czech Republic, southern Germany, Switzerland, Slovakia, and Slovenia); The infection rate in adult ticks (18.6%) was considerably higher infection rate than in nymphs (10.1%). In Switzerland, 13.6 to 49% of ticks were infected. In the Austria/Switzerland region, of positive ticks, 25% were infected with _B. afzelii_, 44% with _B. garinii_, and 25% with _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto. No significant difference was seen when the prevalence of each _Borrelia_ species in nymphs was compared to that in adults (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/).

Since _Borrelia burgdorferi_, the cause of Lyme disease, _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, the cause of anaplasmosis (also known as human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA), _Babesia microti_, the cause of babesiosis, _Borrelia miyamotoi_, the cause of a relapsing fever-like illness, and tick-borne encephalitis virus or TBEV, the cause of tick-borne encephalitis or TBE, are all transmitted by the same hard-bodied _Ixodes_ tick species (_I. ricinus_) in the same geographic locations in Europe, it is possible that co-infections with 2 or more of these tick-borne pathogens may occur.

TBE is an important vaccine-preventable viral zoonosis that has been reported to be increasing in Europe (please see ProMED post Tick-borne encephalitis - France (03): (AR) raw cheese, context 20200619.7486311), as has Lyme disease (https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/246167/Fact-sheet-Lyme-borreliosis-Eng.pdf). TBE is caused by a flavivirus (tickborne encephalitis virus or TBEV). There are 3 main subtypes of TBEV (European, Siberian, and Far East), the European subtype being transmitted mainly by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_ (_I. persulcatus_ transmitting the other subtypes). Food transmission through the consumption of unpasteurized milk or dairy products from an infected ruminant can also occur.

_Borrelia miyamotoi_ has been reported to occur infrequently in clinical human cases throughout Europe, consistent with its low prevalence in _Ixodes ricinus_ ticks (https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13071-018-2713-z).

Typically, the nymph stage of the tick, which is about the size of a poppy seed, transmits these diseases. For a picture of the nymph, see http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/babesiosis/. - Mod.ML
