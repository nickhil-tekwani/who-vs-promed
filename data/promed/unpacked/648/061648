Update 96 - Taiwan, China: SARS transmission interrupted in last
outbreak area -------------------------------------
WHO is today removing Taiwan from its list of areas with recent local
transmission of SARS. This achievement means that all known chains of
person-to-person transmission of the SARS virus have now been broken.
"With the last known chain of transmission interrupted in Taiwan, the
whole world can breathe an initial sigh of relief," said Dr David
Heymann, the WHO Executive Director for communicable diseases. "At
the same time, public health must not let down its guard, as more
cases could still surface somewhere in the world. SARS has taught us
that a single case is capable of igniting an outbreak."
"Taiwan was unlucky. A lapse in infection control in a single
hospital allowed the outbreak, which had been under good control, to
escalate. But the authorities reacted quickly and appropriately. In
doing so, they have also strengthened capacity to deal with any
future outbreaks."
The last reported probable case in Taiwan, and--for the moment--in
the world, was detected and isolated on 15 June. Two consecutive
10-day incubation periods have now passed with no further cases
detected.
The achievement comes just slightly more than four months since the
virus began moving around the world, in late February, along the
routes of international air travel.
Taiwan's first case of SARS occurred in a 54-year-old businessman
with a travel history, in late February, to Guangdong Province,
China, where the earliest cases of SARS are now known to have
occurred. The businessman was hospitalized on 8 March.
Taiwan eventually had to cope with the third largest outbreak on
record, including 674 cases and 84 deaths. The largest outbreaks
occurred in mainland China (5327 cases and 348 deaths) and Hong Kong
(1755 cases and 298 deaths).
The outbreak in Taiwan initially grew slowly, with only 23 probable
cases detected in the first month. Of these, a single health care
worker, a doctor, became infected when he treated the wife of the
businessman. All of the earliest cases could be directly linked to
close contact with a SARS patient, or had a history of recent travel
to an area where local transmission was known to be occurring. Only 4
of the early cases resulted from secondary spread within Taiwan.
The outbreak began to escalate in mid-April following a lapse in
infection control procedures, which allowed the disease to spread
rapidly within the hospital setting and then into the wider
community. In dealing with the emergency that followed, health
authorities rapidly introduced a series of sweeping measures. The
surveillance system was upgraded and began to deliver the kind of
information needed for prompt and targeted action. Hospital
procedures for infection control were tightened, and a logistics
system was developed to ensure the efficient delivery of protective
equipment and other supplies.
Mass education campaigns persuaded the population to check frequently
for fever and report promptly at fever clinics, which greatly reduced
the time between onset of symptoms and isolation of patients. The
establishment of a mechanism for coordinating the response of all
relevant sectors was another key to Taiwan's success.
The global SARS outbreak developed quickly and dramatically, creating
challenging and stressful demands on staff and health authorities at
every outbreak site. The containment of SARS required heroic efforts
and extraordinary measures that are difficult to sustain over time.
"Interruption of the last known chain of person-to-person
transmission has come just in time. Health systems at every major
outbreak site were strained to the limits of their capacity." said Dr
Heymann.
WHO continues to receive rumours of possible cases, which indicates
that surveillance systems are working well. To date, all recently
reported possible cases have been aggressively investigated and
determined to have other causes. Failure to detect new cases over the
next two weeks will greatly increase confidence that the SARS
coronavirus has indeed been pushed out of its new human host,
although a return of the disease cannot be ruled out completely on
the basis of current knowledge.

[Let us hope this is truly the end of the alarming SARS outbreak.
WHO deserves congratulations in its skillful management of this first
global emerging infectious disease of the 21st century. Credit must
be given to numerous health care workers (often acting at great
personal risk), infection control practitioners, public health
workers and officials, and laboratory scientists in bringing the
outbreak under control, at least for the present. - Mod.LM]
