Health officials in the South Sulawesi city of Makassar carried out
house-to-house checks for signs of anthrax infections in humans
following the deaths of at least 20 animals. 60 officials were
deployed to 'inform the population about the disease and what to do
to prevent it, and at the same time... detect any cases of human
infection,' Makassar's health office head Naisah said.
Naisah told Agence France-Presse that after the 1st case of animal
anthrax infection was confirmed on 11 Nov 2005, local authorities set
up a centre to deal with the outbreak at Tamangapa village, with more
than 200 people appearing for checks. She said health officials had
taken blood samples from 11 people. 4 of them showed superficial
symptoms of anthrax and the rest were people with a high
susceptibility to the disease because of their work.
Nurlina Saking, from the Makassar animal husbandry office, said more
than 20 cows and water buffalos were believed to have died of anthrax
although only 4 cases were confirmed.
A ban on the movement of livestock in and out of the area was being
enforced, she said, while officials were gearing up for a massive
vaccination campaign, with 65 000 doses being prepared for distribution.
Sick animals were being treated with antibiotics, she added.

[A version of this was published in the Daily Times, Pakistan, 24 Nov 2005,
<http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2005%5C11%5C21%5Cstory_21-11-2005_pg6_19>
According to INDOSIAR, some 50 000 doses of vaccine have been ordered
with 15 000 designated specifically for Makasar.

Apparently the last case reported in Makasar was some 10 years
previous to this outbreak. While various hypotheses have been
proposed, it is notable that there are always more cases of anthrax
reported at this time. This may not be unrelated to upcoming Muslim
Idul Adha festivities, which involves sacrificing animals. So it may
just reflect increased activities in slaughterhouses, including
veterinary inspection and surveillance. - Mod.MHJ]

Amid rising concerns over the spread of anthrax in the region, the
Bogor Health and the Bogor Husbandry Agencies will increase
monitoring by coordinating with community health centers (Puskesmas)
and integrated health service posts (Posyandu), an official of the
Bogor Health Agency told The Jakarta Post on Saturday.
"Their roles will be monitoring their respective areas to detect a
possible anthrax outbreak," the head of prevention and eradication of
infectious diseases and community health of the Health Agency, Eulis
Wulantari, said. She said that her office had found an anthrax case
in October 2005 from Babakan Madang district and that the person had
since recovered.
Fears of anthrax infection in humans have been high following the
deaths of at least 20 head of cattle and water buffaloes in Makassar,
South Sulawesi, recently. After taking blood samples of people with
high exposure to cattle, 4 cases were confirmed.
West Java -- along with other livestock breeding areas such as East
Java and East Nusa Tenggara -- has long dealt with anthrax infection
in animals, but has never reached epidemic proportions until 2004,
when 6 people died in Babakan Madang district, Bogor regency after
they consumed goat meat infected with anthrax.
Eulis said that there were at least 9 endemic locations for anthrax
in the Bogor regency including the Babakan Madang, Cibinong,
Citeurep, Kelapa Nunggal, Tajur Halang, Sukaraja, Jonggol, Sukamulya
and Cilengsi districts.
"Human anthrax infection has also occurred in 4 districts, namely
Babakan Madang, Cibinong, Sukaraja and Citeurep," Eulis said.
Eulis said that anthrax infection usually happens at the start of the
rainy season when grass turns green and anthrax spores thrive and are
eaten by livestock.
Separately, the Bogor Husbandry Agency's prevention and eradication
of animal diseases head Tinnie Mulyawati said that the Bogor
Husbandry and Fisheries Agency has vaccinated some 30 000 livestock
in Citaringgul village in Babakan Madang. The agency has also
disseminated information about the disease through posters and
brochures warning people about the dangers of the disease. "We urge
breeders in Bogor to immediately report to us or related institutions
if they find symptoms of anthrax in sick livestock," Tinnie said.

[Why the Indonesian outbreaks traditionally occur at the beginning of
the rains is obscure and awaiting clarification. Claims that _B.
anthracis_ multiplies in soil are not new and recently gained support
by the finding that the vegetative organism liked to multiply close
to grass roots. Unfortunately this laboratory experiment was done in
sterile circumstances. Way back in 1944, Minette and Dhanda showed
that _B. anthracis_ could multiply in soil but only if the soil had
been sterilised first; in normal soil it apparently was unable to
compete for nutrients and/or was killed by proximity to organisms
such as Streptomyces. Speculatively, these outbreaks follow upon the
forage growth-rush in response to the first rain, and the
rain-softened soil is pulled up and eaten by the grazing cow(s) along
with any spores in the soil. Animals at this time will be relatively
malnourished and thus with poor innate resistance. In a few more
weeks of good and abundant grazing the situation will be different. - Mod.MHJ]
