[In ProMED-mail post 20110823.2570, the moderator posed some questions
about testing flying foxes for Hendra virus. - Mod TG]

Testing of flying foxes involve getting in under the camps in the
morning and spreading out plastic sheets and then collecting them up
again in the evening. The collected urine is then pooled and tested.

There is no evidence of humans developing antibodies to HeV from this
kind of exposure. This was reported in: Selvey, L, et al: Screening of
Bat Carers For Antibodies to Equine Morbillivirus. The kind of testing
that is presently undertaken is not super stressful.

These animals don't shed virus all the time -- just for the 7 days or
so after infection and prior to the development of anti-bodies.

The flying foxes are attracted to native or exotic fruit or blossoms,
rather than the fruit or the fruit trees. These flying foxes are
unusual in that they primarily feed on nectar rather than fruit. These
messages are continuously reinforced by both the government and
co-operating non-government organisations. These flying-fox species
aren't so much messy or slobbery eaters but they do spit out all the
fibre in the food 'spats' which may be eaten by horses. [Which this
moderator calls messy eaters. - Mod.TG]

[The hendravirus equine cases certainly have been unusual this year.
Nipanvirus studies with _Pteropus_ fruit bats in Malaysia and
Bangladesh indicate that the females shed virus when pregnant and
lactating. This is not surprising, given the reduction in
immunocompetence during these stages. There is also considerable
movement between roosting areas, which may be the reason for the
scattered equine cases. That suggests to me that culling bats is
unlikely to be effective. The best preventive measure, until a vaccine
comes, along is reduction of fruit trees near pastures and barns. -

I appreciate the information on the flying foxes. Lets hope the cases
of Hendra virus subsides soon. - Mod.TG]
