Kenya has reported an outbreak of yellow fever, a deadly disease spread by mosquitoes. The Ministry of Health says 3 patients have already died from the disease in Isiolo County.

Acting Director-General for Health Patrick Amoth said in total, 15 people are suspected to have the disease, but only 3 cases have been confirmed. The confirmed cases are in Merti and Garbatulla sub-counties of Isiolo.

"The 1st case was detected on 12 Jan 2022. To date, 15 patients presenting with fever, jaundice, muscle pain and joint pain have been line-listed, the youngest being 11 years and the oldest being 65 years," Amoth said in a letter to health CECs across the country on Friday [4 Mar 2022]. The majority of the sick are young male adults.

However, the ministry will likely face criticism because although the 1st case was reported on 12 Jan [2022], no alert was issued.

"Sadly, we have recorded 3 deaths so far. Out of the 6 samples analysed at KEMRI [Kenya Medical Research Institute], 3 turned positive through serology (immunoglobulin M) and PCR," Amoth said.

He put the entire country on alert but said the high-risk counties of Wajir, Garissa, Marsabit, Meru, Samburu, Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet, West Pokot, and Turkana should be more watchful. He said the national government and partners are already mobilising resources to support response activities including vaccination.

"The ministry plans to conduct yellow fever vaccination in Isiolo and other high-risk counties, including Wajir, Garissa, Marsabit, Meru, Samburu, Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet, West Pokot, Turkana, and possibly Tana River and Mandera," he said.

The ministry will also deploy a rapid response team to Isiolo and neighboring counties to establish the magnitude and extent of the outbreak, determine at-risk populations, conduct a risk assessment, initiate risk communication and community engagement activities, and implement integrated vector control measures.

The last indigenous cases of yellow fever reported in Kenya occurred from mid-1992 through March 1993 in the south Kerio Valley.

The WHO continues to place Kenya on its watchlist because of the extremely low yellow fever vaccination rate. The jab, offered once in a lifetime, is sold at KES 2000 [USD 17.5] in limited places across the country.

Estimates from WHO and UNICEF in 2020 on routine yellow fever vaccination coverage was 44% in the African region, much lower than the 80% threshold required to confer herd immunity against yellow fever.

Last week, the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE), told the Star that yellow fever could return because of the abundance of the mosquito varieties that transmit it.

Shillah Simiyu, an infectious disease scientist at ICIPE [International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology], said if they are infected with the virus, they will easily transmit the disease to many people.

"[Kenya] is also potentially at risk of yellow fever re-emergence given the recent recurrent yellow fever outbreaks in the neighbouring countries of Uganda, South Sudan, and Ethiopia with the possibility of cross-border spillover either through infected non-human primates, humans, or mosquitoes," she said.

Between February to June 2021, Shillah and her team collected 3865 mosquitoes belonging to 37 different mosquito species in Nguruman (Kajiado county) and 1973 in Kerio Valley (Baringo county).

"Yellow fever vectors accounted for 37.9% of Nguruman's mosquito collection," Shillah says. In Kerio Valley, the types of mosquitoes that spread yellow fever -- _Aedes aegypti_, _Aedes simpsoni_, and _Aedes vittatus_ -- were the most abundant with abundances of 42.3%, 16.6%, and 7.6%, respectively. _Aedes africanus_, which was implicated in Kenya's last outbreak in 1992, only accounted for 0.10% of the collection. "Therefore, there is a need to intensify surveillance and vector control strategies in these areas," she said. She also presented her findings at the recently-ended Kemri annual scientific and health conference in Nairobi," she said.

Once contracted, the yellow fever virus incubates in the body for 3-6 days. Many people do not experience symptoms, but when these do occur, the most common are fever, muscle pain with prominent backache, headache, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. In most cases, symptoms disappear after 3-4 days, Dr Amoth said.

"A small percentage of patients, however, enter a 2nd, more toxic phase within 24 hours of recovering from initial symptoms. High fever returns and several body systems are affected, usually the liver and the kidneys," he added. In this phase people are likely to develop jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes, hence the name "yellow fever"), dark urine and abdominal pain with vomiting. Bleeding can occur from the mouth, nose, eyes or stomach. Half of the patients who enter the toxic phase die within 7-10 days.

He said the disease is difficult to diagnose, especially during the early stages. A more severe case can be confused with severe malaria, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis (especially fulminant forms), other haemorrhagic fevers, infection with other flaviviruses (such as dengue haemorrhagic fever), and poisoning.

There is currently no specific anti-viral drug for yellow fever, but specific care to treat dehydration, liver and kidney failure, and fever improves outcomes. Associated bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics.

[Kenya has experienced cases of yellow fever (YF) infrequently. The low vaccination rate is of concern. One hopes that the rapid response will lead to a prompt vaccination campaign in the affected areas. A YF vaccine shortage was reported in 2020 (see Yellow fever - Africa (04): Kenya vaccine shortage 20200130.6935353). Apparently that shortage has ended.

The previous outbreak was in 1991-1993 (see references below). During that outbreak, a report indicated that nearly all confirmed infections were acquired between 1500 and 1800 m (4900-5900 ft) in the Tugen Hills (Baringo district, Rift Valley province). Transmission appeared to be entirely sylvatic, that is, all confirmed cases were independent of other human cases and had acquired their infection by contact with mosquitoes that had been infected by feeding on viraemic monkeys. Infected mosquitoes (_Aedes africanus_ and _Ae. keniensis_) were captured close to a cluster of human cases at about 1700 m (5577 ft) (see Yellow fever - Africa (17): Kenya, background 20110504.1377). Although the mosquito vectors in the current outbreak have not been reported, the mosquito surveys done in the 2 counties reported above, although distant from the current outbreak, do indicate that that vector mosquitoes capable of urban transmission are present in Kenya.
