Saskatchewan Agriculture is reminding producers to be on the lookout for anthrax in their animals after confirmation that anthrax has been found in the RM of South Qu'Appelle no. 157. Anthrax was confirmed by laboratory results on 7 Jul 2021 as the cause of death in one animal in a flock of sheep. It is the suspected cause of death of 4 additional sheep on the same premises.

Anthrax is caused by the bacteria _Bacillus anthracis_, which can survive in spore form for decades in soil. Changes in soil moisture, from flooding and drying, can lead to a build-up of the spores on pastures. Spores can concentrate in sloughs and potholes, and there is increased risk of animal exposure to anthrax in drier years when these areas dry up and become accessible. Spores can also surface when the ground is excavated or when there is excessive run-off.

Livestock are infected when they eat forage contaminated with spores. Ruminants such as bison, cattle, sheep and goats are highly susceptible, and horses can also be infected. Swine, birds and carnivores are more resistant to infection, but farm dogs and cats should be kept away from carcasses.

Affected animals are usually found dead without any signs of illness. Anthrax can be prevented by vaccination. Producers in regions that have experienced previous outbreaks are strongly encouraged to vaccinate their animals each year. If your neighbours' animals have anthrax, you should consider vaccination to protect your animals.

The carcasses of any animal suspected of having anthrax should not be moved or disturbed and should be protected from scavengers such as coyotes or ravens to prevent spreading spores in the environment.

Anyone who suspects anthrax should contact their local veterinarian immediately for diagnosis. All tests must be confirmed by a laboratory diagnosis. All positive test results must be immediately reported to the provincial Chief Veterinary Officer.

Producers are advised to use caution when handling potentially infected animals or carcasses. Animal cases pose minimal risk to humans, but people can become infected through direct contact with sick animals or carcasses. In cases where people believe they have been exposed to an infected animal, they should contact their local health authority or physician for advice.

[There was a severe epidemic in 2006 affecting the whole province with 153 ranches affected, involving 493 cattle, 254 farmed bison, 35 sheep and goats, 6 horses, and 3 pigs. There was a significant and effective vaccination response involving 400 000 cattle. As a result, there were only 6 outbreaks in 2007 with 14 cattle affected and 1403 vaccinated; in 2008, 3 outbreaks, 14 cattle affected, and 780 vaccinated; and in 2009, 2 outbreaks, 18 head affected, and 736 vaccinated. There were sporadic outbreaks in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2015. The provincial veterinary service has an active programme to maintain awareness of this disease, to report unexpected deaths, and the real need for the ranch owners to vaccinate their stock each spring. And they are successful. In a dry summer, the moisture in a slough maintains green grazing and attracts animals. This can put animals at risk if in previous years an animal has died of anthrax in this slough, contaminating the soil, and the spores will lurk there and can in certain circumstances germinate and multiply in the root mass of this grazing -- which is why it is so important to vaccinate your livestock, especially cattle, each spring.

The Saskatchewan veterinary service has been striving hard to control this disease and with success. And then there are outbreaks like this to remind everyone to keep it up. As the value of an individual sheep is slight, ovine cases can be missed until the numbers increase. This is life.
