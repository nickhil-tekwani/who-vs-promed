A new, but not surprising, outbreak of dengue started last June and, if
mosquito control actions are not taken aggressively, we may face the worst
outbreak of the last nine years. According to the National Direction of
Epidemiological Surveillance, from January to June (week 25), there have
been 18 598 cases; 15 939 (85.7%) corresponded to DF and 2659 (14.3%) to
DHF/DSS with 10 (0.05%) fatalities.
In Aragua State, according to the Coordinator of the Comite Local para el
Control y la Prevention del Dengue en Aragua (CLCPDA), Dr Iris Villalobos
de Chacon, a total of 1,448 dengue cases have been reported from January
to July (week 30). 1149 (79,4%) of these cases were DF and 299 (20,6%) DHF
with one (0.07%) fatality.
DHF cases in January -- tail of 1997 outbreak -- were 15.5% (46/224),
dropped to 15.0% (19/127) by April and, from there on, increased steadily
to reach 22.4% (80/357) in June and 23.2% (79/341) in July.
As the core of the Regional Active Epidemiological Surveillance Program,
the Laboratorio Regional de Diagnostico e Investigacion del Dengue y otras
Enfermedades Virales (LARDIDEV) has processed 320 sera for virological and
serological confirmation of dengue reported cases. The number of
presumptive clinical diagnoses reported by physicians in the questionnaires
that accompanied the serum samples were:
155 (48,4%) DF
76 (23,8%) DHF
3 (0.9%) DSS
23 (7.2%) DF with hemorrhagic episodes, but without thrombobcytopenia
[platelet counts not lowered or evidence of plasma leakage
......................................................
1 (0.3%) exanthemic reactions [rash etiologically undetermined
1 (0.3%) systemic inflammatory reactions
2 (0.6%) rubella
16 (5.0%) febrile syndromes
8 (2.5%) viral syndromes etiologically undetermined, and
35 (10.9%) unknown cases (item not filled).
The 63 cases reported as illness other than dengue or unknown evidenced two
of the biggest problems our physicians are dealing with: the lack of
recognition of dengue cases according to WHO case definitions and the
forgotten attitude towards filling the item of the presumptive clinical
diagnosis.
Of the 320 cases, 118 (36.9%) were confirmed by virus isolation in C6/36 HT
mosquito derived cells and/or RT-PCR; 109 (34.1%) or 113 (35.3%) were
probable cases diagnosed by IgM capture ELISA or HI (>1/1280 titer). The
relative frequency of virologically-confirmed cases in females was slightly
greater than in males (38.3% vs. 35.2%), and the most affected age group
was from 11 to 15 years old (45.6%).
Of the 118 virologically-confirmed dengue cases, 56 (47.4%) were infected
by Den-1 serotype, 48 (40.7%) by Den-2, 13 (11.0%) by Den-4 and one (0.9%)
was a mixed infection of Den-2 and Den-4 serotypes (detected by RT-PCR).
The only fatal reported case -- a 6 year old girl -- was also
virologically-confirmed by RT-PCR as Den-2 serotype (in serum and spleen,
liver and lung tissues).
The absolute and relative frequencies of the 257 cases reported as
presumptive dengue and confirmed virologically were: 52 (33.5%) DF, 38
(50.0%) DHF, 2 (66.7%) DSS and 9 (39.1%) DFHM [ DF with hemorrhagic
episodes.
In DF cases, Den-2 serotype was a little more prevalent than Den-1 (14.2%
vs. 13.5%) and also responsible for the 2 DSS cases. In the DHF cases,
however, the situation was dramatically opposite: Den-1 serotype prevailed
over Den-2 (28.9% vs. 18.4%).
We are convinced that this hyperendemic situation occasioned by the
simultaneous circulation of a large number of dengue viruses (118) of
different serotypes (Den-1, Den-2 and Den-4) will drive the Aragua State --
and probably the whole nation -- to huge outbreaks of DHF within the next 2
or 5 years if mosquito control measures (basically elimination of breeding
sites) are not applied aggressively and efficiently. The CLCPDA, recently
created -- in June [1998 -- to deal with this problem, started a intensive
and very laborious program to eliminate, or reduce significantly, mosquito
breeding sites. The program, which combines governmental technical support
with community actions, is focused in areas (barrios and/or municipios)
where dengue cases have increased constantly year after year.

[We are extremely grateful to Drs Comach & Villalobos de Chacon for this
very detailed report, giving the laboratory basis for their gloomy
forecast. This kind of careful laboratory work is basic to forming any
valid epidemiological analysis of the situation. - Mod.JW
