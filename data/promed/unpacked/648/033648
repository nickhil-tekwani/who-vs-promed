Brown rust is spreading in wheat crops in south eastern England due to warm humid weather. The disease normally affects wheat crops largely in Kent and Essex, but it is spreading through crops across East Anglia and is becoming a serious problem.

Tim Boor, ADAS [independent provider of agricultural and environmental consultancy, rural development services, and policy advice], says the recent warm weather has potentially made brown rust more of a threat then yellow rust in eastern England. "Brown rust has been in crops for some time but over the last 2 weeks it has really started to develop because of the warmer weather," he adds.

The disease tends to like warmer weather than yellow rust, which explains why it is suddenly been seen more widely, after yellow rust was more of a disease concern earlier in the season. Growers who have not used a fungicide head spray need to get on quickly.

[Leaf rust (also called brown rust) of wheat is caused by the fungus _Puccinia recondita_ (synonym _P. triticina_). Related pathogens affect barley and rye. The disease reduces the photosynthetic potential of the plant and can cause serious yield losses of over 40 per cent in individual fields. Symptoms include brick-red pustules on leaves, stems, and later on heads. Infection of the host can occur in as little as 4 hours in favourable conditions. Epidemic severity increases exponentially over time and may appear to "explode" suddenly during favourable weather.

Spores are produced as the crop ripens and are spread by wind and mechanical means. The fungus needs living tissue to survive between seasons and cannot survive on seed, stubble, or in soil. Volunteer cereal plants and certain wild grasses may generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum to infect new crops. Disease management relies mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of crop cultivars and control of volunteer crop plants. Crop monitoring is important for early discovery of infection so action can be taken to limit pathogen spread as well as build-up of inoculum.

New strains of leaf rust with increased virulence are emerging worldwide. These include strains that show additional fungicide resistances and/or the ability to break down genetic resistance of specific host varieties. Monitoring programmes have been established in different countries for early detection of new rust strains. They are often linked to regional resistance breeding programmes to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

In the UK, high levels of wheat stripe rust (_P. striiformis_) are currently also being reported. The 1st discovery of the non-European Kranich strain in the country earlier in 2016 (ProMED-mail post 20160219.4033809), as well as suspected recent changes to the previously established Warrior (ProMED-mail post 20140122.2224928) group of strains (see link below) may be contributing to the problems.
