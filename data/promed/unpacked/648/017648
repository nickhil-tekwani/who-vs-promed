Seven people were reportedly bitten by rabies-infected dogs [see comment] in Dauh Peken Village, Tabanan Regency in the latest batch of new cases involving the deadly virus on the island.

Tabanan's Animal Control Agency Head Gde Eka Parta Ariana confirmed that the incidents occurred last week and out of the 7 victims, only 5 have checked themselves to a local healthcare facility and received rabies shots. "We hope for the 2 other victims to immediately report to the nearest healthcare facilities and get vaccinated," he said.

The official added that the agency had tracked 3 stray dogs in the area, though it has yet to be confirmed if they were the ones who bit the 7 villagers. Nonetheless, the 3 dogs had been put down, as they were suspected to have recently come in close contact with other rabies-infected dogs. "The 3 dogs we already eliminated. [At least] one dog was suspected to [have been infected with rabies]," added Parta Ariana.

According to the Tabanan administration, there are 4 "red zones" in the regency when it comes to rabies risk. Recent rabies-infected dog bites occurred before the administration's mass anti-rabies vaccination program commenced this year [2022]. Under the program, 71 062 dogs are scheduled to receive the shot.

Rabies has been a major problem for around 2 decades in Bali, leading to the occasional culling of stray dogs. Ironically, it has been documented that some of the culled dogs have been vaccinated against rabies.

In Karangasem, which is located about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Tabanan, 41 people have been bitten by rabies-infected dogs this year as of April [2022].

[The term "rabies-infected dogs," used several times in the above media report, is in need of clarification. Has rabies been suspected clinically and confirmed by a lab test? In case no confirmation becomes available, these animals should be termed as "clinically rabies-suspected dogs."

Rabies was first reported in Bali islands in 2008, thought to have been introduced by fishermen from the island of Sulawesi (Indonesia). Several subsequent pilot studies to eliminate the disease from this economically tourism-oriented island have been performed. During the first 3 years following the pathogen's introduction, insufficient vaccination and an initial focus on dog elimination resulted in failure to reduce the number of cases. Island-wide mass vaccination (reaching 70% coverage, more than 200 000 dogs) led to a decline in rabies incidence and spread. However, the disease is still endemic, incidence of dog bites remains high, and repeat campaigns combined with public education are prescribed. - Mod.AS
