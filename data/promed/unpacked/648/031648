England: emergency vaccinations for mumps offered in Kent
---------------------------------------------------------
Dr Mathi Chandrakumar, director of the Kent Health Protection Unit,
announced a mumps vaccination program, after cases rose from 39 last year
[2003] to 113 so far in 2004. Dr Chandrakumar said the rise was not an
epidemic, but protection was needed. Health officials are targeting up to
30 000 at-risk teenagers at 8 tertiary education sites.
Dr Chandrakumar told BBC South East Today: "We don't need to be worried as
long as this campaign is successful, and we can prevent large numbers of
cases. We know it works, because, when we had an outbreak in the University
of Kent, we carried out a campaign, and we stopped it in its tracks; we did
not have any further cases." The mumps immunization centers include the
following: Canterbury College (Canterbury); Christchurch University College
(Canterbury and Thanet); South Kent College (Ashford); West Kent College
(Tonbridge); Oakwood Park Centre (Maidstone); and Mid Kent College (City
Way site).
Dr Chandrakumar said outbreaks were occurring in people too old to have
been offered measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) jabs routinely as children.
The MMR program only started in 1988. Dr Chandrakumar said the vaccination
was "perfectly safe" and did not have any serious side effects.
Kent University completed a round of immunizations for new students at the
start of term in late October 2004. Other UK universities are also
launching mass MMR vaccinations to stem the mumps threat.
Mumps is a viral infection that is transmitted through airborne droplets
from the coughs and sneezes of infected people. It takes about 16 to 21
days between coming into contact with an infected person and the appearance
of symptoms, such as painful swelling of saliva-making glands found on
either side of the face. The vast majority of people make an easy recovery
from mumps infection. However, it can rarely cause unpleasant and painful
complications and can be particularly dangerous in young men who may
develop swelling of the testis that can cause infertility.

England: meningitis warning for Cambridge students
--------------------------------------------------
Students in Cambridge could be at risk from a new outbreak of the
potentially deadly illness meningitis. This is the warning issued by the
medical charity the Meningitis Trust. They say the recent outbreak of mumps
among university students could lead to an increase in cases of particular
strains of viral meningitis, because the viruses that cause both illnesses
are closely linked. Although the strains of meningitis concerned are very
rarely lethal, they can lead to severe side effects and after effects such
as headaches, fever, joint pain and stiffness in the neck, diarrhea,
vomiting, and aversion to light.
In total, 38 students have been struck down with mumps so far this term,
compared with a recent average of only one or 2 per academic year.
University authorities are urging students under 24 years of age to take
the triple MMR vaccine, which prevents mumps, measles, and rubella.
Bridie Taylor, community services manager with the Meningitis Trust, said
that most of the current generation of students at Cambridge had not
received the triple vaccine, because it was not introduced until the late
1980s, after their infancy. But some symptoms of mumps are similar to those
of meningitis, and Miss Taylor said: "the incubation period for mumps is
anything up to 3 weeks."
"We do not want GPs to be inundated. But, it is an especially nasty kind of
illness, and we want people to be aware of the risks. If any of these
symptoms persist for more than 3 weeks, people should seek medical help."

UK: students are being warned of an imminent mumps epidemic
-----------------------------------------------------------
Universities and colleges from the Scottish Highlands to Cornwall are
reporting massive increases in mumps cases this year [2004]. The problem is
being taken seriously in all areas. The Edinburgh Evening News reports that
"thousands of students are being offered a vaccine against mumps, after
cases in the Lothians soared 5-fold in a year." The number of suspected
cases in Grampian region alone has risen to 10 times what it was last year
[2003]. There had been 37 confirmed cases in Grampian region, 53 in Tayside
and 18 across the Highlands and Islands. In the same period, suspected
cases in Grampian have risen to 88, compared to just 8 for the whole of
2003. Almost all of the cases involve adolescents aged 13 to 25, with the
majority falling into the 17 to 20 age group.
Dr Arun Mukarjee, an expert in communicable diseases at NHS Grampian, said
that the age group accounted for about 50 per cent of the number of
reported cases this year [2004], and the high incidence of mumps could be
explained by the introduction of the MMR vaccine when they were children.
"The MMR vaccine was introduced in 1988," he said. "Initially, we started
with one dose, and the uptake was very good. As a result, mumps and measles
were almost eradicated in this country. We soon realized that not one but 2
doses of MMR were needed to give over 99 per cent protection from mumps,
so, in 1996, we gave a 2nd dose, but those born between 1984 and 1987
missed out."
Dr Mukarjee said youngsters born between those dates would have received a
2nd measles and rubella vaccine, introduced in 1996 [this was actually a
one-off campaign late in 1994. See
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/cdr/CDRreview/1994/cdrr1294.pdf> - Mod.SH], but the
jab would not protect them against mumps. "No one knows why cases are on
the increase for this age group this year [2004], as opposed to last year
or next year," he added. "What we do know is that the disease spreads like
wildfire in areas like universities." Health authorities have written to GP
practices around the north and north-east [of Scotland] asking them to
conduct selective immunization for young people aged 17 to 20.
In England, there is a similar picture. The Bath Chronicle reports that
"thousands of adults are to be offered vaccinations to prevent a mumps
epidemic in Bath. A program of inoculations is being devised to target 16
to 25 year olds, after a massive increase in cases of the infection over
the past year." The Express reported that "an outbreak of mumps has struck
85 1st year students at one university. Mass vaccination schemes are being
set up over fears of an epidemic sweeping the country." Colleagues of
students at Exeter University have been offered vaccinations, and 1000 1st
year students have so far been given the MMR jab. Stuart Franklin, a
spokesman for the university, said that "it is too early to say we are on
top of the situation, but in the last few days the number of cases has
dropped off." Oxford, Manchester, Leeds, Kent, Nottingham, and Birmingham
universities have all recently reported outbreaks of mumps. Official
figures show a dramatic rise in cases from 180 in 1996 to 3756 so far this
year. The number of cases of mumps reported at Lancaster University has
risen to 30, as health bosses warn of a national outbreak among students,
reports the Lancaster Guardian. In Plymouth, extra immunization clinics are
being added at the Bailrigg campus, as the capacity to administer MMR jabs
has been totally outstripped by demand, says the Western Morning News. Lynn
Jones, practice director at the Bailrigg Health Centre, said "we had 500
immunization packs ready for students on Tuesday [16 Nov 2004], so we were
completely unprepared when nearly 1000 turned up, and we had to turn the
rest away." In recent weeks, Exeter University has had 76 confirmed cases
of mumps in 3 of its halls of residence on campus, and 300 of its students
have already received the MMR vaccine.

[Remarkably, the mumps epidemic in young people in the 17 20 year age range
is now affecting those attending universities and tertiary education
institutions throughout the UK and Ireland. It is believed that the high
susceptibility of this age group relates to the fact that these young
people have received only a single mumps vaccination, which appears not to
be sufficient to confer complete protection. However, it is not clear why
the incidence of mumps is higher in 2004 than in immediately preceding
years. A warning of increased risk of viral meningitis, as a consequence of
the mumps epidemic, has been issued by the Meningitis Trust, although the
extent of the risk, and the viral pathogen(s) involved, have not been
specified. Central Nervous System (CNS) involvement during acute mumps
virus infection occurs at such high frequency that it has been considered
to be a primary manifestation of mumps, rather than a complication. The
consequences of CNS infection caused by mumps virus infection extend from
aseptic meningitis (common and mild) to fulminant encephalitis (rare but
life threatening). The term mumps meningoencephalitis has been coined to
cover the range of intermediate manifestations of mumps virus infection of
the CNS. - Mod.CP]
