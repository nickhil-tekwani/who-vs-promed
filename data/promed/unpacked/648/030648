We have conclusively identified the two isolates as MRSA not only by
biochemical reactions but also by sending them to the Provincial Health
Laboratory in Toronto, where they were further confirmed by Thermonuclease
test (both isolates were positive) and by PCR were they were positive for
both FEM and the Mec [mecA genes.

There is a another method to differentiate between _Staph. aureus_ and
_Staph. intermedius_ and that is to grow the culture at 42 to 45 C. _S.
intermedius_ will grow at these higher temps while _S. aureus_ will not.
This is a reliable test to differentiate [the two species and is used
commonly.

There actually was a letter published in the Lancet (Vol 344, August 20,
1994, pages 539-40) about this subject. A male nurse with MRSA colonization
was linked to MRSA transmission in a hospital. The investigation revealed
his wife (also a nurse) was colonized as well. Both were treated with
mupirocin.
Six months later another patient was found to have MRSA and the nurse and
his wife were again cultured and again were found to be positive for MRSA.
At that time it was mentioned that the nurses' dog had an eye infection.
Eye and nose cultures were taken on the dog and the dog's nose was positive
for MRSA (identical phage type to the nurses'). The letter mentions the
fact _S. intermedius_ is the most common isolate from dogs, but human
strains are occasionally isolated.
