At least 5 people were confirmed to have died in a mass outbreak of _E. coli_ O157 food poisoning in Hokkaido as of Mon 20 Aug 2012, with 110 others likely suffering from contaminated Chinese cabbage pickles.

In addition to the 5 confirmed fatalities, 2 elderly women who were residents at a nursing home in Ebetsu, which is near Sapporo, have died after developing symptoms of food poisoning. However, O157 bacteria has yet to be confirmed as the cause of their deaths. At least 3 other residents at the same facility have been hospitalized with serious symptoms.

It is strongly believed that the source of the _E. coli_ O157 outbreak was lightly pickled Chinese cabbage. The Sapporo-based food company that processed the cabbage is suspected of failing to properly sterilize the cabbage by heating.

Many details regarding how the outbreak reached epidemic proportions have yet to be clarified. One possible factor behind the mass food poisoning is a method of using less salt when pickling vegetables to suit consumer tastes.

One of the 4 fatalities in the area under the jurisdiction of the Sapporo Health Center was a 4-year-old girl who died 11 Aug 2012. Lightly pickled Chinese cabbage was a favorite food among the girl's family and was served on the dining table almost every day, her grandfather, said. "We never thought pickled vegetables could cause food poisoning and feel extremely sorry that she lost her life when the rest of our family [who also ate the same pickled cabbage] did not fall ill," he said.

The pickled Chinese cabbage in question was produced by the food company Iwai Shokuhin in Sapporo. The company shipped about 270 kilograms of pickled Chinese cabbage on 29 and 30 Jul 2012. From 11 to 19 Aug 2012, cases or suspected cases of O157 poisoning were reported at 9 out of 10 nursing care facilities in and around Sapporo that served the pickles. Many of the fatalities were people aged 80 or older, health officials said.

Mass poisoning caused by lightly pickled vegetables occurred in Saitama Prefecture in 2000, resulting in a single death, and in 2005 in Kagawa Prefecture, which resulted in 5 deaths. All fatalities were elderly residents of nursing care facilities.

In 2002, more than 100 boys and girls at a nursery in Fukuoka were infected with _E. coli_ O157. The incident was traced back to lightly pickled cucumbers.

Officials said Sun 19 Aug 2012 that 7 people, most of them elderly women, died after eating pickles contaminated with _E. coli_ O157 in northern Japan, in the country's deadliest mass food poisoning in 10 years.

A total of 103 others have been made ill after eating the same lightly pickled Chinese cabbage produced in late July 2012 by a company in the city of Sapporo, according to health bulletins issued by the local government.

Of the dead, 6 were elderly women who ate the pickles at nursing homes in Sapporo and in another city on Hokkaido island. A 4-year-old girl died on 11 Aug 2012 in Sapporo.

In the city of Ebetsu, a centenarian woman died early Sunday [19 Aug 2012] from multiple-organ failure, 9 days after she was hospitalised, a Hokkaido regional health official said. "She ate the pickles served at breakfast at her nursing home on 1 Aug 2012," the official, Narihiko Kawamura, told AFP by telephone. 2 other women in their 90s died on Thursday [16 Aug 2012] in Ebetsu after eating the pickles at nursing homes.

"It is not easy to determine how the bacteria were mixed with the pickles," official Seiichi Miyahara said. "We don't know yet whether there was any major problem in sanitary control at the company."
