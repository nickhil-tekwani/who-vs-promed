We have a CCHF [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever] confirmed case admitted in Isolation ward at Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar KPK, Pakistan. His condition is stable. He belongs to Dera Ismail Khan district of KPK [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa] province and is a butcher by profession.

Butchers are at great risk of acquiring CCHF infection in Pakistan. This is the most vulnerable population for this infection due to illiteracy and unawareness. In Abbottabad district of KPK 2 years back, we had 4 persons (3 brothers and father) belonging to a butcher's family infected from the same source and expired there.

Dera Ismail Khan is bordering with Zhobe district of Baluchistan province from where most of the animals come to nearby districts of KPK and Punjab. Zhobe is endemic for CCHF. There is immense need of health educational campaign in endemic areas.

[ProMED thanks the contributor of this report of another CCHF case in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. CCHF virus is endemic in Pakistan. Cases of CCHF occurred earlier in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and in Sindh provinces this year (2015) and in various parts of Pakistan last year (2014).

Circumstances under which the patient acquired his CCHF virus infection are likely through his occupation as a butcher. CCHF virus infections are acquired via a tick bite or exposure to the blood of an infected animal, as is likely in this case.

The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur.

The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.
