A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html>
[The following, from Nepal, arrived in response to the following comment
[Dengue - Malaysia (Petaling Jaya) 980811224308]. "[Perhaps ProMED-mail
should simply post the names of places in Asia that do not have dengue. Can
anyone name one? - Mod.CHC]"

[Okay, someone called my bluff. Just a matter of time, I suspect. We know
that various mosquito-borne diseases have occurred historically in Nepal
(Japanese encephalitis in the Terai comes to mind), and we also know that
people move across the border into Nepal from countries where dengue is
known to occur. For the time being, I stand corrected. - Mod.CHC]
