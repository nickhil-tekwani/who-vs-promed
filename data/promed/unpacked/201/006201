I am a shellfish pathologist with over 10 years experience. I have never
heard of this parasite or condition. In the US, we have had a few reports
of mechanical blockage by pelagic diatoms in larvae with elevated mortality
as an end result. We also have a parasite in the digestive tract in the
genus _Mytilicola_. In high numbers this crustacean parasite may be able to
cause problems but, again, I am not aware of mass mortality (or even
significant mortality) associated with this organism.
Do you have any more information on the parasite? Why does the researcher
feel that new product would not be affected? What is the relationship with
an acid sulphate soil run-off? Is this a stressor to induce clinical
disease? How quick is the disease? Very rapid mortality often suggests a
viral or bacterial agent.

NSW fisheries have confirmed that the problem was "QX" (Queensland unknown)
disease, caused by a protozoa _Marteilia sydneyi_. It has been around for a
number of years and caused problems in Northern NSW, Southern Qld oysters.
The disease tends to occur around March-April, but can be seen throughout
the year. Fatalities of up to 95% have been reported.
The parasite affects the digestive gland. In summer oysters die about 6
weeks after infection. Oysters affected in autumn tend to survive through
the winter.
There has been some associations made between the occurence of the disease
and a "fresh". Links have also been made to acid soil runoff, but not
proven. Both may just be stressors which allow this organism (which may be
always "in the background") to cause disease.
The life cycle of the protozoan is not known, but the involvement of an
intermediate host such as a polychaete worm has been suggested.
There is no known treatment.
Dr. Bob Lester at UQ has done a lot of work on this condition.
