The death of a woman is being investigated to determine whether it was caused by a hantavirus infection. The head of Health Zone IV confirmed for ANB that they are analyzing a case compatible with this virus infection. The regrettable death of the woman -- between 30-40 years of age -- occurred on Friday [15 Nov 2013] in a private clinic in Bariloche. In all of 2013 so far, there have been no cases of hantavirus infections in the city. The death of the woman triggered an investigation.

Samples relating to the case will be sent from Health Zone IV to the Malbran Institute in Buenos Aires for laboratory tests. The head of Zone IV, Victor Parodi, explained to ANB that this coming Thursday [21 Nov 2013] they would know whether the death was due to a hantavirus infection or from some other cause with similar symptoms.

The victim presented with pulmonary symptoms having characteristics that obliged the authorities in the private clinic to inform the health authorities of its occurrence. Now, the related epidemiological analysis will be done to determine the activities and places visited by the woman in the past 30 days. That is to say, "data will be taken to provide orientation to determine whether the disease she contracted had anything to do with a hantavirus infection."

Parodi stated that so far, 2013 "has not produced cases" of hantavirus infections, and that until now all the tests done on cases compatible with hantavirus infection symptoms "have been negative."

[Although the specific virus involved in this unfortunate case is not specified, since Bariloche is in the foothills of the Andes Mountains, the death is probably due to Andes virus infection.

Andes virus is the only hantavirus shown thus far to be transmitted directly from person to person, but only rarely, and among individuals in very close contact. One hopes that the family members in the household of the deceased woman in the above case are being monitored. Most Andes virus infections are acquired from contact with excrement of infected rodents. Andes virus occurs in western Argentina, harbored by the long-tailed pygmy rice rat reservoir host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_.
