[Kyrgyzstan is on the 2nd place after the Russia
for the numbers of anthrax cases. This report
does not tell about the spread of disease in the
country but is a definite marker of it. The last
report on anthrax in Kyrgyzstan came in Promed
correspondence in December 2006. The location of
that human case was the same region as now. ï¿½ Mod.NR]

[This region in the west of Kyrgyzstan is a
severely afflicted area for anthrax, as you can
see by the frequency of ProMED reports citing it.
And the disease does not respect borders as it continues west into Uzbekistan.
