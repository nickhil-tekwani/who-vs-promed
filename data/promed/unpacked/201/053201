The person in charge of vectors of the Bermejo Health Coordinator, Silvia Choquevilca, reported that 5 positive cases of hantavirus [infection] were confirmed in the El Tigre community, in the municipality of Padcaya, Tarija, after the death of one person.

Of 17 samples analysed, 12 cases in total have been discounted. There is still an alert in this area and its surrounding communities.

"In coordination with the person in charge of Zoonosis and the technical staff of the health coordinator, a [epidemiological] blockade is being carried out in the area where these cases occurred. It is really worrying, the person in charge of the Valle Dorado health center has already been informed, so that they can control people, since if they present symptoms, they must act quickly. We will meet constantly to evaluate the situation," said Choquevilca.

In the communities belonging to the municipality of Padcaya, such as Valle Dorado, El Caj√≥n, El Tigre, Santa Clara and Playa Ancha in the department of Tarija where agriculture is carried out, it is indicated that the rodents that transmit the illness [virus] could be present. He asked the population of these sectors to take precautionary measures.

"However, it is important that people learn to take care of themselves by taking precautionary measures in these areas, such as cleaning the areas where rodents occur, and those who fish must also be very careful in the localities where they go."

[A 7 Jul 2022 report (see Hantavirus - Americas (21): Bolivia (TR) 20220708.8704291) indicated that there were 4 cases of hantavirus infection in Tarija. Apparently, there is an additional one bringing the total number of positives to 5. Cases of hantavirus infections in Tarija department are not new. Tarija department is endemic for hantaviruses, and cases occur there sporadically. In 2018, there were 11 cases. The previously reported 2015 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) that occurred in Tarija department were confirmed. As noted in the previous comments, earlier cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been reported from tropical, lowland areas of Bolivia, including 7 cases in Tarija during 2014. The specific hantaviruses involved in these or previous cases in Bolivia were not given.

In the lowland Amazon Basin of Bolivia, the rodent hosts of the hantavirus that might be involved in these hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases, with their images, include the following:
- Laguna Negra virus (small vesper mouse, _Calomys laucha_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/calomyslaucha.html and large vesper mouse, _C. callosus_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/calomyscallosus.html);
- Bermejo (Chaco rice rat, _Oligoryzomys chacoensis_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/oligorizomyschacoensis.html); and
- Oran (long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _O. longicaudatus_ http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1203.jpeg).

Since previous cases in Tarija department have occurred in Bermejo, perhaps Bermejo hantavirus was involved.

Dr Jan Clement commented earlier that there is a need to be able to differentiate Seoul orthohantavirus (SEOV) as a causative agent, but that is hampered by the fact that most current commercial ELISA or WB formats no longer contain a SEOV antigen, so that a preliminary presumption of a hantavirus infection can even be missed in non-research laboratories (https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/222/8/1311/5850525 and Reynes JM, Carli D, Bour JB et al. Seoul virus infection in humans, France, 2014-2016. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(6): 973-7; https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/6/16-0927_article)

SEOV is widely distributed around the world in the brown rat and is likely found in Tarija department. - Mod.TY
