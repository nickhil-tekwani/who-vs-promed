It strikes me that their conclusions are premature. How do we know that the
_E.coli_ are not responding to the presence of the adenoma & carcinoma and
somehow are now able to adhere to the mucosa. Thus "adherence" is a litmus
test for one of these conditions.
I would be much more impressed if adherence had been noted BEFORE the
adenoma & carcinoma were found.

This is a chicken vs. egg issue...

Was it considered that the presence of colorectal cancer promoted the
growth of _E. coli_, rather than the causative factor to cancer?
