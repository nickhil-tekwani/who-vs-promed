California is currently experiencing a whooping cough [pertussis] epidemic, according to the California Department of Public Health. Public health officials said more than 800 new cases have been reported in the last 2 weeks.

Some 3458 cases of whooping cough had been reported to the health department this year as of June 10 2019 - more cases than were reported in all of 2013, according to department officials.

Health officials said whooping cough is cyclical and that cases peak every 3 to 5 years. The last peak was in 2010, so this year [2019] could be another peak year, officials say.

Reports of whooping cough cases in Blaine County were confirmed by local health officials Thursday afternoon [20 Jun 2019].

In a media release posted to the Blaine County Health Department Facebook page [https://www.facebook.com/blainecountyhealthdepartment/photos/a.1541451082808457/2406512599635630], an official with the department corroborated that several cases had been reported in the county. According to the release, the department is currently working with local healthcare providers "to identify and appropriately treat cases and contacts based on recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS)."

Blaine County includes the town of Chinook and is adjacent to Hill and Choteau counties. It has a population size of over 6600.

370 cases of whooping cough, also known as pertussis, have been identified in the state of Montana since 1 Jan 2019, Montana DPHHS data shows. That number is up from 28 reported whooping cough cases by this time in 2018. According to the Montana DPHHS website, 17 counties have reported cases of whooping cough so far this year.

The most up-to-date information listed on the Montana DPHHS website [https://dphhs.mt.gov/Portals/85/publichealth/documents/CDEpi/StatisticsandReports/CurrentActivity/MontanaPertussisSummary.pdf] confirms 3 cases of whooping cough in Blaine County. An official with Blaine County Health Department would not, however, specify as to the exact number of confirmed cases in the area.

The Sudbury Health Unit is alerting the public to increased reports of whooping cough in the area. 12 whooping cough, or pertussis infections have been reported so far in 2019, Public Health Sudbury & Districts said in a press release. The health unit said the disease goes unreported, especially among teens and adults who don't often seek health care for symptoms.

The health unit adds that infections tend to occur in cycles, with peaks occurring every 2 to 5 years. The last local peak in the Sudbury area was 2015, when 27 cases were reported.

Vaccinations are offered free of charge to infants, children, and adolescents, the health unit said, and is required for school attendance. Fully vaccinated adults can still get the infection due to decreased immunity over time, however, are unlikely to experience severe symptoms.

For more information about pertussis and vaccination, visit https://www.phsd.ca or call Public Health Sudbury & Districts at 705.522.9200 (toll-free 1.866.522.9200) ext. 301.

Northern Ireland has seen a significant increase this year in cases of whooping cough. The Public Health Agency (PHA) recorded 44 cases to [19 Jun 2019], compared to 16 reported during the same period last year [2018].

Just over 1/5 were in infants under 6 months of age and so too young to be protected by their routine childhood immunisations. The PHA urged pregnant women here to receive the vaccine between 16 and 32 weeks of their pregnancy.

A spokesman said: "Whooping cough continues to circulate in Northern Ireland and every 3 to four 4 it is normal to see increased activity, which is what we are experiencing this year [2019]. It is therefore really important that women receive the pertussis vaccine during every pregnancy so that their baby is protected against whooping cough in their 1st months of life."

This Wednesday morning [3 Jul 2019], several parents in Cote-d'Or [Burgundy-Franche-Comte/Dijon] attending a welcoming ceremony for children in the institutions infancy and schools of Fontaine-les-Dijon received a briefing note from the Regional Health Agency (ARS) of Burgundy-Franche-Comte (BFC). This message indicated that "several cases of whooping cough have been reported for children attending a kindergarten school in Fontaine-les-Dijon, some of whom attend the Les Saverney leisure center. This bacterial respiratory disease is very contagious and likely to cause complications, especially in the most fragile (infants, people with respiratory diseases. or immunosuppressed). It requires the implementation of measures to prevent its spread.

The ARS BFC added that as a precaution, it advised parents to: "Check, with the help of your doctor, that your child is well vaccinated against whooping cough and if necessary, have the vaccine updated by the doctor; Check with your doctor if your child has a cough by reporting this situation of group cases of whooping cough."

In detail, the ARS BFC, contacted on this subject on [Wed 3 Jul 2019], told us that "since the end of May [2019], 9 confirmed cases of pertussis" have been reported to him "among the students of the nursery school of the Portfolios of Fontaine-les-Dijon and Les Saverney leisure center. The institution continued: "Children have benefited from medical treatment adapted to this respiratory disease caused by a bacterium, responsible for frequent and prolonged coughing spells. No cases have been reported in other schools or recreation of Fontaine-les-Dijon."

Doctors across the southwest are on alert as the region suffers its worst outbreak of whooping cough in recent history. So far this year [2019], the South West Hospital and Health Service has come across 21 cases of whooping cough (pertussis), up from zero cases in 2017 and only 3 by this time last year [2018].

Most of the outbreaks have been in schools around the southwest, and cases have been recorded in schools on the Darling Downs as well.

"Symptoms of whooping cough vary but typically start out like a cold with a runny nose with sneezing, tiredness, and characteristic coughing bouts developing over several days," Darling Downs Public Health Unit acting director Dr Katie Panaretto said. "In teens and adults, the infection may cause a persistent cough, but for babies and young children, whooping cough can be life-threatening."

"If you or a family member have these symptoms, it's important to go to the GP or local health centre and be tested," Dr Panaretto said. "Call ahead to explain you think you might have whooping cough and follow any infection control measures you're advised of. In the meantime, stay away from others, particularly babies who aren't protected until they have received 3 vaccinations at 6 months of age, and pregnant women."

In response to the spike in both diseases, health authorities are reminding every resident to make sure their vaccinations are up to date. The whooping cough vaccine is still offered through the National Immunisation Program, meaning pregnant women, and children of certain ages can get the jabs for free. "Since this program was introduced to Australia, there has been a drop in severe disease and deaths from whooping cough," Dr Panaretto said.
