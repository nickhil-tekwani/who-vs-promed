This past Monday [30 Mar 2015], 2 new cases of [a] hantavirus [infection] were confirmed in Los Santos province, bringing to 11 the number of affected people in the Azuero region so far this year [2015].

The individuals are 2 women, one 26 years old and the other 46 years old, who were taken to the Joaquin Pablo Franco Sayas Hospital with symptoms of [hantavirus] cardiopulmonary syndrome [HPS]. They were admitted to the intensive care unit, where they are in delicate condition.

Health authorities reported that they are carrying out inspections of the residences of the affected women, as well as different points in the region.

The 1st case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in Cocle was confirmed yesterday [31 Mar 2015] by the Ministry of Health. The individual is a 50-year-old woman resident in the El Limon community in the Capellania township in the Nata de los Caballeros district.

The epidemiologist, Domisio Espino, explained that a week ago the patient was admitted to the Rafael Estevez Hospital in Aguadulce and is in intensive care. "Health personnel went to the place [where the patient was from] to inspect the houses and carry out prevention activities in the community," he said.

He called for the people to avoid throwing out trash or leftover food around their houses since this attracts the field rodents that transmit this dangerous disease [virus].

[These results are not surprising. There have been several HPS cases in the Azuero region that includes Los Santos and Herrera provinces, both of which have had HPS cases this year (2015). Cocle province adjoins Herrera province. This region is endemic for Choclo hantavirus. So far this year, there have been 4 HPS cases reported from Herrera province and 11 from Los Santos province. Neither the above reports of these cases nor of previous cases indicate which hantavirus is responsible. Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS.

The preventive measures indicated in the above report include elimination of sites attractive to rodents. Although not stated in the above reports, residents should avoid the creation of aerosols of materials contaminated with rodent excreta with the virus when cleaning, especially in closed spaces. The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.
