Two patients have been identified with Malaria Tropica (_Plasmodium falciparum_) in the greater Rhein-Main region around Frankfurt, Germany. Both patients have a regular occupation at Frankfurt international airport and do not have a history of travel to a malaria endemic region nor of blood transfusions.

Both patients developed symptomatic disease on 5 Jul 2022. The 1st patient was rostered for work at the airport from 28 Jun until 4 Jul 2022, the 2nd was last rostered on 1 and 2 Jul 2022. In both cases, the diagnosis was made on 12 Jul 2022. One of the patients fulfills the criteria for severe malaria and is under critical care.

The patients did not work in overlapping areas at the airport. The responsible health authorities and occupational medicine departments were informed to possibly identify further febrile diseases in airport workers.

Autochthonous cases of malaria that were associated with airports were recently described in Brussels, Belgium in 2020, where 2 patients living within 5 km [3 mi] had died and plasmodia were found to be inherited from the same ancestor (1).

In October 2019, a cluster of 2 airport-associated infections with _P. falciparum_ were identified at Frankfurt airport. Both patients survived but one was critically ill.

The current cases as well as those described in the literature show that these patients affected by airport-associated malaria had a remarkably high disease severity. This is probably due to the relatively late initiation of treatment given the difficulty of diagnosing malaria without an epidemiological link to a malaria-endemic country.

[ProMED thanks Drs Kessel and Wolf for their submission, which is a useful reminder of the rare but persistent phenomenon of so-called airport malaria, which occurs when _Plasmodium_-infected mosquitos are passively transported by plane from malaria-endemic areas to non-endemic areas.

As stated by the authors, the morbidity and mortality of such infections are undoubtedly increased because local clinicians fail to consider the possibility of imported live mosquitos as a disease risk factor. Even a good travel history of a patient might omit the question, "Have you been to an international airport within the last 2 weeks?" When missed by physicians, such cases may be picked up by an astute hematology laboratory technician who notices abnormal intraerythrocytic trophozoites on a conventional Wright-Giemsa stain of a peripheral blood smear -- hence the value of ordering a manual rather than machine-automated white blood cell differential count in patients with severe but unexplained febrile illnesses.
