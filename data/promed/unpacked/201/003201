----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuberculosis (TB) is a well-recognised disease of South American
camelids in the UK, with an increasing number of farms being affected
in recent years. Clinical signs are varied and may include malaise,
illthrift, and respiratory signs. Postmortem lesions are predominantly
found in the lungs and associated lymph nodes, but can occasionally be
found in other tissues including the liver, pleura, kidney, and
mesenteric lymph nodes.

We would like to report the identification of TB in the mammary gland
of an alpaca, which has implications for potential disease spread and
zoonotic risk to owners and animal handlers, including veterinarians.

An 8-year-old female alpaca was euthanased and presented to the Animal
Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA)-Shrewsbury for
postmortem examination after a period of illthrift with respiratory
signs, which were unresponsive to treatment by the private veterinary
surgeon, and a discharging sinus involving the left quarter of the
mammary gland. Gross postmortem examination identified multiple
caseous lesions consistent with a diagnosis of mycobacterial disease
in the lungs, liver, lymph nodes, kidney, omentum, and pericardium.
The udder contained multiple variable-sized abscesses. The
supramammary lymph nodes and accessory superficial lymph nodes were
enlarged with multifocal caseous material.

_Mycobacterium bovis_, spoligotype 17 (international type SB0263), the
predominant local spoligotype [see comment below], was isolated from
the affected lymph nodes. Histopathology of the lung, lymph node,
kidney, liver, and mammary gland identified multifocal coagulative
necrosis surrounded by large numbers of degenerate leucocytes, small
numbers of activated macrophages, and fibroblasts. Ziehl-Neelsen
staining identified moderate to large numbers of acid-fast bacilli in
all tissues. These findings are consistent with disseminated _M.
bovis_ infection including mastitis.

TB in the mammary gland of cattle has been recognised for many years,
and before pasteurisation was carried out routinely, it was the source
of infection for many human cases.

In the majority of cases of TB in alpacas, the source of infection is
thought to be spillover of infection from other animals such as cattle
and wildlife. Suspected alpaca-to-alpaca transmission has been
reported [see ProMED-mail 20090730.2667]. It is assumed that the
offspring of dams with mycobacterial infections will be exposed to _M.
bovis_ as a result of close contact, predominantly through the
oronasal route. The considerable number of acid-fast bacilli in the
mammary gland in this case strongly suggested that milk from this
animal would have contained sufficient numbers of the organism to
result in the infection of offspring. This demonstrates the potential
for direct exposure to _M. bovis_ via milk and possible spread to
other herds via movement of crias [*] before the development of
clinical signs. This alpaca was not lactating on submission; however,
its cria born in 2010 had died at a young age and its death was not
investigated. [*Cria: a baby camelid such as a llama, alpaca, vicuna,
or guanaco; from Spanish for "baby"].

The owners and attending veterinary surgeon involved in this case had
regularly flushed the discharging lesion, possibly creating bacterial
aerosols. We would urge colleagues to be aware of the potential of TB
in udder lesions of alpacas, and to consider the associated risk
involved in the treatment of such lesions.

Spoligotyping (spacer oligonucleotide typing), a polymerase chain
reaction-based amplification of a region of the mycobacterial genome,
is recognised as a rapid and reliable test for the differentiation
between _M. bovis_ and other mycobacteria.

On 17 Aug 2011, UK's Agricultural Departments published a joint
announcement, accompanying the national statistics on the incidence of
TB in cattle in Great Britain, covering the period January-May 2011.
The most recent statistical notice and dataset can be downloaded at
http://www.defra.gov.uk/statistics/files/defra-stats-foodfarm-landuselivestock-tb-statsnotice-110817.pdf.

The announcement mentioned the following key points:
1. The provisional May 2011 estimate lies above the incidence rate for
May 2010. However, care needs to be taken not to read too much into a
single month's figure, especially as this figure includes a high
number of unclassified incidents. As such the incidence rates are
subject to further revisions as more tests and their results are
input.
2. Provisional statistics show a 6.4 percent increase in the number of
new TB incidents in January-May 2011 compared to the same period in
2010. Combined with a decrease in the number of herds tested over the
same period, this equates to a provisional overall increase in the TB
incidence rate (new TB incidents, as a proportion of tests on OTF*
herds) of 7.4 percent.
3. The provisional average incidence rate for herds where OTF status
was withdrawn (OTFW**, as a proportion of tests on OTF herds) was 3.8
percent for January-May 2011, compared to 3.7 percent for the same
period in 2010.
*OTF: officially TB free herds.
**OTFW: new herd incidents with OTF status withdrawn.

Cases of bovine tuberculosis in domestic animals other than cattle in
the UK have shown a clear increase in the UK in recent years. These
involved deer, goats, pigs, cats, dogs, alpacas, llamas, and sheep. -
