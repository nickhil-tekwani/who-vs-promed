A pig disease has occurred in some mid-sized and small farms and
farming households in some parts of China's South this summer. A
spokesperson from the News Office of China's Ministry of Agriculture
said today that the number of cases has already been substantially
reduced and the disease situation is easing.
This kind of pig disease is mainly characterized by high fever and is
called "Pig High Fever Disease." In recent years during the hot and
humid season, it has appeared numerous times in regions of the South.
After the disease outbreak, the Ministry of Agriculture sent expert
teams and work teams to disease-affected regions to diagnose the
disease and guide local prevention and control work. Laboratory
tests have ruled out zoonotic disease. At the same time, using
OIE-recommended detection methods, African Swine Fever has been ruled
out.
The Ministry of Agriculture requests that all locales organize
veterinary personnel to go deep into local areas to guide farming
households in disinfection, isolation, and other comprehensive
prevention and control measures, and undertake immunization against
identified pathogens.

Yesterday, the provincial government held an urgent, province-wide
videoteleconference [the province in question is Hubei; see URL for
map below] on prevention and control of serious animal diseases,
demanding fast action from all parts of the province, paying special
attention to prevention and control work against the unknown pig high
fever illness, to ensure increased agricultural efficacy and
increased farmer receipts.
Since the middle of July 2006, an unknown pig disease has occurred in
the neighboring provinces of Anhui, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Hunan and
Henan, and other areas. Already 40 percent of pigs have died from
infection. As of mid-August this disease had already spread to parts
of Hubei. Conditions are relatively serious. According to reports,
the pig disease is characterized by high fever, sudden onset, rapid
transmission, and high mortality rate.
Municipal Government Secretary Yan Xinguo participated in the
conference. He requested all districts of the city to heighten
awareness, formulate vigorous measures, organize with utmost care,
strengthen monitoring, and pay attention to disease trends at all
times. Relevant departments must carry out legal inspections of pig
transports and conscientiously strengthen the intensity of
inspections at border inspection spots. Animal husbandry and other
relevant departments must strengthen market supervision, firmly deal
with disease, and strengthen oversight against disease during
production, slaughter and sale. Once high fever pig illness of
unknown origin is discovered, immediately file reports, quickly
undertake safe disposal, strictly disinfect, work hard against the
sale of dead diseased pigs and pigs that have died of unknown causes,
and ensure the safety of meat on the market. Relevant departments
must suspend purchase of pigs from disease-affected areas to prevent
the spread of pig disease. While prevention and control of unknown
high fever pig disease is being accomplished, strictly watch for
other animal diseases and thoroughly plan prevention and control work
for other serious animal diseases. Organize specialized teams to
supervise disease inspection to ensure substantial progress on
disease prevention in the fall.

Recently, the circumstances of pig "high fever illness" have been
relatively severe. In response, Jiangshan is adopting measures to
actively implement prevention and treatment. [Jiangshan -- a common
city name, occurring in several Chinese provinces -- is in this case
a municipality within the larger Quzhou City, situated in the western
part of Zhejiang Province. - CopyEd.PG]
Pig "high fever illness" is appearing in all areas in our province
[Zhejiang] other than Zhoushan City. There are more than 66 000 ill
pigs and already more than 11 000 have died. Since July, pig "high
fever illness" has appeared in one village after the other in
Jiangshan. Symptoms are elevated body temperature, redness on the
body surface, and cough. Ears turn light blue in a minority of pigs.
The mortality rate among sucklings and weaned pigs is especially
high. To effectively carry out prevention of pig "high fever
illness", the municipal agriculture department strengthens disease
inspection and safe disposal of deceased ill pigs, and guides
pig-raising households to lower temperatures in pigsties, reducing
the occurrence of disease.
On the morning of 4 Sep 2006, Jiangshan held a pig "high fever
illness" prevention meeting. Vice mayor Xu Daqing demanded
heightened attention to pig "high fever illness" and thorough
implementation of all prevention and control measures, including
sealing off and isolating disease sites, strengthening hygiene and
disinfection, and reducing movement of pigs. At this time, traders
are prohibited from importing breeding pigs from other provinces and
cities to strictly prevent disease from entering Jiangshan and to
ensure the efficacy of disease prevention work.

[Our first posting referred to Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hunan,
Hubei, Jiangsu, and other provinces. Today's reports additionally
mention Jiangshan City in Zheijiang province and Henan province (see
<http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c9/China_administrative.png>).
Given the reports of over a million dead pigs, many of which appear
to be in village settings, the disease is clearly widespread.
Secondly, death is reported to occur in over 40 percent of pigs,
definitely making this a high-mortality event.
The big question is what disease is causing such widespread mortality
in swine? Clearly, "high fever" or "blue ear" disease is not a
diagnosis, rather they are signs of an undiagnosed and seemingly
systemic disease. "Blue ear" was used by Europeans as a slang name
early on for the recently emerged Porcine Respiratory and
Reproductive Disease, but this does not generally cause such
widespread mortality among all age groups. Discoloration of the skin
can be seen in several swine diseases including erysipelas and
salmonellosis.
Such high mortality and the widespread nature of this outbreak -- as
well as the control measures instituted -- prompts one to think of
epidemic swine diseases such as Hog Cholera (as known as Classical
Swine Fever) or African Swine Fever. However, I hope that the Chinese
authorities are carefully considering the possibility of Swine
Influenza usually caused by H1N1, H1N2, or H3N2 in Asia. Although
Swine Influenza does not normally cause very high mortality (i.e.
only 2-3 percent die when the disease is endemic), a new influenza
strain could cause high mortality in swine, just as it would in
humans. Therefore, it is important we find out exactly what is
causing this undefined, undiagnosed disease over large areas of
China. - Mod.PC]
