begomovirus

Why: Tomato yellow mosaic begomovirus came to our attention as causing an
emerging disease of tomato in the Americas. The disease was first reported
in Venezuela in 1963 as a virus transmitted by _Bemisia tabaci_.
Where: Venezuela. The VIDE database mentions its presence in Brazil (as
mosaico dourado do tomateiro which is also the disease name of tomato
golden mosaic begomovirus in Brazil?)
On which plants: Tomatoes (_Lycopersicon esculentum_). Natural infection
has once been reported in potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) causing up to 70%
losses in potato cv. Sebago (Debrot & Centeno, 1985). Weeds like
_Lycopersicon esculentum var. cerasiforme_ and _L. pimpinellifolium_ are
reported as natural hosts.
Damage: Symptoms are a golden yellow mosaic and stunting. No fruit is
produced if plants are infected early. It is reported that tomato yellow
mosaic has caused millions of dollar losses in tomato commercial fields in
Venezuela. By the time of flowering, 90-100% of tomato plants could become
infected by the virus (Piven et al., 1995).
Transmission: Transmitted by _Bemisia tabaci_. Note: It is not clear
whether tomato yellow mosaic in Venezuela and tomato golden mosaic in
Brazil are caused by distinct begomoviruses. Relationships between tomato
yellow mosaic and potato yellow mosaic begomoviruses are not known.
Pathway: Infected tomato plants, fruits?, viruliferous _B. tabaci_ from
countries where tomato yellow mosaic begomovirus occurs.
Possible risks: Tomato is an important crop in the EPPO region, both indoor
and outdoor and the virus vector is present in many parts of the EPPO
region. The disease is causing problems on tomato in Venezuela but the
situation on potato is not clear. Data is also lacking on the relationships
of this virus with other begomoviruses of tomato.
