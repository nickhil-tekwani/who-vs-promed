The Ohio Division of Wildlife is reporting a fish kill in the Cuyahoga River. About 2000 dead fish, mostly minnows, suckers, and carp, were found by investigators this past weekend [18-19 Aug 2012]. The fish were in a fairly advanced state of decomposition, according to a source.

The area affected is an approximately 3-mile stretch of water starting just north of the Akron Sewage Treatment Plant to Bolanz Road, the home of Szalay's Farm and Market.

The cause of the kill is under investigation by the Ohio EPA. Water tests now show no toxins present at this time and ample dissolved oxygen for fish and other aquatic life.
