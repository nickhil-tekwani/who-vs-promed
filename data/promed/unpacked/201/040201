In your recent posting on the detection of CWD (Chronic Wasting
Disease) in a specimen submitted by a hunter from a free-ranging mule
deer [ref. above, reference was made to a Nebraska Game and Parks
Commission Press Release about the occurrence of CWD in a captive
herd of deer in Western Nebraska.
The posting stated "Last week, the Nebraska Department of Agriculture
and APHIS (Animal, Plant and Health Inspection Service) ordered a
captive herd in northern Cheyenne County be destroyed after a third
case of the disease was confirmed there."
To clarify, the Nebraska Bureau of Animal Industry and United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA), APHIS, Veterinary Services did
not order the destruction of the affected herd. While the USDA, State
agricultural officials, State wildlife officials, and the animal agricultural
industries are very much concerned about CWD in captive and free-
ranging cervids, currently, there is no official USDA program on CWD
under which quarantine and an order for destruction could be
authorized.
In Nebraska, CWD is reportable, there is a program for surveillance,
there are quarantine rules, and there is a voluntary monitoring program.
There is no indemnification program for owners of infected cervids
from the State or from APHIS. However, the affected herd was
purchased by the USDA for research purposes and to ensure infected
or exposed deer would not be used for human consumption.
USDA is very concerned about the movement of CWD from Colorado
and Wyoming to other States. While free-ranging cervids are not
within the assigned mission of the USDA, we are working
cooperatively with wildlife agencies. We are currently reviewing
options that would permit an official USDA response to this emerging
animal disease threat in farmed cervids.
