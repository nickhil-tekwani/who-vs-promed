China teams up with international wheat body to fight African disease
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences [CAAS] signed an
agreement on Tuesday [4 Dec 2007] to cooperate on research with the
International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) to fight
against a new subspecies of wheat stem rust. The 3 million U.S.
dollars project involves testing several thousand wheat samples
provided by both sides. There will be screening for disease-resistant
[wheat] strains from Africa where the new subspecies of the major
cereal disease originated.

It is believed the new wheat stem rust subspecies, which is dubbed
"Ug99" and has already spread to the Middle East, would most likely
encroach into major Asian wheat production areas.

Shi Yanquan, deputy head of the science and education department at
the Agriculture Ministry, said at the signing ceremony that it would
take 3 years to complete the project. He added China had cooperated
with CIMMYT for more than 3 decades.

Wheat stem rust occurs worldwide wherever wheat is grown. The disease
often causes severe loss of crops, usually between 50 to 70 percent,
over a large area. In many cases, individual fields can be totally
destroyed. Damage is greatest when the disease becomes severe before
the grain is completely formed.

[Wheat stem rust is caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp.
_tritici_. It occurs worldwide throughout wheat producing areas.
Symptoms are dark orange pustules on the stems and also on the
leaves. Stems can be completely girdled by the pustules damaging the
conducting tissue and preventing grain fill. Yield losses of up to 70
percent are reported, but some fields are totally destroyed. If stem
rust arrives early in the growing cycle, losses are higher. The
fungus is spread by wind and with infected straw.

New pathogen races are emerging with increased virulence against
genes previously used for resistance breeding. Considered most
dangerous at present is strain Ug99 which was first reported in
Uganda in 1999. Recurring epidemics in Kenya and then Ethiopia
followed and it has recently spread to Yemen. It may also be present
in Pakistan, Sudan, and Tanzania and appears to be moving on prevailing winds.

Ug99 can infect and cause disease in many commonly grown stem rust
"resistant" wheat lines. In much of the world, resistance to stem
rust in wheat is based at least in part on the gene Sr31. High levels
of stem rust infection were observed on wheat lines in a nursery at
Kalengyere Research Station in Uganda. Because several of the
diseased lines contained the Sr31, Lr26, and Yr9 genes for rust
resistance, a new strain with virulence to Sr31 was suspected.

Ug99 is considered a significant threat to global wheat production.
To combat Ug99 worldwide, countries need to increase vigilance,
establish efficient monitoring and surveillance systems, use
certified seed, develop resistant varieties suitable for their
region, and develop contingency plans in case of an outbreak. The
international Global Rust Initiative was set up which is lead by
CIMMYT and the International Center for Agricultural Research in the
Dry Areas (ICARDA) and was also joined by FAO (United Nations Food
and Agricultural Organisation). CIMMYT has a long established
partnership with Chinese cereal geneticists, and if new wheat lines
with resistance to Ug99 can be developed these will be of significant
benefit to wheat growers worldwide. A focus on resistance screening
of African germplasm is suggested because this is the region of
origin of Ug99, and host resistance is most likely to be found
co-evolving with an emerging new pathogen strain.

CIMMYT (Mexico City) and ICARDA (Aleppo, Syria) belong to the
Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), a
partnership of countries, international and regional organisations
and private foundations supporting the work of 15 international
research centers.
