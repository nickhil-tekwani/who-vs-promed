The number of confirmed cases of dengue fever doubled in the month
following the deadly 29 Sep [2009] tsunami that inundated this U.S.
territory in the South Pacific.

Dr. Aloiamoa Anesi, chief medical officer at LBJ Tropical Medical
Center, said American Samoa's only hospital in October confirmed 62
cases and the territory's 1st 2 deaths of 2009 from the mosquito-borne
disease. "This is a definite increase from September figures (27
confirmed cases) as predicted with post-tsunami outdoor living for a
lot of affected villagers," Anesi said. "The rainy days we have mean
more breeding places for mosquitoes as we still have a lot of debris
after the tsunami disaster," he added.

Between 1 Jan - 31 Oct [2009], there were 373 confirmed cases of
dengue in American Samoa.

Dengue causes joint pain, high fevers, nausea and a rash. In severe
cases, it causes internal bleeding and can lead to death. The virus is
most commonly spread by mosquitoes that have contracted it after
biting infected humans.

<http://www.jornaldigital.com/noticias.php?noticia=20042>


The Cape Verde Government is considering declaring a state of calamity
in view of the dengue epidemic which gripped the country since
September [2009] and is expanding rapidly and alarmingly. The latest
official data from this outbreak are noted to be approximately 9000
people infected by dengue virus, including 25 suffering from DHF,
which has resulted in 6 [fatal] victims.

Measures are being taken and the Government announced that the country
already has a laboratory in a position to confirm dengue infections.
The Government also announced the import of new drugs and equipment,
with a view to creating conditions for treatment in the country.

To cope with this calamity, the Government of Cape Verde declared a
national work recess on Fri 6 Nov [2009], as a way to involve the
whole society, public and private institutions, military, educational
establishments and all the population in a national campaign against
the mosquito vector of this disease.

Prime Minister Jose Maria Neves has announced the availability of
financial allocation to combating the disease, while soliciting
support from countries such as Portugal, Brazil, Spain and Cuba to
help fight dengue. Also, doctors and health workers already retired
have been recruited while hospitals and health centers are full of
patients. Most of the islands already note that the supply of stock
repellents and paracetamol in pharmacies is exhausted.

The situation has worsened, and the Bishop of the Dioceses of 2 Cape
Verde [islands] -- Santiago and Sao Vicente -- Dom Arlindo Furtado, is
calling for people to join this fight against the pandemic. The
various football championships have been postponed, since most of the
athletes are affected by dengue.

The schools, as well as institutions are working "half-throttle," so
this fight against the disease has been extended to diplomatic
missions in Cape Verde. The ambassador of the United States in Cape
Verde has already established contacts with health facilities in that
country to collaborate with Cape Verde in combating the epidemic.

[Dengue virus type 3 is circulating in the Cape Verde islands. The 5
Nov 2008 edition of Afrol News (in Portuguese)
(<http://www.afrol.com/es/articulos/34633>) reported that authorities
have urged citizens to kill mosquitoes, instead of going to work,
while police and the army try to eradicate the disease. The epidemic
has reached the archipelago as a rude awakening, where this tropical
disease has never been recorded before, and it has spread like
wildfire. Registered infections are increasing at a record pace of
1000 infections per day.

The latest figures as published in Praia are 8799 cases of which 851
are in the capital. Yesterday (5 Nov 2009), the Cape Verde government
had no choice but to send a warning to tourists to take extra
precautions due to the epidemic. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of
Portugal -- which represents one of the most important tourist markets
in Cape Verde -- has already issued a warning to Portuguese citizens
who plan to travel to Cape Verde. For the archipelago, a blow to the
tourism industry could bring significant economic consequences.
Tourism has become the backbone of the economic boom in Cape Verde.
The archipelago has a serious goal of becoming the "new Canary
Islands" off the coast of West Africa. With the emergence of tropical
diseases, mass tourism, however, does not seem very realistic.

Even with a rise in dengue cases, the Department of Health in Central
Visayas (DOH-7) said yesterday that there is no area hit by dengue
outbreak. "We are not conducting an entomological survey, we have not
seen the need for one. There is no outbreak," said Dr. Expedito
Medalla, DOH-7's Health Emergency Management Services coordinator. He
said the survey, which entails counting larvae and adult _Aedes
aegypti_, is only done when there is evidence of a large concentration
of the dengue-carrying vectors in an area.

According to the latest DOH-7 surveillance report, dengue cases went
up by 42 percent between 1 Jan - 24 Oct 2009 compared with the same
period last year [2008].

The top 10 towns or cities with the highest number of dengue cases
are: Cebu City, Lapu-Lapu City, Dumaguete City in Negros Oriental
province, Minglanilla town in southern Cebu, Mandaue City, Talisay
City, Naga City, Tagbilaran City in Bohol province, Danao city in Cebu
and Tanjay City in Negros Oriental.

[This report does not indicate the number of dengue cases that have
occurred so far in 2009. An increase of 42 percent over 2008 sounds
suspiciously like an outbreak, unless the number of cases is very
small compared to several previous years.

The Jakarta city administration warned that the number of dengue fever
cases might rise in the coming months. "Observing data from the last 2
years, dengue fever began to increase in December and reached its peak
in March [2009]," Dien Emawati, Jakarta Health Agency head, said at a
conference on dengue fever prevention. Dien explained the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito population rose when the wet season reached its
peak. "Areas covered with stagnant water increase and become breeding
grounds for mosquitoes," she said. Dien added that the agency was
preparing a massive fogging campaign this month.

The agency recorded that, as of October [presumably for all of 2009],
more than 26 500 Jakarta residents were suspected of having contracted
dengue fever. The fever claimed 33 lives.

A state health official urged Floridians on Tuesday [22 Sep 2009 ***
note date] to take precautions against dengue fever after 3 people
were found to have it. Health officials said all 3 people have since
fully recovered from the disease.

A health advisory was issued for Key West after a visitor from New
York visited the tourist destination in August [2009] and when she
returned home she started experiencing flulike symptoms. Her doctor
confirmed it was dengue fever. A husband and wife from Key West were
also found to have the illness.

Dengue fever is a flulike illness spread by the bite of an infected
Aedes mosquito. Carina Blackmore, state public health veterinarian,
said that the mosquito is found in high concentrations in South
Florida and the Keys.

Blackmore said it has been 40 years since officials have seen locally
acquired dengue fever. But dengue fever may have been in the
community, just not correctly diagnosed, she said. "We have been
expecting it," she said. "We just haven't picked it up." She said
experts believe it is a small localized outbreak that is not expected
to spread across Florida.

People should drain standing water in flower pots and bird baths, and
they should apply insect repellent.

[Health] authorities reported that this year [2009] the disease
[dengue] has increased 40 percent compared to 2008; just in October of
this year there were 10 000 cases. A vaccine will become available in
2014. The Secretariat of Health reported that this year [2009] dengue
spread to 27 states of the country, even among those which were
declared free of the disease transmitted by the mosquito vector, such
as Queretaro, Zacatecas and Guanajuato.

The most affected state is Nayarit; in 2008 there were 183 patients
and this year the number went to 3331, not counting the 2300 which are
counted as DHF. Especially striking is Queretaro, which had 5 probable
cases in 2008, now registers 85 [probable cases], and this year
documents [confirms?] 5. In Veracruz there was a considerable
increase, going from 1633 last year, to 2286 confirmed cases of
classical dengue fever [this year] and 1489 to 1902 DHF cases,
increases of 40 percent and 95 percent, respectively. [The numbers of
DHF cases cited above must be in error. That many DHF cases compared
to the number of reported classical dengue cases would be
extraordinarily high by at least an order of magnitude. Perhaps there
is a problem with dengue case classification. - Mod.TY]

The federal agency said that Mexico has recorded more than 35 000
cases and that the disease has grown by more than 40 percent over the
previous year [2008]. The Secretariat reported that during October
there were 10 000 cases going to 25 929 [total for 2009] during the
1st 2 weeks, then to 35 000 almost to the end of the month. So far,
only 5 deaths [have occurred]. In 2008, in this period, 24 782
patients were reported with this disease. In the case of DHF, which is
the most dangerous and fatal [of dengue] cases, there was an increase
of close to 15 percent, rising to 5162 confirmed cases as of early
October 2008, to 5907 in the same period of 2009. Epidemiological
Bulletin, prepared by the Unified Information System for
Epidemiological Surveillance, reported that 10 874 additional
infections were suspected.

Currently, Mexico is on alert and reinforced epidemiological
surveillance actions in facing the rapid and excessive increase of
cases, as a result of the transmitting mosquito vector [of the virus],
that is already adapted to all tropical climates, hot or cold
regardless of whether there is rain. In the past, the Health
Secretary, Jose Angel Cordova Villalobos, said that there was no fear
that there would be a flood of cases of dengue.

"There is a special or supplementary support from the federal
government in terms of inputs for spraying. In addition, each state is
doing a fine job and I think this is going to contain [dengue virus
transmission] soon. "We need a month and a half of a difficult period
[for the mosquito] and hope that the rains are letting up, are going
down," said the official. "We have a nation-wide problem," he said.
"The mosquito can live in places more than a 1500 meters [4900 ft]
above sea level and certainly makes us reinforce support of trash
removal measures in homes. With this said, avoid [harboring] areas
where water accumulates and implement abate treatment to kill larvae
and apply insecticides," he said.

The change in the way that Environmental Monitoring of the Federal
District works is considered by the agency is one of the main factors
that contributed to the decrease in dengue cases confirmed in the
federal capital in 2009. The reduction was 29.3 percent, from January
- October this year [2009]. For cases reported, the decrease reached
53.3 percent. Even with the positive numbers, a person died of dengue
this year in the city of San Sebastian.

There were 399 confirmed cases, 271 (68 percent) of transmission
within the DF [Federal District] and 128 (32 percent) in other states.
In 2008, 564 people had a confirmed diagnosis of dengue; 274
contracted the disease in the Federal District and 290 in other
regions of Brazil. In the Federal District, 20 states managed to
reduce the dengue picture. Reported numbers of dengue cases up to
August exceeded 406 000 in the whole country.

For the Secretary of Health Surveillance of the DF, Disney Antezana,
disclosure biweekly data for the presence of mosquitoes in areas of
higher risk was essential to prevent disease [virus] transmission.
"Previously, infection rates were brought to our attention every 3
months. This [delay] complicated action. However, the fact is that now
we act now almost in real time, especially in confirmed cases," says
Antezana. The change began in November 2008.

Activities incorporated into the Regional Administrations, the Office
of Urban Sanitation (SLU), the coordinating body of the parks and the
Federal District Department of Education also contributed to the
reduction of the presence of the vector, in the evaluation of Health
Surveillance. "Every month, we have implemented activities in schools
and volunteer work in cities, which helps us a lot," says the
Subsecretary.

Even with the reduction of dengue cases, Rosely Cerqueira, the
Director of the Board of the Environmental Monitoring of the
Secretariat of Health, warned to the population, "There is a constant
possibility of risk in every home. [Residents] should always observe
if the garbage is poorly packaged, if there is accumulation of water
in objects, drains, swimming pools, areas with kennels, and garages.
That is, everything that facilitates mosquito breeding.

Nationally, according to totals of the Ministry of Health, the dengue
cases in Brazil fell 46.3 percent in the 1st 30 weeks of 2009,
compared to the same period of 2008 (January-August). Reported cases
[so far in 2009] were 406 883, versus 758 051 in 2008. The reduction
was observed in 20 states and the Federal District. The states of
Acre, Amapa, Bahia, Espirito Santo, Mato Grosso do Sul and Mato Grosso
showed an increased number of cases. The totals also show a partial
reduction of 63.2 percent in deaths. By 1 Aug [2009], there were 166
deaths, 103 of DHF and 63 of dengue with complications. In the same
period last year, 451 deaths were recorded (213 of DHF and 238 of
dengue with complications).

The national campaign against dengue began on Wednesday (4 Nov
[2009]). With the arrival of rain earlier in Brasilia, the capital
campaign began in September.

Bahia is the state that had the largest number of dengue victims in
2009, according to the Ministry of Health; 66 people have died. In
Itabuna, in the south of the state, work to combat foci of the
mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ is not stopping, but the Public Ministry
warns of a new epidemic in the city.

The work, began in early November [2009], has been to establish data
from rapid survey sampling. The 58 districts of Itabuna will go
through this service. 20 percent of homes will be visited by agents.
The larvae collected are taken to the laboratory of the Dengue Central
Support Point. With microscopes, the agents make the identification of
the mosquito [larvae].

A problem in the city are the canals. One of them, in the district of
Sao Caetano, is full of weeds and a lot of garbage. "We have a high
risk of having more deaths in the city. We have proposed changes in
this process. Now, we need the government and the community to do
their tasks," the prosecutor Clodoaldo announced.

According to the city of Itabuna, cleaning the canals is already being
done and tomorrow there will be a seminar in the city, with government
representatives, health professionals and of justice to discuss
strategies to combat dengue, which has killed 9 people in the city
this year [2009].

For 2010, there is no prospect of a new dengue epidemic in Ceara. The
peak usually occurs every 5 years and the last recorded one was in
2008, with 44 224 confirmed cases and 55 deaths. This year [2009], the
number is much lower: 4513 cases and 17 deaths. The rate may seem low
compared to 2008, but is still worrying.

"(The number of deaths) is considered high and surprised us, since we
had a relatively low number of cases. The trend is that, increasingly,
we have a proportion of severe cases because most people have had
dengue," explained Alex Mont'Alverne, head of the Municipal Health
Secretariat (SMS).

Therefore, Ceara is on the list of 12 priority states of the Ministry
of Health and today will be visited by Prime Minister Jose Socrates.

The heavy rainfall combined with the accumulation of trash in homes
and backyards, as well as the influx of migrant people this year
[2009] and other adverse factors, can lead to a new epidemic of dengue
in Alta Floresta. The indices of the disease are still at a lower
level compared to the same period last year [2008], but still the
concern of health authorities is that the lack of care by residents
can generate negative consequences.

In the case of notifications of dengue fever, there were about 185
between January and October [2009]. In the same period of 2008 it had
fluctuated between 315 - 320. For the Coordinator of Environmental
Monitoring, Claudiomiro Viera, the fall in the recorded [cases] cannot
mean [false] comfort. According to the representative, a large part of
the cases this year arose starting in the month of August, when the
rainy season began.

The environmental sector data show that the neighborhood Bom Jesus
leads in the statistics of [dengue] notifications. By the end of last
month [Oct 2009] the count was from 45-50. Currently in Boa Nova,
there are an estimated 35 [cases]. Both localities record low rates of
[mosquito] infestation. From this point of view the sector that ranks
1st in the number of infestations is sector H, where for nearly 100
homes there are 2 (1.79) with foci of mosquito [breeding sites]. Next
comes Vila Nova with 1.78 and with a household index of 1.02.

Recently, in the city, the government itself initiated a new campaign
whose focus is to educate and mobilize the population about the need
to interact in the fight against dengue. To accomplish this,
environmental agents have spoken to the media about the existing
situations in the neighborhoods.

With the arrival of warmer weather and the forecast of rain of more
than the historical average, November is more like a starting point
for large actions against dengue and its vector, the mosquito _Aedes
aegypti_. Both the state government and the Ministry of Health make
this month a strategic moment in anticipation of a possible epidemic
of the disease between late 2009 and early 2010.
The State Department of Health (SESA) scheduled a "D-Day" to fight
dengue on the 14th [Nov 2009]. All regional development activities are
to remind the public about disease precautions and cleaning of their
yards. According to the Secretariat, 945 foci of dengue [virus
