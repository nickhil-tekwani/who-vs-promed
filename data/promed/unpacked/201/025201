A 4-year-old horse in Bradford County has been confirmed as the state's 3rd case of Eastern equine encephalitis and the 1st in that county, according to the Bradford Union Department of Health.

The Missouri fox trotter breed, which had not been vaccinated against the disease, came down with symptoms on 23 Apr 2015, according to county health officials. The state Division of Agriculture confirmed it had the disease on Monday and it was euthanized. Now Bradford County Emergency Management officials recommend that the public begin protecting themselves from exposure to mosquito bites which can cause encephalitis. Officials strongly recommend that horse owners vaccinate their animals as well.

As for humans, avoid outdoor activity when mosquitoes are feeding and flying and wear clothing that covers skin when outdoors. Use of repellents containing Deet is highly recommended plus ridding areas of standing water where mosquitoes lay eggs.

[The rains in many areas are increasing the likelihood of having mosquitoes around.

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) is a mosquito-borne viral disease of all equine species such as horses, asses, and zebras. After infection, equines may suddenly die or show progressive central nervous system disorders.

Clinical signs in EEE-infected equines may include one or more of the following signs: fever; depression; anorexia (loss of appetite, not eating); weakness; central nervous system disorders (lack of coordination, chewing movements, head pressing, "sawhorse" stance, circling, paddling motion of the limbs, and convulsions); irritability and aggressiveness towards handlers; blindness; excitability; abnormal sensitivity to light and sound; in some cases, horses infected with EEE may show no clinical signs before dying.

The virus that causes EEE is transmitted primarily by mosquitoes that bite an infected animal [or bird] and then bite and feed on another animal or human. The speed with which the disease spreads depends on the density of mosquito populations.

There are fly and mosquito sprays for horses that are helpful in repelling the mosquitoes. However, the most effective prevention is vaccination. Vaccination usually comes in a combination vaccine for other viruses, such as West Nile virus (WNV) and western equine encephalitis (WEE). Vaccination is usually required to be repeated in 2-4 weeks for effective immunity. EEE immunity wanes rapidly, and animals should be revaccinated approximately every 4-6 months depending upon location.

It should be emphasized that humans may contract this disease but only from mosquitoes. Equine owners cannot get the disease from their equine companions.

There is a very effective vaccine against Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) for horses. It should be given annually, and in high-risk areas, the Eastern and Gulf Coast areas, it should be given every 4-6 months for maximum protection. It is always sad when animal dies needlessly. Vaccinate your animals. The vaccine should be given in at least twice a year, or preferably, 3 or more times.

Birds are the reservoir host, and the black-tailed mosquito _Culiseta melanura_ is the vector in swamps. Other species may be bridge vectors, carrying the virus out of swamp areas into adjoining localities, and transmitting the virus to humans and equine animals. Clinical cases in humans are very serious, with a case fatality rate of 33 per cent and significant neurological sequelae in survivors (see http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis). It is prudent to follow the recommendations above to avoid mosquito bites.

Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. EEE is a rare illness in humans, and only a few cases are reported in the United States each year. Most cases occur in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast states. Most persons infected with EEEV have no apparent illness. Severe cases of EEE (involving encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain) begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting. The illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures, or coma. EEE is one of the most severe mosquito-transmitted diseases in the United States, with approximately 33 percent mortality and significant brain damage in most survivors. There is no specific treatment for EEE; care is based on symptoms. You can reduce your risk of being infected with EEEV by using insect repellent, wearing protective clothing, and staying indoors while mosquitoes are most active. If you think you or a family member may have EEE, it is important to consult your healthcare provider for proper diagnosis. - Mod.TG
