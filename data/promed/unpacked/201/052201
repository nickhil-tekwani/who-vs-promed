A total of 4 new polio cases were detected in Pakistan Friday [27 Dec 2019]; 2 of these were from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and 2 from Sindh.

With the new cases, the tally for this year [2019] has risen to 115, said the National Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) for polio. If the vaccine-derived polio cases are also taken into account, the total comes to 127.

The 1st case was a 15-month-old boy from KP's Tank district. He had received no routine dose of the polio vaccine and 7 doses of supplemental immunisation, according to his parents.

The 2nd case was a 17-month-old girl from KP's Bannu district. Her parents said she received 3 routine doses of the polio vaccine and no supplementary dose.

In Sindh, the poliovirus was found in a 7-year-old girl from Sukkur and a 22-month [-old boy] from Tando Allah Yar, confirmed the EOC Sindh. The girl had received one routine dose and 7 supplementary doses. The affected boy has passed away due to severe prior illnesses, which had lasted 2 weeks before the polio diagnosis, said the officials.

"We have just started our battle afresh with the successful December [2019] nationwide campaign -- [the] 1st since January [2019], as the April [2019] attempt was affected by unfortunate Peshawar drama," the National EOC stated.

"Two follow-up national campaigns are planned in February [2020] and April [2020] that, along with efforts for improving routine immunisation coverage, can turn the tide."

They have urged parents to get their children vaccinated in light of the rampant spread of the virus this year [2019]. The December polio campaign was last week, and further campaigns are planned next year [2020] to strengthen coverage.

[The 4 newly reported cases are confirmed on the End Polio Pakistan website (https://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces). As mentioned in the above media report, if you add the 12 AFP cases associated with cVDPV2 infection, the total number of poliovirus-associated AFP for 2019 to date (27 Dec 2019) in Pakistan is now at 127 cases. The sobering information is the reminder that there hasn't been a successful national campaign since January 2019 -- clearly a contributing factor in the current polio epidemic.

On the global level, the addition of these 4 cases will raise the global total of WPV1-associated AFP cases to 141 cases.
