Nasarawa State Government confirmed on [Thu 9 Sep 2021], the death of 59 people following a cholera outbreak in the state. Director of Public Health in the State Ministry of Health, Dr. Ibrahim Adamu Alhassan, who disclosed this in an interview with journalists in Lafia, explained that since the outbreak of cholera in the state about 6 months ago, 892 cases have been recorded with 59 deaths.

According to Dr. Alhassan, the disease has been reported in 8 out of the 13 local government areas of Doma, Lafia, Wamba, Kokona, Obi, Nasarawa, Toto and Karuadding that most of the communities that the disease have been reported practiced open defecation and lacked potable drinking water.

Alhassan, however, said that the state government had taken measures to contend further spread of the disease with a multisectoral approach, including expansion of sensitization campaigns and identification of the affected communities to provide them with motorized boreholes among others.

Two people have died due to diarrhea and around 300 people are suffering from the infection in North 24 Parganas district's Kamarhati, with the West Bengal health department declaring a cholera outbreak in the area, a senior official said on [Thu 9 Sep 2021]. Medical camps have been set up in that locality for distribution of ORS packets, the official stated.

"At least 297 people from Kamarhati Municipality have reported ill at Sagar Dutta Medical College and Hospital due to the water-borne disease. As of now, 150 people are undergoing treatment at the hospital. Of the samples that were sent for detailed examination, 3 tested positive for _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Ogawa. Fortunately, the causative agent is sensitive to most drugs," he explained.

A team of senior doctors from the state health department, during the day, visited the Sagar Dutta Medical College and Hospital and places in Kamarhati and inspected the water supply system, further advising adequate chlorination to kill germs, the official underscored. "3 medical camps have been set up in Kamarhati, and over 16 000 ORS packets, along with plenty of halogen tablets, distributed to people in the affected areas," he added.

[Kamarhati is a city and a municipality of North 24 Parganas district in the Indian state of West Bengal. It is close to Kolkata and also a part of the area covered by Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA). West Bengal can be seen on a map of India at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal.

A recent post about this outbreak in West Bengal did not specifically state that cholera was the cause but this moderator wrote that it likely was, and it now has been confirmed to be _Vibrio cholerae_ serogroup O1, serotype Ogawa. As a review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _Vibrio cholerae_ are shared with many water vibrios and therefore are of no use in distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic) antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139 known serogroups. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are nonvirulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which is "non-O1"), a single serogroup, designated O1, has been responsible for epidemic cholera.

There are 3 distinct O1 serotypes -- Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima -- each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype (or biotype). The biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A, B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba contains antigens A and C; and Hikojima contains antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare. - Mod.LL
