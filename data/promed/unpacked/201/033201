Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Infection - WHO Update 34
--------------------------------------------------------
Situation (human) in Viet Nam: media reports of a new human case
----------------------------------------------------------------
WHO is aware of media reports of a new fatal case of avian influenza A
(H5N1) virus infection in a 12-year-old boy from a southern province in
Viet Nam [see also: ProMED-mail post entitled "Avian influenza, human -
East Asia (33) 20040320.0782]. According to the media, the boy was
hospitalized on 13 Mar 2004 and died 2 days later.
WHO has asked health authorities in Viet Nam for details about the case but
has not yet received confirmatory information.
If confirmed, this will be the 1st reported case in Viet Nam since 20 Feb
2004, when authorities announced infection in a 16-month-old girl
hospitalized on 16 Feb 2004.

[Until this case is confirmed by WHO, the total number of human cases of
avian influenza (H5N1) virus infection in East Asia should be given as 34,
of whom 23 have died: 12 cases and 8 deaths in Thailand, and 22 cases and
15 deaths in Viet Nam. - Mod.CP]
