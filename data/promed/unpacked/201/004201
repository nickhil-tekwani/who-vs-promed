An outbreak of _Salmonella_ infections has been linked to Cavi brand whole, fresh papayas. The CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ Uganda infections. As of 3 Jul 2019, a total of 71 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Uganda have been reported from 8 states.

State / Ill people
Connecticut / 14
Florida / 1
Massachusetts / 5
New Jersey / 18
New York / 27
Pennsylvania / 4
Rhode Island / 1
Texas / 1
-----------
Total / 71

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 14 Jan 2019 to 16 Jun 2019. Most illnesses have occurred since April 2019. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 90 years, with a median age of 60 years; 52% of ill people are female. Of 45 people with available information, 27 (60%) have been hospitalized. No deaths attributed to _Salmonella_ have been reported. Of 40 ill people with available information, 28 (70%) reported being of Hispanic ethnicity.

Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

Whole genome sequencing analysis of 43 isolates from ill people predicted antimicrobial resistance to streptomycin and sulfisoxazole. Testing of 3 clinical isolates using standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) is currently underway. This resistance will not affect the choice of antimicrobial used to treat most people.

Investigation of the outbreak
-------------------------
Epidemiologic and traceback evidence indicates that Cavi brand whole, fresh papayas imported from Mexico are a likely source of this outbreak.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Of 26 people who were interviewed, 20 (77%) reported eating papayas. This proportion was significantly higher than results from a survey of healthy Hispanic people in the months of January through June [2019], in which 13% reported eating papayas in the week before they were interviewed.

The FDA and regulatory officials in several states collected records from grocery stores where ill people reported buying papayas. These records showed that Cavi brand papayas were sold at multiple grocery stores where ill people bought papayas. Cavi brand papayas distributed by Agroson's LLC of Bronx, New York, would have been available for purchase by cases in the time prior to illness at these stores.

Consumers should not eat Cavi brand whole, fresh papayas imported from Mexico. This investigation is ongoing, and the CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

[Nine more cases in this outbreak have been reported, and the brand of papayas has been identified. A 2017 USA outbreak from imported papayas was originally associated with serotype Kiambu, but multiple serotypes were eventually linked to the outbreak. - Mod.LL
