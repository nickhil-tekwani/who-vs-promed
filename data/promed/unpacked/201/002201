The Democratic Republic of the Congo: Ebola haemorrhagic fever update
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Following the confirmed laboratory diagnosis of the presence of Ebola
haemorrhagic fever virus in samples taken from cases in the province
of Kasai Occidental of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, WHO is
currently upgrading its field operations to support the Ministry of
Health in managing and containing the outbreak.
A team from the WHO Country Office has been present in the affected
area since 3 Sep 2007 with further staff from the WHO Regional Office
for Africa joining the field operations on 7 Sep 2007 and this week
from WHO Headquarters. The WHO team is working closely with
representatives of the Ministry of Health and Medecins Sans
Frontieres to upgrade the existing facilities. Of high priority is
the establishment of a mobile field laboratory to be attached to the
existing isolation ward in order to expedite rapid diagnosis of
patients and to differentiate between the different pathogens, such
as _Shigella dysenteriae_ type 1, that have also been associated with
this outbreak. Ongoing surveillance and case finding is also being
enhanced and social mobilization activities are under-way to provide
the local population with all relevant information in order to
contain the outbreak.
WHO is also establishing a logistics platform in the vicinity to
support the field operations and to facilitate access to the affected area.
