Japan: Gastroenteritis reaches menacing level
-----------------------------------------------
Gastroenteritis, an illness which leaves people vomiting and with
diarrhea, has reached a record high level, according to the
[Japanese] National Institute of Infectious Diseases. Japan's more
than 3000 pediatric clinics reported that from 20 to 26 Nov 2006,
there was an average of 19.8 outbreaks of the norovirus-caused
disease, the highest figure since records began in 1981. Experts warn
that gastroenteritis normally peaks from late-December and fear the
worst of the outbreak may be yet to come. Ministry of Health, Labor
and Welfare officials are urging people to wash their hands
thoroughly. Institute officials said that it became obvious in early
October 2006 that there were more gastroenteritis cases evident this
year than normal. Outbreaks spread most rapidly in western Japan to
begin with, later moving eastward through Chubu to the Kanto regions.
Since late October 2006, gastroenteritis cases have been double those
of regular years.
The norovirus that causes gastroenteritis is transmitted through raw
foods or foods that have not been sufficiently heated before eating.
Secondary transmission can also occur through coming into contact
with the vomit or waste products of infected people. As of 26 Nov
2006, the most recent tests showed that the most affected prefectures
have been Toyama, Gunma, Mie, Fukui and Miyazaki.
Gastroenteritis symptoms normally disappear after a couple of days,
but it has lead to fatalities among the elderly in Osaka and Nara prefectures.

[It has become apparent that noroviruses are genetically diverse
viruses. The reason for the severity of illness in Japan may be a
consequence of circulation of a particularly virulent strain. The
extent and progressive spread of the outbreak is not consistent with
involvement of a unique food-borne source of infection. - Mod.CP]
