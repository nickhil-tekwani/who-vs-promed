Your report (ProMED-mail 4 July 1999) is an early detection of influenza
activity outside the normal winter season but Alaska is not the only area
of the Northern Hemisphere that has been associated with influenza
outbreaks during the summer months. At the beginning of June 1999, the
PHLS in London was alerted to an outbreak of respiratory infection on board
a British cruise liner sailing in the Mediterranean where 55 of 490 crew
and 60 of 590 passengers developed symptoms of fever, lethargy, sore throat
and myalgia between 22 May and 4 June. A PHLS medical virologist joined
the ship in Tangiers on 3 June and took nose and throat swabs from 29
recently sick
people. Within 48 hours of return to the UK on 4 June, the PHLS detected
influenza A by PCR in 21/29 samples and in 22 of these samples, influenza A
Sydney 5/97 (H3N2) - like isolates were also obtained. The rapid diagnosis
facilitated the early implementation of control measures on the ship and a
vaccination programme amongst the crew, none of whom had previously been
vaccinated against influenza.
