SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, Chile
--------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 22 Oct 2020 from Dr. Oscar Eduardo Videla Perez, Head of the Livestock Protection Division, Agricultural and Livestock Service, Ministry of Agriculture, Santiago, Chile

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification (final report)
Date of start of the event: 1 May 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 1 Oct 2020
Report date: 22 Oct 2020
Date submitted to OIE: 22 Oct 2020
Reason for notification: Emerging disease
Morbidity: 5 (scale 0 to 5)
Mortality: 0 (scale 0 to 5)
Zoonotic impact: Zoonotic potential currently unknown
Causal agent: SARS-CoV-2

New outbreaks (1)
Total outbreaks: 1
Total affected animals:
Outbreak location: Santiago, Santiago [Metropolitan Region]
Date of start of the outbreak: 1 May 2020
Outbreak status: Resolved 8 Jun 2020
Epidemiological unit: Not applicable
Animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cats / 3 / 3 / 0 / 0 / 0

Affected population: Viral RNA was detected by RT-PCR in cat 1 (with a closer link with one of the owners) in nasal secretions and faeces. Four and 5 days after this finding, viral RNA was detected in the other two cats (2 and 3), also in nasal secretions and faeces. During monitoring and successive sampling carried out on the animals, persistence of viral excretion was observed for 4 days (cat 1), 7 days (cat 2), and 16 days (cat 3). After that, the virus became undetectable in samples from these animals.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cats / 100 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Transmission from human to animal suspected.
Epidemiological comments: Within a research study carried out by a state university on domestic animals in COVID-19-positive homes, 3 domestic cats were sampled 5 days after the occurrence of symptoms in their owners (2 people) who were COVID-19-positive. After the molecular results, the isolates from the owners and the animals were sequenced, and a genetic cluster between them was established.

Control measures
Measures applied: Quarantine; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
FAVET (private laboratory) / Cats / Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 8 Jun 2020 / Positive
FAVET (private laboratory) / Cats / Virus sequencing / 1 Oct 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[The following has been extracted from the OIE Technical factsheet "Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in animals" (last updated September 2020), available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/MM/EN_2_Factsheet_SARS-CoV-2_v8_final.pdf:

Although current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 emerged from an animal source, likely a bat, that source has yet to be identified. The pandemic is driven by person-to-person transmission, which happens through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, and talking that can remain in the air for some time as aerosols. Genetic sequence data reveal that SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in _Rhinolophus_ bat (horseshoe bat) populations. To date, there is not enough scientific evidence to identify the source of SARS-CoV-2 or to explain the original route of transmission to humans (which may involve an intermediate host).

Several animal species have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with infection being introduced to a population as a result of close contact with humans or animals infected with SARS-CoV-2 or in experimental infection studies performed in laboratory settings.

Biosecurity and hygiene measures are key to preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2. People who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 should restrict contact with mammalian animals, including pets, just like they would with people during their illness.

Animals suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 should remain separated from other animals and humans while infected. Due to their susceptibility, some animal species are being used as models to test vaccines for use in humans. No SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are licensed for use in animals.
