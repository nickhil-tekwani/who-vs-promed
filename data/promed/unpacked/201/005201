The World Health Organization (WHO) is expected to send an expert to
South Africa this week, amid the finding of 10 more cases of
extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB) in the Eastern Cape,
Acting Health Minister, Jeff Radebe, said Sat 24 Mar 2007. This
brings to 54 the number of XDR TB cases reported in the province
since November 2006.
Mr Radebe was in the province to mark International TB Day. He said
the WHO expert would arrive in the country this week and would offer
technical assistance in the management of XDR TB. "The assistance
will include advice on training and management of XDR TB cases,
infection control, improvement of surveillance systems, and
laboratory services," minister Radebe said.
Sizwe Kupelo, spokesperson for the provincial health department, said
the department had established a TB crisis plan that would focus on
the Nelson Mandela, Amathole, and OR Tambo District Municipalities.
He said the 3 district municipalities had been targeted because of
the high number of ordinary TB cases reported. "The department is now
looking at a 50 percent TB cure rate in the targeted areas," said Kupelo.
Furthermore, he said, the department would embark on a massive
awareness and advocacy campaign on XDR TB and multidrug-resistant TB
(MDR TB) in the province. "The department has also hired 1422
unemployed youths who will monitor patients to ensure they take their
medication regularly. This will help ensure that the patients [do]
not develop the XDR TB.
Isolation wards for the 10 XDR TB patients have been set up in the
Mthatha and East London Hospitals.
