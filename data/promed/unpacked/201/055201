Tsunami survivors warned of deadly fungus infection
-----------------------------------------------
At least 3 Australian survivors of the Indian Ocean tsunami have been
infected with a deadly fungus, and the condition may be commonplace
among victims still in the disaster zone, an infectious diseases
specialist said on Fri 28 Jan 2005.
Pamela Kocecny, from Sydney's St. George Hospital, said the fungal
disease, called mucormycosis, is fatal in 80 percent of cases if left
untreated. Found in soil and rotting plants, it aggressively infects
wounds and kills flesh with necrotizing lesions. Kocecny said she
knew of 3 Australian tsunami survivors diagnosed with mucormycosis,
which would have gone undetected had they remained in the disaster
zone. She said it was impossible to estimate how many survivors in
tsunami-affected areas were infected, because it was hard to detect
even in hospitals with advanced laboratories.
"We don't know how prevalent it is, because large numbers of people
in these areas don't have access to the diagnostic facilities needed
to find it," she told Agence France-Presse. "You can find the fungi
in any soil or decaying matter, it's usually not a major problem for
fit, healthy people, but it can take off in people with deep wounds
and run down immune systems."
Kocecny and her colleagues are treating a 56-year-old Australian man
infected with mucormycosis in a case documented this week [final week
of January 2005] in The Lancet medical journal. She said the man had
been staying in a beach hut at the Sri Lankan town of Tangalle when
the tsunami struck. The force of the water forced him through the
wall of the hut, causing deep flesh wounds that became infected with
the fungus. Kocecny said the man was being treated in an isolation
unit, although mucormycosis is not communicable.
Treatment involves surgically removing all dead and infected tissue
and administering a course of antifungal therapy. She said doctors
treating tsunami survivors should be on the lookout for mucormycosis,
which was most aggressive in patients whose immune systems had been
weakened by other infections.
"A lot of people in tsunami areas are going to be in that position,
and many will also not be up to scratch nutritionally, so they'll be
vulnerable," Kocecny said. "It's going to have an impact on fatality
and morbidity rates."

[This case is mentioned in the 10 Jan 2005 posting (20050110.0079).
Mucormycosis, sometimes referred to as zygomycosis, is the name given
to infections caused by fungi of the order Mucorales including
organisms of species _Rhizopus_, _Rhizomucor_, _Mucor_, and
_Cunninghamella_. They are quite ubiquitous in the environment,
including being isolated from nonsterile adhesive tape and tongue
depressors and being linked to human infection (1, 2).
This widespread distribution is balanced by the low virulence of the
fungi in humans, generally limited to individuals with severe
immunoincompetence or diabetes. Additionally, however, as described
in the above posting, contamination of devitalized tissue during
trauma can result in mucormycosis even without other risk factors (3).
