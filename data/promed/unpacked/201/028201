VLADIVOSTOK, Russia : A toxic slick that threatened the water supply of
several large Chinese cities along the Songhua river has reached Russian
territory, Russia's emergencies minister said. "The water polluted with
benzene today reached the Russian border and has flowed into the Amur
river," which forms the border between the 2 countries, the minister,
Sergei Shoigu, said in the city of Khabarovsk, near the Chinese border.
Initial tests by Russian experts have showed, however, that the slick,
which contains benzene and nitrobenzene, is not as highly concentrated as
had been feared and is continuing to dilute, officials from the emergency
situations ministry said.
Shoigu said the authorities were prepared to ensure safe drinking supplies,
regardless. "Water reserves and carbon (filters) have been set up. Artesian
wells have been reopened," he was quoted as saying in a statement released
by the authorities.
Widespread contamination prevention efforts have been under way in China
and Russia since an explosion on November 13 at a PetroChina chemical
factory in the north east Chinese province of Jilin. The accident led to
the spillage of 100 tonnes of carcinogens into the Songhua River, one of
China's longest waterways and a source of water for millions of people.
Chinese media also reported that the slick had significantly diluted ahead
of entering Russia. -- AFP/de Map and additional information on the Songua
