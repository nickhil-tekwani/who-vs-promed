Abstract
--------
To assess the role of in-flight transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we investigated a cluster of cases among passengers on a 10-hour commercial flight. Affected persons were passengers, crew, and their close contacts. We traced 217 passengers and crew to their final destinations and interviewed, tested, and quarantined them. Among the 16 persons in whom SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected, 12 (75%) were passengers seated in business class along with the only symptomatic person (attack rate 62%). Seating proximity was strongly associated with increased infection risk (risk ratio 7.3, 95% CI 1.2-46.2). We found no strong evidence supporting alternative transmission scenarios. In-flight transmission that probably originated from one symptomatic passenger caused a large cluster of cases during a long flight. Guidelines for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection among air passengers should consider individual passengers' risk for infection, the number of passengers traveling, and flight duration.

Discussion
---------
In January 2020, no secondary cases were detected after a 15-hour flight to Canada with a symptomatic person with COVID-19 on board (29), although contact tracing and monitoring were limited (30). Similar results with similar limitations have been reported from flights arriving in France (31,32) and Thailand (33) in January and February. All of these studies limited contact tracing to passengers within 2 rows of the index cases, which could explain why secondary flight-related transmission was not detected by those studies.

The latest guidance from the international air travel industry classifies the in-flight transmission risk as very low (34) and recommends only the use of face masks without additional measures to increase physical distance on board, such as blocking the middle seats (7,35). Our findings challenge these recommendations. Transmission on flight VN54 was clustered in business class, where seats are already more widely spaced than in economy class, and infection spread much [farther] than the existing 2-row (36) or 2-meters [6 ft] (37) rule recommended for COVID-19 prevention on airplanes and other public transport would have captured. Similar conclusions were reached for SARS-CoV superspreader events on a flight in 2003, in which a high risk for infection was observed for passengers seated farther than 3 rows from the index case (4). This finding also concurs with transmission patterns observed for influenza virus (38) and is generally in line with the mounting evidence that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a major yet underrecognized transmission route (39,40).

Our findings call for tightened screening and infection prevention measures by public health authorities, regulators, and the airline industry, especially in countries where substantial transmission is ongoing (37). Making mask wearing obligatory and making hand hygiene and cough etiquette standard practice while on board and at airports seems an obvious and relatively simple measure (27). Blocking middle seats, currently recommended by the airline industry (7,35), may in theory prevent some in-flight transmission events but seems to be insufficient to prevent superspreading events. Also, systematic testing, quarantine policies, or both, for inbound passengers at arrival might be justified for countries with low levels of community transmission, high risk for case importation, and limited contact tracing capacity (5). In Viet Nam, for example, as a result of this investigation, national policy was changed toward mandatory testing at arrival irrespective of departure location and 14-day quarantine irrespective of test result or clinical signs/symptoms (41). This policy change eliminated the need for resource-intensive contact tracing of flight passengers altogether and enabled detection of another 106 cases among [more than] 5000 passengers on 44 flights until all international flights were halted on 28 Mar 2020. However, given the logistic and economic implications of such policies, the development of a quick and reliable point-of-care test that covers the entire infectious period remains paramount.

We conclude that the risk for on-board transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during long flights is real and has the potential to cause COVID-19 clusters of substantial size, even in business class-like settings with spacious seating arrangements well beyond the established distance used to define close contact on airplanes. As long as COVID-19 presents a global pandemic threat in the absence of a good point-of-care test, better on-board infection prevention measures and arrival screening procedures are needed to make flying safe.

---
The point mentioned of documented transmission from a greater than 2-meter distance (about 6 ft, 7 in) is disconcerting. Since this event happened, airplanes have been increasing air exchange, which should reduce the likelihood of transmission from lingering droplets and potentially aerosolized particles, but the need for throwing a wider net is an important recommendation.

Viet Nam is not the only country in Asia doing testing of all international arrivals -- China and South Korea have been doing this regularly as well. One wonders if the use of the rapid antigen tests under development in this setting may be helpful in screening for infectious individuals but might miss low-level infections that PCR testing would pick up. - Mod.MPP]

On Wednesday [16 Sep 2020], a group of scientists gathered -- virtually, of course -- to share their research on a video call. At this point in the COVID-19 pandemic, that was utterly normal. What was not at all normal: The group was launching an international network to detect pathogens that can jump from wildlife to the human population.

The network, known as CREID (for Centers for Research in Emerging Infectious Diseases), was announced 3 weeks ago by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases within the National Institutes of Health. The NIH is investing USD 17 million this year [2020] and USD 82 million across 5 years to create 11 research nodes, mostly at US universities, that will spin up research partnerships in 28 other countries -- including China, where the current pandemic began.

If all goes well, this could establish a worldwide surveillance structure that detects the next pandemic pathogen before it leaps into humans from the wild world. That would be a good thing. As far back as the 1st international epidemic of a novel coronavirus, SARS, in 2003, every spillover of a pathogen from wildlife to humans -- including the H1N1 avian flu epidemic in 2009, MERS in 2012, Ebola in West Africa in 2014, and Zika in South America in 2016 -- has come as a surprise. This network could break that pattern.

"We've all learned the hard way that every time there is an emergence, that triggers some sort of disorganized scramble," says Nikos Vasilakis, a professor of pathology at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston, who will lead one of the new centers. "This gives us the possibility of a coordinated response, a chance to create a strategically and geographically dispersed network of sites that would be able to forewarn of any disease emergence, whatever that emergence is."

There are 11 centers -- 10 research nodes and an operational and data hub at Duke University, up from an originally envisioned 3 -- in order to cover the breadth of the science needed to detect, identify, understand, and potentially control pathogens in the process of leaping to humans. That requires working in multiple disciplines to understand how a pathogen lives in a host animal, what features allow it to cause infection in people, how human immune systems respond, and what tests and treatments might be developed to detect and block deadly organisms.

It also requires putting research capacity in multiple locations, from the fringes of human settlement where hunters and farmers may be exposed to novel pathogens, to villages where human-to-human transmission begins, and to urban areas where adapted pathogens can find enough hosts to cause explosive outbreaks. Working in that manner requires local collaborators. Having those collaborators also grounds the work in other countries, keeping the research from being extractive and guaranteeing that it will benefit economically developing nations where viruses spill over as much as it will industrialized ones where viruses might spread.

Vasilakis' research center has been dubbed Create-Neo, which is short for Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics. (Many of the new centers have amazingly elaborate acronyms.) It will focus on viruses in Central and South America that are carried by mosquitoes and ticks; they include major killers such as yellow fever and Zika. The center grew out of past work that Vasilakis and his colleagues, including his wife Shannan Rossi, an associate professor at UTMB, were doing in Brazil, detecting exposures of monkeys and humans to viruses carried by forest mosquitoes, and detecting how the mosquito populations moved and carried viruses with them.

To do their new work within CREID, they recruited a slate of partners: 3 institutes in Panama and Brazil, and in the USA, MIT and the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in New York State. The co-principal investigator, Katherine Hanley, is a professor of virus evolutionary ecology at New Mexico State University.

That geographic reach is typical of the new project, in which 10 US grant recipients and one in Paris are forming their own mini-networks internationally. For instance, Washington State University's Center for Research in Emerging Infectious Diseases -- East and Central Africa (CREID-ECA) is collaborating with Emory University in Atlanta and with institutes in Germany, Belgium, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. University of Washington's United World Antiviral Research Network (the acronym is, yes, UWARN) is working with universities in Brazil, Senegal, South Africa, Pakistan, and Taipei.

Just one of the new centers will be doing work in China. The Center for Research in Emerging Infectious Disease -- Epidemiology, Surveillance, Pathogenesis (CREID-ESP) at Washington University in St. Louis plans to partner with the University of Hong Kong and the China CDC, as well as institutes in California, Ethiopia, and Nepal. Most of their work will be on coronaviruses, with an additional focus on whatever viruses underlie unexplained respiratory diseases, according to principal investigator David Wang, a professor of pathology and immunology.

It's a familiar landscape for him: He was one of the identifiers of the original SARS virus in 2003. Working in viral characterization since then and watching the emergence of MERS and the virus behind COVID-19 gives him an acute sense of where surveillance and pandemic prediction falls short -- something the new network might remedy. "We learned almost nothing from SARS," he says. "It showed us that you need strong public health infrastructure and you have to be prepared for the possibility of rapid dissemination. But we've never invested sufficiently in public health because public health is prevention -- and when it works really well, nothing happens."

Regardless of the maneuvering, EcoHealth now heads a project within CREID that it calls the Emerging Infectious Diseases: South East Asia Research Collaboration Hub (boasting the excellent acronym EID-SEARCH). The name may hint at how NIAID, the source of the new grants and headed by Tony Fauci, routed around the controversy. The EcoHealth Alliance won't be working in China; its projects are in Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. "...What we felt was important was to look at Southeast Asia, because it's the regional hub for zoonotic pathogens: Nipah virus, avian flu repeatedly, coronaviruses, even evidence of Ebola-like viruses," [said Peter Daszak, EcoHealth executive director].

The point isn't only to do the surveillance that identifies viruses in animals as they come close to the human realm. It is also to develop tests that allow them to identify exposed humans and then tease out the behaviors that allowed those people to be exposed. "We want to ask communities, 'Do you eat wildlife? Do you catch it? If you don't catch it, who sells it? How much do you pay for it?'" Daszak says. "We want to identify the incentives for people to put themselves at risk and, therefore, figure out what we can do to bring in behavior change to reduce that risk." The goal, he says, is to locate the new research at the point where prevention and response meet: anticipating where pathogens spill over into humans in time to stop them, or uncovering the 1st cases in humans before they can spread. "Our current strategy for combating pandemics is what it was a century ago: Expect a pandemic to emerge and hope we can contain it," he says. "We can't afford to do that again. This is a far-sighted way of doing it differently."

[Observations are that 75% of new diseases in humans are zoonotic and 70% of new diseases in animals come from wildlife. Hence, a key initiative to identify the potential pathogens that exist in wildlife, and be able to either prevent or identify early in the species jump stage when a new human pathogen arises. The above initiative is a critical endeavor in pandemic preparedness -- the identification of potential organisms that may undergo a species jump from wildlife to domestic animals to humans or directly from wildlife to humans. Bats have increasingly been identified as hosts and reservoirs of viral pathogens with human disease potential. A welcome initiative and timely given the ongoing pandemic of a virus identified in bats a number of years before the initial outbreak in Wuhan.

[The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India now in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (92 769), followed by the USA (51 345) and Brazil (39 991) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.5%) and 52.4% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 5991 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (17-18 Sep 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Spain (33 683), France (13 215), Peru (12 012), Argentina (11 945), Colombia (6526), and Russia (5905), and 33 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. Five of the 10 top countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the Americas region; 8 of the top 20 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the European region. Also, 13 of the 33 countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours are in the European region, and 10 of these 33 countries are in the Americas region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 9.5%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 9.8%.

Impression: Cases are increasing globally, with Europe showing major increasing transmission in many countries and the Americas region as well. - Mod.MPP]
