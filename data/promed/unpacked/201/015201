_Salmonella_ fall linked to egg campaign
----------------------------------------
The Government's advisers announced yesterday, the number of people
suffering from food poisoning has fallen dramatically since British farmers
started vaccinating their hens against salmonellae. The Advisory Committee
for the Safety of Food reported cases of salmonellosis in humans had more
than halved since the British Egg Industry Council (BEIC) launched a
campaign to eradicate salmonellae from eggs in 1997.
A total of 14 845 people suffered from the infection last year compared
with 32 596 in 1997, according to Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS)
figures. The 1997 figure was more than 5000 higher than in 1988, the year
when the then junior health minister Edwina Currie provoked a major row by
claiming that most egg production was affected. Three out of 4 eggs
produced in the United Kingdom now conform to Lion Quality scheme standards
set by the BEIC.
Andrew Parker, chairman of the egg council, said: "We have beaten
_Salmonella_ and increased consumer confidence. Egg sales are rising."
Prof. Douglas Georgala, chairman of the Advisory Committee for the Safety
of Food, said: "We believe we are seeing a real success story here." But
the Food Standards Agency (FSA) warned eating raw eggs could still be risky.

[It would appear, after more than 10 years, the incidence of _Salmonella_
on, or in the eggs may have dropped. This article does not indicate if
these results (fewer people falling ill to egg-borne salmonellosis) is
through vaccination of the hens, or consumer education of proper handling
of the eggs, and reduced consumption of raw/undercooked eggs. Furthermore,
there is no indication of serology on the hens or tests on the eggs to
document reduction of salmonellae. The reduction of human cases is
admirable, and we celebrate the success story. - Mod.TG
