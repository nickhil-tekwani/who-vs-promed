Concerning the above post, published on 2 Jan 2018, no evidence for H8 or H5N2 in poultry in Egypt is available to date. This is a mistake or a misunderstanding. Chickens in this farm were infected with H9, NDV and IBV and no highly pathogenic H5Nx was detected.

[Dr Abdelwhab is gratefully acknowledged for the above clarifying data, addressing ProMED-mail's request for information.

In Egypt, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) of subtype H5N1 and co-circulating low pathogenic AIV H9N2 have established endemic status (1). Various chicken flocks are suffering from respiratory disease caused, at least in part, by infection with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV).

Indeed, this phenomenon has been recently addressed (2) by FLI researchers, who studied IBV in Egypt's poultry farms. Mixed infections in their study were detected in 19 out of 28 IBV positive samples. This indicated an intricate situation in Egyptian poultry populations with unknown putative synergistic effects on pathogenicity and spread of these pathogens. They argued that effective control measures including vaccination may be severely compromised by this situation. The abstract of the paper follows:

"In Egypt, currently 2 geographically restricted genotypes of the infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) are circulating with detrimental effects for poultry industry. A sensitive real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the IBV nucleocapsid gene (N) was developed to screen clinical samples for presence of IBV. Conventional RT-PCRs amplifying hypervariable regions (HVRs 1-2 and 3) of the IBV S1 gene were developed and amplificates used for nucleotide sequence-based typing of IBV field strains in Egyptian chickens directly from clinical samples".
