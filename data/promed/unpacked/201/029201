1st report of _Columnea latent viroid_ on tomatoes in the United Kingdom
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has
reported 2 outbreaks of _Columnea latent viroid_ (CLVd;
Pospiviroidea) in tomato production nurseries in England (DEFRA,
2007). To prevent further spread of the viroid, restrictions have
been placed on the distribution and sale of the fruit and hygiene
measures have been implemented at the affected nurseries.
Investigations are underway to establish the origin and extent of the
infection and whether there are links to other sites. CLVd is
considered absent from the United Kingdom and could pose a
significant risk to tomato crops.
Although the severity of viroid symptoms in tomato may vary, they can
be serious, with infected plants displaying symptoms similar to
_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd). Chlorosis, bronzing, leaf
distortion, and growth reductions are possible. Potatoes are
considered a natural host for CLVd however, DEFRA reports infections
resulting from exposure to infected material are highly unlikely
under natural growing conditions.
The most effective means of controlling viroid diseases such as CLVd
is exclusion and eradication of infected materials. Viroids are
easily transmitted by mechanical means and once introduced onto a
production site or into a facility they can easily be spread via
contaminated cutting tools, on machinery, by handling, or through
direct plant-to-plant contact. While the source for these viroids in
crops such as tomato is not always clearly understood, many viroids,
including the closely related PSTVd, are seed transmitted, suggesting
that seed transmission could have played a direct or indirect role in
these recent CLVd outbreaks in the UK. In addition, it has been shown
that ornamental hosts such as, _Columnea erythrophae_, _Brunfelsia
undulata_ [Jamaican raintree], and _Nematanthus wettsteinii_
[goldfish plant] can be infected by CLVd asymptomatically and serve
as reservoirs for the viroid.

1st UK finding of _Tomato chlorotic dwarf viroid_ -- implications for
importers and growers of solanaceous plants
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Following the identification in 2006 of _Potato spindle tuber viroid_
(PSTVd) in the UK and several other EU countries, in the ornamental
species _Brugmansia_ and _Solanum jasminoides_, a survey for this
harmful viroid was initiated. A 2nd closely related viroid, _Tomato
chlorotic dwarf viroid_ (TCDVd) has now been identified for the 1st
time in the UK by laboratory testing of imported petunias. As a
result of these findings, the UK PSTVd survey will be extended to
include petunia.
Like PSTVd, TCDVd causes few symptoms in ornamental hosts. Some
puckering and distortion of the leaves and yellowing of the veins has
been observed in infected plants, but these symptoms would seem to be
temporary. However TCDVd can infect tomato crops, where it causes
serious problems, with symptoms similar to those caused by PSTVd,
such as stunting and yield loss. There is a strong risk that TCDVd
may also infect other important solanaceous crops such as peppers.
The major concern is that these infected ornamentals could act as a
means for the dispersal of viroids, as its movement between
ornamentals and the major hosts, by either mechanical or insect
assisted transmission, cannot be ruled out. There is also a
theoretical risk to potatoes from exposure to infected material, but
this is extremely unlikely under normal (that is, in the field)
growing conditions.
Given the recent findings, growers of all solanaceous ornamentals
should consider carefully the sourcing of all their propagation
material, rooted cuttings, young and mature plants. Growers are
strongly advised to seek assurances from their suppliers about the
status of any material ordered and to have material already received
tested for viroids before further propagation. Seeds of ornamentals
should also be considered a potential source until proven otherwise.
However, propagation of cuttings from infected plants is considered
the most likely route of infection.
Tomato and pepper growers are advised to avoid bringing solanaceous
ornamental plants onto their nurseries. A helpful fact sheet on
_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ is available from the Horticultural
Development Council (HDC). Given their close relationship, the advice
given for PSTVd will also apply for TCDVd.
As part of an official survey, samples will be collected by Defra's
Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate (PHSI) and sent for laboratory
testing. PSTVd is an EU Annex IAI listed pathogen and TCDVd is absent
from the EU and is considered to pose a significant risk to tomato
crops; this means that any material found to be infected during the
survey will be destroyed.

[Following detection of PSTVd and the adoption of EC emergency
measures in the UK, in 2007 Member States of the European Union were
required to carry out a survey of host plants for the presence of
PSTVd. This survey has led to these detections of CLVd and TCDVd,
which are both closely related to PSTVd.
CLVd is classified in the genus _Pospiviroid_ for which the type
member is PSTVd.
TCDVd was detected with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test
specific for pospiviroids, but is yet officially unclassified to a
genus. The viroid has previously been intercepted in the Netherlands
in quarantined petunia material from the United States and has also
been reported there in tomatoes.
