Boy treated for tick bite -- CCHF suspected
-------------------------------------------
A 10-year-old boy is being treated for a high fever at a hospital in
Alexandroupolis, northeastern Greece, after being bitten by a tick
just days after a woman in nearby Komotini died from a similar [tick] bite.

The 49-year-old woman died after being bitten by a tick while working
on a farm. Tests showed that the [tick] had infected her with
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF).

It was not clear if an infected tick had also bitten the boy. His
mother said she took the child to a dermatologist who removed the
tick but the boy then began to feel ill. Doctors at the University
Hospital of Alexandroupolis said on Saturday [5 Jul 2008] that the
boy was running a high temperature but his overall condition gave no
cause for alarm.

Authorities in northeastern Greece have agreed to spray livestock on
local farms with insecticide to kill any ticks carrying the fever.
Doctors have advised anyone bitten by ticks not to try and remove the
[tick] but to go to a hospital immediately.
