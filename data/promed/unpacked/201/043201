The mosquito-borne chikungunya virus appears to have become endemic in Singapore, after it had seemingly been eradicated.

The dengue-like disease took hold in April [2013] and there have been 924 cases this year [2013] -- of which 881 were locally transmitted. Last week [week of 25 Nov 2013], there were 36 new cases.

The National Environment Agency (NEA) said the bulk of the infections have been in the Sungei Kadut and Bukit Timah/Holland areas, although 4 of last week's cases were in the Defu Lane and Defu Avenue areas.

An NEA spokesman said: "These areas are in close proximity to lush vegetation where there is an abundance of natural habitats for the _Aedes albopictus_ (mosquito) - the primary vector for chikungunya [virus] here."

[The incidence of chikungunya virus infections has increased significantly when 500 cases were reported on 11 Aug 2013 to the 881 locally acquired cases cited above. It is interesting to note that _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes are the main mosquito vector of chikungunya virus in Singapore, rather than _Ae. aegypti_ the vector in the Philippines mentioned in the report below.
Control of _Ae. albopictus_ will be a challenge because of the abundance of breeding sites.

The number of cases of the mosquito-borne viral disease, chikungunya, has eclipsed 1600 cases during the 1st 11 months of 2013, according to a Philippine News Agency report Tuesday [3 Dec 2013].

The number of cases, 1609, is nearly triple the total of 561 cases recorded last year [2012].

Assistant Health Secretary, Dr Eric Tayag noted that the regions hardest hit by the virus include Southern Luzon (334 [cases]), Metro Manila (275), and Western Visayas (236).

In addition, Tayag said women and those 20 years of age and up were more likely to get infected.

According to a World Health Organization (WHO) Fact Sheet, chikungunya is a viral disease that is spread by mosquitoes. It causes fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue, and rash.

The disease shares some clinical signs with dengue, and can be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue is common.

There is no cure for the disease. Treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms.

The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya [virus infections].

The disease occurs in Africa, Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. In recent decades mosquito vectors of chikungunya [virus] have spread to Europe and the Americas. In 2007, disease transmission was reported for the 1st time in Europe, in a localized outbreak in north-eastern Italy.

The CDC notes there is currently no vaccine or medicine to prevent chikungunya [virus infections]. People can protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites.

[Chikungunya virus infections have been occurring in a variety of geographic locations on the Philippines this year (2013; see the ProMED-mail archives cited below). If the virus is endemic there, as seems likely, additional cases can be expected. There is no indication in this report if public health education is being implemented to enlist public participation to reduce _Ae. aegypti_ breeding sites and reduce the risk of mosquito bites.
