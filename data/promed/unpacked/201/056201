I agree that epidemiologists need to hold the press' feet to the fire in
disease reporting, but maybe holding our own to the fire would be a good
start.
Perhaps, Vicky Cardenas meant to say, "If you do the math QUICKLY, you will
see that the rates seen during the pre-approval phase are 5 times greater
(5/10 000) than the rates observed in the population (1/10 000)." [Note:
The ACIP July 16 recommendation reported a background rate from NY state
for 1991-97 of 5.1/10 000 infant-years.
Because, if you do the math, you will QUICKLY see that we don't have rates
for the pre-approval process, only a proportion of those who got
intussusception during varying follow-up intervals in the clinical trials.
We would certainly expect cases/risk to increase if follow up lasted a year
versus one week.
The Wall Street Journal (10/18/99, P. B1; Harris, Gardiner) reported the
removal of RotaShield (rotavirus vaccine) from the market over the weekend.
It mentions "the problems [presumably intussusception in vaccinees, which
led to the deaths of two infants, surgery in 53, and medical care for
another 47 infants." A minimum of 500 000 infants were vaccinated (1.5
million doses), which means a maximum risk of only 102/500 000 = 2/10 000
vaccinees!
So why did the vaccine get withdrawn? I assume that when rates are
calculated for the first week or two after vaccination, the risk during
that interval will be many times higher. We shall soon see as the data
will be discussed at ACIP on Friday.
Doesn't every epidemiology class teach that rates have time in them and
that they differ from proportions/percentages? The long-term risk of death
for any exposure is 100% (the average body lasts a lifetime). Time is
important!
I would like to add that the past few months show the usefulness in
post-licensure surveillance of new vaccines. Prelicensure data for the
actual version of the vaccine licensed showed that only 2/8,8240 vaccinees
suffered intussusception, hardly different from placebo recipients (p=0.92).
In the meantime, rotavirus will continue to fill up the hospital beds
(around the world) and graves (in "less-developed" countries).

Of course Mr. Tucker is correct when he states that rates require a time
element in order to be calculated. Moderator John Woodall is the one who
picked up the misuse of the word in the _original_ posting when he said
"It's the word "rate" that was incorrect."
The original report suggests that bowel obstruction was more rare during
the testing phase than it was once the vaccine was released into the
population. With the limited information we are given _and_ assuming equal
follow up times, this is not the case.
I was not in any way suggesting that the vaccine should not have been
withdrawn. My point is that the reason that the press gave for the
withdrawal of the vaccine is misleading and can lead to a distrust of the
FDA's strict vaccine licensure procedures.
Despite these strict procedures, all new vaccines should be subject to
post-licensure surveillance given the lack of heterogeneity in the testing
population as well as the lack of time to do a thorough follow-up.
