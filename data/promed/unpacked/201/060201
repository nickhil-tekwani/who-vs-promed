News
Ebola response teams attacked by the community in the Bandibwame health area:
- Teams of the response to the #Ebola virus disease were attacked this Mon 13 Jan 2020 in the Bandibwame health area in Lolwa in the province of Ituri by the community;
- The incident left 4 people injured, 2 of whom were brought back to Lolwa General Hospital and 2 to Mambasa. Among the victims, there is an APS and a response agent committed to dignified and secure burial;
- In addition, there is community reluctance in the health areas of Biakato Mines and Lwemba in Mandima in Ituri, as well as in those of Aloya, Bingo and Mangina in Mabalako in the province of North Kivu;
- This reluctance leads to a low participation of people in vaccination. Nevertheless, 6 vaccination teams committed to the Aloya and Bingo health areas in North Kivu were able to vaccinate 82 people around the confirmed cases from 26 Dec 2019 to 6 Jan 2020 in these 2 health areas.

Vaccination
- 5684 people were vaccinated, until 10 Jan 2020, with the 2nd vaccine Ad26.ZEBOV / MVA-BN-Filo (Johnson & Johnson) in the 2 health areas from Karisimbi to Goma;
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018 with the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, 265 309 people have been vaccinated;

Entry point surveillance
- Since the start of the epidemic, the total number of travelers checked (temperature taken) at health checkpoints is 138 206 316;
- To date, a total of 109 entry points (PoE) and health control points (PoC) have been established in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri in order to protect the country's major cities and avoid the spread of the epidemic in neighboring countries.

Quarantined patient suspected to have Ebola tests negative

A patient in Mapel area of Wau State who was quarantined amid fears he had Ebola does not have the killer virus, health officials have confirmed.

The unidentified patient was rushed to Mapel hospital on Fri [10 Jan 2020] with bleeding from ears, a sign of Ebola. He is a soldier undergoing military trainings in Mapel.

Health officials said Friday [10 Jan 2020] that while Ebola was unlikely, they could not rule out the virus until test results came back from the capital Juba.

Simon Athuai Akot, health minister in Wau State, told Radio Tamazuj this afternoon that the results showed that it was not a case of Ebola.
"The cases were 3, but laboratory tests have confirmed that the patients at the Mapel hospital are not suffering from Ebola," Athuai said.

"Samples had been taken for analysis by our Ebola taskforce and a team from World Health Organization, but laboratory tests showed that it was not a case of Ebola. One patient who was suspected to have Ebola was just found suffering from a respiratory disease," he added.

South Sudan has a porous border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where many people move across the 2 countries for business and other activities.

South Sudan suffered an Ebola outbreak in 2004 after the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 20 cases including 5 deaths from Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) in Yambio.

- 15 Jan 2020. USA (Kentucky): Ebola suspected, but NOT Ebola
[Daily Star (abridged, edited)]
https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/ebola-fears-hit-after-student-21282948

[Byline: Sophie Bateman]

US student quarantined with unidentified disease at Barbourville Appalachian Regional Healthcare Hospital -- rumours of Ebola. This student has never been out of the US; rumours denied.

Ebola fears hit the US after a student was quarantined with a mystery disease. Kentucky state officials are investigating after a student was put into isolation with a potentially infectious disease, frightening locals and sparking fears of the deadly Ebola virus.

Kentucky state officials are investigating the case at Barbourville Appalachian Regional Healthcare Hospital along with Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.

The patient is a student at Union College. University President Dr Marcia Hawkins has asked locals to keep them "in your prayers" but said there was no immediate risk to the public.

The case has prompted rumours on social media the student has contracted the Ebola virus, which is currently ravaging parts of Africa and killed more than 11 000 people in West Africa between 2013 and 2016.

Barbourville residents told local media they were shocked by the "very scary" disease in their community.

Dr Hawkins has denied the Ebola rumours, claiming the student has not travelled out of the country or come into contact with the virus.

The disease, which is reportedly not airborne, is still unknown. Health officials are carrying out tests to identify the virus.

Barbourville ARH Hospital is still open and is currently accepting patients as normal.

The Kentucky Department for Public Health is still assessing whether there's a threat to public health, but said the wider community is not believed to be at risk as "appropriate protocols were followed at the hospital to prevent exposure to other patients."

Anyone in Barbourville experiencing symptoms of a virus, including fever, nausea, body aches or lethargy, is encouraged to seek medical assistance immediately.

Ebola symptoms include fever, a sore threat, muscle pain and headaches. Those infected often experience vomiting, diarrhoea and a rash along with poor liver and kidney function. External and internal bleeding are also common.

The virus kills, on average, 50% of the people it infects.

[For further news reporting the case is not Ebola:
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.kentucky.com/news/state/kentucky/article239288073.html.

Barbourville ARH Hospital is working with the Centers for Disease Control and the Kentucky Department for Public Health to investigate a "possible infectious disease" involving a Union College student.

The Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services said in a news release that "close contacts" of the student "have been identified and are being monitored."

The cabinet officials said that any threat to the general public "is believed to be extremely low."

Dr. Angela Dearinger, commissioner of the Department for Public Health, said in the release that officials "do not believe the wider community is at risk, and appropriate protocols were followed at the hospital to prevent exposure to other patients."

"We want to assure Kentuckians we are aware of a potential infectious disease and are working collaboratively with the local hospital as well as local, regional, and federal public health authorities to determine not only a possible cause of illness, but any steps that need to be taken to protect the health and wellbeing of our Commonwealth," Dearinger said.

Family members [of the student] had come from West Africa to visit the student several weeks ago, Kadetz told the station.

The doctor said in an interview broadcast by the radio station that he expected the student to be transferred to a facility in Atlanta.

The cabinet said the diagnosis "has not been made" and that officials are conducting medical and lab tests to do so.

Union College President Marcia Hawkins said in a statement Tuesday afternoon [14 Jan 2020] that "the student did not contract the Ebola virus, as has been speculated by posts on Facebook." Hawkins said, "the student is undergoing tests to identify a virus."

Union College has 946 undergraduates and 192 graduate students from 31 states and 19 countries, according to the college's website.

New Ebola case in DRC lifts outbreak total to 3393

A new Ebola case confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has raised the outbreak total to 3393 cases, and another death has raised the fatality total to 2235.

Officials are still investigating 480 suspected cases, according to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) online Ebola dashboard.
In a weekly update yesterday [9 Jan 2020], the WHO said 12 newly confirmed cases were reported in the outbreak from 1-7 Jan 2020, with 5 cases in Butembo, 4 in Mambasa, 2 in Mangina, and 1 in Beni. The new case in Beni is linked to a large transmission chain that originated in the Aloya health area in Mabalako.

76% of recent cases (31 of 41) have known transmission chains. "The sources of exposure for 5 new cases reported in Kalunguta Health Zone and 4 new cases reported in Mambasa Health Zone in the past 21 days are currently under investigation," the WHO said.

The DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) said in a report yesterday [9 Jan 2020] that vaccination efforts still continue, with 262 682 people vaccinated with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV, and 4802 people with Johnson & Johnson's Ebola vaccine.

[3] Vaccination
-13 Jan 2020. PREVAC-UP
[Eureka Alert (abridged, edited)]

PREVAC-UP: The Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccination extends follow-up

INSERM (Institut national de la sante et de la recherche medicale)

Public health efforts successfully stopped human-to-human transmission of Ebola virus in West Africa in 2016 after the worst Ebola outbreak in history. However, the threat of the disease is still real, as the recent Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have shown. Thus, pursuing and intensifying efforts to develop a safe and effective vaccination strategy against Ebola virus disease, with durable protection in all populations, including children, is vital.

Since August 2018, the DRC has been battling its worst Ebola outbreak, and the world's 2nd largest such outbreak, with more than 2200 lives lost and more than 3300 confirmed infections to date. This ongoing crisis highlights again the continued urgent need to develop safe and effective vaccines against the Ebola virus.

This goal has been the priority for the Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccination (PREVAC), an international consortium that recently received additional funding to scale up its research in West Africa as part of a new project known as PREVAC-UP. This initiative aims to evaluate the long-term safety, as well as the durability of humoral and cellular immune responses, of 3 different Ebola vaccine regimens previously tested by the consortium. PREVAC-UP will assess these factors for 5 years after vaccination.

The study will also evaluate the effect of co-infections, such as malaria and helminths, on the immune response to vaccination. An integrative statistical analysis of the immune response will be used to explore the mechanism of action of the vaccines and to identify early correlates of durable antibody induction. "This programme is expected to significantly impact Ebola prevention and control in adults and children in Africa. The study will also strengthen the capacity for science relevant to the development and evaluation of new vaccines in sub-Saharan Africa," Dr Yazdan Yazdanpanah, PREVAC Principal Investigator, says.

The project is co-funded by the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP2) programme supported by the European Union. Besides the EDCTP2 grant, PREVAC-UP benefits from co-funding from Inserm, the NIAID, the LSHTM and the COMAHS, as well as host country support from Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Mali.

PREVAC results expected in 2020

PREVAC-UP follows up on the work already carried out by the PREVAC consortium since March 2017 in West Africa. Working in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Mali, the team conducted a randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre Phase 2 trial -- one of the largest Ebola vaccine trials to date -- using the recently WHO prequalified rVSVÎ"G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine from Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, Corp., and an investigational 2-dose vaccine regimen (Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo) developed by Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V., part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, in collaboration with Bavarian Nordic.

The aim was to study the safety and immunogenicity over 12 months of 3 different vaccination strategies involving these vaccines in adults and children one year and older. In total, PREVAC enrolled 4789 people from the 4 countries, with the enrolment of 2802 participants (1401 adults and 1401 children) in the main phase of the trial completed in December 2018. The 1st results on immunogenicity at 12 months after vaccination are expected in the summer 2020. Importantly, the retention rate of the participants is very high (95% after 12 months). "This reflects the great commitment of all the local professionals and shows the high level of collaboration between all the partners involved in the project as well as the interest in the population to receive an Ebola vaccine, and successful community engagement strategies," Dr. Yazdanpanah says.

PREVAC-UP will now bring much needed additional data on these different vaccination strategies, helping to promote the safest and most efficient approach to protect vulnerable populations in countries threatened by Ebola.

Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo): Red Cross volunteers attacked during Ebola burial

DRC Red Cross teams have faced incidents of violence and aggression from communities resisting safe and dignified burial protocols since the start of the Ebola outbreak.

Two volunteers from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) Red Cross were seriously injured following an attack during a safe and dignified burial of a suspected Ebola case near Mambasa, in eastern DR Congo on Mon 13 Jan 2020. The volunteers are now in hospital, receiving medical care and psychosocial support.

DRC Red Cross teams have faced incidents of violence and aggression from communities resisting safe and dignified burial protocols since the start of the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri. In this most recent attack, the family had consented to the burial, but rumours and panic quickly spread among the community resulting in a violent assault against the Red Cross team.

Gregoire Mateso Mbuta, President of the DR Congo Red Cross Society said:
"This incident is a stark reminder of the serious risks our volunteers face when they carry out the dangerous task of safe and dignified burials. While we deplore any violence towards our volunteers or staff, we understand firsthand, the fear and frustration that communities harbour, and shall continue to render the needed services to the affected populations."

The current Ebola outbreak, which began on 1 Aug 2018, is unfolding in an area affected by a 2 decades-long conflict that has claimed countless lives and raised fear and hostility towards responders.

Building community trust and acceptance has been at the core of the Red Cross's Ebola response operations. This investment has paid off. Since the beginning of the outbreak, nearly 20 000 successful safe and dignified burials have been conducted with a consistently high success rate.

Red Cross volunteers continue to work within affected communities, listening to concerns and gathering feedback that is then analysed and used to provide improved support to people in need. As a result, community resistance for safe and dignified burials has drastically declined over the course of the operation.

Nicole Fassina, Ebola Operations Manager for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said: "While we experienced an overall improvement in the community's acceptance of burials, this attack underscores why we cannot become complacent. The Red Cross will continue to engage and involve communities in the Ebola response if we want to bring this outbreak to end."
