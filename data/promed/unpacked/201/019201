At least 453 pigs (hogs) have so far perished in the Old Jeshwang
area alone during the outbreak of the deadly swine fever in early
August [2007].
The pig breeders in Old Jeshwang that I spoke to told me that all
their herds died within a period of a month during the outbreak.
Estimate of the loss is almost GMD (dalasi) 2 million (approx USD 91
530) assuming that each pig is worth GMD 4000 (USD 183).
The most affected breeder lamented a loss of almost 200 pigs within a
month. These pig breeders lamented their dilemma concerning their
economic situation. They said they depend on the monies derived from
selling their pigs to make ends meet.
They pointed out that all their school-going children benefit from
the incomes from pig breeding. They noted that they still don't have
means or ways to solve their economic problems. [A woman] lamented
the decision by most of them to become domestic servants to make ends
meet. [A man] lamented the worst outbreak of swine fever he had ever
witnessed in the nearly a decade he had been in the business. They
asserted that it is very difficult for them to get rid of the dead
pigs, noting that they dug pits at the swamps to bury the dead ones.
