The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed 2 more cases of Marburg virus in Ghana, a senior WHO official said on Wednesday [27 Jul 2022], 2 weeks after the country reported its 1st outbreak of the highly infectious Ebola-like disease.

Those first 2 cases, in southern Ghana's Ashanti region, both had symptoms including diarrhoea, fever, nausea and vomiting, before dying in hospital, the WHO said previously. "We have 2 additional cases," Doctor Ibrahima Soce Fall told journalists on Wednesday [27 Jul 2022].

The outbreak is only the 2nd in West Africa. The 1st ever case of the virus in the region was detected last year [2021] in Guinea.

Soce Fall said information received from Ghana suggested there were around 180 contacts being followed up and WHO teams were making sure that none were missed. The virus is transmitted to people from fruit bats and spreads among humans through direct contact with bodily fluids, surfaces and materials, the WHO said.

Soce Fall said the cases had been reported in 3 different regions in Ghana, creating a "very difficult" situation. "Although the cases are not high at the moment, ...we need to make sure that every hotspot can be stopped otherwise it will become more complex," he said.

[One hopes that the tracking measures will be adequate to promptly identify and treat any who show signs or symptoms of Marburg virus infection. One also hopes that the care providers have adequate PPE to avoid becoming infected themselves.

As noted above and in the previous post, this is not the 1st time that Marburg virus has been found in West Africa. Last year (2021) there were 2 confirmed cases of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in Gueckedou, the Republic of Guinea. Although these were the 1st confirmed human infections with this virus in West Africa, the virus was found previously in neighboring Sierra Leone in 5 Egyptian rousette, or fruit, bats (_Rousettus aegyptiacus_) (see Marburg virus disease - Sierra Leone: bat 20200125.6916732 and Amman BR, Bird H, Bakarr IA, et al. Nat Commun. 2020; 11: 510; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14327-8).

Tests for Marburg virus infections should be among those for hemorrhagic diseases that are endemic in West Africa for timely and accurate differential diagnosis. - Mod.TY
