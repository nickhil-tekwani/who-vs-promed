So far 50 people have been treated in various hospitals in Kaposvar,
Pecs, Szekesfehervar, Siofok, Tapolca and Dombovar for salmonella
poisoning apparently caused from food served at a christening
[baptism] party in Kaposvar on Mon 23 Oct 2006. The testing of food
samples is still underway, but the organism has been identified in
the patients. The food at the christening was ordered from an
unlicensed restaurant.

[A food survey of the guests who were affected and unaffected could
be very useful in identifying the food vehicle.
The area involved in this point source outbreak is in southwestern Hungary:
