Some comments on the recent posting ALGAL TOXIN, POTABLE WATER - USA
(FLORIDA)
--------------------------------------------
The quoted newspaper report seems to imply there are no established methods
for removing cyanobacteria or their toxins from drinking water, however the
World Health Organization (WHO) has produced a comprehensive text on the
topic in 1999 "Toxic Cyanobacteria in Water: A Guide to their Public Health
Consequences, Monitoring and Management"
<http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/Water_quality/CYAN.html>
The toxins are mostly contained inside the algal cells and are released
when the cells die and lyse. The practice of dosing affected reservoirs
with algicide to kill cyanobacterial blooms results in a release of the
intracellular toxins into the water. This practice should generally be
avoided if the reservoir is in use for drinking water supply. If there is
no alternative water supply available, the water off-take should be moved
(in location and/or depth) to avoid the areas/layers of high algal density.
In order to minimize the amount of dissolved toxin in the water, water
treatment methods avoiding cell breakage are preferable (i.e. not
pre-chlorinating before filtration).
Well operated conventional water treatment plants (with coagulation
/sedimentation /filtration processes) can remove the intact algal cells
quite effectively. Both microcystin and cylindrospermopsin can be destroyed
by chlorination, and they can also be removed by activated carbon
filtration.
Regarding the potential health effects of exposure to microcystin at levels
above the WHO Guideline Value - it should be noted the Guideline Value
relates to lifelong exposure, not acute exposure. The Guideline Value is
calculated on the basis a person could drink water containing 1
microgram/litre of microcystin every day for 70 years without suffering
adverse health effects. Short term exposure to drinking water several-fold
above the Guideline Value is very unlikely to be harmful as the Guideline
includes a safety factor of 1000 from the NOEAL (No Observed Adverse Effect
Level) derived from animal toxicology studies.
The report also made reference to over 50 fatalities among dialysis
patients in Brazil. This occurred when a dialysis clinic obtained water
trucked directly from a contaminated reservoir and used it after passage
through its own filtration system. The clinic filtration system was poorly
maintained and not effective for removing toxins. Patients received a high
dose of toxins due to the large volume of water used for hemo-dialysis (150
litres per dialysis session x 3 sessions per week) and bypassing of the
usual barriers for oral exposure (destruction of toxins by stomach acid and
poor absorption via the gut). A similar dialysis clinic in the same town
using treated municipal water (conventional alum flocculation, sand
filtration and chlorination) from the same reservoir did not experience
illnesses or deaths.
