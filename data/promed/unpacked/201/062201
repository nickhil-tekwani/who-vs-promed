Bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Romania
-----------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 7 Mar 2016 [published 8 Mar 2016] from Dr Marius Grigore, Director, Head of Unit Animal Health Department General Sanitary Veterinary Directorate, National Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Authority, Bucharest, Romania

Report type: follow-up report no. 6
[Routine, repeated data have been deleted; to see them, please go to the source URL above].

Epidemiological comments: in 2014, there were 2 cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in Romania: the 1st of them notified in Cluj County on 20 Jun 2014 which is still open, knowing that the case is under Prosecutor's investigation. Therefore, the release of any information is currently impossible. Whilst there have been no further cases reported, the event should remain open. The 2nd case in Covasna County, notified on 23 Dec 2014, was closed on 17 Feb 2015, when the animal registration has been removed from the database. At the moment, the only case [that remains open] is that notified on 20 Jun 2014.

[The epidemiological comments above seem to follow ProMED-mail's request for clarification (see archive no. 20160307.4074235) of the BSE situation in Romania, as detailed in Romania's follow-up report no. 5, published 4 Mar 2016.

The detailed history of this event, involving 2 cases, as reported to the OIE by the Romanian authorities in an Immediate notification (20 Jun 214) and 5 follow-up reports (between 27 Oct 2014 and 4 Mar 2016), is reviewed in the commentary of posting 20160307.4074235.

The 6 OIE reports mentioned above and an interactive map showing the locations of the 2 cases are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=15456.

The following information remains pending:
1. The final details (origin? destruction? cohorts?) pertaining to the 1st case (Cluj, 20 Jun 2014). These are expected to become available when the Prosecutor's investigation is completed

2. What was the identity of the BSE prion involved in the 2nd case (Covasna county, 23 Dec 2014, reported "closed" on 17 Feb 2015), whether "classical" or "atypical"? - Mod.AS
