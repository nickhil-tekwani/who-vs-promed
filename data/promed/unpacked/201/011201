Malaria cases continue to climb
-----------------------------------
New data from the Ministry of Health show that the number of malaria
cases reported since last December's [2006] outbreak has increased to
340. The figure includes 4 new cases, which have been identified
since the start of this week.
The information was released Wednesday [4 Apr 2007] night by Health
Minister Horace Dalley, who said the communities of Greenwich Town
and Tivoli Gardens remain a challenge even as the rate of increase in
malaria cases continues to decline.
Addressing the Standing Finance Committee of Parliament, Mr. Dalley
said while the vector control program has been intensified in these
communities, it appears that the breed of mosquito transmitting the
disease is resistant to the insecticide. Noting that all persons
diagnosed with the disease have been treated, Mr. Dalley disclosed
that a team will be visiting Jamaica over the next few weeks to
assess the situation.
Responding to queries from Opposition Spokesman on Health Dr. Ken
Baugh, Mr. Dalley said funds are available to fight the spread of
communicable diseases, namely malaria, HIV/AIDS and avian flu.

[ProMED last reported 280 cases on 10 Feb 2007. The risk still seems
to be limited to certain areas of Kingston, and so far malaria
prophylaxis is recommended by the CDC to travelers staying overnight
in Jamaica. - Mod.EP]
