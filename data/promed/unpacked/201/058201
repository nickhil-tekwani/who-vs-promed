A seaweed farmer from Nusa Lembongan Island, Klungkung regency
[Bali], shows off a handful of seaweed infected by a disease locally
known as 'ais ais'. The attack, which occurs annually between January
and May, is currently causing a huge decline in seaweed production in
the Nusa Penida islets, which comprise Nusa Lembongan, Nusa Ceningan,
and Nusa Penida. [The farmer] said she usually harvests a total of 1
ton of seaweed each month. "But now I can only get around 300
kilograms [660 lb] a month," she said.

The farmers are helpless in trying to figure out ways to eliminate
the annual disease. Most of the islanders are seaweed farmers. Gusti
Udayasa, a field officer with the Klungkung Animal Husbandry,
Fisheries and Maritime Affairs Agency, said his office could only
suggest that farmers discard the infected seaweed immediately to
prevent the disease from spreading.

[Seaweed species are used in many maritime countries as a source of
food, for industrial applications and as a fertiliser. The major
utilisation of these plants (for example _Porphyra_ and _Chondrus_
species) as food is in Asia where seaweed cultivation has become an
important industry in some areas, including Bali. Seaweeds, both
farmed and collected from the wild, can form an important part of the
diet in tropical coastal communities and are eaten cooked as
vegetables, fresh as salad components, or dried and ground to a meal.

Seaweeds can be affected by viruses, bacteria, parasitic algae, and
fungal infections (for example _Pythium_, _Petersenia_, and
_Phycomelaina_ species). However, little is known about their
diseases and from the item above the type of pathogen causing the
recurring outbreaks cannot be implied.
