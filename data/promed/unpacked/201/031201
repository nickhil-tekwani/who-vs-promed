Cassava brown streak virus invades Adjumani
-------------------------------------------
The Department of Agriculture in Adjumani District (Northern Region) has confirmed an outbreak of cassava brown streak disease. Preliminary findings show that the viral disease has already hit 3 villages.

The district agriculture officer said, "The disease has spread due to movement of cassava stalks which are not approved by extension workers." The disease was first reported in Yumbe District and the transportation of the cassava stems has not been controlled.

Farmers have been asked to stop cultivating 4 cassava varieties including TME14, TME204, NASE10, and NASE12 [varieties with CMD resistance -- see comment below] because they are at risk of the brown streak disease.

Cassava is a major staple food in Uganda with the annual cassava production estimated at 5.5 million tonnes. However, there are fears that the increasing cases of diseases on many cassava varieties could lead to decline in production and famine in the country.

[Cassava brown streak (or root rot) disease can be caused by _Cassava brown streak virus_ (CBSV; genus _Ipomovirus_) and the more recently identified _Ugandan cassava brown streak virus_. It is considered a threat to the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, where the crop is a major factor in food security. Symptoms may include leaf chlorosis, stem necrosis, and yellow/brown corky necrosis in the starch bearing tissue of roots. Leaves may appear healthy even when the roots have rotted away. Total crop losses of 20-80 per cent have been reported, and losses in individual root weight of up to 70 per cent have been observed in susceptible cultivars.

The virus is transmitted by the whitefly vector _Bemisia tabaci_ and is spread to new areas by infected cassava cuttings. Disease management includes pathogen exclusion, removal of infected plants, use of virus-free seed tubers for planting, and vector control, but these measures may be difficult to implement in developing countries. Resistant varieties are being developed for specific local requirements.

CBSV is a particular threat to new varieties developed with resistance to Cassava mosaic disease (CMD; caused by a number of species and strains in the genus _Begomovirus_ and transmitted like CBSV). A new CBSV strain adapted to higher altitudes has emerged and is affecting additional CMD resistant cultivars (ProMED-mail post 20100525.1735). The crop varieties mentioned above are examples of CMD resistant cultivars under threat from CBSV in Uganda.

The joint management of both diseases has become a major challenge in the region and globally (ProMED-mail post 20110829.2643) since development of crop varieties with stable resistance to multiple viruses is particularly difficult (ProMED-mail post 20090709.2463).
