Over the past 3 days, China reported 14 new H7N9 influenza infections, including 4 in children and 3 fatal cases. Lunar New Year [31 Jan 2014] celebrations are winding down in China, and health officials are watching to see what impact that may have on the pace of human cases. Global health groups have warned that the surge of human cases could continue, fueled by increases in poultry trade and transport, as well as heavy volume of travel as families gather to observe the holiday season.

Six of the latest cases are from Guangdong province, continuing a strong 2nd-wave tilt toward the mainland's southernmost areas. In the 1st wave, locations north of that area were driving most of the outbreak activity: Shanghai, Jiangsu province, and Zhejiang province. China's steady stream of H7N9 cases has averaged about 5 to 7 a day over the past few weeks, and the latest reports puts the total close to the 300 case mark since the disease was first detected in people last spring [2013]. For comparison, it took H5N1 avian flu -- another closely watched virus that can pass from poultry to people -- 4 years for the global total to reach 263 cases. China passed that mark for H7N9 last week [week of 27 Jan 2014] after less than a year of outbreak activity.

Latest case announcements: news of the latest 14 cases appeared in provincial health ministry announcements translated and posted by Avian Flu Diary (AFD), an infectious disease blog, and 5 of the cases were also covered in the latest disease update today [3 Feb 2014] from the World Health Organization (WHO). 3 more deaths were included in the reports: those of a 63 year old man and a 48 year old man from Guangdong province, and of a 59 year old man from Hunan province. The 48 year old's infection was first confirmed on [15 Jan 2014], according to the FluTrackers infectious disease news message board. 6 of the latest case-patients are from Guangdong province, and 3 of them are children, a 2 year old girl, a 5 year old boy, and a 6 year old boy. Aside from the 63 year old man who died from his infections, the other cases involve a 37 year old man and a 76 year old woman.

The 6 year old boy's illness was detected on [28 Jan 2014] as he was traveling through a border point between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, according to the WHO report. He lives in Shenzhen [Guangdong province] and started having symptoms on [27 Jan 2014]. His symptoms are described as mild, and he is in stable condition and is being treated and isolated at home. The investigation shows that he had been exposed to live poultry. Meanwhile, the 5 year old boy, from the city of Zhaoqing [Guangdong province], got sick on [29 Jan 2014] and was hospitalized the same day. He is in a stable condition. WHO said he had been exposed to a live poultry market.

The 2 year old girl, whose illness was confirmed yesterday [2 Feb 2014], is from Zhongshan City [Guangdong province], where she is hospitalized in stable condition, according to AFD's translation of today's health ministry report. The 4th child -- an 8 year old girl -- is from Hunan province, which also reported 2 adult case-patients, a 38 year old man and a 59 year old man who died from his infection. Zhejiang province reported 3 new cases, all involving adult men, ages 80, 54, and 44. Fujian province also reported 2 more lab-confirmed cases, also in men, ages 27 and 35.

The 14 new cases boost the H7N9 outbreak's total to 291, according to a running total compiled by FluTrackers.com [http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=2959]. Of those, 155 have come in the 2nd outbreak wave since October [2013], compared with 136 in the 1st wave last spring [2013]. The 3 latest deaths lift the unofficial fatality total to 64. WHO's statement today [3 Feb 2014] also includes details on 5 case notifications it received from China on [31 Jan 2014]. In addition, a separate statement from the agency on [1 Feb 2014] fleshes out new details on 7 cases reported from China on [30 Jan 2014]. Of the 16 patients reported in the 2 WHO statements, 11 had been exposed to live-poultry markets, 3 had been exposed to live poultry, and the source wasn't known for 2. Ages range from 5 years to 82 years. 12 of the patients are male, and 4 are female. 11 of the patients are in critical condition, one is serious, one is stable, and one has a mild infection. 2 of the patients died from their illnesses. Illness-onset dates range from [13 Jan 2014] through [29 Jan 2014]. The patients in the 2 WHO reports are from 5 different Chinese provinces, all in the south eastern part of the country. They include 7 from Guangdong, 6 from Zhejiang, and 1 each from Guangxi, Hunan, and Jiangsu.

[Second wave human cases of avian H7N9 influenza virus infection now exceed the number of cases in the 1st wave. The latest estimate of human case has reaches 291 with 155 occurring in the 2nd wave. The unofficial number of deaths has now reached 64. The Chinese New Year celebrations are now coming to an end and it will be interesting to observe if the predicted increased number of cases during these celebrations will now begin to decline. - Mod.CP
