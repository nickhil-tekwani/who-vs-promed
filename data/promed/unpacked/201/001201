Scientists warn of CJD risk in vaccines given to children
The [UK] government is preparing to warn doctors that British blood
products, including vaccines given to children, could be at risk of
contamination from CJD. A letter being drafted by Ken Calman, the chief
medical officer, will reveal that scientific advisers to a meeting of the
Committee on Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP), a pan-European advisory
body, this week have concluded that all products derived from British blood
- including vaccines - could transmit the disease.
British experts on CJD are anxious to emphasise that the life-saving
benefits of blood transfusions and vaccinations against killer diseases far
outweigh the risk of CJD, which is believed to be minimal. However, the
newly identified form of beef-related [nv]CJD can theoretically pass from
person to person and could be more infectious than "classic" CJD.
Europe may impose a ban on the export of British blood and blood-derived
protein called albumin prepared from donor plasma, which is used in
pharmaceutical products including vaccines. This could provoke a political
outcry. Noel Wadhion, the committee's spokesman, said no formal response
would be made by the CPMP until the end of the week. The principal vaccine
containing human serum albumin is for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), and
is received by millions of children. British supplies are produced in
America, which has no cases of the new variant of CJD. However, British
albumin is used in other vaccines and exported to vaccine manufacturers
elsewhere.
Calman said blood collected here has a safety record second to none in terms
of risk of transmitting hepatitis, HIV or other viruses. "We don't know that
[sic] the theoretical risk of CJD transmission is from blood, if it's there
at all," he said. "The letter to doctors isn't finalised. We have discussed
the consequences of this report, but it depends on the final statements from
the European committee and advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines
here. To get a blood product from another country which has a high risk of
some other infection doesn't seem a particularly good idea to me."
Calman's letter will guide doctors on how to explain to patients what is
known so far about the risk from new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(nvCJD) which, it is emphasised, is far outweighed by the dangers of not
having the treatment. Ministers believe the public should be informed of any
risk of BSE infection, however slight - as they were over beef on the bone,
banned from sale in December.
So far there have only been 23 confirmed cases of the so-called nvCJD [in
the UK]. However, [some] scientists think there are many more undiagnosed
victims. A World Health Organisation (WHO) meeting two weeks ago concluded
the possibility of a "significant nvCJD epidemic" in 10 years can no longer
be ignored. Martin Ziedler, an adviser on the disease at the WHO, said
calculations a year ago, when there were just 14 confirmed cases of nvCJD,
indicated there could be up to 80,000 more British victims. Now it is
impossible to predict the possible scale of any epidemic.

[One's interpretation of the risk of acquiring nvCJD from blood depends very
much one one's beliefs as to the future incidence of this disease. To date,
the evidence for risk from blood transfusions has been theoretical only and
extremely slight at that. While the BSE epidemic is coming to an end and to
my knowledge none of the 23 nvCJD cases have been ascribed to blood
transfusions, those who predict very large numbers to come may claim that
those thousands "incubating the disease" were to give blood ... etc. Present
official statements about future nvCJD cases are modest though hedged. I
have checked the original Sunday Times article, in case Ralph had modified
it in any way (he hadn't), and the authors are confused over CJD and nvCJD.
There has never been any evidence for acquiring CJD from blood
transfusions. - Mod.MHJ]
