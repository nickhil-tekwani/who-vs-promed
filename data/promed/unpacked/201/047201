The mango season has begun on a sour note this year [2008] as the
untimely rain has damaged the crop in Krishna district. Farmers, who
expected a good crop yield this season, are in despair now.

Horticultural officials put the total mango crop acreage in Krishna
district at 62 000 hectares (153 205 acres). Banginapalli, Thotapuri,
and Nuzvid Chinnarasalu varieties of mango raised in the region have
good demand in the market. Banginapalli has been afflicted with
'mangu' [bacterial black spot] disease due to the unseasonal rain.
Mangu causes black spots on the fruit. Mangoes hit by mangu will not
get a good price, said assistant director of horticulture MV Madhusudhan.

P Balakoti of Sayampalem village looks dejected as 90 percent of his
Banginapalli crop was affected with mangu. Mohammed Iqbal, a
commission agent, said the crop yield was also low this season and
consumers were showing reluctance to buy mangu-hit Banginapalli.
Jamuna Das, a trader from Rajasthan, said he was not expecting a good
price this season due to the poor quality of the fruit. K Durga Rao,
a bearer, said earlier, they used to get hundred truck loads of the
fruit a day. Now, they are hardly getting 40 truck loads of the fruit, he said.

[Bacterial black spot (BBS, also called bacterial canker) of mango is
caused by _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _mangiferaeindicae_. It was
first described from South Africa in 1909 and is now known to be
present also in a number of countries in the Asian-Pacific region and
South America. It is an economically important disease with up to 50
percent yield losses reported. The pathogen can infect leaves, stems
and fruit, with fruit symptoms being the most economically damaging.
Symptoms include small, irregular, water-soaked lesions on fruit,
which soon become raised and may crack open releasing bacterial ooze.
Stem lesions appear as blackened cankers, which may crack lengthwise.
Leaves also show small water soaked lesions, which become angular and
raised, increase in size, and may coalesce to form large necrotic
patches. Their appearance is characteristic and can be used to
distinguish BBS from anthracnose, a fungal disease, which forms flat,
rounded lesions.

The pathogen lives as an epiphyte but occurs in high concentrations
in leaf and stem lesions. The bacterium is essentially a wound
pathogen, although it can infect through natural openings. Incidence
is increased by micro-wound development and may therefore be severe
in windy areas without windbreaks, when insect populations are high,
or in trees that lack vigour. The disease can be prevalent in both
low and high rainfall areas and is spread by wind-driven rain,
splashing water, insects, and mechanical means.

Disease management is difficult and may include cultural practices,
phytosanitary measures, use of clean planting and grafting material,
and bacteriocidal sprays. Infected nursery trees have been a major
source of BBS in new orchards. Susceptibility to BBS varies between
mango cultivars, but no completely resistant varieties are known.
