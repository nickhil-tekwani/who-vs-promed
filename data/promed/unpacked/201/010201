[The chronology of the above outbreak is in need of clarification: Could the FMD virus isolation have been completed in the distant reference laboratory on the same day the outbreak reportedly started?

China has reported, since 18 Feb 2013, 10 outbreaks of the "New strain" FMDV serotype A (topotype ASIA, genotype/strain SEA 97) in 4 separate, distant provinces as follows:

Province / starting date / species affected / number of outbreaks / No culled animals per species / current status
1. Guangdong / 18 Feb 2013 / swine / 1 / 948 swine / resolved 27 Mar 2013
2. Qinghai / 15 Mar 2013 / cattle / 2 / 502 cattle, 78 sheep / resolved 7 May 2013
3. Xinjiang / 15 Mar 2013 / cattle / 3 / 406 cattle, 176 sheep / continuing
4. Tibet / 12 Apr 2013 / cattle / 4 (including the one reported in this posting) / 884 cattle, 56 sheep & goats / continuing

The locations of the FMD-A outbreaks in China are available in separate OIE maps for each province; there is no common, county-wide map for all the said outbreaks since China reports the disease situation in each province as a separate entity.

The said virus strain has also been identified in Russia, on China's border (Zabajkal'skij Kray, at the beginning of March 2013). Another penetration, to Kazakhstan, has been recently suspected, but serotyping and genotyping of the virus are pending.

The genotypes of 2 isolates of this strain, from pigs and cattle, are available at
http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2013/WRLMEG-2013-00009%20A%20PR%20China%202013.pdf and http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2013/WRLMEG-2013-00004%20A%20PR%20China%202013-2.pdf.

For the control of this "New strain," China opted for a stamping-out policy; reportedly, no vaccination is applied. - Mod.AS
