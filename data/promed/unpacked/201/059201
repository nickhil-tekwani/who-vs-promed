Equine herpes strikes North
---------------------------
Horse owners have been urged to watch their animals after several
cases of equine herpesvirus in Tasmania.

Equine herpes type 1 [EHV-1] has been diagnosed in several brood
mares on a northern Tasmanian property. The state's chief veterinary
officer, Rod Andrewartha, said people must isolate horses with clinical signs.

"EHV-1 is a viral disease that can cause neurological signs and
abortions in pregnant mares and in some cases it can cause a number
of mares in an affected mob to abort," Dr Andrewartha said.

"Some of the affected mares were showing ataxia that is, they were
unsteady when they walked and had their feet wide apart before the
abortions were seen."

He said anyone seeing ataxia or abortions in horses should keep them
away from other horses and contact a vet. If a wait for the vet is
expected, the aborted foetus should be put somewhere cool in a strong
plastic bag so that the vet can check it and take samples. Gloves
should be used and hands washed.

Dr Andrewartha said horses infected usually kept a latent infection
for life, but it could be triggered by a combination of pregnancy and stress.

To help prevent the disease, new horses should not be put with
pregnant mares and unnecessary stress should be avoided.

EHV-1 is seen occasionally in the state and is a notifiable disease,
so should be reported to an all-hours disease hotline of 1800 675 888.

[Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) and EHV-4 comprise 2 antigenically
distinct groups of viruses previously referred to as subtypes 1 and 2
of EHV-1. Both viruses are ubiquitous in horse populations worldwide
and produce an acute febrile respiratory disease upon primary
infection, characterized by rhinopharyngitis and tracheobronchitis.
Outbreaks of respiratory disease occur annually among foals in areas
with concentrated horse populations. Most of these outbreaks in
weanlings are caused by strains of EHV-4. The age, seasonal, and
geographic distributions vary and are determined by immune status and
horse population. In individual horses, the outcome of exposure is
determined by viral strain, immune status, pregnancy status, and
possibly age. Infection of pregnant mares with EHV-4 rarely results
in abortion.

Outbreaks with specific strains of EHV-1 infection result in
neurologic disease. Clinical signs vary from mild incoordination and
posterior paresis to severe posterior paralysis with recumbency, loss
of bladder and tail function, and loss of sensation to the skin in
the perineal and inguinal areas. In exceptional cases, the paralysis
may progress to quadriplegia and death. Prognosis depends on severity
of signs and the period of recumbency. Neurologic disease associated
with EHV-1 is thought to occur more commonly in mares after abortion
storms, but it has been reported in barren mares, stallions,
geldings, and foals after an outbreak of EHV-1 respiratory infection.

For prevention and control of EHV-4- and EHV-1-related diseases,
management practices that reduce viral spread are recommended. New
horses (or those returning from other premises) should be isolated
for 3-4 weeks before commingling with resident horses, especially
pregnant mares. Management-related stress-inducing circumstances
should be avoided to prevent recrudescence of latent virus. Pregnant
mares should be maintained in a group away from the weanlings,
yearlings, and horses out of training. In an outbreak of respiratory
disease or abortion, affected horses should be isolated and
appropriate measures taken for disinfection of contaminated premises.
No horse should leave the premises for 3 weeks after recovery of the
last clinical case.

Parenterally administered modified live vaccines are licensed in some
countries but banned in others. An inactivated vaccine is the only
product currently recommended by the manufacturer as an aid in
prevention of EHV-1 abortion. Vaccine should be administered during
moths 3, 5, 7, and 9 of pregnancy. Humoral immunity induced by
vaccination against EHV-1 and EHV-4 generally persists for only 2-4
months. Antigenic variation within each virus type means that
available vaccines do not cover all strains to which horses can be
exposed. Vaccination should begin when foals are 3-4 months old and,
depending on the vaccine used, a 2nd dose given 4-8 weeks later.
Booster vaccinations may be indicated as often as every 3-6 months
through maturity. Vaccination programs against EHV-1 should include
all horses on the premises.
