The Macau Health Bureau (SS) was warned by Chinese health authorities that a fatal bird flu human infection case had been registered in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, bordering with Guangdong province.

A 44-year-old Chinese driver from Hechi in Guangxi Zhuang was said to have contracted the influenza A virus H5N6 subtype, having shown symptoms on [18 Oct 2018] and sent for medical treatment on [21 Oct 2018].

Separate news reports have indicated that the man has died on [27 Oct 2018] from severe respiratory illness.

According to the SS, since 2014 bird flu cases have been registered in the Chinese provinces of Sichun, Guangdong, Yunnan, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, and in Guangxi Zhuang, with Macau health authorities having maintained close communication with health entities in China and neighboring regions, and with the World Health Organization (WHO).

Human contraction with the influenza A virus H5N6 subtype was first reported in China in early May 2014, with all known cases having happened in this country.

This avian influenza virus originated from influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. It is considered a low virulent strain for avian populations, but with the clinical manifestation in humans considered severe, with acute respiratory illness and pneumonia able to occur.

The SS warned residents to avoid contact with birds and in case of contact to wash hands immediately, while avoiding to buy or transport unverified birds.

Residents were also advised to avoid consuming meat, offal, blood products, and eggs from poorly cooked poultry, pay attention to personal hygiene and wash your hands frequently.

"If you have symptoms of fever, coughing, and difficulty breathing, among others, you should wear a mask and go to the doctor as soon as possible and should tell you in detail the history of travel and contact with animals', the SS informed.

["There are at least 2 different lineages of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N6) circulating in poultry. The Asian lineage strains of HPAI H5N6 have been responsible for outbreaks in poultry in China and South East Asia since 2014 and are associated with severe human disease. During 2017, a 2nd lineage of HPAI H5N6 was identified in birds in Korea and across Europe. The European strain is considered unrelated to the Asian lineage, and has not been associated with any human cases to date." (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/avian-influenza-ah5n6-risk-assessment/avian-influenza-ah5n6-risk-assessment).

The distinction of low and high pathogenicity is generally referred to in relation to disease severity in poultry only. There are many factors that impact the pathogenicity of avian or swine origin viruses in mammalian hosts and therefore risk assessment should include both genetic and phenotypic characterization of these viruses (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5750386/)

In April 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) first reported a case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N6) from China. As of 26 Jan 2018, a total of 19 human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported from 9 different provinces across mainland China. 3 of these cases were in children, 2 of whom had only mild illness. Of the remaining 16 adult cases, all had a severe illness and at least 10 were fatal.

The majority of human cases of A(H5N6) in mainland China are known to have had contact with birds or their environments prior to becoming ill and there is currently no evidence of human-to-human transmission. WHO considers that the H5 avian influenza viruses have not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans and therefore the risk of sustained human-to-human transmission is low at present (https://jvi.asm.org/content/early/2017/04/06/JVI.00143-17).

There have been no reported cases of human infection among farm workers, or those involved in the culling, cleanup, and disposal of infected birds during previously reported HPAI A(H5N6) incidents in poultry outbreaks. However, there is a theoretical risk of human infections due to occupational exposure, and a precautionary approach is advised and HPAI H5N6 viruses pose a potential pandemic threat.

The internationally recognised definition of avian influenza in poultry, as presented in OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code (article 10.4.1. in chapter 10.4., "Infection with avian influenza viruses"), is the following: "Avian influenza: an infection of poultry caused by any influenza A virus of the H5 or H7 subtypes or by any influenza A virus with an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) greater than 1.2 (or as an alternative at least 75% mortality) as described below.

"These viruses are divided into high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAI) and low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses: HPAI viruses have an IVPI [intravenous pathogenicity index] in 6-week-old chickens greater than 1.2 or, as an alternative, cause at least 75% mortality in 4-to 8-week-old chickens infected intravenously. H5 and H7 viruses which do not have an IVPI of greater than 1.2 or cause less than 75% mortality in an intravenous lethality test should be sequenced to determine whether multiple basic amino acids are present at the cleavage site of the haemagglutinin molecule (HA0); if the amino acid motif is similar to that observed for other high pathogenicity avian influenza isolates, the isolate being tested should be considered as high pathogenicity avian influenza virus. LPAI viruses are all influenza A viruses of H5 and H7 subtypes that are not high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses."

The 1st human infection with (A)H5N6 avian influenza virus was reported from central China (Sichuan province) on 4 May 2014; the patient died. The regional Ministry of Agriculture published a report indicating that an LPAI H5N6 virus strain was isolated from samples collected from the poultry holding of the patient. The low pathogenicity (LPAI) was based upon the recorded clinical picture in the chickens (apparent morbidity rate 0.07 percent). However, following further investigations, the strain was confirmed to be HPAI H5N6. This was explained in the reference below as follows: "The virus was reassorted with the HA gene of clade 2.3.4.4 H5, the internal genes of clade 2.3.2.1 H5, and the NA gene of the H6N6 avian virus. The cleavage site of the HA gene contained multiple basic amino acids, indicating that the novel H5N6 virus was highly pathogenic in chicken."

Accordingly, the initial notification of the event to the OIE, referring to the causative agent as LPAI H5N6, was amended. Since 2014, all H5N6 events in China's poultry are designated as HPAI. During 2018, HPAI H5N6 outbreaks in poultry or cases in wild birds in China have been addressed in 8 ProMED-mail postings (listed below); the most recent one, dated 26 Oct 2018, notified an outbreak in Hubei, where 6.37% apparent morbidity rate was recorded (20181026.6112789).
