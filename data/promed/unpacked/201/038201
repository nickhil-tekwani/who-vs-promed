France: 2 Cases of Locally Contracted West Nile Virus Infection
--------------------------------------------------
Health experts stated that the 1st cases of human infection by West
Nile virus seen in France for 40 years had originated in the country
and had not been contracted abroad. A case reported on 6 Oct 2003
concerned a man who had visited Spain during the 2- to 14-day
incubation period. After being treated in hospital the patient, who
lives in the south of France, was able to go home. Health authorities
now report that in August 2003 he man's wife showed symptoms of a
benign form of the illness, which is spread by mosquitoes. Unlike her
husband she had not left her home during the incubation period. These
new elements "confirm the hypothesis of a locally-based infection ...
and therefore of the circulation of the virus at the end of the
summer period in the northeast region of the Department of the Var
[in the southeast of France]."
Around 20 cases of West Nile virus infection were reported in Tunisia
in recent weeks, though none of those infected has died. In the
United States, [as of Wed 15 Oct 2003, 149 of the 6957 cases]
reported this year have died. West Nile virus was named after a
district in the east African state of Uganda where it was first
identified in 1937 in a woman suffering from a high fever.

[The majority of human cases of West Nile virus infection in Europe
have been reported from the eastern Mediterranean region. In the
recent past there have been significant outbreaks in Romania,
southern Russia, and Israel, and in southern France in the 1960's.
Recent cases in western Europe (Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden)
are considered to have been the result of infection contracted
abroad. It is presumed that the 2 human cases described in the above
report are the 2 suspected human West Nile virus cases reported by
Agence France Presse on Fri 10 Oct 2003 - see:"West Nile virus,
human, equine - France: susp. 20031011.2559." - Mod.CP]
