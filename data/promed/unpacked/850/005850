LASSA FEVER - SIERRA LEONE (02)
===============================
[see
Lassa fever - Sierra Leone 970307120747]
Date: Fri, March 7, 1997 14:18:00 MST
From: C.J. Peters <cjp0@CIDDVD1.EM.CDC.GOV>
As the recent [today] ProMED-mail posting indicates, there has been an
upsurge of Lassa fever patients arriving in the Kenema General Hopital in
Sierra Leone. This is presumably related to conditions attendant to the
civil unrest, but there are no objective data to identify the actual cause
[of the increase in the number of cases], which is in part related to the
renewed ability to travel and seek therapy. We have been working with the
Government of Sierra Leone, Medical Emergency Relief International, and the
WHO to assess and respond to the problem. We have provided stocks of
intravenous ribavirin (which will soon be depleted), trained people in
barrier nursing, as well as providing other assistance. A few treatment
courses of intravenous ribavirin have been retained at CDC to respond to an
imported US hemorrhagic fever or to laboratory accidents. There are no US
sources for intravenous ribavirin at this time. CDC's long-term project in
Sierra Leone has been moved to Guinea and that station is serving as a
resource to provide Sierra Leone with both trained personnel (two are in
Sierre Leone at this time) and diagnostic testing. In addition, a number of
the former staff members are employed by MERLIN in patient care. The
Government of Sierra Leone has donated a ward and committed additional staff.
Recently, Dr. O. Tomori, an experienced Nigerian Lassa scientist with WHO
made an on-site assessment.
The situation points out three unresolved problems:
1. Intravenous ribavirin is in short supply world-wide and is relatively
expensive. There may be alternative regimens using intravenous loading doses
with oral follow-through but these have not been tested. This drug probably
also has utility in [treatment of] the arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers of South
America, Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever, and possibly Rift Valley fever.
2. Lassa fever is a major problem in west Africa year-in and year-out.
There are no accurate data, but the estimates of the number of infections
range from the tens to the hundreds of thousands annually. The incidence
fluctuates by area and by year but it is always present and, even under the
best of circumstances, is unlikely to be adequately addressed by rodent
control.
Yet, like many other regionally important emerging infections, vaccine
development escapes our economic priorities. The technical basis for a
Lassa vaccine was laid by Dave Auperin, Joe McCormick, and others in SPB
[Special Pathogen Branch, CDC/Atlanta] several years ago. Another arenavirus
disease, Argentine hemorrhagic fever, has been controlled through a vaccine
so this approach is practical and feasible, yet even in the case of AHF there
are no immediate prospects for continuing vaccine production.
3. Social and political unrest prevents long-term economic and health
care development as well as the longitudinal, solidly based research that
leads to effective preventive and therapeutic solutions.

[Given the numerous disease problems around the world, we all are fortunate
to have Dr. Peters and his staff at the CDC keeping watch and actively
intervening when invited and when they have adequate resources. Would that
they might have even more resources. In any event, we are greatly indebted
to C.J. for contributing this information, as well as for providing his
incisive insight. -- Mod CHC]
