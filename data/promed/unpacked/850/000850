A farm in Clay County, in northwestern Minnesota, is now under quarantine for a 21-day period after a young quarter horse foal came down with a highly contagious disease and had to be euthanized.

The Minnesota Board of Animal Health said Monday [29 Jul 2019] that post-mortem tests confirmed equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) had infected the 6-week-old foal. The state has since put its EHM Control Plan into effect in the immediate area.

Six other horses on that farm near Fargo-Moorhead are being monitored, and nearby farms are being urged to step up their biosecurity protocols. North Dakota animal health officials have already reported one case of EHM there earlier in 2019.

"It's spread by direct contact with an infected horse," said Michael Crusan, Communications Director of the Minnesota Board of Animal Health. "It could even be a brush used on an infected animal, then used later at a different location on another horse."

EHM is most commonly spread from horse to horse by nose-to-nose contact, but it can also be spread by feed and water buckets or a person's hands and clothing.

"Horse owners should take this opportunity to review their biosecurity protocols, both on the farm and when traveling, to ensure they are doing their best to protect their horses and Minnesota's equine community from communicable and contagious diseases like EHM," said Dr. Courtney Wheeler, the agency's Equine Program Director.

Crusan said on 15 Jul 2019 that the veterinarian examining the sick foal at the Clay County farm noticed worsening neurologic symptoms: a loosely hanging lower lip, biting at his front legs, stumbling, circling and an inability to rise on his own. All horses exposed to the foal are being monitored.

Crusan said the Board of Animal Health is prevented by law from publicly identifying the farm, other than to report in which county it is located. Clay County stretches just east of Moorhead, including the communities of Barnesville, Dilworth, Glyndon, Hawley and Sabin.

Post-mortem test results of a 6-week-old quarter horse who was euthanized earlier this month [July 2019] in Clay County, Minnesota confirmed that the horse was infected with equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy [EHM], a highly contagious disease which affects horses.

The horse had numerous signs before it died, including a loosely hanging lower lip, biting at his front legs, stumbling, circling, and not being able to rise on his own.

The University of North Dakota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory conducted a necropsy and confirmed the horse suffered from EHM, the 1st confirmed case since 2015.

Horses can appear healthy but still spread the virus.

The farm has been placed under quarantine and the remaining horses will be closely monitored for signs of the virus.

All cases of EHM must be reported to the Board of Animal Health.

[Clay county Minnesota is on the western edge of the state and adjoins North Dakota. However, this case is in Minnesota.

It is unusual to find a 6-week-old foal affected. This foal was too young to vaccinate. While vaccination does not prevent the disease, it may lessen the severity of it.

This disease affects so many horses, yet there remains no specific vaccine for the neurological form.

Protect your horse. Vaccinate your horse. If you must travel or visit others, please take your horse's temperature at least twice a day, and record it on a chart. A slight rise in temperature may be the earliest sign, so seek help. - Mod.TG
