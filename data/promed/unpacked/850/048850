said.
Luterbach was cited as saying the most likely source of infection was the
animal's mother, whom [which had been imported from a part of South Dakota
where another sick elk had come from. There is some evidence chronic
wasting disease can be spread within a herd, but Luterbach added that

relatives has been lifted, but Luterbach said they will be surveyed every
six months to see if any animals show signs of disease.
