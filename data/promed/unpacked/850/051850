A passenger with contagious disease has been isolated during a flight
from Asia to the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), prompting
federal health officials to launch an investigation, authorities said
on Sunday [23 Nov 2008].

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) got involved
soon after it was determined the passenger had some sort of food
poisoning or other stomach problem, city fire officials said.

Some 343 passengers and crew were held aboard the United Airlines jet
for nearly an hour before they were allowed to deplane, officials
said.

Los Angeles City Fire spokesman Cecil Manresa said paramedics were
called to LAX Terminal 7 early Sunday morning [23 Nov 2008] by United
Airlines. By the time the rescue team had arrived, a representative
from CDC was already on the plane's upper deck, where the sick person
had been isolated by airline crew.

Passengers of the United Airlines jumbo jet, inbound from Bangkok and
Tokyo, were held at gate 74 while the CDC representative sought to
determine whether the sick person on board was highly contagious.

[2] Airplane, infectious tuberculosis - Canada ex multicountry

Passengers who may have been exposed to infectious TB [tuberculosis]
on at least 15 long-haul flights into and out of Canada were never
notified because airlines failed to share information with federal
health officials, The Globe and Mail has learned.

A Public Health Agency of Canada [PHAC] report obtained under Access
to Information legislation says the unnamed airlines either refused
or failed to provide manifests and other passenger details on more
than a quarter of the flights it investigated for possible
tuberculosis exposure between 2006 and 2007. Following international
guidelines, PHAC normally identifies passengers who sat in the 5 rows
around an infectious patient. Letters are sent via local public
health authorities to these "contacts" to recommend a follow-up skin
test.

Without passenger information, contacts weren't identified and no
letters sent. The agency opted against other measures, such as going
public with flight details.

The [PHAC] report, which notes a dramatic increase in the number of
such cases in Canada, raises questions about Ottawa's ability to
manage, track, and control the spread of TB and other types of
contagion on airplanes. The agency insists there was little risk to
passengers, that problems with information-sharing no longer exist,
and that airlines have fully co-operated this year [2008] on 40 new
aircraft-related TB cases -- though there is no legal requirement for
them to do so.

The chance of contracting TB on an aircraft is very low. Only
passengers within the immediate vicinity of an infected patient are
at risk, and only after prolonged exposure. But the World Health
Organization (WHO) has urged increased vigilance due to the explosion
of international air travel, the prevalence of the disease in the
developing world and the emergence of drug-resistant strains.

From 1 Jan 2006 to 31 Dec 2007, the PHAC was notified by provincial
health authorities of 53 cases of TB with a history of air travel in
Canada -- a significant increase from the 19 total cases it received
over the previous 4 years. The majority of the cases, 58 percent,
were moderately to highly infectious; 3 cases were drug-resistant,
including 2 cases of multidrug-resistant TB [MDR TB]. Nearly all
infected patients, 94 percent, were foreign-born.

The agency whittled down a list of 105 affected flights to 59 that
required passenger-contact tracing based on WHO guidelines. Those
protocols rule out all but the most serious cases: It must be likely
the patient was infectious at the time of travel, the flight must
have occurred within the past 3 months and it must have lasted longer
than 8 hours. (Canada goes a step further by tracking all cases of
laryngeal and multidrug-resistant TB regardless of flight duration.)
The airlines, which the agency won't name, failed to make available
information on 15 of the 59 identified flights.

"For 5 of these flights, no response was ever received from the
airline despite repeated attempts by TBPC [Tuberculosis Prevention
and Control] staff," the report notes. "In one case, a subpoena was
requested by the airline before they would release any passenger
information. This request was addressed by TBPC but to date no
further response has been received from the airline."

For another 3 flights, the responsible airlines preferred to contact
passengers themselves and refused to hand over manifests, the report
states. On other flights, passenger names couldn't be found or
manifests were missing, including 2 that had been purged from the
airline's computer system.

Even when there was co-operation, there were problems. "For 3
flights, the details provided on the manifest were not sufficient for
contact tracing and further information has been requested and
remains pending," the report notes. No seating information was
provided for one flight, which meant all passengers had to be
contacted. The agency was still waiting for passenger manifests from
2 more flights at the time the report was written on 16 Jan 2008.

Dr Howard Njoo, director-general of the agency's Centre for
Communicable Diseases and Infection Control, stressed there was
little risk of disease transmission on the flights in question.
Although the cases involved active TB, the agency determined they
weren't contagious enough to warrant a public alert, he said. Dr Njoo
said there are other means to track down passengers without
manifests, including customs declaration cards. He said he didn't
know how many people on the 15 flights were traced this way. But when
pressed, the agency later confirmed none was.

"If they don't know where the passenger was seated, then they have to
contact the whole airplane," said Dr Claude Thibeault, a former
medical director for Air Canada and now medical advisor to the
International Air Transport Association (IATA). He serves on the WHO
panel that wrote the guidelines for handling TB cases on aircraft. Dr
Thibeault said some airlines have been reluctant to share information
because of privacy concerns and conflicting domestic and
international regulations. "This issue is being discussed everywhere.
It's not malicious and there's nothing to hide from the airlines'
standpoint, it's purely a legal issue," he said.

Another problem is that carriers aren't typically notified of TB
cases until several weeks or months after the flight, by which time
their computer systems have been purged of much passenger
information, he said. The jury's still out on the value of contact
tracing, he added, noting some countries -- especially those with
limited resources and where TB is endemic -- prefer to focus on
actual cases rather than potential transmission.

Dr Njoo concurs that Canada runs one of the most proactive TB
surveillance programs in the world. "Our criteria for even
identifying a particular flight and trying to get information to
contact fellow passengers at risk within the 5 rows would be
considered cutting-edge compared to many other countries," he said.
He attributes the year-over-year increase in cases to better
co-operation with the provinces.

An-Lac Nguyen, the lawyer representing passengers in the Speaker
lawsuit, said he agrees with PHAC's decision not to go public with
the flights for which it had no passenger information. "The fact is,
TB is not that easily contracted and there's an alarming effect of
making a public announcement," he said.

But Mr Nguyen said he would like to see health authorities make the
public better aware of the risks and to "be more forceful in
forbidding people from flying when there's real danger."

Unlike Canada, the US has maintained a national "Do Not Board" list
since June 2007 that prevents passengers with serious infectious
diseases from boarding commercial aircraft departing from or arriving
within its borders. Names are added by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention upon review of requests made by public health
officials in any jurisdiction. In its 1st year, the CDC received 42
requests, including 3 from Canadian officials. 33 names were added --
all because of infectious pulmonary tuberculosis. Canada handles
flight bans on a local, case-by-case basis and only when it's knows a
patient intends to fly on a particular airline.

According to the WHO, air quality on board commercial aircraft is
high and generally cleaner than the air in most buildings. The risk
of TB transmission increases on long-haul flights, but it's similar
to that of any other instance when people share an enclosed space for
a long period of time, the organization states.

There has yet to be a clinically confirmed case in which a person
developed active TB disease after being infected by a fellow airplane
passenger. However, there are documented cases from the early 1990s
of airline passengers and crews acquiring the infection while on long
flights, including multidrug-resistant TB.

Tuberculosis screening is mandatory for immigrants and refugees to
most countries, including Canada, but it is not required for the vast
majority of airline passengers.

[These 2 news releases illustrate 2 very different responses to a
potentially contagious illness on board an airplane. The 1st news
release concerns the very prompt response to what was apparently a
very acute, dramatic illness in a passenger. The seemingly
coordinated response involved the airplane crew, the airline company,
the airport, the federal government (CDC), and local city fire/rescue
personnel.

In contrast to this prompt response to an acute illness in a
passenger while on board an airplane is the uncoordinated, slow, and
partial response illustrated in the 2nd news release to infectious
tuberculosis in airplane passengers. Infectious tuberculosis, a
chronic illness often without dramatic symptoms that would prompt
alarm among fellow passengers and crew, has the potential to go
unnoticed or prompt a delayed response only after authorities become
aware of the potential transmission on board a flight when the
infected passenger seeks medical care at a later point in time.

WHO issued guidelines in 2006
<http://www.who.int/tb/publications/2006/who_htm_tb_2006_363.pdf>
concerning tuberculosis and air travel. The WHO guidelines for
prevention of airplane exposure to infectious tuberculosis require
cooperation of the patient and their health care providers, the
airlines, and public health authorities and other officials in each
country where there may have been a risk of exposure:

People with infectious tuberculosis must postpone any air travel
until advised by their physicians that they are no longer infectious.
Physicians must promptly inform the relevant health authority when
they are aware of an infectious TB patient's intention to travel or
their actually having traveled against medical advice. Public health
authorities must promptly contact potentially exposed passengers and
crew and advise them to seek medical evaluation. This, of course,
requires maintenance of adequate passenger locator records.

According to the WHO guidelines "health authorities should promptly
contact potentially exposed passengers and crew and advise them to
seek medical evaluation," and since "airlines usually have a system
in place to reach passengers and inform them of flight changes or
cancellations...airline companies should cooperate with health
authorities in providing all contact information needed by them and
facilitate contact tracing of passengers and/or crew."

Transmission of tuberculosis aboard an airplane depends on the
ability of a patient to generate an infectious aerosol, the adequacy
of airplane ventilation, the duration of air travel, and the
proximity of passengers and crew to the index case.

The WHO guidelines recommend that passengers on flights 8 or more
hours in duration who are seated in the same row and the 2 rows ahead
and behind the index patient, as well as cabin crew members working
in the same cabin section should be contacted for determination if
transmission of tuberculosis has occurred by means of medical
assessment, tuberculin skin testing (TST), or interferon-gamma
release assays, chest radiography; contact should be maintained for
at least 3 years.

The process used to assess tuberculosis infection following exposure
is complex
<http://www.who.int/tb/publications/2006/who_htm_tb_2006_363.pdf>.
Because usually it takes 2 to 8 weeks after the onset of tuberculosis
infection for the immune system to react to tuberculin, to identify
those who have been infected by their recent airplane exposure, but
tested negative during the initial screening, a repeat TST is
required 8 to 12 weeks post-exposure.

A discussion of aircraft ventilation and the assessment required of
exposed passengers and crew for acquisition of tuberculosis can be
found in this moderator's comments found in ProMED-mail posting
