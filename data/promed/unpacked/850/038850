[According to WAHID's event summary, 10 outbreaks have been recorded
in Bulgaria so far in domestic animals, following the initial case
identified in a wild boar, totalling 11 outbreaks; see map with the 11
foci, all along the border between Bulgaria's Burgas and Turkey's
Kirklareli provinces, at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10138.

In contrast to the previous outbreaks, which were suspected upon
clinical signs, the current 2 adjacent outbreaks (Nos. 9 and 10 in
domestic animals) have been identified by serology only. As Bulgaria
clarified to the EU, the 2 outbreaks involved "backyard holdings in
Bliznak village and on a holding located 2 km apart in Malko Tarnovo
municipality, Burgas region." See Mon 4 Apr 2011, 17:24, at
http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/docs/chronlogy_bg_2011-07012011.pdf.

According to Bulgaria's presentation to EU's SCFCAH [Standing
Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health] of 4 Apr 2011, the
above 72 buffaloes "were grazed at about 3-5 km far from the Turkish
border;" see
http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/04042011_fmd_bulgaria.pdf.

The presentation includes the following "Epidemiological
considerations:"

"1. So far, the source of the 2nd wave FMD outbreaks in March - April
[2011] remains unclear; one of the hypotheses is that the virus could
have entered through infected wild boar again from Thrace;
2. All outbreaks are located nearby or within forests (possible
contact between domestic livestock and wildlife);
3. Analysis of isolates from the Kirovo outbreak (4) made in the EU
Reference Laboratory for FMD in Pirbright show that there is no link
between the current outbreak in March [2011] and the previous
outbreaks in January 2011."

The expressed suspicions on the possible involvement of wildlife in
the continuous circulation of the virus are in need of laboratory
confirmation. According to the above presentation, so far, 17 wild
boars (_Sus scrofa_) and 6 roe deer (_Capreolus capreolus_) have been
virologically and serologically tested, all with negative results.
Wildlife sampling deserves to be intensified. In addition, tests
within Turkey's neighbouring territory are needed and are anticipated
with great interest.

The above 2 sources have been kindly forwarded by Sabine Zentis, who
is gratefully acknowledged.

Notably, EU's research project "FMD-DISCONVAC" [Development,
enhancement and complementation of animal-sparing, foot and-mouth
disease vaccine-based control strategies for free and endemic
regions], which started 1 Apr 2009 for the duration of 39 months,
includes, within its "Workpackage 6," titled "Improving knowledge on
FMDV transmission between species and in recently vaccinated animals,"
objective 5: "To study the role of gazelles and wild boars in FMDV
transmission under natural filed [sic] conditions." Workpackage 6 is
led by CVI (The Central Veterinary Institute, Netherlands). The other
participants are IIL (Indian Immunologicals Limited) and KVI (Kimron
Veterinary Institute, Israel). Further details at
