Turkey bans import of Austrian cattle on bluetongue suspicion
-------------------------------------------------------------
Turkey introduced an import ban on Austrian cattle last week after
bluetongue [BT], a viral disease that infects cows and sheep, was
detected in a sample from a selection of [imported] Austrian cows.

A Turkish laboratory said at least one test on cows imported from
Austria was positive, according to a spokesman for Austria's Ministry
of Health, who declined to be identified in line with ministry
policy. Austria sent a delegation to Turkey last week to take
samples, all of which tested negative and a laboratory in the UK is
currently cross-checking the samples, he said.

The tests were carried out after 5 Austrian cows died in Turkey and
15 cows that were in calf suffered stillbirths, Austria's Profil
magazine reported today [20 Feb 2011] without saying where it
obtained the information.

Austria hasn't had a case of bluetongue since 2008 and has carried
out 132 000 tests since then, all of which were negative, the
spokesman said. Bluetongue causes mouth ulcers in animals and in some
cases turns their tongues blue and can be fatal. The illness is
transmitted by [midge] bites. It poses no danger to humans.

Bluetongue disease: cattle tested positive
------------------------------------------
According to "Profil", a Turkish Lab found bluetongue-positive cattle
among tested animals imported from Lower Austria. Turkey has
temporarily banned the imports of cattle from Austria.

An Austrian delegation has travelled to Turkey to visit the
laboratory and obtain samples from animals still alive. These have,
however, tested negative, they say.

Franz Karner, a state veterinarian from Lower Austria, says that, in
view of the monitoring measures operational in Austria, he is
confident that the possibility that the animals were infected prior
to their arrival in Turkey can be excluded.

The Austrian Ministry of Health confirmed that all 132 000 domestic
animals tested locally had been negative. According to Kramer, a full
protective coverage was rendered to Austria's cattle population since
2008 by the nationwide vaccination scheme. He suspects a diagnosis
problem in the Turkish laboratory, or that infection occurred during
the transportation of the animals within Turkey.

[The information, included in the 2 media reports above, can be
summarized as follows:
1. 5 Austrian cows, imported to Turkey (when?!), reportedly died in
Turkey and 15 other pregnant imported cows suffered stillbirths.
2. At least one imported cow (of the affected cows above?!) was found
positive to bluetongue infection (which serotype? which test?) by a
Turkish laboratory.
3. Based upon the above, Turkey has discontinued imports of cattle
from Austria.
4. According to Austria's statements, no BT cases have been reported
there since the end 2008 (and see further); while general vaccination
and wide scale serosurveillance are applied.

Austria's 2 solitary "outbreaks" of BTV-8 in cattle were reported in
October and November 2008; see Austria's report on bluetongue, dated
23 Jan 2009, at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/bt_34022009_at.pdf>.

On top of the discussion on the validity of the BT diagnosis in this
case, it would be useful to note which clinical and/or laboratory
investigations have been carried out on the dead and clinically
affected (stillbirths) imported cattle. Various abortifacient and
other disease agents are known to be endemic in Turkey, including
_Brucella abortus_ and _Brucella melitensis_, which have been shown
to infect unvaccinated, imported breeding cattle in the past. Cattle
diseases which are widespread and which have been reported during
2010 are FMD, bovine tuberculosis, anthrax, and bluetongue (serotype
16, in Antalya).

Results of ongoing investigations and lab tests in Turkey, Austria,
or Pirbright will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
