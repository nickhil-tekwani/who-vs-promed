Regarding Yellow fever - Angola (Uige, Huila)(02): susp. [ProMED
20061224.3597], the cluster of patients with gastrointestinal
bleeding in Angola is suggestive of anthrax, given the high
case-fatality rate and frequency of intestinal perforation. Outbreaks
associated with ingestion of contaminated beef or goat meat are not
uncommon in sub-Saharan Africa.

[From the very brief description given in the original posting,
20061221.3580, and the 50 percent case fatality rate, it might well
be gastrointestinal anthrax. As the more common cutaneous cases --
normally seen in such events from the initial butchering of affected
animals -- are absent from the reports, one might hypothesize that
these cases in both areas at opposite ends of the country came from
meat sold in town street markets. And if the Reuters report was based
on ministerial briefings in Luanda, everyone is comfortably distant
from the action. Anthrax is not uncommon in Angola, though they tend
to forget to report cases in small ruminants, which have an historic
relationship with human deaths in Angola.
