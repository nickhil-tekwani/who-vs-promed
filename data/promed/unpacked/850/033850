From 2009 to date [27 Jun 2014], 72 people in Mexicali [Baja California state, Mexico] have died due to rickettsial disease; 11 of these in the 1st 6 months of 2014, according to data provided by the Department of Epidemiology at the Secretariat of Health.

In 2009, 9 people were killed. By 2010 the figure reached nearly 12 deaths; there were 8 in 2011, 15 in 2012, and up to 15 Nov 2013 there were 17 deaths, which, added to the registered in 2014, reach 72 people who were killed by the disease spread by a tick bite.

The above numbers were provided by the director of Health Services, Rigoberto Isarraras Hernandez, in a meeting on 11 Jun 2014. The alderman said that in the municipality the cases of rickettsiosis are increasing, so the authorities are collaborating on cleaning vacant lots to eliminate places ticks abound.

Monreal Gastelum recalled that the problem is not unique to the area known as Los Santorales, but that it is all over the city, especially where people have dogs as pets.

In Mexicali, Baja California, 2 girls died due to a rickettsial bacterium that is transmitted by ticks. Ticks can be on some pets, so the health authorities noted that the hygiene and care of animals goes hand in hand with the prevention of rickettsia. The victims of the ticks were 2 girls of 9 and 10 years of age.

It should be noted that in 2014, there have been 11 deaths from rickettsia in the country.

[The 2 parts of the posting differ regarding whether the 11 deaths were in Mexicali or the country as a whole.

The species of rickettsia here is not specifically mentioned, but _Rickettsia rickettsii_ is known to be endemic in parts of Mexico.

_R. rickettsii_, the cause of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, has been identified in southern Canada, the USA, northern Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, Brazil, and Argentina (1-6). Some synonyms for Rocky Mountain spotted fever in other countries include tick typhus, Tobia fever (Colombia), Sao Paulo fever and febre maculosa (Brazil), and fiebre manchada (Mexico).
