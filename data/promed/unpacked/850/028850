Flood-related disease kills 381 in eastern India
The flood-ravaged Indian state of West Bengal is now suffering a
gastroenteritis epidemic that has killed 381, the Press Trust of India
reported Tuesday.
Nearly 42,000 people, the vast majority of them women and children, have
been affected by the outbreak, which followed intense flooding in the
district of Malda.
Most victims contracted gastroenteritis after drinking polluted flood
water. Much of Malda was submerged throughout July following heavy rains.
