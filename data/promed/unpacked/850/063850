A mother and daughter, who recently died in mysterious circumstances
in Lagos, have been suspected to have died of the deadly bird flu
disease, thus, giving rise to speculations of a possible
human-to-human infection of the disease in the country.
The 2 were said to have died within 2 weeks after they allegedly ate
a chicken the mother bought for the family during the Christmas and
New Year celebrations at a popular chicken market along Ikorodu Road,
Lagos. While the mother died on 4 Jan 2007, the daughter also lost
her life on 17 Jan 2007.
According to information, after the daughter's death, the father was
said to have ordered an autopsy of the girl as well as his dead wife.
The result of the autopsy suspected bird flu disease as the cause of
their deaths, and it was after this that the father also disclosed
that one of the chickens they had bought during the festive season
had died mysteriously and they had to quickly slaughter the rest.
THISDAY [News Agency] gathered that the family has since been
quarantined while further investigations are being carried out by
officials of the World Health Organisation (WHO). WHO spokesman, Mr.
Austine Ogbide, in a telephone chat with THISDAY, confirmed that WHO
is "aware of the case of a woman and her daughter who allegedly died
after consuming a chicken," but was quick to warn that the "cause of
their deaths was yet to be determined." He also said the chicken is
still being diagnosed and that it [would] not be proper to conclude
that the mother and daughter died as a result of [consuming] the chicken.
He added that WHO is still waiting for the outcome of the
investigations after which it would make a definitive statement.
UNICEF record shows that over 300 people world over have been
reported to have contracted the disease, and out of the figure, about
68 people have been reported to have died [In fact, as of 22 Jan 2007
the WHO Cumulative Table of confirmed human cases of H5N1 avian
influenza lists 269 cases (including 163 deaths) in 10 countries. - Mod.CP]
If the ongoing investigation confirms that both mother and daughter
died as a result of the disease, it would be the 1st case of
human-to-human transmission of the virus in the country.

[According to WHO data the incubation period is in the range 2-8
days, and occasionally has been as long as 17 days; 7 days is taken
as the mean value for epidemiological surveillance. The period of
illness is in the range 4 -13 days, and depending on virus
strain/host population, from rapid in Indonesia to asymptomatic in
South Korea. But the evidence for considering these cases to be a
result of avian influenza virus infection seems to be no more than
circumstantial at present, with a hint of opportunism. Confirmation
by laboratory testing is awaited. - Mod.CP]
