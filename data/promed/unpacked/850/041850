The Republic of Ireland has become the third country to report a case of
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD). St Vincent's Hospital in Dublin
reported that a patient who had undergone a gastroscopy earlier this year
was diagnosed with nvCJD on May 31, 1999. The scope used on the
nvCJD-infected patient was subsequently used on 49 patients who are being
contacted to alleviate any concerns they may have over possible infection.
Although the patient was not identified by the hospital, it is understood
she is a mother in her 30s who had been resident in England during the
high-risk bovine spongiform encephalopathy period. CJD has been shown to be
transmitted from one infected patient to another via certain neurosurgical
procedures. There is no evidence of nvCJD being passed through instruments
used in non-brain procedures.
