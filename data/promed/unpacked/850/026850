INFECTIOUS DISEASE SOFTWARE (GIDEON) AVAILABLE
***********************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Dr. Steve Berger <mberger@post.tau.ac.il>

ProMED-mail subscribers will have seen frequent reference to the GIDEON
software in posts discussing alternative diagnoses for diseases of unknown
etiology, or background data on previous occurrence. GIDEON contains an
encyclopedic database on infectious diseases, their distribution, diagnosis
and treatment (see details below).
GIDEON's developers are making a generous offer of this software to
ProMED-mail subscribers at a heavily discounted price, which will also
benefit ProMED-mail's operations in two ways: 20 copies will be donated to
HealthNet nodes in developing countries such as the Vanga Hospital in
Dem.Rep.Congo (former Zaire) and the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Gabon --
both in the Ebola belt of Africa -- and the other Albert Schweitzer
Hospital in Haiti; and a donation to ProMED-mail will be made in proportion
to the number of copies sold.
The following review of GIDEON is abstracted from JAMA, 277:1085, (April 2)
1997:
"Anyone who has never used a good artificial intelligence program would do
well to start at the top with GIDEON. Global Infectious Diseases and
Epidemiology Network is a superb example of artificial intelligence applied
to medicine. Given modern air transportation, the most ordinary of
patients now can be recently returned from the most extraordinary of
places, exposed to infectious disease one has not even heard of, much less
is knowledgeable about.
"What infectious diseases are relevant to a fly fisherman returning febrile
from the Chilean Andes or to a Coca Cola salesman returning with a
nonhealing skin ulcer from Siberia? Problems once in the domain only of
university specialists now are seen in the offices of medical practitioners
throughout the country.
"GIDEON is designed to diagnose all the world's infectious diseases (over
300) from over 200 countries, based on the symptoms, signs, and laboratory
findings that you enter for your patient. That is the essence of what it
does, with remarkable ease of use, obscuring the fact that such diagnosis
is a frighteningly complex task, involving data on conditions totally
unfamiliar to most physicians outside the involved countries. The program
screens are successfully intuitive for straightforward clinical
application, and the accompanying manual is quite clearly written.
"Beyond this basic function is an extraordinary array of secondary
information.
"The Epidemiology Module provides clinical information about each of the
world's infectious diseases, the distribution of those diseases, and vector
and reservoir information for them.
"The Therapy Module provides detailed information about choices in drug
therapy, including susceptibility, toxicity, and drug interaction data, not
only on familiar antimicrobials, but on ones rarely used. A list with
synonyms is included of all commercially available antimicrobials
worldwide. Vaccine and immune globulin
information is similarly available.
"For purposes of identification, the Microbiology Module provides full
laboratory characteristics, including biochemical test results and cultural
characteristics, for almost 900 organisms.
"Put plainly, GIDEON is an intellectual tour de force that operates in
the simplest of fashions.
"GIDEON is a fine product. Further information [and a demonstration] is
available at the Website:
<http://www.cyinfo.com>
The text of the GIDEON website is as lucid as the text of the program itself."
