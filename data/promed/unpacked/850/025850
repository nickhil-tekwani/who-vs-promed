Nova Scotia: Probable Human Case of West Nile Virus Infection - Travel-related
--------------------------------------------------
Health officials announced on Fri 21 Aug 2003 that a man from the Capital
Health District is the province's first probable human case of West Nile
virus infection. It is believed that he became infected during recent
travel to an area of the United States where there are human cases.
"Preliminary test results were positive, but final test results to confirm
West Nile virus won't be available for a few weeks," said Dr. Maureen
Baikie, Associate Medical Officer of Health for the province. "The
individual went to outpatients with neurological symptoms, has been treated
on an outpatient basis, and is doing very well."
Dr. Baikie said that this case poses no health risk to Nova Scotians. West
Nile virus cannot be transmitted from person to person, other than through
the blood system. The individual is not a recent blood donor, and Canadian
Blood Services has safeguards in place to protect the blood system.
"This probable case shows that our human surveillance system is working,"
said Dr. Baikie. "We have seen no West Nile virus activity in the province
despite extensive testing. That fact, combined with the person's recent
travel history to an area with West Nile virus activity, makes us confident
that the disease was acquired outside of the province."
West Nile virus is spread to people through bites from mosquitoes that
carry the virus. Nova Scotia travellers should check on West Nile virus
activity in areas that they are travelling through or to. In areas where
there are positive birds, mosquito pools, or human cases, people should
reduce the risk of mosquito bites by wearing loose-fitting clothing that
covers as much skin as possible, and using insect repellant containing DEET
according to the instructions on the bottle.
Physicians across the province have been informed of the symptoms of West
Nile virus and are required to report any suspected cases of human
infection. Anyone who demonstrates the more severe symptoms of the disease
-- which include a severe headache, high fever, stiff neck, muscle
weakness, and neurological symptoms -- should seek medical attention.
The public is urged to continue reporting dead crows, blue jays, and ravens
to local offices of the Department of Natural Resources. Staff can then
determine whether the bird is suitable for West Nile virus testing. More
than 600 birds have been tested for the virus so far this season.

Department of Health Web site: .

Nova Scotia: West Nile Virus Infection Probably Contracted in Colorado
--------------------------------------------------
Health officials in Nova Scotia reported the province's first probable
human case of the West Nile virus on Thu 20 Aug 2003 after a man returned
home from the southern United States suffering from an array of suspicious
symptoms. The man is believed to be 54 years old and from the Halifax area.
Dr. Maureen Baikie, Associate Medical Officer of Health, said the man
likely contracted the virus in Colorado, where he had been camping and
where there are confirmed cases of the virus in humans. She said the
incubation period of 3-14 days also made it more likely that he had been
exposed in the States.
The province has tested more than 600 birds for the virus, but has had no
positive results. It reported 4 positive findings in birds in 2002.
Confirmed or probable human cases of the virus have been found in all 3
Prairie provinces [Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan] as well as in
Ontario. Colorado has been the hardest-hit of the US states, with nearly
400 cases and 7 deaths attributed to West Nile, according to state public
health numbers. In 2002, there were 416 probable or confirmed cases of
human West Nile in Canada and 21 deaths attributed to the virus. All deaths
occurred in Ontario and Quebec.
