Pests threaten rice fields across the country
---------------------------------------------
More than 10 600 ha (26 193 acres) of rice in the Cuu Long (Mekong)
Delta have been affected by ragged stunt rice disease and yellow
stunt rice disease, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Development.

The diseases have also spread to 6200 ha (15 321 acres) of rice in
the southeastern provinces of Tay Ninh and Binh Duong. Southern
provinces have destroyed more than 600 ha (1483 acres) of infected rice.

Northern provinces in the Hong (Red) Delta, including Bac Giang, Bac
Ninh, and Nam Dinh, have 13 600 ha (33 606 acres) of rice affected by
rice leaf blight. The northern provinces plant protection departments
have told farmers to spray chemicals on affected rice fields.

[_Rice ragged stunt virus_ (RRSV; genus _Oryzavirus_) is know from a
number of countries in Asia. Symptoms include ragged appearance of
plants, twisted leaves, vein swelling, and severe stunting. Its only
way of spread is vector transmission by brown planthoppers
(_Nilaparvata lugens_). Besides rice (_Oryza sativa_), the related
species _O. latifolia_ and _O. nivara_ can also be affected.

_N. lugens_ is one of the worst pests of rice in the Australasian and
Pacific Island region. In addition to being a virus vector, it causes
yellowing, browning, and drying of plants ('hopper burn') and leaves
small injuries exposing the plant to fungal and bacterial infections
(for example leaf blight as reported here). _Rice grassy stunt virus_
(RGSV; genus _Tenuivirus_) is transmitted by the same vector and
therefore it often occurs together with RRSV. However, RGSV has not
been mentioned in the report above.

Rice yellow stunt virus_ (RYSV; genus _Nucleorhabdovirus_; synonym
_Rice transitory yellowing virus_) affects only rice causing leaf
yellowing, reduced tillering, and mild stunting. Plants may recover
temporarily and appear healthy, but symptoms may reappear. RYSV is
transmitted by green rice leafhoppers (_Nephotettix_ species). The
incidence of RYSV is generally low in the 1st crop and high in the
2nd. After the harvest of late-planted rice, RTYV overwinters in rice
stubble or in the vector.

In tropical regions, levels of rice virus infection and vector
density may be very high. Crop losses of up to 100 percent due to
some virus diseases have been reported. Disease management for rice
viruses includes cultural practices, vector control, and use of
cultivars with reduced sensitivity or resistance to the virus, the
vector, or both.

Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas oryzae_
pv. _oryzae_. The pathogen causes yellowing and drying of leaves and
wilting of seedlings. Yield losses of up to 60 percent have been
reported in Asia. The bacterium is short-lived in soil and suspected
to be seed-borne, and it is spread mainly by windblown rain and
mechanical means. Disease management includes phytosanitation,
cultural measures, and use of resistant crop varieties. For more
information on BLB, please see previous ProMED-mail posts and links below.
