Western Australians [WA] who have recently been to Bali [Indonesia] or are planning a trip to the island are being warned of a potential risk of legionnaires' disease at Ramayana Resort and Spa in central Kuta. It comes after the 4th notified case in WA since February [2019].

WA Health Department director of communicable disease control Paul Armstrong said the hotel was linked to earlier outbreaks in 2010 and 2011, which affected at least 13 Australians.

Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia, most often affecting older people who smoke or have lung disease, diabetes, kidney disease, or a weakened immune system.

A cluster of cases from Perth, Western Australia (WA), has been identified as having _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 (laboratory confirmed), with all 4 cases having holidayed in Bali, Indonesia, and stayed at the same hotel in Central Kuta, during their incubation period -- the Ramayana Resort and Spa, located on Jalan Singosari. A media statement can be found at https://ww2.health.wa.gov.au/Media-releases/2019/Legionnaires-disease-warning-for-Bali-travellers.

Onset dates for the 4 WA cases were [4 Feb to 30 Nov 2019], after their return to Australia. All 4 cases became unwell with severe pneumonia requiring hospitalisation. It seems most probable that they were infected in Bali, most likely at their hotel. Information provided by the cases and those with whom they travelled has not identified places that all frequented other than the hotel and airports. An additional 2 cases of legionnaires' disease have been identified from elsewhere in Australia in 2019, both of whom travelled to Bali independently of each other; one stayed at the same hotel as the WA cases and the other at the hotel adjacent to it.

The same hotel was implicated in a previous international outbreak of legionnaires' disease between August 2010 and November 2011, which affected a total of 13 Australians, including 9 people from WA.

Please consider the diagnosis of legionellosis in people with consistent illness recently returned from Bali.

[ProMED-mail previously posted several news reports in 2010 and 2011 of an outbreak of legionnaires' disease due to _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 that involved 10 Australians (6 from Western Australia and 4 from Victoria) who visited Bali, 9 of whom stayed at the Ramayana Hotel in Central Kuta (Legionellosis - Australia (03): ex Indonesia (Bali) alert 20110610.1759
Legionellosis - Australia (02): ex Indonesia (Bali) alert 20110119.0226
Legionellosis - Australia: (WA,VI) ex Indonesia (Bali) 20110115.0173
Legionellosis - Australia: (WA) ex Indonesia (Bali) alert 20100826.3021). There were said to be at least 2 additional cases in Europeans linked to Bali in the same time-frame, one of whom stayed in this hotel.

The current post above reports 4 cases of legionnaires' disease in Western Australians who stayed at the same hotel (Ramayana Resort and Spa) in 2019 in Central Kuta.

_Legionella_ are Gram-negative bacilli that are found in both natural freshwater environments, like lakes and streams, and in manufactured plumbing systems, such as showerheads and sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, and hot tubs/spas and hot water tanks and heaters. Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/). _L pneumophila_ have been shown to persist for long periods after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems usually done by culture would miss VBNC [viable but nonculturable] _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249). The persistence of _Legionella_ over many years in the water system at the Kuta facility could perhaps be due to VBNC organisms.

According to the US CDC, about 20-25% of all legionnaires' disease reported to CDC is travel-associated (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5648a2.htm and http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/conveyance-transportation-issues/cruise-ship-travel). Travelers typically disperse to their homes widely separated from one another and perhaps at a very great distance from the source of infection before developing symptoms, so that a cluster of cases of legionnaires' disease in travelers associated with the same source may not be readily appreciated. A travel history is essential and should be actively sought from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and _Legionella_ testing should be performed for those diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia who have traveled in the 2 weeks before onset of symptoms.

Genotyping the clinical isolates from the 4 cases of legionnaires' disease will help confirm if this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease in these patients was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay for _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping.

Kuta, the capital of Kuta District, in Badung Regency, southern Bali, Indonesia is a tourist beach resort, with many restaurants and bars, located near Bali's Ngurah Rai Airport (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuta). A map of the island of Bali can be accessed at https://capturetheatlas.com/bali-map/.
