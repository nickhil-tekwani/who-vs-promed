In Trans-Nzoia County, 4 people have been quarantined over a suspected outbreak of the highly infectious and deadly hemorrhagic fever similar to Ebola [Marburg virus disease].

Reports indicate that the suspected patients are from neighbouring Uganda and arrived in Bwayi area of Kwanza Constituency on Sun 29 Oct [2017], seeking treatment for "a strange disease" from a local herbalist.

The World Health Organisation (WHO), which has issued an alert on the outbreak of the disease in Uganda, describes it as: "Marburg virus disease (MVD), formerly known as Marburg hemorrhagic fever, a severe, often fatal illness in humans."

The disease has Ebola-like symptoms.

County Director of Health Norbert Musundi says that an emergency committee has been formed to investigate the situation, adding that blood samples from the patients have been sent to KEMRI for screening.

"We got information about people from Uganda who visited the herbalist on Sun 29 Oct [2017] night seeking treatment for an unknown disease. Our officers are keenly monitoring her and the people who visited," said Musundi.

The herbalist and her husband have been put under incubation [quarantine?] for 21 days, to make sure she was free of the virus.

"We are working with Kenya Revenue Authority officers, immigration officials in Uganda and our provincial administrators to ensure that we screen those coming in from entry points. We know traders from Uganda come to Kitale to buy goods," he said.

However, the herbalist denied ever attending to the particular patients before.

In the Kween District of Uganda, 2 people have so far been reported dead of the disease.

[It will be interesting to learn what the laboratory results are for the 4 quarantined individuals who are suspected Marburg virus disease cases who came from Uganda as those results become available. Prevention of movement of individuals who might be incubating an infection at border crossings is difficult. The Kenya health authorities are wise to have imposed a quarantine on the 4 Ugandans and surveillance of the herbalist and her husband to be sure that none are infected with Marburg virus, or, if any are, to provide treatment under conditions of isolation.
