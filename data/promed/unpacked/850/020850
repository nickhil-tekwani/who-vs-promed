As many as 50 pregnant women have been reported unwell at Kamla Raja Hospital in Gwalior [Madhya Pradesh] after being administered with antibiotic injections. The incident, which happened late on [Sun 29 Oct 2017], has left 2 patients extremely critical. 5 such patients were also shifted to the ICU after their condition deteriorated.

At around 9 pm on Sunday, the pregnant patients of 2 wards in Gynaecology Department were given ampicillin injections. Very soon, the women started complaining of shivering and their families reported the matter to the duty staff, which immediately brought it to the notice of the senior doctors. Police and security guards were called in by the hospital staff to avoid any untoward incident and protests from the families of the patients. Soon, assistant superintendent Dr Rita Mishra, HoD [Head of Department] Dr Yashodhara Gaur, and others reached the spot. The physicians had a tough time persuading the families to let them continue with the treatment.

5 of these patients were soon shifted to the ICU after their condition deteriorated drastically. Speaking to CNN-News18, Dr Sanjay Chandel, acting superintendent of the hospital, claimed that women patients complained of feeling cold after being given ampicillin injections, which had been kept as samples for inquiry. "5 women were shifted to ICU. 3 of them are stable, but the condition of the other 2 is serious," Dr Chandel said.

Dr Rita Mishra said it was difficult to immediately ascertain what led to the reaction -- the injection or distilled water. As a precautionary measure, the staff has been asked not to administer ampicillin injections for the time being, she added.

[Ampicillin is a penicillin-like antibiotic that can be used orally, intramuscularly or intravenously to treat bacterial infections; ampicillin is also used to prevent infections, such as group B streptococcal infection in mothers and newborns (given during labor, 2 g of ampicillin intravenously initially, then 1 g intravenously every 4 hours until delivery, which may be why the drug was being administered to some of these pregnant women (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5111a1.htm).

The incident described above involves as many as 50 pregnant hospitalized women who received ampicillin injections. Soon thereafter the women developed a shivering reaction, severe enough to require ICU admissions for 5 patients; the condition of 3 of the 5 ICU admissions is stable, but the condition of the other 2 is critical. It is not stated whether the injections were IV or IM, or if the patients were febrile or developed shock, or the time-line of this event -- that is, if all the pregnant patients were given ampicillin at the same time, if they were all given the same lot of ampicillin, if others were given ampicillin, but were unaffected, and for what reason they were given ampicillin. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

A febrile reaction to ampicillin itself could occur due to allergy, but 50 patients having a febrile allergic reaction within a short time of each other is unlikely. More likely the patients are reacting to a contaminant in the antibiotic solution itself or contamination of some ancillary fluid used to administered the antibiotic.

Endotoxin, also known as bacterial pyrogen (fever-inducing agent), is one of the most potent bacterial toxins. The only source of endotoxin is gram-negative bacteria, where it comprises about 75 percent of the bacterial cell wall. In minute quantities endotoxin can cause shaking chills, followed by fever, tachycardia, respiratory distress, and hypotension; larger amounts can lead to irreversible shock and death. The release of endotoxin from Gram-negative bacteria can take place after death and lysis of the bacterial cell. So cultures may be negative for the Gram-negative organism. In addition, a pyrogenic reaction can also be produced by some Gram-positive bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and viruses.

ProMED-mail has posted previously on outbreaks due to Gram-negative bacterial contaminated IV preparations. _Enterobacter_ species was the cause of the massive multi-institutional outbreak of sepsis related to contaminated IV fluids in the late 1970's (1) and was the cause of an outbreak in neonates due to contaminated IV fluids (2).
