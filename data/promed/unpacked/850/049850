Health authorities asked Hondurans yesterday to eliminate the breeding
sites of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, which transmit dengue. The urgent
request followed reports of 8,100 cases of classic dengue and eight of the
hemorrhagic type - one of whom died - during the first seven months of this
year.
The Minister of Health said the number of cases for the January-July period
is more than four times the number recorded in the same period in 1997.

Authorities asserted that unless the sites where the mosquito breeds are
eliminated the number of cases for 1998 could be as many as 50,000-120,000.
