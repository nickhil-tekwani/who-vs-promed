Anthrax outbreak hits Victoria
-------------------------
A Victorian beef property has been quarantined after anthrax killed
a 17-month-old Hereford heifer.
The Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DNRE)
quarantined the property 50 km northwest of Swan Hill in
northwestern Victoria after pathology samples confirmed diagnosis
of the disease.
DNRE manager Animal Health Operations Dr John Galvin said
immediate measures had been taken to ensure there were no
implications for public health, food safety or trade. The infected
carcass was incinerated and remaining cattle on the property have
been vaccinated. Dr Galvin said investigations into why anthrax was
confirmed in an area where it had previously been unreported were
continuing.
The property will remain quarantined for 42 days with no animals
leaving it during this time.
The anthrax case is the third confirmed in Victoria since June 1998.

[Australia is entering the summer months when drought and dry
weather are more common. Resistance to the disease tends to
decrease in hot weather. Hot weather may mean forage is less
available, or forage that is available may be more dry and brittle,
potentially causing lesions in the consuming animal's pharynx.
Consequently, herd vaccination may be appropriate if more cases
are expected.- Mod.TG]
