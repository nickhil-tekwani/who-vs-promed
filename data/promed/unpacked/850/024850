Egypt on the Watch for Possible Cholera Spread
--------------------------------------------
Xinhua 15 Dec 1998: The Egyptian Ministry of Health is taking
precautionary measures against possible cholera spread in the country
via travelers from Iraq, an official said Tuesday.
Egyptian First Health Undersecretary Said Aun said the World Health
Organization (WHO) has reported that cholera was spreading in
northern Iraq, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Tuesday.
Egypt has therefore decided to take precautions on travelers from
Iraq at its entry points, Aun said, adding that they will be examined
and given four anti-biotic capsules.
WHO has demanded to beef up checkup for the people coming from Iraq
via Damascus, Syria or Amman, Jordan after the outbreak of cholera in
northern Iraq, the news agency said.
An official at Cairo international airport said the doctors in the
airport quarantine submit the passengers from Damascus and Amman to
medical examinations and dispose of all their food.
