Spain: 1st European nationwide IgG seroprevalence study, published 13 May 2020.
Participants 60 983
Seropositive 4.7%-5.4%
IFR [infection fatality rate] 1%-1.2%

Two immunochromatography assays were used with a reported 73%-79% sensitivity and 100% specificity. 97.3% degree of agreement between immunochromatography and immunoassay of 16 953 samples analysed.

Immunoassay results will follow soon.

Official preliminary results and summary of study design
Executive summary
-----------------
ENE-Covid19 study: 1st round. National study on the seroepidemiology of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in Spain

ENE-Covid19 is a large population-based seroepidemiological longitudinal study, the objectives of which are to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection by determining antibodies against the virus in Spain and evaluating its temporal evolution.

The results presented today for the 1st round refer to the reading of the IgG band of the rapid test, since we only have partial results of the analysis by immunoassay.

In the 1st round of ENE-Covid19 ([27 Apr 2020 to 11 May 2020]), 60 983 participants in the national sample and 3234 in the island-population (Canary and Balearic Islands) study (which is not included in this report), were recruited. The participation rate among eligible individuals has been 62.3%, and considering only the people who were able to be contacted, it goes up to 74.7%.

The estimated prevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Spain is 5.0% (95% CI [confidence interval]: 4.7%-5.4%). It is similar in men: 5.0% (95% CI: 4.6%-5.4%) as in women: 5.1% (95% CI: 4.7-5.5%). In relation to age, the prevalence is lower in babies, children, and young people, and quite stable in older age groups.

Regarding the diagnosis or COVID-19 by means of PCR, 87% of the participants who report having had a positive PCR presented with IgG antibodies. In possible suspected cases, the prevalence increases with the number of symptoms and is particularly high in people who report anosmia (43%). Finally, 2.5% of the participants who did not report any symptoms presented IgG antibodies.

Although the national prevalence is at the expected 5%, there is marked geographic variability in the prevalence of antibodies. Analyzing the Autonomous Communities and autonomous cities as a whole: while Ceuta, Murcia, Melilla, Asturias, and the Canary Islands have prevalences of less than 2%, the Communities of Castile-La Mancha and Madrid exceed 10%. In the provincial maps, the central group of provinces with prevalences equal to or close to 10% in the area around Madrid stands out.

The map of possible suspicious cases of COVID-19 (people with 3 or more symptoms or with sudden loss of smell) also shows this central aggregation, with prevalences close to 20%, although equally high values are also observed in some other provinces. Taking into account the possible suspected cases of COVID-19 with the definition used in this study, we observed a reduction in its prevalence between the 1st and 2nd week. The proportion of positives is higher in residents of large cities (greater than 100 000 inhabitants) 6.4% (95% CI: 5.8-7.1).

These results must be considered provisional since they do not have the information that will provide the determination of IgG anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies measured by immunoassay. Furthermore, in successive waves, it will be possible to know the evolution of the prevalence and the changes observed over time in the participants of this large dynamic cohort.

This study is the result of the effort of many professionals and the trust and generosity of more than 60 000 participants who have understood the interest of providing time, information and samples to learn about the situation of the COVID-19 epidemic in our country.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Pablo Nart for bringing this survey to our attention. The sampling was census tract based to approach a representative sampling of the population. 90 000 individuals were reached with the goal to obtain 60 000 participants. Testing involved rapid on-site testing so participants would know their results along with venipuncture for immunoassay. Preliminary results are based on the rapid test results. The rapid test used was an Orient Gene IgM/IgG test by Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech. According to the company, the test has an 88% and 97% sensitivity for IgM and IgG respectively and a specificity of 98% for IgM and 100% for IgG. At the moment comparison testing between the rapid test and the immunoassay in 16 953 samples analyzed is running 97.3% for IgG.

The study collected extensive demographic and epidemiologic information on the participants. The comparison of week 1 vs week 2 geographically, is interesting as well. Some provinces had higher prevalences in week 2, but other provinces were lower. The full document has multiple tables as well as graphic representation of prevalence rates by province country-wide. - Mod.MPP]

Since "reopening" Wuhan has found 665 asymptomatic infections, expert says infectiousness is low

On [15 May 2020], Wuhan held a consultative meeting of experts in disease prevention and control, where a journalist from Changjiang Daily learned that Wuhan has identified a total of 665 individuals with asymptomatic infections since [8 Apr 2020]. Follow up was done on 2508 individuals with close contact, among whom 2 were found to be asymptomatic infections for a rate of 0.8%, less than 1 in a thousand and neither converted to confirmed [symptomatic] case.

Vice Chairman of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, expert with the Liaison Group of the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council, Feng Zijian, said that the current data said that the infectiousness of Wuhan's asymptomatic carriers is low. Since "reopening", Wuhan has continuously enhanced screening for asymptomatic infections. According to statistics from the China Information System for Diseases Control and Prevention as of [13 May 2020], other than a recent group of 6 confirmed cases, there are 659 asymptomatic infections.

Integrating serologic testing results of asymptomatic individuals, individual tracing, and resolution of symptoms, Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention determined that 559 people had resolved infections, for a rate of 84.8% and 97 were determined to be silent infections for a rate of 14.7%. 3 are unclear.

Virus isolation and culture of samples from 55 asymptomatic infections all found no live virus.

Wuhan CDC took 55 sputum samples and pharyngeal swab samples of asymptomatic patients from [26-30 Apr 2020], and sent them to Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences for cultivation of new coronavirus. None of them produced new coronavirus.

The data show that from [8 Apr 2020] to [13 May 2020], the number of daily nucleic acid screening in our city continues to increase, while the number of asymptomatic infections detected continues to decrease. Among them, an average of 23 people with asymptomatic infections were found every day from [8-30 Apr 2020], and an average of 11 people were found every day from [1-13 May 2020]. The average daily positive detection rate showed a downward trend.

[Our thanks to Dan Silver for providing this article with translation. It is curious that the conversion rate from asymptomatic to symptomatic infection rate is not fully presented. There is mention that there were 97 "silent infections". Apparently the conclusion is that 559 (84.8%) of the "infections" were in fact attributed to past/resolving infections and were not productive of live virus when culture attempted. Further clarification of the results would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP

[5] WHO situation report 116 (as of 15 May 2020)
Date: Fri 15 May 2020
Source: WHO [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200515-covid-19-sitrep-116.pdf


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 15 May 2020.

Highlights
----------
- WHO Regional Director for South East Asia, Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, urged countries in the region to lift public health and social measures (so called lockdowns) in a graded manner and that local epidemiology should guide focused action in 'new normal' COVID-19 world (https://www.who.int/southeastasia/news/detail/15-05-2020-local-epidemiology-should-guide-focused-action-in-new-normal-covid-19-world).

- WHO Regional Director for Europe, Dr Hans Henri P Kluge, emphasized that "our behaviour today, will set the course for the pandemic", and highlighted how behavioural insights are valuable to inform the planning of appropriate pandemic response measures (http://www.euro.who.int/en/media-centre/sections/statements/2020/statement-behavioural-insights-are-valuable-to-inform-the-planning-of-appropriate-pandemic-response-measures)

- A UN policy brief on COVID-19 and mental health (https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/un_policy_brief-covid_and_mental_health_final.pdf) warns that substantial investment is needed to avert a mental health crisis (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/14-05-2020-substantial-investment-needed-to-avert-mental-health-crisis). Reports already indicate an increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety in several countries.

- In the 'subject in focus' below, we highlight WHO's continued collaboration with the aviation and tourism sectors.

Subject in focus: travel and trade
----------------------------------
- Collaboration with aviation and tourism sectors
Since the beginning of the outbreak, WHO has been collaborating closely with the travel and tourism sectors, including sharing information on a regular basis, participating in technical networks, and developing technical guidance (https://www.who.int/teams/risk-communication/travel-and-tourism-sector) and travel advice (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/travel-advice). WHO has also issued joint statements with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (https://www.icao.int/Security/COVID-19/Pages/Statements.aspx), the International Maritime Organization (IMO) (http://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/HotTopics/Documents/Circular%20Letter%20No.4204-Add.2%20-%20Joint%20Statement%20Imo-Who%20On%20The%20Response%20To%20The%20Covid-19%20Outbreak%20(Secretariat).pdf), the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-02-2020-a-joint-statement-on-tourism-and-covid-19---unwto-and-who-call-for-responsibility-and-coordination), amongst others, to reinforce the collaboration and encourage countries to follow the guidance.

WHO is a member of the COVID-19 Aviation Recovery Task Force (CART) (https://www.icao.int/Newsroom/Pages/ICAO-Council-establishes-COVID19-Aviation-Recovery-Task-Force.aspx), an initiative launched by ICAO to identify and recommend strategic priorities and policies to States and industry operators for a safe return to normal operations in the aviation sector. The taskforce comprises representatives from the 36 countries on the Governing Council of ICAO, as well as high-level aviation industry representatives, including the Directors-General of all major air transport industry associations, UN entities such as WHO and UNWTO, and heads of several national and regional aviation administrations.

As part of this Taskforce and within the ICAO Collaborative Arrangement for the Prevention and Management of Public Health Events in Civil Aviation (CAPSCA), WHO has supported the development of ICAO Temporary Guidance on Implementing a Public Health Corridor (PHC) (https://www.icao.int/Security/COVID-19/EBandSL/eb030e.pdf) to protect flight crew undertaking cargo operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The PHC concept has been developed using a risk-based approach and safety management principles for safe operations related to crew, aircraft, airport facilities, and passengers. It provides a framework for harmonizing procedures implemented by States in order to facilitate cross-border cargo operations. Further similar guidance is under development through CAPSCA for humanitarian, repatriation, and scheduled passenger flights. These guidance documents will allow States to implement processes consistently and in accordance with the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) and ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) relating to airports, on-board procedures, facilitation, aircraft operations, air traffic management and navigation.

WHO is also supporting UNWTO in their efforts to help the tourism industry to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, by regularly sharing information and guidance and by providing support to specific industry initiatives:
- The Global Tourism Crisis Committee (https://www.unwto.org/unwto-convenes-global-tourism-crisis-committee), with high-level representatives from across the tourism sector as well as the wider United Nations system, including WHO. The Crisis Committee launched "A Call for Action to Mitigate the Socio-Economic Impact of COVID-19 and Accelerate Recovery - Supporting jobs and economies through travel & tourism" (https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284421633), which provides recommendations in three areas: managing the crisis and mitigating the impact; providing stimulus and accelerating recovery; and preparing for the future.

- The UNWTO "Healing Solutions for Tourism" challenge (https://www.unwto.org/healing-solutions-tourism-challenge), a global call for start-ups, entrepreneurs, and innovators to provide ready-to-implement solutions to mitigate COVID-19's impact on tourism. WHO is a member of the committee that reviewed the submissions for selection of finalists for awards. The challenge selected 12 semi-finalist solutions in the 3 areas of healing: for people, for prosperity, and for destination.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 61 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the South East Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 49 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 44 915 new cases (49.8% of the global newly reported cases), and 2813 deaths (55.5%) were recorded for this 24-hour period. Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 47.7% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil 25.3%, Peru 9.5%, Chile 5.9%, and Mexico 4.1%. The Americas region is maintaining its status as having the highest cumulative case count of the 6 WHO regions, with the European with the 2nd highest.

The European region reported 24 627 new cases (27.3% of the global newly reported cases) and 1864 deaths (36.7%). Russia reported 43.0% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by the UK 14.0%, Turkey 6.6%, Italy 4.0%, Belarus 3.8%, Germany 3.7%, and Spain 3.4%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 11 384 new cases (12.6% of the global newly reported cases) and 169 deaths (3.3%). Saudi Arabia reported 17.9% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Pakistan 16.9%, Iran 15.9%, Qatar 15.2%, Kuwait 8.3%, Afghanistan 6.3%, and the United Arab Emirates 6.1%.

The African region reported 2438 new cases (2.7% of the global newly reported cases) and 56 deaths (1.1%). South Africa reported 27.3% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Zambia 8.5%, Nigeria 7.8%, Algeria 7.8%, Cameroon 6.3%, and Ghana 5.0%.

The Western Pacific region reported 1268 new cases (1.4% of the global newly reported cases) and 42 deaths (0.8%). Singapore reported 59.3% of the newly reported cases, followed by the Philippines 20.3% and Japan 9.0%. Removing Singapore from the denominator has the Philippines at 50.0%, Japan 22.1%, Mongolia 10.9%, Malaysia at 7.8, and South Korea at 5.2%.

The South East Asia region reported 5637 new cases (6.2% of the global newly reported cases) and 129 deaths (2.5%). India reported 70.4% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh 18.5% and Indonesia 10.1%. These 3 countries make of 98% of all reported cases in the region. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 62.3% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia 34.0%, and the Maldives 1.6%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 15 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has decreased. The Americas is increasing, as is South East Asia.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
