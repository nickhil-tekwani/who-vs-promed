Disease Outbreak Worries State
----------------------
The government has expressed worry at the latest outbreak of the dreaded
foot and mouth disease in some parts of Zambia. Vaccinations had been
conducted in the same areas earlier in the year. Agriculture and
Cooperatives Minister, Mundia Sikatana, said in Lusaka yesterday that the
outbreak would have a negative impact on the development of agriculture and
the economy in general. He said Government was more worried at this
particular outbreak because it was in the rainy season, which is a
conducive environment for fast transmission of the disease.
Mr Sikatana said once the disease spread, it would be difficult to curb it.
More resources would have to be committed to fighting the disease. He said
the problem was being compounded by the lack of laboratory facilities,
forcing experts to send samples to Botswana where the tests would be
carried out, and once they were sent back to Zambia, the diagnosis would be
completed and vaccines administered. Mr Sikatana said the recurrence of the
disease was reported at a commercial farm but did not mention the area in
which the farm was located.
"I can't understand why we are not able to operate our own viable labs and
have to send the samples all the way to Botswana. We should not forget that
they are also aiming at perfecting their agricultural sector so they will
give priority to their own tests," he said. Mr Sikatana called on the staff
in the ministry to upgrade their qualifications so that more skilled
manpower would be made available to the nation.
The foot and mouth disease broke out in October 2004 [according to previous
ProMED-mail postings, outbreaks have been reported from Zambia throughout
2004 - Mod.AS] in various parts of the country and resulted in an
escalation of prices of meat products, but Government managed to bring the
disease under control, although the benefit has not been passed down to the
consumer.
