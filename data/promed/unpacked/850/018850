Following the 7th confirmed case of _Neisseria meningitidis_ [serogroup] B infection at Princeton University since March 2013, the school is considering the use of a European Union/Australia-approved vaccine that will protect against this strain of the potentially lethal infection.

CBS New York reports that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has offered the school to use the Novartis vaccine, Bexsero. The CDC has been working with the Food and Drug Administration about gaining access to this particular vaccine, CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds told CNN. "We just got the approval from FDA this week to import the vaccine under the Investigational New Drug Application program," Reynolds said, "Now we're consulting with the Princeton University officials and New Jersey Health Department officials about the next step."

Meningococcal meningitis is caused by a bacteria called _N. meningitidis_ that can infect the lining of the brain and spinal cord. There are a few different types or strains of _N. meningitidis_. In the US, types B, C and Y cause the majority of disease.

Currently, there are 2 vaccines in the United States, meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Menomune), and meningococcal conjugate vaccine (Menactra and Menveo), that protect against _N. meningitidis_. However, they only protect against _N. meningitidis_ serogroups A, C, Y and W-135. There is currently no licensed vaccine that protects against serogroup B in the U.S.

As Reynolds points out in the CNN interview, the Princeton situation is "unique" as it's the 1st time there has been an outbreak in a population where we have an option to control the outbreak using the serogroup B vaccine.

A meningitis vaccine approved for use in Europe and Australia but not in the United States can be imported to try to stop an outbreak of the disease at Princeton University in New Jersey, federal health officials said.

The Food and Drug Administration agreed this week to the importation of the vaccine, Bexsero, for potential use on the Ivy League campus, Barbara Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Saturday [16 Nov 2013].

The school, which has about 7900 students, reported its 7th case of the year [2013] this week, said university spokesman Martin Mbugua.

Bexsero, a new vaccine made by Swiss drug maker Novartis, is designed to protect against a strain of the disease, serogroup B, that is not as common in the United States as it is in other parts of the world, Reynolds said.

The outbreak of serogroup B meningitis at Princeton is rare but not the 1st of its kind in the United States, Reynolds said. "What's a little different now is this is the 1st time we've had an outbreak and also have had the possibility of using a vaccine that could protect against it," she said.

The university's trustees are meeting this weekend to discuss the outbreak. Mbugua would not talk about the nature of those discussions or what day they would be held. "I will not pre-empt the trustees' discussion by talking about it beforehand," he said.

Reynolds said she did not have a timetable for how quickly the vaccine could be available. Its use would be optional for students at Princeton, she said. The most recent case at the school was diagnosed last Sunday, Mbugua said. Six of those affected are students, and one was a visitor, he said.

The student who most recently became ill remains hospitalized, according to the New Jersey Department of Health. Five other students have recovered, and the visitor's case is being followed by another state health department. The 1st case was reported in March 2013.

Meningitis is a serious disease that is spread through coughing and exchanges of saliva, and people living in dormitories or other crowded living quarters are especially at risk. There is a vaccine available in the United States for other strains of the disease, Reynolds said. The CDC recommends the vaccine for children and students before they head off to college.

Bacterial meningitis can cause the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord to swell. The most severe cases can result in death, hearing loss, brain damage, kidney disease or require the amputation of limbs. Symptoms include fever, headaches and stiff neck.

[For a discussion of invasive meningococcal disease on a college campus, see moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (PA) 20090218.0674.

The annual incidence has been 0.3-1.1 per 100 000 persons, or approximately 1400 to 2800 cases, which usually occur as either sporadic cases or at times as outbreaks, usually in closed communities (e.g., college students living in dormitories, particularly freshman, and new military recruits). The highest incidence of meningococcal disease occurs in infants, with a secondary peak in adolescents.

13 serogroups of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease, have been identified based on the bacterial outer polysaccharide capsule, of which 5 serogroups, A, B, C, W-135, and Y, cause the majority of meningococcal disease globally. In the United States, the majority of invasive meningococcal disease is caused by serogroups B, C, W-135, and Y. However, serogroup B accounts for approximately 1/3rd of all invasive meningococcal infections and about half of invasive infections in infants.

The CDC recommends the meningococcal conjugate vaccination for college students and any persons aged 11 to 18 years, military recruits, microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates of _N. meningitidis_, persons who travel to Mecca during the annual Hajj or to countries in which _N. meningitidis_ is hyper-endemic or epidemic, particularly if contact with the local population will be prolonged, persons who have terminal complement component deficiencies, and persons who have anatomic or functional asplenia [without normal spleen function] (http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/559807 and http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm). Also, in an outbreak, the population at risk should be vaccinated with the meningococcal vaccine appropriate for the serogroup causing the outbreak as soon as possible after an outbreak has been declared http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm.

Although there are several vaccines based on the meningococcal capsular polysaccharide that cover serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y, there has been no licensed serogroup B vaccine in the U.S. Because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen, group B vaccines cannot be based on capsular polysaccharide. Vaccines that use outer membrane vesicle protein from an outbreak strain have been used successfully in New Zealand and Cuba to control epidemics in those countries caused by the targeted serogroup B strain, but these vaccines do not cover other strains of serogroup B organisms.

The Novartis Bexsero vaccine contains 4 antigenic components: Factor H Binding Protein (fHbp), Neisseria Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA), Neisserial Adhesin A (NadA), and the outer membrane vesicle protein that is in the New Zealand MenB Vaccine (MenZB) derived from the New Zealand outbreak strain of MenB (strain NZ 98/254) (http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine). The NZ98/254 component, which contains PorA serosubtype 1.4, was effective in a strain-specific outbreak in New Zealand. The Bexsero vaccine contains surface proteins that occur across most serogroup B strains and elicits bactericidal antibodies that can confer protective immune responses (http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/10/19/1013758107.full.pdf). Bexsero is the 1st and only broad coverage vaccine to help protect all age groups against serogroup B disease, including infants who are at the greatest risk of infection (Cohn AC, Messonnier ME. Inching Toward a Serogroup B Meningococcal Vaccine for Infants. JAMA 2012;307(6):614-615.; and, Stephens DS. Comment. Prevention of serogroup B meningococcal disease. Lancet 2012;379(9816):592-594).

The Bexsero vaccine side effects may include soreness at the injection site, and sometimes fever, lack of appetite, muscle aches, irritability and rashes. Almost 8000 people, including more than 5000 infants and toddlers, have had the new vaccine during clinical trials, and the side effects are said to be the usual ones expected with any of the current childhood vaccines (http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine and http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine#sthash.GLMd4xiU.dpuf).

Princeton University is a private university ranked either 1st or 2nd among national universities by U.S. News & World Report from 2001 to 2013, with a highly selective undergraduate program, located in Princeton, New Jersey, United States. There are 5113 undergraduates and 2479 postgraduates (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University#Organization). More than 98 percent of students live on campus in dormitories. Freshmen and sophomores must live in one of 6 residential colleges, while juniors and seniors typically live in designated upperclassman dormitories with the option of living off-campus (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University#Organization). 11 eating clubs serve as dining halls and communal spaces for their members throughout the academic year (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_club_(Princeton_University)). - Mod.ML
