Unknown deadly infection kills patient, doctor
-----------------------------------------------
After the sudden death of a doctor in the ENT (A) ward of the
Khyber Teaching Hospital and serious condition of three other
senior doctors due to a deadly infection, the provincial government
ordered to seal both the ward and operation theatre of the hospital
on Tuesday.

While confirming the incident hospital sources informed that some
other staff members who were admitted in isolated rooms were
fighting for their lives due to the deadly infection. "All the infected
staff members of the hospital are shifted to the side rooms of
private (A) ward and strict measures have been taken on entry and
exit of the hospital staff and their relatives in these rooms," the
hospital sources said. The sources said that the doctor who lost
his life due to the deadly infection was a house doctor.
The provincial health authorities told The Frontier Post that the staff
of the ENT ward had received a patient with severe bleeding from
his nose. Soon after his arrival, the doctors decided to operate
upon him for the purpose of stopping his bleeding.
According to the authorities, the patient, who had been brought
from the North Waziristan agency, died despite efforts of the
doctors. They said that during the night, the hospital staff who had
performed the operation suffered from some serious disease and
fell ill. "All of them had high temperature and got unconscious," they
said.
When investigation was carried out, it was learnt that it was the
result of a deadly haemorrhagic infection, which even caused
sudden death.
According to a press release issued by the hospital administration
the authorities held an emergency meeting and informed the high
officials of the provincial health department. The National Institute
of Health, (NIH) in Islamabad was contacted for expert opinion. [As
a result] the whole area including the ENT ward and operating
theatre were sealed immediately and the patients who had got
infected were shifted to private rooms, the press release added.
The hospital authorities were directed to keep them in isolation.
The condition of doctors was stable and they would be shifted to
their homes today.
One of the assistants of the operating theatre, who is reported to
be serious, is admitted in isolation room No. 16 of the private room
of medical (A). A staff nurse told this scribe that they could not
allow any staff member or relatives of the infected persons to go to
their rooms. She said that the physicians looking after the patients
visited them after taking complete precautionary measures.

[CCHF -- Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever -- is endemic in this
area on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, but the short incubation
period for transmission to the hospital staff (only hours) argues
against that and more for an acute toxic event. Could they have
been exposed to the leak of an anesthetic gas or other product in
the operating theater? - Mod.JW]
