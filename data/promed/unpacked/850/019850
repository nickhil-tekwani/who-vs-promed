Around 11 people have died due to leptospirosis during the past one and half months in Fiji. Fiji's Permanent Secretary for Health James Fong said on [Tue 15 Feb 2022] that most of the deaths were between 16 to 35 years of age, and the youngest one was 6 years old. He said a total of 74 cases were confirmed since January this year [2022], and more people were diagnosed clinically.

After the recent floods, more people were admitted to hospitals for leptospirosis in the Western Division, he said, adding that care delay was attributed significantly to these adverse outcomes. He advised that early treatment can decrease the severity and duration of the disease. Fong said the health ministry has deployed specialist outreach teams to the areas that are regarded as difficult to reach and are at high risk.

Leptospirosis is caused by bacteria that enter the body through skin or eyes, nose, or mouth, especially when the skin is broken. Drinking contaminated water may also cause infection.

Outbreaks of leptospirosis are usually caused by exposure to contaminated water such as floodwaters. In the Pacific island countries, the summer season raises people's risk of contracting leptospirosis due to higher rainfall and frequent flooding.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed widely throughout the world. Although leptospirosis is more common in tropical areas, it is also found in temperate areas. It is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or fresh (not salty) water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. These animals are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira interrogans_.

Many species of wild and domestic animals (including rodents, dogs, cattle, swine, and perhaps river otters) are susceptible to chronic urinary tract infection with _Leptospira_. In these animals, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life, and _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals; for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Leptospirosis is also a risk from household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents.

Leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities such as camping, fresh water swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from _Leptospira_-infected animals.

Outbreaks frequently follow heavy rainfalls, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Conditions favoring rat infestation in urban settings include older housing in poor repair that permits access to food and harborage for rats, inadequate disposal of trash and debris; lumber and firewood piles not stacked off the ground; abandoned automobiles and appliances; dilapidated outbuildings; inadequately maintained sewer systems; and parks, subways, railroad lines, and highways that can provide a suitable habitat.

The news release does not state how the diagnosis of leptospirosis was made in the cases. Because the clinical manifestations of leptospirosis can be non-specific, laboratory confirmation is necessary. The _Leptospira_ Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) can provide in-the-field testing of suspected patients (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC149700/). Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Molecular assays such as DNA PCR can also be used, if available.

Fiji is an island nation in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about 2000 km (1300 mi) northeast of New Zealand's North Island (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji). Fiji is divided into 4 major divisions: Central, Eastern, Northern, and Western. For a map of Fiji's divisions, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fiji_divisions_named.png.

Fiji's wet season is from November to April, with the heaviest rains falling between December and mid-April (http://www.lonelyplanet.com/fiji/weather).

The source for the current outbreak in Fiji is said to be flooding, and recent floods accounted for more people being hospitalized for leptospirosis in the Western Division. - Mod.ML
