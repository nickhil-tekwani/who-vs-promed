2 Contract Malaria at Long Island Camp
---------------------------------
In the first case of locally contracted malaria on Long Island in at
least a decade, two 11-year-old boys caught the disease from
mosquitoes while at a summer camp in Calverton, health officials
said. They had stayed at the Baiting Hollow Boy Scout Camp from
1-7 Aug 1999. But because of the two-week incubation period of
the disease, symptoms did not show until the boys had returned to
their Suffolk County homes.
It is extremely rare for malaria to be contracted within the United
States. Usually the disease is brought here by someone who has
traveled to a tropical or subtropical country where the disease is
more common.
The state Health Department issued a bulletin to hospitals on Long
Island advising them to consider malaria in any patients with
unexplained fever. Suffolk County Health Commissioner Dr. Clare
Bradley said both boys were in good condition and at home with
their parents. They were taking doses of the drug chloroquine for
the disease, she said.
"The working theory is that they acquired it here," Bradley said.
"It's spread by mosquitoes ... There's no person-to-person spread."
Bradley said no records were available yesterday to show when
and where the last malaria case occurred on Long Island, but there
had been none in at least 10 years.
Malaria is a parasitic infection whose symptoms include fever,
chills and sweating that recur every two to three days. Other
symptoms are headache and nausea. The disease, which is
transmitted by the anopheles mosquito, is treatable and usually
identified through a blood test.
The first case was diagnosed by one of the boy's doctors late last
week, but Bradley said the Suffolk County Health Department did
not let the public know because the source of the disease had not
been identified. "We didn't know where this child had contracted it,
whether it was in his home or his Boy Scout camp," Bradley said.
On Monday, a doctor for another boy contacted the health
department, and health officials realized both had stayed at the
camp the same week.

A search of the 200-acre camp, a hilly, woodland area bordered by
the Baiting Hollow State Tidal Wetlands, found mosquitoes with the
disease. Boy Scouts officials closed the camp yesterday to allow
health department officials to spray the area.
Residents who want to take measures to avoid mosquitoes should
use insect sprays and netting and avoid being outside at dusk and
dawn, times when mosquito numbers are high, officials said.
Boy Scouts representatives said they had contacted the parents of
the 1500 Scouts who visited the camp this summer by phone and
letter to inform them of the two cases. "Quite obviously it's a
shock," said Kenneth D'Apice, scout executive for Suffolk County
Council, Boy Scouts of America. "No one thinks of malaria in the
continental United States." Health officials said parents of other
children at the camp and the public at large should not overreact to
the news.
"As with any time their child has a fever, parents should be
concerned but not unduly alarmed," state Health Commissioner
Antonia Novello said in a statement.
The most recent cases of locally acquired malaria occurred in
Queens in 1993. They were the first in the New York metropolitan
area in 4 decades.

[The source must have been a person who had a malaria relapse
while in the area of the camp. We are sure that NY State
epidemiologists are looking into the possibility that one of the Boy
Scouts or their leaders had recently returned from a malarious
country and been at the camp in time to infect the mosquitoes in
mid-July. The parasite would have completed its life cycle in the
local mosquitoes and been ready to infect the boys at the beginning
of August.
I belive that was the story of the case in Queens in 1993. A
summer camp counsellor came from Nigeria, had a malaria
relapse at the camp & infected local mosquitoes which in turn
infected another camp counsellor from Yugoslavia. The poor man
then took a bus trip to California & fell ill there. At first nobody
believed he'd caught malaria in NY State, but there is no malaria in
Yugoslavia.
Another reason for physicians in developed countries to brush up
on their tropical medicine, especially in the hot months of the year,
and for medical laboratories to think of blood smears in cases of
unexplained fever - Mod.JW
