Above-normal rains in northeastern Uganda between July and September
2007 caused floods and water logging leading to crop losses, damage
to infrastructure, reduced access and at least one human death.

In Karamoja [sub-region of Northern Region], a combination of hazards
during the single April to October 2007 season resulted in low
harvests and limited replenishment of household food stocks. The 2007
rains started in May, one month late, and were followed by a dry
spell until August 2007, when above-normal rains returned and caused
low plant pollination and water logging. Incidence of honey dew,
striga (a parasitic weed) and sorghum smut disease, as well as
sorghum stalk borer, also contributed to the region's poor crop
performance.

As a result, household food stocks may not last through the 1st
quarter of 2008, and it is likely that the hunger period will begin
in February or March 2008, one to 2 months earlier than usual. Cereal
prices in Karamoja are also rising, up to 30 to 50 percent above
average in some areas. Food insecurity is expected to increase for
these populations in the 1st quarter of 2008.

[Smuts are a group of fungi causing symptoms of spore-filled galls
(sometimes resembling distorted leaf-like structures) on leaves or
seed heads of a number of cereal hosts. They are spread by wind, rain
and with infected plant material. A number of smut diseases occur on
sorghum, reducing both the grain yield and forage value, which are
caused by different fungi: covered kernel smut (caused by
_Sporisorium sorghi_), loose kernel smut (caused by _Sporisorium
cruentum_), head smut (caused by _Sphacelotheca reiliana_), and long
smut (caused by _Tolyposporium ehrenbergii_ and some other
_Tolyposporium_ species). The kernel smuts can be controlled by
fungicide seed treatments; head smut and long smut may be controlled
by growing resistant varieties. All 4 smuts are present in Africa,
but their patterns of incidence, severity and distribution vary in
different regions. These smuts are economically important and
continue to be a major biotic constraint in the effort to sustain
high sorghum production levels. It is not obvious from the report
which pathogen(s) are responsible for the current problems in Uganda.

The term "honeydew" mentioned in the report describes a sugary
exudate which may be due to insects but is also a diagnostic symptom
of ergot. Ergots are species of the toxin-producing fungal genus
_Claviceps_, which affect a number of cereal crops. In Africa, ergot
of sorghum is caused by _C. africana_. It is an important disease of
this crop in many areas, with losses of up to 80 percent reported. It
is readily identified by the honeydew oozing from the flowers, which
is not as sticky as that produced by aphids. The developing seed is
replaced by a fungal growth which eventually hardens to a
creamy-coloured sclerote (ergot). These ergots are toxic to cattle,
pigs and chickens, and the honey dew causes harvesting problems.
Disease management includes cultural practices and the use of
resistant cultivars. It is possible, but not certain, that ergot may
be responsible for the "honeydew" problem described in the above
report.
