Nationwide alert on unpasteurized orange juice products
-------------------------------------------------------
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a nationwide warning to
consumers against drinking unpasteurized orange juice products distributed
under a variety of brand names by Orchid Island Juice Company of Fort
Pierce, Florida, because they have the potential to be contaminated with
_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhimurium and have been associated with an
outbreak of human disease caused by this organism.
Salmonellosis can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young
children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.
Otherwise healthy individuals may suffer short-term symptoms such as high
fever, severe headache, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea.
Long-term complications can include severe arthritis.
To date, there have been reports of 15 cases of a matching strain of
illness directly linked to a history of consumption of Orchid Island Juice
from mid-May to Jun 2005 in Michigan, Ohio and Massachusetts. In addition,
at least 16 other states have reported cases of serotype Typhimurium
infection that match this specific strain. Further investigations are
underway to determine if these infections are also related to these
products or not.
"FDA is working with the CDC and our state partners to identify the source
of the problem and its scope," said Dr. Robert Brackett, Director of the
FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. "It is important to
note, however, that the vast majority of orange juice sold in stores is
pasteurized and safe to drink."
The unpasteurized product comes in a variety of containers distributed to
retail stores and restaurants under various brand names. The products are
identified on the labels as freshly squeezed or fresh orange juice. The
following labels are involved: Nino Salvaggio's, Westborn Market, and
Natalie's Orchid Island Juice. Orchid Island Juice bottles products under
other brand names that have not yet been provided to FDA by the company.
These products do not bear a warning label that the juice is unpasteurized.
Such warning labels do appear on many unpasteurized juice products, so
consumers should not assume these products are safe to consume simply
because they do not bear the "unpasteurized" warning label.
Individuals who believe they have become ill as a result of drinking this
unpasteurized juice should consult their health care provider and contact
their local health department.

[Since this is not the 1st outbreak of salmonellosis associated with
unpasteurized orange juice, should not it be required that "unpasteurized"
appear prominently on the container? - Mod.LL]
