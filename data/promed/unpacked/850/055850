Hong Kong scientists are warning of a deadly new strain of scarlet
fever that has killed 2 children and infected dozens more in an
outbreak across the city. Mainland China and the former Portuguese
colony of Macau have also seen a surge in scarlet fever cases, which
health officials say is linked to a mutation of the bacterium that
causes the disease. Experts are warning that the scarlet fever
outbreak may yet worsen.

Hong Kong, a densely populated city of 7 million people, is
particularly nervous about infectious diseases. The SARS outbreak in
2003, which began in southern China, killed 300 people in the city.

On Tuesday [? Tue 21 Jun 2011, see news release [3] below], Hong Kong
closed a kindergarten in the Sha Tin area for a week after initial
tests showed that a 5 year old boy might have died from scarlet fever.
A 7 year old girl has also died of scarlet fever in recent weeks, the
1st deaths in Hong Kong from the disease in a decade, Deutsche
Presse-Agentur [DPA] reports.

University of Hong Kong scientists say they have discovered a
mutation of the _Streptococcus pyogenes_ bacterium that causes scarlet
fever, making it more contagious and deadly, Hong Kong broadcaster
RTHK reports. The new strain was resistant to some of the antibiotics
traditionally used to tackle it, resulting in an unusually widespread
and aggressive outbreak in Hong Kong, the scientists said.

Scarlet fever mainly affects children between the ages of 2 and 8. A
record 419 cases have been reported so far in 2011 -- about 3 times as
many as the total number last year [2010] in Hong Kong. There were 142
cases in the 1st half of June 2011.

"We notice that this is a regional phenomenon not limited to Hong
Kong. We found an increased scarlet fever incidence is also found in
mainland China, as well as Macau, so that points to something of a
more diverse, geographical circulation," Thomas Tsang, controller of
the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection, told Channel News Asia.

Dr Tse Hung-hing of the Hong Kong Medical Association told DPA that
doctors should use alternative antibiotics to tackle scarlet fever.

Scarlet fever is named after the strawberry rash it leaves on
victims' tongues. Other symptoms include a fever, sore throat, and
rash on the trunk, neck, and limbs. The illness is usually clinically
mild but can be complicated by shock, heart, and kidney diseases.
While scarlet fever was once a very serious childhood killer, it is
now is easily treatable and rarely fatal in developed countries.

A germ that causes centuries-old scarlet fever has mutated into a new
strain more infectious and toxic for young children. So far one girl
has died -- the 1st in 10 years -- and 2 boys have suffered
complications.

The Department of Health yesterday [20 Jun 2011] issued an alert over
the high level of cases, calling for vigilance against the disease,
which is caused by group A _Streptococcus pyogenes_ bacterium.
Symptoms of the disease include fever, purple tongue, and body
rashes.

University of Hong Kong assistant professor and medical
microbiologist Samson Wong Sai-yin told The Standard: "It is the 1st
time we have seen this kind of mutation in that particular type of
_Streptococcus_." The "unique gene fragment" from a common bacterium
in the mouth was inserted into the genome of the _Streptococcus_
bacterium, with this mix contributing to an increase in
transmissibility in this strain, Wong said.

A spokesman for the Centre of Health Protection last night said: "A
simultaneous increase in scarlet fever cases is also noted in the
mainland and in Macau, suggesting a regional phenomenon at play."

The alert was triggered when a 7 year old girl at St Stephen's
College in Stanley died last month [May 2011]. 2 boys, aged 6 and 11,
also developed complications. The younger boy, in whom the mutant germ
was found, is still in intensive care at Queen Mary Hospital after
developing septicemia, or blood poisoning. The 11 year old had a
throat abscess and swollen face before recovering and being discharged
from Prince of Wales Hospital.

Six "institutional outbreaks" have involved 22 children at 3
kindergartens, 2 primary schools, and one special child-care center
this year [2011] -- most of the outbreaks in the past few weeks. More
than 3 times the number of cases have been diagnosed this year -- 419
-- over last year's 128. But the health department is defending its
decision not to suspend classes where there have been scarlet fever
outbreaks, saying most cases were mild.

Centre for Health Protection controller Thomas Tsang Ho-fai said the
mutation is one of the reasons why the disease is more widespread this
year [2011]. "In the past, cases of scarlet fever would start to
decline in August, but we expect the bacteria will continue to be
active for several more months and throughout this summer," he said.

Scarlet fever is also resistant to the antibiotic erythromycin.
Doctors have been advised to give penicillin or 1st- generation
cephalosporin, said Hong Kong Medical Association council member Tse
Hung-hing.

Delayed treatment has been singled out for the complications and the
girl's death. Wong said: "She died very rapidly, one to 2 days after
admission, because by the time she went to hospital she already had a
very severe disease. It affected many organs including her kidneys,
lungs, and heart." People are advised to maintain good personal
hygiene, wash hands properly, and keep good ventilation.

The Centre for Health Protection is investigating the death of a 5
year old boy, believed to have been infected with scarlet fever. If
confirmed, it will be the 2nd fatality involving the infection this
year [2011].

The centre's controller Dr Thomas Tsang said classes at the boy's Sha
Tin kindergarten have been suspended for a week. The boy came down
with a fever on 15 Jun 2011 and was admitted to Prince of Wales
Hospital on 19 Jun 2011 and moved to Princess Margaret Hospital, but
his condition deteriorated and he died this morning [21 Jun 2011].
Test results are pending. He recently had chicken pox. His home and
school contacts have no scarlet fever symptoms.

With more infections forecast for the summer, the centre will post
daily updates on its website. Dr Tsang said 459 cases have been
recorded so far this year [2011], and urged people to watch their
personal hygiene.

[Scarlet fever, caused by erythrogenic toxin-producing group A
beta-hemolytic streptococci (_Streptococcus pyogenes_), usually
follows streptococcal pharyngitis, but may also follow streptococcal
infection of the skin or soft tissue, such as wounds, burns, the
uterus (that is, puerperal scarlet fever), or even the skin lesions of
chicken pox, as described in one of the patients above. Over a century
ago, scarlet fever was feared as a potentially lethal disease. Its
mortality and morbidity waned, however, well before antibiotics became
available. Since the advent of antibiotic therapy, the mortality rate
of treated scarlet fever has been less than 1 per cent.

Group A streptococcal pharyngitis has rarely caused bacteremia that
can lead to infections at distant sites
(http://www.jstor.org/pss/4456639,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19812863). Tissue invasiveness of
_Streptococcus pyogenes_ has been attributed to several virulence
factors, especially the cell wall M protein, encoded by the emm gene.
Serotypes M1 and M3, in particular, have been associated with invasive
infection. The serotypes of isolates involved in the Hong Kong
outbreak have not been described as yet, nor have any common genotypes
been described. However, an isolate from one of the children who died
was said in the news releases above to have a "mutation of the
_Streptococcus pyogenes_ bacterium that causes scarlet fever, making
it more contagious and deadly."

Half of group A streptococci in Hong Kong have been reported in the
past to be resistant to the antibiotics erythromycin and clindamycin,
but they have all been susceptible to penicillin
(http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110621/hl_nm/us_scarletfever_china),
so that both erythromycin (and related antibiotics) and clindamycin
should not be chosen for empiric therapy in the current Hong Kong
outbreak, before results of antibiotic susceptibility testing are
known. So far there are 419 cases reported in Hong Kong, and from
personal communication about "9000 cases" in neighboring China and an
unknown number in Macau.

The following is extracted from Mod.ML's comments in ProMED-mail post
Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever - Guernsey 20110217.0521:

"Scarlet fever is an infection caused by _Streptococcus pyogenes_,
also known as group A streptococcus (GAS), a Gram positive coccus that
grows in chains. Scarlet fever is usually associated with concurrent
streptococcal pharyngitis, but may be associated with a streptococcal
infection at other sites. An erythrogenic exotoxin released by the
strains of _S. pyogenes_ that cause scarlet fever leads to the red
rash that is characteristic of the illness. The incidence of
pharyngeal disease is highest in school-aged children (5-15 years),
during winter and spring, and in a setting of crowding and close
contact. Person-to-person spread from infected patients by means of
respiratory droplets is the most common mode of transmission. It can
rarely spread through contaminated food
(http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM196904242801702).

"Persons who have GAS sore throat or skin infections are most likely
to spread the infection; those who carry the bacteria but have no
symptoms are less contagious
(http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/groupastreptococcal_g.htm).
A history of GAS sore throat or scarlet fever in the community,
neighborhood, or school may increase the likelihood of infection.

"The incubation period (the time between becoming infected and having
symptoms) is short, generally 1-2 days. The illness typically begins
with a fever, sore throat, and an initially white, then bright red
tongue with prominent red papillae, the so-called "strawberry" tongue
(http://dermatlas.med.jhmi.edu/derm/display.cfm?ImageID=-19962688),
followed 12-48 hours later by a rash. The rash usually first appears
on the neck and chest, then spreads over the body, and is more intense
in skin folds, the so-called Pastia lines
(http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/images/ency/fullsize/19082.jpg).
The rash is described as "sandpapery" to touch. The face may be
flushed with perioral pallor. The rash can last for more than a week
and is followed by peeling (desquamation) of the skin around the
palms, fingertips, toes, and groin area.

"Diagnosis of scarlet fever is clinical. Blood cultures are rarely
positive, but GAS can usually be demonstrated in the throat by culture
or rapid streptococcal test. Complications of scarlet fever include
local spread of the streptococcal throat infection to involve regional
lymph nodes, retropharyngeal tissues, middle ear, and sinuses and
immune-mediated diseases such as acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and
post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Septic complications due to
spread of GAS in blood, such as meningitis, pyogenic arthritis, and
endocarditis, occur rarely.

"Treatment of scarlet fever is no different than that of GAS
pharyngitis, that is, oral penicillin, [cephalosporins], erythromycin,
or clindamycin for 10 days, or one intramuscular dose of penicillin G
benzathine. With proper antibiotic treatment, complications are
uncommon: penicillin therapy for treatment of GAS pharyngitis within 9
days of onset of symptoms has been shown to decrease the incidence of
ARF; unlike ARF, antimicrobial therapy does not prevent acute
post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.

"Early recognition and treatment of GAS pharyngitis is essential to
prevent spread of group A streptococcal infections. Patients should no
longer be infectious after taking antibiotics for 24 hours."
