During the week of 3-9 Aug 2018, the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed 16 additional cases of virulent Newcastle disease [vND] in backyard exhibition chickens in Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, California.

Over the past few weeks, the response team intensified its efforts and identified additional cases of vND within existing disease-control areas. Affected flocks are quickly being euthanized. Together, these actions will help us prevent additional disease spread and eradicate the disease more quickly.

USDA is moving to a weekly announcement of confirmed vND cases, beginning with this report. Cases are still being tested and confirmed as they are identified. If there is a finding in a new state or a different segment of industry, USDA will issue an announcement for that case immediately. A complete list of confirmed cases is available on our website at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animalhealth/vnd.

Virulent Newcastle disease has not been found in commercial poultry in the United States since 2003.

No human cases of Newcastle disease have ever occurred from eating poultry products. Properly cooked poultry products are safe to eat. In very rare instances, people working directly with sick birds can become infected. Symptoms are usually very mild and limited to conjunctivitis. Infection is easily prevented by using standard personal protective equipment.

Samples from the flocks were tested at the California Animal Health & Food Safety Laboratory System (CAHFS). The APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa confirms all findings. APHIS is working closely with the California Department of Food and Agriculture to respond to these findings and to conduct an epidemiological investigation. Federal and state partners are also conducting additional surveillance and testing in the area.

In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or USDA's toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. Additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at Biosecurity for Birds.

[These cases have been found in California since 17 May 2018, according to the USDA website http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animalhealth/vnd.

I know the backyard flocks are scattered, and the inspectors are likely fewer than there are flocks. However, one has to wonder whether we are simply going to be living with this situation for another year or more. Is it the hope that California will have a harsher winter and the situation will self-correct?

This disease is affecting a lot of small-time producers, and it is especially hard on them. We appreciate the USDA going to weekly updates, but more information on exactly what is being done to bring this situation under control would be appreciated. - Mod.TG
