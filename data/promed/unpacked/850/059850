New yellow rust race warning for wheat growers
----------------------------------------------
A fresh race of yellow rust has been detected in the United Kingdom [UK] for the 1st time and wheat growers are being advised to examine crops for abnormal amounts of the disease. The new so-called Kranich race was identified from an isolate collected in 2014 and tested in the field in 2015, with some wheat varieties being slightly more susceptible.

The UK Cereal Pathogen Virulence Survey (UKCPVS) is currently monitoring the new race, but says the actual risk posed by it is unknown at this stage. [They] advise growers to monitor especially those wheat varieties with high resistance to yellow rust.

The Kranich race, named after a winter wheat variety, was first found in Denmark and Sweden in 2011. It is the 1st new race detected in the UK since 2011, the year which saw the Warrior race establish in the UK. The Kranich race is believed to be an exotic incursion similar to the Warrior race, although the 2 are not closely related.

Recently, the European population of yellow rust has been replaced by new invasive strains, almost certainly originating in the Himalayan region and the Warrior group has come to dominate the UK population.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ (previously var. _striiformis_ or _tritici_). The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes, loss of plant vigour, and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge", providing inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease monitoring is important so that timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications and control of pathogen reservoirs. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

While stem rust (_Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_) poses a huge potential threat to world wheat production, stripe rust is currently causing the most damage to wheat crops on a global scale. New strains of both rusts with increased virulence and additional fungicide resistances have been reported in recent years from wheat-growing areas worldwide. Projects for double resistance breeding to manage both stripe and stem rusts simultaneously are in progress (see ProMED-mail post 20120831.1274190).

Up to 2010, exotic strains of stripe rust had only minor impact on European wheat varieties due to host resistance in most of the popular crop varieties. Since then, at least 3 races of non-European origin, including 'Warrior', 'Kranich' (both named after wheat varieties they were first identified on) and 'Triticale aggressive' (with 100 per cent losses in triticale crops) were identified in Europe and are changing pathogen populations in the region. Comparison of genotypes worldwide has indicated that the aggressive strains are being spread by wind currents from Asia (see ProMED-mail post 20150717.3517395 and link below).
