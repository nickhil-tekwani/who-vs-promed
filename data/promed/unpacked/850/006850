The Division of Natural Resources (DNR) and the Raleigh County Health Department have been receiving multiple calls about raccoons infected with rabies, but an official says that many of these cases are not actually rabies.

Wildlife biologist Todd Dowdy said the DNR has seen a huge outbreak of distemper in the area in both raccoons and gray foxes and they display many of the same symptoms as animals infected with rabies.

"If an animal shows clinical signs of rabies, don't approach it," Dowdy said. "Contact our office or the Health Department for assistance."

Both rabies and distemper affect the nervous system and can cause any of the following behaviors: unprovoked aggression, unusual friendliness, disorientation, or paralysis.

"We've received lots of calls in the last few months, most of which are distemper cases," Dowdy said. "Just use common sense and don't approach any potentially infected animal."

He said he cannot emphasize enough that everyone should get their pets vaccinated for both rabies and distemper.

If someone is exposed to a potentially rabid animal, seek medical care immediately.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders. In raccoons, distemper usually results in stumbling and lack of 'shyness', they can seem 'dumb' and/or 'friendly'. Rabid raccoons also might lose their fear to humans and other animals and they may become slower and are brought into stupor, but they present profuse salivation, indiscriminate biting, and odd vocalization. It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs in the area up to date.
