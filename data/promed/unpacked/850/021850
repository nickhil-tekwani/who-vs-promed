Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - The Philippines 8 Jul 2015
-------------------------------------------------------------
On [6 Jul 2015], the IHR National Focal Point of the Philippines notified WHO of 1 laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.

Details of the case
-------------------
The case is a 36 year old man from Finland. Between [10 and 18 Jun 2015], he travelled to Saudi Arabia and stayed in Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam. The patient had cough before travelling to Saudi Arabia; however, while in Saudi Arabia, he did not feel unwell and did not seek medical attention. Investigation of history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing.

On [18 Jun 2015], the patient left Saudi Arabia, stayed overnight in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and travelled to Manila, Philippines on [19 Jun 2015]. He was asymptomatic when he left Saudi Arabia. From [20 to 22 Jun 2015], the patient was in the areas of Taguig and Makati in Manila. Between [23 and 24 Jun 2015], he travelled from Manila to Penang, Malaysia via Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. On [25 Jun 2015], the patient travelled from Penang, Malaysia, to Singapore and from Singapore to Manila. During his travels from Malaysia to Singapore and back to Manila, he was asymptomatic.

On [30 Jun 2015], the patient developed fever and cough and on [2 Jul 2015] he visited a hospital where he had specimens taken for laboratory testing. Against medical advice, he decided to leave the hospital. The patient stayed home on [3 Jul 2015]. On [4 Jul 2015], he returned to the hospital to obtain the results of the tests but the clinic was closed. Then, the patient went to another hospital where he was seen by health care professionals. Once the patient tested positive for MERS-CoV on [4 Jul 2015], he was brought by ambulance to a 3rd hospital and placed in isolation. Currently, the patient is afebrile and remains in stable condition.

Public health response
----------------------
The Philippines Department of Health (DoH) is carrying out active tracing of household and healthcare contacts. The DoH is also actively tracing all passengers on the flights from Singapore to Manila.

The national authorities of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have been informed. Investigations on the possible exposure and contact tracing are ongoing. Enhanced disease surveillance is being implemented.

Global situation
----------------
Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1368 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 487 related deaths.

ProMED-mail rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[According to the WHO update above, during the 14 day incubation period, the Finnish male was in Saudi Arabia and Dubai prior to flying to the Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore and returning to the Philippines. It appears as though the individual was asymptomatic throughout the entire travel time, with onset of fever and cough beginning 2 days prior to diagnosis while in Manila. The possible potential high risk exposures for contact with others was during the period from 2-4 Jul 2015 when he was seen in 3 different health facilities, only one of which was after the laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection was made. It is impressive that the local clinic suspected MERS-CoV and sent specimens for confirmation, as well as the 2nd hospital he visited. That being said, the fact that he was not in isolation during the period waiting for lab results may ultimately be a weak link in terms of possible secondary cases.

The official global tally of MERS-CoV infected individuals reported to WHO is now 1368 including at least 487 related deaths.

[There have now been 5 consecutive days with no newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported from Saudi Arabia. The most recent case was reported on 3 Jul 2015 and was a sporadic case from Turabah (see MERS-CoV (86): South Korea, Saudi Arabia, WHO 20150704.3484493). Notable is that the last case of MERS-CoV infection from Hufoof was reported on 25 Jun 2015, with a date of onset on 19 Jun 2015 -- 19 days ago, only 9 more days to go until 2 incubation periods have passed and transmission in the healthcare environment can be called interrupted (see MERS-CoV (78): South Korea, Saudi Arabia, WHO 20150626.3465211 and MERS-CoV (86): South Korea, Saudi Arabia, WHO 20150704.3484493).
