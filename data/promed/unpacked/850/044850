2 people in the Tomsk Region [Oblast] have died as a consequence of tick-bites.

The number of people who sought medical treatment following tick bites in the Tomsk Region was 20 percent greater than in the previous year [2012]. In 2012, scientists observed a decline in the activity of ticks in the region as a consequence of high temperatures. The cool and humid summer of 2013 has encouraged an expansion in the number of ticks and extended the period of peak tick activity in the forests of the Tomsk Region.

2 deaths from tick-borne encephalitis virus infection have occurred so far in 2013. One was a 70-year-old man and the other a 69-year-old woman; they died in the Tomsk and Asinovsky districts, respectively. Neither of these persons had been vaccinated against tick-borne encephalitis virus.
