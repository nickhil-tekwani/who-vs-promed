South Africa: Horse dies of rabies in Western Cape
--------------------------------------------------
A yearling has died of rabies in the Western Cape, the provincial
agriculture department disclosed yesterday [Fri 9 Feb 2007]. This was
the 1st rabies case in the area in 17 years, said Cobus Dowry, the
agriculture MEC.
Cautioning against alarm, Dowry said it was probably an isolated
case. "We suspect that (the horse) must have been bitten by a rabid
carrier, possibly a bat-eared fox," he said, adding that the carrier
"would have died weeks ago".
The horse had been at pasture on a farm between Somerset West and
Stellenbosch with nine other horses for the past year. The horse was
euthanized on 30 Jan 2007 and a postmortem conducted at the
Stellenbosch Veterinary Laboratory. The Onderstepoort Veterinary
Institute confirmed the presence of rabies in a report on 1 Feb 2007,
said Dowry.
A rabies vaccination campaign was already being conducted in a 3km
zone around the affected farm, he said. An investigation was also
under way to determine the carrier species. Dowry advised farmers in
and around the Helderberg Municipality to be on the alert for wild
animals showing abnormal behaviour, particularly aggression or lack
of fear of people, paralysis or excessive salivation. They were also
asked to look out for carcasses lying around and to report their
findings to the state veterinary Boland office on (021) 808 5253.
