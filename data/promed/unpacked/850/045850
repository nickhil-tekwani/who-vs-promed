Autochthonous malaria in Italy ­ probably not
---------------------------------------------
I would suggest to carefully check this information about autochthonous
malaria in Italy!

First of all, this would not be "the 1st case of malaria in which the
person was infected in Italy since then" (1970), as a previous and well
documented case of vivax malaria had been transmitted by a local mosquito
in 1997, in the "Maremma" of Tuscany (Lancet 1998;351:1246-7).

Secondly, past travel history should be carefully ascertained: in our
practice we have seen several cases of vivax malaria after years (up to > 6
y) after last visiting an endemic area, which would be by no mean exceptional.

As is well known, "endemic" areas for Plasmodium vivax still include
countries such as Southern Turkey relatively close to Italy. And finally,
other forms of "cryptic" malaria do exist and have been reported more
frequently (in non endemic countries including Italy) than cases of
transmission by local mosquitoes.

Therefore I disagree that "It is conceivable that malaria may have returned
to the area". Of all the possibilities, this appears to me by and large the
most unlikely.

I strongly suggest that before disseminating in a hurry unlikely infos,
taken from the general press, that could create alarm (I have personally
already received many mails only this morning), this should checked with
the doctors in charge of the patients, in this case the colleagues from
Spallanzani Hospital!

[ProMED-mail thanks Professor Zeno Bisoffi for his comment. We agree that
there are other more likely explanations for the case than the reemergence
of malaria in Italy, and we will be happy to post further details of the
case. We do not even know the species of malaria and the dates of the visit
to Fondi, and as pointed out above a detailed travel history including
visits to other Mediterranean countries is needed to evaluate where the
patient was infected. - Mod.EP]

Autochthonous malaria in Italy ­ background data
------------------------------------------------
A recent case in the Lake Fondi [not confirmed infected in the Fondi
Region. - Mod.EP] region reminds us that the potential for malaria
transmission persists in Europe.

Sporadic reports of cryptic, airport-, and locally-acquired malaria have
appeared in the Italian literature in recent years.

Historical background:
- malaria was eradicated from Sardinia during 1946 to 1950, through massive
application (267 metric tons) of DDT;
- a single endemic case (_Plasmodium vivax_ in Palma di Montechiaro,
Sicily) was reported in 1956; with sporadic cases in the area of Palermo
during 1962;
- Italy was declared "malaria-free" in 1970;
- a single case of autochthonous malaria (_P. vivax_) was reported in
Maremma (Tuscany) in 1997 -- _Anopheles labranchiae_ was implicated as the
vector.

Although disease rates have increased in recent years due to imported
malaria (see graph at
<http://www.gideononline.com/blog/wp/wp-content/uploads/Mal-Italy11.JPG>),
imported malaria continues to be less common than in neighboring France and
Switzerland. (see graph at
<http://www.gideononline.com/blog/wp/wp-content/uploads/mal-Italy21.JPG>)

Malaria in Italy:
1. 411 000 cases of malaria were reported in 1949;
2. 74 641 cases were reported on Sardinia in 1946, 39 303 in 1947, 15 121
in 1948, 1314 in 1949, 0 in 1950, 9 in 1951, 0 in 1952;
3. 1087 cases of malaria were reported during 1973 to 1982, 5843 during
1986 to 1996 (including 7 transfusion-related, 2 "airport malaria" and 7
cryptic), 3354 during 2002 to 2006 -- 71 per cent among foreigners;
4. 98 per cent of cases reported during 1989 to 1997 were imported, 106
characterized as relapses and 19 acquired in Italy;
5. 407 cases of imported malaria among children ages 0 to 18 were reported
during 1992 to 2002 -- 82 per cent due to _P. falciparum_;
6. 86 per cent to 92 per cent of cases were acquired in Africa (1995 to 2006);
7. 73 per cent of malaria cases reported during 1986 to 1997 were caused by
_P. falciparum_ and 20 per cent _P. vivax_;
8. _P. falciparum_ accounted for 74 per cent of cases during 1989 to 1997;
84 per cent during 1999 to 2000; 85 per cent during 2002 to 2006.

Vectors:
- the potential vectors for Italy are _Anopheles superpictus_ and _An.
labranchiae_;
- _An. atoparvus_ was once active in transmission, and is still present in
Tuscany (Fucecchio and Cerbaie woodlands, Grosseto and Siena);
- _An. sacharovi_ was previously found in Puglia and Sardina, but was
absent as of 1994. _An. labranchiae_ is found in Tuscany (Grosseto Province
and areas of intensive rice cultivation), Apulia (coastal plains of the
Adriatic from Lesina lake to the Candelaro River), Calabria (coastal plains
of the Tirrenian and Ionian sides and the close hinterland), Puglia, Sicily
(rural coastal and hilly areas), and Sardinia (rural coastal and hilly areas);
- _An. superpictus_ is found in Calabria (coastal plains of the Tirrenian
and Ionian sides and the close hinterland) and Sicily (rural coastal and
hilly areas).

[ProMED-mail thanks Professor Steve Berger for providing background
information on malaria in Italy since the Second World War. Even though 19
cases were acquired in Italy, it does not mean that there is a sustained
reservoir in Italy and sustained transmission from such a reservoir, but
rather that limited transmission is possible from gametocyte carriers
infected abroad. - Mod.EP]
