A scientific study along the Angabanga River in Mekeo has found that
73 per cent of people from 8 villages in Mekeo and Goilala have been
diagnosed with the mosquito borne disease [virus] Japanese
encephalitis (JE) [It is not clear whether this 73 per cent had
disease or had antibodies reflecting past JE virus infection, which
seems more likely. - Mod. TY].

The disease was mistaken for malaria or dengue fever by the
sufferers, the study by Dr Takatua Taufa, a PNG citizen and former
associate professor of public health and tropical medicine at the
James Cook University in Australia, revealed.

Dr Taufa's study covered the Auga River, a tributary of the main
Angabanga River in Kairuku District of Central Province. The tests
were carried out at the Mekeo villages of Gagaifua, Veifa'a,
Oriropetana, Inauwaia, Oreke, Inika and in the Goilala villages of
Tula and Polomononia. Test results were sent to 2 separate
laboratories in Queensland and Sydney for comparability of data [Test
results or samples for testing? Mod.TY].

Dr Taufa said this disease has been mostly mistaken because of its
similar symptoms. He said the same mistake was made during World War
II when Australian troops fought along the Kokoda Trail amid wet and
difficult conditions and had taken ill with malaria type symptoms.

Dr Taufa said there were significantly more dengue positives among
the study than control groups, with evidence that the transmission
cycle was also similarly continued to that of the JE results [the
meaning of this statement is not clear. - Mod.TY].

According to the World Health Organisation, JE is a viral disease
that infects animals and humans. It is transmitted by mosquitoes [to]
humans, and causes inflammation of the membranes around the brain.

It is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia, with 30 000 to
50 000 clinical cases reported annually, and [the mosquito vector]
usually breeds in flooded rice fields. Its usual hosts are birds and
pigs; however, flooding leads to explosive build up of the mosquito
population, which results in the virus spilling over to humans.

JE is caused by flavivirus that affects the membranes around the
brain. Signs of JE are mild (fever and headache) or without apparent
symptoms, but about one in 200 infections results in severe disease,
characterised by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness,
disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis and death.

According to Dr Phillip Golpak, the Acting Director of Medical
Services at the Port Moresby General Hospital, a vaccine is not
available at the hospital because reported cases are rare to none. He
said the virus can be treated with supportive care from relatives to
ensure the patient takes plenty of fluids and nutrition.

[In 1998, 2 Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases were confirmed in the
North Fly District, Western Province, the 1st for Papua New Guinea.
These 2 cases were from Kokonda and Ipoknai. This is the 2nd ProMED
report of Japanese encephalitis virus infections in Papua New Guinea.
Unfortunately, not enough information is provided in the current
report to know which tests were done that led to the conclusion that a
large percentage of the study population had JE virus infection.
Perhapas the tests were serological rather than clinical cases, with
the related risk of cross-reactions with other flaviviruses that could
complicate interpretation of results. This report indicated that there
were dengue positives, also flaviruses and also presumably determined
serologically. However, this geographic area is within the
distribution range of JE virus and JE virus infections were diagnosed
13 years ago in a different province. More details of the current
study would be of interest.
