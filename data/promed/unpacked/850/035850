Health workers in Cameroon are fighting a cholera outbreak that claimed 13 lives this week in 2 major cities of the central African state. The outbreak, which has affected several hundred people, comes as Cameroon prepares to host the African Football Cup of Nations, or AFCON, in about 2 months. Cameroon's health minister Manaouda Malachie in a release this week said thousands of civilians in the capital city Yaounde and Ekondo-Titi, an English-speaking western town, are threatened by cholera.

Cholera is an infectious and often fatal bacterial disease of the small intestine, typically contracted from infected water supplies and food. It causes severe vomiting and diarrhea and can kill within hours if left untreated.

Amos Kome Njikang, the medical doctor in charge of the Ekondo-Titi Hospital, dispatched health workers to the community to search for and transport cholera patients to the hospital. "4 more cases came in between yesterday [Wed 3 Nov 2021] and early this morning [Thu 4 Nov 2021]," he said. "We have made plans for the transportation of new cases from the community to the health facility at Bamousso. We have also tried to increase personal hygiene, hand washing, washing of whatever we consume. We are trying to tell them how to purify water before they drink."

The health ministry said several hundred patients were rushed to hospitals in Yaounde and Ekondo-Titi. The government said it recorded at least 13 cholera-related deaths in the 2 towns since [Mon 1 Nov 2021]. It is feared the outbreak may have claimed more lives in villages which lack health infrastructure. This week, the Ministry of Health said it dispatched several dozen health workers to warn civilians that eating uncooked food and unwashed fruits, or drink water that's not boiled, increases the risk of getting cholera.

The cholera outbreak comes as Cameroon prepares to host the African Football Cup of Nations, AFCON, starting on [9 Jan 2022]. Yaounde, which will host teams from 8 African nations in the continental soccer event, has reported at least 100 cholera cases.

At a press conference on [Tue 2 Nov 2021], Yaounde mayor Luc Messi Atangana said he is cleaning up the city and improving the drinkable water supply to stop cholera from spreading. He said the outbreak is provoked by increased refuse dumped by civilians on street corners, and he has hired 30 trash trucks to add to 200 others that clear Yaounde of municipal solid waste. He expects Yaounde to be clean and free from cholera within the next 2 weeks.

The health ministry said the cholera outbreak may be difficult to contain. Less than 30% of the population visits hospitals either because of ignorance or because some civilians prefer traditional African medicine. Health workers are urging civilians to refer suspected cholera cases to the nearest hospitals.

The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has announced 21 additional deaths from cholera disease and 417 fresh cases, representing a case fatality rate (CFR) of 5% reported from 7 northern states. The centre disclosed this in its latest cholera situation weekly epidemiological report for 11 to 17 Oct 2021, which was published on its website. The report revealed that as of [17 Oct 2021] Nigeria has recorded a total of 3283 deaths and 93 362 suspected cases across 32 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory, representing a CFR of 3.5%.

The latest cholera report, which is for week 41, revealed that 7 states that reported the new suspected cases are all in the nation's northern region. North eastern states of Yobe, Adamawa and Borno accounted for 67 of 417 suspected cases, with 121, 86 and 71 cases reported respectively. Zamfara in the north west ranked 4th with 67 cases, followed by Niger in the northcentral with 49 cases. Also, Katsina and Kaduna in the northwest reported 14 and 9 cases, respectively.

The data in the reporting week shows a 22% decrease in the number of new suspected cases in week 41 compared with week 40 where 535 suspected cases were recorded. During the reporting week, the NCDC said 23 Cholera Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT) were conducted with 11 in Zamfara, 5 in Borno, 5 in Adamawa, and 2 in Kaduna. Out of the figure, a total of 15, amounting to 65% returned positive by RDT. The centre added that a total of 4 stool cultures were carried out with 2 each in both Zamfara and Borno, noting that 2, amounting to 50%, returned positive.

The NCDC also noted that of the cases reported, there were 21 deaths from the 5 states reporting with a weekly case fatality ratio (CFR) of 5%.

[As stated by Lutwick et al. (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Edited by Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally, glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the first 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the first 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
