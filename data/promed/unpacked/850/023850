Asia is witnessing an ongoing evolution of a serious pandemic caused by
Type O FMD virus of a topotype which has been called the "South Asian
topotype". The seeds for expansion of this new virus were set 10 years ago
when its appearance and subsequent spread were detected in South Asia.

There are gaps in the molecular epidemiological record put together by the
Pirbright Laboratory (FAO/OIE World Reference Laboratory for FMD) but a
clear pattern of relentless spread is evident. In West Asia, by 1994 it had
spread to the Arabian Peninsula and then moved northwestwards as far as
Europe. It was responsible for the serious losses in Iraq documented in
1998/9 and many other countries in the Near East. Until molecular
characterisation data are available for the Georgian outbreak, it is not
possible to know if this outbreak is related or if one of the other FMD
serotypes circulating in the area is responsible.

Expansion of the South Asian topotype eastwards has been most alarming with
outbreaks in Malaysia (1995), Tibet Autonomous Region of China (1999),
Taiwan Province of China (1999) and then rapid expansion in the Far East
this year - Japan, South Korea and Vladivostok in the Russian Federation.
Whether or not the Mongolian epidemic is related remains to be determined.

Despite the gaps, it is fairly clear what has happened, but to answer your
question "Why is FMD raging through Asia?" is more difficult. The
underlying cause is probably the expanding global trade (both formal and
informal) in live animals, meat, animal products and potential fomites,
such as animal feeds, without adequate safeguards being implemented to
prevent the movement of FMD virus at the same time. Once the virus has been
introduced, lack of emergency preparedness (effective contingency planning)
in many countries mitigates against early elimination. Characteristics of
the virus itself might also be involved since this is a most aggressive and
'successful virus which has been able to displace all other FMD Type O
viruses in West Asia.

Epidemiological investigations are continuing and these will assist in
answering your question. A fuller account of events is being put together
by the WRL staff and this should help to answer the many questions.
Available information will also be reviewed at an OIE meeting in Japan in
the near future and hopefully a clearer picture will emerge.

[I am very thankful to Peter for his regional review of the FMD situation
and look forward to their further reports. From other information it seems
that the upcoming OIE meeting in Japan will be lively. However, a regional
FMDv report has been promised us by Pirbright in the next few weeks. -
