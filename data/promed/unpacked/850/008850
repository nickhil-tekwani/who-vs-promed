CHOLERA - INDIA: NEW STRAINS? (02)

There is a problem with the [post] published on ProMED-mail [see ref.
above]. The increase in cases that Dr. Nair was referring to occurred in
1996-97. The ProMED-mail report, in my opinion, made it sound like a
current, rapidly emerging pathogen.
The following is from Dr. Nair's publication in J. Microbiology March 1998:
"There was an inexplicable upsurge in the incidence of non-O1, non-O139
_Vibrio
cholerae_ among hospitalized patients admitted to the Infectious Diseases
Hospital, Calcutta, India, between February and March 1996. Of the 18
strains of _V. cholerae_ isolated during this period, 15 belonged to the
non-O1, non-O139 serogroups (4 belonged to O144, 3 belonged to O11, 1 each
belonged to O6, O8, O12, O19, O39, and O58, and 2 strains could not be
typed), 2 belonged to the O139 serogroup, and 1 belonged to the O1
serogroup.
"Cell-free culture supernatants of 13 representative non-O1, non-O139 _V.
cholerae_ strains evoked a distinct cytotoxic effect on CHO and HeLa cells,
and the strains examined produced the nonmembrane-damaging cytotoxin. By
several PCR assays, it was determined that none of the non-O1, non-O139
strains were positive for the ctxA, zot, ace, and tcpA genes and for the
genes representing the heat-labile toxin, heat-stable toxin, and verotoxin
of _Escherichia coli_ and the various variants of these genes.
"Studies on the clonality of non-O1, non-O139 _V. cholerae_ strains by
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of rRNA genes and
of other genes (hlyA, hlyU, hlx, toxR, and attRS1) and by pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) collectively indicate that the upsurge which occurred
in February and March 1996 was caused by strains belonging to different
clones.
"Overall, there was an excellent correlation between the results of
ribotyping, RFLP analysis of various genes, and PFGE, with strains belonging
to a particular serogroup showing nearly identical restriction patterns and
PFGE profiles. It is clear from this study that some serogroups of _V.
cholerae_ can cause diarrhea by a mechanism quite different from that of
toxigenic _V. cholerae_ O1 and O139, and we have proposed the nomenclature
of enteropathogenic _V. cholerae_ to include these serogroups. "
------------------
Now, We have known that NAG's can cause diarrhea from mechanisms other than
CT [cxytotoxin], and Dr. Nair has confirmed this -- but I feel that the
"emerging disease" interest is misplaced.

[We were misled by the news agency report, which made no mention of the date
of the outbreak, and in fact made it sound current, since it was presented
at a meeting a week ago. It did not mention that the work had been
published a year ago. A question for Laura: is the mention of multi-drug
resistance also not news? - Mod.JW]
