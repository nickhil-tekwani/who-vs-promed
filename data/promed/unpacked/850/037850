outbreak of infection with _Salmonella_ Typhimurium U292 in Denmark,
February-July 2008. Eurosurveillance 2008; 13(28)]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Denmark is currently experiencing an unusually large outbreak of
gastrointestinal illness caused by _Salmonella [enteric_ serotype]
Typhimurium, phage type U292. The outbreak was discovered in early
April 2008 by molecular typing (MLVA typing) of _S._ Typhimurium
isolates at the Statens Serum Institut (SSI); the 1st patients
reported onset on illness in February 2008, but the number of
reported cases has been particularly high in May and June 2008
(Figure 1 [for figures, see source URL - Mod.LL]). There are
currently (as of 7 Jul 2008) 366 confirmed cases, effectively making
this the largest outbreak of salmonellosis in Denmark since 1993 (1).

Based on 2 urgent inquiries through the European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control's Food and Waterborne Disease network (on 17
Apr 2008 and again on 18 Jun 2008), the outbreak appears to be fully
confined to Denmark; no cases have been reported from other countries
including neighboring Scandinavian countries or Germany. The outbreak
affects all parts of Denmark, although the incidence varies in
different parts of the country. The gender distribution is even (49.7
percent males), but the age distribution is skewed towards young age
groups with roughly 50 percent of cases being younger than 15 years
compared to roughly 30 percent in the group of _S._ Typhimurium
patients reported in previous years. There are several instances in
which 2 cases belong to the same family, but otherwise no embedded outbreaks.

The source of the outbreak has so far not been found and the outbreak
appears to be ongoing. This outbreak has led to an extensive
investigation using different methods among which are patient
interviews (including focus group interviews and home visits), 2
case-control investigations, comparative analyses of patients'
shopping lists obtained from supermarket computers, geographical and
trace-back analyses, subtyping of isolates obtained in the
surveillance programmes of food, animals, and slaughterhouses in
Denmark, microbiological analyses of food collected from patients'
homes and of selected food production facilities. The results of
these investigations indicate that the outbreak may be caused by
several types of food vehicles. The main working hypothesis is that
the outbreak originates from pigs, but other ideas are also under
investigation. Should anyone have information that may be of value to
the investigation team please contact the authors.

The phage type U292 is very rarely detected in Denmark and other
countries. The phage type pattern is: phage 11: +++, phage 14:
+++/SOL, phage 26: +/++, phage 35: +/- and with negative reaction in
all other routine phages. The MLVA pattern is (in base pairs):
162-246-341-369-524, in the order: STTR9-STTR5-STTR6-STTR10-STTR3.
The outbreak strain is fully susceptible to all antibiotics in the
Enter-net panel.

[It is interesting that both this outbreak of salmonellosis and the
larger one in the USA have been ongoing and being studied for several
months without a clear cut vehicle of transmission. They illustrate
the complexities of the current food distribution chains and
potential cross-contamination points.
