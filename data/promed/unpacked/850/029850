Faced with the reality that the illegally introduced RCD virus [Rabbit
hemorrhagic disease virus; known in New Zealand and Australia as "rabbit
calicivirus" and the disease it may cause as "rabbit calicivirus disease"]
is clearly established in the South Island, the Government will move to
legalise its ongoing spread, Hon Simon Upton, announced today.
The Government is clear that there are compelling reasons to act swiftly.
These include the need to: provide clear advice on how to handle the virus
safely and effectively, assist the Department of Conservation in its
efforts to protect threatened native species from predators deprived of
their regular rabbit prey, [and to] monitor any risks to humans and other
non-target species.
"Without legalisation the Government and the public are left in the dark as
to what is going on. That is not a satisfactory state of affairs," Mr Upton
said.
The Government therefore intends to pass regulations under the Biosecurity
Act to make it legal to possess RCD. Such regulations would not
retrospectively legalise the actions of farmers who have spread RCD to
date. In the Ministry of Agriculture's view a distinction can and should
be drawn between the person or persons involved in the importation and
initial distribution of the virus, and those involved in subsequent spread,
after it
had replicated in New Zealand rabbits and became established over a wide area.
"Given the need to move swiftly to place the spread of the virus on a
managed basis, interested parties will have one week from Wednesday 10
September in which to comment on the need for and intent of such
regulations, "Mr Upton said.
The Minister said he had spoken to Federated Farmers' High Country
Committee Chairman and the National President of Federated Farmers prior to
this announcement. They had indicated their willingness to work with the
Ministry of Agriculture. "I have instructed MAF to organise a series of
meetings with farmers, Landcare groups, DOC and other interested parties to
coordinate the collection of information and to provide a forum for the
ongoing dissemination of current and future information."
The decision to manage the illegally imported virus, rather than resort to a
fresh importation, flowed from MAF's analysis, in consultation with
independent experts in virology, which indicated that importation of a
`pure' strain was not justified.
Technical reasons against the importation of the Australian RCD seed-stock:
1. the strain of virus being released in New Zealand is clearly virulent
(i.e., it is killing rabbits),
2. there is no evidence suggesting that the Australian strain would be any
more effective than the current South Island farmers' "Kitchen Whiz" strain
either as a biocontrol agent, spreading naturally without man's
intervention, or as a biocide, where it kills rabbits which eat infected bait,
3. providing farmers only select livers from rabbits that have died of
RCD, there is likely to be no difference in effectiveness between "Kitchen
Whiz" strain and the Australian strain,
4. the presence of an avirulent (harmless) strain in Australia has been
suspected; however it is equally likely that an avirulent strain may have
already been present in New Zealand prior to the illegal introduction of RCD,
5. the virulent virus affects the liver while the avirulent strain is
reported to affect [replicate asymptomatically in?] the gastrointestinal
tract,
6. while avirulent strains are believed to occur in many countries, there
are no records of virulent strains [becoming avirulent],
7. while the probability is very low, it is possible that if there is an
avirulent strain in Australia it could be present in the Australian
seed-stock,
8. even virulent strains will not kill all rabbits and traditional control
methods are needed to kill survivors,
9. Australian virus is not available for immediate release - it is only
available as seed-stock and would need to be [amplified] before being
distributed and released,
10. multiplication of the virus in New Zealand would take at least four
months and possibly much longer if the product needs to be registered as a
pesticide,
11. even if the Australian seed-stock was imported, [amplified] and
released, it would not displace the New Zealand strain, already well
distributed in the South Island,
12. importing the Australian seed stock would not change the other
biosecurity risks that we have already been exposed to by the illegal
importation.

[The New Zealand Government seems to be just behind the curve. I thought
the originally released strain (now known as "the New Zealand strain") was
imported from Australia. Would someone please comment on this possible
misconception of mine? It is remarkable to me just how far Australia and
New Zealand will go to maintain the distinctions between them. Now New
Zealand is talking about the "Australian strain" of Rabbit hemorrhagic
disease virus. Harrumph! Where did the Aussies get the virus they
accidentally released? -- Mod CHC]
