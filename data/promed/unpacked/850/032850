Health officials have advised anyone who has been in the Sydney CBD [central business district] in the past 10 days to be on the lookout for symptoms of Legionnaires' disease. A total of 5 people who have since been hospitalised were infected with the bacteria that causes the disease, having spent time in the area in the past 3 weeks.

Legionnaires' is often associated with contaminated cooling towers of large buildings and results from breathing in contaminated water particles. Symptoms include fever, chills, a cough and shortness of breath which can lead to severe chest infections such as pneumonia.

Two women and 3 men, ranging in age from their 40s to 70s, that have tested positive spent time between Museum Station, York Street, Park Street and Martin Place.

Legionnaires' disease cannot be spread from person to person.

It follows a number of other cases recently detected across Sydney. Environmental health officers are working with the City of Sydney to review testing and maintenance records of all cooling towers in the CBD.

"Public Health Units across NSW follow up every case of Legionnaires' disease and work closely with local councils in the management of cooling towers," NSW Health said in a statement. "Routine testing of cooling towers helps identify contamination early and allows for prompt cleaning and corrective actions."

[Humans acquire Legionnaires' disease after exposure to natural or human-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. Possible person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease has also been described (Correia AM, Ferreira JS, Borges V, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374: 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds.

More than 70% of cases of Legionnaires' disease are due to _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand, where _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has accounted for only 45.7% of cases of community-acquired legionellosis and 30.4% are _L. longbeachae_ (Yu VL, Plouffe JF, Pastoris MC, et al. Distribution of _Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by culture in patients with sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: an international collaborative survey. J Infect Dis. 2002; 186(1): 127-8; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/186/1/127/837207).

Possible sources include aerosols generated from a _Legionella_-contaminated plumbing systems by showerheads, sink faucets, misters, decorative fountains, hot tubs/spas, car-wash facilities, as well as a building's cooling towers (structures that contain water and a fan as part of centralized air cooling systems), and even wastewater treatment plants. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

However, Legionnaires' disease due to _L. longbeachae_ is associated with exposure to aerosols generated during the use of non-sterilized potting soil, which apparently contains free-living amoebae and elevated storage temperatures may foster the intra-amoebic growth of _L. longbeachae_ in the potting soil (Ross IS, Mee BJ, Riley TV. _Legionella longbeachae_ in Western Australian potting mix. Med J Aust. 1997; 166(7): 387; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.5694/j.1326-5377.1997.tb123175.x).

A cluster of cases usually refers to multiple cases in space and time that are possibly linked, as is the case now in the central business district of Sydney. An outbreak of Legionnaires' disease implies a common source is suspected (https://legionnaires.ecdc.europa.eu/?pid=205). Culture for _Legionella_ in sputum and suspected environmental sources and genotyping the isolates will help delineate transmission pathways. A common source is suggested if the genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens match; genotyping environmental isolates of _Legionella_ can point to the possible source for those patients if the environmental and patient genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease in the 5 Sydney patients was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no patient isolates for genotyping.

Sydney, located on Australia's southeast coast, with a population of about 4.8 million residents, is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney).
