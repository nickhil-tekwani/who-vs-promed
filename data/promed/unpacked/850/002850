[2] CFIA warning

The public warning issued on 17 Aug 2007 has been updated to include
additional information on product distribution. The affected product
was also sold in Manitoba. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)
is warning the public not to consume Los Angeles Salad Company Baby
Carrots described below because the product may be contaminated with
_Shigella_.
The affected product, Los Angeles Salad Company Genuine Sweet Baby
Carrots, is labelled as product of Mexico and imported by Los Angeles
Salad Company. It is sold in 672 gm/1.5 lb plastic bags bearing ITM
50325, UPC 8 31129 00137 7 and 'sell-by' dates up to and including 13 Aug 2007.
This product was sold in Costco stores in British Columbia, Alberta,
Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and Newfoundland. There have been 4
confirmed illnesses associated with the consumption of this product.
Food contaminated with _Shigella_ may not look or smell spoiled.
Shigellosis infection can cause diarrhea (which may be bloody),
fever, nausea, and vomiting. Illness usually lasts from 4 to 14 days.
In some persons, especially very young and very old people, and
people with compromised immune systems, the diarrhea can be more
severe. Infection can occur after eating and drinking food and water
that is contaminated with _Shigella_ and can be passed from person to person.
Costco Wholesale, Ottawa, Ontario, is voluntarily recalling the
affected product from the marketplace. The CFIA is monitoring the
effectiveness of the recall. For more information, consumers and
industry can call the CFIA at 1-800-442-2342 / TTY 1-800-465-7735
(8:00 am to 8:00 pm Eastern time, Monday to Friday).

[The species of _Shigella_ involved in this posting is not stated.
Most ProMED-mail reports regarding shigellosis are included in the
Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery reports, but since this posting
involves an active foodborne outbreak, it is posted as a stand-alone post.
The following is abstracted from the US FDA (Food & Drug
Administration) Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Bad Bug
Book (<http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap19.html>):
"The illness caused by shigellosis accounts for less than 10 percent
of the reported outbreaks of foodborne illness in this country.
_Shigella_ rarely occurs in animals; principally it is a disease of
humans except other primates such as monkeys and chimpanzees. The
organism is frequently found in water polluted with human feces. The
infective dose is as few as 10 cells depending on age and condition
of host. The _Shigella_ spp. are highly infectious agents that are
transmitted by the fecal-oral route.
Associated foods include salads (potato, tuna, shrimp, macaroni, and
chicken), raw vegetables, milk and dairy products, and poultry.
Contamination of these foods is usually through the fecal-oral route.
Fecally contaminated water and unsanitary handling by food handlers
are the most common causes of contamination."
Clearly unlike foodborne infections in humans due to _Salmonella_
(except for typhoid fever), _E. coli_ O157, and _Campylobacter_,
shigellosis is associated with food contamination with human, not
animal feces. - Mod.LL]
