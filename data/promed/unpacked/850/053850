More Dead Birds Infected with West Nile Virus Found Across Georgia
------------------------------------------------------------------
Having just read the latest 4 Aug report [WEST NILE VIRUS SURVEILLANCE 2001
- USA (15) 20010804.1532 of the ongoing spread of West Nile virus, I
couldn't help but notice that the state of Georgia was not included in the
coverage of state reports.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Fri 3 Aug 2001 published details of the
further spread of West Nile virus infected birds across Georgia. Cases of
Eastern Equine Encephalitis in Florida and Georgia are reported in the same
issue.
On Fri 3 Aug 2001 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution stated that 12 more West
Nile virus infected dead birds have been found by Georgia health
authorities in 6 additional counties in Georgia. Northernmost is Stephens
County (Toccoa), which borders South Carolina and is part of the
Appalachian foothills. Also, Dougherty County (Southwest Georgia - with the
city of Albany) reports the finding of a West Nile virus infected bird.
[The remaining counties are in southeast Georgia. This brings the total of
West Nile virus infected birds found in Georgia to 22 as of Fri 3 Aug 2001.

[The press report (by M.A.J McKenna) also states that the latest findings
include crows, robins, grackles and a cardinal in Charlton, Clinch,
Dougherty, Echols, Lanier and Stephens counties. No additional birds had
been found in metro Atlanta. Previously, the state health authorities had
announced the discover of an infected hawk in north DeKalb County, and 2
infected birds in Atlanta's Piedmont Park. "I think [that West Nile virus
is, at least in low levels, probably nearly everywhere," said Dr. Susan
Lance-Parker of the Georgia Division of Public Health. "Probably the
factors playing into (when birds are discovered) are how much virus there
is in an area and how many people are interested in turning in dead birds;
and that depends in part on how many people actually are in an area." - Mod.CP
