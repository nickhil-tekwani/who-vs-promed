Russia: hepatitis A sickness rate in Tver Region reaches 662
------------------------------------------------------------
The number of people who have fallen ill with hepatitis A in south western
districts of the Tver region has reached 662, including 182 children, a
source in the crisis headquarters set up to combat the epidemic told
Itar-Tass on Wed 22 Jun 2005. 2 people, including one child, fell during
the past 24 hours. They are residents of the town of Rzhev and the Rzhev
district, the source said.
As of 9:00 AM, Moscow time, 241 people have been discharged from hospitals.
Of the 63 people who contracted hepatitis A in the Zubtsovsky district, 41
people have already recovered. In the Oleninsky district, 14 of the 34
people have been discharged from the hospital. A hepatitis diagnosis has
not been confirmed in the case of 28 suspected hepatitis contacts.
The hepatitis outbreak is coming to an end in the region, but more cases
might be reported because of the epidemiological process characteristic of
this disease, medics said.
Moscow has not reported an outbreak of the disease, but the hepatitis
sickness rate in the Russian capital increased 1.5 times in the first 5
months of 2005 compared with the same period last year [2004]. The city's
State Sanitary and Epidemiological Service said hepatitis in the designated
period had sickened 1130 people, including 164 children. The hepatitis
sickness rate among children had increased 31.4 per cent. "Whereas some 270
hepatitis cases were registered each month in the period from January
through March [2005], the number of contacts decreased to 180 in April and
to 136 in May 2005," the service said.
176 people fell ill with hepatitis A in Moscow from 20 Apr to 14 Jun 2005,
including 16 children. As many as 157 adults and 15 children were
hospitalized. There are no indications pointing to a possible hepatitis
outbreak in the Russian capital; 96 per cent of cases appear sporadic.
Vaccination against hepatitis A among high-risk groups in Moscow is
underway. A total of 1500 people have already been inoculated,
epidemiologists said.

[The hepatitis A outbreak in the Tver region has been unusually large (when
contrasted with the sporadic case rate in Moscow). The gradual decline of
the outbreak is consistent with the identification of the source of the
outbreak as a breach of hygiene at a large supplier of both alcoholic and
non-alcoholic drinks to the region. Further information on the precise
nature of the source of the contamination might be useful to others. - Mod.CP]
