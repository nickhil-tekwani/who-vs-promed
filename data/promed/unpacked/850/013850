UMass Amherst [University of Massachusetts at Amherst] is preparing to vaccinate all 20 000 undergraduate students following an outbreak of meningitis. This is something that UMass trains for each year, but hasn't had to do in a real-world situation since the 2009 outbreak of Swine Flu.

Meningitis is a potentially deadly bacterial infection. There are 2 confirmed cases at UMass and more may be carrying the bacteria. "This bacteria exists as a carrier state mostly and it occasionally causes disease," explained Dr. George Corey, the Executive Director of UMass University Health Services. "So for every case there could be many carriers who will never become ill."

CDC testing shows the 2 sick students, who did not know each other, had the same genetic virus, which suggests that others who don't show symptoms may have the bacteria dormant in their body. That's why UMass is holding their 1st of 4 mass vaccination clinics [Thu 30 Nov 2017] inside the Student Union.

"There's a good chance or a worrisome chance that someone else could get ill," said UMass Public Health Nurse Ann Becker. "The illness is severe enough that we really don't see any of our students get this, not one, one more is too many." Becker recommends students avoid sharing food, drinks, and close contact, and to wash your hands. "I am certainly worried. I've been paying attention to e-mails," said UMass undergraduate student [MW]. "I personally have not gotten the shot but a lot of my friends have so I think it's in everyone's minds across campus."

UMass wants you to know this vaccine is different than the meningitis vaccine you were required to get before you enrolled. UMass will bill your insurance, so there should be no out of pocket cost. So far, UMass has vaccinated 1500 students. Faculty and staff are not considered at risk.

As for the 2 students who already have meningitis, UMass health officials would only say they are getting positive updates.

[A primary case is one that occurs in the absence of previous known close contact with another case-patient.

An outbreak is defined by the occurrence of at least 3 confirmed or probable primary cases of the same serogroup meningococcal disease during a period of 3 months or less, with a resulting primary attack rate of 10 or more cases per 100 000 population. Two primary cases caused by serogroup B in 21 000 UMass Amherst undergraduates gives a primary attack rate of 9.5 / 100 000.

In some instances the attack rate will be greater than 10 cases per 100 000 population with only 2 cases. In these situations, vaccination may be considered after only 2 primary cases are identified (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6202a3.htm). For outbreaks caused by serogroup B, the CDC recommends vaccination with a serogroup B meningococcal vaccine for anyone 10 years or older identified as being at increased risk.

Outbreaks of meningococcal disease are usually caused by the same or closely related strains. Molecular genotyping will help characterize an outbreak clone. - Mod.ML
