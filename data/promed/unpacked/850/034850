PASTEURELLA PNEUMONIA, BIG HORN SHEEP - USA (3)
===============================================

Subject: Re: bighorn sheep

This is a concern here in Idaho too. Some of the affected populations
straddle the border with neighboring states to the west. I'm sure you'll
be getting replies from informed academics and wildlife biologists.
Hope you hear from Idaho Fish & Game, Washington State Univ.-Pullman
Veterinary School, U. Idaho (Moscow) Wildlife Resources. U.S Fish &
Wildlife may be involved as well.

>From my understanding the bighorn "plague" has been targeted for more
than a year, the bacterium has been identified, and there is a program
underway to inoculate individuals against the resulting pneumonias.
Prognosis not rosy, however.

There have been several reports on the affected sheep and efforts to help
them produced by Idaho Public Television.
