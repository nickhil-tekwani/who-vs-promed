Defense ministry spokesman Christos Pieris on Monday [26 Jul 2021] confirmed that 30 new army recruits suffered food poisoning after a meal at the Larnaca camp where they had registered but called it an isolated incident. The incident took place on Saturday [24 Jul 2021] after the recruits were served a meal of pork with potatoes and sauce, provided by the catering company hired by the ministry.

Speaking to CyBC, Pieris said that even though around 30 soldiers had stomach trouble after the meal, they were looked after, and nobody needed to go to hospital. "It was an isolated incident, we're not worried," he said, adding that the specific catering company has been providing meals for the army for the past 3 years, with no other reported incidents.

[The incubation from the ingestion of the alleged food to the beginning of symptoms and the symptoms present (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, presence or absence of fever) can be very useful in assessing the cause of the outbreaks.

"Larnaca, also known as Zenon, is a city on the southern coast of Cyprus and the capital of the Larnaca District. It is the third-largest city in the country, after Nicosia and Limassol" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larnaca). - Mod.LL
