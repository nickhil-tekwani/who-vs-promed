Dear Sir,

Reference is made to the ProMED article of 24 July 2012 on "new insecticidal house paint for vector control" and the query of the moderator of ProMED to WHO on the same subject.

The World Health Organization Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) is an international programme that coordinates independent testing and evaluation of pesticides for use in public health. The recommendations of the Scheme are intended to facilitate the registration and use of evaluated pesticide products by WHO Member States. The regulatory approval of pesticide products is, however, the sole prerogative of national authorities.

Evaluation of a pesticide product by WHOPES can only be initiated when the manufacturer has demonstrated the epidemiological impact of a new pesticide-based control intervention ("proof of principle").

In so far as WHO is aware, no proof of the impact of Inesfly on the transmission of vector-borne diseases (e.g. Chagas disease and malaria) has as yet been established.

WHOPES only initiates field testing and evaluation of a pesticide product once the manufacturer provides data which establish its safety for the intended application. To date, the manufacturer of Inesfly has not provided WHOPES with any such safety data.

According to published information, the Inesfly 5A IGR is a mixture of chlorpyriphos 1.5%, diazinon 1.5% and pyriproxyfen 0.063%. Its safety assessment is essential to ensure that it does not cause undue hazard to the applicators and residents of the houses to which it is applied.

Inesba, the manufacturer of Inesfly, approached WHO in 2010 with a request for WHOPES evaluation of its insecticidal paint. WHO informed the company that as a prerequisite, the company would have to establish the proof of principle, and generate the necessary data to support the safety of its product.

The requested information is awaited, but has yet to be supplied.
