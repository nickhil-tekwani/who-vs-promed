The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control [NCDC] has described the shortfall of cholera vaccines as one of its greatest challenges in the fight to control the recent surge in the number of disease cases. This is even as it expressed sadness that the death toll from suspected cases of cholera rose by 61% in the past 3 weeks.

A report contained on the NCDC website, accessed by Saturday PUNCH in Abuja on Friday [23 Jul 2021], noted, among other things, that the shortage of vaccines was affecting intervention efforts in most local government areas, wards and settlements with reported cases of the outbreak. It identified the lack of portable water especially in some rural areas and urban slums, open defecation in affected communities, inadequate health facility infrastructure and cholera commodities for management of patients as part of the problem.

Findings by Saturday PUNCH revealed that as of 21 Jul 2021, the cholera death toll in Nigeria increased by 61% within a 3-week period bringing the total number of deaths from 325 to 521, with states like Kaduna, Jigawa, Bauchi and the Federal Capital Territory [FCT] accounting for most of the fatalities. These figures were contained in data collated from state ministries of health and the NCDC.

The NCDC had on 27 Jun 2021 published a cholera situation report on its website where it was stated that no fewer than 16 states of the federation reported 14 343 suspected cases with 325 deaths recorded. According to the report, some of the states include Bayelsa, Benue, Kogi, Sokoto, Gombe, Delta, Cross River, Kebbi, Nasarawa, Plateau, Bauchi, Kaduna, Zamfara, Kano, Niger and the FCT. Further findings, however, revealed that states like Enugu, Yobe and Jigawa joined the lists of states that recorded new deaths with 14, 4 and 30 deaths, respectively.

The Federal Capital Territory reported the highest spike in the number of deaths, as the death toll increased from 2 to 60 in just 3 weeks; Kaduna moved from 5 to 33 deaths, while Jigawa reported a fresh death toll of 30. Bayelsa reported 25 deaths, Benue, 12; Kogi, 4; Sokoto, 86; Gombe, 1; Kebbi, 1; Nasarawa 17; Plateau, 21; Bauchi, 42; Kano, 119; Niger, 10.

The NCDC, however, stated that it would continue to "scale up risk communication, build capacity for sample collection, transportation and laboratory diagnosis." The centre also said it would "develop and submit cholera vaccination requests to international coordinating groups for reactive cholera campaigns; continue advocacy to the state government to increase funding in wash infrastructure."

Experts have warned that the rising cholera cases around the country must be treated as a national emergency, especially following the devastating cholera outbreak in 2010 that claimed hundreds of lives in the country.

"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2- or 3-dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80% for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.

"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:
- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;
- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65% (95% CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;
- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).

"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single-dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single-dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products, which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63,64)."
