--------------------------------------
The above post cited a local media report of 11 Nov 2016, describing mortality in cattle showing clinical signs of "ulceration at mouth and foot regions, together with diarrhea which, reportedly, had been observed since 2 Sep 2016. About 80 animals would have died in 8 villages (i.e. Naungvat, Nantyein, Naunghan, Lonelan, Naungsai, Lonewai, Mangpai) in a 16-mile area around Kutkai township, Eastern Shan State http://www.thithtoolwin.com/2016/11/blog-post_260.html.

On 15 Nov 2016, we have become aware of information from a reliable professional saying that no disease was observed in the named area and that rumors of disease could have referred to hemorrhagic septicemia (HS) outbreaks that occurred in the area between August and September 2016.

A confirmation from official sources will help.
