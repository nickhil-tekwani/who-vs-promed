Authorities in eastern China announced a ban Tuesday [28 Jan 2014] on live poultry sales following an increase in the number of people infected with the H7N9 strain of bird flu, with the busy Chinese New Year travel period already underway.

So far this year [2014], the virus has killed 20 people in China out of 96 known infections, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. The deaths were in eastern Shanghai, neighboring Zhejiang province, and southern Guangdong province. A week ago, more than 50 cases had been reported. The virus remains hard to catch, and most cases have been linked to contact with poultry.

The jump in cases comes during the 40-day travel period around Chinese New Year, a period that concerns health authorities because of the volume of people traveling in crowded trains and buses, often with live chickens aboard. Chinese are expected to make 3.6 billion trips as families reunite. The holiday, which officially starts Friday [31 Jan 2014], also falls during the winter months when flu typically rages.

On Tuesday [28 Jan 2014], Hong Kong authorities culled 20 000 birds, mostly chickens, at a wholesale market after poultry from Guangdong tested positive for the H7N9 virus, the 1st time it had been found in imported poultry in Hong Kong [see: ProMED-mail post: Avian influenza, human (39): China (HK) H7N9, contact surveillance 20140128.2238016]. They put the birds into black plastic bags and pumped in carbon dioxide to suffocate them, and closed the market for 3 weeks.

Live poultry trading will be halted in cities in coastal Zhejiang province from 15 Feb 2014, where 49 people have been infected, and 12 people have died this year [2014], according to the Zhejiang Daily, which is run by the province's propaganda department. From July [January? 2014], city poultry markets will be closed. Neighboring Shanghai will halt live poultry trading for 3 months starting Friday [31 Jan 2014]. The city has reported 8 infections and 4 deaths this year.

The World Health Organization says there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission but has recommended close monitoring given the holiday travel and the potentially unpredictable behavior of flu viruses.
