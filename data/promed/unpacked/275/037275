Indonesia: Update on the Cikelet Outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
In one week, avian flu struck communities in 2 villages at Garut, West
Java, causing 5 suspected bird flu deaths. Three of the 5 victims were
buried before laboratory samples were taken. Laboratory tests on the other
2 victims confirmed they were positive for bird flu. The latest case raised
anxiety among the people living near the victims' residences; hundreds of
chickens nearby were found dead.
The villages are isolated in remote areas (130 km southeast of Bandung, the
capital city of West Java), and residents can only travel by motorcycle or
4-wheel drive vehicles, so news traveled slowly, and the case was handled
too late. There were further delays, because officials and citizens were
still celebrating Independence Day. Nevertheless, officials moved quickly
and slaughtered the chickens. People were asked to hand over their poultry
as soon as possible to stop the spread of bird flu, because officials had
difficulty in identifying where the viruses came from.
The victims ranged from 9 to 35 years old and had received medical
treatment in the sub-district's medical center, a local hospital, and the
Hasan Sadikin Hospital in Bandung, which was recommended for handling bird
flu cases. The latest case brings the total number of avian flu cases in
this province [including/excluding the Cikelet cases?] to 20 people
positive for bird flu and 17 among them dead.
Meanwhile, 12 survivors are still receiving medical treatment in Hasan
Sadikin Hospital and Slamet Hospital in Garut regency, except a 17-year-old
whose family insisted on bringing him home despite his illness. A pregnant
woman, 35, is in the hospital suffering from pneumonia. Medical staff are
not sure whether the virus has infected the baby.
Two young children who received medical treatment in Hasan Sadikin Hospital
were found negative for bird flu after preliminary tests were taken.
Doctors are still not willing to ignore such symptoms, as their residences
were in the same village as a victim. The children are still under
observation at the hospital in an isolated room while waiting for more tests.
To avoid more infections, Health Ministry officials have distributed more
than 20 000 doses of the drug Tamiflu (Oseltamivir) to people near villages
where dead chickens were found. The distribution is also aimed at
increasing public awareness of bird flu, with an emphasis on elementary
school children.
Health officials repeatedly said the Garut case was not a cluster infection
like in Tanah Karo, North Sumatra, and insisted that there is no indication
yet that bird flu could be spreading from people to people like common
influenza.

[2] Indonesia - Suspected Case in North Sumatra

Indonesia: Suspected Avian Influenza Case in North Sumatra
-----------------------------------------------
An avian influenza suspect, 35 years old, a resident of Silima Kuta
subdistrict, Simalungun district, North Sumatra, is still being intensively
treated at H. Adam Malik Hospital in Medan.
A member of the Avian Influenza Prevention Team at H. Adam Malik Hospital,
Prof. dr. H. Luhur Soeroso said here on Wednesday [23 Aug 2006] that the
patient is now being treated in an isolation room of the state hospital.
The patient was admitted to the hospital on Tuesday [22 Aug 2006] at about
3 pm due to high fever reaching 39.6 C and blood pressure with a
systolic/diastolic reading of 110/80.
Earlier, the local husbandry office found dead poultry near the patient's
house, and the office claimed that the poultry was positively affected by
avian influenza virus.
Soeroso pointed out that his team has taken samples including blood of the
patient to be sent to the Health Ministry's laboratory in Jakarta. "We are
now still looking forward to the result of laboratory [tests regarding the
condition of the avian influenza suspect]," he said. Soeroso pointed out
that every bird flu suspect at H. Adam Malik Hospital was treated as
quickly as possible, because it was a reference hospital for bird flu cases
in North Sumatra province.

[3] Viet Nam - Possibility of false negatives

Viet Nam: Possibility of False Negative Tests
-----------------------------------------------
Avian influenza cases may go undetected in patients who took antiviral
drugs days before being tested because treating the virus may mask
infection, said virologist Menno de Jong, whose team observed 18 cases in
Viet Nam. Specimens should be collected from suspected cases before or soon
after medicines such as Oseltamivir are administered, said de Jong, Head of
Virology at an Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City.
Nasal and throat swabs from Vietnamese patients who responded well to
Oseltamivir, marketed by Roche Holding AG as Tamiflu, were unable to detect
the virus 48-to-72 hours after beginning treatment, he said. "If a patient
is on Oseltamivir for 3 days before the 1st swab is taken for diagnostic
testing, it's possible the result will be negative, but the patient could
be infected" with the H5N1 strain of avian influenza, de Jong said in a
telephone interview yesterday [21 Aug 2006].
Since 2003, H5N1 is known to have infected 240 people in 10 countries,
killing 141 of them, the World Health Organization said yesterday [21 Aug
2006]. Almost all human H5N1 cases have been linked to close contact with
sick or dead birds, such as children playing with them or adults butchering
them or plucking feathers, according to the Geneva-based agency. Early
detection and isolation of suspected cases are important to limit the
spread of the virus should it begin to spread easily between people, the
WHO said last year [2005] in a recommendation of strategic actions to fight
a pandemic.
The most recent H5N1 cases occurred this month [August 2006] in a remote
village in the Garut district of Indonesia's West Java province. No
evidence of human-to-human transmission has been found, Health Minister
Siti Fadilah Supari told reporters in the capital, Jakarta, today [22 Aug
2006]. Authorities distributed Tamiflu to about 2100 villagers in Garut,
the Jakarta Post reported today, citing Fatimah Resmiati, a spokeswoman
from the ministry's West Java environmental health office. Indonesia, the
world's 4th-most-populous country, accounts for 1/3rd of the 141 known H5N1
fatalities since 2003.
Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is recommended by the WHO as the 1st choice for
doctors treating human H5N1 cases. In patients with confirmed or strongly
suspected H5N1 infection, doctors should administer the drug as soon as
possible, according to agency guidelines.
The efficacy of Oseltamivir and other antiviral drugs that work by
preventing the virus from spreading from infected cells to other cells in
the body "depends on their administration within 48 hours of onset of
symptoms," the WHO said. Diagnostic swabs done 2 days or more after the
start of treatment may "reduce the possibility of detecting the virus,"
virologist de Jong said. "Taking a swab takes about 10 seconds. That's not
a big delay."
In Thailand, laboratory test results are pending on 100 patients under
surveillance for possible H5N1, the Bureau of General Communicable Diseases
in Bangkok said yesterday [21 Aug 2006]. The country's 1st H5N1 case this
year [2006] was missed for 9 days, partly because the virus wasn't
initially found in samples collected from the 17-year-old patient, and his
symptoms were mistaken for dengue fever. The H5N1 virus hadn't been ruled
out because a week before his illness, the teenager had buried 10 dead
chickens, touching the carcasses with his bare hands, the bureau said.
False-negative results may have been caused by the patient's treatment with
Oseltamivir, said Anucha Apisarnthanarak, an infectious disease specialist
and epidemiologist at the Thammasart University Hospital in Bangkok.
False-negatives can also occur because replication of the virus in these
parts of the upper respiratory system may be low at the time the patient
was tested, he said. A study of H5N1 cases in Viet Nam, published in the 29
Sep 2005 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, found the virus's
genetic material couldn't be detected in throat-swab samples until between
2 and 15 days after the patient began feeling ill. The median interval from
the onset of illness to the detection of viral RNA was 5.5 days, a
consultative committee to the WHO wrote in the study.
