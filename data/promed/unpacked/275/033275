South African CJD Patient: Diagnosis Confirmed as Iatrogenic CJD, NOT vCJD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A 27-year-old South African man contracted classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
(CJD) after having an operation to graft imported human tissue, a government
official said on Mon 24 Jun 2002. "The source of his sickness comes from
human tissue that was imported from another country," Zola Pinda, an
assistant director in the Department of
Agriculture, said. "It has nothing to do with South African livestock."
[see: CJD, iatrogenic dura mater graft - South Africa: susp 20020623.4576].
The man, who is critically ill, initially tested positive for new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease [abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in
ProMED-mail], which scientists suspect is linked to eating meat infected
with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease. "Based on
the clinical grounds and other tests that have been done, the diagnosis in
the Uitenhage patient is that of classical CJD and not vCJD," Health
Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang said last week. Scientists say that in
most cases of classic CJD, the cause is unknown. About 10-15 percent of the
cases have a genetic origin and about 1 percent are contracted through
medical procedures [iatrogenic CJD -- as in this case].
The man slipped into a coma on Fri 22 Jun 2002 after being admitted to a
clinic in Uitenhage in Eastern Cape province. He was in critical condition
late on Sun 23 Jun 2002, but the clinic was not available to comment on his
condition on Monday. A government source said the man had undergone a brain
operation in which an imported human membrane [dura mater] was used. "It was
not an ingested infection and was diagnosed after the brain procedure, which
took place more than 2 years ago," the source said.
South Africa has had no reported cases of BSE or vCJD, according to the
Department of Agriculture.
