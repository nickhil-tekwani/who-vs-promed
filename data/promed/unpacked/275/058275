Chief Veterinary Officer G. Murray, Canberra, has notified the OIE that
Japanese encephalitis [JE has been identified in the Torres Strait and in
Cape York (northernmost part of Queensland.
"There have been two human cases of the disease this year. The first was in
a 12-year-old unvaccinated child on Badu island in the Torres Strait, on 13
March 1998. The second case was confirmed in a professional fisherman, at
the mouth of the Mitchell River, western Cape York Peninsula, on 24 March
1998. Both patients have recovered.
Affected animals: Blood samples have been collected from sentinel pigs in
the Torres Strait and the northern area of Cape York Peninsula. Samples
have also been harvested from domesticated and shot wild pigs in the
Mitchell River area.
Laboratory confirmation: Attempts are being made to isolate virus from
sentinel animals in order to confirm the presence of JE virus on the
mainland, including the mouth of the Mitchell River where the second human
case occurred.
Torres Strait islands with positive sentinel pigs are Saibai, Badu, Moa and
Mabuiag. Subsequent surveys of pigs present on Stephens, Darnley, Hammond
and Prince of Wales Islands have shown evidence of infection.
On the mainland, seroconversions have occurred in some sentinel pigs
located in the Bamaga area, in the Northern Peninsula Area. Seropositive
animals have also been detected in one herd of domesticated wild pigs
surveyed in the Mitchell River area on remote western Cape York.
Diagnostic techniques used have included haemagglutination- inhibition,
serum neutralisation and polymerase chain reaction.
Comment: Human and animal health authorities in Queensland are currently
cooperating to enhance surveillance programmes to determine the extent of
the virus incursion. Under Australia's monitoring strategy, sentinel pigs
have been surveyed this summer, across the northern coastline."
