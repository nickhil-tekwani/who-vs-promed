[1] USA (Georgia): sleepaway camp outbreak
Date: Fri 31 Jul 2020
Source: AJC (Atlanta Journal-Constitution) [edited]
https://www.ajc.com/news/coronavirus/260-coronavirus-cases-tied-to-north-georgia-camp-outbreak/NZDPEZRRUNHT7CVE43JOPUAVSY/


Some 260 cases of the coronavirus have been tied to attendees and staff at a North Georgia YMCA children's camp in June [2020], according to a report released Friday [31 Jul 2020] by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one of the largest known superspreading events in the state. The report details how COVID-19 spread rapidly among children and teens within the camp and raises questions about the effectiveness of safety protocols as school districts and colleges contemplate reopening for in-person instruction this fall.

YMCA Camp High Harbour, identified in the report as Camp A, suffered an outbreak at its Lake Burton location in late June [2020]. As of [10 Jul 2020], about 85 cases of the virus had been linked to the camp, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution previously reported, a figure that has since tripled.

The CDC study of 597 campers and staff from Georgia found the camp did not follow its guidance to require campers to wear masks, though staff did. 3/4 of the 344 attendees and staff for whom the CDC was able to obtain test results tested positive for the virus. The CDC said the overall attack rate of the virus was 44%, though the agency acknowledged that's an undercount because it includes more than 250 for whom they had no results.

"This investigation adds to the body of evidence demonstrating that children of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and, contrary to early reports might play an important role in transmission," the report said.

Brian Castrucci, CEO of the de Beaumont Foundation, a Maryland nonprofit that assists public health agencies and a former epidemiologist in Georgia, said the report is a warning for local school districts and others about the potential for spread in congregant settings. "This should show you how actively kids can transmit it," he said. "If you have a low prevalence in your community, you can start to do things. If you have rampant and rapid community spread, then there is no opening schools, there is no opening colleges. It is not going to work."

Gov. Brian Kemp initially allowed day camps to open for the summer as part of the state's broader reopening plan. An executive order in May [2020] later allowed overnight camps to operate but outlined health and hygiene guidelines, including temperature checks and a requirement for campers and staff to have a negative COVID-19 test within 12 days of the start of camp. Though many camps opted not to open, some, including High Harbour, did.

Dr Harry J Heiman, clinical associate professor at the Georgia State University School of Public Health, said spread of the virus was growing in June [2020], presenting a high likelihood the virus would spread in a camp setting. "We know that congregate settings, particularly indoor congregant settings, are among the highest risks," he said.

High Harbour followed the governor's executive order, the federal report said, but the camp did not follow CDC recommendations for universal masking of campers or for increased ventilation in buildings. Staff were required to wear masks, the report said. "Relatively large cohorts sleeping in the same cabin and engaging in regular singing and cheering likely contributed to transmission," the CDC said. "Use of cloth masks, which has been shown to reduce the risk for infection, was not universal."

The CDC said its investigation is ongoing and will attempt to identify specific sources of exposure, the course of the illness, and "any secondary transmission to household members." "Physical distancing and consistent and correct use of cloth masks should be emphasized as important strategies for mitigating transmission in congregate settings," the report said.

Statement of regret
-------------------
The YMCA did not make anyone available for an interview. In a written statement, Parrish Underwood, chief advancement officer for the YMCA of Metro Atlanta, said the organization now regretted holding the camp. "We made every effort to adhere to best practices outlined by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the American Camp Association," and the governor, Underwood said. "Attending Camp High Harbour is a tradition numerous generations of Y families look forward to every summer," Underwood's statement said. "Many of these individuals reached out to our staff to express their desire for us to open our residential camps in an effort to create normalcy in their children's lives due to the detrimental impact of COVID-19. This weighed heavily in our decision to open, a decision in retrospect we regret."

The YMCA said it notified parents that a counselor tested positive for COVID-19 on [24 Jun 2020]. The camp told parents they could pick up their children early. The YMCA closed its Lake Burton and Lake Allatoona locations. The YMCA said the counselor passed required health screenings, as did all other campers and staff.

The CDC study offered some caveats to the infection rates. Georgia suffered high rates of spread at the end of June, [2020] and some of the infections might have occurred prior to or after the camp. Information about the conditions of infected campers and staff also was limited, and the report did not detail the severity of infections. But the report said of the 136 cases with symptom data, about 1/4 reported no symptoms. Of the 3/4 reporting symptoms, fever, headache, and sore throat were the most common.

The median age of campers was 12 and staffers was 17. There were 7 staffers between the ages of 22 and 59. 51 kids, or roughly 1/2, of the children aged 6 to 10 tested positive. About 44% of children aged 11 to 17 tested positive and 1/3 of the remaining people from 18 to 59 tested positive, the report said.

Cases of COVID-19 tend to be milder for children and young adults than for the elderly, but the disease isn't without risk. There have been 12 290 confirmed cases among children 5 to 17 in Georgia, with 165 hospitalizations and one death, an analysis of state data shows. To date, 186 352 people in Georgia have tested positive for the coronavirus, including about 4000 announced Friday [31 Jul 2020]. There have been 3752 deaths, including 81 reported on Friday [31 Jul 2020].

Georgia in the 'red zone'
-------------------------
Knowledge of transmission between children and adults is not well understood, but health experts have told the AJC they fear infections in children and adults can easily spread to more vulnerable people. Though people over 60 make up the largest cohorts of hospitalizations and deaths, a recent Emory University study said children and adults under 60 are much more likely than the elderly to spread the disease to others.

Some schools are pushing forward with August [2020] opening plans, while allowing home instruction or blended in-person and distance learning. Other systems, including Atlanta Public Schools, announced plans to delay the start of the school year and to begin instruction online amid substantial community spread of the virus.

On [24 Jul 2020], the CDC published guidance endorsing the full reopening of schools, citing risks to children's health and education that could be inflicted by not having schools open for in-person instruction. That guidance came after pressure from President Trump, who has called for full reopening of schools. The CDC guidance called for keeping students in small groups, staffed by a single teacher, and to use outdoor spaces for learning. The guidance includes recommendations for masking and other hygiene protocols and plans for when a student contracts the virus.

But many independent public health experts, while acknowledging the importance of in-school instruction, have been critical of the new CDC guidance. Heiman, the Georgia State professor, said schools often have poor ventilation. Reopening for in-person instruction endangers students and their family members and school staff.

Georgia is one of 21 states outlined in a White House task force report in the "red zone" for coronavirus spread. That report has recommended the state mandate masks and close bars, nightclubs, entertainment venues, and put stricter limits on indoor dining and groups. Kemp has so far decided not to mandate masks, though he has encouraged face coverings. He also has balked at new restrictions on the movement of business and people.

A group of more than 2000 medical professionals have called on Kemp to implement the White House task force's recommendations and to allow local jurisdictions to enact stricter measures. "Many of us have said all along that unless we can get the level of COVID-19 down in communities, it is not safe to open schools and colleges," Heiman said. "This (report) certainly reinforces that."

[The original report of this outbreak is worth reading in detail; it can be found at Szablewski CM, Chang KT, Brown MM, et al. SARS-CoV-2 transmission and infection among attendees of an overnight camp -- Georgia, June 2020. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 31 Jul 2020; https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6931e1.htm.

This outbreak should definitely serve as an alert that children can and do get sick when infected with the SARS-CoV-2, and are active transmitters of the virus (I highly doubt the counselor infected all of the children. There is mention that the Georgia Executive order for opening of camps mandated "all trainees, staff members, and campers to provide documentation of a negative viral SARS-CoV-2 test 12 days or less before arriving." This does not take into account the accepted incubation period (14 days), nor does it factor in the false negative rate of the current nucleic acid and antigen testing done.

Additional information not available at present is the secondary attack rate in the children's families upon return home from camp, including parents, siblings, and others such as grandparents and aunts and uncles. That will increase the infected pool of individuals associated with this outbreak, and start including older-aged individuals with potentially higher risk of complications. It certainly adds to the concerns of re-opening schools in locations with active virus transmission ongoing.

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences. Spain has been added again, as it is dealing with a 2nd wave after lifting of restrictions, primarily focused in Catalonia and Aragon. - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update: [Please note that once again there is weekend reporting artifact as some key countries vis-à-vis, ongoing transmission are not reporting over the weekend. Hence, "major changes", if observed, should take this into account before drawing conclusions. - Mod.MPP]

- The Americas region reported 59.5% of the global newly reported cases and 67.7% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 9.4 million cases. The USA reported 43.1% of cases (67 499), followed by Brazil 33.5% (52 383), Colombia 6.1% (9488), Mexico 5.4% (8458), (Peru 0% (0)), Argentina 3.8% (5929), and Chile 1.3% (1991).

- The European region reported 6.6% of the global newly reported cases and 5.5% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 31.2% (5427) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by (Spain 0% (0)), Kazakhstan 7.0% (1226), Israel 0% (0)), Romania 7.0% (1225), (France 0% (0)), Ukraine 6.4% (1112), Turkey 5.7% (996), the UK 4.4% (771), Uzbekistan 4.2% (736), Poland 3.8% (658), Switzerland 2.7% (479), Bosnia and Herzegovina 2.5 (433), and Kyrgyzstan 2.4% (420). While the proportion of cases represented by Russia is continuing to drop, the absolute numbers of cases are relatively stable in keeping with the increase in activity in Eastern European countries. Spain and France while having renewed increased transmission have not reported cases today, and Eastern Europe remains active.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 3.4% of the global newly reported cases and 6.3% of global newly reported fatalities. Iran reported 28.1% (2548), of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iraq 23.1% (2095), Saudi Arabia 17.3% (1573), (Pakistan 0% (0)), Morocco 8.0% (729), Kuwait 5.4% (491), (Oman 0% (0)), Palestinian Authority 3.6% (323), UAE 2.8% (254), Egypt 2.6% (238), Qatar 2.4% (216), and Bahrain 2.3% (208). Pakistan and Oman did not report their case numbers in the last 24 hours, although the Worldometer data available on the link in the next section shows 1393 cases for Pakistan, while the number of cases from Oman is not available. Pakistan is decreasing its daily case count steadily during the month of July 2020 (on 1 Jul 2020, Pakistan reported 4133 newly confirmed cases), while at the same time cases are increasing in Iraq, Oman and Morocco. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a surge mode.

- The African region reported 5.5% of the global newly reported cases and 4.0% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 70.5% (10 107) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by (Equatorial Guinea 0% (0)), Kenya 5.1% (727), Algeria 3.9% (556), Ethiopia 3.3% (469), Madagascar 2.8% (405), Nigeria 2.7% (386), and Ghana 0% (0). Kenya is fairly active in the region, although South Africa is the dominant country in the region, with daily reports of more than 10 000 cases..

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.5% of the global newly reported cases and 0.46% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 72.9% (4878) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 12.7% (853), Australia 5.6% (377), Singapore 4.6% (307), China 2.7% (180), Viet Nam 0.48% (32), and South Korea 0.45% (30). Japan continues experiencing an increase in transmission.

- The South East Asia region reported 22.4% of the global newly reported cases and 16.0% of global deaths. India reported 92.8% (54 735) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 3.7% (2199) and Indonesia 2.6% (1560). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions.

[Comparing today's numbers with yesterday's (1 Aug 2020), the global case count rose by 1.2% in the past 24 hours (weekend reporting artifact contributes to this apparent decrease in daily case count). The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts, although India has been rapidly increasing, with a daily case count today [2 Aug 2020] approaching 53 000.

In the past 24 hours, India reported 52 783 cases followed by the USA (49 329) and Brazil (24 801) -- significant reductions in daily case reports by the USA and Brazil. These 3 countries account for half of all confirmed cases globally (51.3%). There were 4011 deaths reported in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by the USA, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, South Africa, Russia, Argentina, the Philippines, and Mexico, all known global hotspots - the same 10 countries as yesterday (1 Aug 2020) just differing order. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 4853 to 52 783. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Iran, Iraq, Chile, Indonesia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Romania, and Panama, and their range of reported new cases is 1070 to 2685. This is the 1st appearance of Panama on this list. Note that Spain has previously been on the list but hasn't reported cases in the past 2 days.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 2.6%, and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is decreased by 5.9%. The key question arises as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or is this a reporting artifact? Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances.

Impression: Interpretation of major changes should keep in mind reporting artifact over the weekend. The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases. That being said, the most severely affected region is the Americas with cases increasing on a daily basis, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.MPP]
