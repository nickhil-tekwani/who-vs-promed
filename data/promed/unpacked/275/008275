All forest department officials of Pench Tiger Reserve, who were quarantined after the death of T-21 tiger, have completed their quarantine period and all are fit now. The tiger died on [4 Apr 2020] in Pench Tiger Reserve. National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had issued alert after tiger was found COVID-19 positive in US. Pench Tiger Reserve is spread in Seoni and Chhindwara districts in Madhya Pradesh.

The T-21 tiger died due to lungs infection and high fever. Antibiotics were administered to the tiger but it did not improve and ultimately it died on [4 Apr 2020]. The officials were in tension as the tiger was showing abnormal behavior so the entire team (14 members) were quarantined.

Director of Pench Tiger Reserve Vikram Singh said, "The entire team members were quarantined in forest after the death of T-21 tiger. Now their quarantine period is over and all are okay. Entry of visitors was totally banned in Pench Tiger Reserve after the death of the tiger. Our team was having close vigil on T-21 as it used to visit water reservoir and died at the reservoir. Post-mortem was conducted and the entire team sent on quarantine as preventive measure."

[Pench Tiger Reserve is a 293 sq km (113 sq mi) area in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. This area is considered one of the critical tiger habitats remaining in central India, hosting a population of around 44 tigers.

According to this article, the deceased tiger has been confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive, and they attribute the cause of death to this infection. The occurrence of fever and lung lesions support his contention. However, a previous report (before tests confirmed the tiger was infected by SARS-CoV-2; https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/science/india-tigers-coronavirus.html) states that the cause of death might have been an impacted intestine arising from a giant hairball.

If histopathology and other tests run on the specimens taken during the post-mortem procedure finally confirm the tiger died from infection by SARS-CoV-2, this would be the 1st documented death due to this virus in a non-human mammal.

Another major implication is that COVID-19 might add to the list of threats faced by tigers and other big cats, which already struggle to thrive despite habitat fragmentation and degradation, climate change, poaching, and many other diseases. - Mod.PMB
