Baboon liver passes virus to man
----------------------------------------------
A man who received a baboon liver in an experimental transplant became
infected with a virus from the animal, revealing another obstacle in the way
of animal-to-human transplants, researchers said Wednesday.
The man, a 35-year-old HIV patient, died of his liver disease just over two
months after the transplant, which took place in 1992 amid great publicity.
But tests of his tissues in later years show he became infected with a virus
from the baboon whose organ he received, Marian Michaels of the University
of Pittsburgh said.
"This was the first time that a virus has actually been cultured from a
person who received an animal transplant," Michaels told a meeting of
infectious disease experts sponsored by the American Society for
Microbiology.
The patient was suffering from liver damage caused by the hepatitis B virus
and had had his spleen removed after a car accident a few years before, so
he was very ill.
He received the baboon liver in an experimental procedure. He was given a
full load of antibiotics, plus the antiviral drug ganciclovir. He and the
baboon were infected with a herpes virus known as cytomegalovirus (CMV).
Baboons are known to carry CMV -- about 98 percent of all animals in the
wild and in the laboratory are infected. It does them no harm.
But CMV, which also infects many humans, was believed to be
species-specific. That is, the strain that infects one species, such as
baboons, was not believed to be able to infect humans.
"I think it is quite concerning that an animal virus thought to be
species-specific could be transmitted," Michaels said.
The patient took ganciclovir [an antiviral drug for the first 18 days after
the transplant but stopped because of side effects. Samples taken 28 days
after the transplant showed he was clearly infected with the baboon's CMV.
He had been put back on the ganciclovir, and tests showed that the patient
was clear of the virus after 35 days. Michaels said it is possible the drug
killed the virus.
She said the finding strikes a blow to the idea that primates could be used
for animal-to-human transplants, although she described the case of a
25-year-old AIDS patient who got a bone marrow transplant from a baboon that
had been quarantined from birth and was thus free of CMV.
Michaels said it would be possible to raise animals in totally sterile
conditions for use in transplants, but doing so with primates would raise
ethical issues [apart from being incredibly expensive - Mod.JW.
Because of the risk of unknown infections, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have
put a moratorium on animal-to-human transplants.
Dr. John Fung of Pittsburgh earlier told the meeting that the need for
animal organs is dire. He said 20 000 to 30 000 people are waiting for
livers now in the United States alone. "That number will increase by 15 to
20 percent a year, while the number of (human organ) transplants available
will increase by 2 to 3 percent," he said. The government says least a
million people are infected with hepatitis C, which can lead to irreversible
liver damage [& thus require transplants.

[It was bound to happen. But the virus presumably was not transmitted to
the patientÂ´s contacts; have they been tested for antibody?
CMV is the commonest post-transplant infection in human-to-human
transplants, often without producing disease but in about 25% of cases
causing serious systemic effects. But in immunocompetent adults, CMV causes
either no apparent disease or symptoms similar to infectious mononucleosis
(fever, sore throat, swollen glands & spleen) - Mod.JW
