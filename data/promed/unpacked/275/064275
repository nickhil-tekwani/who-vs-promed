Trichinellosis, Argentina
-------------------------
An outbreak in the Buenos Aires municipality of Saladillo has prompted the
provincial delegation of the Ministry of Health to recommend that people
not buy homemade embutidos and cachinados [varieties of sausage] that lack
appropriate labeling by veterinary inspectors. A warning has been issued to
the population to seek medical attention if they develop symptoms of the
disease, such as edema, muscular aches and fever.
More than 80 cases (all with confirmed clinical diagnoses) have been
diagnosed in the municipalities of Saladillo, Roque Perez, Lanus, and
Banfield. Laboratory studies are awaited; none of the cases are serious.
The majority of cases bought the pork products on Road 63, linking
Saladillo and Las Flores, during the past Easter. The products lacked
official certification, and the local authorities are trying to identify
the retailers and clandestine butchers.
