The BC [British Columbia] Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) is alerting British Columbians to discard or return to the place of purchase any Little Qualicum Cheeseworks' Qualicum Spice cheese that they currently have at home. Products in the marketplace have a best before date up to and including 24 Apr 2019.

A total of 5 people in BC have been affected by an _Escherichia coli_ outbreak between August and October 2018. Qualicum Spice cheese samples were tested and found to be contaminated with _E. coli_. The investigation is ongoing to determine the source and extent of contamination.

Qualicum Spice is an unpasteurized cheese. It is distributed throughout BC and sold in grocery stores, farmers' markets, wineries, restaurants, and at the Little Qualicum Cheeseworks farmgate store. Little Qualicum Cheeseworks has voluntarily recalled the affected product. Little Qualicum Cheeseworks produces several other types of dairy products. No other products are being recalled at this time and consumers do not need to discard them.

People who become ill from _E. coli_ can have a wide range of symptoms. Some may have no symptoms and some may become seriously ill and be hospitalized. The following symptoms can appear within 1 to 10 days after infection:
- severe stomach cramps;
- diarrhea or bloody diarrhea;
- vomiting;
- headache; and
- little or no fever

If you have eaten this product but have no symptoms, there is no need to do anything. If you become ill after consuming this cheese:
- practice good hand washing with warm water and soap to prevent the spread of illness;
- drink lots of clear fluids to stay hydrated;
- anyone who has bloody diarrhea or is concerned about their symptoms should see a health care provider or call HealthLinkBC at 811;
- antibiotics and anti-diarrhea medications should not be used to treat this infection unless prescribed by your health care provider.

[Although not specifically stated, the link to unpasteurized cheese and the description of the symptoms make it clear that the pathogen here is a member of the enterohemorrhagic _E coli_ pathotype.

Unpasteurized dairy products remain a potential risk for a variety of pathogens including enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, either the prototypic serotype or one of the other serotypes. In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups of EHEC [enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_], it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from the prototypic O157 strain (1). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (2). As noted in the post, suspected cases of EHEC should not be treated with antimicrobials.

The following was extracted from Lutwick LI. Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections. In: Confronting emerging zoonoses: the One Health paradigm. Yamada A, Kahn LH, Kaplan B, Monath TP, Woodall J, Conti LA (editors). Tokyo, Japan: Springer, 2014, 77-112:

Risk factors for the subsequent development of HUS after EHEC include children less than 10 years of age, elevated white blood cell counts, persistent low platelet counts without reversal and the use of either antimicrobial agents or antimotility agents during the diarrhea stage before or after bloody diarrhea develops. Since fever is generally not part of the presentation but significant abdominal pain is, patients with diarrhea, significant abdominal pain and no fever should be considered to have EHEC infection, and antimicrobial or antimotility agents should be avoided. Additionally, certain strains -- for example, the so-called clade 8 and the chimeric organism _E. coli_ O104:H4 -- can be associated with a higher risk of HUS.

HUS itself is a thrombotic illness primarily caused by the effects of the EHEC produced Shiga toxin acting on the vascular endometrium of organs where the toxin's receptors are expressed, particularly the kidney and brain. The syndrome consists of the combination of prominent low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia), intravascular red blood cell destruction (hemolysis) and diminished kidney function that can require hemodialysis. Neurological involvement occurs mostly in those who develop renal failure and the central nervous system involvement portends much higher mortality. Indeed, most of the acute mortality relates to neurological disease. Most patients will recover, but some, perhaps 10 percent, remain with renal failure and require chronic hemodialysis.
