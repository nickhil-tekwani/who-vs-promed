While many myxozoans that affect fish are myxosporeans, _Tetracapsuloides_ is not. It is a malacosporean. As you are well aware, many people use proMED as their primary data resource, so it causes concern to see such an error.

[Special thanks to Dr. Petty for pointing out this mistake of mine. To shed some more light on the taxonomical details, here are some extracts from the scientific article "Diversity and systematics of the Malacosporea (Myxozoa)" by Tops S et al. Invertebrate Biology 124(4):285-295.
"The phylum Myxozoa is comprised of endoparasites of fish and invertebrates. For most of the time that they have been recognized, myxozoans have been classified as protists, but it is now clear that they represent highly degenerate metazoans."
"Malacosporeans [are myxozoans that] parasitize freshwater bryozoans (Bryozoa: Phylactolaemata; for illustrations go to https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Haeckel_Bryozoa.jpg/240px-Haeckel_Bryozoa.jpg) during at least part of their life cycle, but no complete life cycle is known. Two species have been described so far within this class: _Buddenbrockia plumatellae_ and _Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae_. The former can exist as vermiform and sac-like stages in bryozoan hosts. The latter, in addition to forming sac-like stages in bryozoans, is the causative agent of salmonid proliferative kidney disease (PKD)". - Mod.PMB
