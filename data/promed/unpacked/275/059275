The outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has killed 7 people in Iran so far, a senior official at the Iran Veterinary Organization announced on [Mon 30 Jul 2018]. Karim Amiri said CCHF has become a permanent disease in Iran, adding that according to the latest data received by the organization, 56 cases of the disease have been reported so far, 7 of which have led to the death of the victims.

He went on to say that during the current Iranian year (which began on [Wed 21 Mar 2018]), the number of deaths due to Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has increased compared to last year [2017]. Several people who died this year [2018] from the disease had already some other illnesses that led to the weakening of their immune systems, Karim added.

In 2015, the disease took the lives of 3 people in Iran. It has also had a presence in neighbouring Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), CCHF's mortality rate is about 30 percent and is endemic to Africa, the Balkans, and Ukraine, the Middle East, and Central Asia. CCHF was first detected in the Crimea in 1944 and then in the Congo in 1969.

[According to the report above, 56 cases have been reported so far from Iran, with 7 deaths. The increase in the number of fatal cases is higher during the current year (2018) as compared to previous years. Timely detection and management of the CCHF cases may also help in reducing the case fatality, while integrated vector management through coordinated activities of human, animal/vector control with a 'One Health' approach is warranted. - Mod.UBA
