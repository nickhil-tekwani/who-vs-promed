The Marion County Health Department has confirmed the 1st positive
case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) this year [2010]. It was
present in a horse in the northwest area of the county.

EEE is a mosquito-borne virus that can be transmitted to humans and
horses by the bite of an infected mosquito.

The Health Department advises the public to remain diligent in
mosquito protection efforts, including the "5 D's" for prevention:
- Dusk and dawn: avoid being outdoors when mosquitoes are most active
- dress: wear clothing that covers skin
- DEET: repellents containing DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide, or
N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) are recommended as are picaridin and
oil of lemon eucalyptus
- drainage: check homes to rid areas of standing water where
mosquitoes can lay eggs

For more information, call the department at 629-0137.

[Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is a mosquito virus that in horses
is very preventable with a vaccine. Several of the encephalitides are
combined into one vaccination. A vaccination includes West Nile
virus, Eastern and Western equine encephalitis and often tetanus.
Although the vaccine needs to be repeated in about 3 weeks for the
animal to develop complete immunity, it takes very little to protect
the horse. There are vaccinations available with different
combinations than those listed above. If a horse develops EEE, it is
not contagious to other horses or to humans. It is the mosquito that
transmits the virus.

The season for EEE is starting early this year. Horse owners, please
vaccinate your animals.

Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is transmitted to humans by
the bite of an infected mosquito. Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE)
is a rare illness in humans, and only a few cases are reported in the
United States each year. In those cases that do occur, they are
generally located in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast states (see map at
<http://www.cdc.gov/easternequineencephalitis/tech/epi.html#map>.)
Most persons infected with EEEV have no apparent illness. Severe
cases of EEE (involving encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain)
begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and
vomiting. The illness may then progress into disorientation,
seizures, or coma. EEE is one of the most severe mosquito-transmitted
diseases in the United States with approximately 33 percent mortality
and significant brain damage in most survivors. There is no specific
treatment for EEE; care is based on symptoms. You can reduce your
risk of being infected with EEEV by using insect repellent, wearing
protective clothing, and staying indoors while mosquitoes are most
active. If you think you or a family member may have EEE, it is
important to consult your healthcare provider for proper diagnosis.
