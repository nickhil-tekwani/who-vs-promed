The Radio Australia transcript posted to ProMED-mail [Dengue - Fiji (06)
980115005107 attributes comments to me that I have not made. At no stage
have I said that the "current mosquito eradication campaign in the country
is not effective". Any comments I have made publicly were general in
nature, along the lines that a spraying campaign is only partially
effective because it has no effect on the larval stages, and in practice
kills only a proportion of the adults. In the face of an epidemic, a
mosquito control program should include a rational use of adulticiding
(spraying) combined with comprehensive source reduction (destruction of
_Aedes_ breeding sites).
The Fiji Government has mounted an extensive progam to do just that. A
round of spraying has been completed in Suva/Nausori (Central) and Lautoka
(West). Spraying is planned for some other towns. Cleanup campaigns aimed
at reducing _Aedes_breeding sites are underway nationally, through
government and non-government sectors. Hospitals and health centres have
implemented standard [dengue fever protocols for triage, outpatient
management and inpatient management, with good results. The Fiji
government is to be commended for its efforts to respond to the present
outbreak.

[Ouch! ProMED-mail posts messages in good faith, assuming the message was
sent in good faith and that the source was correct. In this instance we
picked up a newspaper report which misquoted the very knowledgeable Tony
Stewart. This is awful. Tony deserves an apology from ProMED-mail and he
has gotten one. Problem is, the collaborators with whom he is working
might not take this lightly. We plead with them to understand that
newspapers often (yes, often) say what they will, without understanding,
without interest other than a "hot" story, or because of space and deadline
constraints. Whether the quotes or stories themselves are true seem to be
of secondary importance. In any event, we apologize not only to Tony but
to the Fijian Government for any embarrassments and for our amplifying an
erroneous story. It seems the dengue outbreak in Fiji is being handled
properly and with dispatch. - Mod.CHC
