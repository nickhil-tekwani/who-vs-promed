There were 9 new outbreaks in the UK today, bringing the total to 214
(including one in Northern. Ireland).
Latest confirmations are in the counties of Dumfries and Galloway (3),
County Durham (2), Cumbria (2), Cheshire and Wiltshire.
Cheshire is a new county to be infected. Infected sheep are believed to
have moved to the county from an infected market at Welshpool in mid-Wales.
An announcement is expected tomorrow that thousands (possibly hundreds of
thousands) of sheep will be destroyed as a result of a thousand or so
animals moved by 2 dealers in the period between first confirmation of FMD
in the UK on February 20th and the general movement ban on February 23rd.
Trading at livestock markets (e.g. Northampton on February 22nd) occurred
in this period.

Foreign vets learn from UK outbreak
----------------------------------
Throughout the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak, agriculture officials
have been keen to stress that the UK is not facing a shortage of vets in
its efforts to battle the disease. But chief vet Jim Scudamore has talked
of efforts to enlist vets in private practices and the arrival of vets from
abroad. As well as English-speaking nations like the US, Australia, Canada
and New Zealand, specialist vets are now coming from other EU countries to
help Britain fight the outbreak. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food (MAFF) said foreign expertise was important, but vets were also coming
to learn and to gain first-hand experience of FMD.
The tracking of tens of thousands of animals potentially involved in the
outbreak requires numerous phone calls and farm visits occupying a lot of
"vet hours." Vets are also restricted by rules saying once they have been
at a "dirty" farm, one where the disease has been discovered, they are not
able to investigate other "clean" farms for at least 5 days.
The UK veterinary profession that MAFF can draw on is very different from
the one that helped fight 1967's outbreak. Far fewer vets are livestock
specialists, with more now specializing in the "companion animal" sector -
dealing with horses and pets. A MAFF spokesman said the State Veterinary
Service normally numbered 1300 and had been augmented by at least 240 vets
from private practices and abroad.
But he insisted the arrival of vets from overseas was a 2-way process
based on long-standing agreements. He said: "There are lots of countries
that have not had an outbreak of FMD. It is very valuable to us and
valuable to those governments to have vets who can recognize the disease.
The US, [which hasn't had an outbreak since the 1930s, can have vets who
have seen the outbreak first-hand."
Jeff Gill, of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, said 62 non-EU vets
had already been registered to enable them to work on the outbreak.
Professor Mac Johnston of the Royal Veterinary College said many foreign
vets could look at improving contingency plans for their home countries on
their return. He said: "We feel strongly this is a wonderful educational
exercise in terms of the disease, the epidemiology, how to deal with [it
and where things go wrong." But he added: "If you look at 1967 we had
predominantly large animal vets practices - very few small animal
practices. Now it is much the other way around."
Francis Anthony, who was president of the British Veterinary Association
from 1992-1993 and now has a practice in Herefordshire, said the shortage
of manpower in the current crisis concerned the disposal of animals rather
than vets. Mr Anthony worked on the 1967 outbreak in Cheshire and insisted
that although there were many more vets then, there were also more animals
to deal with. "There is plenty of capacity out there and no shortage of
vets," he said. But he added: "Our livelihoods have been virtually wiped
away. A couple of years ago this practice got 10 farm calls a day now we
are lucky if we get 1or 2."

Thousands of private vets are refusing to join attempts to wipe out the
foot and mouth disease (FMD) epidemic because they say the Government is
"penny-pinching" on their fees. They claim they cannot afford to abandon
their practices, many of which deal with pets as well as farmed livestock,
because the GBP 160.17 a day is a third of what they need. Their rejection
came 24 hours after Jim Scudamore, the Chief Veterinary Officer, appealed
to Britain's 16 000 private vets for help to relieve a fatigued team of
more than 500 which has been fighting the epidemic for 3 weeks.
Many vets were furious MAFF pays more to independent valuers to calculate
the market worth of the culled animals - for calculating compensation for
farmers - than to vets who are expected to detect the disease in the first
place. Valuers are paid one per cent of the value of the animals and are
guaranteed a minimum fee of GBP 500 a day and a maximum of GBP 1500
depending on the size of the herd or flock.
Vets also complained licensed slaughter-men were earning more to kill
infected animals and those suspected of incubating the disease.
Slaughter-men are paid a basic of GBP 10 an hour - although local MAFF
offices have discretion to pay more. Under the emergency measures private
vets are being offered GBP 160.17 a day as designated temporary veterinary
inspectors. This is 40 per cent more than the usual rate for this job.
However, if they were designated as local veterinary officers they would
have to be paid GBP 57 an hour. On a nominal 8-hour day this would earn
them GBP 456. In reality vets are working far longer hours.
More than 200 private vets are helping about 250 Government veterinary
officers to tackle the epidemic. Another 50 overseas vets have also
volunteered to help, largely to benefit from the experience. Some are
already in place. [MAFF has an arrangement with the veterinarians from
other countries to pay their room and board and perhaps other payments. -
Mod.TG
A partner in a large veterinary practice said: "I have made 3 vets
available to the ministry. One is working more or less full-time and the
others part-time. It costs our practice about GBP 80 000 for each vet it
employs and the money being offered by MAFF is simply not enough to cover
our costs. They are penny-pinching. It is not appreciated if one of my vets
comes in contact with an animal infected with FMD he cannot set foot in the
practice again for 5 days. So we have vets out of action and that is
expensive. There are huge implications. Vets have businesses to run, they
should not be expected to work for nothing."
A MAFF spokesman said last night that payments were "under review" but
added higher fees would give private vets more money than the Government's
own staff vets. "This could cause problems," he added.

One of Britain's leading vets says the most likely cause of the FMD crisis
was infected meat imports being fed to UK pigs. Comments by Professor Mac
Johnston are backed by other vets who say the disease crisis highlights
problems in the meat supply chain.
The last outbreak of FMD in 1967 was eventually traced to an imported joint
of meat. [Actually, it was one joint out of a shipment of some 30 mutton
carcasses landed at Liverpool. - Mod.MHJ
FMD can be harbored in an animal's lymph nodes, which are trimmed from
imported carcasses after arrival and can end up in pig swill, said the
professor. He added: "The virus will not survive in meat for more than 2
weeks if it is healthy. But it can live in the lymph nodes, which filter
toxins from the bloodstream, for 4 months."
Recent problems in the domestic meat industry - such as BSE and an outbreak
of swine fever last year - had made imports more economically attractive,
he said. The professor said it was "worrying" that nobody had quantified
the scale of illegal imports of meat into the UK.
Prof Johnston suggested importing meat, especially from countries where FMD
was endemic, increased the risks of infection in this country.
Professor Philip Duffus of Bristol Veterinary School agreed pig swill was a
possible source of the infection. "I think we should stop feeding swill to
pigs and stop importing from countries with infection," he said. He said
the "virulent" virus in Britain was similar to one which affected South
Africa recently and was the same type 'O' strain as that which caused an
outbreak in Japan. The source of the outbreak would eventually be traced by
analyzing the molecular composition of the virus, Prof Duffus added.

Britain has been importing beef from Argentina, despite fears of an
outbreak of FMD last month in the world's fifth largest beef exporter, the
Agriculture Ministry confirmed yesterday. Although the outbreak was
confirmed by the Argentine authorities on Tuesday, the infection occurred
on 23 Feb 2001. The Ministry of Agriculture said Britain did not import
lamb or
pork from Argentina and beef had been allowed from areas away from the
suspected source of the outbreak.
A spokesman said: "Argentina is 20 times the size of Britain and it was
decided that it was safe to import beef from regionalized areas well away
from the suspected infection." The outbreak was unconnected to the ones in
Britain and France.
British farmers have blamed the importation of foreign meat products for
the outbreak of FMD in the UK. According to the Grain and Feed Trade
Association, there have been outbreaks of the disease in some 30 countries
during the last 2 years, including Argentina, Brazil and South Africa.
Other countries having had recent outbreaks are Bhutan, Colombia, Egypt,
Georgia, Greece, Iran, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Kuwait, Malawi,
Malaysia, Mauritania, Mongolia, Namibia, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Saudi
Arabia, Swaziland, Taiwan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uruguay, Zambia and
Zimbabwe. [Obviously until the necessary viral fingerprinting has been
carried out and published, claims against this or that country are
meaningless. - Mods.MHJ/TG
