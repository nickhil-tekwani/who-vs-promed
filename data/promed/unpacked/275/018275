[According to the data of the World Reference Laboratory for FMD at
Pirbright, during the years 1990-2002, Zambia reported several
outbreaks of FMD serotypes SAT1 & SAT2. These serotypes, as well as
SAT 3, are regarded as endemic in several southern African countries.
FMD virus serotype SAT2 spread during 2000 outside the African
continent -- to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

Neighboring Botswana has recently suffered an outbreak of FMD,
serotype SAT2, after an extended period of freedom from the disease.
Consequently, Botswana's "free zone without vaccination" status has
been suspended by the OIE.
The serotype responsible for the current FMD outbreak in Zimbabwe --
see Foot & mouth disease? - Zimbabwe: OIE (02) 20020419.3990 -- has
not been reported yet. These results, as well as those of the current
serological investigations in Zambia, will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
[OIE statistics in Handistatus II indicate 5 outbreaks occurred in
2000 and 4 in 1999. ProMED-mail applauds the timely reporting of
current occurrences of this important disease in the SADC countries,
see references below. Well done OIE!!! - Mod.PC]
