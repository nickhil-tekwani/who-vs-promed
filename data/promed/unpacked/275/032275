A listeria contamination scare has forced a Victorian foodmaker to
recall its smoked trout mousse products after an elderly Melbourne
man became ill.
The 89-year-old fell ill after eating the Yumi brand of smoked trout
mousse. Subsequent tests proved positive for listeria, Victorian
chief health officer Dr. Robert Hall said.
The health scare has prompted 200 gm. packs of Yumi-branded smoked
trout mousse or dip with use-by dates of 10-16 Mar 2007, to be
recalled from supermarkets across Victoria and New South Wales.
"People should not eat this product and should return it to the point
of purchase," Dr. Hall said. "The company is cooperating with the
recall and has assisted us in the investigation."
Department of Human Services spokesman Bram Alexander said the
89-year-old man taken ill fully recovered after treatment [with antibiotics].
