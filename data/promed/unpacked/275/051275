Thailand reports 3 deaths of suspected bird flu infection
---------------------------------------------------------
BANGKOK, 23 Sep (Xinhuanet): Thailand on Thursday added 3 deceased patients
to the list of suspected cases of bird flu infection.
The 3 patients, including a pair of mother and daughter and a separate boy,
passed away with pneumonia symptoms in the north eastern province of
Kamphaengphet in past 15 days, said Dr Kamnuan Ungchusak, the chief of the
Communicable Diseases Department of the Public Health Ministry. He said the
lab test of the three cases would come out in a few days.
Since the avian influenza rebounded in the kingdom in July, an 18 year old
man has died last month in central Thailand, pushing the kingdom's bird flu
casualty to 9. In the first wave of bird flu outbreak at the beginning of
this year, 8 people in Thailand were killed by the epidemic. Another 19
people have died in Vietnam, bringing the Asian death toll to 28.
Another 128 patients in Thailand have been observed for possible infection
of the disease since early July. 114 of the cases have been cleared and the
rest are still waiting for test results.
