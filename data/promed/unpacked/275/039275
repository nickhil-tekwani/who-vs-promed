[see
WHO EHEC meeting report 970704155934]
We report the preliminary results of an investigation of an outbreak of EHEC
infection in Finland.
Index, and primary cases in families:
On 2 July an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) (strain O157:H7) was cultured
from a 1 year and nine-month-old male. [The next day], his brother, three
years of age, developed severe disease leading to hemolytic uremic syndrome
(HUS). The family of these brothers lives in Kurikka [about 150 km north of
Turku] in Botnia [Bothinia] province. Two days later six patients (one was
toxin negative and resided geographically apart from the five others)
appeared in one rural municipality (Alavus) [about 50 km east of Kurikka] in
Botnia Province to which the first two patients had a vague connection; the
family of the first two cases visited a large shopping mall which is situated
in an adjacent separate municipality 28 June. This shopping mall is very
frequently visited by the inhabitants of Alavus. The six index cases which
appeared in Alavus (8,000 inhabitants) had seemingly little in common
(elaborate in-depth interviews did not reveal a common source); two patients
were found in the same day care group, but otherewise no clear geographical
clustering was found.
On 11 July a culture negative 14-year-old male developed diarrhea resembling
EHEC disease developed yet from another municipality (Nurmo) [about 20 km
northeast of Kurikka, about 25 km northwest of Alavus] in Botnia Province.
This patient had taken amoxicillin before his stool culture [was taken].
Kurikka, Alavus, and Nurmo in Botnia province are situated within 70
kilometre radius from each other. The first 8 patients who are very likely
primary or index cases were all young boys.
Secondary cases within families:
After the first unimodal peak in Alavus a second wave was observed among
close contacts (same family or family day-care group). High secondary attack
rates were found among close contacts, especially in two families which
provided day-care to other children as well. After subsequent propagation
adults and young girls were affected. Altogether by 17 July 21 patients were
noticed of which 5 lack positive culture. Cases were defined as
bacteriologically confirmed cases or clinical cases linked to them. No one
died and the only patient so far who developed HUS is seemingly recovering.
Special circumstances that preceded outbreak:
Meteorological circumstances that preceded the outbreak are worth commenting.
After midsummer, heavy rainfall occurred after a very long dry season. Heavy
rainfall was followed by an exceptional heat wave; in Finnish summers
temperatures rarely rise to 30C. A shallow small lake which is surrounded by
agricultural activity is situated in Alavus where there are two popular public
beaches. In Alavus, a popular fair (thousands of people from surrounding
areas visited Alavus) with numerous fast food street kitchens took place
27-28 June.
Analytic approach:
A field study, i.e., a case control study was initiated to study possible
sources of the outbreak. We selected two different control series: 1) Day-
care and family contacts, and 2) 25 randomly chosen 1- to 6-year olds and
their siblings and parents in a stratified manner from three different
administrative units of Alavus.
Comment:
A common source for the outbreak has not yet been identified. Outbreak index
patients in the families were young boys, who were contagious for close
contacts. A common feature in young boys' interaction with the environment
might be associated with the common source. We might be able to determine a
common source, which might be associated with exceptional meteorological
conditions preceding outbreak favouring bacteria growth in food, and its
growth and mobility in soil or in lakes.
