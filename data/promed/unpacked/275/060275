[The main purpose of the Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS)
application is the registration and documentation of certain
important infectious animal diseases. The EC Member States and the
other countries connected to ADNS are responsible for supplying the
system with the necessary information, in line with the provisions
laid out in Council Directive 82/894/EEC, last amended by Commission
Decision 2004/216/EC. The latter includes the updated list of 26
notifiable diseases: see
<http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/en/consleg/pdf/1982/en_1982L0894_do_001.pdf>.
The countries currently participating in ADNS are: Andorra, Austria,
Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Denmark, (Faroe islands),
Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland,
Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands,
Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, United Kingdom.
The system deals with 2 types of outbreak, primary and secondary.
"Primary" refers to an outbreak of a contagious animal disease not
epizootiologically linked with a previous outbreak in a region, or
the 1st outbreak in a previously unaffected region of a Member State.
The notification must be sent within 24 hours of confirmation of the
outbreak. Once a primary outbreak is entered into the system, an
e-mail is sent to all the countries connected to the application.
"Secondary" refers to an outbreak following a primary outbreak in an
already-infected region. For the secondary outbreak, the notification
must be sent by the 1st working day of each week.
A weekly (every Friday at 3:30pm) e-mail message is sent to all the
ADNS members, summarising all primary and secondary outbreaks that
have been entered into the system. The data are accessible in the
web-site
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/animal/diseases/adns/adns_en.htm>.
The annual data included in table 11 cited above seem to be temporary and
might be updated when final data are obtained. This relates mainly to
diseases such as BSE, whose confirmation might take longer. - Mod.AS]
