An outbreak of hemorrhagic fever has killed at least 23 people in Guinea's southeastern forest region since February [2014] when the 1st case was reported, health authorities in the West African nation said on Wednesday [19 Mar 2014].

At least 35 cases have been recorded by local health officials, said Sakoba Keita, the doctor in charge of the prevention of epidemics in Guinea's Health Ministry.

"Symptoms appear as diarrhoea and vomiting, with a very high fever. Some cases showed relatively heavy bleeding. We thought it was Lassa fever or another form of cholera but this disease seems to strike like lightning. We are looking at all possibilities, including Ebola [virus disease], because bushmeat is consumed in that region and Guinea is in the Ebola belt," Kaita said. No cases of the highly contagious Ebola fever have ever been recorded in the country.

Keita said most of the victims had been in contact with the deceased or had handled the bodies. He said those infected had been isolated and samples had been sent to Senegal and France for further tests.
More than half of the mineral-rich nation's 11.4 million people live on less than USD 1 a day and many lack access to basic medical facilities and qualified medical staff.

[The forested south-eastern region of Guinea (Nzerekore), where cases of yellow fever (YF) were reported in 2008, borders on Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire, which reported YF outbreaks in 2009 and 2011 respectively (see ProMED-mail archives below).

It is urgent to get a lab diagnosis as soon as possible, and if it is YF, obtain vaccine to protect the population of that region of Guinea and that of the regions across the border.

[The mention that "most of the victims had been in contact with the deceased or had handled the bodies" is a typical story for viral hemorrhagic disease outbreaks in Africa. Family members prepare the bodies for burial (without protective gear), and in cleaning the bodies, there is contact with infected bodily fluids, leading to transmission of the virus to the individuals preparing the bodies.

The differential diagnosis of a hemorrhagic fever on the African continent would also include other viral hemorrhagic fevers including filovirus diseases such as Ebolavirus, and Marburgvirus and arenavirus diseases such as Lassa fever and Lujo virus, bunyavirus dseases such as Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever and hantavirus induced disease. The newswire does mention Lassa fever, suggesting it has been ruled out, but it does not definitively state that tests have eliminated Lassa fever virus as the etiology. While many of these hemorrhagic fever viruses have not been identified in Guinea previously, the possibility of expansion of range of the as yet unidentified host/vector animal is ever present. As a reminder, there was a major outbreak of Marburg fever in Angola in 2005, the 1st documented outbreak in that country (see Marburg hemorrhagic fever - Angola (48) 20050617.1708, Hemorrhagic fever - Angola: Marburg virus confirmed 20050322.0831, Undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever - Angola: RFI 20050315.0751). In addition, the possibility of another as yet not previously identified virus is also present. The Lujo virus, a novel arenavirus was identified in 2008 in a woman from Lusaka Zambia, with spread to contact to healthcare workers involved in her care and transport to South Africa for treatment (see Undiagnosed fatalities - S. Africa ex Zambia (10): arenavirus 20081028.3409 and Undiagnosed fatalities - South Africa ex Zambia: RFI 20081005.3139).

Information on the results of laboratory tests on these cases as well as information on the epidemiological investigations, especially in potentially identifying the index case and exposure history of the index case would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
