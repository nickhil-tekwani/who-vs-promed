The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported today [16 Sep 2022] on a human case of infection with influenza A(H1N2) variant (A(H1N2)v) virus [in Wisconsin]. The case is in a patient <18 years of age. An investigation by local public health officials is ongoing.

A total of 7 human infections with variant novel influenza A viruses have been reported in the United States in 2022, including 3 H3N2v (West Virginia) and 4 H1N2v (Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, Wisconsin) viruses.

When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine (but not people) is detected in a person, it is called a "variant influenza virus." Most human infections with variant influenza viruses occur following exposure to swine, but human-to-human transmission can occur.

It is important to note that in most cases, variant influenza viruses have not shown the ability to spread easily and sustainably from person to person. Early identification and investigation of human infections with novel influenza A viruses are critical so that the risk of infection can be understood, and appropriate public health measures can be taken.

[As previous comments by Mod.UBA have mentioned, most H3N2v infections have occurred in children with exposure to swine; many have occurred at agricultural fairs in individuals, including children who have had contact with pigs. Limited human-to-human spread of this virus has also been detected in the past but no sustained or community spread of H3N2v has been identified. Sporadic infections and even localized outbreaks among people with this virus may continue to occur. It's not necessary to avoid agricultural fairs where swine are present. However, people should protect themselves against H3N2v when attending agricultural fairs, particularly where swine are present.

The risk of H1N2v virus spillover from pigs to people is the same as for H3N2v virus described above. Given the sporadic spillover of swine influenza virus variants from pigs to people, one can expect more cases to occur in humans in the future. - Mod.TY]
