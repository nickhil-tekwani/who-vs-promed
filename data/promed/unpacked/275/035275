The government has banned consumption of bush meat in the southern region after a bacterial disease killed 28 hippos in Liwonde, raising fears more water animals might be affected.

The director of Parks and Wildlife Brighton Kunchedwa said the number of hippos killed due to the bacterial disease, anthrax, has risen from 22 to 28 this week [week of 26 Nov 2018].

"Preliminary laboratory tests show that the hippos were affected by anthrax, [and] this is why we are suspending the sale of bush meat in the affected area in the south," he said. He said the government would take action against anyone found selling the bush meat. It was not immediately known which other wild animals also get affected by anthrax [in Malawi].

[A sensible precaution. We have already seen hippo bush meat causing problems in Uganda and Zambia, and Malawi does not need a repetition for the lesson to strike home. Dr. Kunchedwa is well advised, because hippos are carnivores and cannibals. For all one knows, wildlife anthrax might have been lurking in the park out of sight and unappreciated until the infection was shared with a scavenging hippo.
