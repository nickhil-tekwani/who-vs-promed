A woman died in the General La Madrid partido [2nd-level administrative subdivision] of Buenos Aires province, as confirmed by the municipality. With this case, the total is 17 [cases], as stated by the Ministry of Health, despite the assurances of this health agency that there is no outbreak.

The patient who died was hospitalized for several weeks, during which investigations were carried out in order to determine whether this was a case of [a] hantavirus [infection]. In fact, the province indicated that, with the location, it was within the "endemic area". In addition to the La Madrid partido, cases in Florencia Varela have been recognized.

According to Health, the statistics show an increase of 10 cases compared with 2017, which is attributed to questions of seasonality. "We have discarded an epidemic or epidemiological risk," this agency stated to Talam.

Also, the province is charged with a surveillance operation and recommended preventive measures to avoid the presence of the long-tailed rat. For this, it suggested to close openings in doors, walls and around pipes, maintain cleanliness with water and bleach, locate vegetable gardens and firewood at least 30 meters [100 feet] from houses, and cut grass and weeds up to a radius of 30 meters around the house.

Also, ventilate places that have been closed up before entering them. Cover the mouth and nose with a damp handkerchief before entering and cleaning up (floors, tables, drawers and cupboards) with one part bleach for every 10 parts of water. When camping, do so far from weeds and trash dumps; do not sleep directly on the ground, and consume potable water.

Be attentive when symptoms occur, such as fever, malaise, headache, coughing, and vomiting.

[The number of cases of hantavirus infections continues to increase in Buenos Aires province this year (2018). The specific symptoms that this patient above had were not specified, nor was the test used to establish a hantavirus infection diagnosis. Apparently, she was hospitalized for several days before her death. Her death may have been due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome.

As with the report above, the reports of hantavirus infections that ProMED-mail receives very seldom mention which hantavirus is the etiologic agent of the case. However, a previous report from Argentina in 2017 (Hantavirus - Americas (16): Chile (LR), Argentina (BA), USA (PA) 20170220.4850930) indicated that the hantavirus involved in Buenos Aires province was Buenos Aires hantavirus. The case above might have been due to infection by the Buenos Aires virus.

Although the long-tailed mouse was mentioned as the rodent host in the report above, the rodent host of this virus has not been determined. The long-tailed mouse (pygmy rice rat _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), is the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus that is found in the Andean region of Argentina and Chile, much further west than Buenos Aires province.
