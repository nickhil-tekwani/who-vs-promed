On 4 Oct 2019, Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) officials reported another equine case of eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) and another horse with West Nile virus (WNV).

The horse testing positive for WNV, an unvaccinated 2-year-old Standardbred mare in Lapeer County, 1st showed clinical signs of fever, paddling, and recumbency (down and unable to rise) on 30 Sep 2019. She was euthanized and confirmed positive on 4 Oct 2019.

As of today [8 Oct 2019], officials have treated more than 541 000 acres for mosquitoes in efforts to halt the spread of EEE and WNV.

WNV transmission occurs when infected mosquitoes feed on animals, as well as humans, after having fed on infected birds.

Clinical signs of WNV in horses include:

**Mild anorexia and depression
**Fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation (twitching);
**Hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound);
**Changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they're daydreaming or "just not with it;"
**Occasional drowsiness;
**Propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control);
**Spinal signs, including asymmetrical weakness; and asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia (incoordination).

West Nile virus has no cure; however, some horses can recover with supportive care. Equine mortality rates can reach 30-40 percent. The American Association of Equine Practitioners includes WNV as one of the core diseases all horses should be vaccinated against at least annually.

The Ohio Department of Agriculture confirmed the 1st 2 positive cases this year [2019] of West Nile virus in Ohio horses.

A horse in Stark County confirmed with WNV was vaccinated once in the spring but did not receive a booster. The 2nd horse's county of origin and vaccination history are not yet known. The spread of WNV in horses is preventable with proper vaccination, and horse owners are urged to ensure their animal's vaccine and boosters are up to date.

West Nile virus is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flulike symptoms, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed. Changes in mentality, drowsiness, driving or pushing forward (often without control), and asymmetrical weakness may be observed. The mortality rate from WNV can be as high as 30-40 percent in horses. Infection with WNV does not always lead to signs of illness in people or animals. WNV is endemic in the United States, and Ohio has reported positive cases in horses each of the last few years.

These WNV cases follow the Ohio Department of Agriculture's report of eastern equine encephalitis in an Ashtabula County horse on 29 Aug 2019. Since then, 2 additional horses have been confirmed with EEE, one each in Geauga and Portage counties.

"West Nile virus and eastern equine encephalitis are serious diseases that can be prevented with proper vaccination," State Veterinarian Dr. Tony Forshey said. "I encourage all owners to work with their local vet to keep their animals healthy."

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also should work to reduce the mosquito population and eliminate possible breeding areas.

Recommendations include:
Removing stagnant water sources; keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening; and using mosquito repellents.

Because WNV and EEE can also be transmitted to humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes, animals diagnosed with these diseases are a sign that people should also take steps to guard themselves against mosquitoes by applying repellent and wearing protective clothing. Both diseases are very rare in humans, and only a few cases are reported in the United States each year.

There are no confirmed human cases associated with any of these equine cases in Ohio.

The Ohio Department of Agriculture is working with the Ohio Department of Health and local health officials to monitor both outbreaks.

Suspected horse cases should be reported to a veterinarian as soon as possible. Citizens who are concerned about an illness should contact their physician.

On 10 Oct 2019, a 5-year-old Azteca horse with unknown vaccination status in Tuolumne county displaying neurologic signs was confirmed positive for West Nile virus. The gelding is alive.

For 2019, a total of 15 horses have been confirmed positive for West Nile virus. The positive horses were located in Fresno (2), Kern (2), Madera (2), Merced, Riverside, Tuolumne, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Joaquin, Stanislaus (2) and Ventura counties. Eight horses were unvaccinated; 7 horses had an unknown vaccine history, and zero (none of these) horses were vaccinated. Three horses died or were euthanized and 12 are alive and recovering.

CDFA continually monitors and investigates equine neurologic cases for the presence of WNV in California. CDFA urges horse owners to consult their veterinarian concerning a WNV vaccination program to ensure maximum protection of their horses.

[West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus 1st detected in the United States (U.S.) in the New York City area in 1999. Since 1999, the virus has spread throughout the U.S. and Canada, infecting birds, humans, horses, and other animals. As of 2015, more than 27 000 horses in the U.S. have been infected since the disease was 1st identified. The virus is maintained in the wild bird population and is spread between birds by mosquitos. Birds are considered the natural reservoir for WNV since high levels of virus circulate in their bloodstream. Mosquitos acquire WNV in blood meals from infected birds and pass it on to other birds, animals, and people. Mosquitos that feed on an infected horse or human have not demonstrated the ability to ingest enough of the virus to transmit it to other animals or humans; therefore, horses and humans are considered "dead end hosts."

Clinical Signs
West Nile Virus may cause a wide range of clinical illness ranging from mild" flu-like" signs to encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) that may be fatal to both humans and horses. While horses are susceptible to WNV infection, many infected horses do not develop clinical illness and recover uneventfully.

Consult a veterinarian if your horse exhibits any of the following clinical signs:

- Fever
- Incoordination, especially in rear limbs, causing stumbling and falling
- Generalized weakness, muscle twitching, seizures or coma
- Drooping lips and lip smacking, head drooping, grinding teeth
- Hypersensitivity to touch or sound
- Recumbency (inability to rise)

Diagnosis
Any horse displaying abnormal behavior or neurologic signs should be examined by a veterinarian to rule out neurologic diseases, such as WNV, Equine Herpes Virus-1, Equine Protozoal Myeloencephalopathy, Eastern/Western Encephalomyelitis and Rabies.

Blood samples should be collected by a veterinarian and sent for diagnostic testing. The WNV IgM capture ELISA test is a specific test that detects acute WNV infection in animals, is usually positive within 6 days post infection and can remain positive for up to 2 months post infection. A positive WNV IgM Capture ELISA test is indicative of recent infection. Unexposed animals vaccinated for WNV will test negative on the WNV IgM capture ELISA test.

Treatment and Prognosis
Currently, there is no specific treatment for WNV. Supportive care includes administration of anti-inflammatory drugs and intravenous fluids. Recumbent WNV positive horses are at a higher risk of dying or requiring euthanasia. For horses exhibiting clinical signs of WNV, the case fatality rate is approximately 33%; however, many infected horses will fully recover following infection.

Prevention
Vaccination and mosquito control minimize the risk of WNV infection in horses. Although the number of WNV infected horses has declined over the last five years, WNV remains an important disease in unvaccinated horses. The American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) recommends incorporation of a WNV vaccine as an annual core vaccine in equine vaccination protocols. Currently, there are four United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-licensed WNV vaccines available for horses in the U.S. Horse owners should consult with their veterinary practitioner to ensure current WNV vaccination status of their horses.

Mosquito Control
Minimizing horse exposure to mosquitoes during the peak mosquito feeding periods at dawn and dusk decreases the risk of horse exposure to WNV. Application of mosquito repellant can also effectively reduce the number of mosquito bites on horses. Mosquito control efforts to eliminate mosquito breeding sites are also important. Methods to eliminate mosquito breeding sites include:

- Draining unnecessary standing water found in wheelbarrows, tires, etc.
- Cleaning water containers at least weekly (i.e., bird baths, plant saucers)
- Scheduling pasture irrigation to minimize standing water
- Keeping swimming pools optimally chlorinated and draining water from pool covers
- Stocking of water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (Contact local mosquito control for assistance) or use mosquito "dunk" available at hardware stores.
