The British Parliament is expected to approve a measure in March that would
make British farmers directly liable for compensation for any illness
caused by the food they produce. This means that a victim of food poisoning
could sue a farmer if the source of the infection could be traced to a
particular foodstuff and farm. A plaintiff would be required merely to
establish a causal link but not to prove any fault or negligence on the
part of the farmer. Since the mid-1980s the principle of strict liability
has applied to manufacturers but not to primary producers. Amending the
British Consumer Protection Act would be required to incorporate such an
amendment into British law.
Alison Lindley, principal lawyer at the Consumers' Association, said: "It
should give an extra incentive for supermarkets and food processors to
insist on the traceability of the products they sell."
The National Farmers' Union is worried about several aspects. "There are
potentially serious difficulties with food such as grain or milk, where the
produce of many different farmers is bulked up,"said Tessa Crago, head of
food and marketing. "We want assurances that farmers would not be liable
for environmental hazards outside their control." Farmers would have the
so-called "state of the art" defense -- that their product was safe as
judged by the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time it
was sold.

[The implications are far reaching and perhaps unenforceable. However, it
will generate many law suits and headaches. It totally neglects the aspect
that most food mishandling/poisoning comes from the consumer*s home, not
the producer. It also neglects to account for the aspect of processing
plants, such as butchers, and restaurant establishments. It forces the
question: What happens if someone becomes ill from restaurant food? Is the
fault of the eating establishment, or the producer? How is this expected
law going to handle such cases as these? It is regrettable that the law
does not take a firmer stand with regard to proof instead of its apparent
superficial approach of a *casual link*. I wonder how many British farmers
will decide that this is an excellent time to cease farming. Will that have
an impact on their food production for the nation? I can only hope that US
law makers will not follow the British and diminish an already decreasing
food producing resource.]
