Pasco County public health authorities are trying to determine what
may have caused 3 cases of Legionnaires' disease. 2 cases were
diagnosed on the same street in Port Richey.

"We just heard of a 3rd case that's in a different location 4 miles
[6.5 km] away," said Dr David Johnson, director of the Pasco County
Health Department.

The 3 cases follow last week's [week of 24 Oct 2011] outbreak of
Legionnaire's disease in Plant City [Hillsborough County, Florida]. 3
people were diagnosed to the bacterial infection in the Meadows
Countrywood neighborhood last week. One of the patients died.
Initially the Hillsborough County Health Department suspected a
community hot tub may have been the source of the illness. That has
since been ruled out. No known cause has been identified.

"Sometimes the cause jumps right out at you," Pasco's Dr Johnson said.
"But often the cause is never found," he added.

There is no common connection between Pasco County's 3 cases, except
from location. 2 of the patients live on the same street. The 3rd
lives nearby.

The cause could be as simple as a dirty showerhead. People who live
near one of the Port Richey patients say he was rushed to a hospital
in an ambulance. Johnson suggests not waiting that long for anyone who
feels ill. "If you have symptoms, if you're developing a fever and
cough you need to get in and see your doctor," he said.

Legionnaires' disease comes from bacteria usually found in water. The
bacterium that causes it thrives in warm and wet environments, and
people contract the disease by breathing in contaminated water vapor.

"It is not contracted person to person," explained FOX 13's Dr Joette
Giovinco. "However, if several people were exposed to the same source,
then many of those people may get sick, depending on their health."

Port Richey is a small town in Pasco County on the west coast of
Florida in the United States, north of the Tampa-St.
Petersburg-Clearwater metropolitan area, with a population was 3294 in
2004 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Richey,_Florida). Plant City
is in Hillsborough County, Florida, east of Tampa along Interstate 4,
with a population of 34 721 in 2010; Plant City is known as the winter
strawberry capital of the world
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_City,_Florida).

Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused by a gram negative
bacillus of the genus _Legionella_, most commonly _Legionella
pneumophila_. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of the
disease; more than 70 percent of cases are due to _L. pneumophila_
serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand, where _L.
pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has accounted for only 45.7 percent of cases
of community-acquired legionellosis, and _Legionella longbeachae_ has
accounted for 30.4 percent of cases (Yu VL, et al: Distribution of
_Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by culture in patients
with sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: An international
collaborative survey. J Infect Dis. 2002; 186(1): 127-8;
http://www.legionella.org/lp_distribution.pdf). Risk factors for
Legionnaires' disease include age over 50 years, cigarette smoking,
diabetes, chronic heart or lung disease, and immunosuppression.

Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis that is less
severe than Legionnaires' disease. Pontiac fever takes its name from
an outbreak in 1968 in Pontiac, Michigan, USA.

Legionnaires' disease, and presumably Pontiac fever, is acquired by
inhalation of an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_. Usually
a building's contaminated water system is incriminated as the source.
_Legionella_ are found primarily in the hot water portion of plumbing
systems and in cooling towers. Water temperatures of 25-40 deg C
(77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in
water storage tanks of plumbing systems. Aerosolization of the
contaminated warm water can occur in showers, spa pools, sprays in
groceries, fountains, car washing establishments, and cooling towers.
Also, other sources include aerosolized windscreen wiper fluid not
containing alcohol that may enter a car
(http://www.higieneambiental.com/sites/default/files/images/pdf/legionelosis-journal-epidemiol.pdf)
and contaminated aerosols that may enter a car when a car is driven
through puddles from rain puddles on asphalt roads (see ProMED-mail
post Legionellosis - Spain: (AN) 20100612.1973).

In contrast, in Australia and New Zealand, Legionnaires' disease has
been associated with gardening and exposure to potting mix, compost,
and soil; in these countries _L. longbeachae_ has been commonly found
in potting mix, compost, and soil and cultured from the respiratory
specimens of patients with sporadic community-acquired pneumonia.
Cases of community-acquired pneumonia due to _L. longbeachae_ also
have been reported sporadically in Europe
(http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19497).

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates has become a helpful
tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one
genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens suggests
transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found
in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of
legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be
confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental
isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/). However, the
clinical diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease is commonly made on the
basis of serology or the _Legionella_ urinary antigen test, and not
culture of patient specimens. - Mod.ML]
