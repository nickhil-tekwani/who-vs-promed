Ex-patients of dentist who reused syringes have HIV or hepatitis
----------------------------------------------------------------
3 former patients of Dr. Stephen Stein have been discovered to have hepatitis A or C or HIV. Stein ceased practicing in June 2011 after it was discovered he was reusing syringes during oral surgery. Any former dental or oral surgery patients of Dr. Stephen Stein's who have not been tested and who remember receiving intravenous medications, including sedation, at one of his offices, are encouraged to get tested.

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment [CDPHE], which has urged more than 8000 former patients of Dr. Stephen Stein to seek testing for the three diseases, said that in order to protect patient confidentiality, it would not disclose which of the specific infections the patients have. Stein, who had a practice at 8671 S. Quebec St. in Highlands Ranch from September 1999 until June 2011, also saw patients at New Image Dental in Cherry Creek between August 2010 and June 2011.

Stein made an agreement with the Colorado State Board of Dental Examiners to cease practicing in June 2011 after the health department concluded its investigation. Because he is no longer practicing, the state does not see Stein as a current threat and has stated that it will not conduct its own testing of him in an effort to match genetic material [of the contaminating viruses] of the infected patients with his. Hollynd Hoskins, a Denver attorney who is representing some of Stein's
former patients, called it a public health issue and said that Stein's patients have "an absolute right to know if Dr. Stein himself was infected with any of these diseases."

Referring to the Rose Medical Center case where operating room technician Kristen Parker infected at least 18 patients with hepatitis C in 2008-09, Hoskins said that ruling out whether Stein is carrying any of these diseases should be the first step. "Dr. Stein should be asked to comply with voluntary testing by the CDPHE as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDCP]," she said. "I would also hope that law enforcement agencies such as the Denver Police Department or U.S. Attorney's Office would ask for that voluntary testing for the public health issue of all of these patients. If that is not successful, I would hope one of the agencies would seek a court order."

Hoskins said she assumed that the CDCP and CDPHE are already conducting an investigation similar to what they did with the Rose hepatitis C outbreak, in order to reach an opinion about whether there is a causal link between the patients who have tested positive for infectious diseases, and about the likelihood that the infection occurred during their treatment at Stein's office. "It's a pretty high probability that they contracted these diseases from Dr. Stein's office, merely from what we know now from his unsafe injection practices," she said, adding that if they were not infected from Stein directly, it is likely that diseases were contacted via patient-patient transmission.

According to a statement from the CDPHE, it cannot be determined that the positive results are necessarily linked to Stein's practice, due to "the time frame and potential for infections from other source."
