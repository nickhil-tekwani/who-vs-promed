Sent on behalf of Dr Martin Blake, Chief Veterinary Officer, Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, Ireland

Further to the [above] request for information posted on 23 Jan 2017, we would like to provide the following response:

_Mycobacterium bovis_ has been isolated from several cattle involved in this outbreak of bovine tuberculosis [TB]. The epidemiological information does not support the hypothesis that deer have played a role in transmitting TB to cattle in this case. _Mycobacterium caprae_ has not been detected in Ireland.

[We are very grateful to Ireland's national Veterinary Services for the above immediate, firsthand, authoritative information addressing the request for information on Ireland's bTB situation. It has been noted that _M. caprae_ has not been detected in Ireland and that deer have not played a role in transmitting TB to cattle in the relevant case. - Mod.AS
