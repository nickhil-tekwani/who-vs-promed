The fatality rate of avian influenza cases in Turkey, otherwise known as
bird flu, remains low in comparison to cases observed in Asia, the World
Health Organization (WHO) noted on Tuesday -- according to IRIN.
"Turkey is seeing a fatality rate of 20 per cent, which is lower than the
fatality rate observed in Asia, which was around 58 per cent," Cristiana
Salvi, a spokeswoman for WHO's mission in Turkey, said in the capital,
Ankara, citing early detection and treatment as the primary cause.
"There could be other factors which we are investigating as a lot of cases
are still in hospital," she cautioned, however, noting the need for further
observations. "We need to know how the cases progress," she said, adding
that of the 20 confirmed cases of the virus in the country, 4 had died. All
but 2 of the cases involved young people or children below the age of 18,
the WHO official said. Salvi's comments come as more than half the world's
nations, including health and finance experts, gather in Beijing for a 2
day international conference, co-hosted by the World Bank, along with China
and the European Union (EU), to raise more than a billion dollars to
mitigate a possible bird flu pandemic -- particularly among developing
countries in Asia.
The 2 day conference is the 2nd such gathering of its kind following a
November meeting in Geneva, which agreed on a 3 year plan for tackling the
spread of the disease. Speaking at the conference on Tuesday [17 Jan 2006],
bird flu experts called upon the world community to urgently amass a war
chest to combat the virus and prepare nations should a pandemic strain
emerge, Reuters reported.
"There is a significant shortfall of funds in many affected
countries...which will seriously hamper their prevention and control
efforts," Qiao Zonghuai, the Chinese deputy foreign minister, was quoted as
telling the donors' conference in Beijing. "In the fight against avian
influenza, no country can stay safe by looking the other way," he warned.
Underscoring that urgency, Indonesia's health ministry said a toddler who
died on Tuesday was being tested for bird flu days after his 13 year old
sister died of the H5N1 virus, according to local tests. A surviving sister
was also being tested, the report said. On Monday, Turkish authorities
confirmed that a 4th person, a 12 year old girl, was indeed suffering from
the H5N1 virus when she died on Sunday in hospital in the eastern city of
Van, despite a mass culling of almost 1 million birds across the country by
the authorities to contain the outbreak.
WHO says that new outbreaks in birds continue to be reported across the
country. To date, poultry outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian
influenza have been confirmed in 12 of the country's 81 provinces.
Outbreaks in an additional 19 provinces are under investigation.

Turkey: avian influenza situation - WHO update 6
------------------------------------------------
As of 18 Jan 2006, laboratory tests conducted at Turkey's National
Influenza Centre in Ankara have confirmed an additional case of human
infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case is a 4 year old boy
from the district of Dogubayazit in Agri Province in the eastern part of
the country. An outbreak in poultry began in the district in December 2005.
The child developed symptoms on 5 Jan 2006 and was admitted to hospital on
13 Jan 2006. He is being treated at a hospital in Erzurum Province.
Like the 2 cases confirmed on 16 Jan 2006, also from Dogubayazit, exposure
in this case occurred before the government's launch of an intensive public
education campaign. Rapid surveys conducted in the most severely affected
eastern part of the country have found an almost universal awareness of the
disease and of the risk factors for infection. This awareness has been
accompanied by behavioral changes that are expected to reduce opportunities
for human infections to occur.
As the virus is now known to be present in birds [poultry] in many parts of
the country, some additional human cases should be anticipated in the
immediate future. The number of these cases is, however, expected to
decline as high-risk behaviours become less common and culling operations,
which are presently under way, reduce the number of infected birds.
The newly confirmed case brings the total in Turkey to 21. Of these cases,
4 were fatal. All 4 were residents of Dogubayazit.
A 2nd shipment of laboratory specimens arrived yesterday at a WHO
collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom. Apart from providing
diagnostic confirmation, the laboratory will undertake viral
characterization and genetic and antigenic analyses of viruses. These
studies help determine whether the virus is evolving. Antigenic analysis of
the virus helps ensure that work on the development of a pandemic vaccine
stays on track. Initial results are expected later this week.
