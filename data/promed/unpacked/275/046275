_Echinococcus multilocularis_ found in 2 foxes in Southern Jutland
------------------------------------------------------------------
The news about these findings were released this morning [10 Jul 2013]. However, later today we detected another positive fox, from the same area, which is not mentioned in the press release (The press release, in Danish, can be found at http://www.vet.dtu.dk/Nyheder/Nyhed?id=%7bDC4E4263-505A-4554-BD23-BB1C85C34327%7d).

Since September 2011 we have surveyed _E. multilocularis_ in wild carnivores. A total of 856 carnivores have been studied so far: 692 foxes, 150 raccoon dogs, 11 badgers, 3 raccoons, and one wolf. Of these, 7 foxes were positive, all of them originating from the same area in southern Denmark -- the Hojer region near the German border. At present, 32 foxes have been analyzed from this area (local prevalence: 7/32 = 21.9 percent; national prevalence: 7/692 = 1.0 percent).

The 3 new findings were from foxes shot between December 2012 and February 2013 and revealed worm burdens of 1527, 596, and 33 adult _E. multilocularis_. Up until now previous worm burdens have not exceeded 27 worms.

All animals were analyzed by the sedimentation and counting technique (Eckert et al. 2001), and worms from all positive foxes have been submitted to Jenny Knapp [Laboratory of Chrono-environment, University of France-Comte, Besancon, France] for sub-genotyping.

A PCR is currently being implemented in our laboratory aimed at analyzing faecal samples in future Danish surveillance programs.

[_E. multilocularis_ was first found in Denmark in 2000, when the parasite was identified in 2 foxes in the Copenhagen region (Petersen JE, Kapel CM, Deplazes P: _Echinococcus_ multifocal. Epidemiology, clinical findings and treatment. Ugeskr Laeger. 2001; 163(3): 275-7 --in Danish).

Over the past 20 years _E. multilocularis_) has been spreading north in Germany and it is not surprising that it will continue its northern expansion into Denmark. The situation has recently been reviewed (Enemark HL et al: Detection of a high-endemic focus of _Echinococcus multilocularis_ in red foxes in southern Denmark, January 2013. Euro Surveill. 2013; 18(10): 20420; http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20420).

The distribution of _E. multilocularis_ in Scandinavia is intriguing with reports from the arctic parts of Norway (Svalbard) (see ProMED reports from 2000 below) and reports from Southern Sweden from 2011, but no reports from Finland despite surveillance. - Mod.EP
