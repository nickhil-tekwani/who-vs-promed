Ebola fever disease [EVD] emergency preparedness and response
-------------------------------------------------------------
A few days ago health officials in Guinea reported an increase of ebolavirus activity in particular in the Kissidougou aera (centered by the Gueckedou or Gueckedougou prefecture) close to the borders of Sierra Leone and Liberia: 11 suspected cases (2 were then confirmed), and 41 contacts were reported last week.

Since 18 May 2014, the MOHS [Ministry of Health and Sanitation] surveillance team in Kailahun, Sierra Leone, observed an increase in the number of patients presenting with diarrhea and vomiting symptoms in the communities around Koindu town; 3 patients died including a nurse, a student and a housewife on 23 May 2014. These cases are under investigation.

On 24 May 2014 one sample was collected from a patient, suspected EVD case, at Koindu health post, Kailahun District (bordering Guinea) and sent 25 May 2014 to the Lassa Fever Laboratory LFL (supported by Metabiota Inc. and Tulane/Harvard Universities). The sample was immediately tested by MOHS and showed positive for ebolavirus Zaire by conventional RT-PCR (MOHS -- Harvard University reagents) and by real time RT-PCR (Metabiota Inc., USAMRIID and Critical Reagents Program reagents). Further tests including antigen detection and IgM ELISA are currently being run (Metabiota Inc. -- USAMRIID reagents).

The Lassa Fever Laboratory is receiving more samples from suspected cases and potential contacts of this confirmed case; 8 more samples from viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) suspected cases were received on 26 May 2014. The same tests were run (conventional RT-PCR and real time RT-PCR) and the LFL confirms 6 more cases originating from Kailahun District.

The Lassa fever outreach team is currently on site in Kailahun investigating, searching for suspected cases and contacts; 300 kits of personnel protective equipment have been distributed to health officials in Kailahun, the Lassa Ward and the Lassa Fever Laboratory in Kenema (USAMRIID, Metabiota) and more are to be delivered shortly (Tulane, USAMRIID, Metabiota Inc.).

The World Health Organization was notified on 25 May 2014 of an Ebola virus disease [EVD] outbreak in Sierra Leone including one laboratory confirmed case and 5 community deaths reported from Koindu area bordering the current Ebola fever epidemic epicenter of Gueckedou, Guinea.

Global results
--------------
From the Ebola Surveillance & VHF Preparedness - Metabiota Inc. Laboratory team at KGH in partnership with the MOHS Lassa fever Laboratory of Kenema Government Hospital (supported by Tulane University): from 19 Mar to 20 May 2014 a total of 140 EVD suspected cases sampled in Sierra Leone tested negative for ebolavirus.

Suspected cases of Lassa fever and other potential VHF were also tested for ebolavirus when required, 14 samples tested positive for Lassa virus and one for West Nile virus.

Training
--------
385 health workers at the national level have been trained in 3 weeks for emergency preparedness and response to EVD(MOHS/Metabiota Inc.).

Intensified health communications and a weekly task force chaired by the Minister were implemented. Since then, upon request of the MOHS, a "Metabiota Daily report" has been produced since the beginning of the Ebola alert in Sierra Leone reporting on laboratory diagnostics, training progress and other issues related to EVD preparedness and response. 30 reports have been produced for the MOHS and WHO to monitor the EVD outbreak response.

Background
----------
- 23 Mar 2014: samples from 2 patients from Guinea, collected by the Guinean authorities were handed to the MOHS (Sierra Leone) investigation field team and subsequently referred to the Lassa laboratory and the Metabiota Viral Hemorrhagic Fever (VHF) team at the Kenema Government Hospital. All were found to be negative for Ebola, Lassa fever, Marburg and Yellow fever by real time RT-PCR on the following day.

- 24 Mar 2014: Sierra Leone outbreak response is decided, after MOHS (Ministry of Health and Sanitation) official request. Partners (Metabiota Inc. USAMRIID, NIH) are contacted to support the response

- 25 Mar 2014: an MOHS multidisciplinary field team carried out epidemiological investigations to examine reports on the death of a suspected case; 15 probable contacts were identified, sampled and tested negative by RT-PCR for all existing 5 known ebolavirus species.

- 28 Mar 2014: 2 Metabiota Inc. experts leave Washington for Freetown with approx. 800 pounds (363 kg) of equipment, reagents and other supplies (such as, personal protective equipment (PPE) from USAID). The aim was to develop an efficient health survey of the border adjacent to the Guinean epidemic region, where confirmed and suspected EVD cases have been reported. The immediate objectives included: all necessary means for an early and specific diagnosis of EVD and providing a reporting system (forms) for a precise follow up and early response on suspected EVD cases: intensive and emergency training for all Health Officers of the most threatened districts bordering Guinea and Liberia and the Western district sheltering air and sea transportation facilities for commercial exchanges with Guinea and Liberia; assess risk, identify means (reporting forms, practical material for case management, disinfection, safe environment) and develop strategy for prevention of viral hemorrhagic fever emergence and/or spread in country.

Partners
--------
National including the Ministry of Health and Sanitation: HE the Minister of Health, Chief Medical Officer (CMO), Director of Infectious Disease Control; MOHS Kenema Government Hospital (KGH), KGH including the Lassa Fever Laboratory, and the Metabiota VHF team: Biological diagnostic of VHF; WHO office in Freetown: Regional reporting on Ebola outbreak and training; MSF: awareness and reporting on Ebola suspected cases; US Embassy: in country facilitator (airport, MOHS). International: WHO Geneva: Communicable Disease Programs; USAMRIID: expertise (RS), equipment and reagents; NIH: providing expertise (LH), equipment and reagents; Tulane University (laboratory support from Harvard University); USAID: providing supplies (PPE, protective masks, etc.)

Training
--------
After the 1st Task Force meeting on EVD emergency preparedness and response, chaired by the Minister, attended by the 2 Metabiota experts as requested by the MOHS, it was decided to train in less than 10 days all key health officers involved in the response of medical support/clinics (case management), survey (case definition) and field investigation (contacts) on EVD. A total of 75 Hospital Medical Officers, 35 Surveillance Medical Officers and, 25 Port Health Officers have been trained in 8 days. Also 50 Primary Heath care workers from 5 districts (250 trainees) were trained by the previous trainees (Health Officers): total of 385 health workers from Sierra Leone have been trained and supported by complementary equipment (PPE, rubber boots, concentrated bleach, WHO VHF manual, thermometers, etc.), and other reporting forms. Ultimately post training and active surveillance (by the former trainees) has been conducted in the 5 districts bordering the Guinea EVD epidemic area.

Laboratory diagnostics
----------------------
Metabiota Inc., working with the MOHS, had previously installed Zaire Ebola-specific real time RT-PCR (2012), which was used to screen the 1st cases reported to ProMED-mail. Since that time and under MOHS and WHO guidance, Metabiota Inc., with support from international partners from the US (USAMRIID, DTRA, NIH, and others), the Democratic Republic of Congo (INRB) and Gabon (CIRMF), have installed and are currently running a full suite of Ebola specific and differential diagnostics, including: Zaire Ebola-specific antigen and IgM capture ELISAs, Zaire Ebola-specific and pan-filovirus RT-PCR, as well as published PCR assays for the detection of Lassa fever, yellow fever and other confounding, locally endemic pathogens, as well as laboratory reagents and equipment, and personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers exposed to suspected cases.

Also the Lassa fever laboratory, supported by Tulane University has developed an ebolavirus test (conventional RT-PCR) provided by Harvard University. All Ebola suspected cases are tested by both collaborating teams as a permanent and efficient control.

Providing supplies
------------------
PPE: masks, gloves, lab coats and full suits, shoe covers, respirators -- as well as general laboratory supplies (from international partners at USAMRIID, NIH, and Metabiota Inc. Cameroon)

Material & methods
------------------
Reagents and supplies given by USAMRIID and NIH, including 2 thermal cyclers (USAMRIID/Metabiota), one MagPix(R) (multiplex platform for qualitative and quantitative analysis of proteins and nucleic acids); real time RT-PCR for Ebola, Marburg, Lassa viruses, yellow fever, West Nile and chikungunya viruses; IgM and IgG ELISA assays for Ebola serology; Ebola antigen capture ELISA.

Capacity building
-----------------
A MOHS-KGH laboratory technician has been trained to perform real time RT-PCR against all pathogens presently tested. Training continues on other assays.

Providing expertise
-------------------
The head of the laboratory, present full time on site, joined by 2 scientists from the Applied Diagnostics Branch, Diagnostic Systems Division, USAMRIID. Senior scientist coordinated and supervised Metabiota support (scientific & academic) to MOHS and under the guidelines of WHO Metabiota Inc. Provided Public Health comprehensive forms (public health sectors recording data from clinic, laboratory, epidemiology and surveillance).

Upgraded the security level & data management system (recording, analysis, transfer) of the sample collection for EVD/VHF in partnership with KGH Lassa Ward (HK); security level of the Lassa laboratory was upgraded by all partners; protocols reviewed for safe handling and disposal of Ebola samples and waste; laboratory workers and visiting scientists protection enhanced.

Safety
------
A specialized infectious disease ambulance provided by Metabiota Inc. is being used to transport all suspected cases and every precaution is made to protect both health care workers and local populations from the risk of spread of the diseases.

The MOHS National Task Force, working with Metabiota Inc. and other partners, is continuing to actively conduct surveillance for EVD, as well as for Lassa fever; the Kenema Government Hospital has been designated as the central treatment facility for anyone suspected of contracting either Ebola or Lassa fever in the country.

[ProMED-mail thanks the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation for this update. The collaboration with external partners is exemplary.

We would be interested to know why so many different types of tests are necessary to confirm an EVD case, but suppose these are experimental reagents being field tested for research as well as public health purposes.

There is an excellent map by CDC of the affected areas at
