The Kansas Department of Agriculture Division of Animal Health (KDA-DAH) was notified in August [2017] by the Kansas State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory that a horse in Reno county has tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV). The horse was euthanized due to the severity of the illness. This is the 1st reported equine case of WNV in Kansas in 2017. Horse owners are encouraged to vaccinate their horses to prevent the spread of WNV.

West Nile virus is the commonest mosquitoborne disease in Kansas and in the United States. It causes severe neurological disease in horses. Birds and humans are also susceptible to the virus; other livestock and pet animals are not susceptible to WNV. Clinical signs in horses can include fever, incoordination, generalized weakness, drooping lips, teeth grinding, and inability to rise. There is no specific treatment for WNV, but several effective vaccines are available for use in horses.

Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas.

For more information about WNV or other animal disease issues in Kansas, go to the KDA-DAH website at http://www.agriculture.ks.gov/AnimalHealth. If you have questions, please call KDA-DAH at 785-564-6601.

Kentucky animal health officials have now confirmed 5 equine cases of West Nile virus (WNV) this year [2017]. Kentucky Equine Programs manager ES "Rusty" Ford said Murray State University's Breathitt Veterinary Center confirmed 2 additional cases -- one in a horse from Hart County in another in a Russell County horse -- on 18 Aug 2017.

In Hart County, an 8 year old Tennessee walking horse gelding presented [on Aug 2017] with lethargy, muzzle twitching, muscle fasciculation (twitching) in the shoulders and chest, and mild hind-limb ataxia (incoordination). As of [18 Aug 2017], the treating veterinarian reported the horse was continually improving, Ford said. The affected horse has no WNV vaccination history, he said.

In Russell County, a 3 year old thoroughbred gelding presented [14 Aug 2017] with muscle fasciculation and mild ataxia that progressively worsened over a roughly 24-hour period. As of [18 Aug 2017], Ford said the horse's veterinarian reported that he was responding "favorably to treatment and improving rapidly." The horse was "documented to have been vaccinated in 2015, thought to have been vaccinated in 2016, and received a single vaccination in spring 2017," Ford said.

From 2001 to 2016, Kentucky confirmed 728 cases of WNV in horses, Ford said. Of those, 96 per cent (699) were not adequately vaccinated -- they had not been vaccinated in the 12 months preceding disease onset or they'd only received an initial vaccination with no follow-up boosters. Ford said 30 per cent of the confirmed cases (219) died or were euthanized.

West Nile is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation; hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. The equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 per cent.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot; in areas with a prolonged mosquito season, veterinarians might recommend two boosters annually -- one in the spring and another in the fall. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

California animal health officials have confirmed an additional case of West Nile virus (WNV) in a horse in that state. "On [18 Aug 2017], an unvaccinated yearling Warmblood filly in San Joaquin County displaying severe neurologic signs was confirmed positive for WNV," said a statement from the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA). "Due to the severity of clinical signs the filly was euthanized.

"For 2017, a total of 7 horses have been confirmed positive for WNV," the CDFA continued. "The positive horses were located in Glenn, Contra Costa, Fresno, Kern (2), Riverside, and San Joaquin counties. 5 horses were unvaccinated and 2 horses had unknown vaccination status. 5 horses died or were euthanized and 2 horses are recovering."

It is a busy year for arboviruses. It is a sad year for horse owners. Vaccination is critical and yet still many do not vaccinate their animals. Effective vaccines are available. Generally WNV is combined with eastern and western equine encephalitis and tetanus. This is a lot of protection for your horse for a small investment, but a large investment of time, money, love, and effort if you haven't vaccinated; please do so. - Mod.TG]
