Children hit by E. coli bug at swimming pool
--------------------------------------------
4 children are recovering today [Sat 18 Sep 2004] after an outbreak of
_Escherichia coli_ infection at a swimming pool. The young swimmers were
exposed to the bacteria at Stretford Leisure Centre in Manchester.
2 young children required hospital treatment following the outbreak. Health
officials said all the youngsters were responding well to treatment. It is
understood that the outbreak occurred after chlorine levels dropped in the
teaching pool at the center on the morning of Sun 5 Sep 2004.
Dr Rosemary McCann, consultant in health protection with the Health
Protection Agency, said: "They routinely test the water 4 times a day, and
when it was discovered that chlorine levels were low, the cause of the
problem was identified immediately, and repairs were carried out within
hours. "Anyone swimming in the pool at any other time should be reassured
that chlorine levels were such as to prevent the spread of infection."
_E. coli_ O157, which is usually associated with food poisoning, causes a
potentially serious form of diarrhea.

[If the pool chlorine level is indeed checked 4 times per day, it would
seem that the window of opportunity for contamination would be quite small.
It is not clear what repairs were needed other than the addition of
chlorine to the pool water.
It is indeed possible that the pool environment is more responsible than
the water itself. In other words, besides pool water, what food/liquid
refreshments did the affected children ingest? - Mod.LL]
