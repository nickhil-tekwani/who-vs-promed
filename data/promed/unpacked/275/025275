Italy's anthrax outbreak widened as the disease spread to 6 more farms
in the country's south, bringing the total affected livestock holdings
to 19 since the 1st confirmed cases almost 4 weeks ago.

The illness killed livestock in 3 towns southeast of Naples with
previous cases as well as in a village about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
east of the 1st outbreaks, the Italian Ministry of Health said in an
alert today [29 Sep 2011] published online by the Paris-based World
Organization of Animal Health, or OIE.

Anthrax, which has been used as a biological weapon, is caused by
spores of the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_ and can survive in soil
years after an outbreak, according to the OIE. Livestock typically
become infected by ingesting spores from the soil or in feed,
according to the group.

The disease killed cattle and sheep on 3 farms in Montesano sulla
Marcellana, as well as livestock in Accettura and Corleto Perticara,
adding to previously reported cases. Italy also found anthrax in
Cirigliano, the 1st case there, according to the alert to the OIE.

The outbreak is continuing, and measures to fight the disease include
movement controls for livestock and disinfection of infected premises,
the animal-health group said. Animals are not being vaccinated, the
OIE said.

[As it is spreading to other farms and especially a single horse on
one farm, we can safely assume that the current spread is from biting
tabanid flies feeding on moribund and freshly dead animals. This will
continue until the vaccination kicks in. In northern latitudes the
onset of frosts in late September terminates fly activity. - Mod.MHJ]
