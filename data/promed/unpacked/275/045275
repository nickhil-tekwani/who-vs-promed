Legionnaires' disease cases reach 22 in Delaware
------------------------------------------------
The total number of legionnaires' disease cases in Delaware has reached 22
so far in 2003, state health officials said Tue 26 Aug 2003.
The Delaware Department of Public Health (DPH) has been tracking a rise in
the number of legionnaires' disease cases since the beginning of 2003. On
average, between 1995 and 2002, the state saw only 14 cases. Of the 22 so
far, 14 of those infected have been Sussex County residents. 13 were from
New Castle County, one from Kent County, and another 4 were out-of-state
residents who were admitted to hospital in the state. 3 remain in hospital.
2 patients (one of whom was from Sussex County) died from the disease,
while the rest were released following treatment.
According to the DPH, the patients' ages ranged from 35 to 81 years. They
worked at a variety of occupations and so far displayed no signs of being
infected from any common sources. All but 3 of the patients were known to
have risk factors associated with being infected with legionnaires'
disease: smoking, chronic lung disease, compromised immune systems, kidney
problems, or diabetes.
The increase in Delaware's legionnaires' disease cases, however, reflects a
rise in occurrence of the disease throughout the region, health officials
note. As of 17 Aug 2003, the states of Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Washington DC have seen a
total of 304 cases. Those same areas saw a total of 117 reported by this
time in 2002.
State health officials said they are still cooperating with investigators
from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on the
cases. Officials from CDC are still investigating whether the increase is
real or simply an effect of better reporting mechanisms and more attention
being paid to diagnosing suspected patients.

More cases of legionnaires' at police HQ
----------------------------------------
The number of police staff confirmed with legionnaires' disease after
working at the Counties Manukau headquarters has risen to 14. An additional
6 staff members were waiting to hear whether they had contracted the
bacterial condition after working at Harlech House in Otahuhu.
The building was closed in early June 2003, and work began this week on
renovations, including replacing the water tower with a dry air
conditioning system and upgrading toilets and showers.
The Police Association has employed an independent investigator, lawyer
Richard Earwaker, to review the work and ensure it met international
standards. Association vice president Richard Middleton said the police had
agreed to the review, aimed to give staff confidence the revamped building
is a safe working environment.
Mr Earwaker would compare international standards to work on Harlech House,
said Mr Middleton. He would also make recommendations on any further work
to ensure the building is safe before staff return.
Mr Middleton this week asked management when a medical report on 400 staff
tested for legionnaires' disease would be made available.
The cases confirmed so far dated from 2000 -- when legionella was first
found in the building -- to February 2003.
