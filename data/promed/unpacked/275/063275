Organic produce has tentatively been determined to be behind an _E. coli_ O157 outbreak that has sickened children in the Seattle-King County area in Washington. All of the patients are younger than 15 years of age, and 3 are younger 5 years of age. The 7 patients have been reported during 22 Apr 2021 - 1 May 2021 time period, according to Seattle-King County Public Health. 6 of the children have been so sick they had to be admitted to hospitals. This includes 2 children who developed a potentially life-threatening type of kidney complication called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Both are recovering.

"Our investigation is ongoing. We have identified multiple types of fresh produce, mostly organic, in common among the majority of cases but cannot yet rule out other possibilities," the health department reported in its outbreak update. "Public Health is conducting interviews with cases and their parents/guardians to help identify any common exposures. We are also working with the Washington State Department of Health to complete further testing, to help identify possible related cases in other counties, and to begin traceback of any products in common."

The health department is warning consumers that fresh fruits and vegetables -- including organics -- can sometimes have germs such as _E. coli_ on them. The contamination of such foods has been implicated in numerous outbreaks in recent years. The department encourages consumers to thoroughly rinse fresh produce before preparing and consuming it raw.

Investigators are continuing their work on the outbreak and will post updates as new information becomes available.

[The serotype of this cluster of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ has been identified as O157 and it is now suspected that fresh produce may be the vehicle for transmission. This vehicle is quite noteworthy in this infection related to contamination of the food anywhere in the food chain but often occurs in the field. - Mod.LL
