[Byline: Saleh Mwanamilongo, Ignatius Ssuuna]

The wife and 1-year-old daughter of the man who died of Ebola in Congo's major city of Goma this week has the disease, the health ministry said [Thu 1 Aug 2019], while Rwanda closed its border with Congo over the virus outbreak that now enters its 2nd year.

The man died on [Wed 31 Jul 2019] after spending several days at home with his large family while showing symptoms. This is the 1st transmission of Ebola inside Goma, a city of more than 2 million people on the Rwandan border, a scenario that health experts have long feared. The painstaking work of finding, tracking, and vaccinating people who had contact with the man -- and the contacts of those contacts -- has begun.

"We're seeing the 1st active transmission chain in Goma and expect more to come," the International Rescue Committee's Ebola response director, Andre Heller, warned in a statement.

Rwanda's state minister for foreign affairs Olivier Nduhungirehe confirmed the border closure, a day after WHO officials praised African nations for keeping their borders open. Last week [week of22 Jul 2019] Saudi Arabia stopped issuing visas to people from Congo while citing the Ebola outbreak, shortly before the annual hajj pilgrimage there this month [August 2019].

Congo's presidency swiftly condemned Rwanda's decision, and local Congolese at the busy border expressed frustration. Several hours later Congo's presidency said the border had reopened. A Rwanda health ministry statement called the events a "traffic slowdown" as surveillance for Ebola was reinforced. The ministry advised against unnecessary travel to the Goma area.

WHO has recommended against travel restrictions amid the outbreak but says the risk of regional spread is "very high." Rwanda, Uganda, and South Sudan have long begun vaccinating health workers. In June 2019, 3 people died in Uganda before their family members were taken back to Congo for treatment and Ugandan officials declared the country free of the disease.

The death on [Wed 31 Jul 2019] in Goma "in such a dense population center underscores the very real risk of further disease transmission, perhaps beyond the country's borders, and the very urgent need" for more global support, United Nations agencies said in a joint statement marking a year of the outbreak.

[Rwanda's border apparently was only closed briefly. The Ministry of Health of Rwanda confirmed in a statement Thu afternoon [1 Aug 2019] that the border with the DRC was open, "following traffic slow-down this morning" when measures were put in place to reinforce screening practices.
Advising against any unnecessary travel to Goma because of the increase in Ebola cases, the Ministry said, "Rwanda remains Ebola free." (https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-rwanda-close-border-congo-fear-ebola-20190801-o4vborb3sjejvgpxdj7i3vedbm-story.html). - Mod.LK]

A 4th case of Ebola virus disease has been confirmed in Goma City on Thu 1 Aug 2019. The information was confirmed to 7SUR7.CD by a source within the World Health Organization (WHO).

In the space of 3 days, 3 cases (from the same family, editor's note) were confirmed in this city of more than one million inhabitants which had already recorded its 1st case on 14 Jul 2019.

The 1st 2 patients have not survived and according to the information in our possession, the 3rd case who was a child of 1 year also died, while this 4th case was detected this [Thu 1 Aug 2019] is already at the Goma ETC.

- Thu 1 Aug 2019. 2 new cases in Goma
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/08/two-new-cases-goma-drc-ebola-outbreak-reaches-1-year-mark
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

2 new cases in Goma as DRC Ebola outbreak reaches 1-year mark
-------------------------------------------------------------
Another 2 Ebola cases were confirmed in the provincial capital city of Goma today [1 Aug 2019], marking the 1st active transmission there, a development that prompted reports of a border closure with Rwanda.

The quickly evolving developments come on the 1-year anniversary of the Democratic Republic of Congo's outbreak declaration.

New cases are man's family members
----------------------------------
Both of the new cases in Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo's (DRC's) hard-hit North Kivu province are family members of a man recently identified as the city's 2nd case, the Associated Press (AP) reported today [1 Aug 2019], citing Ebola response workers. One is the man's 1-year-old daughter, and the other case -- confirmed shortly after -- is his wife.

The family members are considered high-risk contacts. Goma has now reported 4 Ebola cases, 2 imported from the main outbreak areas, plus 2 secondary cases.

Rwanda: no border closure, but reinforced screening measures
------------------------------------------------------------
Earlier today [1 Aug 2019] Rwanda's foreign affairs minister announced a border closure, which the World Health Organization (WHO) advised against in the temporary recommendations it made when declaring the DRC's Ebola outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.

Goma borders the Rwandan city of Gisenyi, where tens of thousands of people cross each day. Travel or trade restrictions could hurt the DRC's economy and slow the flow of response sources that are needed to fight Ebola, the WHO has warned.

After condemning the reported border closure, the DRC president's office said the border had reopened.

Transmission persists in Beni, 13 new cases
-------------------------------------------
Without daily updates from the health ministry, it has been difficult to closely track developments with the DRC outbreak hot spots, but a new situation report from the WHO that includes data as of 28 Jul 2019 said sustained transmission continues in Beni [North Kivu]. Ebola infections from that health zone make up 61% of new cases in the previous 7 days and a number of cases and contacts from the hot spot traveled to other areas.

Mandima [Ituri] is another hot spot, especially the Some area in the north part of the health zone. Cases from that focal area have seeded cases to Mambasa [Ituri] in recent weeks, the WHO noted. "The response has poor access to this health area due to community resistance, and this leads to more cases."

Overall, incidence rates haven't changed since the WHO's last weekly report. There were 79 new cases in the most recent week, along with 47 more deaths. The number of health workers infected in the outbreak has risen to 146.

Meanwhile, the WHO's online Ebola dashboard today [1 Aug 2019] shows that the DRC reported 13 new confirmed cases yesterday, raising the outbreak total to [2713]. Health officials are still investigating 293 suspected cases.

Another 2 people died from their infections, putting the outbreak's fatality count at [1823].

US officials mark 1-year since DRC outbreak declaration
-------------------------------------------------------
Federal officials from the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) today [1 Aug 2019] observed the outbreak's 1-year mark by updating reporters on agency efforts to assist with the outbreak.

Henry Walke, MD, MPH, director of the CDC's division of preparedness and emerging infections and its incident manager, said 12 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) experts are on the ground in Goma, with others in the DRC capital Kinshasa and in neighboring countries. Plans include doubling those staff numbers over the next month, and he said dozens more at the CDC's Atlanta headquarters are involved in supporting the Ebola response.

Walke had a few more details about Goma's 2nd case, a 46-year-old man whose illness was detected earlier this week and who has since died [31 Jul 2019]. The man lived on the outskirts of Goma and was treated at home during most of his illness before he was transferred to Goma's Ebola treatment center. As such, the man's household members are considered high-risk contacts.

The CDC added that it is also committed to strengthening the DRC's health system to help reduce the risk of future outbreaks, not only Ebola, but other threats such as HIV, measles, tuberculosis, and malaria. "CDC's commitment to global health goes hand in hand with CDC's commitment to the safety and security of the American public," the agency said in its statement.

Other HHS officials spotlighted the US government's role in developing and testing medical countermeasures, including vaccines and experimental treatments. Rick Bright, PhD, director of the HHS Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) said officials believe the Ebola vaccine and experimental therapies have had a significant impact on the trajectory of the outbreak.

Meanwhile, Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said the group's researchers are still involved in Ebola vaccine and treatment trials. He noted that randomized control trial of 4 Ebola treatments underway in the DRC's outbreak region was recently amended to increase enrollment from 500-545 participants to 725 participants. Currently, there are 631 patients enrolled, and Fauci said he expects the trial will reach that number before the outbreak winds down.

Augustin Augier, CEO of ALIMA, explains why the involvement of local populations in the response to the Ebola virus disease must be strengthened in order to stop the outbreak.

One year after the outbreak was declared in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the disease has killed more than 1800 people and there have been more than 2500 confirmed cases in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri.

Today [31 Jul 2019], ALIMA treats confirmed patients in 2 of the largest treatment centers in eastern DRC, in Beni (61 beds) and Katwa (Butembo, 72 beds). We also work in 4 peripheral transit centers to care for suspected patients.

- Wed 31 Jul 2019. South Kivu ex Goma
[Medical Express, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report, abridged, edited]
https://m.medicalxpress.com/news/2019-07-dr-congo-quarantines-south-kivu.html

Doctors in South Kivu, a province that had previously skirted the Ebola epidemic in eastern DR Congo, have quarantined 15 people over fears of infection by the deadly virus, local authorities said [Wed 31 Jul 2019].

"We have just quarantined 15 people in Birava -- a mum and her 6 children who came from Goma as well as other members of her family who had come to meet them," said the senior administrative official for Birava, Christian Birhinjira.

Birava is located on Lake Kivu, about 30 kilometres (18 miles) north of Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu.

"The mother and her 6 children came from Goma and were in a family whose leader had fled an Ebola treatment centre," he said. The chief doctor at Birava hospital, Ciza Nuru, confirmed that 15 people were in quarantine.

"We received an alert about suspected cases of Ebola from Goma. We looked for a lady and her children and other people she had been in contact with," he said.

Nuru said a team of specialists, including from the World Health Organization (WHO), had come from Bukavu and would return on [Thu 1 Aug 2019] "with equipment to deal properly with the situation."

[The Washington Times, abridged, edited]
https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/aug/1/cdc-sends-dozen-staffers-new-ebola-hotspot-drc/
[Byline: Tom Howell Jr.]

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thu [1 Aug 2019] it has dispatched a dozen staff members to fight Ebola in Goma, a major transit hub that is the new flashpoint in the one-year fight against the deadly disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The CDC said it's also positioned staff in the surrounding countries of South Sudan, Uganda and Rwanda, though it remains leery of dispatching front-line workers to conflict-ridden zones in northeastern DRC.

It said it is working with State Department officials on a "fluid" basis to determine whether it's safe to dispatch US workers, as needed, to affected areas outside of Goma.

If the security situation improves, "we could expand our staff even more," said Henry Walke, the CDC's director of preparedness and emerging infections.

In the meantime, the CDC is directing staff at the US embassy in Kinshasa -- the DRC capital -- the World Health Organization headquarters in Switzerland, and CDC headquarters in Atlanta to assist the effort from afar.

Researchers are supporting a clinical trial of 4 therapeutic drugs in the hot zone, and it is monitoring the success of a trial vaccine by Merck.

[4 Research. Serological study

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The 2013-2016 Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa was the largest and deadliest outbreak to date. Here we conducted a serological study to examine the antibody levels in survivors and the seroconversion in close contacts who took care of Ebola-infected individuals, but did not develop symptoms of Ebola virus disease. In March 2017, we collected blood samples from 481 individuals in Makeni, Sierra Leone: 214 survivors and 267 close contacts. Using commercial, quantitative ELISAs, we tested the plasma for IgG-specific antibodies against three major viral antigens: GP, the only viral glycoprotein expressed on the virus surface; NP, the most abundant viral protein; and VP40, a major structural protein of _Zaire ebolavirus_. We also determined neutralizing antibody titers. In the cohort of Ebola survivors, 97.7% of samples (209/214) had measurable antibody levels against GP, NP, and/or VP40. Of these positive samples, all but one had measurable neutralizing antibody titers against Ebola virus. For the close contacts, up to 12.7% (34/267) may have experienced a subclinical virus infection as indicated by detectable antibodies against GP. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether these close contacts truly experienced subclinical infections and whether these asymptomatic infections played a role in the dynamics of transmission.
