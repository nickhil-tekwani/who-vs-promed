At least 17 people, including several children have contracted the parasitic infection, trichinosis, after eating smoked brown bear cub in Kataiga village in the Tomsk region of Russia, according to a Tass report (computer translated).

The fact of poisoning is confirmed, 12 people were hospitalized, one victim was taken to Tomsk to SibGMU clinics." All in all, there are 17 cases of trichinosis. "In total, 29 cases of poisoning were detected in the region," said EDDU employee Verkhneketskiy district.

The head of Verkheketsk district, Alexey Sidikhin, said: 'The bear was killed in the summer, if not in the spring. We are now looking for the hunters on our own. They also need to be warned that there is a risk of serious illness.' Some meat was smoked, some salted. The hunters gifted the meat to villagers.

Village chief Ivan Nasonov said: 'We have seized 57 kilograms of bear meat. 'Some was sent for analysis, some was destroyed.'

Trichinellosis, or trichinosis is a parasitic disease caused most commonly by the roundworm _Trichinella spiralis_. If someone ingests undercooked or raw meat with the encysted larvae, the stomach acid releases the larvae which mature to adults in the intestine. After about a week the female starts releasing larvae which enter the bloodstream and find their way to skeletal muscle where they encapsulate.

There can be gastrointestinal symptoms mimicking acute food poisoning when there is activity of the adults in the intestine.

Sudden appearance of fever, muscle soreness and pain with swelling of parts of the face are early classic signs. This can sometimes be followed by retinal hemorrhages and other ocular signs.

With heavy infections, cardiac, respiratory and neurological problems may ensue with death by heart failure being most common. The more larvae you ingest, the more serious the disease.

[The above newswire provides no detail diagnosis of the parasitic infestation of bear meat.

Trichinellosis is a serious zoonotic disease caused by parasitic nematodes of the genus _Trichinella_. There are 8 species and 3 additional genotypes in the genus, with various geographic and host preferences.

While humans are susceptible to infection by all species of the parasite, _Trichinella spiralis_ is the most common, infecting pigs, horses, rats, many carnivores, among other animals.

Trichinellosis is a disease listed in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code which Members are obligated to report to the OIE. Diagnostic methods and related information are described in the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals. http://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D13992.PDF

Cultural traditional habits of eating raw or undercooked meat play a key role in the spread of the disease. Meats from wild animals (wild boar, dogs, bears, etc.) are a source of small outbreaks among hunters and their associated social groups.

ProMED highly appreciates further information on the confirmation of human cases from knowledgeable sources.
