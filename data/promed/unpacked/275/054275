Warning over BSE infections
---------------------------
British cattle may never be free of BSE despite the introduction of
strict animal feed controls, according to a leading expert.
A report in The Sunday Times claims there are still fears the disease
could be passed from cows to their calves.
Figures show 54 cases of BSE have been recorded in cattle born after
the 1996 ban on meat and bone meal being used in cattle feed.
However, scientists still do not know the cause of the outbreaks, as
each occurred on different farms across the country.
According to Professor James Ironside, of the CJD Surveillance Unit
in Edinburgh, one possible reason is that calves had been infected by
their mothers.
Professor Ironside said he questions whether BSE can ever be totally
eradicated.
"Until we have a clear idea what the source of exposure is, it's
possible we may see more of these cases and over a longer time
scale," he said.
"Cattle might be able to carry the disease for some time."
There is growing pressure on the Food Standards Agency to relax the
ban on beef from cattle over 30-months-old.
Testing regime
It is argued that the measure has a lack of scientific justification,
with only 16 cases recorded so far this year.
Recommendations on lifting the ban will be delivered to ministers next month.
If accepted, the ban could be replaced by a new testing regime for
slaughtered cattle from the start of next year.
Professor Ironside has called for continued surveillance to ensure
BSE does not enter the food chain.
BSE has been linked to Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), a disease
that causes paralysis and death in humans.

Germany Beating BSE
--------------------
Germany's measures to control and beat BSE are having a positive effect.
Consumer minister Dr Gerald Thalheim told a recent farmers' union
meeting in Regensburg that the measures were minimising the risk from
BSE and ensuring consumer safety. The measures are also helping to
restore consumer confidence in beef and winning them back to a safe
and high quality product.
Dr Thalheim said that the most important measure that had been taken
was the ban on meat and bone meal in feed. He added that the testing
for BSE had brought more security, which was helped by the removal of
all specified risk material from the food chain and by stepping up
controls and sanctions on feedstuffs.
He said the federal government had also made Euro 13.8 million a year
available for research.
The number of cases of BSE in Germany is also staring to fall. In
2000, 7 cases were discovered, in 2001 there were 125 cases and last
year 106.
Dr Thalheim said that most of the cases had been found through the
monitoring system and the rapid BSE tests. A third of the cases had
been found through the tests after slaughter.
He added that in Germany they also tested all animals slaughtered
over the age of 24 months, where the European regulation was to test
animals over the age of 30 months.
He said that it was necessary to develop new tests to try to trace
BSE in younger animals and in animals while they were alive. And he
said that the Government was also evaluating the results of testing
animals over 24 months to assess whether it should continue with the
rapid tests in this form.

Commission approves new BSE tests
---------------------------------
The European Commission today approved 2 new rapid BSE tests, Prionics Check
LIA and InPro CDI-5 made by the companies Prionics and InPro. The 2 new tests
should help to stimulate more competition in the field. Following a
laboratory evaluation and a field trial, these tests were recommended
for approval by the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC).
All 5 tests can now be used to screen cattle for BSE. They are
designed to detect BSE in brain material, collected from animals at
the slaughterhouse or which have died on the farm. So far tests
designed to detect BSE in live animals have not been evaluated. All 5
tests are also provisionally approved to detect TSE in sheep and
goats, pending a formal evaluation. The 3 currently approved tests
are Prionics Check Western, Bio-Rad TeSeE (previously Bio-Rad
Platelia) and the Enfer BSE test produced by the companies Prionics,
Bio-Rad and Enfer. They were evaluated by the Commission in 1999.
The 2 newly approved tests have gone through a similar evaluation
process, completed by a field trial under practical conditions. In
March 2003 the SSC recommended their formal approval in the framework
of the TSE Regulation (999/2001). In the EU all healthy bovine cattle
slaughter above 30 months and all fallen stock above 24 months have
to be tested for BSE with some derogation for some countries.

Klein hopes U.S. will "love Alberta beef"
-----------------------------------------
WASHINGTON: Premier Ralph Klein begins his mad cow mission in the
U.S. Tuesday, armed with "I love Alberta beef" T-shirts and a hard
sell about the safety of Canadian meat.
Klein, along with Saskatchewan Industry Minister Eric Cline, is to
hold talks with U.S. agriculture officials, before meeting with
Vice-President Dick Cheney on Wednesday. Klein has a friendship with
Cheney.
The U.S. border has been closed to Canadian beef since 20 May 2003
when a single cow was found to have bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE). More than 2700 other cattle with a connection to the diseased
animal or its feed have been tested and didn't have BSE.
An international panel which reviewed the Canadian investigation and
called it "thorough" is expected to release its final report any day
now. The panel is staffed with experts from the U.S., Switzerland and
New Zealand.
Klein says the message he'll be delivering to the Americans is simple.
"There is absolutely no danger," he said. "The possibility of
catching that disease is one in 10 billion, billion meals."
The lieutenant governor of Montana says the U.S. would be unwise to
open the border before other countries are ready to accept Canadian
beef.
Karl Ohs met with Minister of Intergovernmental Relations Halvar
Jonson Monday and said there's a danger other countries would start
rejecting American as well as Canadian beef.
"I think you have to get all the trading partners  Japan, Korea, all
of those who buy North American beef  and they have to be satisfied
with where we're headed," Ohs said.
But Ohs said it's in his state's best interest to re-open the border
sooner rather than later.
"We're anxious to get normal trade moving again," he said, adding he
will make his position known to the U.S. government. "The longer this
goes on, the more volatile the beef industry in North America is."
Japan is already worried about Canadian beef finding its way overseas
through American exports. The Japanese have asked the U.S. to process
any Canadian-born cattle separately, beginning 1 Jul 2003.
A Japanese delegation is also in Canada this week to do a review of
Canada's investigation into the source of the country's only case of
mad cow disease.
The closed U.S. border is costing the Alberta cattle industry 11
million Canadian Dollars a day.

[The EU exhaustive and updated overview, from which the listed
chapters with relevant authors' names are copied above, is a timely
and useful reference document for all engaged in BSE control,
diagnosis and research.
The following (edited) text is derived from the introductory chapter
on the scope of the overview:
"Between 1997 and early 2003, the European Commission relied on the
Scientific Steering Committee and its TSE/BSE ad hoc Group for
scientific advice and risks assessments related to Transmissible
Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) in general and Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE) in particular. This report in the first place
intends to provide all interested parties with an exploitable account
of 6 years of BSE risk assessments. It is therefore expected to
contribute to continuity in BSE risk assessment at the EU level now
that the SSC and the TSE/BSE ad hoc group have completed their
mandate. The report will also provide risk managers and other
interested people with an understandable introduction to BSE and to
all detailed SSC opinions adopted since 1997.
Part I provides a synthetic overview of BSE-related reports and
opinions prepared since 1997, clarifies the most relevant criteria
for BSE risk assessment, and shows how these were used and converted
into a consistent approach for BSE risk assessment.
Executive summaries of the SSC's main opinions and reports on a number of
specific issues are provided in Part II. They cover issues related to TSE in
humans and animals, BSE risk reduction strategies, the safety of
ruminant-derived products and quantitative risk assessment".
Those engaged in investigations into the origin of BSE in countries
with single or very few cases, might find a useful analysis in the
chapter "A Frame for the Quantitative Assessment of the Residual BSE
Risk in Cattle-Derived Food Products", by D. Dormont, M. Doherr and
Ph. Verger (pages 208-215). - Mod.AS]
