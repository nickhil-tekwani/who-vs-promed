Rabies outbreak alert in Texcoco
--------------------------------
The Center for Community Health in Magdalena Panoayan, municipality
of Texcoco (Mexico), has issued a public warning that rabies has
emerged in this area. A person consulted the health center after being
bitten by a puppy infected with the virus. The puppy subsequently died.

Residents have begun to restrict the movement of their children on
the streets to prevent any attack by dogs and cats who could be
infected with the virus.

For its part, the regional Canine Care Center in Texcoco has reported
that it is monitoring the situation and is raiding the area (to take
dogs off the streets). The Center noted that the rabies outbreak
began on Wed 7 Oct 2010, in the community of Vicente Rivapalacio,
that as a point of reference had, about 4 months ago, presented a
rabies outbreak in the boundaries of San Juan Teotihuacan.

In this regard, health center staff said that the community had not
had a case of this nature for 27 years.

Overall, a campaign has started a few weeks ago in all the
municipalities in the State of Mexico on the strengthening of
National Canine and Feline Rabies Vaccination Week, in which the
Secretary of Health and Director of the State Health Institute of
Mexico (ISEM), doctor Gabriel O'Shea, said the annual target for the
125 municipalities of the state is to apply a total of around a
million vaccinations at no cost to the population.

O'Shea also noted that no case of rabies has been registered in the
State of Mexico since 2006.

[Overall, a solid and continuous program of vaccination of cats, and
dogs and public education regarding the need for the vaccine, and
education about unusual animal behavior that may signal the disease,
are needed to build a long lasting buffer between rabies and the public.

Along the way the emphasis of leash laws, responsible pet ownership
and vaccination tags will contribute to a decrease in packs of street
dogs, and a larger barrier between the public and rabies.

The vaccination campaign that has been started is very important to
decreasing the incidence in animals and people and building that
important barrier between public health and rabies virus. - Mod.TG]
