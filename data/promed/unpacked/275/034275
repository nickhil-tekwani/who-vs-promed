CHIKUNGUNYA (44): REUNION, CORRECTION

I would like to give some precise [details] about the chikungunya [virus]
situation on Reunion Island. In the ProMED-mail posting "Chikungunya (43):
Thailand, Malaysia, Reunion" archive no. 20091031.3767, published on 31 Oct
2009, you mentioned (Source: US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Outbreak Notice): "As of 28 Aug 2009, the French government has reported 3
confirmed cases of chikungunya fever on the island of Reunion. No deaths
have been reported. All cases occurred in the Saint-Gilles-Les-Bains area,
on the western side of the island. However, mosquito activity reports show
that the virus is circulating throughout Reunion."

This last sentence is not totally true. No new cases have been reported
since mid-August 2009 on Reunion Island. As of today [3 Nov 2009], total
cases for the cluster of Saint-Gilles-les-Bains (West Reunion) is 4
confirmed and 1 probable cases between 18 Jul 2009 and 3 Aug 2009.

Mosquito activity is certainly very important but the virus doesn't seem to
circulate throughout Reunion. The French Institute for Public Health
Surveillance will send a message to CDC to give them the same precise
[details].

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr D'Ortenzio for this clarification of the chikungunya
virus situation on Reunion Island and bringing to our attention the good
news that chikungunya virus has not been causing new human cases on Reunion
since early August 2009. Reports from health authorities in the field are
particularly valuable.
