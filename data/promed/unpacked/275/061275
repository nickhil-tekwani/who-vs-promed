Incurable Pierce's disease confirmed in California's Kern County vineyards
------------------------------------
FRESNO, California, 13 Nov 2001 -- Pierce's disease [PD has been confirmed
in a dozen vineyards east of Bakersfield, according to a summer-long
monitoring program led by University of California Cooperative Extension
viticulture farm advisor Jennifer Hashim.
[Scientists from the University of California and other officials are
working with farmers to remove and destroy about 600 infected vines to
avoid further spread of the incurable and fatal disease. In addition,
Hashim is conducting educational programs, consulting with farmers, and
distributing materials on PD identification and management strategies.
PD ... is caused by the bacterium _Xylella fastidiosa_, which clogs the
plant's water conductive tissue, choking off the movement of water and
nutrients from the roots to grapevine canes and leaves. Insects that have
the bacteria on their mouth [parts transmit PD to grapevines when they
feed on fluid in the plant xylem.
PD ... is spread in Kern County by native sharpshooters and the
glassy-winged sharpshooter, a pest introduced to the area about 5 years
ago. 16 infected grapevines identified in summer 2000 in one Kern County
vineyard were removed and destroyed last year. According to Hashim, growers
should quickly remove any [diseased vines [in order ... to minimize the
sharpshooters' opportunities to acquire the bacterium and pass it on to
more vines. ... Glassy-winged sharpshooters are very effective transmitters
of PD.
Hashim's survey work in grapevines was conducted in conjunction with the
General Beale Road Pilot Project [GBRPP, a collaborative research program
of the Glassy-Winged Sharpshooter Task Force of Kern and Tulare Counties.
Project participants are the Agricultural Commissioner offices of Kern and
Tulare counties, California Department of Food and Agriculture, University
of California Cooperative Extension, USDA [-APHIS, and USDA [-ARS. [The
2001 survey started in early April, focusing on 20 rows of flame seedless
grapes adjacent to where diseased vines were pulled out in 2000. ... Some
vines showed severely delayed growth, [but the incidence of PD ... could
not be determined because [of the lack of suitable early season diagnostic
tests.
In June ...400 samples [were collected from vines in the same vineyard and
[from a nearby red globe vineyard [expressing symptoms of PD... --
stunted growth, leaf scorch, and persistent petioles, leaf stems still
attached to the cane after the leaf has dropped off. ... 308 were positive
for PD.
In August the survey expanded to 400 acres within a 2-3 mile radius of
GBRPP, [focusing on red globe, a [very susceptible variety of table
grape. An additional 11 vineyards ranging in size from 3 to 40 acres were
surveyed and 500 more samples were collected. ... All but one vineyard was
confirmed to have [PD-infected vines; 264 vines tested positive [for PD.
In [2002, Hashim will survey selected vineyards to estimate the incidence
of PD in glassy-winged sharpshooter-infested regions, an area ..
encompassing 35 000 acres of grapes in eastern and southern Kern County.

[PD has affected California winegrowers since it decimated vineyards in the
Los Angeles Basin in the 1880s, and again in the 1930s and 1940s. In the
past 5 years, PD caused by the blue-green sharpshooter resulted in
replanting of 775 acres of vines in California's north coast. A new and
more threatening insect vector, the glassy-winged sharpshooter (GWSS), has
spread in southern California and has already affected 25 per cent of
Temecula Valley's 3000 vineyard acres in Riverside County, resulting in an
estimated $13 million in damage in the county. GWSS was accidentally
introduced in 1989 through nursery stock imported from the southern US, and
PD has since spread rapidly. This new vector is voracious, an aggressive
flyer, and feeds and breeds on at least 133 host plants. To date, 15
counties have been identified by the state as being infested with GWSS,
primarily in southern California and the southern San Joaquin Valley, and
there is concern about its possible spread throughout the state,
considering that the vector and the pathogen are probably present in every
county in California where grapes are grown.
There are several strains of the _Xylella fastidiosa_ bacterium. A strain
found only in Brazil and Argentina causes citrus variegated chlorosis
(CVC), which is a major threat to citrus production. Other strains cause
alfalfa dwarf disease, almond leaf scorch, and leaf scorch of oleander in
California.
