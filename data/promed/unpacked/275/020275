In the beginning of February 2007, a marked increase in the number of cases
of acute gastroenteritis in Samokov, a region with 35 000 inhabitants in
western Bulgaria, 50 km (31 miles) to the south of the capital Sofia, was
noted by the Regional Inspectorate for Public Health Protection and
Control. A subsequent outbreak investigation revealed 977 cases of acute
gastroenteritis reported between 5 and 24 Feb 2007. In February 2006, only
3 cases of acute gastroenteritis were reported. Considering the clinical
presentation of the cases and the available laboratory findings, the
outbreak investigation team suggested norovirus as the probable cause of
the outbreak.
Outbreak investigation and control measures
-------------------------------------------
On 11 Feb 2007, an outbreak investigation team, including epidemiologists
from the regional inspectorate and an infectious disease specialist from
the Medical University in Sofia, were in Samokov to meet with the general
practitioners and local public health authorities working in the region. In
order to collect further information on the outbreak, a questionnaire
asking for clinical and epidemiological data was distributed, to be filled
in by patients under the supervision of medical staff. Information was
collected both retrospectively -- on cases of gastroenteritis that had
occurred since the beginning of the month [February 2007] -- and
prospectively.
The following case definition of acute gastroenteritis was used: a patient
with at least 2 loose or liquid stools per day and one or more of the
following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, and
temperature greater than 38.0 deg C (100.4 deg F). All patients included in
the study were asked to give stool samples for laboratory examinations.
In addition, an environmental investigation was launched, and inspections
of food shops, restaurants, and major public places as well as the area's
water supply system were carried out.
In parallel with the ongoing investigations, the public health authorities
in Samokov Region undertook actions aimed at preventing the spread of
disease. These included disseminating information to the public and giving
advice to health-care facilities and places at risk, such as child care
services and schools. The public was informed through the media about the
epidemic situation and the need to practice good personal hygiene,
including proper handwashing. Hospitals and other places at risk were
instructed to take preventive measures and carry out disinfection.
Epidemiological and clinical data
---------------------------------
As a result of the outbreak investigation, 977 acute gastroenteritis cases
were registered as having occurred between 5 and 24 Feb 2007, in the region
of Samokov. [The authors] suppose that the number of patients affected by
the outbreak was higher, however, as the symptoms were relatively mild,
many patients probably did not seek medical assistance and were not
reported by their physicians. The epidemic curve shows that most of the
cases, 791 (81 per cent), were reported between 8 and 15 Feb 2007). [In the
original text, the cases of acute gastrointestinal illness are plotted
according to the onset of disease, reported between 5 and 24 Feb 2007. -
Mod.CP] Cases occurred in all districts of the town and 7 neighboring
villages. The patients belonged to all age groups.
Age (years) / Number of cases
0-3 / 186
4-7 / 153
8-19 / 191
20-60 / 352
greater than 60 / 95
Total / 977
All patients included in the investigation fulfilled the criteria for the
case definition. Their clinical symptoms showed an identical type of
disease progression: an acute onset, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pains, and diarrhea. Most patients (896, 92 per cent) presented all these
symptoms. In 259 cases (27 per cent), muscle pain, general malaise, and
headache were also observed. The stools were 2 to 6 per 24 hours. The
symptoms lasted from 12 to 60 hours, followed by prompt recovery. In most
patients, the illness required no hospitalization. However, 53 children
between 3 and 36 months of age (34.6 per cent of this age group [table
above says 186 aged 0-3 years; 53/186 suggests 28 per cent. - Mod.SH]) were
admitted to hospital with dehydration and treated with standard electrolyte
containing solutions; they all recovered.
Laboratory findings
-------------------
Stool samples were collected from 126 patients and sent for laboratory
analysis. Although all patients were asked to submit stool samples, only
126 did. Samples were not available from the rest of the patients included
in the study.
All samples were tested for _Cryptosporidium parvum_, _Shigella_ spp.,
_Salmonella_ spp., enteropathogenic, enterotoxigenic, and enterohemorrhagic
_Escherichia coli_, _Yersinia_ spp., _Campylobacter_ spp., _Vibrio_ spp.,
_Aeromonas_ spp., _Plesiomonas_ spp., and _Staphylococcus aureus_. However,
no pathogenic bacteria or parasites were isolated from the samples.
All samples were also tested for norovirus. The 1st 36 stool samples
collected at the beginning of the outbreak were examined for the presence
of norovirus by one-step RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction) using primers JV12 and JV13 derived from the RNA polymerase
region in the norovirus genome, as previously described [1]. A specific
326bp amplification product was observed in 11 samples (31 per cent). A
further 90 fecal specimens collected later were screened for the presence
of norovirus by EIA (enzyme immunoassay-Ridascreen Norovirus 3rd
Generation, R-Biopharm). Among these, 11 samples (12 per cent) were
norovirus antigen positive and 9 of them were confirmed by RT-PCR.
Genotyping of norovirus strains is ongoing and the results are expected in
the near future.
In addition, 93 samples taken from children aged 3-36 months were also
examined for rotaviruses by EIA (Ridascreen Rotavirus, R-Biopharm,
Germany). Rotavirus was identified in 2 of them.
Microbiological analysis of 20 samples of drinking water from the water
distribution system in the region was carried out as well. Fecal indicator
bacteria were not found. Viral contamination was not checked.
Conclusion
----------
Considering the large number of patients with acute gastroenteritis -- 977
registered cases within 3 weeks -- a point source of infection (such as the
contamination of drinking water) was initially suggested. However, the
inspection of the water supply system in Samokov did not reveal any
malfunction, and the water samples examined excluded the possibility of
fecal contamination. Patient histories revealed no common source of
infection by food contamination. The fact that the disease had frequently
affected entire families suggested that person-to-person transmission
played an important part in spreading the infection.
Based on the clinical presentation (acute onset with nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pains, and diarrhea), the epidemiological data, and the
laboratory results, the probable cause of the outbreak was thought to be
norovirus. No norovirus outbreaks have been previously reported in
Bulgaria. However, in other parts of Europe and in the United States,
norovirus infections have been seen to affect large numbers of people and
cause serious public health problems [2,3].

[The analysis of the disease situation in the Samokov region of Bulgaria is
consistent with an outbreak of norovirus infection, although the laboratory
analysis is incomplete. Particularly unusual is the extent of the outbreak
and the failure, so far, to identify the actual source of what is regarded
as a point source epidemic.
