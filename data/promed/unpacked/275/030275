A 3.5-year-old bull in County Limerick has been diagnosed with BSE, raising
concerns over the effectiveness of BSE control measures in the Irish
Republic (in full effect since 1996). Limited details are available at
present, the following summaries are taken from the Irish Times website
[see (1)]
and from the national broadcaster RTE
[see (2)].
A press release from the Irish Department of Agriculture and Food will be
posted later at
While not the first such case in Europe, the significance to the Irish beef
industry and food market may be great.
(1) Department confirms County Limerick BSE case
--------------------------------------------
The Department of Agriculture has confirmed that a 3-year-old bull has been
diagnosed with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) on a Co. Limerick
farm. It is the youngest animal to have been found with BSE in the Republic,
and one of the few male animals [with the disease] to have been detected.
The discovery will cast serious doubts on the quality of the controls on
Irish farms to prevent the disease in the national herd. The Minister for
Agriculture, Mr Walsh, has claimed the feed and other controls in the State
are the best in the world. But the Department's Chief Veterinary Officer
Paddy Rogan confirmed the case on RTE radio this morning.
(2)Department Confirms BSE found in young bull
-----------------------------------------------
The Department of Agriculture has confirmed reports that BSE has been
diagnosed in a 3.5-year-old bull. It is the first time the disease has been
found in Ireland in an animal so young.
Up to recently, the industry had been marketing beef on the basis that no
cases had been found in cattle born after controls were tightened on animal
feeds in the mid-90s.

BSE case discovered in County Limerick
--------------------------------------
The Irish government's agriculture ministry has confirmed a case of BSE in
cattle.
The disease has been detected in a 45-month-old bull on a County Limerick
farm and marks the first time bovine spongiform encephalopathy has been
diagnosed in the Republic of Ireland in an animal so young.
Up to now, the Irish beef industry has been selling beef overseas and to
home consumers on the basis that no cases have been found in cattle born
after controls were tightened on animal feeds in the mid-1990s. Until the
start of this year, no animal born after 1996 had become infected, although
3 born in 1997 have been identified as having the disease since the start of
2002.
The discovery may raise doubts about the effectiveness of controls on Irish
farms to prevent the continuing incidence of the disease in the national
herd. It has the potential to damage the country's almost 1 billion BP
[approx. 1.5 billion USD] annual beef export trade, as well as domestic
sales.
Irish Minister for Agriculture Joe Walsh and other senior government
officials have claimed that cattle feed and other controls in Ireland rank
among the best in the world. Ahead of the new report, 2002 had already
emerged as the worst on record for BSE in Ireland, with more than 300 cases
already identified, though none in post-1997 animals.
Paddy Rogan, chief veterinary officer at the agriculture department, said
the case had been identified after the detection of BSE in the herd to which
the bull involved was attached. "On the basis of a series of laboratory
tests, procedures indicate the bull was infected," he said.
He added: "I don't think this case does anything to damage the national
control programme that we have in place. It is clearly working, based on all
the trends we see in the disease. We do not know how it happened in this
case, but we are investigating a number of distinct possibilities. I would
assure consumers that Irish beef continues to be among the safest that can
be eaten anywhere in the world. This case does nothing to interfere with
that situation. This particular animal was found in a herd which was
undergoing a routine depopulation policy which ensures that any possible
risk is removed from the human food chain because we destroy the particular
herd."

[The detection of BSE in a bovine indicates that the animal has been
exposed -- most probably at an early age -- to the BSE agent. It is
generally agreed that the most plausible source of infection is contaminated
meat and bone meal (MBM).
However, another possibility, remote but not excluded, is transmission from
dams to calves, if calving took place within [a few] months prior to the
appearance of clinical BSE in the dams. For this reason, descendents and
cohorts of affected bovines are required to be traced back and destroyed.
Such vertical/maternal transmission might be the background to the
appearance of BAB (born after ban) cases in the UK.
In the present Limerick case, no data have been published regarding the
health status of bull's dam nor on BSE cases in calving dams shortly
previous to its birth. Should vertical transmission not be the case, then
the circulation of contaminated MBMs in Ireland, as recent as 3.5 years ago,
cannot be excluded -- indicating some deficiencies in the control
measures.
The Irish BSE situation has been briefly referred to in ProMED-mail's
