With fear of scrub typhus in monsoons in the backdrop of 37 deaths reported from the state in 2016, the National Health Mission (NHM) has sent advisories to different districts to review the arrangements.

There is a plan to mobilize health staff clean premises of all the health institutions and hospitals across the state in July to maintain hygienic conditions in rainy season. The schools in the state have also been asked to disseminate information on the 3 diseases and the precautions to be taken in the morning assemblies.

"All the Chief Medical Officers have been called for review meeting in Shimla on [Wed 28 Jun 2017] to take stock of preparations for scrub typhus, dengue and chicken guinea," said NHM Mission Director, Pankaj Rai.

Talking to media persons, Rai, who was accompanied by senior doctors from the NHM, said 27 cases of scrub typhus have been reported so far [in] 2017.
The peak season for the disease, however, is from July to November. "Twenty eight persons died of scrub typhus in HP [Himachal Pradesh] in 2015, and 37 in 2016. There is no death reported so far in 2017," he said.

Scrub typhus is a mite-borne disease, spread by rats.

"The people, who work on the grass and agriculture fields have more chances of getting the disease, although it can affect anyone who visits the grassy fields. Anyone who gets a high grade fever should see a doctor in the government health institutions and take the prescribed medicine," he said.

Rai said proper Information Education and Communication (IEC) is being done across Himachal Pradesh for scrub typhus, dengue and chicken guinea.

He said the dirty water clogged around the houses, in fields or near the localities, may lead to dengue and the people need to take precautions in this regard.

Rai told the people to call up on 104 toll free number if there was any complaint about the services in the hospitals on these diseases.

"I joined a few months back in NHM and have found that not many people are using this phone number. We will popularize the service and upgrade the number, wherein all the complaints are forwarded to health institutions," he said.

The MD said he also had plans to display the list of the 56 free drugs being given in the government hospitals.
