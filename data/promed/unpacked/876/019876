Cases of hepatitis A infection are still increasing in Altamira
municipality [Tamaulipas state]. Now there are 28 infected children
from 10 schools, and the epidemiological barrier now encompasses 20
communities.

Ms Irma Leticia Torres, head of Education Services in Altamira
municipality, declared that the problem is still active, and now it
has extended to 10 municipal schools including Ejido Medrano and
Aurora Cruz de Mora elementary schools, and Rodolfo Torre-Cantu
kindergarten in Los Presidentes community.

Ms Torres announced that there are 28 infected children, so
authorities requested food handlers in schools that offer breakfast
for their students to be very careful. She also explained that the
cases the local educational authorities are aware of are those
reported by schoolmasters.

Ms Torres also said that schoolmasters from different institutions
received special directions with respect to preventive measures,
particularly with regard to surveillance for infected children. From
this week onwards, children will be checked by teachers in order to
detect the presence of symptoms compatible with hepatitis [A virus
infection] or any other communicable disease.

"We are trying to implement preventive measures as we already have
infectious diseases foci and we will enforce these measures so this
situation will not turn into an epidemic", Ms Torres stated.

Special care will be taken with children participating in the 'Mi
Desayuno' ('My Breakfast') program, and they will be supervised by
COEPRIS (Mexican Federal Commission for Protection Against Sanitary
Risks) in order to verify food handling is properly done and that
persons working in kitchens have all their sanitary authorization
documents in order.

Meanwhile, Mr Rigoberto Silva-Maya officer in charge of the Health
Commission, declared that the epidemiologic barrier had to be widened
to 20 communities, compared to last week [week of 7 Nov 2011] when
only 3 communities were included. He noted that, according to the
increase in the number of cases, 3500 persons living in the north
central parts of Altamira municipality may be at risk of contracting
hepatitis [A virus infection].

[Altamira is a municipality and city in the Mexican state of
Tamaulipas. It is located immediately to the north of the
municipalities of Tampico and Ciudad Madero, at the southern tip of
the state of Tamaulipas, on the Gulf of Mexico. Its location is shown
in the maps at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altamira_Municipality,_Tamaulipas and
http://healthmap.org/r/1rvO.

Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease that can cause mild to severe
illness. It is spread by faecal-oral transmission when a person
ingests food or drink contaminated by an infected person's faeces. The
disease is closely associated with poor sanitation and a lack of
personal hygiene. Blood borne transmission of hepatitis A virus
infection occurs but is much less common. Waterborne outbreaks, though
infrequent, are usually associated with sewage-contaminated or
inadequately treated water. Casual contact among people does not
spread the virus.

It is unclear from the press report above whether the cases of
hepatitis A virus infection affecting children attending separate
schools in Altamira are a consequence of waterborne or foodborne
transmission of infection. Some of the affected children may be
participating in communal meal programmes, which may increase the risk
of foodborne transmission. - Mod.CP]
