Abstract
--------
Background
Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has been considered to only infect avian species. However, one paramyxovirus named as Xiny10 was isolated from swine. The differences of Xiny10, another previous swine NDV (JL01) and vaccine strain La Sota were compared on the basis of sequences of the whole-lengthen fusion (F) gene and biological characteristics.

Findings
Through serologic tests and sequence alignment, Xiny10 was proved as NDV. It has great differences with JL01 in virulence, biological characteristics, genotype, and amino acid homology of F gene. The sequence alignment showed Xiny10 and La Sota both belonged to genotype II. It shared 97.3 to 98.7 per cent identities with genotype II NDVs, which was higher than these strains from the other genotypes.

Conclusions
These data above suggested that the swine virus was NDV and it might be generated from La Sota.

Discussion
We confirmed the paramyxovirus isolate Xiny10 from swine was NDV. Furthermore, it was obtained from one area where swine and poultry mixed for breeding. It had a high amino acid homology with vaccine La Sota. In addition, Xiny10 and La Sota owned the same 12 conserved cysteine residues and 6 potential glycosylation sites, which may affect viral structure and antigenicity. Additionally, Xiny10 revealed the higher amino acid homology with the field strains from different hosts of genotype II. These data suggested that the swine virus might be generated from La Sota because it has been widely used as a live virus vaccine until now in China.

[Newcastle disease (NCD, avian paramyxovirus-1 infection), an OIE-listed, highly infectious disease, affects birds with a wide range of clinical signs from mild to severe. Although the most significant impact of NCD is on chickens, other species can also be affected. Some pet and zoo birds become ill after infection, while other species can carry and shed virulent viruses asymptomatically. These birds, particularly illegally imported psittacines, can introduce NCD viruses to disease-free countries. Since the late 1990s, novel strains have caused outbreaks among geese (a species that is usually resistant to disease) in China. Infections may sporadically occur in humans (primarily causing conjunctivitis and mild flu-like symptoms). Previous to the current report, NCD virus has not been reported in other species of mammals. However Newcastle disease virus has been demonstrated to possess significant oncolytic activity against mammalian cancers and may feature in the future development of novel oncolytic agents through the use of genetic engineering (Palese P, Zamarin D. Future Microbiol. 2012 Mar; 7(3): 347-6).

According to the details included in the paper above, Xiny10 was isolated during 2010, in Henan province of China, from one sick swine whose clinical signs were characterized by progressive weight loss, fever and diarrhea, in a group of post-weaned pigs of about 9 weeks of age. It will be interesting to note if other animals in the unit showed similar disease, if other possible pathogens were excluded and if serological investigations could be undertaken. Experimental animal infection trials may be required to decide if Xiny10 causes clinical disease in swine. Its zoonotic potential also deserves to be considered. - Mods.AS/CP
