Australia

Summary

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 Melbourne area, VICTORIA
Date of start of the outbreak 25/01/2012
Outbreak status Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit Farm
Species Birds
Susceptible 24500
Cases
Deaths
Destroyed 24500
Slaughtered 0

Affected Population: The epidemiological unit is a duck grower farm
and associated breeding facility in the Melbourne area. Low pathogenic notifiable avian influenza subtype H5 was detected during routine surveillance from a healthy flock.

Epidemiology:Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or
inconclusive.

Epidemiological comments: H5 LPAI confirmed by Victorian Department of Primary Industries (DPI) and sequencing at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory. N1 has been ruled out on N1-specific PCR. Virus isolation and characterisation is being conducted.

The outbreak was confirmed on the index duck meat grower farm. Due to close commercial links with a second duck breeding farm, the second farm has also been designated as infected premises being part of the same epidemiological unit.

Notes by the OIE Animal Health Information Department:
- Since this is the first time that LPAI is identified in poultry in the history of the country, the reason for notification as first occurrence applies to the country but the event is in fact circumscribed to a small area as shown on the map.


- H5 and H7 avian influenza in its low pathogenic form in poultry is a notifiable disease as per Chapter 10.4. on avian influenza of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2011).

Control measures

Measures applied: Stamping out; Quarantine; Movement control inside the country; Screening; Zoning; Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); Vaccination prohibited; No treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: No other measures

[Since this is the first time low pathogenic Avian Influenza has been identified in Australia, the timely reporting is helpful in the prevention of further spread. It is also worth noting that even though this is first identification of the virus, the affected birds were not showing clinical signs. Two further pieces of information will be helpful, the Influenza subtype and the source of the infection. The information on subtype will likely be following in an OIE update, but we often don't really understand
where the disease comes as I suspect may be the case in this instance. - Mod. PC]
