On Christmas Eve, 200 shoppers and employees at a department store in Palm
Desert were herded into the parking lot, ordered to take their clothes off
and rinsed with a bleach solution after somebody called in an anthrax
threat. The call turned out to be a hoax, one of more than a dozen empty
threats made by telephone or mail and aimed at schools, courthouses, even a
nightclub in Southern California this holiday season by pranksters claiming
to have released the deadly bacteria.
"Anthrax has really taken off nationwide," said John Hoos, spokesman for
the FBI in Los Angeles. "We don't know why, but it's one of those sexy
terms of the '90s." Nationwide, the FBI has investigated more than two
dozen anthrax threats in recent months.
Authorities say each threat has to be taken seriously. As a result, the
hoaxes are racking up millions of dollars in expenses and causing officials
to worry that more pressing needs are being pushed aside. Authorities in
Los Angeles said one positive result is that the scares are teaching them
how to determine quickly whether a threat is real, making them less likely
to empty entire buildings -- and denying pranksters the thrill of creating
chaos.
"The longer you take in your response, it seems to encourage those doing
the hoax," said Laurene Mascola, chief of communicable-disease control for
the Los Angeles Health Department. "We're feeling more and more comfortable
with our assessment tools."
Similarly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using the
scares to help develop the nation's first comprehensive guide for public
health agencies dealing with potential biological or chemical terrorism.
The CDC is spending $120 million on the project.
No one knows why anthrax is the threat of the moment. Some speculate it's
the influence of movies and books such as "Outbreak" and "The Hot Zone,"
which are about biological disasters. Others note that biological and
chemical warfare has been in the news lately: Saddam Hussein is accused of
developing chemical weapons, and the Pentagon announced this year it would
inoculate troops against anthrax.
Making a terrorist threat -- even if it is an empty threat -- can bring up
to 10 years in prison.
