There were 22 human anthrax cases in Georgia during this year [2010].
According to the news agency "Rosbalt" the latest anthrax case was
registered a day before and only a week ago [week of 4-8 Oct 2010] a
patient died from anthrax. However, the specialists consider that
there is no ongoing epidemic and there are sporadic cases only.

[The Georgian National CDC has provided the following information on
the 22nd case of anthrax in the country this year (2010). The patient
is a 54-year-old man from Gardabani region, who contracted the
infection while slaughtering his cow. His condition is of moderate
severity. - Corr.BA]

[While the reported livestock cases each year are few, but across all
species except pigs, the human cases are out of proportion indicating
that this is an anthropocentric reporting system, typical of the old
Soviet states; i.e., livestock deaths without human cases are
probably not investigated.

For example the bovine outbreaks reported since 1999 (blank), 2000
(3), 2001 (3), 2002 (0), 2003 (0), 2004 (6), 2005 (3), 2006 (3), 2007
(4), 2008 (7), 2009 (10), the human cases reported each year were
1999 (51), 2000 (29), 2001 (26), 2002 (15), 2003 (27), 2004 (45),
2005 (19), 2006 (38), 2007 (42), 2008 (62), 2009 (38). If the
vaccination is then reactive in relation to the human cases, the
disease is essentially expensively uncontrolled. - Mod.MHJ]
