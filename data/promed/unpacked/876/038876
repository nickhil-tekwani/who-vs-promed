Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus - update 31 May 2013
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia has notified WHO of an additional laboratory-confirmed case with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

The patient is a 61 year old man with underlying medical conditions who became ill on 20 May 2013. The patient is from Al-Ahsa. Additionally, 3 patients earlier reported from Al-Ahsa have died. The government is continuing to investigate the outbreaks in the country.

Globally, from September 2012 to [31 May 2013], WHO has been informed of a total of 50 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 30 deaths.

WHO has received reports of laboratory-confirmed cases originating in the following countries in the Middle East to date: Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). France, Germany, Tunisia, and the United Kingdom also reported laboratory confirmed cases; they were either transferred there for care of the disease or returned from the Middle East and subsequently became ill. In France, Tunisia, and the United Kingdom, there has been limited local transmission among patients who had not been to the Middle East but had been in close contact with the laboratory confirmed or probable cases.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all member states to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhoea, in patients who are immunocompromised.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.

All member states are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions. WHO continues to closely monitor the situation.

ProMED-mail rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[The report above confirms the information provided by the Ministry of Public Health of Saudi Arabia, with a global total of 50 cases of MERS-CoV respiratory illness including 30 deaths as of 31 May 2013 (up from 49 cases with 27 deaths in the prior WHO update (see <MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (13): Saudi Arabia, WHO 20130530.1745063>.

Of interest is a map on the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Public Health website showing the locations of cases of MERS-CoV identified in Saudi Arabia as of 31 May 2012, available at http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/HealthAwareness/Corona/Pages/AboutCorona.aspx. According to the Saudi Ministry of Public Health, there have been 38 cases in Saudi Arabia including 21 deaths. - Mod.MPP]

Italy reported its 1st case of the SARS-like coronavirus on Friday [31 May 2013], a 45 year old man who had been travelling in Jordan, the health ministry said.

The patient was in good condition and was being monitored in isolation, the ministry said in a statement. He was admitted to a hospital in Tuscany with a high fever, a cough, and breathing difficulties. A resident of Italy with foreign nationality, the man recently spent 40 days in Jordan where one of his sons was suffering from an unspecified flu.

Saudi Arabia has been the most affected by the virus, with 39 cases and 25 deaths so far, according to data from the World Health Organization [38 cases and 21 deaths according to the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health].

The virus, which can cause coughing, fever, and pneumonia, has spread from the Gulf to France, Britain, and Germany. [It has been named] the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It is from the same viral family that triggered the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that swept the world in late 2003 and killed 775 people.

[The official report from the Ministry of Health, Italy can be found at http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/news/p3_2_4_1_1.jsp?lingua=italiano&menu=salastampa&p=comunicatistampa&id=3962. This announcement contains similar information from the newswire above. This now increases the number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV to 51, including 30 deaths. It is the 1st case diagnosed in Italy, and the 3rd laboratory confirmed case to have had exposure in Jordan. Information on the status of this patient's son, and results of investigations surrounding the son's illness would be greatly appreciated.

As a reminder, the 1st laboratory confirmed cluster occurred in Jordan in April 2012, although it was not confirmed at the time of the cluster, but rather in November 2012, as a retrospective testing of saved specimens from an undiagnosed outbreak involving an intensive care unit (ICU) in a hospital.

[3] Jordan: MERS-CoV surveillance, MOH
Date: Fri 31 May 2013
From: Najwa Khuri-Bulos <najwa.khuri@gmail.com> [edited]


Following discovery that the 2 patients who died with a mysterious respiratory illness in April 2012 in Zarqa Jordan were due to the novel coronavirus, now renamed MERS-CoV, Jordan has been conducting an epidemiological investigation to determine the extent of the infection among the contacts of the cases and other epidemiologically linked cases using serological testing for MERS-CoV. (Note that virus was identified from lower respiratory samples in one of the 2 patients who died and in the blood stream in the other)

Since it is now known that upper respiratory samples may be less sensitive for viral detection than lower respiratory tract samples, contacts and clinical cases are being serologically tested. The results of this survey should be available in the coming weeks and will help determine the extent of the outbreak in that city. In addition testing for MERS-CoV has been done in 3 sentinel centers as part of the ongoing SARI surveillance and thus far more than 500 samples have been tested and found to be negative.

Even though no other cases of MERS-CoV were detected since the original outbreak in the health facility in Zarqa, the recent outbreaks in health facilities in Saudi Arabia, renewed interest in this virus in Jordan. A high level meeting headed by the Jordan minister of health along with the outbreak committee was convened in the past week. The committee includes members of the different health providers in Jordan and is charged with drawing up plans for clinical management, infection control, laboratory investigation, and surveillance for MERS-CoV. This preparedness plan is being activated due to the recognition that while there are many unknown answers about the spread, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of the new virus, the possibility that this may spread is real due to the anticipated increased crowding and visitation to Saudi Arabia in the Umrah [pilgrimage] and Hajj in the coming few months; the threat of an increase in the number of cases is ever present. Several other related studies on the subject are also being done by the teams in the different hospitals including the Jordan University Hospital where a team of infectious disease and pulmonologists are activating the preparedness plan for that facility and are interested in being part of regional efforts to study this subject further.

Moroccan Ministry of Health: there is no coronavirus infection in Morocco
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The head of the Health Ministry denied the existence of coronavirus infection [MERS-CoV] in Morocco.

A statement issued by the "Moroccan Network for the Defense of Health" had revealed the 1st case of coronavirus [MERS-CoV] in a citizen of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) who was on a tour in Morocco and was admitted to the Sheikh Zayed Hospital in Rabat on Wednesday [29 May 2013].

The minister stated on Thursday morning, 30 May 2013 in a telephone interview, that specimens taken to identify MERS-CoV were negative for the virus. The patient had respiratory symptoms. These studies were validated by the Pasteur Laboratory.

[It appears as though the press report on this incident, a suspected case of MERS-CoV in an individual from the UAE touring in Morocco was erroneous -- the press presented this as a confirmed case in the initial reports. Laboratory testing of specimens (presumably lower respiratory as recommended) by the Pasteur Institute have come back as negative for infection with the MERS-CoV.

ProMED-mail apologizes for this error in posting. Given the heightened sensitivity facing a new pathogen where the source of infection is as yet unknown, we have seen this leading to rapid communications of suspected cases in the media, but erroneously presented as confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]
