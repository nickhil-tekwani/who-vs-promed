China: outbreak of hepatitis A in Guangdong Province
----------------------------------------------------
In recent days there has been an outbreak of hepatitis A in the town of
Gongping, Haifeng County, Guangdong Province. The local government says
that containment measures undertaken by all levels of administration in the
province have controlled the outbreak and it has not spread to nearby rural
areas.
Shanwei City government yesterday issued a notice requiring all levels to
be on the alert and closely guard [against the disease]. On 23 Oct 2003,
when workers from the Haifeng County Disease Control Center opened a legal
infectious disease survey, they discovered case[s] of hepatitis A and
immediately reported them to their superiors. That afternoon the county
[issued] a circular on the outbreak. Currently, the township has
definitively diagnosed 29 cases of hepatitis A with 31 other suspected
cases. Of the confirmed cases, 4 have already left the hospital, 17 are
still in hospital, and 8 are in recovery. The infection rate among youth is
reported to be relatively high in this outbreak, accounting for 23 cases.
After initial analysis, experts suspect the source of infection is a cold
drink known as "Qingwa Luan" ("frog egg"). After the outbreak, the
provincial Disease Control Center twice sent experts to Gongping to provide
guidance on disease control work and to help find the source. Related
departments in the province urgently dispatched 20 000 units of
gamma-globulin to Gongping County, and city disease control center staff
rushed to the scene to begin containment work. Gongping adopted active
containment measures and conducted numerous hygiene campaigns. More than
1000 people were put into action to form specialized sterilization "small
groups" going deeply into village (residential) committees, markets,
administrative organs, factories, and scattered "hygiene dead corners" [any
offers to interpret this? - Mod.SH] all over to conduct disinfection; put
into place responsible pursuit of treatment; [enact] responsibility from
local village (residential) committees in the patients' [places of
residence]; strengthen disinfection at the water treatment plants, conduct
health checks of workers; eradicate the infectious source; organize
departments at all levels to form supervisory groups; clean and reorganize
drink stalls on the market; and use all types of media to promulgate
scientific ways to prevent hepatitis A in order to dispel fears among the
public.
To prevent expansion of the outbreak, from 28 Oct 2003, city supervisory
departments conducted 3 days of continuous inspections of hygiene
supervision in the cafeterias of schools, factories, and mines, hotels and
restaurants, and other places where people gather to dine.

[The extent and variety of the infection control measures seem
disproportionate to an outbreak of infection supposedly related to
consumption of a single variety of cold drink, unless there is general
contamination of the public water supply. More information would be
appreciated. - Mod.CP]
