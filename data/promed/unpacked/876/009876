Nearly 500 thoroughbreds in training at Payson Park Thoroughbred Training Center in Indiantown, Florida, will be quarantined for 3 weeks after a horse tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 [EHV-1] on 29 Feb 2016.

Payson Park general manager Mary Gallagher said the 21-day quarantine begins today, 1 Mar 2016, for all horses on the grounds. Under that quarantine, the estimated 480 thoroughbreds in training at Payson Park will be able to continue to exercise but will not be able to leave the grounds. No new horses will be allowed to enter the property.

Gallagher said 1 Mar 2016 that state regulatory veterinarians have been on the grounds since yesterday [29 Feb 2016]. She also noted that the horse in question was moved from her barn to a quarantine barn immediately after she showed signs of lethargy. Blood tests came back positive 29 Feb 2016 for EHV-1.

"We had moved the horse just based on the fact that she was lethargic. At that point 2 of our vets here got involved and did the blood work and necessary procedures," Gallagher said. "She was placed in our quarantine barn at the end of our property so that's when we found out it was a positive and immediately we took up with the state about what we needed to do next."

In a series of Tweets, trainer Christophe Clement acknowledged the quarantine and Payson Park's efforts to handle the situation.

Besides Clement, other trainers with horses at Payson Park include Bill Mott, Shug McGaughey, and Roger Attfield among many others. Gallagher credited Payson Park trainers with their efforts to assist with the protocol.

"They've given us our instructions and we're following them to the 'T,'" Gallagher said. "We'd already jumped on it ourselves with every precautionary measure we could possibly think of then we waited from orders from the state, which we've followed explicitly."

Gulfstream Park and Tampa Bay Downs both announced Tuesday [1 Mar 2016] that they would not allow shippers from Payson Park.

The Equine Disease Communication Center said the horse had been imported from Virginia and traveled with additional horses that off loaded in South Carolina. Both Virginia and South Carolina have been notified and placed these premises under quarantine.

[It is entirely possible (probable?) that we will be hearing of outbreaks soon in Virginia and South Carolina. With the quick responses of these people, it may be possible, hopefully, that no others horses will be impacted.

Everyone at the track should be taking temperatures of every horse at least twice daily and maintaining a chart of those temperatures to note the slightest rise, as that may be the earliest sign of trouble. - Mod.TG
