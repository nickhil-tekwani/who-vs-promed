The GIDEON software notes that the last indigenous case of human rabies
in the U.K. occurred in 1902. 8 'imported' cases were registered during
1977 to 1990 (from Indian, Pakistan, Cambodia and Bangladesh). No rabid
bats were reported during 1970 to 1995.
A rabid insectivorous bat was trapped in Newhaven in May 1996 - 4 human
contacts have received prophylaxis.

In response to the query about bat rabies, I can forward the following
information to the list.
A "News Release" from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food (MAFF),
dated 7 June 1996, reads as follows:
"SUSPECTED CASE OF RABIES IN A BAT. MAFF is investigating the possibility
that a dead bat may have had rabies. Preliminary results which became
available yesterday, indicates this may be the case. Three further tests need
to be carried out and are underway. Final results will be known in 21 days.
"Two people have been in close contact with the bat since 30 May...
"No confirmed cases [of rabies] have previously been found in bats in
Britain..."
CDR Weekly, published by the UK Public Health Laboratory Service
Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (PHLS CDSC), Vol 6, No 24, dated 14
June 1996 - after more facts had come to light - continues the story:
"BAT BRINGS RABIES TO BRITAIN. Four people in the vicinity of Newhaven, on
with an insectivorous bat with rabies...
"MAFF routinely monitors reports of suspected rabies in mammals, including
bats... but no cases have been found in Great Britain outside quarantine
since 1970, and none among the 1800 bats tested since 1987...
"Three human deaths in Europe in the past 30 years are known to have been
associated with bat rabies, one in Finland and two in the former Soviet
Union. Bat rabies in Europe is mainly confined to serotine bats,
particularly in Holland, northern Germany, and Denmark. Serotine bats are
relatively uncommon in Britain. There is no evidence that species of bats
common in Britain carry rabies to a significant extent elsewhere and,
although the rabies virus carried by bats can infect and kill humans and has
killed laboratory rodents, there is no evidence that it can be passed from
one terrestrial mammal to another in nature.
"In the United States four cases of human rabies were reported in 1995,
caused by different variants of rabies viruses associated with insectivorous
bats, but without definite histories of bites. Bat bites are small and may
go unnoticed, but these cases suggest that limited physical contact with a
rabid bat may be associated with transmission."
More details of the US cases are reported in MMWR 1996;45:353-6.

Briefing sent to all bat groups by The Bat Conservation Trust

Bats and rabies

The Ministry of Agriculture has recorded a case of rabies in a bat in
Britain. This arose from a bat that was found grounded in Newhaven and
taken to a member of the Sussex bat group for care. The bat behaved in an
uncharacteristic way and bit the handler. A few days later the bat was put
down and the corpse sent to the MAFF veterinary laboratory for routine
rabies testing as part of their continuing surveillance. Tests for rabies,
including a fluorescent antibody test and other tests, gave a positive
result. More specific tests to characterise the virus are currently in
progress and will take some time to complete. At present the bat is believed
to be a Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii). The person who was bitten and
another who handled the bat are receiving post-exposure anti-rabies
treatment as a precaution. Both are well.

It has been known for some years that rabies-related viruses, known as
European bat lyssavirus (EBLV), exist in bats in Europe. The species most
commonly involved is the serotine, Eptesicus serotinus, though small numbers
of other species, including Daubenton's bat, have also been recorded as
positive. This strain of bat rabies is distinct from the sylvatic rabies
that infects other mammals (notably foxes, cats and dogs) and has never been
recorded from any animal other than a bat. It seems that there is no
interchange of the virus between bats and other animals. Thus a bat with
EBLV is not considered to be a route for rabies to spread into foxes or
other wildlife in Britain. The situation is quite different in the USA and
Central America, where the type of rabies found both in bats and in the main
terrestrial carriers, raccoons and foxes, is sylvatic rabies.

Since 1987, when it became apparent that bat-rabies was reasonably
widespread in serotines on the western seaboard of continental Europe
(Denmark, Germany, The Netherlands), the Ministry has maintained
surveillance for the disease by testing bat corpses sent in by bat workers.
Until the recent case came to light, over 1800 bats had been tested with no
positive results. This suggests strongly that bat-rabies is not endemic
(normally-occurring) in bats in Britain.

Although the origin of the Newhaven bat is unknown, there is a possibility
that it might have originated on continental Europe as it was found in a
disabled state close to a port, in an area where bat detector surveys have
failed to find any Daubenton's bats. It is quite possible that this bat
could have flown across the Channel or it may have been imported on a ship.
Both these routes have been recorded in the past.

Public health

The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food has issued the following guidance:

1. There is no risk to the public provided they do not touch or pick up bats.

2. Bats, especially sick or apparently injured bats, should not be picked
up. Anyone bitten or scratched by a bat should seek immediate medical
attention. If the bat involved can be caught, it should be sent
immediately for rabies testing via the nearest office of the Ministry.

3. Persons working with bats who are bitten should receive post-exposure
prophylactic rabies treatment.

This advice is very much in line with advice which has been given by bat
conservationists in the past. We have always advised that everyone should
avoid being bitten by any wild animal as they may carry a range of diseases.
Prophylactic (pre-exposure) rabies vaccination has been available to bat
workers for some years, but the general consensus has been that it is
probably only necessary for those who work with the larger species of bats
and handle significant numbers of bats. With the Newhaven bat proving
rabies-positive, we are currently re-examining this advice. In the meantime,
bat workers should take particular care not to be bitten and send any bats
that appear to be sick or behave uncharacteristically to the MAFF for
testing. If anyone is bitten, they should consider having post-exposure
rabies treatment.

Bat conservation

There is, of course, concern that there may be an anti-bat backlash because
of the massive publicity given to this case. Both ourselves and the Ministry
emphasise that bats are protected by law and there is no danger arising from
having a bat roost in one's house roof.

The current situation is that further tests are being carried out on the
Newhaven bat and its origins are being investigated. It is likely that the
level of disease surveillance will be increased by MAFF, so we will have
more information about whether this was an isolated incident arising from an
imported bat (in which case no significant change to our current advice is
necessary) or whether EBLV does occur in the UK. Given the large number of
bats already tested, the probability is that this was an isolated incident.

Experience in other European countries where bat-rabies is recorded makes it
clear that the only situation in which members of the public may be at risk
is if they pick up a sick bat and are bitten. There is no suggestion that
bats with rabies will attack humans or other animals or bite unless
provoked. Similarly, there is no evidence that bats are carriers of rabies
(i.e. that they can have the virus without dying from it). On the continent
of Europe, many people live with the full knowledge that bats occupying
their roof are, or have been, infected with a rabies-related virus.

Every effort must be made to reassure roost owners that there is no extra
risk attached to having bats in the roof. The probability of finding a sick
bat is no greater for roost owners than for anyone else and the great
majority of roost owners never come into contact with their bats. Perhaps a
pertinent question is to ask concerned roost owners how often they have
picked up a bat.

The above notes have been prepared in discussion with Tony Mitchell-Jones,
of English Nature. Tony Hutson of BCT has been fully involved with the
incident since the beginning and expects to remain in close contact with all
authorities concerned. He has also been involved in preliminary field
assessment to assess the occurrence of Daubenton's bat in the area.

It is likely that further field work will be required and possibly sampling
will be pursued. We expect to be advising and possibly participating in
this work. We hope we can rely on the full co-operation from any bat groups
that may be asked to be involved in programmes of work that are approved by
BCT. To some extent this programme of work is determined by the particular
strain of virus involved as soon as that is identified.

We are also discussing any required revised advice on all matters concerned
with the taking of bats into captivity, the delivery of dead or suspect bats
to MAFF and on re-release.

Vaccination is available free through your local doctor. The vaccination is
available from the Public Health Laboratory Service, Central Public Health
Laboratory, Virus Reference Division, 61 Colindale Avenue, London NW9 5HT
(Telephone 0181 200 4400). The head of the Division is Dr. David Brown.

That this incidence concerns a Daubenton's bat is surprising. There are
only four instances of bat-related viruses in Daubenton's bat in Europe
(Denmark '86, '87; Germany '86, Switzerland '92). 22 have been tested in
UK, and 89 in The Netherlands: all negative.
