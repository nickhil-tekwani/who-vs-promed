Washington state health officials say a salmonellosis outbreak linked to pork products has grown to 134 cases in 10 counties. Early tests show a connection to a slaughter facility in Graham, Washington. The federal CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] has joined the state health department in its investigation into the outbreak. People eating pork are advised to cook it thoroughly.

Most of the illnesses -- 84 cases -- were in King County, while 24 cases were found in Snohomish county, 12 in Pierce County and 5 in Yakima County. Health officials say exposure for many of the people who became ill was whole roasted pigs served at private events and restaurants. Samples were collected at Kapowsin Meats slaughter facility in Graham last week, the state Department of Health said. "Testing confirms the outbreak strain was present," it added.

The business, which is regulated by the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, has cooperated with the investigation. There may be other sources, the state health department said, and disease investigators are searching for the origin of the bacterium in the outbreak.

[The number of reported cases has again increased substantially.

The outbreak strain is _Salmonella_ I, 4, 5, 12:i: -, a designation discussed by Ana Paccagnella (supervisor of the Enteric Bacteriology Section at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control) at http://www.bcfpa.net/Attachments/Presentations/Conference2005/Naming%20Salmonella%20(A%20Paccagnella)%2008%20Nov%2005.pdf.

_Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are those usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.

The designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:
- the "I" reflects subspecies _enterica_;
- the "4, 12" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. It should be noted that serotype Typhimurium carries somatic antigens 4, 5 and 12 (the Group B antigens). Paccagnella pointed out to me in an email that an O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not.
- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i: 1,2, reflects the flagellar or H antigens. It is these H antigens that define the serotype identity within an individual group of salmonellae.

Almost all of these organisms are biphasic in regard to the H antigens, that is, they can switch from one flagellar antigen to another; as an example, _S._ Typhimurium is I 4, 5, 12:i:1,2. - Mod.LL
