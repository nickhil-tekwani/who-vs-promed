[1] Israel: Rapid saliva-based test
Date: Thu 13 Aug 2020 10:21 IDT
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-israel-detection/israeli-hospital-trials-super-quick-saliva-test-for-covid-19-idUSKCN25923A


A newly developed saliva test aims to determine in less than a second whether you are infected with the novel coronavirus, Israel's largest medical center said on Thursday [13 Aug 2020]. Patients rinse their mouth with a saline wash and spit into a vial. This is then examined by a small spectral device that, in simple terms, shines light on the specimen and analyses the reaction to see if it is consistent with COVID-19. With machine learning, it gets more accurate over time.

Eli Schwartz of the Center for Geographic Medicine and Tropical Diseases at Sheba Medical Center, who is leading the trial, said it was easier to use than PCR swabs commonly used to detect COVID-19. "So far we have very promising results in this new method, which will be much more convenient and much cheaper," he said.

The center said in an initial clinical trial involving hundreds of patients, the new artificial intelligence-based device identified evidence of the virus in the body at a 95% success rate.

Amos Panet, an expert in molecular virology at Jerusalem's Hebrew University, said he would like to see more data and comparisons with existing tests before making a final judgment. The amount of virus present in saliva increases as patients get sicker, he said, and a big challenge is to detect in "people who are borderline." "It will be a game changer only if we see validation of this technology against the current technology," he said.

Sheba, located just outside Tel Aviv, has partnered with the device's developer, Israeli firm Newsight Imaging, to bring the system to market. The company said they are in the process of getting regulatory approval. Each test costs less than 25 cents and it expects the device will eventually cost less than USD 200.

[A rapid point-of-service detector with high sensitivity and specificity is sorely needed. The delays in reporting test results in many locations have made many testing initiatives historical rather than practical from a public health perspective. This will also need to be evaluated with respect to asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections, as the goal of testing is to accurately identify infected individuals who can be contributing to spread of the SARS-CoV-2 in the community and to known contacts. If I could put an emoji in this post, I'd use a "fingers crossed" emoji, as we know many a "perfect" idea doesn't always survive rigorous testing. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Commentary on publications

From: Steve Berger <steve@gideononline.com> [edited]


COVID-19 publishing anomaly
---------------------------
An unfortunate side effect of the COVID-19 pandemic has been an explosion of professional publications dealing with every possible aspect of the disease. Innumerable studies dissect the clinical features, epidemiology, imaging characteristics, and risk factors of patient cohorts treated in hospitals or clinics.

The GIDEON database collates all case series dealing with COVID-19 that have been cited in PubMed. These charts do not include drug trials and disease prevalence surveys. A total of 1316 relevant series had been cited by PubMed as of 13 Aug 2020, published from 55 (28.2%) endemic countries and dependencies. Of these, 711 were published from China, encompassing 185 280 individual patients. The total number of COVID-19 cases reported by China to that date was 84 756. In other words, 2.19 Chinese patients have appeared in published case series for every 1 patient who is actually reported!

China alone accounts for 54.0% of all published case series, despite the fact that only 0.041% of the world's cases have been reported by that country. In part, these numbers might reflect the fact that "publishable data" were already accumulating in China before significant numbers were reported elsewhere, or delays that might be inherent in the publishing cycle itself. Other factors could include the relative numbers of clinical staff and institutions involved in research and publishing from individual countries. Nevertheless, the unusually high number of case studies reported by China is difficult to explain. Assuming that "double publication" can be discounted, large groups of patients are clearly "recycled" through multiple studies. From an epidemiological standpoint, this practice could contribute to the quality of data because multiple studies of a given patient cohort can serve as excellent control groups for one another.

In the following bar graph, I've contrasted the ratio of published case series per reported cases among high-incidence countries. A pie graph contrasting the relative proportion of total case series from individual countries is also presented. See graphs at https://www.gideononline.com/2020/08/14/covid-19-publishing-trends/.

[As always, Steve and the Gideon database provide some very interesting observations based on data analyses. I do suspect that as periods of calm return to medical centers in areas with case surges there will be more publications from elsewhere. - Mod.MPP]

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences and more widespread community-based transmission.

South Korea looks like major transmission is beginning. Previously when there were major events, time-limited increased restrictions were implemented. A key takeaway message is that the virus is still circulating globally and relaxing of the guard (eliminating simple measures of social distancing, face masks, hand washing and large gatherings) is an open invitation for the virus to re-enter with clusters of cases and ultimately community transmission. - Mod.MPP]

[4] WHO situation report 207 (as of 14 Aug 2020)
Date: Fri 14 Aug 2020
Source: WHO [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200814-covid-19-sitrep-207.pdf?sfvrsn=2f2154e6_2


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 14 Aug 2020.

Highlights
----------
- As previously indicated (situation report 203), starting this coming Monday [17 Aug 2020], the daily situation report will be replaced by a "COVID-19 Weekly Epidemiological Update," which will focus on analysis and interpretation of the evolving epidemiological situation. All quantitative data will continue to be updated daily on the global COVID-19 dashboard, <covid19.who.int>. Important narrative updates will appear on the "Rolling updates" pages. Operational updates will continue to be shared through the "Weekly Operational Update on COVID-19."

- In many countries, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has incorporated lessons from other disease approaches, such as the work to protect communities against Ebola virus disease. In Nigeria's Niger Delta, health workers have unified their surveillance strategy to improve the detection and reporting of infectious diseases, such as measles, yellow fever, and COVID-19.

- Today's "Subject in Focus" highlights updated guidance on home care for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and the management of their contacts. The document provides guidance on the issues to be considered when deciding whether to provide care for COVID-19 patients at home and offers advice for health workers and caregivers providing that care.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 55.0% of the global newly reported cases and 66.6% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 11.1 million cases. The USA reported 35.5% of new cases (55 907), followed by Brazil 35.0% (55 155), Colombia 7.7% (12 066), Peru 5.6% (8875), Argentina 4.9% (7663), Mexico 3.7% (5858), and Chile 1.2% (1866).

- The European region reported 11.0% of the global newly reported cases and 5.7% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Spain reported 23.9% (7550) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Russia 16.0% (5065), France 8.0% (2515), Ukraine 5.5% (1732), Israel 5.1% (1612), Romania 4.6% (1454), Germany 4.6% (1449), Kazakhstan 4.5% (1410), Turkey 3.9% (1243), UK 0% (0), Poland 2.6% (811), Uzbekistan 2.3% (724), and Netherlands 1.8% (577). While Russia's proportional representation has fallen, its daily absolute count of newly confirmed cases is basically stable; it's the increased reporting from other countries that causes the decrease in representation of Russia.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.7% of the global newly reported cases and 5.1% of global newly reported fatalities. Iraq reported 28.7% (3841) of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 19.6% (2625), Saudi Arabia 11.1% (1482), Morocco 9.3% (1241), Kuwait 5.2% (701), Pakistan 4.6% (617), Bahrain 3.5% (462), Libya 3.3% (439), Palestinian Authority 3.2% (432), Qatar 2.6% (343), and Lebanon 2.2% (298). Cases are continuing to increase in Iraq and Morocco. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a relative surge mode.

- The African region reported 3.0% of the global newly reported cases and 5.2% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 45.6% (3946) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ethiopia 12.3% (1068), Kenya 7.5% (650), Algeria 5.6% (488), Nigeria 4.3% (373), Ghana 3.2% (275), Zambia 1.9% (162), Cameroon 1.9% (161), Malawi 1.8% (160), Senegal 1.8% (153), Namibia 1.6% (138), and Madagascar 1.4% (125).

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.9% of the global newly reported cases and 0.70% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 69.0% (3777) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 19.5% (1070), Australia 4.2% (231), South Korea 1.9% (103) and China 1.8% (99). The Philippines, Japan, and Australia continue to have elevated transmission, and Viet Nam continues to report cases in the wake of the Da Nang outbreak -- 28 reported in the past 24 hours.

- The South East Asia region reported 24.4% of the global newly reported cases and 16.7% of globally reported deaths. India reported 92.3% (64 553) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 3.7% (2617) and Indonesia 3.0% (2098). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region, and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries with resurgences associated with lifting of restrictions.

[The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (65 609), followed by USA (60 600), and Brazil (49 274) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (52.9%). There were 9662 deaths reported in the past 24 hours -- possibly includes delayed reports from yesterday (13 Aug 2020).

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed in the past 24 hours, followed by USA, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, South Africa, Philippines, Mexico, and Russia. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed goes from 5065 to 65 609. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Iraq, France, Bangladesh, UK, Iran, Indonesia, Venezuela, Chile, Ukraine, and Germany; their range of reported new cases is 1505 to 4013.

The Worldometer report shows a 20 000+ decrease in cases reported by Spain. Going back to the official report from Spain today (14 Aug 2020) in section [3F] above, there is no mention of new purging of the reports based on a review effective by 18:00 CET when the update was posted. So, there was either a post-18:00 CET revision OR a delay in Worldometer data collection, OR the previous revision with reduction of cases back on 11 May 2020 when only PCR and IgM results were accepted by Worldometer as a correction, OR the weekend reporting artifact led to reduced case reports.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is virtually no change in average number of daily reported cases (an increase of 0.76%), and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is decreased by 5.2%. The key question still remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether these figures reflect reporting artifact seen surrounding weekends. Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances (I haven't changed my mind! -- I feel like a broken record here...).

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases; however, I still wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing. For example, the USA reported data suggest a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases (see section [3E] above), but if one looks at the percentage of positive PCR tests, in the past 2 weeks the positivity rate has been stable at 9%, consistent with significant ongoing transmission that is not abating (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html). The most severely affected region is the Americas, with increasing daily case counts, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). India also drives the next most affected region -- South East Asia -- with persistent high daily case reports. - Mod.MPP]
