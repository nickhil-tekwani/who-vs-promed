Contaminated exam tools were to blame for an alarming outbreak of a drug-resistant superbug in Illinois last year [2013], government health officials reported Thursday [1 Jan 2014; CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Notes from the Field: New Delhi Metallo-Beta-Lactamase-Producing _Escherichia coli_ Associated with Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography -- Illinois, 2013. Weekly 3 Jan 2014 / 62(51): 1051; available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6251a4.htm?s_cid=mm6251a4_w.]

Endoscopes that use cameras attached to long tubes to snake through the gut, examining the liver, bile ducts, and pancreas, weren't properly disinfected and wound up infecting patients with a dangerous type of CRE, or carbapenem-resistant _Enterobacteriaceae_, a family of germs highly resistant to antibiotics.

These were rare NDM, or New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase, CRE cases, which produce an enzyme that renders most antibiotics useless, officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] said. When that happens, it can be difficult or impossible to treat life-threatening infections, experts say.

A CDC team looked at 9 cases of NDM CRE [that is, 9 patients with positive cultures for NDM-producing _Escherichia coli_ with greater than 85 percent similarity by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to the outbreak strain -- 8 clinical cultures and 1 rectal surveillance culture] in northeastern Illinois that occurred from March to July [2013], including 8 at a single hospital.

Health officials were worried that such cases have jumped sharply since 2009, when they were first reported in the US. From 2009 through 2012, 27 patients with NDM-producing CRE were confirmed by the CDC. But last year [2013], there were 69 cases, including 44 from northeastern Illinois alone, said Dr Alex Kallen, a CDC outbreak expert. "It was a little bit of a surprise," he said.

Even more surprising was that the germs were eventually traced to patients who had a history of endoscopic liver and pancreas exams known as ERCPs [that is, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography] [6 of 8 patients at the single Illinois hospital had a history of undergoing ERCP at the hospital] -- and then to dirty tools. It turns out that the endoscopes, which had undergone high-level disinfection, still tested positive for the NDM CRE [_E. coli_] and another bad bug, KPC [_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemase]-producing _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, also highly resistant to nearly all antibiotics. [The _E. coli_ isolate from the endoscope was highly related (more than 95 percent) to the outbreak strain by PFGE. Among 91 ERCP patients who were initially notified that they had potential exposure to a culture-positive endoscope, 50 returned for rectal surveillance cultures. NDM-producing _E. coli_ were recovered from 23 (46 percent).]

The CDC review found no lapses in cleaning technique on the part of hospital staff. They're not sure why the tools stayed dirty even after disinfection and think it may be a design flaw. Health officials are urging hospitals to make sure they're following proper protocol for cleaning tools to prevent more outbreaks of the drug-resistant superbugs. In the meantime, the Illinois hospital switched to a new sterilization procedure; no new cases have been reported since. [ERCP endoscope reprocessing was changed from automated high-level disinfection to gas sterilization with ethylene oxide.]

[Flexible endoscopes often acquire high levels of microbial contamination on their external surfaces and internal channels during each use and reports have documented transmission of microorganisms from patient to patient via contaminated endoscopes (http://www.asge.org/assets/0/71312/71314/52413d06aa4c4a27b3695ca09e1d5cec.pdf). Flexible endoscopes are complex instruments with intricate internal mechanisms that are often particularly difficult to disinfect. They are made of heat-sensitive materials and cannot be autoclaved. Manual meticulous cleaning must precede high-level disinfection, usually with glutaraldehyde, after each use to prevent transmission of infection (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/glutaraldehyde/ and http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/disinfection_sterilization/3_0disinfectequipment.html). High-level disinfection can be expected to destroy all microorganisms, although when high numbers of bacterial spores are present, a few spores might survive. The FDA definition of high-level disinfection is a sterilant used for a shorter contact time to achieve a 6-log10 kill of an appropriate _Mycobacterium_ species (http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/Disinfection_Sterilization/2_approach.html).

The main advantage to ethylene oxide is that it can sterilize heat- or moisture-sensitive medical equipment without deleterious effects on the material used in the medical devices. However, sterilization using ethylene oxide can be too time-consuming for routine use between patients (http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/Disinfection_Sterilization/table_6.html).
