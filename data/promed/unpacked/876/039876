The FAO Global Avian influenza virus, with zoonotic potential situation update is available at, https://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/Global_AIV_Zoonotic_Update/situation_update.html (last updated on 23 Feb 2022)

A map with the global distribution of avian influenza virus with zoonotic potential observed since 1 Oct 2021 (that is, the current wave) and as of 23 Feb 2022, is available at https://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/Global_AIV_Zoonotic_Update/img/map1_2022_02_23.jpg

"The epidemiology of avian influenza viruses is complex: they can change and evolve by mutation and reassortment, with the emergence of new subtypes causing significant impacts on animal health and production. Some subtypes (not all) can be zoonotic, and therefore pose a threat to human health. Transmission of AI viruses to humans occurs when there is close contact with infected birds or heavily contaminated environments."
