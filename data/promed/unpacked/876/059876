RICE GRASSY STUNT VIRUS - VIET NAM (MEKONG DELTA)

A total of 143 000 hectares (346 000 acres) of summer and winter rice
crops in the Mekong Delta region are being plagued by insects. This
is twice as much as the area under attack in early July [2007].
According to Viet Nam News Agency, the provinces suffering the most
are Kien Giang, Bac Lieu, Tien Giang, Tra Vinh, and Hau Giang. In
these areas, insect density ranges from 1000 to 2000 insects per square meter.
In some places, it is as high as 20 000 per square meter. In many
provinces, 20 to 100 percent of the insects caught in insect traps
carry _Rice grassy stunt virus_.
According to the Department of Plant Protection, during this rainy
season, the southwestern wind is likely to spread insects to large
areas throughout the Mekong Delta region, attacking summer and winter crops.
Insects have spread as far as Ho Chi Minh City, where in recent days
local residents have been harassed by insects swarming around street
lamps and insect corpses littering their houses.
Local experts said that every night, from 30 000 to 40 000 insects
flew into lamp traps and this would continue with the number rising
as high as 150 000 insects per trap per night. Farmers have been
advised to start sowing one to 3 days after insects fly into the
highest lamp traps.

[_Rice grassy stunt virus_ (RGSV; genus _Tenuivirus_, family
_Bunyaviridae_) is transmitted by the planthopper species
_Nilaparvata lugens_, _N. bakeri_, and _N. muiri_ in a persistent
manner (that is, viruliferous insects remain infective for life). It
is acquired by feeding by both nymphs and adults, multiplies in the
vector, and is retained during moulting, but it is not passed on to
the insect progeny. The virus is not transmitted by seed, pollen, or
mechanical means.
Due to the specificity of the vector, rice (_Oryza sativa_) is the
only natural host. Symptoms are severe stunting, excessive tillering
('grassy' appearance), erect growth habit, leaf spots, and reduced
pale leaves. Infected plants usually survive until maturity, but
produce no panicles. RGSV has been reported to cause serious damage
in limited areas during sporadic outbreaks of its vector. It is
spreading in large parts of the rice-growing areas of Asia. Disease
management includes rice varieties resistant to the virus or the
vector, chemical or biological vector control, and cultural practices
(for example short term draining of rice fields, rice-free periods,
staggered nitrogen applications).
_N. lugens_, the Asian brown planthopper, is one of the worst pests
of rice in the Australasian and Pacific Island region. It causes
yellowing, browning, and drying of plants and leaves small injuries
exposing the plant to fungal and bacterial infections. It is also the
vector of _Rice ragged stunt virus_ (RRSV; genus _Oryzavirus_, family
_Reoviridae_).
A number of other rice viruses are spread by green leafhoppers
(_Nephotettix_ species). The report does not specify which insect
species are involved and a mixture of planthoppers, leafhoppers, and
other species is likely.
