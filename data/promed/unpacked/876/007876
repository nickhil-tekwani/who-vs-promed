From: LeAnna Hatcher <LHatcher@HCNetwork.org>

I have read the postings which "back-up" mine and others concerns
regarding many vaccine preventable diseases. With DTaP now in
increasingly short supply with delays on 4th and 5th doses this seems
ominous -- We talk of vaccinating adults but do not have enough for
our children at this point in time! With the possible decrease in MMR
vaccine we risk measles outbreaks as seen in previous decades --
Decrease in Prevnar - Long time hold on ALL routine Dt vaccines which
risk increasing tetanus - I would think before we worry about
increasing number/age of persons vaccinated maybe we need to look at
how we can resolve the current shortages and remove risk for future
ones.

Notice to Readers: Update: Supply of Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids
and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine
-----------------------
Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP)
remains in short supply, and the shortage will continue into mid-2002
(1). Shortages are greatest in the public sector. Despite high
vaccination rates, pertussis continues to cause serious illness and
death, particularly among infants aged over 6 months who are too
young to have completed the 3-dose primary series of DTaP. In 2000, a
total of 1873 pertussis cases (rate: 99 per 100,000 infants aged over
6 months) and 16 deaths were reported among infants aged over 6
months. Vaccinating infants on time with the 3-dose primary series of
DTaP to protect them from serious disease remains a priority during
this vaccine shortage.
The shortage began in 2000 when 2 manufacturers (Wyeth Lederle, Pearl
River, New York, and Baxter Hyland Immuno Vaccines, Baltimore,
Maryland) stopped production of DTaP (1). Aventis Pasteur
(Swiftwater, Pennsylvania) and GlaxoSmithKline (Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania), producers of Tripedia and Infanrix, respectively, are
the only 2 U.S. suppliers.
DTaP is recommended as a 5-dose series: 3 doses administered to
infants at ages 2, 4, and 6 months, followed by 2 additional doses at
age 15--18 months and at age 4--6 years (2). During the shortage of
DTaP, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends
that providers who do not have enough DTaP to vaccinate all children
with 5 doses give priority to vaccinating infants with the first 3
doses. To ensure an adequate supply of DTaP to vaccinate infants,
providers should first defer vaccination of children aged 15--18
months with the fourth DTaP dose. If deferring the fourth dose does
not leave enough DTaP to vaccinate infants, then the fifth DTaP dose
(given to children aged 4--6 years) also should be deferred*. In
areas with severe DTaP shortages, local public health officials might
elect to recommend communitywide deferral of the fourth DTaP dose,
and, if necessary, the fifth DTaP dose.
When the DTaP shortage ends, providers should recall and administer
DTaP to all children who missed a dose. Vaccination of children aged
4--6 years is needed to ensure immunity to pertussis, diphtheria, and
tetanus during the elementary school years (2).

*Children traveling to countries where the risk for diphtheria is
high should be vaccinated according to the Recommended Childhood
Immunization Schedule (3). Travelers might be at increased risk for
exposure to toxigenic strains of _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_,
especially with prolonged travel, extensive contact with children, or
exposure to poor hygiene. High-risk countries include
Africa---Algeria, Egypt, and sub-Saharan Africa; Americas---Brazil,
Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Haiti; Asia/Oceania---Afghanistan,
Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Laos,
Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Syria, Thailand,

[Ms. Hatcher's comment is very well placed given the current vaccine
shortages -- relevant in terms of triaging who should get vaccine as
a priority, but doesn't eliminate the need to pay attention to the
changing epidemiology of the disease if one aims to really control
the disease and reduce the morbidity in the long term.
The MMWR article advising on recommended priorities for vaccination
with the DTaP vaccine where insufficient doses are available was
included above for readers. More information on the vaccine
shortages currently experienced in the USA can be found at
