There have been 85 cases of _Salmonella oranienburg_ infection notified to
the South Australian Department of Human Services to date in 1998. In
previous years 1-9 cases have been notified per year (South Australia has a
population of 1.5 millions).

Early investigations suggested that an Italian food, often eaten at
restaurants was the source, but no specific foods could be identified. A
case-control study was conducted which showed a raised risk for eating
Italian food and for eating gelato.

Food histories show that, of the cases where there is a record of eating
gelato and where the brand could be identified, most of the cases ate the
same brand.

Samples, from the factory, of the brand of gelato have been examined
microbiologically, and _Salmonella oranienburg_ has been isolated from
several. The factory has been inspected and environmental samples taken
for microbiology. Results are not yet available.

The manufacturer, who has been very cooperative, has undertaken a voluntary
recall of gelato products.

Further investigation is continuing.
