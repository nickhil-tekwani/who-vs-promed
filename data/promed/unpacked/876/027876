The food security situation in the country could be affected by an early
annual season of food shortages in the west and east. For the north
affected by floods, the case is different. After the losses of the 1st
harvest, people sowed again hoping to harvest between February and March
[2009]. However, the irregularity of rainfall and temperature changes at
the end of the year [2008], as well as the humidity, caused the
proliferation of fungi called Mancha de Asfalto (_Phyllachora maydis_ and
_Monographella maydis_).

Damages due to the Mancha de Asfalto plague have not yet been assessed.
Although no large areas of affected crops were reported, a slight reduction
in yields is expected, which would result in lower reserves in homes that
were already experiencing problems of food availability.

Prices remaining stable during the next quarter would be expected if the
damages by Mancha de Asfalto in the north do not affect the crop
significantly. The government has a contingency plan for communities
identified as high and very high risk. Maize is the main source of calories
and protein in the Guatemalan diet.

[Tar spot of maize is a disease complex, which has been known to cause
serious yield losses in Central and South America. It is caused by the
association of at least 3 fungal species: _Phyllachora maydis_,
_Monographella maydis_, and _Coniothyrium phyllachorae_.

Of these, _P. maydis_ is usually the first to cause leaf lesions. While _M.
maydis_ is a common benign saprophyte on leaf surfaces, it becomes highly
virulent only in association with _P. maydis_ and forms necrotic rings
around the _P. maydis_ lesions. _C. phyllachorae_ may be a hyperparasite of
the other 2, but its role is not fully understood yet. Leaf lesions may
coalesce causing blight and complete burning of the foliage. In addition,
characteristic black, shiny spots ('tar spots') are produced both within
lesions and on other leaf areas. Affected ears have fewer kernels, which
may germinate prematurely on the cob.

_P. maydis_ is an obligate parasite, its spores are spread by wind, and it
produces a potent toxin killing plant tissue. The disease is favoured by
cool, humid conditions. Disease management relies mainly on the use of
resistant maize varieties, however little is known about the genetics of
tar spot resistance.

Contrary to the claims in the item above that maize yield may not be
severely affected, outbreaks of Mancha de Asfalto have been reported
earlier in the 2008/2009 season from the northern provinces of Guatemala
with estimated crop losses of up to 75 per cent in Alta Verapaz and Quiche,
and 50 per cent in Peten (see ProMED-mail post no. 20090220.0710).
