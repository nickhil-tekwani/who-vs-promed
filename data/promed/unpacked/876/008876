The 2-year-old daughter of missionaries in Africa is now in Dayton [Ohio] with her parents for medical care after the child contracted _E. coli_ during a mission trip. The parents currently staying in Cedarville, live in Ivory Coast, Africa, as missionaries. The couple are alumni of Cedarville University.

After an extensive search for medical care, they settled on Dayton Children's Hospital for the 2-year-old. The 2-year-old's kidneys stopped functioning and she was unable to urinate for 10 days. Her kidneys are functioning at 50 percent now. The child was first evacuated to a Paris hotel, but the family returned to the USA because the mother is also pregnant.

The family on 5 Jul 2016 saw Dr Abi Omoloja for treatment of the child's kidney disease. "Coming to Dayton Children's after spending time in hospitals in Africa and the hospital in Paris was like walking into Disney World," the father said in a release. "The amenities here go above and beyond, and the staff was willing to drop everything to help our family."

[Although in almost 500 postings on ProMED-mail on _E. coli_, mostly EHEC, there is not one regarding the infection being acquired in Africa, it is likely that many are not being diagnosed there except, for the most part, in travelers returning to Europe or America. Although kidney injury serious enough to require dialysis can occur if severe dehydration or hypotension occur from _E. coli_ bacteremia or severe diarrhea, it is likely that this case represents enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ acquired in West Africa.
