[The above is OIE's most recent African swine fever (ASF) follow-up report from China as of 6 Oct 2018.

Since the 1st official confirmation and reporting of ASF in China, dated 3 Aug 2018, located in the northeastern province of Liaoning, ASF was detected in 34 sites (farms/abattoirs) in 7 provinces and an autonomous region. These were the provinces: Anhui, Heilongjiang, Henan, Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, plus the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. More than 90 000 pigs have been culled so far to halt further spread.

Actions taken by China: closing of live pig markets in infected provinces and prohibiting the movement of live pig and pork products from infected provinces. The government set a 3 km (1.86 miles) "epidemic zone" and a 10 km (6.21 miles) "buffer zone" around the epidemic zones. All pigs in holdings confirmed as infected are culled (stamping out policy) against compensation.

The movement control measures, applied in epidemic zones, are lifted, liable to assessment, if no additional cases are detected therein during the following 6 weeks. This policy has been already applied as follows:

29 Sep 2018: epidemic zone Shenbei New District, Shenyang City, Liaoning Province ("Lifting the blockade of the African pig plague area in Shenyang, Liaoning", in Chinese at http://www.moa.gov.cn/gk/yjgl_1/yjcl/201809/t20180929_6159663.htm)
1 Oct 2018: epidemic zone in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province (http://www.moa.gov.cn/gk/yjgl_1/yjcl/201809/t20180930_6159698.htm)
4 Oct 2018: epidemic zone in Lianyungang City, Jiangsu Province (http://www.moa.gov.cn/gk/yjgl_1/yjcl/201810/t20181003_6159767.htm)

China reports to the OIE relate to each affected province as a separate event; hence, there are currently 8 ASF threads. - Mod.AS
