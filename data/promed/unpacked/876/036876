Ebola Suspects Hospitalized in Fourth Ugandan Town
--------------------------------------------------
KAMPALA: Three people suffering from Ebola hemorrhagic fever-like symptoms
have been found in Uganda's second-largest town for the first time, raising
new fears on Fri 8 Dec 2000 that the lethal disease is spreading. The
state-owned New Vision newspaper reported that the 3 patients were taken to
the main hospital in Jinja town, 80 kilometers east of the capital of
Kampala. The senior hospital administrator, Ronald Segawa, said the
patients were admitted in critical condition but were improving gradually.
Segawa said tests were under way to determine whether the patients were
suffering from Ebola hemorrhagic fever. "Blood samples of these patients
have already been taken from them and have been sent to Kampala for
testing. We hope to get the full results within 24 hours," he said. To
date, the Ebola outbreak has been confined to Gulu town, 360 kilometers
north of Kampala, Masindi town 300 kilometers northwest of Kampala, and
Mbarara town, 280 kilometers southwest of Kampala. Unconfirmed reports from
Jinja said 6 Ebola victims had been admitted to the hospital. The reports
said 2 of the victims died on Thu, 7 Dec 2000. Ebola fever has killed 156
people, including 14 health workers, in Uganda since September.
In Rwanda, Uganda's neighbor to the southwest, a 16-year-old boy died on
Mon 4 Dec 2000 of symptoms similar to those of Ebola fever. He was buried
in the Nyamirambo cemetery on the outskirts of the capital of Kigali.
Rwanda's Health Minister, Ezechias Rwabuhihi, said blood samples from the
boy would be taken to the World Health Organization laboratory in Gulu to
test for Ebola virus. Uganda's neighbors Kenya and Tanzania have taken
strict precautions against the Ebola outbreak, and there has been no report
so far of any Ebola virus infection within their territories. The strain of
Ebola virus in Uganda is similar to the one first identified in Sudan in
the late 1970s.
