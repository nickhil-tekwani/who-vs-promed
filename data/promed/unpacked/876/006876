SELF-HELP ORGANIZATIONS - DEVELOPING COUNTRIES: RFI
***************************************************
A ProMED-mail post
Date: Thu, 30 Oct 1997 17:58:05 +0530
From: Ian Smith <iansmith@mos.com.np>

Self help groups and patient's organisations for people with specific
diseases/conditions, including emerging/re-emerging diseases, are a common
feature in the West, but much less common in developing countries. Indeed,
it seems from my limited experience, that most disease specific
organisations in the developed world are primarily supported by people who
do not have the disease themselves (eg Anti TB Associations, Leprosy
Associations), perhaps with the exception of some AIDS organisations.
I would be grateful for details (including means of contacting them) of any
self help groups/patient's organisations in developing countries.
