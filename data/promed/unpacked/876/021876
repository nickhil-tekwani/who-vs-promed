EU bans Bulgarian poultry imports over disease outbreak
---------------------------------------------------
The European Union Thursday [23 Dec 2004] suspended all imports of live
poultry from Bulgaria after an outbreak of a highly contagious bird disease
in the EU candidate country.
The EU's executive commission said the outbreak of Newcastle disease had
been confirmed in the region of Kardjali, near Bulgaria's borders with
Greece and Turkey.
The disease is not harmful to humans but is highly contagious in poultry,
especially chickens, and can cause major losses in the sector if not
curbed, the European Commission said.
The EU ban was imposed as a "safeguard measure" and covers imports of
Bulgarian live poultry, game birds, hatching eggs and fresh poultry meat,
it said.
The decision will be reviewed at a meeting of EU health experts in January
2005.
Bulgaria is hoping to join the EU in 2007, along with Romania, and plans to
sign its accession treaty in April in 2005.
