Cattle disease diagnosis in Nicola Valley was false
---------------------------------------------------
Scientists, food health officials and ranchers expressed surprise
when a cattle disease never seen before in British Columbia (B.C.)
showed up in the Nicola Valley. Now they have learned the diagnosis
was wrong.

The general manager of the B.C. Cattlemen's Association, Kevin Boon,
said federal officials have informed him and others the finding of
anaplasmosis in 18 animals was false. The Canadian Food and
Inspection Agency (CFIA) declared last year [2009] that anaplasmosis
was found in the Nicola Valley. The cattle disease, prevalent in the
warmer United States, was thought to have been eradicated in Canada.

Anaplasmosis is transmitted by ticks and, less often, by biting
flies. It can also be transmitted by tainted needles and tools used
by ranchers, but is not otherwise contagious. According to the CFIA,
anaplasmosis poses no threat to human health. Animals tested and
found positive are slaughtered and processed through the regular
supply chain.

After routine testing at Douglas Lake Ranch found a positive for
anaplasmosis, the agency instituted a quarantine order and oversaw
testing of 15 000 animals for the disease.

In an e-mail message, a CFIA official, Jule Lepage, confirmed the
quarantine has been lifted but provided no other information.

"Further research in this matter was unable to confirm the presence
of anaplasmosis in the animals which originally tested positive.
Based on the lack of sufficient scientific evidence to support the
presence of anaplasmosis in these herds, a decision has been made to
remove the remaining quarantines in the Nicola Valley."

Now ranchers are seeking hardship compensation for the quarantine and
extraordinary work of bringing in cattle from the range for blood
testing. Boon said while half the cattle were slaughtered after
positive tests, others were retested when doubts emerged.

[How very disturbing that the animals are called positive and then
the decision is reversed. One wonders what the method of testing was?
There are a number of tests capable of detecting anaplasmosis, and
they are used at various laboratories. There is the competitive
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA), there is a PCR test, and
there is a card test and a modified card test. There are likely
others, depending upon the laboratory. How this could happen is
unclear and could be anything from an out of date test kit to an
untrained operator. Nevertheless, it will certainly call for the
laboratory to make a statement as to how this could have happened. -
