Duck farmer suspected of contracting bird flu
---------------------------------------------
A 37-year-old resident of Tanjuang Durian, suspected to have
contracted bird flu [avian influenza A/(H5N1)] virus, [has been]
admitted to M Djamil hospital.

The patient is a duck farmer who had been raising hundreds of ducks.
He is reported to have found that almost of all his ducks suddenly
died. Subsequent to this [event], he buried the dead ducks. He
developed high fever at noon the same day, and his family gave him an
antipyretic drug, a brand of paracetamol. His fever [increased during]
the afternoon and his family took him to Pasa Baru Public Health
Center in the evening. The Public Health Center then referred the
patient to M Zein Painan Hospital, where he was diagnosed as a bird
flu suspect. The patient was transferred then to M Djamil hospital to
receive [more appropriate] treatment as a suspected bird flu patient.

Numerous suspected human cases of avian H5N1 influenza have been
reported regularly in various regions of Indonesia, mostly in the
local press, but none have been confirmed subsequently. According to
the WHO Timeline there has been no confirmed case of avian influenza
(H5N1) virus infection in Indonesia throughout 2009
(<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2009_11_27/en/index.html>).

During 2009 so far Egypt has been the most affected country with 39
confirmed cases, followed by China with 7 cases and Viet Nam with 4. -

[Indonesia's poultry/waterbirds industry has been heavily and
continuously H5N1-infected. I have recently met one of the
international experts with Indonesian experience and he confirmed that
this is still the situation. ProMED-mail have posted 32 items on avian
influenza in Indonesia (including 25 on suspected human cases) since
the beginning of 2009. - Mod.AS/JW]
