BITTER FRUIT / ILLNESSES RAISE SAFETY CONCERNS ON IMPORTED PRODUCE
October 13, 1997
Newsday
Thomas Maier
A story about recent outbreaks of food borne illness associated with fresh
fruit, beginning with the recounting of an April wedding in Westchester
County, N.Y., where fresh raspberries were linked with 20 cases of
cyclosporiasis (of 160 guests).
The story says that during the past two winter seasons, cyclospora
[contamination of Guatemala's raspberry crops has caused more than 2,000
cases of cramping illness and bloody diarrhea for those who ate it in the
United States.
The story concludes that American consumers are increasingly vulnerable to
food-borne illness from abroad, at least in part from government trade
policies that have opened the door to an even greater reliance on imported
food. Along with Guatemalan raspberries, similar recent food disease
outbreaks have been linked to strawberries, lettuce, basil and other
produce.
Dr. Robert Tauxe, Chief of the U.S. Center for Disease Control's food-borne
and diarrheal diseases branch was quoted as saying, "Problems that were
resolved a long time ago in this country are coming back to haunt us now
with imported food."
In a visit to Guatemalan farms last week, the story says that a Newsday
reporter found unsanitary conditions including workers relieving themselves
in the fields.
The story also cites FDA officials as saying they plan to ban Guatemalan
raspberries next spring, when outbreaks of the seasonal [cyclosporiasis
usually occur. Scientists are unsure why one season is more susceptible.
The story cites federal officials as predicting that foodborne illness,
which now kills an estimated 9,000 Americans a year, will rise 10 to 15 per
cent over the next decade for a variety of reasons.
The story says that newly emerging food illness like [cyclosporiasis from
the Guatemalan raspberries, as well as strains of E. coli, hepatitis,
salmonella and other diseases, are steadily increasing. [While most cases
still are caused by domestic food, New York State's food safety chief said
inspectors are seeing more and more cases linked to foreign produce.
NAFTA and other trade deals have dramatically increased the amount of
foreign fruits and vegetables in the U.S. market since 1993.
The story cites [denials by federal officials deny that NAFTA, which went
into effect in 1994, and other trade agreements have exposed Americans to
new diseases from foreign foods. They say [that, much of the recent
concern about imported food is being drummed up by opponents of President
Clinton's proposal to expand NAFTA with new "fast-track trade
authorization."
Jay Ziegler, spokesman for the U.S. trade representative's office
overseeing NAFTA expansion was quoted as saying, "The opponents single out
specific examples of food contamination and say trade is the problem, and
that's not right."
Dr. Martin Blaser of Vanderbilt Medical School in Nashville, who wrote for
the New England Journal of Medicine last year on the health dangers of
globalization of the food supply was quoted as saying, "Trade is a
many-edged sword. We can eat fruit at all times of the year. But one of
the costs is that sanitation in many of these countries is not as good as
this country. As we continue to import more food, there will be more
health costs, as we see with cyclospora."
Dr. Barbara Herwoldt, who headed the CDC task force investigating the
cyclospora outbreak, was quoted as saying these new diseases "give us a
wake-up call to reconsider what we're doing with food safety. Cyclospora
is not a nationally identifiable disease and it's not required to be
reported to the CDC. This illness can be very severe and the effects quite
lengthy but we expect most of the cases in this outbreak went unreported."

[2 SANITATION IN THE FIELDS FALLS SHORT
October 13, 1997
Newsday
Ray Sanchez
Chimaltenango, Guatemala -- This story begins by saying that under a steady
rain, two sisters, ages 9 and 10, pick raspberries destined for dreamy
desserts and gourmet dishes throughout the United States. They left school
a year ago to work beside their 51-year-old mother, Cristina Reyes
Castillo, piling mounds of fruit into clear plastic containers for export
throughout the world.
On the farm, hand-scrawled signs urge workers to wash their hands with
soap. But on two consecutive days last week, at sinks constructed in the
raspberry fields after outbreaks of a strange new parasitic disease were
linked to Guatemalan raspberries, there was no soap. And here, as well as
at another farm nearby, the fancy new bathrooms were not always used. A
tin-roofed latrine on a nearby cabbage patch was five minutes away, several
laborers said, so workers occasionally relieved themselves near the
raspberry plants.
The story goes on to say that after consultation with the Centers for
Disease Control and U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Guatemala's berry
industry last year implemented a series of regulations aimed at improving
sanitary conditions on farms.
Growers were required to irrigate with well water, which is tested
periodically. Toilets and bathrooms with running water also were required
along with cleaning stations with soap. But the story says, despite the
precautions, visits to several farms and interviews with agriculture
inspectors here last week underscored the perils of monitoring global food
trade.
[1. "Free trade causes plagues" is a well-known historical lesson. 2. It
appears that a significant benefit of the globalization of the world food
supply is going to be increased medical and sanitary attention devoted to
developing countries by industrialized ones obtaining food from them. -RAL
