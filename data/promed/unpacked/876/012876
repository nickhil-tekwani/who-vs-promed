Measles Breaks Out in Lusaka, Zambia
------------------------------------
A measles outbreak has hit the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) and
4 other health centres in Lusaka. According to sources at the
Ministry of Health the cases of measles have increased to 86 in the
last 3 months -- January to April 2010 -- with UTH recording the
highest number of infected children.

"UTH has been recording an increase in the number of measles cases,
from only 2 admissions in January, to over 20 cases as of 6 Apr
2010," a source said. Chawama had 36 cases, Kanyama 6, Mandevu 4,
while Makeni recorded 3 cases. The sources added that the highest
number of cases recorded at the UTH was in March 2010 when admissions
reached 37. Since the beginning of April, 22 admissions had been
recorded.

A source attributed the current measles outbreak to the failure by
health centres in Lusaka to carry out effective immunisation of
children. "It could be because of limited financial resources, poor
road networks in hard-to-reach areas, and inadequate manpower," the
source explained. Only 13 out of the 24 health centres in Lusaka were
carrying out immunisation campaigns.

The most affected age group was between 9 months and 5 years.
However, the youngest casualty is a 3-month-old baby. Out of the
total number of infected children in Lusaka, 41 are suspected not to
have been immunised against the virus.

Lusaka District Health Management Team officials held an emergency
meeting during the week to whip up interventions to stop the outbreak
from escalating. Ministry of Health spokesperson Kamoto Mbewe said he
did not have the details on the outbreak but the Ministry was still
compiling data. But UTH public relations officer Pauline Mbangweta
yesterday confirmed the cases of measles at UTH and most of the
admissions were as a result of referrals from health centres. She
cited Chawama as having the highest number of referred cases to UTH.
However, Ms Mbangweta could not give exact figures of the current
admissions, but said there were no deaths as a result of the outbreak.

[The ages of the patients suggests that this outbreak is affecting
mainly children who have not received protective vaccination or are
only partially vaccinated. A map of Lusaka, showing the location of

Currently outbreaks of measles virus infection are occurring
throughout Africa (see ProMED-mail archived reports below) and
elsewhere in the world, to such a degree that the US CDC (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention) has issued an updated Travel Advice
statement updated to 13 Apr 2010.

"Because of the risk of measles in both developed and developing
countries (particularly South Africa and the Philippines), all
international travelers should be up to date on immunizations,
regardless of the travel destination. In addition, expatriates should
make sure they are vaccinated against measles, especially in areas
where outbreaks are occurring." This document should be consulted for
background information on the disease, the availability of vaccine
and risk assessment (see:
