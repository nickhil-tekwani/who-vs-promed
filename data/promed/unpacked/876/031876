Monthly Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease Statistics - As of Mon 6 Feb 2006
-----------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is today [Mon 6 Feb 2006] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt Jakob
disease. This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of
the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy).
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK, as of Mon 6 Feb 2006:
Summary of vCJD Cases - Deaths
-----------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 110
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 44
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 154
Summary of vCJD Cases - Alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 5
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 159
(The next table will be published on Mon 6 Mar 2006.)
[Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Fri 6 Jan
2006, the total number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD has
increased by one due to the death of one of the surviving probable
cases. Consequently, the overall total number of definite or probable
vCJD cases (dead and alive) remains 159.
These data are consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the
UK is now in decline (see following report). The number of deaths due
to definite or probable vCJD in the UK during the 12 months of 2005
remains 5. The peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000,
followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005,
and one so far in 2006. - Mod.CP]
Totals for All Types of CJD Cases in the UK during 2005
-----------------------------------------------
As of 6 Feb 2006, in the UK in the year 2005, there were 119
referrals of suspected CJD, and there were 62 deaths from sporadic
CJD, 6 from familial CJD, 3 from iatrogenic CJD, 4 GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker) syndrome cases, and 5 deaths from
vCJD. The corresponding figures so far for 2006 are: 10 referrals, 4
deaths from sporadic CJD, one from vCJD, and none from familial CJD,
iatrogenic CJD or GSS.

Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in the United Kingdom and
Elsewhere: Situation at the end of 2005
-----------------------------------------------
By the end of December 2005, a total of 159 cases of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) had been reported in the United
Kingdom, of which 153 have so far resulted in death. Elsewhere,
numbers remain small, with 15 cases in France, 4 in Ireland, 2 in the
United States, and one each in Canada, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands,
Portugal, Saudi Arabia and Spain (1,2).
In the UK, 5 deaths from vCJD were reported in 2005, 4 fewer than the
previous year's total of 9. Results from modeling the incidence of
deaths indicate that the current epidemic wave reached a peak of 28
deaths in 2000 and has since declined [illustrated by a figure in the
original text, comprising a plot of vCJD deaths by year and a fitted
quadratic model for incidence trends]. Extrapolating this trend gives
an estimate of 2 deaths in the next 12 months (95 percent prediction
interval 0 to 5). With 6 patients alive at the end of 2005, however,
a prediction of 2 deaths is likely to be an underestimate (3).
It is important to note that, to date, all vCJD cases have been
methionine homozygote at codon 129 of the prion protein gene.
Preclinical vCJD infection has, however, been reported in a
heterozygous patient after blood transfusion from a donor who
subsequently developed vCJD (4). Although the initial epidemic wave
is now in decline, it is possible that there will be further
epidemics of cases in other genetic groups. There is also the
possibility of continuing person to person transmission through
certain forms of health care (for instance, in relation to surgery,
blood transfusion or treatment with plasma products). It is
essential, therefore, to maintain and promote active surveillance of
CJD to investigate these possibilities.

[3] CWD prions in deer muscle
Date: Fri 27 Jan 2006

Prion Disease Found Lurking in Deer Muscle
-----------------------------------------------
The infectious prions that cause Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), an
infection similar to BSE that afflicts North American deer and elk,
have been found in the parts of the animals that people eat. No one
knows whether CWD can jump to humans, but if it does, hunters in
affected areas might be at risk.
CWD was 1st diagnosed as a spongiform encephalopathy in captive deer
and elk in Colorado in the 1970s and in wild deer and elk in the
region in the 1980s. But in the 1990s, it spread widely within the
elk farming industry, jumped to wild deer, and now affects 2
provinces of Canada and 13 US states. Like the related sheep disease
scrapie -- though unlike BSE -- CWD spreads from animal to animal,
says Glenn Telling of the University of Kentucky at Lexington, US.
Deer housed with infected animals, or fed infected brain
experimentally, contract the disease.
Because of this, there are fears that the CWD prion might be
distributed widely in the deer's tissues, as scrapie is in sheep.
Efforts to find the infectious prion in the muscle of infected
animals by seeing whether antibodies to the prion could find any and
bind to them have previously failed. But Telling's lab has now shown,
using transgenic mice, that disease prions can reside in the muscle
of deer infected with CWD. The team replaced the gene for the normal
mouse version of the prion protein with the normal gene from deer, so
the mice made the normal, healthy deer protein. They then injected
the mouse brains with tissue from infected deer. 12 to 18 months
later, the mice developed encephalopathy.
Tissues from both the infected deer's brains and thigh muscles caused
disease. Muscle took slightly longer to cause disease than brain
tissue, showing it had slightly less prion. "We don't know that it is
transmitted in the wild by animals eating muscle from infected
animals," cautions Telling. "We now have to see where else the prion
might be," including saliva and even excrement, using more transgenic
mice. "Because we tested deer that were already ill," he told New
Scientist, "we don't know what the distribution of prion is in
animals that are still incubating the disease." Hunters have been
warned by wildlife agencies not to kill and eat obviously ill
animals, but an animal not yet showing signs of the disease might
still carry the abnormal prion, albeit less of it.
It is also unknown whether people can catch encephalopathy by eating
CWD-infected meat, as they can from eating BSE-tainted meat.
Anecdotal reports that hunters develop the human prion disease CJD in
unusual numbers have never been confirmed. State officials have
issued warnings to hunters not to eat brain or spinal cord, the
tissues most affected. "If I were a hunter, I would be cautious about
eating deer in areas affected," says Telling. But he notes that not
much testing of wildlife has been done, and it is not clear how
prevalent the infection is.

Toward a Better Understanding of Human Prion Diseases
-----------------------------------------------
Misfolding of a single protein, the cellular prion protein (PrPc)
into the disease-associated form PrPSc is believed to cause fatal
prion diseases in humans and other mammals, including sheep, cattle,
and deer. The misfolding can occur sporadically or after contact --
through inoculation or ingestion -- with PrPSc from an external
source. There are also familial forms of prion diseases that are
associated with certain mutations in PNRP, the gene encoding PrPc.
These abnormal PrPc proteins are thought to have a higher probability
to misfold than normal PrPc. The idea is that a few misfolded
molecules can initiate a chain reaction and cause transformation of
many of the other PrPc molecules into harmful PrPSc versions. The
presence of PrPSc proteins causes widespread cell death, leading to
the characteristic spongiform degeneration of the brain that kills
patients, most of them within a matter of months.
The most common human prion disease is sporadic Creutzfeld-Jacob
Disease (sCJD). The disease is rare (affecting roughly one to 2
individuals per a million people, worldwide), and its etiology is
unclear; neither exogenous nor endogenous causes have been
identified. sCJD is inevitably fatal, but the disease is clinically,
pathologically, and genetically heterogeneous. Most patients have
rapidly progressing dementia, often accompanied by involuntary muscle
spasms, and death occurs within months of the 1st clinical symptoms.
However, for some patients ataxia is the 1st clinical sign, while
others develop sight problems, and for some, the disease duration can
be more than 2 years. In the hope that understanding the
heterogeneity will help them to understand what causes sCJD,
researchers are trying to systematically collect and catalog data
from patients. To do this in a meaningful way, standardized assays
that allow results from different patients and different laboratories
to be compared in a meaningful way are necessary.
Markus Glatzel and colleagues have developed such an assay and
applied it as part of the detailed molecular characterization to
autopsy samples from 50 patients with sCJD. The new assay, which the
researchers call PrPSc profiling, measures the amount of PrPSc in
defined brain regions. In the past, PrPSc amounts were routinely only
measured in one or 2 regions by a variety of assays. PrPSc profiling
quantifies the amount of PrPSc in 9 defined brain regions relative to
internal standards, and thereby allows for direct comparison of
individual profiles. The researchers determined PrPSc profiles of 50
patients and tried to correlate the profiles with information on
disease types of the patients and prion types present in the
different brain areas. sCJD types are determined by a patient's PRNP
genotype at the polymorphic position 129 of PRNP and by the relative
resistance of PrPSc to proteolytic degradation. It is thought that
most patients only have one prion type, but previous reports have
described coexistence of 2 different types in some samples.
Analysis of this wealth of data revealed correlations between
distinct PrPSc distribution patterns and sCJD subtypes. These results
have implications for confirmation of sCJD by brain biopsy. Before
doing such biopsies, Glatzel and colleagues suggest, the sCJD subtype
should be determined so that the correct brain area is examined. The
researchers also found coexistence of 2 different prion types in 20
percent of their overall samples, and in more than 50 percent of the
samples from patients who were heterozygous for the 129 polymorphism
in the PRNP gene. These data lend further support to a link between
molecular signature and clinical heterogeneity of the disease.
While many questions remain, this study underlines that the
systematic analysis of prion cases can reveal links between molecular
pathology, genetic makeup of patients, and disease symptoms. Glatzel
and colleagues believe that "PrPSc profiling will be a valuable tool
for prion research." In the hope that it will "facilitate comparisons
of PrPSc quantities present in defined samples," the researchers will
make their PrPSc standard available to the scientific community.

[The Eurosurveillance article (part 2) charting the decline of vCJD
in humans in the UK gives an estimate of 2 deaths in the next 12
months (95 percent prediction interval 0 to 5). However, with 6 vCJD
patients alive at the end of 2005, and one death recorded already in
January 2006, a prediction of 2 deaths in 2006 is likely to be an
underestimate. - Mod.CP]
