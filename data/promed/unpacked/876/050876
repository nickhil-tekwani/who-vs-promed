VIRAL HEMORRHAGIC SEPTICEMIA, FISH - IRELAND (02)

I am not an ichtyo-virologist however I find intriguing that a virus could
be associated with a "septicaemia". Some human septicaemia's present
problems in differential diagnosis with viral hemorrhagic syndromes (a
recent example is the Ebola alert in Dominican Republic eventually resolved
as Meningococcic purpura), but I don't recall any human viral disease
referred as "septicaemia". Can anyone explain further the reasons for this
peculiar name?
[I stopped down the hall to chat with Ed Noga about this query on viral
hemorrhagic septicemia. He says that there is no good pathological reason
for the name other than affected fish have vascular damage that similar to
the kind of damage septicemias cause in fish. At first glance the disease
appeared to be a septicemia and it seems as if the first name given to the
disease has stuck. Unfortunate but not unusual. Obviously, if it is a
caused by a virus, a rhabdovirus in this case, a viremia occurs. This
disease does have important trade implications for salmonid production.-
