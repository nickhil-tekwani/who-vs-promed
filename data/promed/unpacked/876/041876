Hundreds of horses have died from an unknown disease in the Qyzylorda region, Channel One Eurasia reports. According to local residents, 200 horses died in the village.

"It started back in August [2020] and is still the case. It is not clear what they die from. We have been raising livestock for 50 years, but we have never seen anything like this, "said [KK], a resident of the Baikenzhe village.

On average, an animal is sick for about 10 days, does not really eat, loses weight, then dies. Treatment is ineffective. The stallion does not allow sick horses to approach the herd, the TV channel reports.

The veterinary inspection said that the people themselves are to blame for the incident. The disease from which horses die is gastrofiliasis caused by the larvae of the horse botfly. They get on the animal when they graze in the steppe.

"This year it was very hot, there was no rain. The animals need special care; it was necessary to graze in the evening, not during the day. They also had to do disinfection, clean the horses, wash them so that there were no insects on the animals," said Marat Kazybaev, director of the veterinary station in Zhanakorgan region.

The disease was officially confirmed in 4 districts of the Qyzylorda region. The Akimat [regional government] intends to create a working commission and discuss whether it will be possible to pay owners compensation for their dead animals.

[In Kazakhstan, 4 species of _Gasterophilus_ have been identified, namely, _G. intestinalis, _G. haemorrhoidalis_, _G. nasalis_, and _G. pecorum_ (Ref 1).

Horse bots are the parasitic larvae of the botflies, _Gasterophilus_ spp. Adult females deposit their eggs onto hair shafts of horses. Bot larvae are eventually ingested through grooming and can cause inflammatory reactions during migration within the oral cavity and by attachment to the stomach wall. In general, bot larvae are considered benign, even though some pathology is observed. Bot larvae can be identified during oral inspection or gastroscopy. Treatment of choice is ivermectin (0.2 mg/kg), which has documented efficacy against both oral and gastric stages.

A detailed description of the cycle, clinical signs, modes of diagnosis, treatment and prevention is presented in Ref 2.

Bot larvae cause minimal pathology in most horses. Mass mortality in horses, due solely to botfly infestation, as suggested in the current media report, is highly unusual; other candidate etiologies -- biological, metabolic, chemical or physical -- deserve to be considered, addressed, and excluded or otherwise.
