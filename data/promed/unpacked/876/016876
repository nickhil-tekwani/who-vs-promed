Despite giving out more than 6900 free hepatitis A vaccines last week [week of 6 May 20190], Florida saw its biggest weekly increase in new cases of the contagious liver disease. The Florida Department of Health reported an additional 92 hepatitis A cases during the week ending 11 May 2019, bringing the total since the beginning of 2019 to 1129 people. The 92 new cases -- 4 of them in South Florida -- represent the most reported in one week since the hepatitis A outbreak started in 2018.

Every county in Florida now has at least one reported case of hepatitis A. Unlike measles, which traces its spread to international travel, about 97 percent of hepatitis A cases are likely to have been acquired in Florida, according to health officials.

The contagious virus spreads through the feces of people, primarily when they don't wash their hands after using the bathroom. The feces can transfer to objects, food, drinks, or drugs. Sometimes, it is spread by infected restaurant workers who touch food before it is served. Drug use is the most commonly identified risk factor. Symptoms includes sudden nausea and vomiting, fatigue, loss of appetite, low grade fever, dark urine, and joint pain.

While hepatitis A typically is not considered fatal, more than a thousand people in Florida have been hospitalized since 1 Jan 2018, because of their hepatitis A infection, and 18 have died, according to the Florida Department of Health. As the number of new cases climbs, health officials are stepping up efforts to vaccinate the at-risk population in Florida. Groups that are considered high-risk are people in jail, the homeless, and drug users and men who have sex with other men. In the last month alone, the Florida Department Health has vaccinated more than 5000 people a week who are uninsured or under-insured.

The virus, spread from person to person, can live on a surface and spread when someone touches that surface and puts their hand in their mouth. "The disease is very hardy," said Carina Blackmore, the Florida Department of Health's state epidemiologist. "It can survive in the environment for long periods of time." Health officials urge good hand washing but say they best protection is vaccination.

What began as a spike in reported hepatitis A cases in Aiken county has now spread to other parts of South Carolina, prompting state public health officials [Mon 13 May 2019] to declare a statewide outbreak. Since 1 Nov 2019, the state has recorded 86 reported cases of the contagious disease, more than 4 times what state officials normally expect to see, a state health official said Mon 13 May 2019. Most have occurred in Aiken county, and almost half of all cases involve individuals who reported drug use, said State Epidemiologist Linda Bell. Over the last 10 years, South Carolina averaged 19 reported cases of hepatitis A annually.

Bell, though, cautioned the general population need not "be overly concerned about" the surge in people across the state contracting the virus. "But we are seeing cases higher that what we expect to see," Bell said. "And so it's important for us to do our prevention efforts early to reach those high-risk groups, get them vaccinated ... so that we can prevent" a severe outbreak.

As part of its outreach, DHEC [Department of Health and Environmental Control] says it is offering no-cost vaccines to groups the agency has identified as high risk, which are drug users, homeless, formerly incarcerated and sexually active gay men, according to DHEC. Additionally, health officials recommend all children get 2 doses of the vaccine as part of their immunization schedule.

The surge in hepatitis A cases statewide coincides with a national outbreak that began in 2016. But the outbreak is worse in other states, Bell said. "Many of those states are seeing hundreds to, some states, thousands of cases of hepatitis A."

Of the 86 reported cases in South Carolina, 59 have led to hospitalization and one resulted in death, according to the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control.

State public health officials in February 2019 declared an outbreak in Aiken county after an employee at a second restaurant in Aiken tested positive for the virus, according to DHEC. Bell, though, stressed transmission by food or beverage is uncommon. "Most transmission in the United States is through person-to-person contact," Bell said. "Good hygiene -- diligently washing your hands -- is a good way to prevent hepatitis A, as well as not sharing personal items," including drug equipment, she said, adding the state has received reports of hepatitis A from people using various drugs, "everything from marijuana to meth."

Officials with the New Mexico Department of Health have announced that a 2nd person has died in association with the recent hepatitis A outbreak. The department has confirmed 103 cases of hepatitis A in adults ages 19 to 64 in Bernalillo county since October 2018 in addition to 1 confirmed case in Santa Fe county.

Officials say the virus primarily impacts people who use injection and non-injection drugs as well as people experiencing homelessness.

Hepatitis A is a contagious liver disease. It can be mild, lasting a few weeks to a severe illness spanning many months. It is contracted when a person ingest fecal matter from contact with objects, food, or drinks contaminated with feces of an infected person. "Vaccinating people a risk of exposure is the most effective tool we have to prevent the spread of hepatitis A infection during an outbreak," said New Mexico Department of Health Secretary Kathy Kunkel.

[Kentucky still leads the pack of increasing numbers of states with outbreaks of hepatitis A (https://chfs.ky.gov/agencies/dph/dehp/idb/Pages/hepAoutbreak.aspx) with, as of 27 Apr 2019, 4594 cases and 53 deaths.

As the numbers of cases continue to rise in a number of states, and news of smaller (so far) outbreaks occur in others, the question at the end of ProMED post 20190104.6241686 by a Kentucky official, "This is a disease of developing countries. One has to ask: Why are we seeing it in the USA?" is more and more relevant. We are seeing these outbreaks because of the inability to deal with marginalized populations among their midst. The dramatic cutbacks in public health infrastructure in some of these states clearly feed the fire of these outbreaks. They must be addressed by bolstering public health resources and education and directly addressing the needs of these marginalized populations. - Mod.LL
