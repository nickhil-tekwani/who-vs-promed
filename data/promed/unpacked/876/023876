Summary
-------
Background. A recombinant, replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccine expressing a surface glycoprotein of Zaire Ebolavirus (rVSV-ZEBOV) is a promising Ebola vaccine candidate. We report the results of an interim analysis of a trial of rVSV-ZEBOV in Guinea, West Africa.

Methods. For this open-label, cluster-randomised ring vaccination trial, suspected cases of Ebola virus disease in Basse-Guinea (Guinea, West Africa) were independently ascertained by Ebola response teams as part of a national surveillance system. After laboratory confirmation of a new case, clusters of all contacts and contacts of contacts were defined and randomly allocated 1:1 to immediate vaccination or delayed (21 days later) vaccination with rVSV-ZEBOV (one dose of 2 x 10^7 plaque-forming units, administered intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle). Adults (age greater than 18 years) who were not pregnant or breastfeeding were eligible for vaccination. Block randomisation was used, with randomly varying blocks, stratified by location (urban vs rural) and size of rings (greater than 20 vs less than 20 individuals). The study is open label and masking of participants and field teams to the time of vaccination is not possible, but Ebola response teams and laboratory workers were unaware of allocation to immediate or delayed vaccination. Taking into account the incubation period of the virus of about 10 days, the prespecified primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed Ebola virus disease with onset of symptoms at least 10 days after randomisation. The primary analysis was per protocol and compared the incidence of Ebola virus disease in eligible and vaccinated individuals in immediate vaccination clusters with the incidence in eligible individuals in delayed vaccination clusters. This trial is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, number PACTR201503001057193.

Findings. Between 1 Apr 2015 and 20 Jul 2015, 90 clusters, with a total population of 7651 people, were included in the planned interim analysis. 48 of these clusters (4123 people) were randomly assigned to immediate vaccination with rVSV-ZEBOV, and 42 clusters (3528 people) were randomly assigned to delayed vaccination with rVSV-ZEBOV.

In the immediate vaccination group, there were no cases of Ebola virus disease with symptom onset at least 10 days after randomisation, whereas in the delayed vaccination group there were 16 cases of Ebola virus disease from 7 clusters, showing a vaccine efficacy of 100 percent (95 percent CI 74.7-100.0; p=0.0036). No new cases of Ebola virus disease were diagnosed in vaccinees from the immediate or delayed groups from 6 days post-vaccination. At the cluster level, with the inclusion of all eligible adults, vaccine effectiveness was 75.1 percent (95 percent CI -7.1 to 94.2; p=0.1791), and 76.3 percent (95 percent CI -15.5 to 95.1; p=0.3351) with the inclusion of everyone (eligible or not eligible for vaccination). 43 serious adverse events were reported; 1 serious adverse event was judged to be causally related to vaccination (a febrile episode in a vaccinated participant, which resolved without sequelae). Assessment of serious adverse events is ongoing.

Interpretation. The results of this interim analysis indicate that rVSV-ZEBOV might be highly efficacious and safe in preventing Ebola virus disease, and is most likely effective at the population level when delivered during an Ebola virus disease outbreak via a ring vaccination strategy.

Funding. WHO, with support from the Wellcome Trust (UK); Medecins Sans Frontieres; the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the Research Council of Norway; and the Canadian Government through the Public Health Agency of Canada, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, International Development Research Centre, and Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development.

[Further excerpted from paper referred to above: The vaccine is a recombinant, replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus [VSV]-based, expressing the glycoprotein of a Zaire Ebolavirus (rVSV-ZEBOV). It causes a transient systemic infection after a single injection, and produces a rapid immune response against the Ebola virus surface. The trial was designed to test whether 1 dose of rVSV-ZEBOV candidate vaccine administered by intramuscular injection to adult contacts and contacts of contacts of patients with confirmed Ebola virus disease can provide protection against the development of laboratory-confirmed Ebola virus disease. The results of this interim analysis interim analysis of the Guinea Phase III efficacy vaccine trial show that VSV-EBOV (Merck, Sharp & Dohme) is highly effective, infection can be established quickly, and most likely effective at the population level when delivered during an outbreak using a ring vaccination strategy. ...

The data and safety monitoring board has advised that the trial should be continued to expand the evidence on vaccine effectiveness and safety, but that randomisation should be stopped and [the investigators] should continue with immediate vaccination of new clusters. As of 24 Jul 2015, approval from the national regulatory authority of Guinea and from relevant ethics review committees has been granted to implement this recommendation.

[Abstract. A World Health Organization expert meeting on Ebola vaccines proposed urgent safety and efficacy studies in response to the outbreak in West Africa. One approach to communicable disease control is ring vaccination of individuals at high risk of infection due to their social or geographical connection to a known case. This paper describes the protocol for a novel cluster randomised controlled trial design which uses ring vaccination.

In the Ebola ca suffit [Ebola that is enough] ring vaccination trial, rings are randomised 1:1 to (a) immediate vaccination of eligible adults with single dose vaccination or (b) vaccination delayed by 21 days. Vaccine efficacy against disease is assessed in participants over equivalent periods from the day of randomisation. Secondary objectives include vaccine effectiveness at the level of the ring, and incidence of serious adverse events.

Ring vaccination trials are adaptive, can be run until disease elimination, allow interim analysis, and can go dormant during inter-epidemic periods. ... - more]

[Note that ring vaccination is a disease-control strategy that was used to control smallpox until the last naturally occurring case in 1977. - Mod.LK]

http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/31/health-ebola-vaccine-alternatives-idUSL5N10B3IW20150731?rpc=401
[Scientists and drug companies will continue to research the potential of alternative Ebola vaccines, despite a shot from Merck and NewLink Genetics proving 100 percent effective in a trial in Guinea.

Experts said on Fri [31 Jul 2015] different kinds of vaccines were needed that might be better suited for different population groups.

Because Merck's VSV-ZEBOV is a live, or replicating, vaccine, there were initial worries about its safety. In the event, it proved about as safe as a flu vaccine, said University of Reading virologist Ben Neuman, but it was still not given to children or pregnant women.

Replicating vaccines have the advantage of requiring only one dose, making them suitable for emergency use. But non-replicating vaccines, which may need 2 injections, could be longer-lasting and better suited to protecting people outside an epidemic.]

[It is important that evaluation of alternative vaccine approaches continue since it is not known how some population groups will react to the rVSV-vectored vaccine, nor how long protection lasts. - Mod.LK]

Ebola Experts Caution: Vaccine Still Months Away
------------------------------------------------
Ebola experts hailed the development of a "highly effective" Ebola vaccine, but they are cautioning that widespread availability of the vaccine is still months away.

World Health Organization expert Marie-Paule Kieny told reporters that the vaccine may indeed avert major epidemics in the future, but warned that it will be a while longer before the shot is approved by regulators.

The WHO's Ebola response coordinator in Guinea, Mohammed Belhocine, said the development should be celebrated, but people should not let their guard drop yet.

And Guinea's top government response coordinator, Sakoba Keita, has expressed hope that an effective vaccine could lessen the stigma against Ebola sufferers and their families. ... - more

[It certainly would be a good test of the vaccine if the trial could be moved to Sierra Leone where more than 600 contact cases are being monitored. But clearly there are many hurdles before that can happen. - Mod.LK]

[The stunning apparent success of this vaccine and testing strategy (the lower statistical bound of protection is nearly 75%) is a vindication of the imperative for the adoption of clinical trials during outbreak situations, a strategy long endorsed by the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) https://isaric.tghn.org. Also espoused in an excellent editorial published one year ago by Jeremy Farrar, David Heymann and Peter Piot entitled "Experimental Medicine in a Time of Ebola".
