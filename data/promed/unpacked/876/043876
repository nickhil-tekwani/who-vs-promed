We confirm that all three patients living in Rio de Janeiro and suspected
of [having yellow fever infection, with an history of visiting endemic
areas at the Amazon and Goiania (Goias state) have been found today
negative in our laboratory. The only case positive so far, remains a girl
who spent some days in a National Park at the north of the state of Goias,
an endemic area for yellow fever which seems to be active at the moment.
Seven other people who travel with her to the area and which show no
symptoms, has been also found today negative for yellow fever infection.
An active surveillance of possible cases of yellow fever infections has
been implemented in the city as well as the vaccination of the people
living close to the yellow fever case in Rio de Janeiro and vector control
measures in the area.

One more suspect case of yellow fever (YF) has been reported by the Rio de

patient is a 20-year-old male resident of Cuiaba (Mato Grosso State) who
came to Rio on 27 Dec 1999 to spend time with family. On 6 Jan 2000 he
developed symptoms & was admitted to a hospital in the center of Rio. The
case was notified to the Municipal Health Secretariat on the afternoon of
17 Jan 2000. Laboratory results are expected in 2 days.
Larval & adult mosquito collections are being made in Santa Teresa and in
the hospital treating the patient.
The Secretariat also reported that the 4 previous suspect cases have tested
negative for YF [see above report: aged 30 in Ipanema, aged 30 in Campo
Grande, aged 47 in Meier and aged 30 in Itanhanga.

[ProMED-mail's sources in the University Hospital of Rio de Janeiro report
that the suspect case admitted there was transferred from another public
hospital in Rio with a preliminary diagnosis of fever of unknown origin. As
soon as the low platelet count was found on routine examination, the
patient was transferred to an air conditioned room with sealed windows (to
avoid mosquito entry) and a blood sample was sent for YF & dengue testing.
The YF test was negative, the dengue test is pending. Many people were
seen receiving YF vaccination in the University Hospital today.
[If patients in Brazil have hemorrhagic fevers and they are not infected
with YF virus, with what are they infected? - Mod.CHC
