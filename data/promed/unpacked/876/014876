Laboratory investigation has shown that the infection of poultry in Zoeterwoude [South Holland, see archive no 20141130.3000468] was caused by the HPAI H5N8 variant. The farm's animal population was culled on Sun 30 Nov 2014.

There is one poultry farm within the 1 km [0.6 mi] zone around the infected flock. In view of HPAI H5N8 confirmation, all animals in that adjacent farm have been preventively culled today (1 Dec 2014). Their number was about 50 000 birds.

Within a 10 km [6 mi] zone around the outbreak, there are 3 farms. 2 of them do not keep poultry; the 3rd one, with poultry, is being investigated at present.
