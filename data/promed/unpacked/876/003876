Lethal maize disease spreads
----------------------------
A deadly maize disease that was 1st reported in Kenya and Tanzania has spread to Uganda, raising food security concerns. In Tanzania, the disease was reported in Mwanza. The [Ugandan] Ministry of Agriculture warned that Maize Lethal Necrosis (MLN) had been reported in some districts in eastern Uganda, particularly Busia and Tororo.

The disease can cause up to 100 percent crop loss. It is suspected to be spread by beetles, thrips and leaf hoppers.

Uganda scientists are working in collaboration with International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre [CIMMYT] to find solutions to the disease. CIMMYT is also working with the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (Kari) to develop maize varieties that are resistant to the disease. MLN attacks all maize varieties.

Farmers have been advised to practise crop rotation and skip planting maize for at least a year, [and] not to replant seeds from the previous harvest. Other measures recommended include weed control, proper use of fertiliser and high quality seeds to boost production.

[Maize lethal necrosis (MLN) is caused by co-infection of _Maize chlorotic mottle virus_ (MCMV, genus _Machlomovirus_), transmitted by chrysomelid beetle vectors, and either _Maize dwarf mosaic virus_ (MDMV, genus _Potyvirus_) or _Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV, genus _Tritimovirus_). MLN has been reported from the Americas and some locations in Europe. The finding in Kenya was the 1st report of MLN as well as MCMV in Africa.

WSMV has not been reported from Africa, but MDMV is known to occur in the region. MDMV is closely related to _Sugarcane mosaic virus_ (SCMV, genus _Potyvirus_), also present in the area, and both are transmitted by a number of aphid species. SCMV has been reported as the co-infecting potyvirus in Kenya, but transmission in maize seed was previously only reported for MDMV, and not SCMV. However, seed transmission of the maize disease in Rift valley has been claimed (see ProMED-mail post 20120614.1167465). Therefore the 2 viruses involved in Kenya may be MCMV and either MDMV (undifferentiated from SCMV in the diagnosis) or a new strain of SCMV that can be seed transmitted in maize.

Symptoms of the individual viruses are synergistically enhanced in MLN and may include leaf mottling and necrosis, distortion of ears, absence of kernels, failure to produce tassels, as well as stunting, premature aging, and death of plants. Symptoms may disappear during the growing season leaving plants with latent infections but reduced yield as virus reservoirs and making disease monitoring difficult. Infectious vector insects may be carried by wind over long distances. Disease management may include crop rotation, certified clean seeds, control of vector species and weedy reservoir hosts, and use of crop cultivars or hybrids with reduced sensitivity to the viruses. A resistance breeding programme has been set up in Kenya screening a large set of diverse pre-commercial hybrids from CIMMYT and other public and private institutions.

A number of, most likely secondary or opportunistic, fungal pathogens in the diseased maize have also been reported in Kenya (ProMED-mail posts 20120117.1012452 and 20120326.1080612), which are further affecting crop health and yield.
