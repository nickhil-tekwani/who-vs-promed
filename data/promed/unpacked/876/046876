Infected pigs killed in South Korea
------------------------------------
SEOUL: Authorities have started slaughtering pigs showing symptoms
of foot-and-mouth disease at a farm in central South Korea. The
country has already slaughtered tens of thousands of farm animals in a
bid to contain the deadly livestock epidemic. Authorities have been
struggling to allay international concerns about the possible spread of
the highly contagious disease during the soccer World Cup, which
opened on Fri 31 May 2002. South Korea is co-hosting the month-long
tournament with Japan.
Officials have slaughtered one pig which tested positive for foot-and-
mouth along with 30 others showing symptoms of the disease at the
farm in Pyongtaek, 100km south of Seoul, said Choi Myung-chul, of
the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry. Authorities would carry out
more tests to confirm the infection before they slaughtered all 1500 pigs
on the farm, he said.
Since South Korea's first outbreak in early May, authorities have
slaughtered almost 110 000 head of livestock in an effort to eradicate
the disease before the World Cup. Farms in Ansung, Jinchon and
Yongin districts, near Pyongtaek, have been most affected.
Japan has expressed concerns that the disease may be transmitted via
food or carried on shoes when tens of thousands of soccer fans travel
between the two countries during the World Cup. South Korea has
called the concerns "groundless," as outbreaks have been restricted to
districts some distance from tournament venues. The nearest World
Cup city is Suwon, 40km north of the affected region.
Soldiers and health officials have been fumigating farms and vehicles
entering and exiting affected areas.
