UF scientists concerned about impact of rust found in sentinel plot
--------------------------------------------------
Asian soybean rust [ASR], a crop-killing disease first detected in the
United States during the fall of 2004, was found near Citra this week on
soybeans in a University of Florida "sentinel plot" planted early to detect
the fungus.
It was one of 2 findings this week that mark the 1st appearances of soybean
rust on U.S. soybeans during the typical growing season, and University of
Florida (UF) researchers fear the discovery signals the beginning of
outbreaks that may devastate the nation's $16-billion soybean industry.
ASR was found by Jim Walker, a biological scientist with the Florida
Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Division of Plant
Industry, which has been monitoring the plots in cooperation with UF's
Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences [UF/IFAS]. On Thu [1 Jul 2005],
a Department of Plant Industry [DPI] laboratory confirmed that the pathogen
was ASR, said David Wright, a UF/IFAS professor of agronomy in Quincy.
The other discovery was made Tuesday [5 July 2005] on a sentinel plot in
Baldwin County, Wright said. Previously, ASR was found in Florida and other
southern states after the 2004 growing season ended. The crop is typically
planted in the spring and produces soybeans in the summer and early fall.
"There's a lot at stake now, and nobody really knows what will happen,"
Wright said. "But if there are major problems, it will affect a lot of people."
Losses from ASR, which kills up to 95 percent of infected plants, could
drive up prices on products ranging from margarine and peanut butter to
livestock feed and biodiesel fuel, he said.
Florida officials hope their work with rust will help farmers further north.
UF and state agricultural experts have joined a nationwide effort to help
farmers protect this year's crop, estimated at 74 million acres, Wright
said. Soybeans are grown in 31 states, with heaviest production in the Midwest.
By monitoring sentinel plots at 26 Florida sites, Wright and other
scientists at UF's North Florida Research and Education Center in Quincy
hope to provide data on disease development, distribution and other factors
that could assist farmers in northern areas of the nation, Wright said. The
project is funded by the USDA and the North Central Soybean Research
Program, a consortium representing higher education institutions in the 31
soybean-producing U.S. states.
Many growers are concerned about being caught off-guard by ASR, because the
fungus, known as _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_, is spread by tiny spores that can
travel hundreds of miles on air currents, he said.
"The fungus also matures very quickly," Wright said. "Once a spore lands on
a host plant it can produce new spores in 9 days."
Despite its name, ASR attacks more than 30 species of legumes, a plant
family that includes beans, peas and clover, he said. On soybeans, it
causes infected leaves to develop small brownish spots, then turn yellow
and fall off.
Fungicides control the disease in South America, where ASR arrived in 2001,
Wright said. But U.S. farmers fear the sprays could cut profits. Fungicide
treatments for an acre of soybeans would cost $10 to $30 per year, he said.
Protecting the entire U.S. crop could total more than $1 billion. "Soybeans
have a low profit margin, probably $25 to $50 per acre," Wright said. "So
there's not much room for new expenses."
To determine which fungicides work best under Florida's growing conditions,
UF researchers are conducting field trials of about 20 products, said Jim
Marois, a UF plant pathologist. The trials, held at the Quincy center, will
also investigate application methods.
"Growers prefer the lowest-priced products that work," Marois said. "We
want to help them make informed choices."
UF researchers will also investigate tilling methods that bury old plant
residue, a practice that could prevent dormant spores from starting new
outbreaks, he said.
"This method will only work against spores that survive the winter here,
and we're not sure that will happen," Marois said. "We hope not, because
then we'll only have outbreaks if spores arrive from other countries."
Native to Asia, ASR is believed to have reached the United States in
September 2004 when winds from Hurricane Ivan transported spores from
Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay in South America.
Concerns about international terrorism spurred U.S. preparations for ASR,
Marois said. In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 disaster, it was identified
as a possible bioterrorism agent, which led to the development of federal
programs to identify and respond to the disease.
"We've had a very coordinated effort," Marois said. "Although nobody's
happy soybean rust is here, the silver lining is that we're learning more
about how we can take a nationwide approach to crop diseases."
Florida will be a critical state in the fight against ASR, said X.B. Yang,
a professor of plant pathology at Iowa State University in Ames. "What
happens in Florida may well determine the risk level for Midwest states,"
said Yang, who is part of an Iowa group collaborating with UF researchers.
"Information generated by UF scientists is essential for receive our RUST

"What happens in Florida may well determine the risk level for Midwest
states," said Yang, who is part of an Iowa group collaborating with UF
researchers. "Information generated by UF scientists is essential for
colleagues in the north."

[The use of sentinel plants at many locations is providing useful
information on distribution of ASR in the affected areas. There are no
commercial soybean cultivars that can be deployed to control ASR, so
application of approved chemical fungicides is the only option available to
soybean producers. As indicated by Wright, increased costs for fungicides
may adversely affect profit margins. - Mod.DH]
