Several persons of Mallikeswara village in Ganjam district are suffering from a mysterious disease. At least 15 new cases were reported on Friday [8 Nov 2013]. The symptoms of the disease match those of chikungunya, but this can only be confirmed after laboratory testing, doctors said on Saturday [9 Nov 2013].

A team of doctors led by district malaria officer U S Mishra along with paramedics went to the affected village in Khallikote block on Friday [8 Nov 2013]. They treated patients and collected blood samples. "We conducted a door-to-door survey and collected 38 blood samples from the village. All of them tested negative for malaria," said Mishra. "The samples will be tested at the laboratory of MKCG Medical College and Hospital here for chikungunya [virus or antibody?]," he added.

The disease broke out a week back. Villagers panicked when 2 persons died recently. The health department, however, allayed the fears. "The deaths of the 2 were not related to the disease. The deceased were old men," said the malaria officer. He said the situation in the village is under control, and no new cases were reported on Saturday [9 Nov 2013].

The main reason for the spread of chikungunya, malaria, and dengue is stagnant water, said a doctor of the social medicine department of MKCG.

[Chikungunya virus is endemic in India, and cases appear sporadically in diverse locations, such as Odisha state. This is the 2nd reported chikungunya virus outbreak in the Ganjam district of Odisha state this year (2013), the earlier one having occurred in early January 2013. That outbreak may have been a continuation of the 2012 outbreak in the same locality. If the chikungunya virus vector mosquitoes, _Aedes aegypti_, are present, as is likely, the occurrence of additional cases can be expected unless the vector control efforts are effective. There is no commercially available chikungunya virus vaccine.
