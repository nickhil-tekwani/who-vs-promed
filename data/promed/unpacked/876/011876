Carbapenem-resistant organisms have been detected in 3 patients at the National Burns Centre, based at Middlemore Hospital. Admissions to the National Burns Centre in south Auckland have been limited after a "highly unusual" multi-drug resistant organism infected 3 patients.

The 1st case -­ which is thought to have been acquired overseas ­- was detected in a patient at the centre on [10 Dec 2017]. Infection control measures were put in place, but a 2nd patient was found to be infected with the same organism on [9 Jan 2018]. A 3rd patient was identified on [3 Feb 2018].

The bug is a carbapenem-resistant organism, or CRO. Carbapenems are a powerful group of antibiotics, which are used for infections where other antibiotics have failed. "Whilst this is not a concern for most of our patients or the visiting public, CROs can have serious implications for patients such as burns patients."

Counties Manukau Health's acting chief medical officer Vanessa Thornton said. "We are taking all the necessary steps to ensure these cases are contained, managed, and eliminated before they spread further." Multi-drug resistant organisms were often detected in hospital patients, but this was quite a unique bug, she said. It was of particular concern because of the patients' vulnerability. All 3 infected patients were now in isolation, and one theatre had been reserved for their exclusive use, she said. "Restricting the transfer of patients to the burns/ICU [care complex] is a crucial step in eradicating these organisms."

The National Burns Centre is located at Middlemore Hospital in Manukau and cares for the most severe burn patients from around the country. Thornton said Counties Manukau Health was asking patients to be held in regional burns centres until it was confident the risk was "contained". It was also looking at transferring "very serious" burns cases, which would normally be treated at the national centre to Australia. "This would be on a case-by-case basis." There were "stringent" measures in place to eliminate the CROs, Thornton said.

[Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that includes ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive, but otherwise multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, such as those that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or AmpC beta-lactamases, which are enzymes that destroy most beta-lactams, except for the carbapenems.

Resistance to carbapenems commonly is the result of an organism acquiring the ability to produce carbapenemases, enzymes that destroy the carbapenems, as well as frequently most other beta-lactam antibiotics. Other resistance mechanisms, which include reduced affinity of penicillin-binding protein (PBPs) for carbapenems, increased efflux of the beta-lactam antibiotics, or decreased permeability of the outer membrane due to loss of outer membrane porin channels, may be combined with high-level production of the carbapenemase.

There are several distinct types of carbapenemases:
- KPCs (_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases such as KPC-1, -2, -3, -4, etc.);
- Metallo-beta-lactamases, such as New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamases (such as, NDM-1, 2, -3, -4, -5, etc.), IMP and VIM (Verona Integron-encoded Metallo-beta-lactamase);
- OXA-types (oxacillin-hydrolyzing carbapenemases).

Many of the carbapenemases are encoded on plasmids, which can facilitate spread of resistance genes among organisms of the same species or even different bacterial species. The plasmids frequently carry genes that confer resistance to multiple other classes of antibiotics, so that these organisms have been susceptible only to toxic or otherwise suboptimal antibiotics, such as colistin and tigecycline.

In 2015, limited spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CREs) was reported in several New Zealand hospitals. Before 2015, all the patients identified to be colonised or infected with CREs had a history of recent overseas travel or hospitalization (https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/antimicrobial-resistance/minimising-antimicrobial-resistance-information-health-professionals/carbapenem-resistant-enterobacteriaceae).

A report that summarized Enterobacteriaceae isolates with acquired carbapenemases (CPE) in New Zealand between 2009, when the 1st isolate was identified, and 2014 can be found at: https://surv.esr.cri.nz/PDF_surveillance/Antimicrobial/ACE/2014Carbap.pdf and its findings are extracted below:

Carbapenemases belonging to each of the 3 major classes have now been identified among CPE in New Zealand. Over the 6-year period, 2009-2014, a total of 35 distinct CPE have been isolated from 30 patients. 3 patients had 2 or more isolates with different carbapenemases types.

Recent overseas travel and hospitalisation history was reported for the patients from whom 32 of the total 35 CPE were isolated. All the patients from whom these 32 CPE were isolated had recently been overseas, with 81.3 percent (26/32) of the CPE being isolated from patients who had been in the Indian subcontinent. All the patients with KPC and OXA-48-like carbapenemases, who were reported to have recently been overseas, had been hospitalised while overseas. However, only 11 of the 18 patients with NDM carbapenemases, who were reported to have been overseas, were hospitalised while overseas. The remaining seven patients with NDM carbapenemases had all been in India, where NDMs are reported to be widespread in the environment.

Based on the epidemiological data available, there was no evidence of any transmission of CPE in New Zealand healthcare facilities at the time. Most CPE have been isolated during admission screening of patients at risk of having multidrug-resistant organisms. Only 14.3 percent (5/35) of the CPE were isolated from clinical specimens: 4 from urine specimens and one from an endotracheal aspirate.

Counties Manukau Health, with an estimated population in 2016 of 534 750 residents, refers to the southern area of Auckland, New Zealand, without universally agreed boundaries (http://countiesmanukau.health.nz/about-us/our-region/). Auckland is the largest urban area in the country, with an urban population of around 1.5 million residents that is located on the North Island (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland).
