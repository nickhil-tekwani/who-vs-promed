Measles was endemic in Brazil before 2000 and caused large outbreaks every 2 or 3 years. Although measles was eliminated in Brazil in 2000, cases have continued to be imported.

During 2001-2014, the median annual number of measles cases reported in Brazil was 50 (range 2-712). The median annual number of Brazilian states with reported cases was 2.5 (range 1-7). Since elimination, the highest numbers of cases reported in Brazil occurred in 2013 (220) and in 2014 (712). According to the Pan American Health Organization, endemic transmission is reestablished when epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicate that a chain of transmission of a virus strain has continued uninterrupted for over 12 months in a defined geographic area.

From 2 Dec 2013 through 31 Dec 2014 in the state of Ceara, Brazil, 681 measles cases were reported. A measles case was considered confirmed when a patient exhibited fever, rash, and more than one of 3 symptoms and signs (i.e., cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis); was positive for IgM and negative for IgG against measles virus; and had not been vaccinated in the previous 21 days. D8 genotype, the same virus genotype that was circulating in Europe, was the only genotype identified, and how the virus was introduced into the region was not clear.

From 2000 to 2013, vaccine coverage among children 12 months of age remained over 95 percent in Ceara, although that coverage was not homogeneous for the whole state. In 14.7 percent (27/184) of municipalities, the vaccination coverage was much lower. Pernambuco, the state that borders southern Ceara, reported a measles outbreak with 222 confirmed cases from March 2013 through March 2014. Thus, the timing of the 2 outbreaks overlapped.

------------------------------
A) Cases and genotypes identified, by year.
B) Spatial distribution of measles outbreaks in the states of Pernambuco and Ceara during 2013-2014, in which only genotype D8 was identified. Genotypes B3 and D4, observed during 2013-2014, were reported in other Brazilian states. The cities with the highest number of cases are highlighted on the map, as well as the evolution of its outbreak, which had 2 waves with peaks in the text Figure. Measles cases reported in Brazil after elimination, 2001-2014.

A) Cases and genotypes identified, by year.
B) Spatial distribution of measles outbreaks in the states of Pernambuco and Ceara during 2013-2014.

During December 2013-December 2014, Ceara's outbreak seemed to evolve in 2 waves: the 1st from epidemiologic weeks 3 through 6 (mainly in Fortaleza, the capital of Ceara) and the 2nd from epidemiologic weeks 27 through 53 (mainly on the northwest side of Ceara, an economically disadvantaged region, which also included the capital). Cases were confirmed in 15.8 percent (29/184) of all municipalities. Most patients (47.3 percent; 322) were from Fortaleza, followed by Massape (18.6 percent; 127) and Sobral (12.2 percent; 83) (Illustrated by text Figure).

Children under 12 months of age were the most affected group (27.5 percent; 187), followed by patients 20-29 years (19.2 percent; 131) and those 15-19 years (14.4 percent; 98). The age distribution was significantly different between Fortaleza and the 2 inner cities (together), with more cases reported among those under 12 months of age (37.6 percent [121/322] vs. 14.3 percent [30/210], respectively) and for those 15-29 years (25.2 percent [81/322] vs. 43.8 percent [92/210], respectively) (p under 0.001 for both comparisons) (5). Vaccination status of affected patients (data through 8 Aug 2014) was the following: unvaccinated 22.2 percent (55/252) under one year of age and 31.3 percent (79/252) over one year of age; unknown vaccination status, 27.4 percent (69/252); and received only one dose of vaccine, 18.7 percent (47/252) (8). No deaths were reported (4). The main reported symptoms were rash (100 percent), fever (100 percent), cough (84.5 percent), runny nose (68.2 percent), and conjunctivitis (60.3 percent).

Response vaccination activities have taken 10-20 weeks to be initiated in some municipalities after the 1st cases were recognized. Vaccination campaigns involving children 6-60 months of age are being intensified, and surveillance for suspected cases has increased, but as of 1 Jan 2015, the chain of transmission appeared ongoing. In addition, one cannot underestimate the fact that health professionals in Ceara had not seen cases of measles for 15 years. Younger health professionals had never seen even one case, and this lack of familiarity may have had some effect on surveillance, rapid recognition of new cases, and adoption of control measures. This difficulty of recognition should be taken into account in regions that have been free of endemic measles transmission for many years.

In conclusion, the measles outbreak in Ceara was probably imported directly from Europe or from there through the bordering state of Pernambuco. Cases were concentrated in Fortaleza and the northwest region of the state. Patient age distribution was significantly different between the capital, where the infection most affected children under 12 months of age, and the inner cities, where it most affected persons 15-29 years of age. Current heterogeneous measles vaccine coverage, a delayed response, and insufficient vaccination coverage in the past, particularly in socially disadvantaged populations from the inner cities, and difficulties in the prompt recognition and surveillance of suspected cases may explain why this outbreak occurred in a population with a vaccine coverage historically over 95 percent. In addition, vaccination campaigns directed at children under 5 years of age may not have been sufficient to interrupt the outbreak because a substantial number of older persons were susceptible. Most notably, because it has lasted over 12 months, Ceara's current outbreak may represent the reestablishment of endemic transmission of measles in the Americas.

[Ceara, a state in northeastern Brazil, has a mountainous interior and a long Atlantic coastline lined with dramatic red cliffs. Fortaleza, the capital, is known for its beaches, sprawling Coco Ecological Park, on the Coco River, and the Praia de Iracema neighborhood of bars and restaurants. The Tourism Center is a former 19th-century jail with craft shops in the cells. Area: 148 826 square km. Capital: Fortaleza, Population: 8.843 million (as of 1 Jul 2014); Gross domestic product: 84.36 billion BRL [USD 23.5 billion] (2011).

Minas Gerais, with an area of 588 383 square km (a little bigger than France), is the 3rd largest Brazilian state (after Amazonas and Para); with nearly 18 million people, it is the 2nd most populated state (after Sao Paulo). The capital is Belo Horizonte (which translates as "Beautiful Horizon"); the metropolitan area of Belo Horizonte contains much of the industry of the state. The name Minas Gerais ("General Mines," or "Large Mines") is a reference to the fact that during the 18th and 19th centuries, large mines of gold and precious stones were found in the state. - Mod.CP

Measles, mumps and rubella are notifiable diseases, and healthcare professionals suspecting a case are legally required to inform the authorities. Oral fluid testing is offered to all notified cases to confirm the diagnosis. This is part of the enhanced surveillance for these vaccine preventable diseases. Recent infection is confirmed by measuring the presence of IgM antibodies or detecting viral RNA (by PCR) in the samples.

Data presented here are for the 2nd quarter of 2015 (i.e. April to June). Cases include those confirmed by oral fluid testing (IgM antibody tests and/or PCR) at the Virus Reference Department.

Since the Measles-Rubella (MR) school campaign in November 1994, the Public Health England predecessor (PHLS) has offered oral fluid testing to confirm the diagnosis on all notified cases of measles, mumps and rubella. This is part of the enhanced surveillance programme for these vaccine-preventable diseases. The table below shows only the cases confirmed by oral fluid IgM antibody tests and/or PCR in each quarter compared to the number of notified cases.

Year - 2015
Quarter - 1st
Notified - 543
Number 396

The number of measles cases in the Western Pacific Region of the World Health Organization as a whole is down significantly through the 1st 6 months of 2015 compared to the same period last year [2014]. The latest data from the UN health agency shows that this area of the Asian-Pacific region has seen a decrease in measles cases from nearly 141 000 cases from 1 Jan-30 Jun 2014 to just 104 000 for the same period this year [2015].

Some countries have seen little difference from 2014 to 2015, like China (83 205 vs 79 499), whereas other countries have seen huge differences.

The one nation that has seen a huge increase in measles this year [2015] is Mongolia. During the 1st 6 months of 2014, they reported a mere 86 cases. Contrast this to the same period in 2015, when Mongolia reported 17 580 cases, up from approximately 3000 cases reported on 31 May 2015.

This comes just a year after Mongolia was one of 4 Western Pacific countries to earn the distinction of being declared measles-free. The Measles Elimination Verification Certificate from the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office requires a case-free streak of 3 years. It has been 5 years since Mongolia reported a measles outbreak. A Mongolian media report in June [2015] described the beginning of the current outbreak.

The 1st case of measles in this recent outbreak was reported on 18 Mar 2015. 13 days later, when the Ministry of Health held a press conference, there had been 333 suspected and 95 confirmed cases, 22 of which were diagnosed in adults. Noting that this particular strain matches a strain identified in China, the Deputy Minister of Health said, after a pause: "Even a few doctors and hospital staff contracted the disease. Apparently, vaccinated people, children and adults alike, can get it, provided they have weak immunity and other chronic illness. What's worse, because we hadn't had an outbreak of measles in 5 years, the doctors in the health facilities were not accustomed to it. Added to all that is the fact that this is an airborne disease, which meant the outbreak would be quite costly."

The press conference ended with the Ministry of Health promising a nation-wide vaccination between from 15-25 May 2015, with help from the WHO regional office and UNICEF.

Other countries reporting big differences, fortunately in the opposite direction, include the Philippines and Viet Nam. The Philippines reported more than 40 000 measles cases during this period in 2014, while seeing only 2231 cases this year [2015]. Likewise, Viet Nam reported nearly 11 000 cases last year [2014] and only 888 so far this year.

A 6th person has contracted measles after an outbreak at Queensland's largest university, prompting the authorities to issue a health alert in a town more than 100 km away. A vaccination centre has been set up at the University of Queensland's St Lucia campus in Brisbane following a spate of measles cases this month [August 2015].

Queensland Health says the latest person to have contracted the highly-contagious disease on campus travelled to Toowoomba, west of Brisbane, last weekend. The infected person visited the Spotted Cow Hotel on Saturday [22 Aug 2015] night and had breakfast at Sizzler on Sunday morning.

Darling Downs Public Health Unit Director Dr Penny Hutchinson said management at both establishments had been advised of the case so they could let staff and customers know. There was potential for more cases to arise in Toowoomba from people who visited those locations, but there's no ongoing risk at either site, she said.

Dr Hutchinson urged Toowoomba residents to be alert for measles symptoms. "Symptoms usually start around 10 days, but can occur between 7 and 18 days after contact with an infectious person," Dr Hutchinson said. "This means that we could expect to see further disease cases from contact with this individual up until around 5 Sep 2015. Measles is one of the most infectious of all communicable diseases and is spread by tiny droplets through coughing and sneezing."

Measles is a viral infection that causes a fever, cough, runny nose and then a red spotty rash and sore eyes a few days later. People with symptoms should stay home and contact their GP for advice, Dr Hutchinson said.

[Brisbane is the capital of Queensland and Australia's 3rd largest city after Sydney and Melbourne. At least 100 000 university students live in Brisbane. They study with many different institutions, including 3 large universities based in the city. Brisbane's sub-tropical climate is a major draw for interstate and international students. Winters are warm enough to keep sun worshippers happy the whole year round. It is rated 2nd on the list of Australia's most livable major cities for students. St Lucia is an exclusive suburb within the City of Brisbane, Queensland. - Mod.CP

A 7th measles case within 5 weeks has been confirmed at the University of Queensland, with health authorities warning more cases may be likely. Metro North Public Health Unit (PHU) Physician Dr James Smith said the 7th case involves a student from University of Queensland's St Lucia campus who was a passenger on Singapore Airlines flight SQ235, which arrived in Brisbane at 7:00 am on Sat 15 Aug 2015.

"Measles symptoms usually start around 10 days after contact but can occur between 7 and 18 days after contact with an infectious person," Dr Smith said. "This means we expect to see further measles cases from contact with these individuals."

The PHU is advising students who are unwell to avoid the university campus, part-time work, and social events, including shopping centres, bars and parties.

"Measles is infectious for about 4 days before the rash develops," Dr Smith said. "None of the 7 cases realised they were highly infectious when on campus and in the community."

Dr Smith said early symptoms of measles are similar to the flu and other respiratory illnesses and include a fever, cough, runny nose, and dry, itchy eyes. Anyone who develops measles-like symptoms within the next week or 2 should stay home and contact their GP for advice.
