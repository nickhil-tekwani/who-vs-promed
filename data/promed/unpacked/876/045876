An outbreak of cryptosporidiosis is being associated with a private swim
club pool in Powell (Delaware County) after 60 individuals, mostly
children, became ill. The first two cases were confirmed on 28 Jul 2000.
The pool has been voluntarily closed.

[It is well known that _Cryptosporidium_ cysts are not killed by
chlorination. The usual reservoir for _Cryptosporidium_ is calves and small
rodents and somehow the pool water must have been contaminated with feces
from one or more of these animal sources or from infected humans.
