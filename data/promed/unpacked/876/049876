Another outbreak of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) or monkey fever may take a toll on the simian population in Wayanad district [Kerala state] if the authorities fail to adopt preventive measures on time, a study says. The study was conducted following the recent KFD outbreak in bonnet macaques [_Macaca radiata_] in the district, by a team led by Arun Zachariah, assistant professor, Centre for Wildlife Studies (CWS), Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (KVASU).

Promod G Krishnan, conservator of forests (wildlife), Palakkad [Kerala], ordered the study after a mass mortality of bonnet macaques was reported in the Nilambur south division of forest in December 2014 and the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (WWS) in January this year [2015]. More than 100 monkeys had perished to the disease.

"The current outbreak is a major one both in humans and simians in the non-KFD range area, raising serious questions regarding changing disease dynamics of the KFD virus," Dr Zachariah said. In the district, 9 people have succumbed to the disease so far [this year (2015)].

[Transmission of KFD virus to humans and monkeys continues in the Wayanad district of Kerala state. Six human cases were reported in the district on 11 Mar 2015, and that number of deaths has increased to 9 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150312.3225579). The mortality among bonnet macaques has been substantial. Kerala state is endemic for KFD virus, which is being actively transmitted this season. An 18 Feb 2015 report indicated that human cases there had reached 40 suspected and 18 confirmed infections in just 3 weeks. The disease occurs in humans and monkeys.

Avoidance of tick bites is a practical preventive measure, but requires educating local residents of the area about the risk of acquiring the infection and the severity of the disease. Although the virus has been isolated from 16 species of ticks, _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector. Most human cases occur during the dry season. KFD virus is a member of the _Flaviviridae_ family. Apparently, a vaccine is available for KFD but needs to be requested from NIB (National Institute of Biologicals) in Pune. However, an earlier report indicates that the vaccine is not available for use in the area above (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150416.3300726).

Additional information is available from the CDC fact sheet (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/KyasanurForestDis.pdf).
