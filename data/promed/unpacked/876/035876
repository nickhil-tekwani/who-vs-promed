Three people are battling for their lives after consuming meat from animals that died of anthrax in Mahusekwa, Marondera district. The 3 cases were picked at Chimbwanda Clinic last week and were confirmed at Mahusekwa Hospital on Monday [6 Jan 2020].

Marondera District Veterinary Officer Dr. Kramer Manyetu said, on investigation, it was established that the affected 3 people consumed meat from 2 cattle that died on [30 Dec 2019]. "No meat was still available when the affected property was visited. The 2 cattle deaths were reported at Chimbwanda West Dip Tank, which has a census of 800 cattle. The combined census for a 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) radius is 4500 cattle covering a total of 3 dip tanks, namely, Chimbwanda West (800), Chimbwanda communal area (2276) and Nyandoro (1458)," he said. Dr. Manyetu said they had secured 5000 doses required to cover the 3 dip tanks.

"Our staff and the Ministry of Health and Child care are in the area and, so far, we can confirm that it is only one homestead affected. The community has secured poles to build races on 3 dip tanks and vaccinations will start Friday [10 Jan 2020]," he said.

The Department of Veterinary Services has received 811 000 doses of anthrax vaccine from Botswana's Vaccine Institute to deal with outbreaks during the rainy season.

Anthrax is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by bacteria that normally affects animals, especially ruminants. The disease affects all warm-blooded animals, including humans. Signs of anthrax include sudden death of livestock, rapid decomposition of the bloated carcasses and tarry blood coming out of all natural openings. The blood of the carcass is brownish and does not clot. During the rainy season, the country usually experiences more anthrax outbreaks because of the rains that wash away the top soil and expose spores. [If this were the case, the spores would be washed away. The rain, following the dry season, encourages the forage to grow, and, in grazing, cattle consume significant amounts of soil, some of which might be contaminated. Also the rain floats the hydrophobic spores to the soil surface. Tabanid hatch will occur, and these blood-feeding flies will spread the infection to more cattle, increasing the risk. - Mod.MHJ]

There have been cases of farmers who get infected after eating meat from cattle that would have died of anthrax. People may also get infected thorough contact with the infected animals. "Opening an anthrax carcass will lead to formation of anthrax spores that are resistant to environmental changes, heat, cold and will contaminate the soil or area for [a significant period].

"The public should not handle, buy or eat meat that has not been inspected. Anthrax carcasses should never be opened, skinned or eaten. Instead, they should be buried deep into the ground," said Dr. Manyetu. [Preferably, they should be burnt. - Mod.MHJ]

"It is also an offense to sell to the public, meat that has not been processed in an abattoir and inspected and certified as unconditionally fit for human consumption."

Farmers were advised to report all cattle deaths to their nearest veterinary officers.

[Marondera is in the center of Mashonaland East (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marondera).

This is an update on the previous report of 2 Jan 2020 (Anthrax - Zimbabwe: (ME) cattle, human cases 20200102.6867615).

"Dip tanks" take us back to Southern Rhodesia, when a major veterinary disease control activity was tick control. Community cattle were swum through the deep pesticide at regular intervals throughout the year. This was tightly supervised. This provided a good opportunity for individual animals to be checked, pregnancy status confirmed, and generally one-on-one contact with the veterinary assistants. Thus, the census centered on these collecting points. - Mod.MHJ
