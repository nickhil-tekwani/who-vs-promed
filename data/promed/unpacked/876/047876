Cases of cholera in war-ravaged Yemen have soared past 100 000 in recent days, the WHO announced on [Thu 8 Jun 2017], as aid agencies warn that hundreds are being struck down every day by the easily preventable disease. "To date, 101 820 suspected cholera cases and 789 deaths have been reported in 19 governorates," a WHO spokesman told the Reuters news agency.

Yemen faces a perilous humanitarian situation as a civil war between Houthi insurgents and the Saudi-backed former government rages on. Al Qaeda and Islamic State have also carried out attacks in the impoverished and largely arid country bordering Saudi Arabia and Oman. In 2015 a Saudi-led coalition began launching regular air strikes against Houthi targets, during which scores of civilians were also killed, and key infrastructure in ruins.

The Director-General of the WHO, Margaret Chan, has urged international donors to stump up funds to fight the advance of preventable diseases. "Nearly 19 million people in Yemen are in desperate need of assistance," she told a conference of potential donors in April 2017. "Large swaths of the population are on the brink of famine. Between famine and death from starvation lies disease. Infections that a well-nourished body wards off become deadly in severely malnourished people, especially children and pregnant women."

Aid agency Oxfam recently called for Western and Arab states to ramp up pressure the warring sides to allow health and aid workers to access communities in need. "Yemen is on the edge of an abyss. Lives hang in the balance," said Oxfam Yemen director Sajjad Mohammed Sajid. "2 years of war have plunged the country into one of the world's worst humanitarian crises and at the risk of famine. Now it is at the mercy of a deadly and rapidly spreading cholera epidemic. Cholera is simple to treat and prevent but while the fighting continues the task is made doubly difficult."

Cholera, almost non-existent in the West, is easily treatable by keeping up food consumption and simple rehydration solutions, both of which are problematic as the country grapples with widespread food shortages and lack of access to health facilities.
