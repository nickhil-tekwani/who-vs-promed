[My comment that the first cases of AIDS were likely masked by the
'background noise' of multiple common infections in Africa provoked the

I suspect that the "background noise" of tuberculosis was even more
significant. The effects of HIV on tuberculosis in the U.S. are well
known. Patients in Africa who have AIDS are much less likely than patients
in wealthy countries to die from _Pneumocystis carinii_ infection or from
other opportunistic infections or malignancies and much more likely to die
from tuberculosis. I believe that the background high rate of death from
tuberculosis in Africa contributed to the delay in recognition of HIV.

My sense is that this is also the case with Ebola and other similar
diseases. The high level of surrounding medical and social pathology that
provides the "noise" of underdeveloped economies might well mask much
that's going on and we don't have sentinel stations around the world to
pick up what's out there.

[ProMED-mail's parent project, ProMED -- the Program for Monitoring
Emerging Diseases -- was set up by the Federation of American Scientists
specifically to promote the development of sentinel stations, but has so
far not attracted any funding. ProMED-mail itself is in a precarious
financial situation - Mod.JW ......................................jw/es
