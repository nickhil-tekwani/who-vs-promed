[It was just a matter of time for this epidemic to reverse direction back to "backyard exhibition chickens" in Los Angeles. If these angelo "exhibitors" start introducing their sick and virus shedding roosters to other flocks, and vice versa, this situation will get worse than nasty as Los Angeles is an exceptionally large city. The city proper cover 469 sq miles or 1210 sq km with a population of 13.1 million; the Los Angeles-Long Beach statistical area -- logical as it is continuous residence -- has a population of 18.7 million people. Tucked amongst all these people will be local communities with fighting cocks in their backyards and on roofs of apartment buildings. It will be complex and nasty. - Mod.MHJ
