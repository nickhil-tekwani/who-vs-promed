The outbreak of Kyasanur Forest disease [KFD], also known as monkey fever, in Malnad region of the district [Shivamogga] is showing no signs of abating, as 4 cases have now been reported from Tirthahalli taluk. The earlier cases were reported in Sagar taluk.

With this, the total number of KFD cases in the district since December 2018 has reached 62, of which 58 cases are from Aralagodu Gram Panchayat limits in Sagar taluk. Six persons from Aralagodu died during this period.

The prevalence of KFD is high every year from November to April, during which a dry spell prevails. While 4 KFD deaths and 48 cases were reported during this period in 2017-18, the toll and cases have already crossed this number this year [2019].

Of the 4 cases reported from Tirthahalli, 2 were reported from Konandur Gram Panchayat limits on [Thu 10 Jan 2019] and 2 from Singanabidare Gram Panchayat limits on [Fri 11 Jan 2019]. The cases were reported from Konandur and Singanabidare in the previous years also. In Aralagodu primary health centre, 5 fresh cases of high fever and headache, the symptoms of KFD, were reported on [Fri 11 Jan 2019], and blood samples of the patients have been sent to the laboratory for tests.

Meanwhile, the Department of Health and Family Welfare has stepped up the vaccination drive to tackle the outbreak. Since November 2018, vaccine against KFD has been administered to 46 000 people in the district that includes 11 000 in Sagar taluk, 21 500 in Tirthahalli taluk, 7500 in Hosanagar taluk, and 6000 in Sorab taluk.

Ravi Kumar S.T., Deputy Director of KFD unit, Department of Health and Family Welfare, told The Hindu that the district received 14 000 bottles of dimethyl phthalate (DMP) oil, a tick repellent, on [Fri 11 Jan 2019]. They have been sent to primary health centres in affected areas. The residents have been directed to apply DMP oil on their body prior to venturing out to work in their plantations on the forest fringes to avoid coming into contact with ticks that cause KFD.

Meanwhile, 2 monkeys were found dead in the forest near Karur village in Sagar taluk and one near Kelakere village in Tirthahalli taluk. The blood samples and viscera of the dead monkeys have been sent to the laboratory for tests. If they are tested positive for KFD, vaccine would be administered to people residing within a 5-km radius from where they were found dead.

[The outbreak of KFD is continuing, with a total of 62 cases and 6 deaths since it was 1st reported in December 2018. The human cases are linked or preceded with monkey deaths in the affected areas, although the above report does not mention history of direct contact with the dead or dying animals.

KFD virus is transmitted to the wild monkeys _Semnopithecus entellus_ and _Macaca radiate_, through the bites of infected _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ ticks. After infection, KFDv is transmitted to other ticks feeding on the infected animals.

Infection causes severe febrile illness in some monkeys. When infected monkeys die, the ticks drop from their body, thereby generating hotspots of infectious ticks that further spread the virus [http://www.searo.who.int/publications/journals/seajph/seajphv3n1p8.pdf].

After the discovery of KFD, it was mainly confined to 3 taluks (Sagar, Shikaripur and Sorab) of the Shimoga district of Karnataka until 1972. For a long time, KFD was thought to be endemic in the Shimoga district as in the recent outbreak; but serological evidence obtained during different studies suggests that KFD virus or related viruses are present in other areas of India, which include parts of the Saurashtra region in Gujarat state, forested regions west of Kolkata, West Bengal state, and the Andaman Islands.

No specific treatment for KFD is available; however, supportive therapy is important. This includes maintenance of hydration and the usual precautions for patients with bleeding disorders.

Vaccination, tick control measures, and personal protective measures against tick bites and avoidance of contact with sick or dead monkeys are the key strategies to preventing continuing KFD transmission. - Mod.UBA
