[The official report paints a somewhat disturbing picture in terms of
time lines for this outbreak vis-a-vis human and animal cases. At the
present time, the H5N1 virus can be reliably thought of as occurring
in birds 1st and then spreading to humans in rare cases.
Unfortunately, the 7th human death in Cambodia was announced on 6 Apr
2007, after a young girl fell sick on 2 Apr 2007 and died on 5 Apr
2007. Since the virus spreads from birds to humans, it is unfortunate
(and in fact impossible) that the date of the start of the outbreak
in birds was 6 Apr 2007 as indicated in the OIE report above, if
indeed this closely co-located outbreak was the source of the
13-year-old girl's infection. One would have expected an earlier date
than 2 Apr 2007 for the onset of the outbreak. But it appears as if
the outbreak started the day after the 13-year-old girl died.
Certainly, it is possible that the source of the infection was
another outbreak at an earlier time, say late March 2007, that has
not been officially reported, but the net effect in terms of
surveillance data in animals is disturbing. Again, outbreaks in birds
happen before human cases, not the reverse order, if animal health
surveillance systems are operating efficiently.
A map of the outbreak area can be seen in the full OIE report (access
through OIE/WAHID website given above). A more detailed map can be
