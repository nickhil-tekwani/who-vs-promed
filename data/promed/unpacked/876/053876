Re: The guidance included in the moderator's comment
----------------------------------------------------
I would argue that the guidance given under the report (about
avoiding swimming) is probably excessive.

Swimming is a good, healthy form of exercise. Molluscum contagiosum
[MC] is a fairly harmless and self-limiting infection. Excluding
people from swimming is stigmatising, especially if it is because
they have (and will be perceived by others as having) an infectious
disease. Banning individuals with MC from swimming may do more harm
than good, and it's not clear to me that there is an evidence base
for the recommendation.

It might make more sense to recommend that people with impaired
immunity (especially impaired cellular immunity) who are at
particular risk of wart and molluscum infections to avoid swimming.

In any case: How many people with MC know they have MC? If only a
minority, then instructions that you shouldn't swim if you have MC
will be ineffective. I don't know if this is the case with MC, but it
is certainly the case with "verrucas" (or "verrucae" if you're
classically minded). (I did a fairly extensive literature review on
this a few years ago, and could find no evidence that banning
children with verrucas from swimming would significantly reduce their
transmission, but in contrast considerable evidence that it would
provide only a false sense of security, and make swimming pool
managers feel that they "could be seen to have done something",
albeit something of no significant value.)

Is it clear that this "outbreak" is actually a genuine outbreak,
rather than an artifact caused by enhanced case-finding? -- that is,
that quite a lot of children have MC, and they've been identified as
part of the response to a report of a case at a pool; but that there
is no causal link between swimming and MC?

[Dr Peter English's comment's have merit and deserve attention. The
guidance included as part of my Moderator's comment was in fact
extracted in abbreviated form from the US Department of Health and
Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
website: Information for Specific Groups and Settings: Swimming Pools
and Molluscum
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/molluscum/swimming/index.htm>).

The guidance seems over-restrictive in view of the fact that
molluscum contagiosum virus is not transmitted through swimming pool
water. This was recognised by the authorities who closed the swimming
pool in Alhama, Spain, and no doubt the pool will reopen following
exclusion of affected swimmers. - Mod.CP]
