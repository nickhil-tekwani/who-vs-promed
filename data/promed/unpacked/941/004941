Norwalk-like Virus Outbreak in Hong Kong Forces Closure of Irish
Oyster Farm
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A shellfish company that supplies some of the world's top restaurants
said it was devastated by the outbreak of the "winter-vomiting" bug [a
loose term embracing viruses classified in the "Norwalk-like virus"
genus of the family _Caliciviridae_. - Mod-CP in Hong Kong which
was traced to contaminated Irish oysters [from oyster farms in Cork
Harbour, where a sewage outfall is believed to have contributed to
water quality pollution in the north channel.
As a public health precaution, the Department of Marine slapped a ban
on shellfish harvesting in the harbour's north channel where 2 oyster
farms are located, Atlantic Shellfish and Oyster Farms Ltd, Cobh. The
oysters have not been linked to any outbreak here. Cork County
Council said yesterday it was reluctant to comment on reports of a
sewerage treatment plant being a possible source of pollution due to the
likelihood of legal proceedings. A senior official in the Department of
Marine, investigating the matter, was not available for comment. [But
valuable markets, built up over 30 years, are lost to the company due to
the harvesting restriction and the adverse publicity.
Food Safety Authority of Ireland director Alan Reilly said the FSAI
was advised last month by its Hong Kong counterpart of the virus
which was traced to exported shellfish from Cork Harbour. "By law,
the onus is on the supplier or producer to provide clean food," he said.
The 2 oyster farms in the channel produce, on average, about 450
tonnes of oysters. "There were times when Atlantic Shellfish produced
one-quarter of the country's total output." Complaints of a water
quality problem in the north channel go back several years to the
development of a new public sewerage treatment amenity in the
immediate area.

[Norwalk-like viruses are typically associated with outbreaks of
self-limited gastroenteritis with symptoms that may include nausea,
diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, fever, and malaise. Outbreaks
are characteristically associated with contaminated water supplies and
food-borne outbreaks are frequent. Contaminated shellfish are major
causes of epidemic gastroenteritis, with bivalve molluscs (oyster,
mussels, and cockles) being the most common source. These animals
are filter-feeders and can become infected where there is discharge of
raw sewage. This is the likely source of the virus in the present
instance, rather than the outbreaks of "winter-vomiting" illness
common in northern Europe at this time of year, which appear to be
maintained by person-to-person transmission. Readers are referred to
previous posts on ProMED-mail for further discussion of this topic.
