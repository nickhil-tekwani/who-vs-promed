More than 5000 livestock have been killed by heavy rains in Mandera, but Garissa executive Issa Yarrow says they are prepared for a downpour.

It has not started raining heavily in Garissa county. On Wednesday [16 Oct 2019], Agriculture executive Issa Yarrow said the livestock department was fully prepared to handle any eventualities when the heavy rains start.

Heavy rains are predicted in parts of Northeastern, a situation already being witnessed in Wajir and Mandera where downpours have wreaked havoc.

In a report dated 12 Oct 2019 and seen by the Star, Mandera's chief officer for livestock Shamsi Mohamud said the rains have killed more than 5000 animals.

On Wednesday [16 Oct 2019], Yarrow said veterinary officers had already been dispatched to vaccinate animals against Rift Valley fever and contagious caprine pleuropneumonia, which are common during the rainy season.

The aim is to vaccinate one million livestock.

"We don't want to wait until the last minute, then we start doing things in a hurry. Our teams are already on the ground attending to the animals," Yarrow said during an interview in his office. He said they were encouraging herders to move their animals to higher ground to prevent losses caused by flash floods.

Speaking in Garissa town last week, Governor Ali Korane urged veterinary officers to "do everything possible to make sure farmers don't lose their animals when it rains as has been the case over the years."

Korane asked farmers to ensure their animals were vaccinated, saying it was the only way to prevent losses.

On Monday (14 Oct 2019], Korane received a vehicle and laptops from the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization.

The new Toyota Hilux e and computers will be used by the department of Livestock and Animal Health for disease surveillance and control. It was handed over by FAO's country representative Robert Allport.

He said the county was committed to managing outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, peste des petits ruminants, Rift Valley fever, and anthrax.

Other counties that received the vehicles include Tana River, Kitui and Marsabit.

[In June-July 2018, a major epidemic of the zoonotic Rift Valley fever (RVF) hit Kenya, affecting both humans and animals; 10 outbreaks in animals were officially reported. These outbreaks were located in the counties of Wajir, Tana River, Isiolo, Siaya, Baringo, Marsabit, Mandera, and Meru. The event was reported as resolved on 30 Jul 2018. See event summary and updated OIE map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=26827.

According to Kenya's annual OIE report, during 2018, 4 603 301 cattle vaccinations were applied countrywide (Kenya's total cattle population in 2018 was reported as 17 872 779). No vaccinations were applied in Kenya's other RVF-susceptible animal species, namely 9 861 681 goats, 17 277 680 sheep and 2 986 057 camels. A certain part of the animal population composed of the 4 susceptible animal species in the said counties may have undergone infection during the event, and subsequently may have retained at least partial immunity against RVF, even if not vaccinated. Since Garissa was considered at high risk, it may be assumed that a part of the vaccination effort involved cattle in this county. However, not reported as included among the infected counties, a considerable percentage of Garissa's cattle, and all sheep, goats, and camels (about 300 000 of them kept in Garissa), may have remained susceptible.

Notably, the last published RVF outbreak in Garissa dates back to 2006.

Sheep are considered the species most susceptible to RVF.

RVF recently emerged in northeastern Sudan, affecting humans and livestock. - Mod.AS
