According to the Sunday Times [London] of 1 June 1997, a paper submitted to
Veterinary Record [the journal of the British Veterinary Association]
asserts:
"An international team of scientists who were given access to Britain`s
official records of cattle exports from 1985 to 1989 have concluded that
almost every country in the European Union has failed to report large numbers
of infected animals imported into their herds."
"Portugal has reported 96 cases of BSE, only six of which are attributed to
imported cattle. The scientists, however, estimate that the real figure of
BSE in cattle imported into Portugal could be more than 250.
Germany has reported only five cases of BSE in its entire herd, all of which
are cattle imported from Britain. However, the study found that Germany
could have imported more than 200 animals infected with BSE.
Ireland has reported 218 cases of BSE, 12 of which are imported animals. The
study suggests, however, that the Irish should have had about 1,000 cases in
imported animals alone.
Spain has so far failed to notify the international authorities of any cases
of BSE, yet the investigation suggests that more than 50 infected cattle were
exported from Britain in the late 1980s.
Italy has admitted two cases of BSE, both imported animals, but the study
suggests this could be as high as 50.
France admitted it has had 28 cases of BSE, all in home-bred animals. The
study found that it should have had more than 30 cases in imported animals
alone.
Belgium has failed to report any cases, but it should have had more than a
dozen.
Holland has admitted two cases this year, but it could have had more than 40
that have not been identified.
Denmark has reported one case, but it could have had 30 or more in imported
livestock."

[The obvious is now more likely. Also, there is no bluetongue in countries
that do not look for it. Nonetheless, these are estimates, not data. The
words "could" and "should" are used quite loosely here. -- Mod CHC]
