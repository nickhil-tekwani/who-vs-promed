News of an epidemic of Hansen's Disease in Bougainville doesn't surprise me
at all. Having documented an epidemic on Kapingamarangi and Pohnpei in
1982 (backwards and forwards), and having puzzled over the form of the
nearly identical curves of infection in both the Kapinga and Nauru and how
different they were from the Pingelapese curve, it is not so surprising
that endemic infection could become epidemic infection. The curves of
infection in Nauru and in the two Kapingamarangi communities showed a
PATTERN that is typical of curves of addictive use of drugs. One or two
index cases are quickly followed by a few more infections (~ the
introduction phase of drug use) followed by no new cases for a couple
years, followed by a few more cases and a long lag period of no new cases
(~ the habituation phase of addiction) followed by a sharp rise in cases,
the epidemic phase (~ the addictive phase).
The similarities between the two curves results from their representing the
same process, one of adaptation of a biological system to a new (component
of) environment. In the epidemic case, it is _Mycobacterium leprae_
adapting to its host environment. The 12 years between the first index
case and the beginning of the epidemic does not even equal one human
generation, so we can discount human adaptation. But even with the
bacteria's relatively slow reproductive rate, there are still about 500 +
generations in those 12 years. This is plenty of time for the bacteria,
which was barely holding its own in an obviously less than hospitable
environment, to adapt to its human hosts, say with a small change to one of
its surface protein markers that would mimic the host's own surface
proteins, allowing the bacteria to escape detection by the host's
phagocytes. What makes this hypothesis plausible is that both experiment
and observation (e.g., the work by Skinses after WWII) rule out somatic
adaptation or control of susceptibility. Susceptibility to leprosy is
genetically controlled. My own data confirm Skinses's findings.
If this common process of adaptation has occurred in Bougainville
populations, the resulting epidemic is hardly surprising. The kinds of
research that would confirm or falsify (a) whether it is an epidemic or (b)
whether these are just endemic cases finally getting diagnosed are
precisely an anthropologist's meat.
I can supply materials for documenting a leprosy epidemic, determining the
incubation period, identifying and working from first notice of symptoms
(as opposed to first diagnosis, which may occur years after the appearance
of symptoms), identifying the most likely places where infection occurred,
identifying possible sources of infection, etc. If anyone plans to do the
work, just ask and I'll send what I have.

Bougainville? It will require people on the scene to answer this. - Mod.CHC
