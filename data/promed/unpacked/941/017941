Foot-and-mouth scare proved to be a false alarm
-----------------------------------------------
A Foot and mouth scare at the weekend at Ballon Meats is almost certainly a
false alarm according to indications from the Department of Agriculture
last night.
Final test results expected this evening from the Institute of Animal
Health at Pirbright, Surrey, are believed to indicate that the factory and
farm at the centre of the controversy are free from infection.
The eyes of the Irish agriculture and food industry descended on Ballon at
the weekend following the discovery of suspicious ulcers on the mouth and
feet of 12 pigs presented for slaughter.
As a precautionary measure restrictions were immediately placed on Ballon
Meats and the animals at the factory killed, while the farming industry
waited anxiously for the preliminary results.
Restrictions were also placed on the farm of origin believed to be in the
Tullow area.
As the county remained poised on the brink of a potentially disastrous
outbreak, events such as the annual Ballon Point to Point races were cancelled.
Throughout the weekend Carlow Gardaï¿½nd department officials abided by the
strict enforcements now in place following the foot-and-mouth scare of 2001.
The Ballon scare significantly affected production at the meat plant, which
is run by the Salter family and employs approximately 70 people.

Huge relief as disease tests are negative
-----------------------------------------
Rural SDLP councillor Thomas Conway welcomed the results of recent tests on
pigs for foot-and-mouth disease that proved negative.
He said: "There is a sense of relief throughout the country and in
particular amongst the agricultural community that the Carlow Foot and
Mouth tests have proved negative.
"I want to compliment the vets involved for leaving nothing to chance.
"It is very reassuring that such a level of ongoing vigilance is in place
for the good of the economy throughout the 32 counties."
