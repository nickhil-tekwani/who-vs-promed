With reports of an outbreak of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever
(CCHF) in Gujarat among humans [See ProMED-mail archived report
below], the Nagaland Department of Veterinary and Animal Husbandry has
sounded a red alert to all veterinary units of the state.

According to official sources here today [14 May 2011], the
department, in a notification, has informed all the District
Veterinary Officers, Veterinary Assistant Supervisors and the RD
blocks and Veterinary dispensaries to take preventive measures.

According to a WHO report, CCHF is a viral haemorrhagic fever caused
by a virus classified in the genus _Nairovirus_. Following infection
via a tick bite, the incubation period is usually one to 3 days, with
a maximum of 9 days. The disease is endemic in many countries in
Africa, Europe and Asia, and during 2001, cases or outbreaks have been
recorded in Kosovo, Albania, Iran, Pakistan and South Africa.
