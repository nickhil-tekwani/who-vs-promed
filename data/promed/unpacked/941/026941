A woman from the central Anatolian province of Cankiri who contracted
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) died in a hospital in Ankara
on Thursday [10 Jul 2008]. The woman from Cankiri's Orta district,
was bitten by a tick and hospitalized at Cankiri State Hospital. As
her condition worsened, she was transferred to Ankara Numune Hospital
last Sunday [6 Jul 2008]. Doctors diagnosed her symptoms to have been
caused by a fatal viral disease [CCHF] carried by a species of tick.
She was subsequently moved to Diskapi Research Hospital for
treatment, where she died despite medical efforts to save her. She
was buried in her hometown of Kalfat in Orta.

[The CCHF death toll in Turkey was reported to be 37 on Mon 7 Jul
2008. The death of this woman presumably raises the death toll to 38.
