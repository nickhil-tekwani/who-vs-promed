China (Hong Kong): Fatal Case of Japanese Encephalitis
---------------------------------------------------
There has been wide media coverage on Thu 10 Jun 2004 in Hong Kong
regarding a fatal case of viral encephalitis in an Indonesian maid
caused by Japanese encephalitis virus. Investigations are ongoing.
So far the government has not posted a report on its website [as of 21:00
EST - Mod.JW]:

[Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is widespread throughout Asia. It is the
most important cause of arthropod-transmitted viral encephalitis. As detailed
below, it is transmitted to humans by culicine mosquitoes, and pigs often
feature as an amplifying host. The incubation period is 5-14 days, and onset
of symptoms is usually sudden. In the absence of CNS involvement, illness
usually resolves in 5-7 days. When there is CNS involvement, neurological
sequelae are common, although mortality is usually lower than 10 percent,
except in children, in whom it can reach 30 percent. Several effective
vaccines are available and have been used widely in mainland China. In 2002
local transmission of JEV was reported in Hong Kong, although in the present
case the identification of the victim as Indonesian may indicate that the
authorities believe the disease was imported. Further information is
awaited. - Mod.CP]
[The most important vector of Japanese encephalitis virus is _Culex
tritaeniorhynchus_, a species that breeds in rice fields and is found in most
parts of Asia, including Hong Kong. Other Asian vectors include _Culex
gelidus_ and _Culex vishnui_, both of which are present in Hong Kong. It
would seem likely that one [or more - Mod.JW] of these species would be
responsible for any transmission of Japanese encephalitis virus in Hong
Kong. - Mod.MS]
