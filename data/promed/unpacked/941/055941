Mosquito warning
----------------
The Health Department is warning visitors to WA's [Western
Australia's] winter holiday hotspots to take extra care following the
2nd case of the potentially-fatal Murray Valley encephalitis this
year [2009]. A Port Hedland man is in serious condition in Sir
Charles Gairdner Hospital after contracting the mosquito-borne virus.
A Broome child was infected in March [2009] and is still in Princess
Margaret Hospital in a stable condition.

Acting medical entomologist Susan Harrington said the department's
surveillance program continued to detect the rare virus as far south
as Carnarvon. "Despite the relative lack of rainfall in northern
regions over the past month, there are still mosquitoes around and it
is important that people living or travelling in the north take
particular care to avoid mosquito bites for the next few weeks," she said.

Early symptoms included fever, drowsiness, headaches, a stiff neck,
nausea, and dizziness. Anyone suffering from any of those should seek
medical advice immediately, Ms Harrington said. In severe cases,
sufferers experienced fits, lapsed into a coma, and could be left
with permanent brain damage or die. There is no specific cure.

Babies, young children, tourists, or newcomers to the north were most
likely to contract the virus. Avoiding going outdoors after dusk,
wearing long clothing, wearing suitable insect repellent, and
ensuring insect screens and nets were completely mosquito-proof were
all useful preventative measures.

The milder, but related, Kunjin virus was still being detected in the
north, while there had been more than 130 cases of Ross River and
Barmah Forest viruses in the past 3 months, Ms Harrington said.

Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) is endemic in northern
Australia (Western Australia and the top end of the Northern
Territories). In nature MVEV is amplified in bird-mosquito-bird
cycles and humans become infected if bitten by infected mosquitoes.
MVEV activity increases after heavy rainfall and flooding. In
northern Australia sporadic cases or small outbreaks of MVE occur
every few years, usually during the wet season. Serological studies
show that only 1 in 800-1000 people infected developed clinical
disease. Of those that did, 25 percent have died and a further 25-50
percent have been left with permanent neurological damage. The
primary hosts of MVEV are water birds. Ardeiformes (herons),
particularly the Rufous Night-heron, and the Pelicaniformes
(cormorants/darters) are the most commonly infected. The primary
mosquito vector during epidemics is _Culex annulirostris_. Other
mosquitoes such as _Cx. australicus_ and some _Ochlerotatus_ species
may be involved in other aspects of MVEV ecology.
