A local unit of Italian dairy group Parmalat said on Fri, 9 Mar 2007,
it had recalled a batch of pasteurized milk that has been linked to
more than 300 cases of food poisoning in Paraguay. Hospitals in the
Alto Parana region of the South American nation have been inundated
with patients suffering food poisoning in the last 2 days.
Company representatives said the poisoning seemed to be caused by
refrigeration problems unrelated to milk production. "The products
were recalled from the Paraguayan market and now they're being
analyzed, but at the moment the information indicates that the milk's
decomposition took place in the refrigeration chain," Jose Maria
Aguero, a representative of Parmalat Paraguay, told local radio.
A trade group representing supermarkets said the suspect batch of
milk had been taken off shelves due to a request by the Health
Ministry's National Food and Nutrition Institute.
A senior health official in Alto Parana, Francisco Guerrero, said
patients had reported symptoms that include vomiting and diarrhea
several hours after drinking milk.
"We appeal to people that, for the moment, they don't drink Parmalat
milk and that shopkeepers take back their stock to where they bought
it. That way the risk of more people falling ill is reduced," he said.

[The etiology of this illness, apparently associated with poorly
refrigerated pasteurized milk, is not stated. Given the short
incubation period observed, staphylococcal enterotoxin-induced
illness should be considered. ProMED awaits more information
regarding this outbreak.
Alto Parana is located in the southeastern part of this country and
