Scientists said that they have found which species of mosquito in
northern Greece is spreading the West Nile [WN] virus, which claimed
an 8th life yesterday [20 Aug 2010].

Experts at Aristotle University in Thessaloniki have been studying
mosquito samples for the last few days and found that the species that
is transmitting the virus is _Culex pipiens_ of the _Culex_ genus.
_Culex_ mosquitoes are known to carry a number of other diseases
[pathogens]. They are often found in cities and feed off birds, which
are the main carriers of the West Nile virus.

The [Greek] Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) said
that an 8th person has died after contracting the disease but did not
release further details. The number of people who have [been infected
by] the West Nile virus rose to 92 after another 15 were diagnosed
with the illness yesterday [20 Aug 2010]. However, 44 of these are no
longer receiving hospital treatment.

[ProMED-mail thanks Ronan Kelly for bringing this report to out
attention. The report answers the question raised in the 20 Aug 2010
moderator comment (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100821.2922) about
which mosquito vectors of WN virus have been involved in this
outbreak. Evidently, the Asian tiger mosquito (_Aedes albopictus_),
mentioned in the previous report, has not been implicated in WN virus
transmission in this outbreak. As indicated above, _Culex pipiens_
(see photo at <http://aramel.free.fr/Culex-pipiens-f.jpg>) has been
identified as the vector.
