The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Select Food Products
Limited are warning the public not to consume certain canned products
described below because the products may be contaminated with
_Clostridium botulinum_. Toxins produced by this bacterium may cause
botulism, a life-threatening illness.
The following canned products are affected by this alert:
Brand/ Product/ Size /UPC /Lot Codes (on lid)
---------------------------------------------
Select / Beef Gravy /100 fl oz (2.84 L)/ UPC-0 6360000815/Lot codes -
Up to and including 2336
Fast Eddie's/ Crazy Chili Sauce / 6 lb 4 oz (2.83 Kg)/ UPC- 0
6360001698/Lot codes - up to and including 1786
These products are known to have been distributed in Ontario and may
have been distributed elsewhere in Canada. These products were mainly
distributed to food service establishments but may also been sold
from retail or wholesale outlets.
There have been no reported illnesses associated with the consumption
of these products.
Food contaminated with the _Clostridium botulinum_ bacterium or its
toxin may not look or smell spoiled. Consumption of food contaminated
with the toxin may cause nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness,
headache, double vision, dry throat, respiratory failure and
paralysis. In severe cases of illness, people may die.
The manufacturer, Select Food Products Limited, Toronto, Ontario is
voluntarily recalling the affected products from the marketplace. The
CFIA is monitoring the effectiveness of the recall.

[Given the large size of the packaging, the contaminated products are
indeed likely to have wound up in wholesale establishments but retail
chains such as BJ's or Costco (from personal experience) carry large
sizes as well.
ProMED-mail does not post most food recalls unless human cases
result. Botulism recalls are generally posted, however, because of
the potential severity of illness. - Mod.LL]
