Experts advise vigilance against ticks
--------------------------------------
[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) made its appearance in Turkey in
the country in 2002.] Since then, there have been 2315 cases of this
potentially fatal virus in 100 villages throughout Turkey, with 140 people
dying as a result. [The table in the footnote at the source URL shows a
somewhat higher figure. - Mod.CP]

The Ministry of Health has produced a map showing regions where people are
at risk of contracting CCHF, with the majority of the areas being in the
Central Anatolian and central Black Sea regions. The focus at this point in
terms of risk appears to be on the regions around Gumushane, Tokat, Sivas,
Amasya, Corum, Yozgat, Kastamonu, Karabuk and Cankiri.

Tick bites tend to be more prevalent when the weather starts to warm up,
but this year [2009] the 1st tick bites seen by health professionals came
earlier than expected. Experts say that with warmer weather staring earlier
than usual, ticks have laid eggs and these eggs have then hatched in
advance of their normal time, meaning that people are coming in close
contact with ticks earlier than in previous years.

Experts also note that ticks remain active essentially until the weather
outside becomes too cold for them and that people will thus have to remain
vigilant until November and all through the summer months. Experts also
warn people to check their bodies carefully after spending time outdoors,
especially in open fields or forest lands.

Dr Orhan Yildiz of Erciyes University's medical faculty noted that a fully
grown tick produces around 6000 baby ticks yearly and that there is no way
to prevent this from happening. Yildiz noted that as the number of ticks
rises, so does the number of cases of people being bitten and getting ill
from the tick bites. He points to the early rise in temperatures in some
parts of Turkey as having led to early tick egg hatchings.

Yildiz also pointed to general climate change in the world, the limitations
placed on rabbit hunting and the wholesale destruction of many chickens in
Turkey around the time of the bird flu scare as all being factors that have
led to a steep rise in the number of ticks in the nation. He says that more
difficult days in fighting these ticks face Turkey in the future.

Dr Zati Vatansever of Kars Kafkas University's veterinary faculty noted
that early detection of a tick on the body can play a large role in
preventing serious illness and even death. Dr Vatansever noted that many
people returning from working or relaxing outdoors are not even aware that
they have been bitten by a tick, and he warned: "When people who have been
outside in a field or on a picnic return home, they should check themselves
carefully. Ticks suck blood from cows. So, if we give certain anti-tick
medicine to the cows, we should be able to reduce the numbers of these
ticks somewhat. There is no other method that we know of. There is some
talk of other ways that could be used to fight ticks, but it's nothing but
sensationalism." Vatansever also noted that while there are 900 different
kinds of ticks that have been scientifically identified, there are around
30 different kinds in Turkey, and that one of these carries the virus.

Incorrect information about ticks
---------------------------------
Vatansever noted that there is a lot of incorrect information about ticks
circulating among people these days. Noting that tick-transmitted viral
diseases have been around for a long time, Vatansever said: "This
particular virus has existed for a long time, but we didn't know about it.
We didn't notice it because there were so few cases. Then we really became
aware because the number of cases shot up. There is a considerable level of
ecological regeneration going on in Turkey -- from forestry projects to an
increase in the number of wild animals. In addition to all this, there is
the ongoing migratory trend from villages to cities and towns. The fact
that fields are not being fully used and worked has created an ideal
environment for wild animals and the ticks that feed off of them. If we
look at the ecological regeneration going on since the 1990s, it is much
easier for us to understand so much here."

Vatansever also noted that how a person removes a tick from his or her body
is not the important thing, but that the real question in terms of the
disease entering the body is how long the tick has been feeding off the
blood of that person. He said: "If you are able to remove the tick within
the 1st 6 to 12 hours, then the risk of contracting a disease is at its
lowest. But the longer the tick is attached to your body, the more time
there is for the virus to be transmitted into the bloodstream, and thus the
risk rises."
