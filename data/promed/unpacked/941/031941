At this time, a Buenos Aires laboratory is analyzing blood samples of a policeman who was serving in the Paimun rural area, to determine if his death that occurred this past Wednesday [16 Jan 2013] was due to [a] hantavirus [infection]. The lance corporal suffered non-traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest with septic shock according to his death certificate, probably caused by the virus [that is] dispersed by long-tailed rodents, considering the symptoms when he was admitted to hospital of this city [Junin de los Andes] on Tuesday [15 Jan 2013].

The policeman was working in the La Union group, in the detachment located where Lakes Paimun and Huechulafquen join, a rural area populated by Mapuche [indigenous] communities much visited by tourists in summer, some 50 km distance from this city [Junin de los Andes] on route 61. This area is having a blooming of some patches of colihue cane, the seeds of which are the preferred food of rodents that carry the virus. [This cane, _ Chusquea culeou_, is a bamboo of temperate regions in Argentina and Chile. - Mod.TY]

According to various versions, the man began to feel ill at the end of last week, and on Tuesday was admitted to the local hospital with signs typically caused by the hantavirus [infection]. However, the hospital indicated that the symptoms as such are not sufficient to state that it is that disease [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome]. "Samples have been sent to a laboratory in Buenos Aires for testing and soon in a few days we will have the results with an epidemiological report to determine reliably the cause of death," according to the [hospital] sources who were consulted.

The typical symptoms of hantavirus infection are: chills and fever, headache, diarrhea, muscle pain and, during the course of the disease, respiratory insufficiency that causes cardiac arrest.

People who experience these symptoms should go immediately to the nearest hospital.

[Although the hantavirus involved in this likely case is not specified, given the locale along the western mountainous border of Argentina it most likely is Andes virus. Human infections by Andes virus are relatively frequent in the southern part of the Andes mountains, especially in Chile.
