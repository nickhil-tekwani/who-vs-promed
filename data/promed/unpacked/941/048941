Viral etiology of ovine pulmonary carcinoma
-------------------------------------------
Researchers have discovered a virus that causes a contagious lung cancer in
sheep, according to a paper published on Tue 10 Apr 2001 in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences [see Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol.
98, Issue 8, 4449-4454, April 10, 2001. - Mod.CP]
The cancer in sheep is similar to [human] bronchioalveolar carcinoma, which
accounts for 25 percent of all human lung cancers and is one of the few
lung cancers not associated with smoking. The scientists have not made a
similar link between viruses and lung cancer in humans, said Dr. Hung Fan,
Director of the Cancer Research Institute at the University of California,
Irvine. Fan said he hopes their work will shed light on what causes
bronchioalveolar carcinoma and lead to more effective drugs.

[This report is a rather inaccurate citation of the paper by Maeda et al.
(Institute and Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University
of California, Irvine) appearing in the current issue of PNAS (see
<http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/98/8/4449>).
This group has shown previously that Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) is
the causative agent of ovine pulmonary carcinoma, and that this condition
provides a unique animal model for human bronchioalveolar carcinoma.
Isolation of a JSRV proviral clone which was both infectious and oncogenic
established that JSRV was necessary and sufficient for the development of
ovine pulmonary carcinoma. However, the mechanism of transformation was
unknown because the JSRV genome did not appear to include a recognized
viral oncogene. The Maeda et al. paper concerns experiments involving
testing the transforming potential of components of the JSRV genome by
transfecting an expression plasmid for JSRV [pCMVJS21, driven by the
cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter] into mouse NIH 3T3 cells.
Foci of transformed cells appeared in the transfected cultures 2-3 weeks
post-transfection; cloned transformants showed anchorage independence for
growth, and they expressed JSRV RNA. These results indicated that the JRSV
genome contains information with direct transforming potential for NIH 3T3
cells. Remarkably, a derivative of pCMVJS21 (pCMVJS21GP) in which the gag,
pol, and orf-x coding sequences were deleted produced transformed foci.
These results indicate that the envelope gene alone carries the
transforming potential. This is an unusual example of a native retroviral
structural protein with transformation potential.
JSRV belongs to the genus _Betaretrovirus_, which also includes Mouse
mammary tumor virus. - Mod.CP]
