RIO DE JANEIRO: Brazilian agricultural authorities are investigating a
tetanus outbreak that has killed more than 300 head of cattle over the last
month in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. "The investigation is being
conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture, which has not yet verified
whether or not the disease was transmitted by a vermicide," said a
spokesperson for the Rio Grande do Sul Agriculture Secretariat.
Preliminary exams reportedly indicate the outbreak was caused by a
vermicide used to kill intestinal worms. Agriculture officials said they
expect to announce an answer sometime this week.
On 12 Jun 2001, veterinarians from 3 separate universities confirmed the
presence of tetanus in the first reported case at the Nossa Senhora do
Rosario ranch in Brazil's southernmost state.
Federal agricultural authorities stepped in after confirming cattle in at
least 3 municipalities have died of tetanus.

Vermicide is the probable cause of tetanus in Gaucho [Rio Grande do Sul]
animals. The first results of tests on material collected from cattle and
sheep that died of tetanus during the last 3 weeks in the municipalities of
Sao Gabriel, Rosario do Sul and Heral, led [investigators to suspect] a
brand of vermicide. More than 300 animals died.
The official results will be released in the next few days by the Regional
Area Animal Laboratory (LARA) of the Ministry of Agriculture. The
bacteriologist Joaquim Fernandes of the Federal University of Rio Grande do
Sul said that the anti-tetanus serum [would resolve] the problem if given
early on, during the first symptoms of the disease.

The Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) should announce the
results of the pathology exams to identify the causes of tetanus which
affected 255 cattle on 3 properties [ranches] since 11 Jun 2001.
The Federal University of Pelotas (UFPel) will make public the [results of
tests] conducted on 55 sheep that died from the same disease in the
municipality of Pedras Altas.
If the cause is definitely a vermicide, the state government will solicit
the Ministry of Agriculture to remove the product from the market.

An outbreak of tetanus has already caused the death of more than 300 cattle
and sheep in 3 municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul. The deaths from this
disease, identified on 12 Jun 2001, have not yet been published in the
worldwide veterinary literature.
To identify the causes of the disease, occurring in 4 properties of Rosario
do Sul, Sao Gabriel and Herval, 3 federal universities in Rio Grande do Sul
were mobilized.
The first cases were registered in the Nossa Senhora do Rosario ranch, in
Sao Gabriel, where, 3 weeks ago, the owners of the farm were surprised by
the death of 3 or 4 calves per day and called the veterinarians of the
Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), [who were] in charge of
the necropsy and of the identification of the cause of death. During the
early investigation, 2 hypotheses were proposed: tetanus or strychnine
poisoning.
The latter [strychnine poisoning] was discarded after the veterinarians
inoculated mice with material from the wounds of the dead animals. The
presence of the agent of tetanus [_Clostridium tetani_] was confirmed. The
[task now remaining] is to discover the cause. [In the days following the
outbreak in Sao Gabriel], animals from 2 farms in Rosario do Sul (Paraiso
and Santa Regina) also began to die of the same causes. The Federal
University of Pelotas (UFPel) also identified the slaughter in sheep in the
municipality of Herval.

[This is most unusual. None of these articles explains how the vermicide is
administered. However, for a vermicide to be the source, and for this many
animals to be dead from tetanus, is very unusual.
Tetanus is caused by a specific neurotoxin produced by _Clostridium tetani_
in necrotic tissue. _C. tetani_ is an anaerobe with terminal, spherical
spores, and is found in soil and intestinal tracts. In most cases, it is
introduced into the tissues through wounds, particularly deep puncture
wounds, which provide a stable anaerobic environment. In some species, such
as lambs, the disease follows docking or castration. Sometimes the point of
entry cannot be found because the wound may be minor or may have already
healed. - Mod.TG]
[If, indeed, this is tetanus and is associated with the use of a vermicide,
we would appreciate an explanation of the pathophysiology of such an
association. - Man. Ed. DS]
