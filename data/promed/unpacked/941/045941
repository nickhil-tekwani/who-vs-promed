----------------------------------------------------------------------
The idea that most cases of "acute encephalitis" in Uttar Pradesh are caused by diseases other than Japanese encephalitis is borne out by reporting statistics. In the following chart, note the precipitous decline in "Japanese encephalitis" incidence which followed introduction of reporting for "acute encephalitis" in 2008 (upper graph). This phenomenon is even more striking for India as a whole (lower graph).https://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/JE-India.png [1,2]

[Unfortunately, ProMED-mail is unable to duplicate the graphs in this post. ProMED readers are urged to see the graphs that can be accessed at the URL above. Dr Berger accurately describes them and the trends that they illustrate. The good news is that with increased vaccination, the numbers of Japanese (JE) cases have declined. The not so good news is that the numbers of undiagnosed acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases have increased.

AES continues to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and lychee fruit consumption. Recently, scrub typhus has been implicated in many AES cases. Clearly, prospective studies are needed to define the causes of AES. Until the etiologies are known, prevention and effective treatment will not be possible.

Dr Berger is thanked for sending this information.
