Polio case detected in Mumbai
-----------------------------
Just when the city thought it had eradicated polio, comes the news that an
infant from a slum in Dindoshi, Malad east, has tested positive for the
wild polio virus. "This detection means Mumbai, which was polio-free for 3
years, will have to face another rigorous anti-polio drive for the next 3
years," said an official. To get polio-free status, any area or country
should not have a case for 3 consecutive years.
The detection comes on the eve of the special pulse polio drive on Sunday.
About 11 lakh [1.1 million -- one lakh is 100 000 - Mod.MPP] children in
Mumbai will be given the oral polio vaccine as part of the fifth pulse
polio drive since October. Usually, Mumbai has 2 or 3 rounds of polio
drives [per year].

[According to the polio eradication website
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>, in 2004, as of the week of
30 Jun, 339 cases of poliomyelitis associated with wild virus infection
have been identified globally, 312 of which were reported from 6 endemic
countries: Nigeria (259 cases), Niger (18), Pakistan (17), India (14),
Afghanistan (3), and Egypt (1). As the article above mentions, interruption
of wild virus transmission is defined as the absence of cases of polio
associated with wild poliovirus for 3 consecutive years. While India as a
country has not yet interrupted transmission, the number of annual reported
cases has fallen significantly, and there are states within the country
that have interrupted transmission with no wild poliovirus identified for 3
or more years.
Annual reported case counts for India are shown below, with this year to
date appearing to have a major reduction in reported cases from prior years
<http://www.who.int/vaccines/casecount/afpextractnew.cfm>.
Year / no. confirmed cases polio
1996 / 1005
1997 / 2275
1998 / 4322
1999 / 2817
2000 / 265
2001 / 268
2002 / 1600
2003 / 225
2004 / 14 (as of week of 30 Jun 2004)
Within India, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are endemic states where poliovirus
transmission has not been interrupted. In addition, an outbreak of polio in
Karnataka that began in mid-2003 has led to cases in Karnataka in 2004 and
additional cases in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu (National Polio
Surveillance Project <http://www.npspindia.org/>).
Mumbai is located in Maharastra state, which borders with Karnataka and
Andhra Pradesh. It is a disappointing setback to have re-seeding of
geographic areas that had previously interrupted wild poliovirus
circulation. - Mod.MPP]
