A cluster of 15 _E. coli_ infection cases in June 2018, all among children, came from 2 different sources, Knox County Health Department investigators have concluded: a somewhat unusual outcome.

The health department announced Fri 6 Jul 2018 that 2 different strains of _E. coli_ O157 sickened the children, 9 of whom were hospitalized and 7 of whom developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a severe complication that affects the kidneys and occurs in 5-10 percent of infected people. One child remains hospitalized, now in fair condition, at East Tennessee Children's Hospital. The outbreak appears to be over, as no new transmissions are occurring, health officials said.

"While it is rare, it appears we had 2 sets of children sickened by 2 different strains of _E. coli_ O157 at the same time," said health department director Dr. Martha Buchanan. "The epidemiological evidence overwhelmingly supported the 2-source theory: consumption of raw milk and some type of contact, most likely indirect, with ruminant animals. The investigation revealed no definitive connections between the 2 sources or the 2 groups of ill children. And this is now supported by the state's lab results confirming it was 2 different strains of _E. coli_ O157."

Ten of the 15 ill children had a common link: they consumed raw milk from French Broad Farm in East Knox county. State lab results confirmed these children had the same strain of _E. coli_ O157 and that this strain is a DNA fingerprint match to the _E. coli_ O157 found in cow manure samples collected from French Broad Farm.

Though the lab did not find _E. coli_ O157 in the raw milk samples, that is not uncommon and doesn't mean the milk the children drank was not contaminated, Buchanan said. _E. coli_ bacteria do not distribute themselves uniformly in milk, meaning a portion of even the same glass of milk can be contaminated while another portion is not. That's why raw milk's safety can't be guaranteed, even if a dairy takes precautions, including testing the milk. Based on the dates when the children started showing symptoms of infection, and allowing time for the milk to be distributed and time for incubation of the illness, officials believe the contamination event occurred in mid-May 2018.

The other 5 ill children had only one common link: attending the same child-care facility, Kids Place Inc. in Mascot, [TN], where goats are present. State lab results confirmed these 5 children had the same strain of _E. coli_ O157 and that it was a DNA match to the _E. coli_ O157 found in goat fecal samples and one hay sample collected from the child-care center. The lab did not find _E. coli_ O157 in other environmental samples from inside the facility.

_E. coli_ O157 is naturally found in the intestinal tracts of certain types of farm animals, including healthy cattle, sheep, and goats, which can then shed it in their stool without appearing unhealthy. _E. coli_ can contaminate the animals' skin, fur, and the areas where they live and roam.
