African horse sickness takes its toll in Makana District
--------------------------------------------------------
Grahamstown: African horse sickness has broken out in the Makana district
and there are fears that wild zebra in surrounding game farms will harbor
the virus over winter.
The outbreak was confirmed by Grahamstown state veterinarian Dr Jane
Pistorius, who said 15 horses had died in the Grahamstown, Highlands,
Alicedale, Carlisle Bridge, and the Alicedale areas. She said: "Horse
sickness is extremely serious and has potentially very serious consequence
for the horse export market in Cape Town should it spread any further. So
far it is fairly under control in the Eastern Cape and large areas in
around and the Boland and the Cape." She said there were 12 outbreaks in
the Makana area -- the first outbreak in more than 20 years in the area.
"Last year more than 100 horses died in the East London/Butterworth area
and we suspect it might be same strain that is killing the horses here."
She believed the midges carrying the virus flourished because of unusually
wet conditions. It was "essential" for people to report any sickness they
notice in horses and to get them vaccinated. "We recommend the use of the
second vaccine first because this is a very serious kind of horse
sickness." She said horse sickness posed no danger to humans.
Dr Annina Delport of Delport WH veterinary practice said they picked up
cases a month ago. Once the horse is infected, its condition "deteriorates
very rapidly". The midges [are found mainly in low-lying dams; she
recommends that horses be set to graze in higher grazing land.
Another Grahamstown vet, Dr Buzz Bowker, said his practice was aware of at
least 30 cases of horse sickness, 20 of which had died. He agreed that the
first cases had come to his attention about a month ago. Currently 5 cases
were being treated. He said the outbreak of the "dikkop" form of African
Horse sickness [the cardiac, subacute form of the disease - Mod.AS in the
Makana district followed last year's outbreak in areas of the former
Transkei and East London areas. "African Horse sickness is a viral disease
caused by an Orbivirus that is carried by midges of the Culicoides family."
He said horses affected included expensive and highly bred Warm bloods,
used for show jumping and dressage.
The disease started as a fever with swellings developing on the head
particularly, above the eyes. "These swellings often spread to the neck and
chest with death being caused by heart failure when the virus attacked the
heart muscles." Death may occur acutely within a few days or after a week
or 10 days, with at least 50 per cent of affected animals eventually
succumbing. He said: "A lot of the horses were pets and the impact on
owners has been very emotional." He urged horse owners to vaccinate, spray
their animals with insect repellent, keep them away from low-lying areas
and vleis [areas of low marshy ground, especially ones that feed streams. -
Mod.SH, especially where there was water, and to stable them at night. It
is thought at this stage that the strain involved in this outbreak is in
the second fraction of the 2-phase vaccine, and he suggested that the
second injection be given first. He cautioned that African horse sickness
could be around for some time as the virus could "overwinter" in the zebra
on the many surrounding game farms.
"The zebra can serve as an asymptomatic reservoir (the carrier is not
harmed) when the midges disappear after the first few frosts." He said they
had also had cases where vaccinated horses had contracted the disease.

[The recording of African horse sickness [AHS in the southwestern parts of
the Eastern Cape province is a cause for concern, due to the proximity to
the Western Cape Province -- the only province in South Africa that is
regarded as free from the disease.
The news item does not specify the AHS serotype involved, but indicates
that it "belongs to the second fraction of the 2-phase vaccine", suggesting
"that the second injection be given first". It seems thus that the current
outbreak might be involved with one (or more?) of the virus serotypes that
are included in "Bottle 2" of the Onderstepoort live attenuated AHS
vaccine. According to the OIE's Manual of Standards for Diagnostic Tests
and Vaccines 2000 <http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00032.htm>, 2
quadrivalent vaccines are constituted by mixing equal volumes of serotypes
1,3,4,5 and 2,6,7,8, respectively. They are given in 2 separate doses 21
days apart (and, according to the producers' directions, must not be given
in the same site, at the same time as any other vaccine). It seems, thus,
that the current outbreak might be related to one (or more) of the
serotypes in "bottle 2" -- namely 2,6,7,8. Additional information from our
South African colleagues will be very much appreciated. - Mod.AS
