Red tide kills thousands of fish off Yucatan
---------------------------
An outbreak of red tide off the coast of Mexico's Yucatan state has killed
thousands of fish, officials said Tuesday.
A harmful algal bloom, popularly known as red tide, is affecting beaches in
the Telchac region and officials are trying to determine the cause, Yucatan
Gov. Patricio Patron said. Some beaches in the southeastern Mexican state
may be closed off to bathers, the governor said.
Red tide is caused by a sudden increase, or bloom, in harmful algae
species, which produce potent neurotoxins that can be transferred through
the food chain, thereby killing large numbers of fish, according to
experts. Humans may become poisoned by ingesting contaminated seafood
products.
Contelsa de Telchac seafood company general manager Miguel Arroyo said red
tide would seriously affect the octopus fishing season, which began 1 Aug
2003. Fishing company owner Fernando Gamboa, meanwhile, said the red tide
outbreak could also negatively affect lobster season, which began a month ago.
Red tide may spread to the beaches of Progreso, one of the region's most
popular tourist destinations, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Telchac,
later this week, experts said.
2 years ago, an algal bloom affected the Yucatan region, causing serious
damage to the fishing and tourism industries.

[There are numerous algal organisms capable of producing the toxic
phenomenon known as red tide. The algae most often affect sea food that is
consumed by people and reported as Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning. Red tides
may produce skin and respiratory irritation in swimmers and beachgoers. ­
