An outbreak of an unknown disease that has affected 18 residents of Itapira (SP) [municipality, Sao Paulo state] has intrigued the city located in the region of Mogi Mirim [municipality]. The cases arose on [4 Oct 2014], when 12 people consulted 2 city hospitals reporting symptoms like swelling of the tongue, facial paralysis, tachycardia, sweating, muscle contractures and, in some cases, high blood pressure.

Without a definite diagnosis, the city's health department asked the Poisoning Control Center [PCC] of the State University of Campinas (Unicamp) to investigate the case and find the source of the problem. The patients were treated at local hospitals where they received a medication to treat symptoms and were released.

Only 2 victims were hospitalized for 2 days, but were well. The patients live in the Prados, Vila Boa Esperanaa, Jardim Magali, Dela Rocha, and the neighborhoods of Machadinho and Macucos in the rural part of the town. The issue became a central theme in many conversations in town and people want to know if there is risk for the population.

The epidemiological surveillance found no correlation between water or food ingested by the group. Having no idea of what illness affected 12 people in a single day, the matter was discussed with the PCC, which ruled out the hypothesis of poisoning by external factor. According to the report of the secretary of health, clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory evaluation of patients also ruled out an infectious disease. Health surveillance teams collected water samples at the residence of patients and forwarded them to the PCC.

Further samples of blood and urine of some patients were also collected for analyses. According to a spokesperson from Unicamp, the results of chromatography analysis of the water samples performed at the Institute of Chemistry should be available in a week.

The mystery of the outbreak is even greater because a preliminary analysis of water taken by Reference Laboratory for the Regional Health Department, revealed no abnormalities in the sample. As long as there is no diagnosis, the townspeople wonder about the outbreak. "We are worried because we do not know what it is and how it spreads," said Vera Silva, who works in the city center.

[Information about person-place-time is scarce. What is the age group affected? All the same sex? What is the spatial distribution of cases? What is the epidemiological link between them? Was there complete resolution of symptoms? How soon?

Although the news report mentions that "the hypothesis of poisoning by external factors" has been discarded, there is information that the results of chromatographic analysis of water samples are still awaited. Therefore, the hypothesis of poisoning should still be considered plausible.

Additional information on the results of the investigation would be welcome. - Mod.RNA
