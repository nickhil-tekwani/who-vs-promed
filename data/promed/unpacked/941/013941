A medical worker at a Shanghai hospital died from H7N9 bird flu infection, as the virus spreads further in China during the winter months.

The 31-year-old man died on 18 Jan 2014, according to a statement on the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning website today [20 Jan 2014]. The city has reported 7 cases of H7N9 infection this year [2014], the statement said.

Human cases of H7N9 were 1st reported in China in March [2013] and spiked in April [2013] before agriculture authorities temporarily closed live poultry markets to limit human exposure. The Geneva-based World Health Organization counted 139 laboratory-confirmed cases and 45 deaths as of 6 Nov 2014.

"It's always a concern when health workers die," said Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the World Health Organization in Geneva. "Hospitals and other medical facilities are a flash point for human-to-human transmission. We would be very much wanting to follow up in as much detail as possible on this case."

Even though H7N9 hasn't mutated to become as contagious as seasonal flu, strains that emerge in China are of special interest to researchers. The 1957-58 Asian flu and 1968-69 Hong Kong flu pandemics were 1st identified in the world's most populous nation. Another bird flu strain known as H5N1 is thought to have come from the southern province of Guangdong in 1996.

"We need more evidence before increasing our level of concern," said Ben Cowling, an associate professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong's school of public health, referring to the Shanghai medical worker's death. "We know that there is always potential risk for health-care workers treating cases of H7N9 to be infected, so it's not unexpected."

A 31-year-old emergency doctor who died of pneumonia and respiratory failure on Saturday [18 Jan 2014] morning is suspected of having had H7N9 bird flu virus. Samples have been sent for tests at the Shanghai Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

The doctor worked at the Pudong New Area People's Hospital. He was said to have had a fever for a week but continued working. His condition deteriorated on Friday [17 Jan 2014] after a shift, and he was admitted to intensive care and placed on a respirator. But the young doctor, whose wife is pregnant, died shortly after 4:20 AM on Saturday [18 Jan 2014].

Dr Lu Hongzhou, director of the city's expert group for H7N9 diagnosis and treatment, told the Shanghai Daily that he took part in a group diagnosis of the case on Friday [17 Jan 2014]. "I received a phone call for a group consultation during the afternoon. The patient's condition had developed very quickly, and I gave guidance on the treatment," Lu said. "Samples have been collected for laboratory testing. Only these results can tell what kind of virus it is," added Lu. "The symptoms of H1 and H7 flu are similar," he added. Lu said the doctor had no history of contact with live poultry.

The Shanghai Health and Family Planning Commission said that its website will immediately report any H7N9 case. The city has reported 5 H7N9 cases this month [January 2014], including 2 cases confirmed last week.

Last Wednesday, a 35-year-old man was reported as having contracted the H7N9 bug. He was diagnosed last Tuesday. A 54-year-old man, a native of Wuhu City in Anhui Province, was diagnosed with H7N9 last Wednesday, and the case was announced the following day. He is receiving treatment at a local hospital, said officials. The commission did not say whether he had been in contact with live poultry.

Shanghai's 1st H7N9 case this winter [2013-14] was reported on 4 Jan 2014, when an 86-year-old man who had bought live poultry in the market was confirmed to have the virus. In 2 other cases reported this month [January 2014], a 58-year-old woman was confirmed with the virus on 10 Jan 2014, and a 56-year-old man was diagnosed on 11 Jan 2014.

[This case, apart from its inherent interest, may shed light on the fatal case of avian H5N1 influenza virus infection recently confirmed in Alberta, Canada [see: Avian influenza, human (13): Canada ex China (BJ) H5N1, fatal, case report 20140112.2167282]. The fatal case was an Albertan medical employee of Asian origin who had recently visited Beijing and, although not known to have had contact with domestic fowl, may in the course of her stay have had contact with medical personnel or colleagues. Such an event might explain how she became infected with a Chinese strain of avian H5N1 influenza virus prior to her return to Alberta. However, avian influenza H5N1 virus may be more transmissible from person-to-person than H7N9 virus. - Mods.CP/LM
