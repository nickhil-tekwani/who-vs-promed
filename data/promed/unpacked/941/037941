Tragedy struck in Imo state on Monday [10 Jun 2019] after fumes from a generator left 10 guests who attended a traditional wedding dead.

Punch Metro learned that no fewer than 30 other guests were on life support in different hospitals in the Ikeduru and Mbaitoli local government areas [LGAs] of the state as a result of the fumes the guests inhaled from the generator.

Our correspondent learned that [F] and [I] had their traditional wedding at [U's] compound, Umuomumu Mbieri, in the Mbaitoli LGA of the state on Sunday [9 Jun 2019]. While the groom was said to hail from Anambra state, the bride and her family reside in Aba, Abia state.

A source in the community told our correspondent that while the couple left after the traditional rites, their relatives stayed back and slept in the family house.

The source said, "After the traditional wedding, the couple, [I] and [F], left while their relatives stayed back. The bride's parents, who are among the survivors, also slept in the house.

"It was in the morning that it dawned on everybody that something bad had happened. The 'I pass my neighbour' generator was kept in the kitchen, while the doors and windows were locked.

"People started knocking on the doors for them to come out but to no avail. The doors were forced open, and to the surprise of everybody, about 50 persons who had slept in the building were found unconscious; some were already dead. We quickly mobilised our people and rushed them to hospitals. The unconscious are on life support machines as we speak."

The village head, Martin Ezurike, told our correspondent that he had to release his car to convey the victims to hospitals. Describing, the incident as shocking to the community, Ezurike said it was clear the fumes from the generator, which was still working on Monday morning [10 Jun 2019] when the doors were forced open, killed the victims.

"I know it was not a case of food poisoning, but fumes from the generator that killed them; this is shocking. The parents of the [woman] who got married were among those who survived. Among the dead were the bride's twin siblings," the village head said.

The state commissioner of police, Rabiu Ladodo, who confirmed the incident to our correspondent in Owerri, said he had ordered a full-scale investigation of the incident.

Ladodo stated, "The generator was on in the kitchen till the dawn of the day, while the doors and windows of the rooms the guests slept in were locked. It is a case of sudden and unnatural death, but we have commenced an investigation into it. Assistance is being rendered to the survivors."

When our correspondent visited the Ikeduru Hospital, where about 20 survivors were rushed to for treatment, the doctors were seen battling to save them.

The administrator of the hospital, Dr Austin Agbahiwe, who spoke to our correspondent, said 3 persons were confirmed dead on arrival at the facility. He said the management of the hospital had assigned more consultants to the emergency unit to attend to the victims. While the survivors were showing signs of improvement, the hospital management was closely monitoring them, he added.

Our correspondent saw some of the survivors on life-support machines when he was allowed into the emergency unit of the hospital.

[Carbon monoxide (CO) is a deadly odorless, colorless, and tasteless gas most often associated with the fumes from burning fuel in some type of engine: a car, a small engine, a boiler, a gas furnace, or, as in this case, a generator. CO can build up, particularly indoors, and be the source of a poisoning of multiple people.

Carbon monoxide poisoning is caused by inhaling combustion fumes. CO is produced by burning gasoline, wood, propane, charcoal, or other fuel. Improperly ventilated appliances and engines, particularly in a tightly sealed or enclosed space, may allow carbon monoxide to accumulate to dangerous levels.

Carbon monoxide poisoning occurs when CO builds up in your bloodstream. When too much CO is in the air you're breathing, your body replaces the oxygen in your red blood cells with CO. This prevents oxygen from reaching your tissues and organs and can lead to serious tissue damage or even death. If you think you or someone that you're with may have carbon monoxide poisoning, get into fresh air and seek emergency medical care.

Signs and symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may include the following:
- Dull headache
- Weakness
- Dizziness
- Nausea or vomiting
- Shortness of breath
- Confusion
- Blurred vision
- Loss of consciousness

Carbon monoxide poisoning can be particularly dangerous for people who are sleeping or intoxicated. People may have irreversible brain damage or even die before anyone realizes there's a problem.

Various fuel-burning appliances and engines produce carbon monoxide. The amount of carbon monoxide produced by these sources usually isn't a cause for concern. But if they're used in a closed or partially closed space -- cooking with a charcoal grill indoors, for example -- the carbon monoxide can build to dangerous levels. Proper ventilation is critical when running engines including generators in closed spaces. Smoke inhalation during a fire also can cause carbon monoxide poisoning.

Carbon monoxide may be particularly dangerous for
- Children. Young children take breaths more frequently than adults do, which may make them more susceptible to carbon monoxide poisoning;
- Older adults. Older people who experience carbon monoxide poisoning may be more likely to develop brain damage;
- People who have chronic heart disease. People with a history of anemia and breathing problems also are more likely to get sick from exposure to carbon monoxide; and
- Those in whom carbon monoxide poisoning leads to unconsciousness. Loss of consciousness indicates more severe exposure.

Depending on the degree and length of exposure, carbon monoxide poisoning can cause
- Permanent brain damage;
- Damage to your heart, possibly leading to life-threatening cardiac complications; or
- Death.
