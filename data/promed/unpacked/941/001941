A steep rise in malaria cases has been registered in the western part of
Rajasthan. The districts of Jaisalmer and Barmer registered more than 1000
cases last week.

The disease has emerged strongly in the Pokran area of Jaisalmer, where 2
children reportedly died of malaria. "There had been 432 cases of malaria
reported from the district last week, among these, 410 were of PV malaria,
while 20 were of PF malaria [_Plasmodium falciparum_], 2 were of mixed kind
[_P. falciparum_ and _P. vivax_]," said chief medical and health officer
(CMHO), Jaisalmer, M L Purniya.

Across the state, malaria has been registered at a comparatively low
incidence this year [2010]; however, districts of Jaisalmer and Barmer have
seen an uptrend in the disease.

The figures are being viewed with apprehension, as there have only been 769
cases of malaria reported from Jaisalmer since January 2010, including the
patients reported last week.

The adjoining Barmer district has been facing a similar issue: "There were
513 new cases of malaria reported last week, of these, 4 were of malaria
PF," said CMHO Barmer Ganpat Singh. The district has so far reported 695
cases this year [2010].

According to the health department officials, antilarval activities have
been intensified in the affected areas, while arrangements have been made
for handling the rising number of patients. As the malaria-causing mosquito
usually breeds in shallow and clean water, household tanks, desert coolers,
and shallow ponds often become breeding grounds.

[Malaria is endemic in Rajasthan, but the increase in the number of cases
is substantial. Jaisalmer is about 150 km [93 miles] from the border of
Pakistan, and the increase in malaria cases is most likely not related to
the floods in Pakistan.
