Rift Valley fever, which has swept across Kenya, has spread to
neighboring Tanzania, killing 2 people, officials said. The deaths
were reported in the northern Arusha region last week, raising fears
of an outbreak, the area's regional commissioner Evans Balama told
AFP. "Two people have died of Rift Valley fever in Teradi village," he said.

The Health Ministry said the World Health Organization and government
doctors had been deployed in the area to combat the disease, which is
mainly spread by mosquitoes. The fever has killed at least 162 people
and infected hundreds in Kenya since it was first diagnosed in
mid-December [2006].

Victims of Rift Valley fever usually experience fever, generalized
weakness, back pain, dizziness, vomiting of blood and extreme weight
loss at the onset of the illness. Many patients recover within up to
a week but others die, experts say.

The fever was 1st [reported] in Kenya's Rift Valley region in the
1930s but has since been recorded elsewhere in Africa.

[The northern Arusha region of Tanzania is adjacent to the region of
Kenya experiencing the current outbreak of Rift Valley fever.
Appearance of cases of Rift Valley fever is not unexpected,
therefore, and it is evident that the outbreak has not yet been
contained. A map of Tanzania can be viewed at
