Outbreak of Unidentified Illness Now Confirmed as Yellow Fever in Northern
Uganda
---------------------------------------------------

After discussions with the Ugandan Ministry of Health and WHO, the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now confirms that the
undiagnosed severe illness reported in Mission Kampalaâs 30 Nov [2010] Warden
Message is an outbreak of yellow fever.

Although as many as 7 districts are now reporting cases -- including 2
possible cases from southern Sudan -- almost all of the reported
severe cases (characterized by fever, vomiting and bleeding) continue
to be concentrated in 3 districts of Northern Uganda, namely Abim
(specifically Morulem sub-county), Agago (Omiya PâChua, Adilang and
Paimoi sub-counties) and Kitgum (Orum, Namokora and Kitgum Town
Council).

In light of these findings, the U.S. Mission in Kampala recommends that U.S.
citizens residing and traveling in Uganda avoid travel to Northern Uganda
unless they have been vaccinated against yellow fever within the past 10
years. If vaccinated recently, do not travel to Northern Uganda for at
least 10 days after receiving the vaccination. (yellow fever vaccinations
do not take effect [induce immunity] for 10 days.) Only U.S. government
officials with yellow fever vaccinations are permitted to travel to the
affected areas.

[At last there is laboratory confirmation that the outbreak is due to yellow
fever virus infection. Confirmation has taken over a month. The outbreak
initially was suspected to be Ebola hemorrhagic fever, then amoebic
dysentery and later plague. This situation illustrates the difficulty in
getting definitive diagnosis when outbreaks occur in remote areas with
logistical and health care challenges. With a reliable laboratory confirmed
diagnosis, health officials now can mount an aggressive vaccination
campaign, assuming that the finances for it are forthcoming quickly.
