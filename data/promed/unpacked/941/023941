There is a report in The Lancet [Volume 353 Issue 9152 from the Laboratory
of Veterinary Medicine in Rome about a recent increase in transmissible
spongiform encephalopathy. TSE [Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy is
to the goats and sheep of Tuscany, Sicily, Sardinia and Apulia what BSE
[Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy - "mad cow" disease - has been to the
Friesian cows of Norfolk.
Veterinarians studying 20 outbreaks of TSE suggest that the timing of the
outbreaks (15 in the first six months of 1997) and the high incidence in
flocks (up to 90 per cent) imply that the spread of the disease probably
had an accidental cause. It is unusual for so many goats to be involved,
but on this occasion there have been more than 390 cases.
It seems unlikely that the sheep and goats were infected by contaminated
food, as some of the flocks affected the worst were receiving no food that
could have been infected by bonemeal or other animal protein.
The likely cause is thought to be the contamination of a vaccine prepared
with material from the brains and mammary glands of sheep. There are
several strains of TSE, with different properties, that may be capable of
affecting human beings. Also, there was an accidental outbreak in Scotland
in 1935 after the use of contaminated vaccine. It is not known whether
there was any increase in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease as a result.
