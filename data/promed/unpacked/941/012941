[For the location of the above outbreak in North-east South Africa,
see the map at the above URL.

According to OIE's data, the previous FMD outbreak in South Africa
commenced in Mpumalanga on 6 Sep 2009, caused by FMDV type SAT-1.
Reportedly, this outbreak resolved on 14 May 2010. For the immediate
notification, the 7 follow-up reports and a map showing the 4 foci, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8424>.

3 of South Africa's neighbours have reportedly been affected by FMD
during 2010. The most recent one is Botswana, which reported to the
OIE on 6 Aug 2010 an outbreak of FMDV serotype SAT-2 adjacent to
Zambia's border (see 20100808.2706). The same serotype was identified
in Botswana during 2009.

According to the April-June 2010 quarterly report of the FAO/OIE FMD
Reference Laboratory (Pirbright), 2 other of South Africa's
neighbours, Namibia and Zimbabwe, have undergone spread of FMD during 2010.

In Namibia, an outbreak of FMD type SAT-1 was reported on 9 Apr 2010
in cattle on Impalila island, Kabbe constituency, Caprivi. It was
suspected that transmission of FMDV occurred from wild African
buffalo (_Syncerus caffer_) resident in the area. This outbreak was
reported to the OIE; see reports and map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9143>.
Reportedly, the last clinical cases were seen on 6 May 2010. The
outbreak is now considered over as of 13 Aug 2010.

In Zimbabwe, an outbreak of FMD type SAT 2 was reported in cattle at
Kitwe dip tank, Plumtree, Mangwe, Matabeleland South on 28 May 2010.
Further outbreaks have been reported: on 4 Jun 2010 at Inswingo Dip
Tank, Mangwe, Matabeleland South; and on 1 Jun 2010 at Kwite, Mangwe,
Matabeleland South and Ingwizi Dip Tank, Mangwe, Matabeleland South.
The outbreak was reported to the OIE on 11 Jun 2010; see the reports
and map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9365>.
At the time of publication (July 2010), no sequence data was
available yet and samples were not yet submitted to the WRLFMD. Today
(17 Aug 2010) there is not yet such information available at the
accessed WRLFMD web-site (Zimbabwe page at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/zim.htm>).
