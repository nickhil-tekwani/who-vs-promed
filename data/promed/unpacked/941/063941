At least 13 more cattle heads succumbed to foot and mouth disease [FMD] at Ber Kalan village in Payal subdivision of Ludhiana district [Punjab] in the last 24 hours. The animal husbandry department officials are on their toes as 60 cattle have died of the disease in the village so far. Over 500 animals have been infected with the highly contagious disease since its outbreak last week [week of 2 Aug 2021]. 14 department teams are treating and vaccinating the animals in nearly a dozen villages in the surrounding area. The vaccination is being carried out in a radius of 3 km [2 mi] from the epicentre of the disease outbreak.

Veterinarians have advised the dairy farmers to keep the infected animals in isolation. Animal husbandry deputy director PS Walia said, "Regular vaccination drives are being conducted in the area to stop the disease spread. A large number of animals have recovered after being treated. The cattle which show symptoms like fever, sores, and blisters on feet should be isolated and treatment should be started by a certified veterinarian. The symptoms should not be ignored."

Payal MLA Lakhvir Singh Lakha visited Ber Kalan on Sunday [8 Aug 2021] and assured the residents that he will take up the issue with chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh for providing compensation to those who have lost their livestock. He also visited the house of dairy farmer [NS] (55) who committed suicide after losing 3 buffalos to the disease. Lakha said, "The villagers have also sought the establishment of a veterinary dispensary in the area. Compensation will also be sought for [NS's] family."

[Ludhiana is the largest of Punjab's 23 districts; it is bordered on its west by the Moga district, where an outbreak of FMD, causing mortalities in cattle, was recorded since early July 2021 (see 20210804.8569599). The event was, reportedly, at least partially attributed to vaccine failure.

The Indian subcontinent has been a source of FMD serotype O virus strains spreading internationally several times during recent decades. Hence, the success in controlling the disease in India, mainly depending upon the efficacy and safety of the vaccines applied, is of importance beyond this subcontinent (see 20141112.2949071).

Genotyping results of the FMD virus strains currently circulating in Punjab, and their matching rate of the applied vaccine, would be of interest. - Mod.AS
