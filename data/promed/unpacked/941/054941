[We continue our relentless search for evidence of the penetration of
cholera O139 into Europe, and for importations of cholera from countries
which deny they have it, such as Bangladesh, Egypt & Indonesia. We would
appreciate hearing from anyone who knows where these 2 cases were imported
from, and what type they were.
We would also remind Germany & the Netherlands that reporting imported cases
that occurred in June to WHO weeks later is scarcely in compliance with the
International Health Regulations, which mandate reporting of even a suspect
case of cholera within 24 hours - Mod.JW
