The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) [?Taiwan] reported Saturday
Taiwan's 1st imported case of valley fever [coccidioidomycosis] for
the year [2009], which involved a Taiwanese citizen returning
recently from the United States, where the disease is endemic.

This was the 3rd valley fever case ever recorded in Taiwan. The
previous 2 cases, also imported, were recorded in 2005 and 1991,
respectively, according to a statement issued by the CDC.

The latest case was a 30-year-old woman who was in the United States
between [1 Jul 2008] and [1 May 2009]. The infection was diagnosed [3
Jun 2009] through blood tests, the CDC said.

Valley fever is caused by _Coccidioides immitis_, a fungus commonly
found in the soil of desert regions in the United States, Mexico, and
Central and South America, the CDC said. People can be infected after
inhaling the fungus spores in the air. The disease is not spread from
person to person. While many infected persons display no symptoms,
some may develop fever, cough, chills, night sweats, headache, joint
aches, chest pain, and a red spotty rash. In some rare cases, the
infection can lead to pneumonia, meningitis, and even death.

Coccidioidomycosis is caused by the dimorphic fungus _Coccidioides
immitis_, which lives as mycelia in soil of desert areas of the
western hemisphere, mainly the American Southwest (the central San
Joaquin valley of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and the
western half of Texas). Other endemic areas are the regions of Mexico
that border the southwestern United States, some Central American
countries, including Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, and desert
regions of South America (Argentina, Paraguay, and Venezuela). As the
soil becomes dryer, the septated hyphae develop into arthroconidia,
which disarticulate as single fungal cells and become airborne when
disturbed by wind or soil excavation. Arthroconidia measure 3-5
microns and remain viable for long periods of time. When inhaled,
arthroconidia convert in the lung into thick-walled spherules filled
with endospores. Once released, each endospore can start the
development of a new spherule and extend the infection.

Coccidioidomycosis is not transmitted from person to person. Risk of
infection is highest in dry summer months. A 2nd period of risk
usually occurs in the late fall, terminating with winter rains. Dust
exposure is critical for acquiring an infection. Indeed, an outbreak
of coccidioidomycosis followed exposure to a dust cloud that was
blown downwind from the January 1994, 6.7 magnitude Northridge
California earthquake and its after shocks (CDC. Coccidioidomycosis
following the Northridge earthquake -- California, 1994. JAMA. Jun 8
1994; 271(22): 1735). Because the incubation period for this
infection usually ranges from 1 to 4 weeks, persons who may have
become infected while visiting areas where coccidioidomycosis is
endemic may not become ill until after they return home, and the
diagnosis may not be considered by clinicians in areas where
coccidioidomycosis is not endemic.

Approximately 60 percent of infected persons are asymptomatic; the
remainder can develop manifestations that range from mild to moderate
influenza-like illness to pneumonia that may be associated with
erythema nodosum, especially in females. Progressive pulmonary
disease may occur, or the infection may spread from the primary
respiratory focus outside the lung. Overall, less than 5 percent of
infected persons have progressive pulmonary infection or
extrapulmonary dissemination of the disease. Extra-pulmonary spread
of the infection tends to occur more commonly in the
immunocompromised host, such as, organ transplant patients, patients
receiving high-dose corticosteroids, and patients with HIV infection,
in pregnant women, and in certain ethic groups (persons of African,
Asian, and, to a lesser extent, Hispanic descent). Sites that are
associated with extra-pulmonary spread include the skin, the skeletal
system, and the meninges.

Acute coccidioidomycosis can be diagnosed by culture of clinical
specimens and by serologic tests. Immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibodies
appear within the 1st 3 weeks after onset of symptoms while IgG
antibodies appear 1-2 months after onset of symptoms. IgG antibodies
usually outlasts the IgM, persisting in chronic coccidioidomycosis
and its quantitation provides an indicator of disease progression
(increasing titer) or regression (decreasing titer). Detection of IgG
antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid is important for the diagnosis
coccidioidal meningitis.
