On Tuesday [26 Jun 2007], 2 more Vietnamese provinces officially became
bird flu-free, with Son La and Nam Dinh in the north reporting no new
outbreaks in the last 21 days. [Son La and Nam Dinh are, respectively, No
51 and No 39 on the map at
<http://www.angelfire.com/co/hongnam/vnmap.html>. - Mod AS]
There are 12 provinces and cities, mostly in the north, which remain on the
list. Outside the north, only Can Tho city [No 18 on the map] in the south
and Quang Nam province [No 46 on the map] remain in the grip of the epidemic.
The Ministry of Agriculture stipulates that if a province has no new
outbreak for 21 days, it is considered to be free from bird flu.
Bac Ninh province [No 9 on the map] was taken off the list on Sunday [24
Jun 2007].
Meanwhile, 2 new infected sites were discovered in Quang Nam province.
Deputy minister of agriculture, Bui Ba Bong, warned on Tuesday [26 Jun
2007] that the epidemic could hit the south since the region is set for its
autumn-summer rice harvest before which farmers tend to leave their fowls
roam freely to find food.
A woman died of the H5N1 strain of bird flu last week [18-24 Jun 2007] in
the northern Ha Nam Province [No 25 on the map], the 2nd person to die in
11 days.
Since May [2007], 18 provinces and cities have been affected in which 5
humans contracted the H5N1 strain of the disease and 2 died, taking the
total death toll since 2003 to 44.
Of the 65 provinces and cities, 44 have completed this year's [2007] 1st
round of vaccination for 83.86 million chickens, 59.39 million ducks, and
3.47 million white-winged ducks.

Sources reveal that possibility of bird flu is rising in Taxila [Punjab
province] and adjoining areas after supply of sick chickens that later died
in the shops. Further, it has been reported that shopkeepers are purchasing
ailing chickens at [low prices] and later selling them at higher prices.

[3] Czech Republic: 2nd outbreak, H5

Bird flu was discovered at a broiler farm in Norin, east Bohemia, but the
presence of the highly dangerous H5N1 strain has been neither confirmed nor
disproved yet, Czech State Veterinary Administration spokesman, Josef
Duben, told CTK today [27 Jun 2007].
Norin is located 4 km (2.5 mi) from Tisova, where the 1st Czech case of the
H5N1 strain of bird flu among bred poultry was revealed at a turkey farm
last week [18-24 Jun 2007].
Duben said that tests proved bird flu in 60 cases at the farm with 27 800
broilers. He said the broilers tested positive for the H5 strain and
further tests are to show whether it is H5N1 or not.
The turkeys bred at Tisova got infected through hay litter, while the
broilers allegedly got into indirect contact with a carrier of the virus,
man or bird.
As in Tisova, the poultry at the Norin farm will be culled and liquidated,
the area disinfected, and strict measures applied in the vicinity.
The 1st bird flu case in the Czech Republic was discovered in March 2006.
Since then another 13 cases of swans living in the wild have been registered.

[Final laboratory results on the new H5 event are expected.
If the turkeys in the index outbreak got -- as alleged in the report --
infected through hay litter, then a previous outbreak should have occurred
elsewhere or the hay got contaminated from wild birds.
In their notification to the OIE (Office International des Epizooties;
World Organization for Animal Health) of 22 Jun 2007 on the Tisova
outbreak, the Czech authorities reported that the diagnosis was
accomplished by their National laboratory at the State Veterinary Institute
(SVI), by gene sequencing and RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction). The source of infection was reported as "unknown or
inconclusive". See the notification, including a map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5626>.
It may be assumed that samples have been forwarded to an OIE reference
laboratory. Anticipated results of the molecular studies and phylogenetic
analysis, carried out by the relevant OIE reference laboratory, may help
the attempts to unfold the possible origin of infection. - Mod.AS]
