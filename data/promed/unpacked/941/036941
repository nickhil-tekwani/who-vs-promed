On Tue 28 Aug 2012, the [Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (AFSCA by its initials in French)] was informed that 20 of the 22 children in a day care center in Borgerhout [Antwerp province] became sick with vomiting soon after eating a meal. The AFSCA immediately conducted a thorough inspection of the establishment. Several samples of leftover food and vomit were collected. They were immediately sent for analysis at the Scientific Institute of Public Health (ISP [by its initials in French]).

_Bacillus cereus_ and its toxin were detected in the food and vomit samples. This bacterium can be found naturally in some plant products, including rice and vegetables.

When prepared meals are [not properly refrigerated], the bacteria can multiply and release a toxin. This toxin, which is not destroyed by heat, is responsible for the foodborne illness. It is therefore important to prepare and store food properly to prevent bacterial growth and the presence of toxin. As always with many pathogens, the contaminated food does not change taste and odor.

[The nature of the children's meal is not stated.

_Bacillus cereus_ food poisoning is the general name used for the illness. However, the organism has 2 recognized types of foodborne illness: diarrheal and emetic. The emetic syndrome is caused by cereulide, a heat- and pH-stable peptide toxin. Consumption of food contaminated with this toxin may lead to emesis between 0.5 and 5 hours after ingestion. The symptoms of this illness mimic those of _Staphylococcus aureus_ food poisoning.

The diarrheal illness (more common in North America and Europe) is caused by a high molecular weight protein while the emetic or vomiting type (commoner in Japan than the diarrheal type) of food poisoning is caused by a low molecular weight and heat-stable protein. In some outbreaks there seems to be an overlap between the diarrheal and the emetic types of illness [as in the report above].

The symptoms of _B. cereus_ diarrheal type food poisoning include abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, rectal tenesmus, moderate nausea that may accompany diarrhea, seldom vomiting, and no fever. Symptoms develop within 6-15 hours and can persist for 24 hours. This syndrome is rather mild and tends to mimic the symptoms of _Clostridium perfringens_ food poisoning. The diarrheal syndrome is caused by enterotoxins that are produced during growth of _B. cereus_ in the small intestine.

Generally, symptoms are transient and mild, possibly contributing to underreporting. Large numbers of cells are needed to cause illness and can occur when the food product (often rice) is held at a temperature inadequate to prevent growth. Despite the illness's usual mild symptoms, fatalities have been described associated with liver failure (Mahler H, Pasi A, Kramer JM, et al: Fulminant liver failure in association with the emetic toxin of _Bacillus cereus_. N Engl J Med 1997; 336(16): 1142-8; available at http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199704173361604). - Mod.LL
