The Department of Health (DOH) in Taiwan announced yesterday [11 Jan
2008] the 1st case of hantavirus hemorrhagic fever on the island this
year. Lin Ting, deputy director of DOH's Centers for Disease Control,
said the patient, a 46-year-old Taiwan businessman who travels
frequently to Inner Mongolia in China, had contact with rats when he
was disposing of rats he trapped on a sticky plate last month in
Inner Mongolia.

The man developed a fever on 12 Dec [2007] and had difficulty
urinating by 15 Dec [2007]. He sought treatment at a Mongolian
hospital. His condition turned for the better after dialysis.

He returned to Taiwan on 5 Jan [2008] and checked into a hospital on
7 Jan [2008]. The CDC confirmed that he had contracted the virus.
Fortunately, family members of the man were not infected, Lin said.

Most rats and mice carry the hantavirus, and chronic cases of the
disease have been reported in Taiwan, Lin said, noting that there was
one case in 2001 and 3 cases in 2004 and another 3 cases in 2006. The
best way to avoid being infected is to have no contact with rats or
mice, Lin said, urging the public to keep their environment clean.

Carriers of the virus tend to be rodents that frequent the sewers and
garbage dumps [in the case of Seoul virus and its _Rattus_ hosts, but
not for Hantaan virus and its field mouse host. - Mod.TY], Lin said.
But for those pet rats that are artificially bred since birth, the
possibility of them carrying the virus is low, Lin said, noting the
fad of keeping mice as pets in 2008 may be popular as this year is
the year of rat on the Chinese zodiac.

[Although this article does not specify the hantavirus involved, it
is probable that the patient was infected by one of 2 hantaviruses
commonly found in China, Hantaan virus and Seoul virus. In ProMED
archive no. 20001126.2056, Mod.CP commented, "There are 2 common
hantaviruses in China, which are regarded as distinct virus species
-- Hantaan virus and Seoul virus. Hantaan virus has several (up to 5
now according to the article cited) subtypes and is transmitted by
the field mouse _Apodemus agrarius_, whereas Seoul virus is less
variable and is transmuted by the rat _Rattus norvegicus_. " China
has more Hantaan virus infections than any other country -- over 1
million recorded up to the year 2000. Because these non-arthropod
borne bunyaviruses are transmitted via contact with rodent
excretions, international and Chinese public health authorities
recommend avoiding areas where rodents are abundant -- something that
can be extremely difficult to do in East Asia.
