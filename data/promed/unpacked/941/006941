LAKEWOOD, Colorado: Plague (caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_) has
infected prairie dogs near Bear Creek Lake Park, and the disease could be
spreading among rodents from Morrison to Green Mountain Open Space Park.
Health officials are advising park visitors and residents to stay away from
rodents. Plague can be carried by various rodents besides prairie dogs,
including squirrels, mice, pack rats, and rock squirrels.
Signs posted along trails in Bear Creek Lake Park warn horse and bike
riders to stay away from the prairie dog colony between the lake and US
Highway 285. Almost the whole colony has been wiped out, but no human
infections have been reported. The plague bacillus is carried by fleas on
rodents. It causes sudden high fever, chills, headache, and swelling and
extreme pain in a lymph node typically in the groin or axilla. [classic
signs of the bubonic form of plague. - Mod.TG
Human infection from plague-carrying rodents is rare, but at least one or 2
human cases are reported to the state each year. In half the cases, family
pets have had contact with a rodent and brought the infected fleas home.
Since 1957, 48 human cases have been recorded in Colorado, 7 of which were
linked to prairie dogs, with the remaining cases stemming from other
rodents, pet contact, or undetermined causes, according to John Pape, an
epidemiologist with the Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment. Two of the 7 cases caused by infected prairie dogs were people
who skinned infected prairie dogs.
The infection among rodents is cyclical, with the plague passing through
colonies every 5 to 10 years. The last severe infestation occurred from
1992 to 1994, hitting colonies across the state. This year, the plague in
prairie dog colonies has been reported in Adams, Pueblo, and Larimer
counties, said Jim Dale, Jefferson County's director of environmental
health services.

[Prairie dogs are often sentinel animals, as they are extremely sensitive
to _Yersinia pestis_. Prairie dogs and other rodents most often pass plague
to cats. Lymph nodes on the cat may rupture in the hand of the owner,
veterinarian, or a child. Bacteria on the hand can easily be transmitted to
the face or enter the body through other cutaneous abrasions. Bubonic
plague may become systemic, invading the lungs and can be passed
pneumonically. Cat-associated human plague often results in the pneumonic
form of plague in humans (5 of the 23 reported cases in the article: Gage
KL, Dennis DT, Orloski KA, Ettestad P, Brown TL, Reynolds PJ, et al. Cases
of cat-associated human plague in the Western US, 1977-1998. Clin Infect
Dis 2000; 30(6): 893-900). Outbreaks in rodent populations should be
considered serious. - Mod.TG
