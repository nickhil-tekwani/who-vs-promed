[This past week showed a shift in that the majority of AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases confirmed/reported during the week were associated with WPV1 infection, while the number of AFP cases associated with cVDPV infection were "only" 5. Lest one start celebrating, the number of positive environmental samples for cVDPV was ample to suggest ongoing widespread transmission of the cVDPVs. (Note that the WPV1 cases reported in Pakistan and one of the Ghana cVDPV2 cases had been covered on ProMED during the week from media reports on the confirmations: Poliomyelitis update (103): global (WPV1, cVDPV) Pakistan, nOPV2 soon to release 20191220.6850114, Poliomyelitis update (102): Pakistan (BA,KP,SD) 20191219.6848225, Poliomyelitis update (101): Ghana, RFI 20191218.6845754, Poliomyelitis update (100): Pakistan (PB, SD, KP) 20191216.6842210, Poliomyelitis update (99): global (WPV & cVDPV), Pakistan (KP), Afghanistan (BL) 20191212.6837355).

I highly recommend the excerpt in [2] below from Helen Branswell, written for Stat News. It is an excellent review of the concerns and challenges facing the polio eradication effort moving forward.

For a map showing the locations of both WPV-associated cases and cVDPV-associated cases, see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12 months below. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 24 countries: 15 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 4 in the Western Pacific, with either WPV or cVDPV isolates in their countries. An important reminder is that positive environmental samples means that the virus is circulating in the area where the samples have been obtained. Hence, if a susceptible individual is infected with the virus, there is a chance the person may develop paralytic disease.

[2] Commentary on challenges to the polio eradication effort - media report
Date: Thu 26 Dec 2019

3 challenges to watch in global health in 2020
----------------------------------------------
Houston, we've got a polio problem.

Polio eradication has made STAT's watch list every year we've done these predictions. Earlier predictions have been at least moderately more upbeat. But after 2019, prospects look unsettling.

True, the 2nd of the 3 poliovirus species -- type 3 -- was declared eradicated, joining type 2 viruses in the history books. But type 1 stubbornly hangs on in Pakistan and Afghanistan, where the number of children paralyzed in 2019 was more than 3 times higher than in 2018. In other words, things are going in the wrong direction.

But the really alarming news on the polio eradication front relates to vaccine-derived polioviruses: the weakened but live viruses used in oral polio vaccine that on occasion regain the power to paralyze.

In 2016, type 2 viruses were taken out of the oral vaccine, used mainly in developing countries. It was done in a synchronized withdrawal designed to minimize the risks that type 2 vaccine viruses would continue to circulate and infect the growing cohort of children who weren't immunized against type 2.

Tragically, the maneuver, called "the switch," did not go according to plan.

The expectation was that 3.5 years after the withdrawal, outbreaks caused by the type 2 vaccine viruses would be dwindling. Instead, they are picking up steam.

At least 17 countries reported finding type 2 vaccine-derived viruses, and more than 200 children have been paralyzed by them. Much of the trouble is happening in sub-Saharan Africa, where vaccination campaigns to stop the spread of the vaccine viruses aren't as aggressive as they need to be and aren't reaching enough children. A recent report from an independent board that monitors polio eradication termed the situation a crisis.

Much hope is being placed on a new vaccine being developed at warp speed. Also administered orally -- a feature that is key to mass-vaccination efforts -- it contains vaccine viruses that were modified so that they won't be able to regain their paralytic powers as easily, if at all. So far, the data look good, but how well the new vaccine actually works and how likely it is to revert to paralytic form won't be known until it's used widely.

If all goes well, it could truly be a silver bullet. But as the Independent Monitoring Board's report warned, a lot can go wrong with vaccine development, and there doesn't appear to be a plan B. There are lots of white knuckles here. Consider 2020 a pivotal year for polio eradication.

[Helen Branswell is right on target, highlighting the concerns facing the polio eradication effort, especially those posed by the existing OPV2 and the resultant cVDPV2 outbreaks associated with it. Will the new vaccine nOPV2 (novel OPV2) will be the hoped-for silver bullet? We won't know until a few years following its introduction and vaccination of millions of susceptible children. (See Poliomyelitis update (103): global (WPV1, cVDPV) Pakistan, nOPV2 soon to release 20191220.6850114 for more detailed comments on this).

Happy Holidays to all with wishes for a bright 2020 with interruption of transmission of WPV1 in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and interruption of transmission of all cVDPV1, cVDPV2, and cVDPV3s globally. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Statement of the 23rd IHR Emergency Committee Re: Poliovirus
Date: Fri 20 Dec 2019
Source: WHO Press Release [edited]
https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/20-12-2019-statement-o-the-twenty-third-ihr-emergency-committee-regarding-the-international-spread-of-poliovirus


Statement of the 23rd IHR Emergency Committee Regarding the International Spread of Poliovirus
20 Dec 2019
--------------------------
The 23rd meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the director-general on [11 Dec 2019] at WHO headquarters with members, advisers, and invited member states attending via teleconference, supported by the WHO secretariat.

The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV). The secretariat presented a report of progress for affected IHR States Parties subject to Temporary Recommendations. The following IHR States Parties provided an update on the current situation and the implementation of the WHO Temporary Recommendations since the committee last met on [16 Sep 2019]: Afghanistan, Angola, Benin, Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Togo, and Zambia.

Wild poliovirus
The committee remains gravely concerned by the significant increase in WPV1 cases globally to 113 as [of] [11 Dec 2019], compared to 28 for the same period in 2018, with no significant success yet in reversing this trend.

In Pakistan transmission continues to be widespread, as indicated by both AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) surveillance and environmental sampling. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province continues to be of particular concern. The issues noted previously by the committee, including refusal by individuals and communities to accept vaccination, and problems with politicization of the national polio program are still being addressed. Added pressure is now on the program due to confirmation of detection of cVDPV2 in several provinces (see below).

In Afghanistan, the security situation remains very challenging. Inaccessible and missed children particularly in the Southern Region represent a large cohort of susceptible children in this part of Afghanistan. The risk of a major upsurge of cases is growing, with other parts of the country that have been free of WPV1 for some time now at risk of outbreaks. This would again increase the risk of international spread. Major efforts must be made to improve access if eradication efforts are going to progress.

The committee noted that based on sequencing of viruses, there were recent instances of international spread of viruses from Pakistan to Afghanistan and also from Afghanistan to Pakistan. The recent increased frequency of WPV1 international spread between the 2 countries suggests that rising transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan correlates with increasing risk of WPV1 exportation beyond the single epidemiological block formed by the 2 countries.

The committee noted the continued cooperation and coordination between Afghanistan and Pakistan, particularly in reaching high-risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border and welcomed the all-age vaccination now being taken at key border points between the 2 countries.

In Nigeria, there has been no WPV1 detected for 3 years, and it is possible that the African Region may be certified WPV-free in 2020. The committee again commended the strong efforts to reach inaccessible and trapped children in Borno, Nigeria, even in the face of increased insecurity. The certification of WPV3 eradication was also welcomed by the committee and underlines that polioviruses can be eradicated.

Vaccine-derived poliovirus
The multiple cVDPV outbreaks in 4 WHO regions (African, Eastern Mediterranean, South-east Asian, and Western Pacific regions) are very concerning, with 7 new countries reporting outbreaks since the last meeting (Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Togo, and Zambia). Since the last meeting, cVDPV2 has spread through West Africa and the Lake Chad area, reaching Cote d'Ivoire, Togo, and Chad, and cVDPV1 has spread from the Philippines to Malaysia.

The rapid emergence of multiple cVDPV2 strains in several countries is unprecedented and very concerning, and not yet fully understood.

The committee noted that the GPEI was developing a strategy to address cVDPV2 outbreaks but was extremely concerned that the monovalent OPV2 stockpile was becoming depleted. The committee strongly supports the development and proposed Emergency Use Listing of the novel OPV2 vaccine, which should become available mid-2020, and which, it is hoped, will result in no or very little seeding of further outbreaks.

Conclusion
The committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The committee recognizes the concerns regarding the lengthy duration of the polio PHEIC, but concludes that the current situation is extraordinary, with clear ongoing risk of international spread and ongoing need for coordinated international response. The committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:

Rising risk of WPV1 international spread: The progress made in recent years appears to have reversed, with the committee's assessment that the risk of international spread is at the highest point since 2014 when the PHEIC was declared. This risk assessment is based on the following:
- the WPV1 exportation in 2019 from Pakistan to Iran and to Afghanistan and, more recently, spread from Afghanistan to Pakistan;
- ongoing rise in the number of WPV1 cases and positive environmental samples in Pakistan, and, to a lesser extent, Afghanistan;
- the quickly increasing cohort of unvaccinated children in Afghanistan, with the risk of a major outbreak imminent if nothing is done to access these children;
- the urgent need to overhaul the leadership and strategy of the program in Pakistan, which although already commenced, is likely to take some time to lead to more effective control of transmission and ultimately eradication;
- increasing community and individual resistance to the polio program.

Rising risk of cVDPV international spread:
The clearly documented spread in recent months of cVDPV2 from Nigeria to Chad, Cote d'Ivoire and Togo, and between Philippines and Malaysia demonstrate the unusual nature of the current situation, as international spread of cVDPV in the past has been very infrequent. The emergence of cVDPV2 in Zambia, which had not used mOPV2, raises further concern. The risk of new outbreaks in new countries is considered extremely high, even probable. The outbreak of cVDPV1 in Malaysia in a cross-border population shared between Malaysia, Philippines, and Indonesia and which is often unreached by government immunization programs is an example of how border populations are at special risk.

Falling PV2 immunity:
Global population mucosal immunity to type 2 polioviruses (PV2) continues to fall, as the cohort of children born after OPV2 withdrawal grows, exacerbated by poor coverage with IPV, particularly in some of the cVDPV-infected countries.

Multiple outbreaks:
The evolving and unusual epidemiology resulting in rapid emergence and evolution of cVDPV2 strains is extraordinary and not yet fully understood and represents an additional risk that is yet to be quantified.

Weak routine immunization:
Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by various humanitarian emergencies, and the number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses a growing risk, leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to outbreaks of polio.

Surveillance gaps:
The appearance of highly diverged VDPVs in the Philippines, Somalia, and Indonesia are examples of inadequate polio surveillance, heightening concerns that transmission could be missed in various countries. Furthermore, the missed transmission in China for a year illustrates that even countries with generally good surveillance can miss VDPV transmission.

Lack of access:
Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e., Afghanistan, Nigeria, Niger, Somalia, Myanmar, and Indonesia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.

Population movement:
The risk is amplified by population movement, whether for family, social, economic, or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. There is a need for international coordination to address these risks. A regional approach and strong cross­border cooperation is required to respond to these risks, as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders.

Risk categories
The committee provided the director-general with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows:

- states infected with WPV1, cVDPV1, or cVDPV3, with potential risk of international spread;
- states infected with cVDPV2, with potential risk of international spread;
- states no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV.

Criteria to assess states as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV:

- Poliovirus case: 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case plus one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing, and reporting period, or when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer.

- Environmental or other isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case): 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample (such as from a healthy child) plus one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period.

- These criteria may be varied for the endemic countries, where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps (e.g., Borno state, Nigeria)

Once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected, the country will be considered vulnerable for a further 12 months. After this period, the country will no longer be subject to Temporary Recommendations, unless the committee has concerns based on the final report.

[More details listing countries fitting into each of the above-mentioned categories with recommendations are available at the source URL.]

Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPV, and the reports provided by affected countries, the director-general accepted the committee's assessment and on [19 Dec 2019] determined that the situation relating to poliovirus continues to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV. The director-general endorsed the committee's recommendations for countries meeting the definition for "states infected with WPV1, cVDPV1, or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread," "states infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread," and for "states no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV" and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective [19 Dec 2019].
