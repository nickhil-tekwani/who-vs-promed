With more than a dozen people in the Malnad region [in Shimoga district] infected by Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), which is generally known as monkey fever, Karnataka's Health Minister UT Khadar has urged the people of the Malnad region and those residing adjacent to forest areas to take all precautionary steps to prevent spreading of money fever.

Khadar, who spoke to reporters after holding a meeting with officials of the Health Department in Bangalore on Saturday [1 Mar 2014], said 24 cases of money fever have been reported from Thirthahalli and other parts of Shimoga and Chikmagalur districts. Out of 90 cases reported, blood tests have confirmed 24 cases of money fever. The disease has not claimed any lives so far, the minister said.

The officials of the department have been instructed to ensure availability of medicines at the primary health centres to check the spread of money fever and other communicable diseases during the summer.

[The disease was 1st detected in Shimoga district, Karnataka state in 1957 and has since appeared sporadically in the thickly wooded areas of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Chikmagalur, Shimoga, and Chamarajanagar (all in Karnataka state), where it is endemic. The increased rate of illegal felling of trees and deforestation has been blamed as one of the reasons for the outbreaks of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD). The disease occurs in humans and monkeys.

Although the virus has been isolated from 16 species of ticks, _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector. Most human cases occur during the dry season. The only way to prevent occurrence of additional cases is to avoid tick bites. KFD virus is a member of the _Flaviviridae_ family. Additional information is available from the CDC fact sheet (see: http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/KyasanurForestDis.pdf).
