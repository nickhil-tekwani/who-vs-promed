Reasons for the increased prevalence of Hand, Foot & mouth Disease
------------------------------------------------------------------
SINGAPORE: Records show that periodic outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth
disease (HFMD) have hit Singapore since 1972, even though the current
[outbreak is probably the island's biggest. This leads many to wonder why
the latest outbreak -- nearly 2200 HFMD cases reported since 1 Oct 2000 --
had reached such an unprecedented level and escalated within such a short
span of time. Someone who has a good idea of the underlying reasons is Dr
Tay Chong Hai, 69, a consultant physician at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, who
in 1972 was the first to identify the disease here.
He attributed the presence of more preschools and child-care facilities as a
contributing factor. "With more children clustered together at child-care
centres, the chances of children spreading the virus are greater," he said.
"Back in 1972, children congregated only in playgrounds or void decks of HDB
flats. Now, with more and more dual-income families and more working
parents, child-care arrangements have become the norm."
When HFMD first broke out in Singapore in 1972, it affected 104 people and
lasted for 3-1/2 months, from late September 1972 to mid-January 1973,
[according to the Singapore Medical Association's medical journal in 1974.
Subsequently, HFMD outbreaks took place once every few years. In 1981, there
were 742 cases. After 1987, when it became compulsory for child-care centres
to report HFMD cases, a yearly average of 425 cases were reported from 1994
to 1998.
Dr Tay said there is now a greater awareness among family doctors of the
disease. And because they have to report such cases, this has also pushed up
the numbers. "In the early days, many doctors didn't know about the disease
and mistook it for various other conditions, like mosquito bites, scabies
and ulcers. Besides, because HFMD is mild and self-limiting, with those
affected recovering after a few days, cases in the past rarely reached
hospitals for investigation."
"The latest outbreak will not be the last", he added. "HFMD is a mild
childhood disease that is endemic in Singapore, which means it will always
be around. There will be a lot of people carrying the disease without
knowing it. Cases will occur every now and then. But a large outbreak will
take place only every 3 to 5 years." Some ways, he suggested, of
preventing the next attack could include setting up sentinel centres in
polyclinics, where doctors and parents could send suspected patients for
clinical and laboratory confirmation. This was done by Taiwan during its
1998 HFMD outbreak. Regular screening of potential carriers -- parents,
maids and child-care personnel -- is another.
Genetic predisposition may be one reason why 2 siblings died from HFMD
last month. This was cited by Dr Ling Ai Ee, one of the principal
investigating virologists in the joint ministerial taskforce on HFMD.
Virologists from Singapore General Hospital's pathology department and from
the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta have found enterovirus 71 (EV71)
-- one among [several viruses associated with HFMD -- from the body tissues
of the 2 siblings.
