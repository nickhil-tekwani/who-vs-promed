State and federal wildlife managers are investigating a possible outbreak of avian cholera in ducks after members of the public reported several hundred dead ducks at wetlands on private land in the Stanfield and Milton-Freewater areas [Umatilla County] over the weekend [28-29 Jan 2017].

ODFW [Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife] is still waiting on tests to confirm whether the dead ducks collected died from cholera. However, Washington Fish and Wildlife [WDFW] recently confirmed an outbreak of avian cholera around nearby Burbank, Washington.

ODFW, WDFW, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service are working to minimize the spread of the disease through careful carcass collection and disposal to reduce the amount of bacteria in the environment.

Avian cholera is caused by the bacterium _Pasteurella multocida_ and is one of the most common diseases among ducks, geese, and other wild North American waterfowl. Symptoms displayed by infected birds include lethargy, convulsions, swimming in circles, and erratic flight plus mucous discharge from the mouth and nose, and soiling of the feathers around the vent, eyes, and bill.

According to the USGS [United States Geological Survey] National Wildlife Health Center, the bacteria kill waterfowl swiftly, sometimes in as few as 6 to 12 hours after infection. Live bacteria released into the environment by dead and dying birds can subsequently infect healthy birds. Avian cholera is highly contagious and spreads rapidly through bird-to-bird contact, ingestion of food or water containing the bacteria, or scavenging of infected carcasses.

While the risk to people from the disease is extremely low, ODFW urges the public to avoid handling sick or dead birds. Though hunting seasons in the area are now closed, hunters should wear gloves when cleaning birds and disinfect waders, decoys and other hunting equipment to stop further spread of the bacteria and harvested waterfowl should be cooked thoroughly prior to consumption. Finally, keep your pets away from sick birds.

[Avian cholera is a disease caused by the bacterium _Pasteurella multocida_. Bacteria released into the environment by dead and dying birds, or by birds carrying the disease, can subsequently infect healthy birds. In addition, dense concentrations of waterfowl can enhance disease transmission to susceptible birds. As a result, avian cholera can spread quickly through a wetland, killing thousands of birds in a single outbreak. Pickup and disposal of carcasses has become the primary management strategy to reduce transmission to susceptible birds.

The relationship between avian cholera and environmental factors is not entirely clear-cut. Associations between outbreaks and drought are inconsistent. Some researchers found a positive correlation with precipitation. Others suggest that absence of rain lead to high concentration of waterfowl leading to unusual high mortality. - Mod.PMB
