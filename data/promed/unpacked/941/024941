On 25 Jun 2009, a cow on an estancia with 75 head of "British breed"
aborted in the Partido de Tres Arroyos. The estancia veterinarian sent
the abortus to the local diagnostic laboratory, where _B. anthracis_
was cultured, and when injected into a mouse, killed it in 28 hours,
confirming the identification and pathogenicity. The cow herself died
within 48 hours of aborting, and _B. anhracis_ was recovered from the
cow's metacarpus [This is the Argentine standard tissue submission. -
Mod.MHJ]. At this time, we are presuming that the abortion was
associated with the anthrax septicaemia.

Anthrax had never before been recorded on this estancia. The livestock
had, however, been vaccinated 60 days previously. It is now winter,
and they recently had their 1st frost. There has been rain.

There are problems properly disposing of the infected carcass.

[To be frank, this is the 1st time I have seen abortion associated
with a clinical case of anthrax. It is logical that the 2 might occur
together, but possibly, and usually, the disease is so hyper-acute
that death intervenes before abortion can be completed. Maybe other
members have witnessed what I have missed. - Mod MHJ]
