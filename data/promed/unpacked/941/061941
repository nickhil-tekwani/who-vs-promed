[1] Canada (Alberta): coyote, human exposure

At least 3 women were bitten by a coyote within minutes of each other in the Tuscany area Saturday night [26 Jun 2021], says one of the victims.

[PO] said she was celebrating her high school graduation with 2 friends, drinking Slurpees [frozen carbonated drink] in a field in the northwest neighbourhood around 8 p.m. when they noticed what they thought was a dog approaching them. "There were people around us walking their dogs, so we thought it was another dog," said [PO], 18. She said the curious canine looked at her 2 female friends, then made a beeline for her.

"I thought he was going to sip my Slurpee, which was a few feet away from me, but he came around and bit me on the side of the hip," said [PO]. "I stood up and he just walked away." The coyote, she said, was dirty, skinny, and seemingly "desperate for food."

The teen said she went to the Foothills Medical Centre for treatment and while waiting in emergency encountered 2 other women who'd been attacked by a coyote in the same area of Tuscany within 2 hours of her encounter.

Healthcare officials, she said, didn't have enough rabies kits to treat all of the women, though one of them was discharged quickly because her wounds were minor.

Social media posts and [PO] said one of the other victims had been bitten on her thigh while sitting on her porch.

"I hope they find him before he gets hold of a child," said [PO], who was released from hospital 12 hours after arriving. "I'm still pretty sore."

A man said his mother had been attacked on her porch in Tuscany [see article below] while talking on her phone shortly after [PO] was bitten. "She was not walking around or going anywhere near its den, the attack is seemingly unprovoked," said the man, who didn't give his name.

"The wound was serious and fairly deep, and she had to be taken to hospital and is currently undergoing treatment for rabies."

He said the victims believe the same coyote is responsible for all 3 attacks given their time and proximity to each other, adding the community is in fear.

"Tuscany is a family community (with) many small children and pets, and members of the community are hoping the city can deal with this problem coyote swiftly," he said in an email.

Neighbourhood Facebook pages for Tuscany and surrounding communities are rife with postings and warnings over coyote and bobcat sightings.

Last week, a family in Rocky Ridge said a coyote had killed and dismembered a neighbour's cat in their backyard.

The incidents come in the wake of a trio of coyote bitings in the northwest area of Nolan Hill earlier this month [June 2021].

City officials say a contractor tracked down what they believed to be the culprit in those incidents last Tuesday [22 Jun 2021] and destroyed it.

They also said some Calgarians have been leaving food out for coyotes and other wild animals, a practice they say emboldens and attracts the animals.

A city official on Sunday [27 Jun 2021] said they're aware of the Tuscany incidents, adding they'd received a number of 311 calls involving aggressive animals in this particular community earlier in the week.

"Our hazing efforts have included frequently using loud noises in an effort to change the coyote's behaviour and encourage it to move out of the community," Sean Somers said in a statement.

"The City will investigate this latest claim and if it's proven the coyote's aggression is becoming an increasing risk to local residents, it will be permanently removed from the community as a last resort."

The city, he said, has received 20 per cent fewer 311 coyote calls so far this year [2021] compared to the same time frame in 2020.

[2] Canada (Alberta): coyote, human exposure

[Please note, the articles in [1] and [2] were published on the same day. The 1st part of this article is very similar to the article in [1]. But the last half of this article is very different, and has been posted here. - Mod.TG]

[HR] was sitting on her deck, chatting to her sister on the phone, when she was attacked.

"I had just turned my head, was leaning over, had my leg exposed ... and all of a sudden I felt something and turned," she said. "It was a skinny, scary, rabid-looking coyote ... very scary, very disturbing." She stood up, and the animal dove in and bit her again.

HR runs a day home -- she said this attack has left her concerned for children in the neighbourhood.

"Someone smaller wouldn't have made it, they could have been seriously injured, or killed."

[PO, from the article above] also said she's grateful the coyote attacked her, because a group of young children had ridden their bikes past the park shortly before the attack. "I'm glad it was me and not someone else."

Less than 10 kilometres [6.2 mi] northeast of Tuscany is the neighbourhood of Nolan Hill, where at least 3 people have been injured in coyote attacks in recent weeks.

A single, unusually aggressive animal was believed to be responsible for those attacks -- it was captured and killed by a city contractor on Tuesday evening [27 Jun 2021].

Both neighbourhoods are on the city's northwest outskirts -- bordering land yet to be developed.

Saturday's [26 Jun 2021] coyote attacks happened in the community of Tuscany, days after an aggressive coyote was put down in the community of Nolan Hill. The 2 neighbourhoods are less than 10 kilometres apart. [On the original article there is a map showing Tuscany and Nolan Hill. - Mod.TG]

The city of Calgary said parks contractors have conducted repeated coyote hazing in Tuscany following an increase in 311 requests about aggressive incidents. The same kind of hazing was done in Nolan Hill.

"The city supports and encourages peaceful co-existence with coyotes through public education and, if needed, proactive management," a city spokesperson said in an email.

The city said it will investigate the attacks, and "if it's proven the coyote's aggression is becoming an increasing risk to local residents, it will be permanently removed from the community as a last resort."

Urban coyotes do have benefits, like helping control the population of rodents and other wildlife and ensuring biodiversity.

The city said aggressive behaviour toward humans is typically rare, and so far this year [2021], the city has received 20 per cent fewer coyote calls to 311 than over the same period last year [2020].

The city suggests cleaning up any garbage or food sources in backyards, keeping pets on leashes, and keeping children in close sight in order to peacefully coexist with the animals.

Both victims spent the night in hospital awaiting treatment as there was only 1 rabies shot available -- they said it was given to the 3rd woman who was attacked, who was bitten on the back.

"I'm pretty sure it was the same [coyote]. But again, where there's one, are there others?" [HR] said. "They're getting more brazen ... that's a little bit scary too."

[While I applaud the efforts of the 2 towns wanting to live in harmony with wildlife, rabid animals are a danger to the community. Unprovoked bites are clearly an act of aggression and can be from rabies. Finding the aggressive animals, and having them tested for rabies is paramount for public safety. Yes, having the animal tested means its head must be sent to the appropriate lab for rabies testing.

Cleaning up garbage and not feeding wild animals are appropriate recommendations, but this situation should be of great concern for public safety. Furthermore, it seems appropriate to warn residents to have their pets vaccinated against rabies. This would include cats and dogs, horses, cattle, and sheep, and goats. Yes, some of these animals may be pets for local riding lessons, or livestock shows.

Thus far, according to these articles, there are at least 2 separate coyotes as well as 2 separate, but nearby towns. Yet the hospital only had one post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)! This seems like a public health nightmare could be brewing. If there are more animals testing positive for rabies, and insufficient PEP available, the outcome could become dire for these communities. - Mod.TG

A horse at a private facility in Volusia County, Florida, has tested positive for rabies and been euthanized, according to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. There is an official quarantine.

From 2000 to 2019, there have been 16 cases of equine rabies in Florida, according to Florida Health. The last year there was reported equine rabies in Florida was 2016, when there were 2 confirmed cases. In this 20-year time period, there were 2750 cases of animal rabies in the state of Florida, with the vast majority being in raccoons.

Some information for this report was supplied by the Equine Disease Communication Center (https://equinediseasecc.org/support-us)

[While we do not hear much about rabies in equines, it is very much, and unfortunately, a disease all horse owners and handlers should be aware of. The risk of a horse encountering rabies and being around human beings could have quite disastrous consequences for human beings. Horses can seriously injure a human in a frenzied state brought on by rabies. Also, these lovely animals usually represent quite an investment financially as well as a personal commitment, so protection for the animals, and ultimately their human caregivers, means it is paramount for equines to be vaccinated against rabies. - Mod.TG
