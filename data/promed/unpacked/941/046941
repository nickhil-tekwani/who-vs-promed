--------------------------------------------------------------
Taro breeders' lines were sent to Nigeria, Ghana, and later Cameroon following the outbreak of taro leaf blight in West Africa in 2010 [ProMED-mail post 20101216.4451]. These lines were from the very successful breeding program of Samoa and were sent from the tissue culture lab of the Pacific community, Fiji, through INEA, the International Network of Edible Aroids, supported by the European Union. The disease tolerance of these lines was the same in Nigeria as in the Pacific as their resistance is "horizontal,", that is, many-gene resistance or race-nonspecific and unlikely to breakdown.

The preferred taro variety in West Africa, and perhaps other parts, is the eddoe type, so it was hoped that the taro from Samoa (dasheen types) would be hybridised with local varieties. If this has been done, what is the result?

In the interim, it would have been useful to give the introductions to farmers to test; after all, the taste would have been similar to their traditional varieties, and, importantly, they could still grow taro and eat and process it. It would also be nice to know if this has been done and the result.

Finally, it is perhaps possible for true (botanical) seed to be generated in large amounts in Samoa from crosses between tolerant clones. The breeding program in Samoa is now in its 9th cycle. Introduction and screening seed together with farmers is a method that could and should be used where breeding is not possible for any reason.

[Our grateful thanks are due to Dr Jackson for these very interesting and valuable comments.

Taro leaf blight is caused by the oomycete _Phytophthora colocasiae_ (for more information see ProMED-mail post 20181008.6076838 and links below).

Cultivated taro, or dasheen, is classified as _Colocasia esculenta_ var. _esculenta_ (Cee; synonym _C. esculenta_). Most of the taro grown in the Asia/Pacific region is of the dasheen type. The species is considered to be polymorphic, and the term "eddoe" is used for other members of the genus such as _C. esculenta_ var. _antiquorum_ (Cea; synonym _C. antiquorum_), which has smaller, rounded corms that can be used in the same way as taro but may vary somewhat in taste of tubers and leaves. Colloquially, even aroids in related genera (such as _Xanthosoma_ species) are sometimes referred to as eddoes. There are hundreds of agronomic cultivars of both Cee and Cea worldwide optimised for particular local conditions and preferences.
