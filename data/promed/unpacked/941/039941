Bird lovers and officials are distressed as hummingbirds, robins, blue warblers, and others that spread joy with their voices and form the background noise of nature with their songs are being victimized by an unknown disease.

For the last month and a half [June-July 2021], a die-off from a mystery ailment has been sweeping across Indiana and while baffling and concerning scientists, not so different than what the world saw during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in humans in 2020.

This epidemic has produced dead songbirds in 69 of 92 Indiana counties as well as in other states, alarming bird experts and investigators as the toll continues to grow with no ability to pinpoint the root cause yet.

State ornithologist Allisyn-Marie Gillet said the count for dead and ill birds in Indiana was at 517. In early July [2021] the state had received reports of around 1000 sick or dying birds, but Gilet said those were broad-based and could have included incidents including vehicles, crashes into windows, or other causes.

Lately, the pace of reports has leveled off, she said, "neither decreasing or increasing." She did not characterize that as "good or bad."

Birds have died in the wild and at backyard feeders, but since the Indiana Department of Natural Resources alerted the public early in July [2021], the pace of the deaths has slowed, even though the geographical area has expanded. At the beginning of the month, dead birds had been discovered in 53 counties.

"The reports have diminished," Gillet said of the sheer number of cases brought to officials' attention in Indiana.

Indiana, 9 other states, and the District of Columbia have witnessed the songbird deaths, and federal, state, and private organizations are cooperating to learn the cause.

Step by step, Gillet said studies in various locations have ruled out West Nile virus, avian flu, salmonella, encephalitis, the chlamydia group of bacterial diseases, and more.

The disquieting elements are the spread of the infection through the Midwest and Atlantic states and the inability of experts to nail down a cause. Gillet said in that way, this bird disease is not unlike the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic's beginnings last year [2020].

Gillet said, as of now, "It's new and undefined. It's different."

Of course, even once identified, there is no way to vaccinate birds by the millions. "If only," she said.

While it is too soon to make a trending connection to the broad picture of North America's half-century decline in bird populations, something that can decimate select species is viewed as troublesome.

The Cornell University Laboratory of Ornithology, where some of the world's leading bird experts work, revealed a study in 2019 indicating the North American continent lost 3 billion birds over a 50-year period, a finding of decline that shocked experts.

Now, this. "We really don't need any more threats," said Brad Bumgardner, executive director of the Indiana Audubon Society. "There are certainly sad stories out there."

The 1st reports of sick and dead songbirds -- blue jays, cardinals, and robins among them -- reached Indiana DNR [Department of Natural Resources] in late May [2021].

Those discovered ill suffered from tremors, had liquid discharges in their eyes, swelling of the head, and disorientation. The 1st 12 samples were sent to a diagnostic lab for study.

Before the July 4 holiday, DNR issued a public alert about the situation and advice to cease feeding birds. Spring and summer are good seasons to move in this direction, Gillet said, at a time when birds do not need to rely on bread crumb gifts from good Samaritans.

"There are abundant food resources available to birds as alternates," Gillet said. In warm weather, they can thrive on nectar, insects, and seeds without human help. It was suggested if people came into contact with dead or sick birds to avoid touching them barehanded, to keep them away from pets, and to wash bird feeders with bleach.

In another parallel to the coronavirus pandemic, Gillet said a reason not to continue giving birds food at feeders is "to prevent birds from congregating." Essentially, a phrase that has become part of the common lexicon over the last year-plus, social distancing, is part of this prevention plan.

"We want birds to be able to socially distance naturally," Gillet said.

The DNR also added a program to its website enabling members of the public to provide information. A photograph of a bird is labeled with the words "Report a Sick Bird."

Bird watchers and others who participate in other outdoor activities were encouraged to let officials know if they saw dead birds. This was done in the hope it would help tracking of areas where they showed up or to help better understand why this is happening.

There have been major outbreaks of this mysterious plague affecting birds in places such as Ohio, Virginia, and elsewhere. The birds know no boundaries, so they do not know when they pass into Indiana or skirt a state boundary line.

"It's normal to have diseases that go through populations," Bumgardner said. But how deeply it affects species and if it lingers is always something to watch. "That's the main concern I have."

The DNR website tracking is a useful tool, Bumgardner said, but it is not all-encompassing. It represents a snapshot of what individuals (and bird watching members of the public are very active in such situations) tell state officials.

More birds will die in the forest, along streams, or elsewhere than the number of bodies found.

"It's a reporting tool," Bumgardner said. "Not everyone is going to be reported to that."

Monroe County, which includes Bloomington, has been a hot spot for bird deaths. Muscatatuck National Wildlife Refuge has not.

There, however, are no rules or guidelines about what might happen next. Some 279 different birds have been seen at Muscatatuck year-round, making it susceptible.

Calling it a good news situation, "We have not found any dead or dying songbirds at Muscatatuck," said park ranger Donna Stanley.

When the 2019 Cornell study was publicized, it was noted there had already been a decline in numbers among some groups of songbirds. The 3 billion overall bird population drop since 1970 jolted many people.

The key areas of diminishment were found among birds that frequent shorelines and grasslands but also among those common in boreal forests. Habitats change.

It was figured 2.5 billion of the bird losses originated in just 12 families of birds, popular and routinely seen, birds such as warblers, finches, larks, starlings, sparrows, and blackbirds. At the time, Pete Marra, a one-time Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center director said, "We want to keep common birds common, and we're not even doing that. There's general ecosystem collapse that could be happening here."

That's what scares bird people. It is difficult enough to count birds, which do not stay still and do not come into the ranch corral for roundups.

Radar was employed to conduct the study over time. Although the average citizen is probably most familiar with radar in military and weather terms, bird experts use radar to see flocks.

"We don't see individual birds. It's more like a big blob moving through air space," said Cornell expert Adriaan Dokter.

The study was able to discern that the size of the blobs, as the birds migrated, was shrinking.

That is all big-picture stuff, indeed giant picture stuff, such as the future of specific species, compared to this bewildering bird disease.

What has ignited worry and prodded agencies like Indiana's DNR, other states, and federal agencies is that this inexplicable contagion might be something that balloons into part of the giant picture stuff.

It has been years since Indiana birds have been infected with such an ominous threat. Gillet and Bumgardner made comparisons to West Nile Virus dating to 2004. At that time, Indiana was one of 40 states where birds were afflicted with West Nile, which is transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito.

"The last (such widespread similar disease) that I would say is West Nile," Bumgardner said. "It's the best example we've had in recent times."

So far, one of the things the bird experts know is that this time around the illness is not West Nile, which dropped to 4 total cases reported in 2020.

Aware his comment sounded cryptic, though given the recent coronavirus history, knowing it would resonate with laymen, he said, "It's bird COVID, right?"

It might be anything at all at this point, Gillet said the other day. Thus far, state and federal agencies have only eliminated possibilities.

"Running it out is part of the process," she said. "It takes time. It took 4 months to identify COVID. We have been dealing with this for only 1.5 months. It's important to emphasize these things take time."

Hoosiers [resident of Indiana] want to help with their reports to the DNR website. They also are upset the dying birds are in many cases the ones most familiar to them that fill the sky with music.

"They absolutely are (worried)," Gillet said. "People have a lot of emotion invested in them."

People are attached to the songs they hear and the colors they see when the wings of hummingbirds, cardinals, and robins flutter.

[In the last few decades, we have witnessed several emerging transmissible diseases in wildlife, some of which with catastrophic consequences, such as the Tasmanian devil facial tumor, amphibian chytridiomycosis, and white nose syndrome. This one appears to be a new syndrome and it warrants profound research efforts. New diseases emerge for multiple causes, which usually interact in a complex way. The environment might change causing new stressors to emerge, pathogens might be favored by some of those changes, and hosts might become more susceptible due to greater exposure, or less resistance or tolerance. There is a need for producing, analyzing, and integrating information that helps us construct the web of causation underlying this new disease. Only then we will be prepared to anticipate, prevent, control, or mitigate its impact. - Mod.PMB
