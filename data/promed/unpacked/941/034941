Polio outbreak reported in southern Madagascar
----------------------------------------------
The Malagasy government and its UN partners are to launch a door-to door
immunisation campaign after 2 cases of polio were reported in southern
Madagascar in the last few weeks.
Oliver Rosenbauer, a spokesman for the polio eradication initiative of the
World Health Organisation (WHO), confirmed that the cases were "vaccine-
derived" and had been contracted from the weak live polio virus in the oral
vaccine given to children. "These cases are very rare," he pointed out.
The Ministry of Health, WHO and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) have
intensified medical surveillance in the southern province of Toliara and
neighbouring districts. "We will be conducting a door-to-door campaign in 27
districts," said Barbara Bentein, UNICEF's resident representative.
"Madagascar was going to qualify for polio-free status," she commented. The
last polio outbreak in Madagascar was reported in 2002 [see ref. below. -
Mod.JW].
At an inter-agency coordinating committee meeting earlier this week, the
government and its UN partners decided to hold national immunisation days in
the next 2 months, covering at least 600 000 children aged under 5 in Toliara's
21 districts as well as 6 other districts bordering the province.
5 cases of acute flaccid paralysis, "associated with strains of polio virus
derived from oral polio vaccine", were reported in southern Madagascar in
2001/02, according to the L'Institut Pasteur in Paris.
Although no case of the disease due to a wild polio virus has been detected in
Madagascar since 1997, L'Institut Pasteur researchers said those associated
with the virus derived from the oral vaccine made eradication "more complex",
and had an implication for vaccination campaigns.
Rosenbauer said because of the possible -- though remote -- threat of
contracting polio from the vaccine, it was WHO's policy that "eventually all
polio vaccines will be stopped, once the disease has been eradicated".

[In the original newswire posted by IRIN on 14 Jul 2005, there was mention of
one case of polio. This has subsequently been modified to 2 cases of polio in
the southern province. According to the polio eradication website
<http://www.who.int/vaccines/casecount/afpextractnew.cfm>
as of 15 Jul 2005 there was one confirmed case of vaccine derived poliovirus
(VDPV) infection in Madagascar.
In 2001/2002 there were 4 cases of VDPV infection (with paralysis) reported in
Madagascar (see reference below). At that time, the virus responsible was
identified as a type 2 VDPV. Neither the above newswire, nor the polio
eradication website mention the serotype of the VDPV responsible for these
cases (one or 2 cases?). It would be of interest to know if the responsible
virus this year is genetically related to the one that caused the cluster of
cases in 2001/2002, suggesting continued low-level circulation of the same
virus, or if this was a new episode of reversion to neurovirulence.
Borrowing from prior moderator comments on VDPV clusters: This is now the 5th
documented occurrence of paralytic polio associated with circulation of a
vaccine-derived virus (VDPV) with reversion to neurovirulence. Prior instances
were in Madagascar (type-2), Egypt (type-2), the Philippines (type-1), the
Dominican Republic and Haiti (type-1) (see referenced ProMED-mail articles
below).
On reflection, this moderator has not abandoned the views expressed in the
commentary contained in the ProMED-mail posting on circulating vaccine-derived
poliovirus cases (cVDPV) in the Philippines (Poliomyelitis, vaccine-derived -
Philippines: 2001 20011013.2506), and therefore I am borrowing from that
posting to repeat here.
One wonders if this is a case of "seek and ye shall find," or if this is an
emerging problem associated with the vaccine. The former seemed to have been
preliminarily ruled out by the failure of a retrospective study of over 2000
AFP-associated poliovirus isolates (performed in the Philippines) to identify
additional VDPV. If it is truly a low-level occurrence, it may have been
missed. If this is an emerging problem, one wonders why now, after
approximately 50 years of vaccine use, we are seeing this phenomenon. If one
chooses to adjust the date to the implementation of increased vaccination
activities associated with the polio eradication effort, the time frame for
widespread use is approximately 20 years, when polio eradication activities in
the Americas region began. At the risk of provoking our readers, this
moderator wonders whether the increased prevalence of HIV infection might be
associated with this observed phenomenon. There are now greater numbers of
immune-compromised infants who may have been exposed to the live virus, with
resultant chronic infections postulated to predispose to neurovirulence
reversion.
This phenomenon has now occurred (or better stated, "been documented") in 4
different regions of the world: the Middle East (Egypt and Israel), the
Americas (Hispaniola, i.e. Haiti & the Dominican Republic), the Western Pacific
(Philippines), and now Africa (Madagascar). In 2 of the regions (Hispaniola
and the Philippines) circulation of the wild poliovirus had been interrupted
(the last reported case of wild poliovirus-associated disease in the Americas
was in 1991 and in the Philippines in 1993). In Madagascar, the last
documented case of wild poliovirus circulation was in 1997. In all 4 prior
cases, this occurred in pockets of unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated
individuals (we do not have this information about the current case(s) in
Madagascar but one might assume this is the case). There was also a case
report of a VDPV type-1 paralytic case in Russia (see ref 1) in 1999.
In the absence of total interruption of wild poliovirus circulation worldwide,
there is still a need for intensified vaccination efforts. The risk of disease
is still present, especially in today's environment with extensive world
travel. The occurrence of VDPV in association with clinical disease is very
disturbing, as it adds another factor to the risk/benefit equation of
vaccination recommendations. As mentioned in an earlier comment, a cost-
efficacy analysis of switching to the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in
countries that have interrupted wild virus circulation [suggests that they
cannot afford it]. Significantly, a switch to IPV would remove the advantage of
flooding the environment with the vaccine virus (the attenuated very-low-
neurovirulence virus) to further interrupt transmission of wild poliovirus if
introduced, as well as to "vaccinate" individuals who may not have directly
taken the vaccine themselves.
