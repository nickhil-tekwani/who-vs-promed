[There is still no determination of the etiological agent responsible
for the acute encephalitis cases. Mod.EP pointed out that a previous
comment stated, "Encephalitis of enterovirus etiology has occurred
previously in this area, as reported in the following reference:
Sapkal GN, Bondre VP, Fulmali PV, Patil P, Gopalkrishna V, Dadhania
V, et al. 2009: Enteroviruses in patients with acute encephalitis,
Uttar Pradesh, India. Emerg Infect Dis. 15: 295-8 (full article
available at <http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/15/2/pdfs/08-0865.pdf>).
JE has a clear seasonal variation and the present outbreak has been
going on since January this year (2009) and is increasing at a time
of the year when JE used to decrease (usual season May-October). With
the study above in mind perhaps we should more clearly ask for more
information on other viruses such as the enteroviruses found in the
study above." - Mod.TY]

[The case fatality rate of nearly 20 percent is bad enough, but it
can go up to 30 percent for JE. Are they not vaccinating in UP? - Mod.JW]

[What about those who do not die? This must be costing India a small
fortune, much more than the vaccine would cost. - Charles Calisher
