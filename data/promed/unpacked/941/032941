[There was a report of cases of encephalitis and encephalopathy
following infection with the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in the USA
earlier this year [2009]. The MMWR editorial note mentioned the
following: "Neurologic complications in children associated with
seasonal influenza have included acute cognitive and behavioral
problems, focal neurologic deficits, and death from neurologic
complications (4). Influenza-associated neurologic complications are
estimated to account for up to 5 percent of cases of acute childhood
encephalitis or encephalopathy (4) and were reported in 6 percent of
influenza-associated deaths among children during one influenza
season (2003-04) in the United States (5). The epidemiology of
influenza-associated encephalopathy has been described extensively in
Japan, where incidence has appeared to be higher than in other
countries (1). In Japan, approximately 80 percent of
influenza-associated encephalopathy cases occur in children aged less
than 5 years (1,6), and neurologic signs typically develop within 1-2
days of influenza symptom onset (1,6). Manifestations have included
seizures, altered consciousness, incoherence, irritability, and
psychotic behaviors (1,6). Outcomes reported in one case-series from
Japan ranged from complete resolution (in nearly 50 percent of
cases), to mild (20 percent) or severe neurologic sequelae (10
percent), to death (20 percent) (6). (See: Neurologic Complications
Associated with Novel Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Infection in Children

[Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) typically affects young,
healthy children who develop rapid-onset severe encephalopathy
triggered by viral infections. This disease is more commonly reported
in Japan but occurs worldwide, although it remains under-recognized
in Western countries. (For description of a genetic component in the
condition, see: Im Dev Med Child Neurol. 2009 Oct 7, Gika AD, Rich P,
