Protecting rabbits from new disease discovered on Maui
------------------------------------------------------
In June [2022], the Hawaii Department of Agriculture (DOA) alerted the public tissues submitted by a practicing Maui veterinarian tested positive for rabbit hemorrhagic disease. The owner had a farm in Kula, and DOA determined 9 of the 12 of their rabbits had died fairly suddenly without showing significant prior signs of illness. Only recently found in the United States, RHDV2 is a virus found in hares and rabbits causing internal bleeding and death. The Maui detection marked the 1st known case of this disease in Hawaii.

A New Mexico-based wildlife biologist encountered wild rabbit carcasses in 2018 while walking his dog in the desert. He sent samples the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed as the country's 1st case of rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHDV2). The virus later caused outbreaks in 2020 for both wild and domesticated rabbits throughout 19 states. In response, DOA ramped up biosecurity efforts to prevent infected rabbits from arriving to our islands.

Dr. Jason Moniz is the veterinarian program manager with DOA's Animal Industry Division, Animal Disease Control Branch.

"Since the 2020 outbreak of RHDV2, importers of rabbits are required to have a veterinarian examine and issue a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection within 72 hours before departure to ensure they are healthy and have not been exposed to RHDV2," Moniz said.

Upon arrival in Hawaii, inspectors check the animal again before releasing it to the owner. Finally, owners are required to quarantine the rabbit for 30 days before introducing it to other rabbits.

Inspectors do follow-up calls with imports 7 days after arrival to ensure the rabbits remain healthy. This strict process also provides DOA with records on 100% of the rabbits coming into Hawaii. If there is a disease outbreak, they have the records to trace the potential origin.

With this recent case, DOA couldn't find a link between any introduced rabbits and those on the Kula farm.

"It's like this dropped out of the sky," Moniz stated. However, he has suspicions about how the virus may have arrived. "RHDV2 is an incredibly hardy virus, able to survive not only on rabbits, but on people and inanimate objects for up to 3 months," he explained.

Even wearing an unwashed piece of clothing after coming in contact with sick rabbits could trigger an outbreak months later if it comes into contact with healthy ones. Moniz also has concerns about the potential for feed to be contaminated if harvested from areas where RHDV2 is present.

Good sanitation and biosecurity practices are essential for protecting rabbits, and the same general practices apply when introducing any new animal (or plant) to protect Hawaii from new invasive pests. DOA recommends the following:

• Keep new rabbits and other animals separated for at least 30 days. Dogs, cats and other imported animals are not at risk for RHVD2, but the virus can hitchhike on their fur and spread to healthy rabbits.
• Sanitize all equipment and cages used for rabbits with 10% bleach or 10% sodium hydroxide mixed with water.
• Do not allow visitors in rabbitries or let them handle pet rabbits without clean, protective clothing. If a visitor was recently in a state having an outbreak of RHVD2, ensure they decontaminate any items they traveled with before coming into contact with your rabbit.
• Always wash hands with warm soapy water before and after entering your rabbit area.

There are currently no wild rabbit populations in the state. If there were, a disease like RHDV2 would be impossible to eradicate. Additionally, wild rabbits can cause environmental damage. In the early 1900s, wild rabbits on Kauo (Laysan) island ate all the vegetation, causing the extinction of native seabirds which lost their habitat. Hawaii state law requires pet owners to contain their rabbits above ground under penalty of fines, loss of the pet or even imprisonment. Rabbits, well, will breed like rabbits; spay or neuter them in case of accidental escape.

Owners or veterinarians experiencing unusual losses of rabbits should contact the DOA's Animal Industry Division.

Report rabbits in wild areas to the Maui Invasive Species Committee.

["Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV) is a highly contagious disease caused by a calicivirus that affects rabbits. This includes wild and domesticated European rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_), from which our own domesticated rabbits are descended. Until 2020, it had not been known to affect North American native rabbits or hares, such as cottontails, snowshoe hares, and jackrabbits. In the 2020-2021 United States and Mexico and Canada outbreak, RHDV caused death in wildlife species of rabbits as well.

"RHDV was 1st seen in China in 1984 but was thought to have originated in Europe. There have been confirmed cases in 40 countries, including in Europe, the Mediterranean, Africa, Asia, North America (Mexico, United States, Canada), Australia, and New Zealand.

"RHDV2, a new virus, emerged in France in 2010, and quickly spread in Europe and the Mediterranean, and has replaced the original strain in many countries. In 2015, RHDV2 was first detected in Australia -- it spread coast-to-coast in the rabbit population in 18 months (approximately 3 million square miles, compared to United States' approximately 3.8 million square miles) and became the dominant strain replacing RHDV1.

"Signs may include:
- Loss of appetite
- Lethargy
- High fever
- Seizures
- Jaundice
- Bleeding from nose, mouth, or rectum
- Difficulty breathing
- Sudden death

"RHDV is often a very swift and sudden killer, giving little warning. Rabbits may die without showing any symptoms at all. Any sudden rabbit death is suspicious and should be reported to your veterinarian as a possible case of RHDV.

"Incubation period
- RHDV1 1-3 days. Rabbits may die within 12-36 hours to a few weeks, after the onset of symptoms.
- RHDV2 3-5 days. Previous experimental RHDV2 infection found incubation of 3-9 days until onset of symptoms, then death within 3-5 days.

"Death rate (mortality)
- RHDV1 40-100%
- RHDV2 5-80%+. In the 2020 Southwest US and Mexico RHDV2 outbreak, officials report a death rate of about 90%.

"Survivors
Rabbits who survive RHDV are carriers and shed the virus for at least 42 days, perhaps longer.

"Asymptomatic carriers
Some rabbits may have little to no signs of RHDV2 (subclinical/asymptomatic) but may shed virus for up to 2 months.

"Transmission routes
Rabbits are infected by oral, nasal/respiratory, or ocular exposure to the virus, or by blood-feeding insects.
- Cause of death: RHDV causes necrotizing hepatitis, and may cause necrosis of the spleen. There may be internal or externally visible bleeding. Death occurs from liver failure or hemorrhage due to an impairment in the blood's ability to clot.

"Durability of virus
Rabbit calicivirus is a very hardy virus, remaining viable in the environment outside a host.
- Survives 105 days at 68 degrees F (20 deg C) on fabric - it remains stable for 3.5 months at room temperature
- Survives 225 days at 39 degrees F (3.9 deg C) (just above freezing temperatures)
- Survives freeze/thaw cycles
- Survives heat of 122 degrees F (50 deg C) for one hour

"Seasonal outbreaks
Where the virus has a reservoir in wild rabbits or feral/stray domestic rabbits, seasonal outbreaks are expected year to year. In Australia, outbreaks start in fall and winter, peak in spring, and are mostly absent in summer. Seasonal fly abundance, as flies are a significant vector, may be linked with RHDV activity.

"Treatment
- There is no known cure for RHDV
- RHDV treatment is supportive care in isolation
- There are currently no known effective anti-viral drugs or other treatments available"
