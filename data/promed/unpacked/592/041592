A cattle disease, affecting mainly cows, caused by the lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), has been reported recently in the press, electronic and social media. The disease has been reported in farms at Sanghar, Jamshoro, Thatta, Sukkur, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Khairpur and Karachi, according to a communique. There are reports of loss of weight and milk production in animals due to the disease.

The origin of the disease is Africa, from where it has spread to middle East, Asia and Eastern Europe. Within the region, in recent years there were reports of outbreaks of this disease in Iran, India and some other regional countries.

This is a new animal disease in Pakistan, and there is no treatment, medicine or vaccine [see comment] available for it so far. It is transmitted by insects feeding on blood such as certain species of flies and mosquitoes, or ticks. It causes fever, nodules on the skin and can lead to death, though mortality rate has been found less than 5%.

The Sindh government and fisheries department have advised the owners of cattle to separate their sick animals from healthy ones, keep sheds clean, prevent animals from mosquitoes and biting insects, use mosquito nets, frequently spray farms, animals and premises with anti-insect sprays. In case of disease, report to local authorities and livestock department.

Humans are not at risk of developing LSD. It is an [infectious] disease in animals.

Although there is no treatment for LSD, non-specific treatment such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs and vitamin injections are usually advised by the authorized veterinary doctors as a secondary treatment.

It has been observed that consumption of meat and milk from LSDV-affected animals is not dangerous to human health.

In need for any advice at the local level, the offices of Additional Director Livestock at each district may be consulted. The office addresses and phone numbers are available on the webpage of the department of Livestock and Fisheries. An additional helpline is being established in the office of Director Animal Husbandry Hyderabad and Deputy Director Livestock Animal Husbandry Karachi.

[ProMED thanks Dr Muhammad Usman Zaheer and Mahmoud Orabi for their submissions.

The clinical diagnosis of LSD in cattle, particularly in susceptible breeds, is sufficient for the application of immediate control measures to prevent its spread. Contrary to the media report, a (live attenuated) vaccine is available and efficient. Once the disease has a foothold in a country, the most effective way to control it is by mass vaccination of cattle.

LSD, a capripox viral OIE-listed disease originally affecting cattle across Africa with sporadic introductions into neighboring Middle Eastern countries, has spread since 2013 outside the continent with epizootics in Balkan countries, trans-Ural Russia, and throughout Asia. It has already been reported from the following Asian/South-East Asian countries: Bangladesh, India, China, Bhutan, Nepal, Viet Nam, Taiwan, Myanmar, China (Hong Kong SAR), Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Laos, and Mongolia. Very recently, Indonesia has been added to the list (OIE report at https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=49767).

Its laboratory confirmation in Pakistan and official reporting to the OIE are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
