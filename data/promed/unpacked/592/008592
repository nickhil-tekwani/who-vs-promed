Summary
-------
Between 1979 and 2000, foxes constituted the main reservoir of rabies
in the Northern regions of Israel. Following the implementation of
the fox-targeted oral vaccination programme (ORV) in 1998, rabies was
eradicated from this area. Subsequently during 2004-2007, the
biological and molecular characterization of the rabies isolates
showed that stray dogs emerged as the main animal reservoir in
Northern Israel while lower numbers of cases were reported in
domestic animals. The virus isolates from foxes and dogs differed, in
their molecular characterization, suggesting 2 distinct separate
lineages. The transition from fox-mediated rabies to dog-mediated
rabies is of great concern to public health because of the close
contact between dogs and the human population.

[Rabies, which is mainly transmitted by dogs is generally known by the
term "urbanic," compared to rabies characterised by wildlife
reservoirs, generally termed "sylvatic."

The development described in the paper above by Israeli and Turkish
authors, is of significance to other countries with sylvatic rabies,
applying ORV in wildlife, while their neighbours (which may have also
"urbanic" rabies) don't. The following discussion, copied from the
full paper (for which subscription is required), may be of interest
to subscribers:

"Several hypotheses can serve to explain the rabies outbreak
emergence in Northern Israel and are listed as follows:
1. Penetration of infected stray dogs into Northern Israel across the
borders. In Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan rabies is principally
a disease of domestic dogs, with occasional cases observed in
domestic cattle, wild animals and humans. Between 1995 and 2002, 14
human cases were reported in Lebanon and a dog bite was identified as
the source of exposure in the majority. Identification of a rabid
stone marten isolate (S19655) provided evidence of rabies virus
circulating in wild animals in Southern Lebanon during 1997.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that this isolate belonged to variant
IC. Between 1997 and 2002, 24 fatal human case of rabies occurred in
Syria. Phylogenetic analysis provides support that variant VII,
responsible for these cases in dogs, was recently introduced to the
area and had not originated in Israel. Our hypothesis is that rabies
outbreaks in stray dogs and foxes occurred in neighbouring countries
and were the result of penetration of infected animals into the
Northern regions of Israel.

2. Translocation of infected stray dogs by humans travelling into and
out of the Golan Heights. Based on epidemiological investigations, 2
cases might have been caused by translocation of dogs from the Golan
Heights to the Upper Galilee region. The 1st case was a dog,
translocated to Hatzor Haglilit, while the 2nd case was a cow, found
positive in the Galilee region, far removed from the border area that
might have been infected by the translocation of an infected dog from
the Golan Heights to this area during its incubation period. We
recently described the tracing of the regional source of a rabies
infection in an Israeli stray dog using molecular and antigenic
characterization to show that the dog had been moved from the south
to the centre of Israel.

3. Difference in the efficacies of the fishmeal polymer bait Raboral
V-RG vaccine in 2 rabies animal reservoirs. Although the bait was
taken and induced protection in wildlife foxes, it was not effective
in dogs. The V-RG vaccine was only efficient in dogs when it was
administered directly by mouth. It appears that the mode of delivery
of the vaccine influences the acceptance of baits by dogs.

Recently, the vaccination efficacy of livestock guard dogs by means
of the fishmeal polymer bait Raboral V-RG vaccine was tested in the
Golan Heights, however, the success of the procedure was limited;
only 28 percent of the dogs consumed the baits, similar to previous
studies conducted in Tunisia and Egypt. In those studies artificial
fishmeal-containing candidate baits for delivery of oral rabies
vaccines were poorly accepted by dogs. However, baits made from local
material were found to have considerable advantages over imported
manufactured baits. It seems that the ecological aspect of the bait
content is important for the eradication of the rabies reservoirs
formed by various wild animals."

and South Lebanese rabies virus isolates.
