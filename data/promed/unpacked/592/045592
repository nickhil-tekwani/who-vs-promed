EUROPE COULD FACE 'DEVASTATING' OUTBREAKS OF ANIMAL DISEASES

Europe faces "devastating" animal disease epidemics in the future and should
alter its strategy for containing them, the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization warned Tuesday. The agency has called for a cut in
herd concentrations, an increase in border controls, and the development of
animal identification systems.
  
It also suggested the private sector be obliged to take on some of the costs
of containing diseases and warned governments that the privatization and
decentralization of national veterinary services could reduce their
effectiveness.
  
The agency's recommendations are aimed at containing fast spreading diseases
such as swine fever and foot and mouth disease, rather than the BSE "mad
cow" disease, which develops more slowly.
Europe has suffered more epidemics than any other region. Nine of the 15
major epidemic livestock diseases recorded internationally have occurred in
Europe. The FAO blames dense populations of livestock and an increase in
long-distance animal transportation as trade increases. Both trends
stimulate the rapid spread of disease.
  
Farms in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany concentrate up to 3,600 pigs
per square mile of land.[There are similarly pig-dense areas in the
Carolinas and for cattle near El Paso to take only two US examples.] "This
causes increasing pollution and should not be tolerated any more," said Yves
Leforban, FAO health officer.
  
The Netherlands, affected last year by a costly outbreak of swine fever, and
Denmark are among countries already taking steps to cut animal densities.
Eastern European countries are less of a problem because farming is less
intensive there.
  
In a report Tuesday the FAO challenged the practice by which the public
sector in Europe bears the cost of epidemics and compensates the private
sector for losses incurred. It argued this did little to encourage sanitary
methods. "Industry does not appear to be able to discipline itself and it
may be that government compensation instills false security."
  
The FAO suggests a compulsory insurance program for livestock owners to
protect against the costs of disease. It said certification and
identification of animals were essential for their safe movement.
