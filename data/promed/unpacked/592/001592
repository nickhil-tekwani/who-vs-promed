The New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) Director General has issued a statement warning of a potential risk associated with imported frozen berries following 4 human cases of hepatitis A thought to be linked to packaged imported frozen berries.

"Australian officials recalled important frozen berries there in February [2015]. Recent outbreaks in other countries also suggest this link," he said.

The Ministry has instituted a surveillance program, including additional testing, focused on imported frozen berries. The ministry said fresh berries or products containing frozen berries had not been implicated in its investigation.

"We are giving a very high priority to instigating a testing program that will provide increased surveillance of imported frozen berries. This will include previously imported stocks held by food companies here." Nathan Guy must explain why -- when there is a joint Australasian approach to food safety -- the same wasn't done here. He said anyone concerned about the safety of their frozen berries should briefly boil them before eating. The disease is spread through contact with feces of an infected person, such as through failure of an infected food handler to wash hands properly after using the toilet.

The recall of Fruzio frozen berries has been extended to cover 1 kg bags of strawberries, blackberries and mixed berries. The additional voluntary recall was announced on Fri 4 Dec 2015 after Fruzio's 1 kg and 500 gram mixed berry bags, which contain strawberries and blackberries, were recalled on Thu 3 Dec 2015.

The products have been connected with a potential risk of hepatitis A. The Ministry for Primary Industries said all other imported frozen berries should still be briefly boiled before being eaten. Berries could also be cooked at 85 C [185 F] or higher for one minute.

Anyone who had the Fruzio products at home should throw them out, MPI director of plants food and environment Peter Thomson said. "Elderly persons and those with chronic liver damage should [especially] avoid imported frozen berries that have not been heat treated."

FSL Foods markets the Fruzio products. The company's owner Mike Glover said the incident was devastating for the company. The company, which also supplies juice, fruit and flour-based products, had robust systems in place and worked with suppliers who sold internationally. He said the product had come from 2 Chinese provinces where 125 000 metric tons of fruit was produced each year and that the contaminated berries were sourced from Chinese provinces Shandong and Jiangsu. He also said the Chinese producers he dealt with had the highest food safety certificate and tested random samples of their fruit for hepatitis A.

Fruzio would continue their distribution of blueberries, mangos and cherries because they were not sourced from China, he said.

[The following was extracted from ProMED post Hepatitis A - Italy: frozen berries 20140919.2784633 containing a Eurosurveilence report on the outbreak of hepatitis associated with frozen berries in Europe (Eurosurveillance Edition 2014, 19(37),
http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20906), with the citations within the report removed:

"Consumption of fresh or frozen produce is known to be associated with outbreaks of foodborne enteric viruses, particularly norovirus and HAV. Produce (fruits and vegetables) can become contaminated during cultivation prior to harvest due to contact with inadequately treated sewage or sewage-polluted water, or fomites. Contamination may also occur by infected food handlers, during harvesting, processing, storage, distribution, or final preparation, with the virus likely to be found on the surface of the food. Fruits and vegetables are more prone to being vehicles of food-borne infections, as they are more likely to be left uncooked before consumption. Berries as a vehicle for transmission of HAV have been described in several outbreaks, with most of the infections connected to consumption of minimally processed frozen berries.

"Furthermore, it has been shown that among berries (frozen raspberries in particular) and vegetables (that is, parsley), those with uneven shapes are more likely to retain viruses on their surface. Raspberries, for example, have crevices and hair-like projections which may prevent the virus from being removed by rinsing.

"Recently, outbreaks connected to berry consumption have been reported in some Nordic European countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden) and in the United States. The outbreak in Nordic countries was associated with frozen strawberries, while the outbreak in the United States was associated with Townsend Farms Organic Antioxidant Blend, a frozen blend containing a pomegranate seed mix. However, the virus genotype 1A isolated in a 2014 Italian outbreak was different from the virus genotypes implicated in the abovementioned recent outbreaks (genotype 1B), which also have frozen strawberries and berries as the suspected vehicles." - Mod.LL
