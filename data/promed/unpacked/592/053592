CHANGE IN DISEASE STATUS OF LIECHTENSTEIN BECAUSE OF BSE
AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.
ACTION: Interim rule and request for comments.
SUMMARY: We are amending the regulations by adding Liechtenstein to the
list of regions where bovine spongiform encephalopathy exists because the
disease has been detected in two bovine animals in that region. The effect
of this action is to prohibit or restrict the importation of ruminants that
have been in Liechtenstein and meat, meat products, and certain other
edible products of ruminants that have been in Liechtenstein. This action
is necessary to reduce the risk that bovine spongiform encephalopathy could
be introduced into the United States.
DATES: Interim rule effective December 18, 1998. Consideration will be
given only to comments received on or before February 22, 1999. ADDRESSES:
Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Docket No.
98-119-1, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, Suite 3C03, 4700
River Road Unit 118, Riverdale, MD 20737-1238. Please state that your
comments refer to Docket No. 98-119-1. Comments received may be inspected
at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue
SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday,
except holidays. Persons wishing to inspect comments are requested to call
ahead on (202) 690-2817 to facilitate entry into the comment reading room.
