UN worker with Ebola arrives in France for treatment
----------------------------------------------------
France is treating a UN employee who contracted Ebola while working with those infected in Sierra Leone, the French health ministry said on Sunday [2 Nov 2014]. The victim is in an isolation unit under high security at an army training hospital in Saint-Mande. France has 12 research hospitals ready to take in suspected Ebola cases. "The UN employee, who worked in Sierra Leone in the fight against Ebola, has undergone a secure medical evacuation by specialised aircraft," the French health ministry said in a statement.

A French nurse, who worked for Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Liberia, was treated for Ebola at the same hospital in September [2014] and subsequently recovered.

Despite around 500 reports of [suspected] Ebola infections in France since June [2014], not one person has so far tested positive, the ministry said ... -- more

[2] Canada suspends visas for West Africa states

Ebola crisis: Canada suspends visas for West Africa states
----------------------------------------------------------
Canada is to suspend visa applications from residents and passport-holders from West African countries in the grip of the Ebola outbreak. The decision follows a similar decision by Australia, which drew criticism from the World Health Organization (WHO). The ban would apply to countries with "widespread and persistent-intense transmission", Canada said. Although Canada currently has no cases of Ebola, the country's federal citizenship ministry said "the introduction or spread of the disease would pose an imminent and severe risk to public health". A government spokesman said the move was less restrictive than Australia's plan, with the ability to grant visas on a case-by-case basis retained. The ban would also not apply to Canadians travelling from the Ebola zone -- allowing health workers and volunteers to return home....

WHO opposes travel bans
-----------------------
The WHO opposes travel bans as a method of containing Ebola. David Fidler, a professor at Indiana University in the USA, told Canadian media that the government's move undermined international regulations drawn up after the SARS outbreak of 2003. "The whole thing that so many years and so many efforts and so much money was spent on just seems to be disintegrating in this Ebola panic," he told CBC News ... -- more

[3] North Korea: quarantine measures

In North Korea, fear takes hold over new foreign threat: Ebola
--------------------------------------------------------------
World's toughest measures against the disease have been imposed in a country far from west Africa, and with few tourists ...

The country announced it was banning all tour groups on 23 Oct [2014]. It also began refusing entry to citizens of countries that had had Ebola cases: a Beijing-based Spanish cameraman was told he could not make a scheduled trip; 2 individuals from African countries -- both far from the outbreak zone -- were ordered into quarantine after arrival in Pyongyang, though one has since been allowed to leave. An unknown number of North Korean citizens who have returned from abroad have also been quarantined, although it is not clear if the measure applies to all countries or specific ones. North Korea has diplomatic ties with Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone....

On Thursday [30 Oct 2014] the country tightened measures further, announcing that all foreigners entering the country would have to undergo a 3-week quarantine period. Foreign visitors who entered in the days before the quarantine announcement were told that daily temperature checks were compulsory....

Associated Press said on Friday [31 Oct 2014] that Chinese businesspeople on the border had said they were unaffected and China's state news agency, Xinhua, reported that no Chinese nationals had been quarantined. Already, officials have said that diplomats and the staff of international organisations -- who have to make regular trips to Beijing for cash and other supplies because of sanctions -- can serve their quarantine at home rather than at designated quarantine hotels ... -- more

[4] Suspected cases ex Africa

Viet Nam ex Guinea suspected
----------------------------
1 Nov 2014: (Tuoi Tre News) A Vietnamese man who arrived from Guinea 5 days ago is suspected of having Ebola after showing a high fever and was quarantined in a hospital in central Vietnam's Da Nang City on Saturday [1 Nov 2014] ... -- more

[NB: We are not posting any more suspected imported Ebola cases on ProMED because they have all been false alarms so far and only serve to put people off traveling "just in case the suspected Ebola case is confirmed." Travelers to countries that only have suspected cases are extremely unlikely to come into skin contact with anybody actually showing symptoms of Ebola infection. - Mod.JW]
