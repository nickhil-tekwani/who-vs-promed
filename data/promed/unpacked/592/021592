Alberta Beef Producers say it's conceivable the source of the bovine tuberculosis outbreak in the area will never be found.

The industry has been managing with the outbreak for nearly a year, which began with 6 infected animals on an Alberta farm and brought about 10 000 dairy cattle being ruined.

No new cases have been found past the 1st 6 [animals].

Karin Schmid with Alberta Beef Producers says the following period of the examination includes testing animals acquainted with the index herd in the course of the most recent 5 years.

"It is a necessary step in these investigations just to make sure we've covered all our bases and can show to our trading partners and the international community that we're doing our due diligence," she said.

Follow in cows [presumably those cows coming into the herd after infected were removed. - Mod.TG] are the most minimal risk classification, so there are no limitations on the movement or sale of the animals.

Around 80 follow in herds are foreseen to be tested, which is less than initially expected.

[There are 2 very sad things that leap out of this article: 1) so many animals have been terminated, and herd genetics lost and producers may be hurting as well, 2) after all the animal loss and human grief, the source remains undetermined.

Hopefully this tragedy will not be repeated, despite not finding the source. - Mod.TG
