The Health and Family Planning Commission of Guangdong Province reported [Sat 18 Jun 2016] on a human case of H9N2 avian influenza in a child, according to a China News report (computer translated).

The case, a 4-year-old girl, is from Xingning City, Meizhou. She is currently in serious condition at a Meizhou hospital.

The Guangdong CDC believes she contracted the virus from poultry. Guangdong CDC experts have warned that the public should remain vigilant, as far as possible to avoid live bird markets and not to buy products of unknown origin of birds.

Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Human cases infected with avian influenza A (such as, H5N1, H5N6, H6N1, H7N9, H9N2, and H10N8) viruses have been identified in recent years.

[H9N2 is the most common subtype of influenza virus in chickens in China. It also causes a great economic loss for the poultry industry, even under the long-term vaccination programs.

Recent human infections with avian inï¬‚uenza virus have revealed that H9N2 are the donors for internal genes to H5N1, H7N9, and H10N8 viruses that have successfully infected humans. The crucial role of H9N2 viruses at the animal-human interface is due to the wide host range, adaptation to both poultry and mammals, and extensive gene reassortment.

In China, which is regarded as an epicenter of avian influenza viruses, the H9N2 virus has been detected in multiple avian species, including chicken, duck, quail, pheasant, partridge, pigeon, silky chicken, chukar, and egret.

The report above indicates that, in addition to this 'facilitator' role, the H9N2 viruses can also transmit directly to humans on close contact. However, as H9N2 infection in poultry does not produce severe morbidity or mortality, there is danger that infections in animals remain unrecognized. - Mod.UBA
