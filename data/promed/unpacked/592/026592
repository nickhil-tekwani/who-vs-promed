Four Monmouth Park-based horses tested positive for the respiratory
form of equine herpesvirus (EHV-1), Dr. William Keegan, the
veterinarian caring for the horses, said on Wednesday [25 Oct 2006].

The barn where the horses are stabled has been quarantined since
Sunday morning [22 Oct 2006], when 5 horses were reported to have high fevers.

"We are having 11 horses tested, but for now we've only received the
report of 4 positives from the 1st batch," Keegan said. On Thursday
morning [2 Nov 2006], we should know which ones [of the others] are
positive and which are negative."

Keegan said he has not received results of tests for the neurological
form of EHV-1, but indicated none of the horses are displaying
neurological symptoms. "The horses are bright and alert, and their
fevers are starting to wane and normalize," Keegan said. "I feel like
we caught this early enough to contain it and nip it in time."

EHV-1 manifests in 3 forms: respiratory disease, abortion, and
neurological disease. Neurological symptoms can include a loss of
coordination, the inability to stand, and bladder control problems.

EHV-1 led to quarantines this winter at several tracks, including in
Northern Kentucky, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.

Since Monday [23 Oct 2006], none of the horses under quarantine at
Monmouth have left the barn, and others based at the Oceanport, New
Jersey track have only been allowed to race at the Meadowlands.
Horses shipping from Monmouth to the Meadowlands will be stabled
separately from any other Meadowlands horses and only commingle
during the races.

In addition, the New Jersey Department of Agriculture has issued
guidelines that call for disinfecting the paddock and starting gate
after every race. Each horse shipping to the Meadowlands must also
have its temperature taken prior to leaving Monmouth and again prior
to starting in a race.

Officials with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority enacted
the quarantine on Sunday [22 Oct 2006] after 5 horses in one barn
developed fevers. The horses in quarantine are those trained by John
Forbes, Tim Hills, Bill Anderson, and Justin Nixon.

[Equine herpesvirus is also known as rhinopneumonitis and is a viral
disease (EHV-1) caused by a herpesvirus. It may present as a severe
respiratory infection, but it may also cause a neurological disease
or abortion in pregnant mares. There is a vaccine for it. The
immunity conferred from the disease or the vaccine is relatively
short in duration. Horses on the show or racing circuit are often
vaccinated every 6 months. - Mod.TG]

[The original posting erroneously identified the State of this outbreak as
Kentucky when it is in New Jersey. The title has been changed to reflect
the true geographic location. - Mod.MPP]
