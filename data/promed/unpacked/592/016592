NIBSC Wins Race to Genetically Engineer H5N1 Vaccine Strain
--------------------------------------------------
A British government laboratory has genetically engineered a safe version
of the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus to use as the basis of a vaccine,
beating out the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and St. Jude
Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, who were pursuing the same goal.
The achievement by the National Institute for Biological Standards and
Controls (NIBSC) in London will be announced next week by the World Health
Organization. WHO is overseeing the research, which aims to create a
vaccine against avian influenza A (H5N1) virus as insurance in case the
disease begins to spread rapidly among people.
Avian influenza A (H5N1) virus has flared across Asia since November 2003,
killing 24 humans, most of them children, and triggering the slaughter of
more than 100 million poultry in 10 countries in an attempt to control the
disease. 3 labs -­ the London lab, the CDC, and St. Jude -­ have been
working in labs that have high levels of biosecurity protection, attempting
to alter the highly infectious virus into a vaccine seed stock that could
safely be used in a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant.
At the CDC, however, spokesman David Daigle confirmed that the CDC effort
had not yet reached the goal, and that the agency has been told that the
London lab did. The St. Jude group could not be reached. All 3 labs were
trying to create a new virus using a process called reverse genetics. The
1st step was to insert 2 genetic components [the H5 and N1 encoding
subunits] from the H5N1 avian flu virus into a benign flu virus commonly
used in laboratories. All 3 labs passed that milestone in February 2004.
The 2nd step was to grow the new virus in pure cell lines that would be
acceptable to regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. That was to be followed by safety-testing the reproduced
virus on chickens and ferrets to prove that its virulent qualities were
removed, the final hurdle before the new viral strain could be released to
manufacturers.
Thompson indicated that the new strain will be given to manufacturers next
week when the official announcement is made. 3 manufacturers have agreed to
make sample batches of flu vaccine from the virus and to put the new
vaccine through clinical trials, he said.

[ProMED-mail does not normally record progress in vaccine development and
production. Since the initial goal of genetically engineering a vaccine
production strain has been achieved by one of the 3 competing laboratories,
this thread is now cut. - Mod.CP]
