[With reference to this Moderator's query concerning the verity of a map
(see map at <http://www.izs.it/bluetongue/mappab1.gif> referenced in
"Bluetongue, ruminants - Morocco 20040918.2582") showing a previous
infection with BT 10 in Morocco, we are pleased to have Prof Fadda's
definitive response.

Several times, Prof Fadda has provided insights into the bluetongue
situation in the Mediterranean. His additional authoritative information
highlights how individual contributions from knowledgeable individuals make
ProMED-mail what it is. Thanks again, Prof Fadda, for the summary and
response to the moderator query. - Mod.PC]

The map was from the website of Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale
dell'Abruzzo e del Molise "G.Caporale" -- Italy. Moroccan involvement in
the BT epidemic (BT10) is reported by the same Institute at
<http://gis2.izs.it/bluetongue/descrizione%20malattia/epidemiologia.html>

I never found confirmation of this notice. According to my own information,
the countries involved in 1997-2003 Mediterranean epidemic are:
1997 Greek islands
1998 Greek islands
1999 Mainland Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Algeria, Tunisia
2000 Italy (except northern regions), Turkey, Bulgaria, Algeria, Tunisia,
France (Corsica), Spain (Balearic islands)
2001 Italy (except northern regions), mainland Greece, Macedonia, Bulgaria,
Kosovo, France (Corsica), Croatia, Serbia
2002 Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Serbia
2003 Italy (except northern regions), France (Corsica), Spain (Baleari),
Tunisia, Serbia

I have published an article in Italian on the effect of climate variations
on BTV spread and the situation in the Mediterranean basin (L'espansione
della lingua blu favorita dalle alte temperature. Informatore Agrario 2004;
60(13): 71-4.)
