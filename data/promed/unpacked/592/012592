Increased mumps activity is currently being reported in 3 Canadian
provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island).
Mumps is an acute viral infection of the salivary glands. Symptoms
include fever, headache, muscle ache, and swelling and tenderness of
the salivary glands at the angle of the jaw (parotid glands).
Infection occurs through direct contact with respiratory droplets
from the nose or throat, through saliva, coughing, sneezing, sharing
drinks, kissing, or from contact with any surface that has been
contaminated with the mumps virus. Rarely, mumps infection can lead
to meningitis, inflammation of the testicles or ovaries, inflammation
of the pancreas, and transient or permanent hearing loss.
As of Thu 26 Apr 2007, 183 confirmed cases of mumps had been reported
from the 3 affected provinces. Confirmed cases include both
laboratory-confirmed cases, as well as, clinically confirmed cases
that are linked to laboratory-confirmed cases. In Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick, the majority of cases were reported from only one or 2
public health authorities with limited activity seen elsewhere in
these provinces. Approximately 90 percent and 25 percent of the cases
in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick respectively, are associated with
university settings. The viral strain in these outbreaks is identical
to the strain (genotype G) detected from the 2005-06 Nova Scotia
outbreaks, the United States' multi-state outbreak in 2006, and the
United Kingdom epidemic between 2004 and 2006.
[The data for the 3 provinces (age and sex of confirmed cases now
slightly out-dated) are tabulated and presented as a histogram in the
original text which should be consulted for precise information]
Confirmed cases include both laboratory-confirmed and clinical cases
(latter are epi-linked to laboratory-confirmed cases). Information on
date of onset is known for 132 of the 183 confirmed mumps cases
reported. The remaining 51 cases are pending or missing dates of
onset. Clinical-confirmed refers to cases that have clinical symptoms
characteristic of mumps PLUS are epidemiologically linked to
laboratory-confirmed cases (but have not themselves been laboratory-confirmed
Table: Age and Sex Distribution of Confirmed Mumps Cases Reported in
3 Canadian Provinces, 26 Apr 2007 (N=183)
Province / Number / Median age / percentage male
Nova Scotia / 154 / 21.5 / 44
New Brunswick / 28 / 22 / 57
Prince Edward Island / 1 / 18 / 100
The majority of cases are occurring among university-aged
individuals. The reason for the particular susceptibility among this
cohort is multifactorial. The very social and mobile lifestyle of
this age group appears to be facilitating disease transmission and is
posing barriers to the adherence of isolation requests. Communication
efforts are increasing as the post-secondary academic year [ends] and
students disperse. Additional cases in this demographic group and
possibly other jurisdictions would not be unexpected. However, during
previous outbreaks in Canada, this has not resulted in sustained
transmission or large outbreaks.
It is assumed that most people over the age of approximately 40 years
have natural immunity to mumps. Most people between the ages of 12
and 17 years (depending on the province of residence) have had 2
doses of mumps vaccine due to the introduction of a second dose of
measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine for measles control in
1996-97. This has left a susceptible cohort of people between the
approximate ages of 12 or 17 (depending on the province or territory)
and 40 years who were only eligible for one dose of MMR vaccine and
who are not assumed to have natural immunity. It is important to
note, that the age at which natural immunity to mumps can be assumed
is not known with certainty.
The 2004 national immunization coverage survey (NICS) found that 94
percent of Canadian children had received single dose of the MMR
vaccine by their 2nd birthday. Coverage estimates for the second dose
of MMR by 7 years of age was 79 percent. Finally, 93 percent of
Canadians had received one or more doses of mumps vaccine by their
17th birthday.
Public Health actions
---------------------
Cases are asked to self-isolate for a period of 9 days following
onset of symptoms. The vaccine status of close contacts is assessed
and updated so that they receive 2 doses of MMR. Guidelines have been
put in place for health care workers who are cases or who are
contacts of mumps cases.
Public health and primary care providers are encouraged to refer to
their local or provincial/territorial ministry of health for specific
recommendations on action that may be required within that jurisdiction.
All provinces and territories, have been informed of the
epidemiologic situation and the public health management strategies
in the affected jurisdictions. Based on this, all jurisdictions are
encouraged to continue monitoring mumps activity within their regions
and report any changes and/or cases to the Public Health Agency of
Canada, particularly in provinces and territories not currently
affected by the on-going outbreak.
The Public Health Agency of Canada will continue to provide updates
on the current outbreak of mumps. The Agency is working with the
affected provinces in monitoring this outbreak, providing technical
advice, and assisting with laboratory testing of clinical specimens
at the National Microbiology Laboratory. The Public Health Agency of
Canada supports the provincial outbreak response strategies that
include the recommended isolation of cases and targeted immunization
of contacts. There are on-going discussions regarding an expanded
immunization strategy to target the susceptible cohort.
The Public Health Agency of Canada encourages parents, guardians, and
adults to maintain up to date immunizations for themselves and their
children, and encourages susceptible individuals to be immunized in
accordance with the National Advisory Committee on Immunization
(NACI) guidelines. All guidelines can be accessed at
