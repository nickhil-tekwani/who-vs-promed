[Re: ProMED-mail Hantavirus update - Americas (41): USA (NYC) Seoul virus, rat reservoir 20141017.2872156
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The premise that Seoul virus (SEOV), recently demonstrated By C Firth et al with quantitative PCR in 8/133 (6 per cent) wild Norway rats [_Rattus norvegicus_, brown, common, or wharf rat], captured in New York City (NYC), has "probably been introduced recently in NYC", and consequently may "represent a potential risk to human health in the city" should be received with great circumspection, and viewed at least in due historical perspective of what we learned already over more that 30 years about the importance (or not) of SEOV in the West, as a human pathogen transmitted by the omnipresent wild rat.

First, and as remarked already by the moderator, back in the pioneer period (early 1980's) of hantavirus research, SEOV was found and even isolated from wild rats (mostly wharf rats), virtually everywhere they where looked for, including Latin America (Belem, Brazil 1985) (LeDuc et al, 1985), and even Africa (Cairo, Egypt, 1983), where, from wharf rats captured in Cairo, 2 SEOV isolates were obtained (HW Lee, world NRC for hantaviruses, Seoul Korea). These 2 facts are seemingly forgotten now, since most current hantavirus reviews still specify that both former continents (Latin America and Africa) are devoid of "hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome" (HFRS), that is, the clinical picture induced (amongst other) by SEOV.

As for American cities, NYC is now exactly the 6th major port city in the USA where SEOV was found in local urban rats. The 1st (1992) hantavirus-positive rats were found in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and in Houston, Texas (no authors listed, preliminary evidence that Hantaan or a closely related virus is enzootic in domestic rodents (N Engl J Med. 1982; 307(10), 623-5). The 1st (1984) pathogenic hantavirus isolated in the New World was a SEOV from a wild rat caught in Philadelphia, and called the _Girard Point virus_ (LeDuc et al, 1984). Of note, this isolation occurred thus 10 years before the etiologic agent of the much more reported "hantavirus pulmonary syndrome" (HPS) was described. Further SEOV isolations followed in 1985 from feral rats (_Rattus norvegicus_), caught in New Orleans (Tchoupitoulas virus) (Tsai et al, 1985), and in 1987 in Baltimore, MD (Baltimore rat virus) (Childs et al, 1987). For an overview, see: Clement J, Maes P, Van Ranst M: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in the new, and Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome in the Old World: Paradi(se)gm lost or regained? Virus Res. 2014; 187: 55-8. doi: 10.1016/j.virusres.2013.12.036. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2013.12.036.

The mere fact that SEOV was found to be infecting up to 57 per cent (in Baltimore) of the examined rats, without noticeable health problems over 3 decades for the local human populations of these 5 American port cities, seems not to predict now a "new" zoonotic risk for NYC. When most reviewers classically repeat that HFRS is relevant only for the Old World, but absent altogether from the New World, Firth et al now propose the opposite, that is, that human (SEOV) infection has been associated in the USA with (I quote) "multiple cases of HFRS". When the former classical statement remains obviously wrong (not in the least given the presence in the USA of millions of potentially SEOV-infected rats), by contrast the latter assertion is overemphasizing the real epidemiological importance so far of SEOV-infected rats in the West, and in the USA in particular.

Indeed, a total of only 5 SEOV-induced HFRS human cases have been serologically and/or biomolecularly confirmed so far in the USA: very early (1994), 3 Maryland HFRS cases were proven with plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) to be a Baltimore rat virus-induced nephropathy (Glass GE, Watson AJ, LeDuc JW, Childs JE: Domestic cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in the United States. Nephron 1994; 68(1): 48-51; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7991040). The 4th case was proven with positive RT-PCR in the acute phase to be another domestic case of SEOV nephropathy, again in Maryland, in a patient with no known exposure to rats, who had never travelled abroad, and with a negative rodent capture action around his home (Woods C, Palekar R, Kim P, et al: Domestically acquired Seoul virus causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, 2008-Maryland. Clin Infect Dis, 2009; 49(10): e109-12. doi: 10.1086/644742; http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/49/10/e109.long). The final and 5th case was documented with both renal and pulmonary (fatal) involvement in Texas, and underscores thus another under-recognized fact, that is, that so-called Old World hantaviruses like SEOV can also cause a fatal "HPS" (Roig IL, Musher DM, Tweardy DJ: Severe Pulmonary Involvement in a Case Attributed to Domestically Acquired Seoul Hantavirus in the United States. Clin Infect Dis, 2012; 54(1): 91-4. doi: 10.1093/cid/cir748; http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/1/91.long). The finding that 4 out of 5 cases of domestic SEOV-nephropathy in the USA were registered in the Baltimore region so far, where the bulk of epidemiological SEOV research had been done, suggests that low medical awareness is probably the most important explanation of the paucity of American HFRS cases to date.

The suggestion of a so-called recent introduction of this SEOV (Baxter virus) in wild rats of NYC merits even a more careful scrutiny in the light of what is known already about the origin of SEOV found so far in wild rats in the West. The main argument of C Firth et al is the close genetic relationship with the SEOV (Humber virus), isolated recently (2012) in the UK, with an estimated the time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for both the Baxter and Humber strains at 3-16 years before present (ybp). However, the British authors found to their surprise Humber very closely related to the very 1st hantavirus (another SEOV) isolated in the UK, and in their own institution (PHE, Porton Down, Salisbury, UK), and called IR461 (Jameson LJ, Logue CH, Atkinson B, et al: The continued emergence of hantaviruses: Isolation of a Seoul virus implicated in human disease, United Kingdom, October 2012. Euro Surveill. 2013; 18(1): 4-7; http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20344). This unexpected finding was confirmed with the subsequent isolation of Cherwell virus, resulting in a neat "British" clade of SEOV viruses, grouping together Humber, Cherwell, and IR461 (Jameson LJ, Taori SK, Atkinson B, et al: Pet rats as a source of hantavirus in England and Wales, 2013. Euro Surveill. 2013; 18(9): pii=20415; http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20415).

However, IR461 had been obtained already in the late 1970s, and had been isolated from SEOV-infected rats imported from Belgium, and having caused a SEOV laboratory outbreak in PHE, Porton Down (Lloyd G, Jones N: Infection of laboratory workers with hantavirus acquired from immunocytomas propagated in laboratory rats. J Infect. 1986; 12(2): 117-25; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2871112). After a long shelf life, IR461 was finally genetically characterized in 2003, that is, at least 24 years after its 1st isolation in 1979 in PHE. IR461 was confirmed as being SEOV, but against all expectations, appeared not related to any known SEOV derived from laboratory rats. The conclusion was that IR461 resulted most likely from an introduction, in Belgium or elsewhere in Eurasia, of a wild rat strain into a colony of laboratory rats (Shi X, McCaughey C, Elliott RM: Genetic characterisation of a hantavirus isolated from a laboratory-acquired Infection. J Med Virol. 2003; 71(1): 105-9; http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmv.10446).

Since Baxter SEOV must be closely related not only to Humber, but to IR461 viruses as well, that is, a SEOV isolated since now more than 3 decades, and for which no alternative TMRCA was calculated, a recent introduction of Baxter SEOV into NYC seems highly unlikely.

[ProMED-mail thanks Jan Clement for this historical summary of detection of SEOV in the Americas and elsewhere, and its relation to a very few number of cases of human disease in the USA. Little can be added to his summary.

One hopes that his concern about lack of medical awareness of HFRS will change, and the true picture of HFRS incidence will emerge, not just in Baltimore but also in the other port cities in the USA where SEOV-related viruses have been detected in rats.
