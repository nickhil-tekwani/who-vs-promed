Ankole cattle corridor faces anthrax outbreak
-------------------------------------------
Two people have already been reported dead in Sheema District, and the
region has now moved a quarantine on all animals.

The Ankole cattle corridor is on high alert following an anthrax
outbreak that claimed the lives of two people in Sheema District, last
week. The district health inspector, Mr Francis Mugume, said five
other people were admitted to Kabwohe Health Centre IV in critical
condition.

Mr Mugume identified the dead as males aged 56 years and 67 years, all
butchers in Mashojwa Village, Kagango Sub-county. [Previous reports
indicated that a third butcher might be among the sick. MHJ] Sheema
District Health Officer Johnson Kabwishwa told Daily Monitor that a
partial quarantine has been imposed on the sub-counties of Muzira,
Kibingo, Kagango, and Kabwohe Itendero Town Council to stem the spread
of the disease. "As a control measure, beef and its products have been
banned in the affected sub-counties and farmers have started
immunising their animals. We advise that dead animals should be buried
immediately," Mr Kyabwisho said.

Mbarara District veterinary officer Lewis Barigye said they are
investigating the cause of the death of a cow in Kyantamba Mixed Farm
in Kashaari. He said drugs for vaccination are readily available on
the open market in pharmacies and farmers should be able to vaccinate
their animals with the guidance of sub-county veterinary staff. The
district leadership held a meeting yesterday and slammed quarantine on
all movements of animals in the district.

Bushenyi veterinary officer Rusoke Tibakyenga said ring vaccination
will be carried out at the border with Sheema. "We have put up a
roadblock at Rwentuuha Township and will start immunisation today (7
Nov 2011) along the border of Bushenyi with Sheema District. We have
placed announcements on radios and there are talk shows to educate the
public about the dangers of the disease," Dr Rusoke said.

In Isingiro District, the district veterinary officer, Dr Bruhan
Kasozi, said the area was safe while Kiruhura's Francis Mugisha said
the district is already under quarantine.

[Much of this is a repetition of yesterday's reports (see ProMED-mail
archive no 20111107.3316) but control activities, both voluntary and
compulsory, are now in place. So far, cases, whether human or bovine,
have been seen in the Sheema and Mbarara districts. The neighbouring
districts of Bushenyi, Isingiro, and Kiruhura are under alert with
quarantine measures and vaccination advisories, and some compulsory
vaccination.
