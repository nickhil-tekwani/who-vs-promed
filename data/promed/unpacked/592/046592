Poliovirus Weekly Update, as of 28 Nov 2018, World Health Organization
--------------------------------
New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 0
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2018: 27
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 22

New cVDPV cases reported this week: 1
Total number of cVDPV cases (all types) in 2018: 91
Total number of cVDPV cases (all types) in 2017: 96

Headlines
Summary of new viruses this week:
- Afghanistan - advance notification of 1 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case and 6 positive WPV1 environmental samples.
- Pakistan - 2 WPV1 positive environmental samples.
- Niger - 1 case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2).

[Comments from the GPEI/WHO re: approaching eradication]
- Nominal variations (up or down) in the number of newly reported cases at this point of the polio endgame -- although tragic for the affected children and their families -- are not operationally overwhelming, especially considering the population size in the 3 remaining endemic countries (upwards of 90 million children aged less than 5 years). However, confirmation of even a single polio case anywhere points to remaining vaccination coverage gaps that must be filled to achieve eradication.
- Over and beyond case numbers, the GPEI and its partners actively and continuously evaluate a wide range of epidemiological, virological, programmatic, operational, surveillance, financial, and social data, the analysis of which drives strategic planning and enables target eradication efforts.
- The 3 remaining endemic countries continue to intensify their eradication efforts, through implementation of national polio emergency action plans. Underpinning these plans is the data analysis, to identify area-specific challenges and reasons why children are being missed (i.e., due to population movement, inaccessibility, lack of infrastructure, inadequate microplanning, resistance, etc.) and putting in place area-specific solutions to overcome those reasons. By clearly identifying high-risk areas, teams are able to allocate and prioritize technical assistance to those areas. Afghanistan recently concluded a targeted national campaign.
- Analysis in 2018 by both GPEI partners and independent technical advisory groups, reviewing all available evidence, concludes that the near-term feasibility of eradication is possible, if remaining vaccination coverage gaps are rapidly filled, and the GPEI and its partners continue to work towards this goal.
- The aim is to urgently interrupt the remaining strains of wild poliovirus transmission, not only to eradicate such strains in their own right and prevent their global re-emergence, but also to subsequently remove oral polio vaccines (OPV) from routine immunization programmes globally, to eliminate the long-term risks of vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs).
- The ultimate aim of the GPEI is to secure and sustain a world where no child will ever again be paralyzed by any poliovirus, be it wild or vaccine-derived.

Afghanistan
- There is advance notification of 1 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case in Uruzgan province, Shahid-e-Hassas district, with onset of paralysis on [9 Oct 2018]. Once confirmed (officially to be reflected in next week's data), this will bring the total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 in the country to 20.
- 6 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported this week: 2 from Nangarhar province, Jalalabad and Behsud districts, 3 from Kandahar province, Kandahar district, and 1 from Hilmand province, Lashkargarh district. Samples were collected between [26 Sep 2018-5 Nov 2018].

Pakistan
- No cases of WPV1 have been reported this week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 in the country is 8.
- 2 WPV1-positive environmental samples have been reported: 1 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Bannu district, and the other from Sindh province, Karachi district. Samples were collected on [26 Oct 2018 and 7 Nov 2018], respectively.
- It is important to note that cases are reported this year from only 4 districts across the country, and that no WPV cases (except one from Gadap, greater Karachi) have been reported from core reservoir areas in 2018. Twenty years ago, the entire country was affected by polio, and every year, more than 35 000 children were paralyzed for life by the disease.

Nigeria
- No cases of cVDPV2 cases were reported this week.
- No cases of WPV1 were reported. The most recently detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, the 1st centered in Jigawa state with subsequent spread to other states as well as to neighbouring Republic of Niger, and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- Recent confirmation of spread of one of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent of mOPV2 response.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad Basin
- One case of cVDPV2 has been reported in the past week from Zinder region, Magaria district. There are 8 total number of cVDPV2 reported cases in 2018 in Niger, which are genetically linked to a cVDPV2 outbreak originating in Jigawa, Nigeria. The virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2018 through 7 Sep 2018].
- AFP surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- WHO and its partners are continuing to support local public health authorities in conducting field investigations and risk assessments to more clearly assess risk of the identified cVDPV2 and to conduct additional response measures as appropriate and necessary.
- Active case-finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded.
- WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health to strengthen the risk communication and community engagement.

Central Africa
- No cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
- DRC is affected by 3 separate strains of cVDPV2, in the provinces of Mongala, Maniema, and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- Following the Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication in July 2016, the 2 large scale vaccination rounds implemented during September and October 2018 demonstrated better vaccination quality. Planning is underway to maintain the gains made so far and maintain population immunity as well as sensitive surveillance across the country.
- The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to an ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network, to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner (as was the case during the recent Ebola outbreak in Equateur province, which was successfully stopped).
- Partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative will continue to support authorities across the country to ensure that this new level of commitment rapidly translates into operational improvements on the ground.

Horn of Africa
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- Somalia has reported a total of 12 cVDPV cases (5 type 2, 6 type 3, and 1, coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) in 2018. CVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in 1 environmental sample in Kenya.
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia. Another vaccination round is planned during end-November [2018] as part of the ongoing outbreak response to further enhance the population immunity in the highest risk areas. Special surveillance activities continue to be undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week.
- The total number of cVDPV1 cases in the country in 2018 is 25.
- Emergency operation centres are established and operational at the national level and in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nationwide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15, due to large numbers of poorly immunized older children.
- Planning is underway for the next steps of the outbreak response, focusing on both vaccination and surveillance for polioviruses.
- Detection and reporting of new viruses or cases at this point in the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected, as surveillance is being strengthened, and most reported and confirmed cases had onset of paralysis prior to the start of comprehensive outbreak response.

Middle East
- No cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week in Syria. The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 remains 74. There are no cases reported in 2018. The most recent case (by date of onset of paralysis) was reported in Boukamal district, with onset on [21 Sep 2017].
- Efforts are ongoing to maintain sensitive surveillance for polioviruses.

The number of polio cases recorded in Afghanistan has risen to 20 this year [2018] after a new case was confirmed in the southern region, the Ministry of Public Health said on [Wed 28 Nov 2018].

The latest case of wild polio virus was detected in Shaheede-e-Hassas district in the southern province of Uruzgan, bringing to 2 the number of the polio virus cases in the district, Xinhua news agency quoted the Ministry as saying.

The paralyzed 3-year-old boy had never been vaccinated due to his family's refusal to go for polio vaccination.

A total of 14 cases have been recorded in southern Afghanistan, and the 6 other cases reported in eastern Afghan provinces so far this year [2018].

Polio virus could be transferred rapidly, and the only preventable way was vaccination, the statement noted.

The ongoing insurgency and conflicts have been hindering the efforts to stamp out the infectious disease in the country.

[This media report gives details on the advanced notice case of polio mentioned in the global report. Basically, the patient is a 3-year-old child with no history of having received any doses of vaccine due to family refusal to vaccinate. This is an unfortunate occurrence, but a similar story to other cases of WPV1-associated disease and cVDPV-associated disease. - Mod.MPP]
