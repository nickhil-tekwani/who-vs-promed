Isn't the "red field mouse" mentioned in the report likely to be a
red-backed vole (_Clethrionomys_ sp.)?

[Andy may be right, but still the common name used in the report was not
sufficiently clear; this is the reason we use scientific names. Puumala
virus is the etiologic agent of what is known in Scandinavia as elsewhere
as Nephropathia Epidemica, a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome (HFRS). The usual vertebrate host of Puumala virus is the bank
vole, _Clethrionomys glareolus_. 52 different species of mammals have been
shown to serve as hosts of hantaviruses in Russia (EA Tkachenko et al.
[1998 HFRS in Eurasia: Russia and the republics of the former USSR, in HW
Lee, C Calisher, C Schmaljohn [eds. Manual of hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Asan Inst. for Life Sciences,
Seoul, Republic of Korea, pp:49-57). Three of these belong to the genus
_Clethrionomys_: _glareolus_ (bank vole), _rufocanus_ (gray-sided vole),
and _rutilus_ (ruddy vole or Northern red-backed vole). Data, rather than
opinion and guesses, are needed. If someone in the epidemic area of
Tatarstan can provide such data, we would be appreciative. - Mod. CHC
