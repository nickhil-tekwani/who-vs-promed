Use of Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis for Investigation of a Cluster of
Invasive Group A Streptococcal Illness -- Spokane, Washington, 1999
----------------------------------------------------------
On January 25, 1999, health officials in Spokane County, Washington, were
notified of a fatal case of necrotizing fasciitis (NF) caused by
community-acquired invasive group A streptococcus (GAS) infection. Although
invasive GAS infection is not a reportable disease in Washington, Spokane
health officials requested reports of additional invasive GAS cases from
local hospital infection-control professionals and the medical examiner to
identify other cases. This report describes a cluster of fatal illnesses
caused by GAS in five residents of Spokane County and illustrates how
investigators used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to determine
whether the cluster was unrelated sporadic cases or attributable to a
common source..
Including the index case, five cases were identified, with illness onsets
from January 25 through March 25. All cases were community acquired and
fatal within 5 days of onset. All occurred in women aged 24-59 years. Four
patients were morbidly obese (weights were 350, 374, and approximately 350
lbs.; weight was not recorded for one). Four lived in the city of Spokane,
and one lived in a nearby town.
NF was diagnosed in four patients, and sepsis was diagnosed in one. GAS was
isolated from both blood and wound tissue in three patients, from blood in
one patient, and from a wound in one patient. Three had pre-existing skin
breakdown at the NF site: one had had an open surgical abdominal wound for
several months, one had chronic venous stasis of the legs with cellulitis
and ulceration, and one had severe recurrent genital herpes.
GAS isolates from the five patients yielded four distinct PFGE patterns.
The patterns of isolates from two patients were identical, while each
pattern of the isolates from the other three patients was unique. Isolates
from the two patients with identical PFGE patterns also had identical T-
and emm-types (emm-type 1); isolates from the other three patients were
unique (emm-types 3, 11, and 12). No epidemiologic relation between the two
patients with identical isolates could be established.

Editorial Note:
The cases of GAS (i.e., _Streptococcus pyogenes_) infection described in
this report were clustered in time and geographic area, suggesting they
were epidemiologically related. This report provides evidence that PFGE can
be useful for assisting epidemiologic investigations of illnesses caused by
GAS. In this investigation, PFGE results were concordant with traditional
typing methods, performed locally, and available within 4 days of
submission of the isolates. The investigators used PFGE to determine that
the five cases, despite their similarities, did not represent a
common-source outbreak but were a clustering of sporadic cases. PFGE
testing provided evidence that a search for a common-source for these
infections, which would have required substantial public-health resources,
was not warranted.

[Because of the serious nature of necrotizing fasciitis, we frequently
receive news reports of these cases suggesting that an epidemiologically
significant cluster of cases has been identified. This study illustrates
the need for careful analysis of bacterial isolates before one can conclude
that such clusters represent a common source outbreak. - Mod.ES
