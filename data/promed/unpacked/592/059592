Influenza update 246, based on data up to 6 Sep 2015
----------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Globally, influenza activity continued in the Southern hemisphere, with overall slightly decreased activity in Oceania, further decreases in temperate South America and low activity in South Africa.

In the Northern hemisphere countries, respiratory virus activity remained low in general and influenza activity continued at low, inter-seasonal levels. Influenza type A predominated in sporadic detections. A number of countries have ceased or reduced surveillance activity during the inter-seasonal period.

Few influenza detections were reported from Africa. In Eastern Africa, in countries with reported influenza activity, influenza type A predominated. In Western Africa, influenza activity decreased overall.

In tropical countries of the Americas, Central America, and the Caribbean, influenza activity remained at low levels, with the exception of Cuba, where still high although decreasing levels of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) were reported, associated with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detections.

In tropical Asia, countries in Southern Asia, and South East Asia reported overall low influenza activity although India reported a minor increase in activity predominantly with A(H1N1)pdm09. Influenza activity showed a decline but was still at mid-levels in southern China with influenza A(H3N2) predominating.

In temperate South America, influenza activity remained low in general. However, ILI activity sharply increased in Chile with increasing influenza detections. Influenza A remained the most detected influenza virus while RSV detections decreased in the region.

In South Africa, influenza activity remained at low levels with influenza type B viruses predominating in recent weeks.

In Australia, influenza activity seemed to be past the peak except in South Australia where it continued to rise with predominantly influenza B viruses followed by influenza A(H3N2) virus detections. In New Zealand, influenza activity may have peaked in the second week of August with influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses predominating during the season. ILI activity was still above the seasonal threshold but below the alert threshold.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 69 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 24 Aug 2015 to 6 Sep 2015 (data as of 17 Sep 2015 12:08:20 UTC).The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 24 771 specimens during that time period. 2514 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1872 (74.5 percent) were typed as influenza A and 642 (25.5 percent) as influenza B. Of the subtyped influenza A viruses, 354 (25.8 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1016 (74.2 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 60 (85.7 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage, and 10 (14.3 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Influenza activity remained at low, inter-seasonal levels in the countries of the northern hemisphere. A lot of countries have reduced or ceased reporting during this inter-seasonal period.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Tropical countries of Central America, the Caribbean and South America
The Caribbean, Central America, and Andean Sub-region reported low or decreasing influenza and RSV activity during the period of this report. Cuba has been reporting decreasing but still high levels of ILI and SARI, due to influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09 activity and RSV. In tropical South American countries, influenza A(H3N2) viruses were predominant with some influenza B co-circulating.

African tropical region
In East Africa, where few countries have been reporting influenza activity, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the predominant virus. Madagascar seemed to have had increased influenza activity over the last 2 months, due to mainly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.

In Western Africa, Ghana reported influenza virus detections of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses.

Of the countries reporting data from Middle Africa, Cameroon continued to report low detections of influenza A (H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, and B viruses in recent weeks

Tropical Asia
Southern Asia reported overall low or decreasing levels of influenza activity during this reporting period.

India reported a small increase in activity with predominantly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and also influenza B viruses in recent weeks. In Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of China, influenza activity remained low.

South East Asia, including Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, The Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore reported overall decreasing influenza activity, with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Temperate South America
In temperate South America, ILI and SARI activity was variable but low overall. Influenza activity remained steady while RSV activity decreased. Overall, influenza activity so far this season has been mild with respect to previous seasons, except in Chile and Paraguay where it has been comparable to previous seasons. Influenza type A viruses predominated, with A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) co-circulating, In Argentina, ILI activity remained at low, expected levels, while SARI activity remained elevated but decreasing. Influenza activity remained at low levels with influenza A viruses most commonly detected.

In Chile, ILI activity sharply increased in recent weeks, later than has occurred in previous seasons and to a higher level than in 2014. SARI activity also slightly increased in recent weeks, but comparable to previous seasons. Influenza activity continued to increase with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and influenza B viruses co-circulating. RSV activity remained increased at moderate levels.

Southern Africa
South Africa continued to report low levels of influenza activity in recent weeks. Influenza B was predominant during this reporting period, whereas influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses were predominant earlier in the season.

Oceania, Melanesia, and Polynesia
Seasonal activity appears to have peaked in most of Australia except in South Australia where it continued to rise. Influenza type B (Yamagata lineage) viruses continued to be predominant nationally with co-circulation of mainly influenza A(H3N2). In the Australian capital territory and Western Australia, influenza A continued to replace influenza B. The seasonal influenza vaccines appeared to be a good match for circulating strains with 83 percent samples matching the trivalent seasonal vaccine.

In New Zealand, influenza activity may have peaked in the 2nd week of August [2015], with influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses predominating. ILI activity was above the seasonal threshold but below the alert threshold.

Both French Polynesia and the Pacific Islands reported variable ILI activity with an increasing trend in the Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, French Polynesia, Guam, and Northern Mariana Islands.
