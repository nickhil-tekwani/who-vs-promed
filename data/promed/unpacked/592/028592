Epidemiological summary

- Nigeria continues to report sporadic cases of monkeypox since September 2017;
- In the reporting month [December 2019], 6 new suspected monkeypox cases were reported from 5 sates: Lagos (1), Rivers (1), Oyo (1), Imo (1), and Plateau (2);
- Of the suspected cases 2 were confirmed positive for monkeypox in Rivers (1) and Imo (1) states;
- One case of monkeypox was confirmed in the UK on 4 Dec 2019 in a traveler from Nigeria;
- No death was recorded in the reporting month;
- In 2019, a total of 113 suspected cases were reported between January and December. Of the suspected cases, 46 were confirmed from 9 states (Bayelsa, Lagos, Delta, Rivers, Akwa Ibom, Enugu, Anambra, Cross River, and Oyo), and 1 death was recorded;
- 4 states (Lagos, Delta, Rivers, and Bayelsa) recorded 85% of the confirmed cases in Nigeria in 2019 - Table 1;
- Additionally, 2 monkeypox cases were confirmed in the UK and Singapore in travelers from Nigeria during the year [2019]. The 2 cases had travelled to Delta state and departed Nigeria through the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos;
- The most affected age-group is 21-40 years with 78% of confirmed cases (range: 1-51years; median age: 32 years) - Figure 2;
- Males are more affected (male-to-female ratio = 3:1);
- From the 1st cases in September 2017 to November 2019, a total of 183 confirmed cases and 9 deaths have been recorded in 18 states (Rivers, Bayelsa, Cross River, Imo, Akwa Ibom, Lagos, Delta, Bauchi, FCT, Abia, Oyo, Enugu, Ekiti, Nasarawa, Benue, Plateau, Edo, Anambra).

[The sporadic monkeypox (MPX) cases were widely distributed in Nigeria in 2019, having occurred in 9 states in 2019. From September 2017 to November 2019, with 9 deaths in 183 cases, the CFR (case fatality rate) is 5%. Nigeria has been a source of MPX cases that have been imported into other countries, most recently into the UK (see <Monkeypox - UK: ex Nigeria 20191206.6827532>) and Singapore (see <Monkeypox - Singapore ex Nigeria 20190511.6464598>).

There is no mention in the above report how many of the MPX cases were acquired from wildlife hosts or how many were due to contact with infected people. Prevention of MPX virus infections will not be possible without knowing the source of infection and locality where they occurred. The question remains about the source of these recent infections. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. A vaccine that is expected to be effective against MPX has been developed recently, but deciding where to mount a campaign in this broad geographic area would be a challenge.

The MPX virus clade involved in these and previous cases is not mentioned. As noted in previous ProMED-mail posts, the monkeypox virus clade in the Congo Basin causes more severe disease in humans -- with a case fatality rate of 10-17% -- than the clade in Ghana, which causes few fatalities. The reported case fatality rate in Nigeria is comparatively low. - Mod.TY
