Malaria has claimed the lives of more than 700 people in Gombe state
in the last 2.5 years according to Mallam Ahmed Audu. Evaluating
Officer of the World Bank Assisted Malaria Control Booster Project in
Gombe.

Mallam Ahmed Audu made this revelation recently in Dukku LGA [Local
Government Area] of the state during an interactive session organized
for working journalists in the state.

He said more than 100 deaths occurred between February and May this
year [2011] alone even as he pointed out that about 170 000 people
were infected by the malaria scourge in the 11 Local Government Areas
of the State from 2009 to May 2011.

According to the project monitoring officer, about 46 000 out of the
malaria prevalence rate were recorded between February and May this
year [2011]. Audu, however, stated that the project had in February
this year distributed over 130 000 doses of malaria drugs to all
government hospitals in the 11 local government areas in the state.

He further said about 2 million doses of malaria preventive drugs for
pregnant women and children were donated to the state Ministry of
Health for use during the Children Health Week in May this year.

Also speaking, the Project Manager, Dr. Arnold Abel stated that
malaria accounted for the loss of over N130 billion [about USD 844
million] annually in Nigeria as well as for 30 percent deaths in
children and 5 percent in pregnant women.

In his speech, the Project Mobilization officer, Mallam Muhammad
Lawal, said there were plans to produce jingles, drama, and programmes
on malaria attacks and treatment on the state radio and television
stations in an effort to reduce its spread, especially among poor
rural communities. He also said the Project collaborated with the
State Environmental Protection Agency (GOSEPA) on refuse disposal
while plans were underway to resurrect sanitary departments in the 11
local government areas of the state.

[Gombe State is located in the eastern part of Nigeria and has
approximately 2 353 000 inhabitants (2006). With 170 000 cases between
February and May 2011, this is roughly equivalent to an annual
incidence rate of 200 cases per 1000 population per year.

2 previous studies found that pregnant women were malaria microscopy
positive in 8 percent and 9.4 percent respectively (VanderJagt TA et
al: Comparison of the OptiMAL rapid test and microscopy for detection
of malaria in pregnant women in Nigeria. Trop Med Int Health. 2005;
10(1): 39-41;
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2004.01349.x/full.

pregnant women in northern Nigeria. J Health Popul Nutr. 2007; 25(1):
75-81; http://www.jhpn.net/index.php/jhpn/article/view/677). If
these figure are representative of the prevalence in the general
population the parasite positive rate has increased.
