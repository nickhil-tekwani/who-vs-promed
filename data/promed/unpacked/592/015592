- At the end of October 2019, a total of 2482 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), including 854 associated deaths (case fatality rate, 34.4%), were reported globally; the majority of these cases were reported from Saudi Arabia (2090 cases, including 776 related deaths with a case fatality rate of 37.1%).

- During the month of October [2019], a total of 14 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS were reported globally. Thirteen of the cases were reported from Saudi Arabia with 3 associated deaths and 1 case was reported from United Arab Emirates. One healthcare worker was also infected this month [October 2019] while providing care for a case. No other cluster of cases was reported this month. Two of the cases had their symptom onset in September [2019]. The 3 deaths reported were within the 70-79 age-group.

- The demographic and epidemiological characteristics of reported cases, when compared during the same corresponding period of 2014 to 2019, do not show any significant difference or change. The number of cases reported in this period was less than all other corresponding periods.

- The age-group 50-59 years continues to be at the highest risk for acquiring infection of primary cases. The age-group 30-39 years is most at risk for secondary cases. The number of deaths is higher in the age-group 50-59 years for primary cases and 70-79 years for secondary cases.

[These monthly updates are very helpful, and we look forward to the WHO monthly DON (Disease Outbreak News) that contains more details on exposure histories. One noteworthy piece of information is that this summary mentions 13 cases reported from Saudi Arabia during the month of October 2019. Checking the MOH website on a daily basis, during the month of October 2019, there was a report of a 10-year-old male from Onaizah, Al Qasim region on 26 Oct 2019 that was numbered 19-1962 and was removed from the website on 28 Oct 2019. One can't help but wonder if this is the 13th case reported from Saudi Arabia and referred to in the above monthly situation update. We await clarification with the information forthcoming in the WHO monthly detailed summary. - Mod.MPP]
