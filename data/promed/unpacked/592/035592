[2] Australia (Queensland) ex Bali
Date: Mon 21 Jul 2008
From: Dr. Jeffrey Hanna

Since the beginning of May [2008], 4 travellers
from Bali have had dengue confirmed soon after
arrival in north Queensland, Australia. All 4
were probably viraemic whilst in north
Queensland, and all 4 were confirmed as having
dengue serotype 3. This indicates that dengue 3
is currently circulating in destinations
frequented by travellers/tourists in Bali.

The only other importations into north Queensland
from Bali this year were 2 travellers with
confirmed serotype 4 dengue in March [2008].

[This confirms another example of _Aedes_
mosquito-transmitted viruses in Bali, dengue 3
and 4 in this report and chikungunya (reported in
ProMED post 20080720.2198 of 20 Jul 2008),
underscoring the risk of dissemination of these
viruses in viremic international travelers. There
was a small outbreak of dengue in Townsville and
Thuringowa, Queensland, in March - April 2007
(see ProMED post no. 20070416.1263). ProMED
thanks Dr. Hanna for sharing this information
concerning recent dengue cases originating in
Bali, and would be interested in knowing if there
are _Aedes aegypti_ present in Cairns in numbers
sufficient to present a risk of either dengue or
chikungunya virus transmission there.

In the capital yesterday [16 Jul 2008],
6 people were admitted to different hospitals
with dengue [virus] infection. With these 6
patients, at least 27 have so far been diagnosed
with dengue in the city 1-16 July [2008], said
Nasim-us-Seraj, the chief entomologist of Dhaka
City Corporation (DCC). Aside from the 6 patients
hospitalised yesterday, 15 others hospitalised
before are still undergoing treatment, he added.
Nasim said the 6 dengue patients who were
hospitalised yesterday live in different parts of the city.

However, no information regarding ther latest
detection of dengue cases was available at the
health directorate. An official at the control
room of the directorate yesterday said he was not
aware of any detection of dengue case this season
as the directorate did not "receive" any
information regarding it. DCC Chief Entomologist
Nasim said the DCC has been in close contact with
hospitals and clinics in the city since 1 July
[2008] to keep record of the dengue cases.

When asked what the DCC is doing following the
latest detection of the mosquito-borne disease,
he said, "We've already instructed our officials
at zonal offices to spray adulticide and
larvicide within a 500-yard perimeter of the
dwellings of the dengue-infected patients." The
DCC collects the addresses of the patients from
the hospitals that treat them, he added.

The DCC hopes to control dengue in the city by
raising awareness among the city residents, the
chief entomologist of DCC said adding that the
DCC has been creating awareness through
informative posters and announcements published
in daily newspapers. They also organise special
programmes at different schools as part of its
mass awareness campaign, he said. The DCC also
sought assistance from Real Estate and Housing
Association of Bangladesh (Rehab) in this regard, Nasim said.

The DCC has requested Rehab to ask its members to destroy discarded
water tanks or reservoirs and clean up any possible places in any
demolished or under construction buildings where water can stagnate
for over 5 days, he added. In the middle of the breeding season of
_Aedes_ mosquito, the carrier of the [virus], everyone needs to use
mosquito nets when going to bed, even during the daytime, he cautioned.

Entomologist Touhid Uddin Ahmed said since the present pattern of rain
creates suitable [conditions] for _Aedes_ mosquitoes to breed rapidly,
the authorities concerned should take precautionary measures.

People also have their responsibilities, he said elaborating that they
should keep their houses and yards clean and they should destroy any
type of pots or containers before throwing those in the garbage.
"People have the wrong idea that people once infected with dengue will
not be infected again. They should be more careful as they are under a
greater risk of catching haemorrhagic dengue," [resulting from a 2nd
infection. - Mod.JW] he warned.

A 2nd case of dengue was detected in the capital on Thursday [17 Jul
2008], within 24 hours of the 1st, triggering fears of an outbreak of
the disease. Sources told the Daily Times that the blood samples of
the patient had been tested positive for dengue at the National
Institute of Health (NIH). They said that the boy, 15, who is a
resident of Shakrial, had been shifted to the
isolation unit of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS).
[Dengue is not transmitted directly from person to person, therefore
isolation is not nercessary. However, if that unit is the only one
that is mosquito-proof, that is a sensible precaution to prevent him
infecting the vector. - Mod.JW].

A Frontier Constabulary (FC) soldier deployed in the capital's
Margalla barracks is already under treatment at the unit. He was
shifted there after
being tested positive for dengue. The sources said that another FC
soldier was also admitted to the Polyclinic. They said that the NIH
was expected to inform the hospital in a few days whether or not the
soldier carried [was infected by] the dengue virus.

Meanwhile, a Health Ministry spokesman said that the Capital
Development Authority had begun spraying insecticide in the city.

Member of Parliament Mohammed Al-Assali affirmed on Saturday [12 Jul
2008] that 4 individuals infected with dengue fever all died within a
week in Raymah and Hodeidah governorates. Ahmed Awadh, who heads
WHO's dengue fever center, told the U.N.'s IRIN news service that the
disease has claimed 5 lives so far because doctors were unaware of it
and therefore treated the patients as if it was a mere fever.

Sultan Al-Maqtari, manager of Hodeidah governorateÂ’s Epidemic
Recording Office, states that the office has discovered 12 cases of
those infected with dengue fever since the beginning of May [2008] and
that [samples from] another 112 individuals suspected of carrying
[having] the infection were taken to the central laboratory to be
checked for the disease.

Of the victims, 3, a mother and daughter and another woman, were from
Raymah governorate, while the 4th victim was a 4-year-old girl from
Hodeidah governorate.

Al-Maqtari noted that his office had conducted
anti-mosquito spraying in Dair Al-Atta and
Al-Rahmah villages, in addition to giving
residents the required preventive medicines. He
added that the team told residents about the
necessity of draining swamps and eliminating
stagnant open waters, which attract mosquitoes.
[Draining swamps, which are not breeding habitats
for the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes that transmit
dengue viruses, will not affect transmission of these viruses. - Mod.TY]

MP Ahmed Al-Dhubaibi urged YemenÂ’s Ministry of Health and Population
to assist citizens in Raymah governorate quickly, adding that a large
number of people in Al-Jabeen district have symptoms similar to those
of dengue fever. Earlier this month [July 2008], 180 new cases of
suspected dengue fever were reported in 5 governorates, 115 of which
were confirmed to be dengue fever sufferers.

According to a Health Ministry report, the total
number of dengue fever cases so far this year now
is approaching 2100. The report notes that the
disease, found in only 5 governorates last year
[2007] -Â­ Shabwa, Hodeidah, Abyan, Hadramout and
Lah -- has been discovered in 13 governorates this year [2008].

The ministry report states that the number of
confirmed cases in Hadramout increased from 64
last week to 87 this week, while in Shabwa, such
cases increased from 35 to 51, in addition to one
new case in Abyan, making 4 cases in that
governorate so far. According to the report,
Hodeidah and Lahj are witnessing fewer cases due
to awareness campaigns and insecticide spraying.

The report further mentions that the main reason for the diseaseÂ’s
spread is polluted water in open tanks and containers where mosquitoes
gather. It notes that the main way to prevent the disease in these
districts is to provide safe water sources. However, according to the
World Health Organization, some of these districts do have safe water
sources, but they are pumped irregularly, which causes citizens to
store water in tanks and open containers.
