[According to the media, "The Philippines will cull 200 000 chickens, quail and ducks after confirming the country's 1st outbreak of bird flu," Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pinol said on Friday [4 Aug 2017?].

The avian flu outbreak was detected in a farm in San Luis municipality in Pampanga province, north of the capital Manila, which later spread to 5 neighbouring farms. There has been no case of human transmission, although health officials are conducting checks on farm workers.

"We have declared a one-km quarantine radius with the epicenter being San Luis. All fowl found within the area will be culled and buried, and the estimated population is 200 000," Pinol told reporters at a news conference.

The volume of birds to be culled was half of Pinol's initial estimate of 400 000, which he said was based on a preliminary evaluation and was later revised after inspection.

The government's report on Friday [4 Aug 2017?] to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) described the flu virus in affected birds as an H5 subtype of highly pathogenic (high-path) avian influenza.

Initial tests ruled out high-path H5N1 as the virus strain, Dr. Celia Carlos told reporters, and samples will be sent to Australia for further testing.

"The Department of Health is doing surveillance of possible human cases, especially concentrating on people who have been exposed to the affected animals or poultry," Carlos said.

Culling should be completed within the next 3 days, said Pinol. The virus may have come from migratory birds from China or smuggled ducks, also from China, he said.

There were indications as early as April 2017 of bird flu hitting one farm, but the situation worsened in July 2017, with around 37 000 birds dying during the period, Pinol said.

The Philippines is the latest country in Asia, Europe and Africa where the bird flu viruses have spread in recent months. Many strains only infect birds, but the H7N9 strain has led to human cases, including fatalities, in China". See https://www.agcanada.com/daily/philippines-reports-first-avian-flu-outbreak.

Regarding Laos, during September 2016, Laos reported to the OIE one outbreak of HPAI H5N1. The outbreak was located in the province of Luangprabang. The event was declared resolved on 26 Oct 2016. See report and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=21176.
