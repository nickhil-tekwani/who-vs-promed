A 4-fold increase in polio has been reported in Nigeria, with the
disease spreading to other countries, a World Health Organisation
official says.

Forty-three cases were reported in Nigeria this year [2011], compared
to 11 last year [2010], the official, Thomas Moran, said.

Curbing the polio virus in Nigeria is key to eradicating the crippling
disease in Africa, he said.

In 2003, northern Nigeria's Muslim leaders opposed vaccinations,
claiming they could cause infertility.

Nigeria is one of 4 countries in the world -- along with Pakistan,
India, and Afghanistan -- where polio is still a major health risk.

Mr Moran told the BBC the disease had also spread to neighbouring
Niger, Mali, and Ivory Coast.

"The success of polio eradication in Africa rests on Nigeria
interrupting the virus," he said.

Polio was affecting 8 northern Nigerian states -- 2 more than a few
months ago, the head of Nigeria's National Primary Healthcare
Development Agency (NPHDA), Dr Ado Muhammad, told the BBC.

Mr Moran said the Nigerian government had shown "strong leadership" in
the campaign to eradicate polio and the WHO had been carrying out
large scale vaccination programmes to prevent the disease from
spreading.

"The immunity profile of Nigerian children is far better [now], which
limits the risk of international spread of the virus," Mr Moran said.
He also stressed that the number of children affected remained low.

"You can call it a 4-fold increase but it is still very low
transmission in a country as large as Nigeria with almost 50 [million]
children under 5 [years old]," he said.

At the Commonwealth summit last month [October 2011], the leaders of
Nigeria, Canada, the UK, and Australia pledged millions of dollars
towards the global effort to eradicate polio.

In 2003, the northern Nigerian state of Kano backed Muslim religious
leaders in opposing an immunisation programme, claiming it was a
Western plot to make people infertile. Health experts say this led to
many people becoming infected by polio.

The clerics and the state government later dropped their opposition to
the immunisation programme.

In 2007, there was a rare outbreak of a vaccine-derived form of polio
in northern Nigeria.

It affected 69 children who had been vaccinated.

Case count as of 16 Nov 2011:
Total cases: Year-to-date 2011 / Year-to-date 2010 / Total in 2010
Globally: 520 / 789 / 1352

Countries reporting new cases during past week
----------------------------------------------
- Endemic countries
Afghanistan
Six cases were reported in the past week [week ending 16 Nov 2011],
all wild poliovirus type 1 [WPV1]. The total number of cases for 2011
is now 53. 3 of the cases reported this week are in districts which
had not previously reported a case this year -- Barmal district in
Paktika province, Shahidi Hassas district in Uruzgan province, and
Daychopan in Zabul province. The case reported in Paktika is the 1st
case in the entire province for 2011. Afghanistan's most recent case
had onset of paralysis on [22 Oct 2011] (in Maywand district, Kandahar
province).

Pakistan
Nine new cases were reported in the past week (all WPV1s), from
Balochistan, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa (KP), and Sindh, bringing the total number of cases for
2011 to 145. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [19 Oct
2011] (WPV1 from KP).

[No new cases reported for the week ending 16 Nov 2011 in Nigeria and
India]

- Non-endemic countries
No new cases reported from any of the countries with 2011 transmission
-- Angola, Chad, Central African Republic, China, Democratic Republic

[The newswire discussion in [1] on the polio situation in Nigeria is a
deja vu for discussions back in 2004 through 2006 when Nigeria was the
leading exporter of wild poliovirus to other countries in Africa, and
subsequently outside of Africa (Indonesia) (see prior ProMED-mail
posts listed below). It is sad that the situation continues to the
present, with continued transmission of the WPV (types 1 and 3) and
re-seeding of countries that had interrupted WPV transmission for 2 or
more years.

Of note, the newswire on the situation in Nigeria mentions there had
been a significant outbreak of polio due to infection with circulating
vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV) in Nigeria in 2007 involving 69
children. In fact, cVDPV associated polio continues to be a problem in
Nigeria, with 71 cases reported in 2007, 66 cases reported in 2008,
154 cases reported in 2009, 27 cases reported in 2010, and 20 cases
reported in 2011 as of 15 Nov 2011
(http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Circulatingvaccinederivedpoliovirus.aspx).
As mentioned in prior ProMED-mail posts on reported cases of polio
associated with cVDPV, these cases tend to occur in areas with
inadequate vaccination coverages, further supporting the observation
that vaccination coverages in Nigeria are suboptimal. The continued
circulation of VDPVs contributes to rumors that the vaccine is
damaging children, continuing the cycle of vaccine refusal.

In terms of absolute numbers of cases of polio, the countries with the
most reported cases in decreasing order are: Pakistan (145 cases),
Chad (117), DR Congo (86), Afghanistan (53), Nigeria (42) and Cote
d'Ivoire (36). Pakistan has reported almost 1/3 of all cases reported
in 2011, with transmission documented throughout the country. (For
