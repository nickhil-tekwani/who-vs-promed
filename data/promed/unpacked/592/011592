Abstract
--------
The current pandemic influenza A H1N1 2009 (pH1N1) was first
recognized in humans with acute respiratory diseases in April 2009 in
Mexico, in swine in Canada in June 2009 with respiratory disease, and
in turkeys in Chile in June 2009 with a severe drop in egg production
[see ProMED 2009 refs. below]. Several experimental studies attempted
to reproduce the disease in turkeys, but failed to produce respiratory
infection in turkeys using standard inoculation routes. We
demonstrated that pH1N1 virus can infect the reproductive tract of
turkey hens after experimental intrauterine inoculation, causing
decreased egg production. This route of exposure is realistic in
modern turkey production because turkey hens are handled once a week
for intrauterine insemination in order to produce fertile eggs. This
understanding of virus exposure provides an improved understanding of
the pathogenesis of the disease and can improve poultry husbandry to
prevent disease outbreaks.

[H1N1 has been, so far, officially reported from turkey farms in 4
countries: Chile (July 2009), Canada (October 2009), USA (Virginia,
November 2009; California, December 2009), and France (Jan 2010) --
see ProMED rafs. below. All those events related to breeding flocks
where artificial insemination is practiced. It appears that
intracloacal and intrauterine routes are the only way to infect
turkeys with the influenza pandemic (H1N1) virus. The finding of the
authors above, at the Exotic and Emerging Avian Viral Diseases
Research Unit, Agricultural Research Service, US Department of
Agriculture, Athens, Georgia is unambiguous and leads to practical,
applicable consequences to prevent such infections.

Note that "swine influenza" (hog flu, pig flu) sensu stricto, an
animal disease caused by a specific porcine virus, namely swine
influenza virus (SIV; not H1N1), is known to sporadically cause
disease in turkeys (and humans). When it occurs, it is not followed by
further spread in the affected populations ("dead end" hosts). - Mod.AS]
