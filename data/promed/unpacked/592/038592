South Australia Health is urging parents to vaccinate their children against whooping cough as cases in South Australia reach a 4-year high.

New figures from SA Health reveal that the number of whooping cough cases are rising, up from a total of 505 cases in 2014 compared to 985 cases so far in 2015. In 2013, 820 people were reported to have whooping cough, and in 2012, 922 were struck with the disease. Numbers in SA peaked in 2010, when a whopping 7520 had the disease.

Whooping cough is easily spread when an infected person talks, coughs or sneezes. SA Health public health physician and pediatrician Associate Professor Nicola Spurrier urged parents to vaccinate their children, who were most vulnerable to contracting the disease. "There is a new booster vaccine recommended for pregnant women in their 3rd trimester of pregnancy that provides protection for the mother and also for the baby when it is born."

Parents are being warned to be on the lookout for symptoms of the potentially life-threatening whooping cough, as Blacktown Mt Druitt Hospital has recorded an increase of more than 450 per cent since this time in 2014.

More than 1200 cases of whooping cough were reported across western Sydney during 2015, with 200 cases reported in October 2015 alone. In 2014, only 400 cases were reported. This October 2015, more than 95 cases were reported in the Blacktown local government area, compared with just 21 cases in October 2014.

Western Sydney Local Health District Communicable diseases manager Dr Shopna Bag said cases of whooping cough had been consistently increasing. "Western Sydney Local Health District has experienced a steady increase in pertussis (whooping cough) notifications since late 2014."

Regular immunization is recommended to prevent whooping cough, with all children receiving immunisation in high school; however, immunity fades over time, and booster shots are often needed for adults.

Dr Bag said the increase in cases in western Sydney could be put down to lack of immunization. "Immunity [from] the whooping cough vaccination fades over time," Dr Bag said. After 3 or 4 years, there are enough people in the community with low levels of immunity to allow an outbreak to occur."

Pertussis is particularly dangerous for newborn babies, who may not show symptoms of a cough but may stop breathing and turn blue. To combat this risk to newborns, the NSW Government introduced the Antenatal Pertussis Vaccination program in April 2015. The program offers free vaccinations for all pregnant women in their 3rd trimester to protect children before they are born.

[Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe, with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different, with periods of apnea [breathing arrest] sometimes with hypoxia-induced [low oxygen] seizures, usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000 and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs for mortality.

In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental oxygen in the hospital and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care.

A 2014 publication confirms the safety of maternal pertussis immunization: Kharbanda EO, Vazquez-Benitez G, Lipkind HS, et al: Evaluation of the association of maternal pertussis vaccination with obstetric events and birth outcomes.
