British Columbia has recorded its 1st case in 2016 of someone being sickened by eating raw oysters contaminated with vibrio bacteria. The BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) said the illness was reported on 30 Jun 2016 in the Vancouver area.

_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ grows in seawater and can end up in shellfish such as oysters and clams. When water temperatures rise in the summer, the accumulations of the naturally occurring bacteria increase to the point that eating undercooked shellfish can give people nausea, fever and diarrhea.

2015's outbreak of the vibrio-caused illness was the biggest in Canadian history and sickened at least 73 British Columbians. 60 of the illnesses were due to eating contaminated raw or undercooked BC oysters in restaurants. The other 13 illnesses were traced to exposure to seawater with high levels of the bacteria.

At the height of the outbreak last summer [2015], Vancouver Coastal Health ordered restaurants not to serve raw oysters harvested from BC waters, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency issued a food recall for BC oysters.

"Eating raw shellfish increases your risk of vibrio and other infections," said Dr. Eleni Galanis, epidemiologist at the BCCDC, in a release. "It's best to eat them cooked, but if you choose to eat raw shellfish like oysters, then understand the risks and take steps to reduce your likelihood of illness."

[It is important to stress that _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ is naturally present in marine waters and does not imply sewage contamination, as would be the case with _Salmonella_ sp. or _Escherichia coli_. It is commonest in warmer waters such as those of the American Gulf Coast, but warmer waters in more northern climates such as in Washington State, Alaska and British Columbia, accentuated by global warming, can also be associated with shellfish-associated _V. parahaemolyticus_.

Indeed, eating raw shellfish only during months containing an "r" in its name may decrease eating them during the warmer months (May, June, July, and August), but only in the Northern Hemisphere (it should be reversed below the equator). However, since global warming has occurred, and with the shellfish being shipped quickly from warmer to colder areas, the old adage is not very helpful anymore. - Mod.LL
