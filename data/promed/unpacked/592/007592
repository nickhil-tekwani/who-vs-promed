[Case count information as of 9 pm EDT, 16 Jul 2008]
CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states, the
Indian Health Service, and the FDA (US Food & Drug Administration) to
investigate an ongoing multistate outbreak of human _Salmonella [enterica_]
serotype Saintpaul infections. An initial epidemiologic investigation in
New Mexico and Texas comparing foods eaten by persons who were ill in May
2008 to foods eaten by well persons identified consumption of raw tomatoes
as strongly linked to illness. A similar but much larger, nationwide study
comparing persons who were ill in June 2008 to well persons found that ill
persons were more likely to have recently consumed raw tomatoes, fresh
jalapeno peppers, and fresh cilantro. These items were commonly, though not
always, consumed together, so that study could not determine which item(s)
caused the illnesses.

Recently, many clusters of illnesses have been identified in several states
among persons who ate at restaurants. Most clusters involve fewer than 5
ill persons. Three larger clusters have been intensively investigated. In
one, illnesses were linked to consumption of an item containing fresh
tomatoes and fresh jalapeno peppers. In the other 2, illnesses were linked
to an item containing fresh jalapeno peppers and no other of the suspect
items. The accumulated data from all investigations indicate that jalapeno
peppers caused some illnesses but that they do not explain all illnesses.
Raw tomatoes, fresh serrano peppers, and fresh cilantro also remain under
investigation. Investigators from many agencies are collaborating to track
the source of the implicated peppers and other produce items.

Since April 2008, 1220 persons infected with _S._ Saintpaul with the same
genetic fingerprint have been identified in 42 states, the District of
Columbia, and Canada. These were identified because clinical laboratories
in all states send strains from ill persons to their State public health
laboratory for characterization. No new states report ill persons. The
number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Alabama (2
persons), Arkansas (16), Arizona (54), California (9), Colorado (16),
Connecticut (4), Florida (2), Georgia (28), Idaho (6), Illinois (113),
Indiana (16), Iowa (2), Kansas (18), Kentucky (2), Louisiana (1), Maine
(1), Maryland (36), Massachusetts (26), Michigan (24), Minnesota (22),
Mississippi (2), Missouri (17), New Hampshire (5), Nevada (12), New Jersey
(12), New Mexico (102), New York (32), North Carolina (23), Ohio (10),
Oklahoma (25), Oregon (10), Pennsylvania (12), Rhode Island (3), South
Carolina (2), Tennessee (9), Texas (474), Utah (2), Virginia (31), Vermont
(2), Washington (17), West Virginia (1), Wisconsin (13), and the District
of Columbia (1). Five ill persons are reported from Canada; 4 appear to
have been infected while traveling in the USA, and one illness remains
under investigation.

Among the 1167 persons with information available, illnesses began between
10 Apr 2008 and 4 Jul 2008, including 625 who became ill on 1 Jun 2008 or
later. These numbers include those with estimated onset dates as well as
those with reported onset dates. Patients range in age from less than 1 to
99 years; 50 per cent are female. The rate of illness is highest among
persons 20 to 29 years old; the rate of illness is lowest in children 5 to
19 years old and in persons 80 or more years old. At least 224 persons were
hospitalized. A man in his 80s who died in Texas from cardiopulmonary
failure had an infection with the outbreak strain at the time of his death;
the infection may have contributed to his death. A man in his 60s who died
in Texas from cancer had an infection with the outbreak strain of at the
time of his death; the infection may have contributed to his death.

The outbreak can be visually described with a chart showing the number of
persons who became ill each day. This chart is called an epidemic curve or
epi curve. The epi curve and information about interpreting it may be found
[at the source URL - Mod.LL]. It shows that the number of persons who
became ill peaked during May 2008 and decreased in June 2008. The average
number of persons who became ill between 20 May 2008 and 10 Jun 2008 was 33
per day. The average number of persons who became ill between 11 Jun 2008
and 20 Jun 2008 was 19 per day. Illnesses that occurred after 20 Jun 2008
may not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person
becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2-3
weeks. The outbreak appears to be ongoing, but with fewer new illnesses
each day.

[Since ProMED-mail's last posting on this outbreak with data through 7 Jul
2008, 229 additional cases have been linked to the implicated strain of
_S._ Saintpaul, one more state is involved (Mississippi), and 350 more
cases have occurred in June 2008 or later. To date, 625/1220 (51 per cent)
of all cases had the onset of illness essentially after the announcement of
the tomato risk. In addition, one more case has been reported from Canada
(but it is not known if it was acquired in Canada or the USA). - Mod.LL]

It's OK to eat all kinds of tomatoes again, the American government
declared on Thu 17 Jul 2008, lifting its salmonella warning on the summer
favorites amid signs that the record outbreak, while not over, may finally
be slowing.

Hot peppers still get a caution: the people most at risk of salmonella
[infection], including the elderly and people with weak immune systems,
should avoid fresh jalapenos and serranos, and any dishes that may contain
them such as fresh salsa, federal health officials advised.

Investigators still don't know what caused the salmonella outbreak, which
now has sickened 1220 people in 42 states. But Thursday's [17 Jul 2008]
move, coming as the tomato industry estimates its losses at more than USD
100 million, doesn't mean that tomatoes harvested in the spring are
cleared. It just means that the tomatoes in fields and stores today are
safe to eat, said Dr David Acheson, the Food and Drug Administration's
(FDA) food safety chief.

"This is not saying that anybody was absolved," Acheson said. But, "as of
today [18 Jul 2008], FDA officials believe that consumers may now enjoy all
types of fresh tomatoes available without concern of becoming infected with
_Salmonella_ Saintpaul," the outbreak strain.

Early on, there was good evidence linking certain raw tomatoes to the sick,
Acheson stressed. Yet inspectors haven't found the outbreak strain, in
suspect areas of south Florida and parts of Mexico, where they've managed
to trace tomatoes thought to have been eaten by patients.

As the outbreak stretched into June 2008, more evidence emerged against
fresh jalapenos, the FDA's hottest lead for now. The agency sent inspectors
to a Mexican packing house that supplied peppers linked to a cluster of
those illnesses. Also still on the suspect list is fresh cilantro.

Separately, on Thursday [17 Jun 2008], North Carolina officials who were
investigating some _S._ Saintpaul cases linked to a Charlotte-area
restaurant announced a recall of jalapenos and avocados shipped to that
state from a Texas food supply company. More tests are needed to see if the
salmonella found in 2 samples is the outbreak strain, or another variety.

For every salmonella case the CDC confirms, it estimates there are 30 to 40
more that go undocumented, perhaps because people don't see a doctor or
undergo the right testing.

How could 2 different types of produce be contaminated with what is a rare
type of salmonella? One possibility is that a large farm grew tomatoes in
one section and peppers in another, and both went through a common washing
station with contaminated water, Acheson said. "Bear in mind this is not
following the trail of a regular old produce outbreak," he said. "There's
something else going on here that is a little unusual."

[It certainly appears that multiple vehicles may be involved that have been
cross-contaminated along the food chain. When such vehicles are often eaten
together, it becomes much more difficult to sort out the epidemiology. -
