Pilot implementation of 1st malaria vaccine recommended by WHO advisory group
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) and the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC) jointly recommended pilot projects to understand how to best use a vaccine that protects against malaria in young children.

"This was a historic meeting with 2 of WHO's major advisory committees working together to consider current evidence about this vaccine," said Professor Fred Binka, acting chair of MPAC. "The committees agreed that pilot implementations should be the next step with this vaccine."

The vaccine, known as RTS,S, is the 1st vaccine for malaria, but there is one primary question. It requires 4 doses for a child to be fully protected and therefore requires additional contacts with the health care system. The 1st 3 doses are given one month apart followed by an 18-month pause before the 4th dose. Without the 4th dose, children had no overall reduction in severe malaria.

"The question about how the malaria vaccine may best be delivered still need to be answered," said Professor Jon S Abramson, chair of SAGE. "After detailed assessment of all the evidence we recommended that this question is best addressed by having 3-5 large pilot implementation projects."

The malaria vaccine, RTS,S, acts against _Plasmodium falciparum_, the most deadly malaria parasite globally, and the most prevalent in Africa. It offers no protection against _P. vivax_ malaria, which predominates in many countries outside of Africa.

The vaccine is being assessed as a complementary malaria control tool that could potentially be added to -- but not replace -- the core package of proven malaria preventive, diagnostic, and treatment measures.

[It is a wise step by the WHO to test the RTS,S vaccine in carefully planned pilot studies. The RTS,S schedule is not easily synchronized with the childhood immunization program and pilot sites, thus, would need extra funding, both for performing the immunization and also for careful follow up of immunized children.

One major problem with the RTS,S trials performed so far is that the studies have not provided any data on mortality, thus, we still do not know if immunization with RTS,S reduces mortality from malaria. Therefore, a major endpoint in the pilot testing of RTS,S needs to be the mortality from malaria, so the pilot sites must include enough patients to answer this question. In addition, the protocols in different centers must allow comparison of data pooled from the different centers.

So far, the protective efficacy of the RTS,S vaccine is less than that of insecticide treated nets (ITNs). Thus, comparative studies between RTS,S and ITNs is badly needed. This could be performed in areas where ITNs were used as routine intervention and individuals offered RTS,S or placebo in a randomized controlled trial. - Mod.EP]

[Acccording to the FAQ available from the Malaria Vaccine Initiative and PATH:
"RTS,S is a scientific name given to this malaria vaccine candidate and represents its composition. The 'R' stands for the central repeat region of Plasmodium (P.) falciparum 'circumsporozoite protein (CSP); the 'T' for the T-cell epitopes of the CSP; and the 'S' for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). These are combined in a single fusion protein ('RTS') and co-expressed in yeast cells with free HBsAg. The 'RTS' fusion protein and free 'S' protein spontaneously assemble in 'RTS,S' particles."
