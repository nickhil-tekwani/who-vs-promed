Evidence of Influenza A Virus RNA in Siberian Lake Ice
-----------------------------------------------
[The following report published in the December 2006 issue of the
Journal of Virology describes observations that identify a potential
abiotic reservoir for influenza A virus that could play a role both
in the transmission of influenza virus by migratory birds and
represent a previously unrecognized source of both antigenic
variation and pathogenic potential, with relevance for the
epidemiology of both animal and human influenza. - Mod.CP]

Lake Ice" is authored by Gang Zhang, 1 Dany Shoham, 2 David

The authors in their summary state that: "Influenza A virus infects a
large proportion of the human population annually, sometimes leading
to the deaths of millions. The biotic cycles of infection are well
characterized in the literature, including in studies of populations
of humans, poultry, swine, and migratory waterfowl. However, there
are few studies of abiotic reservoirs for this virus. Here, we report
the preservation of influenza A virus genes in ice and water from
high-latitude lakes that are visited by large numbers of migratory
birds. The lakes are along the migratory flight paths of birds flying
into Asia, North America, Europe, and Africa. The data suggest that
influenza A virus, deposited as the birds begin their autumn
migration, can be preserved in lake ice. As birds return in the
spring, the ice melts, releasing the viruses. Therefore, temporal
gene flow is facilitated between the viruses shed during the previous
year and the viruses newly acquired by birds during winter months
spent in the south. Above the Arctic Circle, the cycles of entrapment
in the ice and release by melting can be variable in length, because
some ice persists for several years, decades, or longer. This type of
temporal gene flow might be a feature common to viruses that can
survive entrapment in environmental ice and snow."
