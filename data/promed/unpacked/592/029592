Alberta game farmer helps to find new CWD case 6 Nov 2002
--------------
A recent laboratory submission from a whitetail deer farm enabled the
detection of a new positive case of chronic wasting disease (CWD) on
a whitetail farm in Alberta. This is the first case of CWD in a
farmed whitetail in Canada. This discovery highlights the successful
cooperation between the industry, Alberta Agriculture, Food and Rural
Development (AAFRD) and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
In Alberta, the Chronic Wasting Disease Surveillance Program has been
mandatory since July 2002. It was previously voluntary since 1996.
AAFRD in cooperation with the Alberta Whitetail and Mule Deer
Association and the Alberta Elk Association established this program.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency Eradication Program was been in
place since October 2000 and was also established through close
cooperation with the deer and elk farming industry.
This new farm represents the 42nd farm where CWD was identified in
Canada and only the 2nd in Alberta. In Saskatchewan 4 cases of
chronic wasting disease were also confirmed in wild mule deer and are
unrelated to this case in farmed whitetail deer. As a result of the
new case, 2 whitetail deer farms have been quarantined and a
temporary 2-week moratorium on movements of farmed whitetails and
mule deer was put in place as part of the herd investigation. This
moratorium does not include whitetail or mule deer going directly for
slaughter, as all meat is held pending a negative CWD test.
Scientific observations to date suggest CWD is more similar to
scrapie than to other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
(TSEs). Scrapie is a disease of sheep that has been recognized for
hundreds of years and that has never been associated with disease in
humans. Health Canada is in agreement with the World Health
Organization's (WHO) current position that there is no evidence to
indicate that CWD affects humans.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), the Provincial Government
and the cervid industry have established the most extensive and rigid
disease regulations and policies of all agricultural sectors.
Some regulations require:
Individual identification of all animals on farms
Annual inventory and recording of all births and deaths and movement
Registration of each animal
Transportation authorization permits are required for all movement of
farmed cervids
Chronic wasting disease is a reportable disease
Specific fencing requirements to contain game farm animals and exclude wildlife
