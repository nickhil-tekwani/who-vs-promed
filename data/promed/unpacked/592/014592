The mystery fever continues to elude civic authorities and experts. A
Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) [West Bengal] team, which visited
3 blocks in New Alipore, from where it had been reported, failed to
confirm either chikungunya or dengue [virus infections] on Thursday [8
Dec 2011]. Even though the symptoms are close to both diseases,
hundreds suffering from the fever have not been confirmed to be
suffering from either. Cases have been reported from upmarket areas of
Alipore, New Alipore, Chetla, Behala, and parts of Tollygunge.

"Our team spoke to the victims' families and collected blood samples.
Tests have not revealed dengue or chikungunya [virus infections]. So,
it's obviously the mystery fever. We are keeping a tab on the
situation," said a civic health official.

For the last 3 weeks, KMC clinics and city hospitals have been flooded
with patients suffering from high fever and excruciating joint pain.
Most have also had body rashes, headache, and numbness in the limbs.
Blood tests, however, have not confirmed either chikungunya or dengue
[virus infections]. "The symptoms appear to be somewhere in between
the two diseases. While the joint pain points at chikungunya, body
rashes seem to suggest dengue. But it's probably neither of the 2.
Instead, it's more likely to be one of those mystery fevers which have
been striking Kolkata frequently this year [2011]," said paediatrician
Shantanu Ray, who himself suffered a bout of the undetected fever last
month. On Thursday [8 Dec 2011], state industries minister Partha
Chatterjee was admitted to a private hospital with fever. He was later
diagnosed as suffering from viral infection.

Civic officials interacted with a few senior doctors in the New
Alipore-Behala area on Thursday [8 Dec 2011]. They collected data and
case histories. "The idea is to follow up and get tests done to detect
if these are chikungunya or dengue. So far, we have not been able to
confirm any disease. The vigil will continue," said Atin Ghosh, MMiC
(health).

The KMC has sent blood samples to the School of Tropical Medicine,
ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research], and even to a WHO
laboratory. Reports are yet to reach the KMC. "Civic officials spoke
to me about the mystery fever and sought my help. They seem to be
taking an initiative to check the disease, whatever it might be. Let
us hope the spread of this fever will be checked," said Tarun
Praharaj, a resident of New Alipore.

[With dengue and chikungunya viruses ruled out, it is difficult to
determine which pathogen might be the cause of these cases.
Accordingly, ProMED-mail consulted with Dr Steve Berger
(<mberger@post.tau.ac.il>) who replied that he, "ran the following
past Gideon (Global Infectious Disease & Epidemiology Network;
http://www.GideonOnline.com: Large outbreak, India, Fever, Rash,
Joint pain, Headache"
The differential list contains 40 diseases, with highest ranking given
to enterovirus infection, followed by chikungunya and dengue.
Less likely -- but compatible diseases -- include:
Endemic typhus
Rubella
Parvovirus B19 infection
Hantavirus
Measles
Leptospirosis
West Nile fever
Relapsing fever
Q-fever
Old-world phleboviruses
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
Brucellosis
Ornithosis
Bunyaviridae infection

Gideon indicates that additional findings which would significantly
focus the differential diagnosis include presence of lymphadenopathy,
nature of the rash, or history of common animal/food exposure. The
program also lists several diseases, which are clinically compatible,
but heretofore not reported in India. The most interesting of these
are Zika virus, ehrlichiosis, and anaplasmosis."

ProMED thanks Dr Berger for providing the information above. It is
obvious that laboratory tests will be critical to determine what is
going on in this outbreak.
