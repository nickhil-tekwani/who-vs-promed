Yesterday [28 Aug 2014], 2 new cases of [a] hantavirus [infection] were confirmed by the Ministry of Health in Los Santos [province], one in San Jose de Las Tablas and the other in Tonosi.

Nahir Cedeno, Regional Health Director in Los Santos, stated that these cases were a 27-year-old young man and a 70-year-old man, both of whom currently are in intensive care in the Joaquin Pablo Franco Hospital in Las Tablas.

Cedeno indicated that to date 47 cases are registered, of whom 25 had developed hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS] and 22 are [just] febrile cases.

As well, Cedeno said that there are 500 silos (containers) to store grain in Tonosi, but for now only 42 have been distributed, since they are verifying, house by house, if 1 or 2 silos are needed, according to the people's needs.

[Cases of hantavirus infection continue to pop up in Los Santos province, especially in Tonosi and San Jose de Las Tablas, which appear to be focal areas of infection. Interestingly, only slightly half of the confirmed cases are of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), with the remaining cases without severe and acute pulmonary complications. This could mean that the members of the general public are aware of the risk of severe infections, and seek medical attention promptly.

Although the hantavirus involved in these cases is not specified, the one most likely responsible is Choclo virus, which is endemic in Los Santos province. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive no. 20130204.1527935, of the 3 hantaviruses known to occur in Panama, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing HPS, and can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to the hospital late in the course of their disease. No specific ecological details are provided concerning the environment where these 2 patients may have acquired their infections, but the mention of grain availability as a contributory factor in the appearance of cases is due to the relationship of these crops to the presence of rodent hosts of Choclo virus. That is why grain storage containers are being distributed in these endemic areas as a preventive measure.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
