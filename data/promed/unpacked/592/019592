Information on the genomic characterization of African swine fever virus
isolate from Georgia
-----------------------------------------------------
African swine fever virus (ASFV) samples were received from Georgia on 2
Jun 2007 by the ASFV OIE Reference Laboratory at the Institute for Animal
Health Pirbright Laboratory UK and were confirmed positive on 3 Jun 2007
and reported to both the Georgians and OIE on 4 Jun 2007.
Sequence analysis of 2 genome fragments (3' end of the p72 gene and central
variable region of the B602L gene) has now been completed. This analysis
showed that the Georgia 2007 ASFV outbreak was caused by the introduction
of a virus belonging to a genotype (Genotype II, Lubisi et al, 2005)
previously identified to contain isolates obtained from domestic pigs,
isolated between 1993 and 2002, in Mozambique and Zambia in the eastern
part of southern Africa and isolates introduced into Madagascar when ASFV
spread to the island in 1998.
Since very few ASFV samples are submitted for genotyping it is possible
that viruses belonging to this genotype may be more widespread. However, it
seems likely that the source of infection is from the eastern side of
southern Africa rather than west or central Africa or Sardinia.

[Drs Oura and Dixon are gratefully acknowledged for this 1st-hand,
authoritative information. The OIE ASF reference laboratory at Pirbright
deserves to be warmly commended for the expediency of its handling of this
case; notably, the samples were received from Georgia on a Saturday (2 Jun
2007) and the diagnosis was obtained during the same weekend, namely on
Sunday, and promptly reported.
It may be reminded that initial tests, carried in Georgia for ASF in
April/May 2007, were -- reportedly -- found negative. We take the liberty
to recommend that other countries, experiencing unusual disease occurrence
in swine, will follow Georgia's example and submit samples for confirmation
to one of OIE's reference laboratories even if initial tests in national
laboratories are found negative. - Mod.AS].
