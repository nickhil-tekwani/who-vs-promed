Downpour helps spread cane streak disease
-----------------------------------------
Heavy wet seasons in the Mackay region mean cane farmers are battling
the return of an elusive crop disease. The BSES [Bureau of Sugar
Experiment Stations] is visiting growers in the region to discuss
how chlorotic streak disease can be identified and avoided.

Chlorotic streak was discovered 70 years ago and appears as irregular
creamy-white streaks in the leaves and short, red streaks through the stalks.

Plant pathologist Dr Rob Magarey says it is not known what causes the
disease, but we know it is spread through water. "The causal agent,
whatever it is, is spread through floodwater, so you can have
flooding and it can spread the disease to previously unaffected
areas," he said. "It also tends to occur in water logged areas or
areas where there is poor drainage and even in areas which are
irrigated where they recycle their irrigation water."

[Chlorotic streak (CSD) of sugarcane is a disease of unknown
etiology. It is widespread in many areas worldwide and was first
recognised in 1929. So far, research has failed to identify a causal
agent though limited evidence points to a virus. Symptoms include
white to yellow, often fragmented leaf streaks with uneven margins,
followed by leaf necrosis, reddish necrosis of vascular tissue in
stalk nodes, and stunting of plants. Germination of seedcanes may be
reduced. Yield losses of up to 25 percent have been reported,
depending on the cane cultivar. Symptoms may be transient since
expression is dependent on environmental factors such as temperature
and high soil moisture, and this may make diagnosis difficult.

CSD is favoured by high rainfall and/or poor drainage and the
incidence is affected by the weather conditions during the previous
year. Transmission occurs via planting material, contaminated soil,
and water. The disease agent does not appear to survive in
subterranean aquifers such as bores. Some disease control is achieved
by placing seedcane sources in water heated to 50 deg C (122 deg F)
for up to 3 hours, but rapid reinfection of seedcanes in the field
may occur. Meristem tissue culture was successfully used to eliminate
CSD from seedcane lines.

In Australia, up to 50 000 ha (124 acres) may be affected annually
and highly productive varieties used widely are highly susceptible
and may collapse under heavy disease pressure.
