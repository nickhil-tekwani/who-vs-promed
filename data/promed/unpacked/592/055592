Medical Technician Blamed for Spread of Hepatitis C Infection
-------------------------------------------------------------
A medical technician with a cut on his finger accidentally infected 5
hospital patients with hepatitis C virus in the first documented case of
its kind, German researchers say. The researchers would not identify the
hospital nor where it was located.
The case involving the technician is the first documented instance of
hepatitis C virus being transmitted to patients by medical personnel who
are not physicians [surgeons or anesthetists, said Dr. R. Stefan Ross of
the University of Essen. He and colleagues reported the case in Thursday's
issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. The researchers blamed a
technician, whose job was to assist the anesthetist [in administering
anesthesia. They said he probably passed the virus from a cut on his
finger. He normally did not wear gloves, saying that they diminished the
sense of touch he needed for his work.
Hepatitis C is a viral disease of the liver that can cause jaundice,
fatigue, pain and vomiting. It can lead to serious liver damage and
cancer. About 4 million Americans [have contracted hepatitis C virus
infection.
In the German case, the technician himself apparently contracted the virus
from a patient during surgery in 1998. Within 6 weeks, he helped
administer anesthesia to 5 other patients, all of whom developed hepatitis
C. Genotypic analysis confirmed that the technician was the source of the
virus. Ross estimated the chances of such infection at 140 for every 1
million invasive procedures. He said that patients should not be concerned
about having any medical treatments because such events are very rare.
