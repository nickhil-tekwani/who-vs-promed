[Anthrax is sporadic in Sicily but is of the same strain seen in southern Italy, probably reflecting a common source when this region belonged to Spain. Antonio Fasanella tells me that he is continuing to work on identifying a possible source for the outbreaks in Basilicata.

It has been pointed out to me that presently in Europe, thanks to the problems generated by mad cow disease, all cattle protein feeds are carefully supervised and that bone meal is no longer used. I apologise for my error. - Mod.MHJ
