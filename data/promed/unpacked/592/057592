Honduras: State of Emergency Declared
-------------------------------------
TEGUCIGALPA: The president of Honduras declared a state of emergency on Thu
4 Jul 2002 in 5 of the country's 18 provinces because of an outbreak of
dengue hemorrhagic fever, which has killed 5 children this year. President
Ricardo Maduro said the measure applies to Valle and La Paz provinces
bordering El Salvador; the provinces of Choluteca and Olancho, which border
Nicaragua; and Cortes province bordering Guatemala. The state of emergency
was also in effect in the Central District, which includes the capital,
Tegucigalpa, a city of 1.4 million, where 5 young people died of the
illness between February and June 2002.
Health Minister Elias Lizardo told the press that several government
agencies, humanitarian groups such as the Red Cross, the armed forces, and
the private sector would join the campaign to stop the spread of the
disease. Lizardo also urged the media to raise public awareness of
preventive measures, such as eliminating pools of standing water that can
serve as breeding grounds for the mosquitoes that transmit the disease.
The Public Health Ministry has reported some 135 cases of dengue
hemorrhagic fever -- the deadliest form of the disease -- and about 3400
cases of classic dengue so far this year. In neighboring El Salvador, at
least 7 children have died of dengue hemorrhagic fever so far in 2002.

Central America: Dengue Fever Has Killed 15 Children This Year
--------------------------------------------------------------
TEGUCIGALPA: Authorities are stepping up efforts to fight an outbreak of
dengue hemorrhagic fever in Central America that has killed 15 children in
El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. In Honduras the sixth victim, an
8-year-old child, died in Tegucigalpa on Fri 5 Jul 2002 at a hospital run
by the Honduran Social Security Institute. Some 10 000 cases of classic
dengue fever and 400 of the deadlier dengue hemorrhagic fever have been
reported in Central America so far this year, most of them in Honduras and
El Salvador.
In the past 3 weeks, the 3 countries where fatalities have been recorded
declared states of emergency, as neighboring countries rushed to offer aid.
Guatemala, El Salvador, and Costa Rica have offered to aid Honduras, on the
heels of Cuba, which sent 2 specialists to supplement the health care
professionals who have been working in the country's most isolated regions
since late 1998, in the wake of Hurricane Mitch. Mexico 2 weeks ago sent a
brigade of doctors and technicians to El Salvador, where 1575 cases of
classic dengue and 122 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever have been reported.
The Guatemalan Defense Minister Gen. Alvaro Mendez on Thu 4 Jul 2002
announced that his country would send an army contingent to Honduras next
week to help fight the outbreak there. "We are sending 3 or 4 army
fumigation units," Mendez said in Tegucigalpa, where he was attending the
ninth meeting of the Supreme Council of the Conference of Central American
Armed Forces (C-FAC). El Salvador will provide Honduras with medical and
technical information on combating dengue outbreaks, Salvadoran Deputy
Health Minister Herbert Betancourt said on Fri 6 Jul 2002. "We are
processing samples to learn the serotypes they have there and begin helping
them with what we have in place," he said.
El Salvador's mosquito larvae index has decreased substantially after 3
weeks of intense house-to-house spraying and educating the population on
how to destroy environments in which mosquitoes, the disease's vectors,
breed. Aerial spraying of the municipalities of Soyapango and Ilopango,
south of San Salvador, was completed on Fri 6 Jul 2002 and may be repeated
in other areas as warranted, officials said.
In Nicaragua, the Health Ministry has confirmed 494 cases of classic dengue
and 65 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever this year among 1800 people
exhibiting associated symptoms.
In Costa Rica, where no deaths have been reported, the figure is 2261
cases, of which only one was the hemorrhagic form.
In Panama, authorities have reported 400 cases of classic dengue and one of
dengue hemorrhagic fever.
In Guatemala, with the lowest prevalence in the region, the Public Health
and Social Welfare Ministry reported only 71 cases, all of classic dengue,
among 1098 suspected victims.
The rains lashing Central America since May 2002 have contributed to a
proliferation of the _Aedes egypti_ mosquito, which transmits the disease,
health authorities in Tegucigalpa said.

ROXAS: Capiz Governor Vicente Bermejo on Fri 6 Jul 2002 said dengue cases

of people affected. The dengue case [number] abruptly increased from 159 on
25 Jun 2002 to 203 as of Wed 3 Jul 2002. Bermejo, in a radio interview,

media to help disseminate information on how the public can avoid getting

health personnel with the assistance of the barangay officials.
City Mayor Antonio del Rosario also said the fumigation activities [had
been in progress already] in several elementary schools, the provincial
jail, and the slaughterhouse since 25 Jun 2002. The situation report
obtained by Sun Star Capiz from the office of the Governor indicates that
out of 203 victims of dengue fever: 10 are from Cuartero; 66 (the highest
number) from Dao ; 19 from Dumalag; 3 from Dumarao; 1 from Ivisan; 1 from
Jamindan; 6 from Maayon; 8 from Mambusao; 4 from Panay; 20 from Panitan; 2
