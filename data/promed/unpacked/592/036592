Plague Outbreak Claims New Victim in India
----------------------------------------------
A 30-year-old woman who had been on a respirator died of suspected
plague on Monday in India's northern state of Himachal Pradesh even as
authorities said they had contained the outbreak of the disease.
The latest victim brings the death toll to 4 while at least 14 others
have been hospitalized in the outbreak, which has revived memories of
a 1994 plague that killed more than 50 people in western India and hit
the country's reputation as a popular tourist destination.
Doctors said the woman was hospitalized for suspected plague last
week.
"No fresh case of suspected pneumonic plague has been reported from
anywhere in the past 48 hours," state Health Minister J.P. Nadda told
reporters.
He said the government had distributed some 675 000 antibiotic
capsules to 17 000 people and was keeping close tabs on the situation.
Doctors said one patient, admitted to the Post Graduate Institute of
Medical Science and Research in the city of Chandigarh, was critical
but others had responded well to the antibiotics.
A team from the New Delhi-based National Institute of Communicable
Diseases investigating the plague, which is caused by the bacterium
_Yersinia pestis_ and spread by fleas carried by rodents, said "the
disease was totally under control."
Federal Health Minister C.P. Thakur was expected to release reports on
the condition of patients in the capital, New Delhi, on Tuesday, the
team said. "Clinical tests have shown symptoms of plague but we will
wait for the NICD report before giving this disease a name," S.K.
Sharma, director of PGI, said.
"There is no need for panic as no new cases have been reported beyond
the incubation period of the disease," Dr. Pallab Ray, associate
professor at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Science and
Research, told reporters. [The incubation period is 1-7 days. -

Local transport had now resumed after it was temporarily suspended
during last week's plague scare in Rohru and Jubbal Kotkhai areas --
about 60 miles east of the provincial capital of Shimla. But schools
and colleges in the area remained closed and government doctors were
still forbidden from going on leave.
