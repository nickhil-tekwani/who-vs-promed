Meningococcal disease appears to be on the rise in WA [Western Australia] again after a 5th case was notified to authorities in a month [July 2017]. The Health Department said an elderly person was recovering in hospital after being diagnosed with serogroup Y meningococcal disease.

The incidence had been decreasing dramatically in WA over time, from a peak of 86 cases in 2000, down to 16 in 2013. But last year [2016] 23 cases were reported in WA, and there have been 15 so far in 2017.

Departmental medical coordinator Professor Paul Effler said the increase was likely due to people developing an immunity to certain strains. "I think it's in part to the mutations that happened, the changes that happened in the bacterium itself, people develop immunity to it, and we develop immunity across the population so it goes away and then it comes back if a new strain that we haven't been exposed to comes into the community," he said. "The other thing that occurred is we started doing vaccinations against meningococcal C some years ago and that's helped drive down [meningococcal serogroup] C to record low levels."

Professor Effler said outcomes were similar for all strains of the disease. He said a vaccination campaign had been launched for adolescents aged 15 to 19 after an increase in cases of the W strain. Teenagers in this group had the highest rates of carriage of the bacteria in the back of the nose and throat, and were believed most likely to be responsible for transmission to children and the elderly. "Uptake [of vaccination] is good but we'd encourage any parents, or parents of teens, or teens that are out there in those years to make sure they look for their consent form that'll be coming home from the school so they can get their vaccination for free at school," he said.

Immunity following use of a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups.

There are vaccines that contain capsular polysaccharide (A, C, Y, W135), either alone or conjugated to protein. Serogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens, because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen.

Following the mass introduction into the population of a vaccine specific for one particular serogroup, the incidence of disease due to that serogroup has been found to fall dramatically, such as, serogroup C disease in the UK following the introduction of C vaccine and serogroup A in the African meningitis belt following A vaccine, only to be replaced by emergence of disease due to other meningococcal serogroups.

A similar situation is apparently occurring in Australia following the introduction of the conjugate meningococcal C vaccine in 2003. Since 2003, there has been a significant and sustained reduction in serogroup C meningococcal cases from 34 percent of cases in 2003 to 5.7 percent in 2012, accompanied by an increase in serogroup B from 60 percent in 2003 to 83 percent in 2012 (http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-cdi3703-pdf-cnt.htm/$FILE/cdi3703e.pdf). See ProMED-mail posts: Meningitis, meningococcal - Australia (02): (SA) sg. B 20160515.4222568 and Meningitis, meningococcal - Australia: (SA) RFI 20160513.4220868.

ProMED-mail reported in 2016 that serogroup W, rather than B has become predominant in Western Australia (ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Australia (03): (WA) sg. W 20160925.4513543). The above news report concerns a case due to meningococcal serogroup Y.

Because of the replacement of serogroup C by serogroup W in the UK, the UK is now offering an expanded conjugated serogroup vaccine, Men ACWY, for adolescents, who are more likely to carry meningococcal bacteria than any other age group, to stop the spread of serogroup W. This is being done by replacing the routine teenage Men C booster with the Men ACWY vaccine (http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-acwy-vaccine.aspx).

Meningococcal serogroup B and quadrivalent conjugate (ACWY) vaccines are now funded for certain age groups in some Australian states "in response to locally predominant meningococcal B or W disease" (http://www.ncirs.edu.au/assets/provider_resources/fact-sheets/meningococcal-vaccines-fact-sheet.pdf). In Western Australia, starting in 2017, use of the quadrivalent vaccine is now funded for teenagers.

Western Australia, covering the entire western 1/3 of Australia, is mostly arid, its population being concentrated in the fertile southwest corner and its capital, Perth (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia).
