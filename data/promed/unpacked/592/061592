New cases of foot-and-mouth disease detected in Ecuador
-------------------------------------------------------
Alexandra Burbano, a technician with the Ecuadorian Animal Health
Service (SESA), confirmed today [9 Sep 2008] that 24 bovines with
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) were identified in the farm "La Tortuga"
in the Canton of Valencia, Los Rios province. She said this will be
reported to the [World Organisation for Animal Health/OIE Animal
Health Information System] in the coming hours in compliance with
international agreements.

FMD continues to be endemic with epidemic outbreaks caused by the
virus types A and O. Statistics from the epidemiological information
and surveillance system show that cyclical [epidemic?] foci have not
modified the curve of presentation of foci during the last 10 years.
This implies that the cycle of presentation of the disease has not
been broken, [thus indicating a lack of progress] towards the goal of
eradication of FMD.

On his part, Rodrigo Mena, assistant secretary of agricultural
development of the Ministry of Agriculture, lamented the situation
regarding the country's image at the international level, as Ecuador
is aiming to eradicate FMD by 2010. Should this not be achieved [the
country] will be confronted with restrictions on exportation of
agricultural products.

Mena said the situation highlights the vulnerability of the SESA
controls, as not all the livestock in the contaminated zone was
vaccinated, and furthermore, the official regulations (vaccine
applied by the vaccinator) were not followed.

Thus, a vaccination campaign against FMD will be launched in the 2nd
week of November [2008]; 4 million doses of vaccine will be required
and the government will once again subsidize the vaccine purchase. A
call for proposals will be issued over the next few days and the
government will designate USD 1 million from the State Budget [for
the vaccine purchase].

[Ruminants that have recovered from infection and vaccinated
ruminants that have contact with live FMD virus can serve as foci of
infection and carry the virus in the pharyngeal region for up to 3.5
years in cattle, 9 months in sheep, and 5 years in African buffalo.

Experimentally, it has not been possible to show transmission from a
carrier bovid to an in-contact susceptible animal, but there is
evidence that under field conditions these carrier animals initiate
new outbreaks of disease. FMD virus can be recovered from carrier
animals by culturing a sample of pharyngeal mucus and superficial
cells (collected using a probang cup) on susceptible tissue culture,
such as primary bovine thyroid cells. However, the technique is
probably only 50 percent reliable in identifying a carrier using a
single sample because the quantity of virus found in the pharynx
varies on different occasions.

This may highlight part of the control problems that this country is
experiencing.
