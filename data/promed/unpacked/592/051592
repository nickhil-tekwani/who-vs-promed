[Unfortunately, this case was only mentioned in passing in a report
of various diseases in Veracruz. No details are provided concerning
this unfortunate patient or the time and place that the infection was
acquired nor the confirmatory tests used. ProMED-mail would be very
interested in receiving these missing details, since clinical cases in
humans in southern Mexico have not been reported in ProMED-mail posts
previously. Cases have been reported from northern Mexican states,
however (see ProMED-mail archives below).
