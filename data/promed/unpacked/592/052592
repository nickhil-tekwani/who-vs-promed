Researchers at St. Louis University said Monday they had been asked to
study a smallpox vaccine because of fears the deadly virus could be spread
or revived through terrorist attacks. Smallpox was officially eradicated
through a mass vaccination program 20 years ago but could be used in
bioterrorist attacks, requiring governments to quickly find an antidote for
the deadly virus.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta has
asked the St Louis University School of Medicine Center for Vaccine
Development in Missouri, to determine the safety and effectiveness of some
of the small, remaining supply of the smallpox vaccine known as Dryvax.
"Because of the recent concerns of terrorism throughout the world, the
United States government is making efforts to improve its ability to
protect its citizens in the event of an attack," said associate professor
of infectious diseases and immunology at the university's Medicine Center
for Vaccine Development, Sharon Frey. Frey, who is leading the study, said
in a telephone interview that the main aim of their research was to measure
the effectiveness of diluted doses of Dryvax, which is no longer produced.
Of the 60 people enrolled in the study, one third will receive a vaccine
diluted 10 times, the second a vaccine diluted 100 times, and the remainder
will get the full undiluted dosage.
"Being able to dilute the vaccine would potentially increase the available
stock by 10 to 100 fold," said Frey. Frey estimated there were about seven
million Dryvax doses available in the United States -- far short of what
would be needed to inoculate the current U.S. population of 270 million in
the event of a smallpox outbreak. "There is a limited amount of supply and
the point of this is to see how much we can dilute the vaccine to see how
many available doses we could really have in the event of an attack," Frey
said. She added that the United States government, the military and others
were doing research to find other vaccines against smallpox. "Our research
will be an interim step between what we have now in terms of stocks and
finding a new vaccine," she said.
The nightmare scenario would be if the smallpox virus were released via an
aerosol at a crowded place such as a sports stadium or a political campaign
event. "We guesstimate that if one person is infected they can, in turn,
infect 25 people...You can imagine with air travel how easily we could have
a pandemic on our hands."
With smallpox, it takes about two weeks before people begin to show their
symptoms and by that time the virus would be on its way to being spread
nationwide and beyond. The World Health Organization declared the world
free of the smallpox virus in 1980 after routine vaccinations eradicated
the disease. Last year, experts from the WHO recommended further research
on the virus before the world's only known remaining stocks of smallpox in
the United States and Russia were destroyed. The stocks, kept in
high-security laboratories at the CDC in Atlanta and at the Russian State
Center for Research on Virology and Biotechnology in Novosibirsk, were to
have been destroyed last June 30. Both the United States and Russia were
among 30 states at WHO's annual assembly last May who sponsored a
resolution calling for more international research into antiviral agents
and improved vaccines.
President Clinton announced last April that he would seek a delay in
destroying the stocks because of fears the disease may be spread through
terrorist attacks.
