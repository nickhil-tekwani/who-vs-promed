Maff's "nightmare" as foot and mouth jumps 40-miles
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The foot and mouth epidemic [has spread to a previously unaffected part of
the East Coast yesterday. The latest outbreak was confirmed at a farm near
Whitby, North Yorkshire, 40 miles from the nearest case -- the virus's
biggest "jump" since the crisis began. It came the day after the virus had
made its biggest previous movement -- 30 miles to the Scottish Borders.
[See map on website. The size of the transfer shattered the Government's
claims that it was beginning to get on top of the disease and horrified
officials at the Ministry of Agriculture. As the number of cases rose to
1089 yesterday, one official told The Telegraph: "We felt we were starting
to win the battle and it is worrying that we have new cases so far away
from other outbreaks and in areas that have so far been free of the disease."
A spokesman for the National Farmers' Union said: "This is the nightmare
scenario." Ben Gill, the NFU president, said he was "concerned" about the
cases in areas remote from the centers of the outbreak. The outbreak, at
Ashes farm, Ruswarp, on the outskirts of Whitby, also dealt a serious blow
to the Government's campaign to persuade tourists that large areas of
Britain are open for business. Whitby is heavily dependent on tourism and
is only a mile from the North York Moors National Park. A national parks
official said yesterday: "This is devastating news at a time when we were
hoping that we had avoided the disease and the tourism industry was trying
to get back to something resembling normal."
The Whitby outbreak was confirmed after the farmer, Colin Holtby, became
concerned about a calf that was lame and started slavering. Maff
slaughtered the 70 cattle and 110 sheep within hours of diagnosis but the
outbreak has brought fear along the Esk valley where there are dozens of
mainly small farms. The cause of the latest outbreak is not known but the
most likely explanation is that the virus was carried on the wind. The
virus travels best in wet, windy conditions. Philip Eden, The Telegraph
weather forecaster, said it was "more than plausible" that the virus had
been carried from infected areas by south-westerly winds and rain in the
past 10 days.
The news of the Whitby outbreak was relayed to Tony Blair, who last week
ordered a wholesale reorganization of Whitehall after being shocked by the
blunders of civil servants during the foot and mouth crisis. The Prime
Minister has expressed concern at the incompetence and lack of knowledge of
some officials at the Ministry of Agriculture in particular. He has asked
Lord Simon, the former minister and the chairman of BP, to take a hard look
at how the Civil Service can be reformed in view of the lessons learnt
during the outbreak. Mr Blair believes the peer will bring his business
experience to the running of Government departments and expects him to
recommend the greater use of performance-related pay and the breakup of
large and cumbersome ministries. Since taking over the day-to-day
management of the crisis, Mr Blair has been particularly irritated by the
inability of Maff officials to provide accurate figures on the spread of
the disease.
Zoos are to be allowed to vaccinate rare breeds of animal against foot and
mouth disease by Maff after a ruling by European vets that animals can be
vaccinated without Britain losing its official "disease-free" status.
