[1] Pfizer: generic versions of COVID anti-viral pill
Date: Tue 16 Nov 2021
Source: Al Jazeera [edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/16/pfizer-strikes-deal-to-broaden-access-to-its-covid-pill


Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has signed a deal enabling the production and supply of its experimental COVID anti-viral drug in dozens of lower- and middle-income countries.

The agreement between the US company and the UN-backed international public health group Medical Patent Pool (MPP) would allow producers to manufacture and supply generic versions of the drug in 95 countries without the threat of patent infringement.

Most of the countries included in the deal are in Africa and Asia, covering about 53% of the world's population.

"Pfizer remains committed to bringing forth scientific breakthroughs to help end this pandemic for all people," Albert Bourla, Pfizer's chief executive, said on [Tue 16 Nov 2021].

"We believe oral antiviral treatments can play a vital role in reducing the severity of COVID-19 infections, decreasing the strain on our healthcare systems and saving lives," he added.

Later on [Tue 16 Nov 2021], Pfizer asked regulators in the United States to grant its pill emergency use authorization. Generic companies can start preparations for the product once they get a license, but have to wait for the regulatory approval before they can supply it.

The company has said its late-stage trials showed the pill cut the chance of hospitalization or death for adults at risk of severe disease by 89 %. The trials evaluated data from 1219 positive cases across North and South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia.

The drug has proven to be most effective if taken at an early stage of infection and in combination with an older antiviral called ritonavir.

Bourla told the Reuters news agency in early [November 2021] that the company was considering several pricing options for low-income countries, with the goal of "no barrier for them as well to have access".

Ellen 't Hoen, director of Medicines Law & Policy noted that the deal allows countries that are excluded from the list to ask generic companies to supply the product under a compulsory license. "This is an important feature of the MPP's license," she said. Compulsory licensing is when governments allow to waive patents' rights without the license owner's consent.

"With a small molecule like this - easy to make and probably already being developed by generics - a simple compulsory or voluntary license is sufficient," she said, noting that for vaccine production the process is more complex as companies need technology transfer on top of a license.

"This is an important precedent, as Pfizer has not licensed any COVID-related technology so far. The hope now is that Pfizer will do its 2nd step with the MPP by transferring technology to enable the production of its vaccine," she added.

Regina Osih, a medical doctor and infectious diseases specialist at the Aurum Institute in Johannesburg, South Africa, agreed on the positive impact of the agreement.

"These kind of deals enable everybody to potentially access COVID medicament - they are still going to exclude someone, but they will improve the conversation around equitable access," she said.

Still, medical charity Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF) said it was "disheartened" by Pfizer's announcement, noting that a number of countries including Argentina, Brazil, China, and Thailand were excluded from the agreement.

"We are disheartened to see yet another restrictive voluntary license during this pandemic while cases continue to rise in many countries around the world," said Yuanqiong Hu, a senior legal policy adviser with MSF Access Campaign.

"If Pfizer really wants to live up to its promise to contribute to equitable access to this new treatment, it should clearly state that they will not stand in the way of open generic production and competition, instead of signing restrictive voluntary licenses, and lift any kind of intellectual property monopoly during this pandemic," she said.

Pfizer's move came after US pharmaceutical company Merck signed a similar royalty-free deal with the MPP last month [October 2021] to allow its anti-viral drug, molnupiravir, to be made and sold at low cost in 105 developing countries. Merck's drug was approved by regulators in the UK earlier this month [November 2021].

The moves by Pfizer and Merck to share the patents for their COVID-19 drugs came amid international pressure on pharmaceutical companies to share and transfer technologies to allow the production of generic versions of their COVID-19 vaccines. So far, Pfizer has refused to do so.

Critics have long argued that the reluctance to share vaccine recipes has contributed to the starkly uneven distribution of shots between rich and poor countries.

Only 4.6% of people in low-income countries have received at least one shot, according to Our World in Data. Globally, 7.54 billion doses have been administered.

"Imagine what would have happened if they (vaccines makers) would have licensed their technology in May 2020," Hoen, referring to the date the World Health Organization launched the Technology Access Pool (C-TAP) platform for companies to share vaccines' intellectual property and know-how.

"Then, we would have enabled production capacity even in areas where today it does not exist," she said.

[While it is a good step that Pfizer will share a generic version of their anti-viral drug in 95 countries without the threat of patent infringement once the EUA is granted, that still leaves out a large portion of the world's population. China, Thailand, Argentina and Brazil were not included in the agreement. Furthermore, it is immoral that only 4.6% of people in low-income countries have received at least one COVID vaccine dose. Pfizer should share its technology to allow production of generic versions of their COVID-19 vaccine. No country exists in isolation and without much higher vaccination rates, the virus will continue to be transmitted, providing it opportunity to mutate. - Mod.LK]

The Czech Republic's government has resisted tightening COVID-19 rules in recent weeks, but a worsening situation in hospitals has made it consider stricter restrictions on unvaccinated people

The Czech Republic has reported a record number of new daily coronavirus infections since the pandemic started.

Health Ministry data published on [Wed 17 Nov 2021] showed there were 22 479 new infections within the preceding 24 hours. The daily figure represented a 54% jump from a week ago and surpassed a previous record of 17 778 infections seen in January [2021].

Officials tend to report the highest number of cases on Tuesdays as more people test after the weekend.

The Czech Republic's vaccination rate has lagged those of other countries, with 57.6% of the population fully vaccinated versus a European Union average of 64.9%, according to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

Hospitals reported 4425 new coronavirus cases on [Tue 16 Nov 2021], less than half of the record highs seen in [March 2021], and 661 patients in intensive care, the health ministry data showed.

The nationwide 7-day incidence - the number of new infections per 100 000 inhabitants within 7 days - rose to 813.

The surge comes as infections also rise in other European countries including neighbours Austria, Germany and Slovakia.

The Czechs have observed relatively light restrictions in the latest COVID-19 wave compared with previous ones, with the government pledging no school closures or lockdowns while promoting vaccination.

People have to show negative COVID-19 test reports or vaccination certificates to enter restaurants and bars, and they must wear masks inside.

The government had initially resisted tightening rules while in transition to a new administration expected to take office in weeks, but the worsening situation in hospitals has made officials move to impose tighterrestrictions on unvaccinated people.

On [Wed 17 Nov 2021], Caretaker Prime Minister Andrej Babis announced Czech authorities will ban people who have not been vaccinated or have not recovered from coronavirus infection from access to public events and services from [Mon 22 Nov 2021].

The restrictions, to be approved by Babis' cabinet on [Thu 18 Nov 2021], mean that negative tests will no longer be recognized as qualification to enter events and service establishments, he said on television.

The Czech Republic, home to 10.7 million people, has now recorded a total of 31 709 COVID-19 deaths, with the daily count mostly above 60 in recent days.

[Highlights from BBC 17 Nov (https://www.bbc.com/news/live/uk-59302812):
"German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said a 4th wave of COVID is "hitting us with full force", with the country facing its highest ever infection rate and "frightening" daily death tolls.

"Austria and the Czech Republic have also hit new records for daily positive tests. Czech authorities have followed Austria in placing restrictions on attendance at public events for unvaccinated people

"Cases continue to rise around Europe, with Russia recording a further 36 626 and Poland reporting a 31% rise in cases in a week

"Inflation in the UK hit its highest level for 10 years at 4.2%, with rising energy bills along with supply chain shortages during the pandemic among the causes.

"Northern Ireland ministers are due to consider a proposal to introduce vaccine passports, coming into force on 13 Dec 2021"

The US should take note!

And from the CDC:

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised against travel to the Czech Republic, Hungary and Iceland because of a rising number of COVID-19 cases in those countries.

The CDC raised its travel recommendation to "Level Four: Very High" for the 3 countries, telling Americans they should avoid travel there. (from https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-cdc-raises-covid-19-travel-warnings-czech-republic-hungary-2021-11-15/. - Mod.LK]

[3] Digital vaccine passports
Date: Wed 17 Nov 2021 6:01 AM EST
Source: NBC News [abridged, edited]
https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/demand-grows-digital-vaccine-passports-borders-reopen-rcna5269


In the week since international travelers were welcomed back to the United States, airlines, nonprofit organizations and travel groups have finally seen an uptick in the digital health passes they had hoped travelers would use since their launch.

American Airlines has been seeing a nearly 10% increase in its VeriFLY app usage for travel since the [8 Nov 2021] lifting of U.S. entry restrictions, said spokeswoman Rachel Warner. Tech research firm Apptopia noticed a 5% increase in downloads of these kinds of apps from the week before the travel ban was lifted, according to Thomas Grant, the company's director of equity research.

Travel industry experts credited this rise to the new flood of international travelers.

"With the reopening of international borders, it puts the onus on individuals to be able to prove [their vaccination status]," said Dakota Gruener, executive director at ID2020, a nonprofit group supporting digital identification. "Airports are having to staff as many people to handle much lower travel volumes than they did pre-pandemic because there's so much paperwork."

It's news that digital apps and travel experts have been counting on to help restore the industry to its pre-pandemic strength because they will process passengers more quickly.

"If we can continue to rely on handwritten, paper-based certificates or certificates that are visually scanned, it will be a less efficient process," Gruener said. "You will see backups and very long queues at takeoff and landing."

Vaccine apps have been struggling to offer a product that caters to the varied certificates and passports accepted by different countries.

Some countries in Europe, for example, require European Union citizens and residents to acquire the EU Digital COVID Certificate, or the Digital Green Certificate, to share in either digital form or paper format via a QR code. Australia is implementing an e-passport system called ICAO. India has issued more than 900 million vaccination certificates through its digital credentialing platform DIVOC (Digital Infrastructure for Vaccination Open Credentialing), according to Linux Foundation Public Health, a nonprofit organization that builds open-source software to combat epidemics. Other countries in the Asia Pacific and Africa regions such as the Philippines and Sri Lanka are also considering this option.

That means the responsibility for checking vaccination status falls to airlines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn't address on its website which digital credential is accepted as each is used and accepted differently in different countries. Airlines are required to check the vaccine records and match the name and date of birth on the traveler's passport. Vaccine provider, manufacturer and dates of vaccination are also required as proof.

Some digital credentials have compatible verifier applications for airlines to scan the pass and verify authenticity. But according to Jenny Wanger, director of programs at Linux Foundation Public Health, airlines are not necessarily equipped to have the verifier apps for all the different countries around the world.

"I would be surprised if they're actually scanning these apps," Wanger said. "What they're doing is they're looking at the digital output on somebody's phone but treating it the same as a paper card. So reading the app looks for the right name, the right dates, showing that they are fully vaccinated, as opposed to partially vaccinated."

Standardizing app credentials across borders is a major challenge. The Biden administration said in [April 2021] that the federal government will not mandate vaccine passports and has no plan to require it. So private sector companies and nonprofit groups that are developing a global certificate network hope policymakers from around the world will weigh in.

"Technology, policy and governance must go hand in hand," Gruener said. "What we're seeing right now is technology, and in some places policy, but what we don't necessarily have is this international trust framework."

Travel industry experts noted that policymakers have plenty of guidance to build on from countries that have long relied on vaccinations for entry.

"The vaccination status has been a part of travel for many years for certain countries," Wanger said. "I think it's just going to become more and more of a default, as part of what you need in place in order to travel safely."

In the meantime, travelers are eager for any guidance. The U.S. should also come up with a standardized app so travelers could upload their vaccination and testing information into the app.

["For years, people who've traveled to certain areas of the world have needed to show papers -- or a medical passport called a yellow card, created by the World Health Organization (WHO) -- to prove that they've gotten vaccines against diseases like yellow fever, cholera, and rubella.

"But there are some big concerns about vaccine passports. WHO has said that international travelers shouldn't be required to show proof that they've gotten a coronavirus vaccine. There are "critical unknowns" about how effective the vaccines are, the group says, especially with the spread of more infectious COVID variants. The Royal Society, an academy of sciences in the United Kingdom, agrees that a vaccine passport system should take into account how well different vaccines fight the COVID variants.

"WHO also says that because the supply of COVID-19 vaccines is still limited, "preferential vaccination of travelers" could lead to a shortage of shots for people who need them most: those at high risk of getting severely sick from the virus. And because a large percentage of the supply is going toward people or countries of higher socioeconomic status, the system would be tilted in their favor.

"In addition, the Royal Society says it's important that any vaccine passport system allow people to share their medical status without revealing more personal health information.

"The U.S. doesn't have digital vaccine passports yet, but President Joe Biden has issued an executive order that asks federal agencies to look into the possibility. ...

"Several countries have also created some form of COVID-19 passport, including the European Union, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Israel, China, and Bahrain. "
