Given the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Lar area of Ganderbal, an awareness camp was organized on [Tue 22 May 2018] in which livestock owners of the area participated and interacted with experts from SKUAST-K [Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology of Kashmir].
 
In the camp, farmers and farm women of Qazi Mohalla, Teli Mohalla, Repora and adjoining villages participated. The participants were made aware about the prevention, control and spread of the disease. Swabs for serotyping the causative agent of the disease were collected and necessary medicines required for the FMD affected animals were distributed among the participants. The queries raised by the farmers were patiently heard and responded by the experts
 
FMD is a highly contagious viral disease of cattle, sheep and goat which broke out in the Lar area of Ganderbal district and has caused several mortalities among animals.

FMD is endemic in India, affecting susceptible species of domestic and wild animals. India's reports to the OIE have included information on a single FMD outbreak in Jammu and Kashmir during each of the 2 years 2014 and 2015; no information from this State was available for 2016 and 2017.
 
According to the most recent available monthly global FMD report of EUFMD (FAO), March 2018, FMDV O continues to be the only serotype detected in India since May 2015; this includes the samples examined in March 2018 by ICAR-PDFMD (Indian Council of Agricultural Research - Project Directorate of Foot and Mouth Disease]. The virus was detected using antigen and/or RNA detection. Five FMDV serotype O isolates were submitted to genotyping and 4 other isolates belonging to the same serotype were subjected to vaccine matching tests. Serological testing was conducted on 1861 samples collected within epidemiological studies. All diagnostic kits used are those developed by ICAR-PDFMD.
 
Jammu and Kashmir is one of the 6 Indian States comprised in the Northern Region; the other 5 states, namely Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, are covered under India's national FMD control programme (FMDCP), which prescribes preventive vaccinations. Apparently it may be deduced that FMD vaccinations are not applied routinely in Jammu & Kashmir.
 
The above and much more information can be found in the annual report 2016-2017 of the ICAR-DFMD at http://www.pdfmd.ernet.in/index_files/Content/Reports/ICAR_DFMD_AR_2016_17_English.pdf.
 
During recent years, FMD strains from the Indian subcontinent spread into the Middle East and Northern Africa (the Maghreb), causing serious losses and threatening Europe.
