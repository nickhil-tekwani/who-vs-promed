WHO statement on novel coronavirus in Thailand
----------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) is working with officials in Thailand and China following reports of confirmation of the novel coronavirus in a person in Thailand.

The person was a traveler from Wuhan [Hubei], China, and was identified by Thai officials on [8 Jan 2020], and hospitalized that day. The person is recovering from the illness according to Thai officials.

The possibility of cases being identified in other countries was not unexpected and reinforces why WHO calls for on-going active monitoring and preparedness in other countries. WHO has issued guidance on how to detect and treat persons ill with the new virus.

The genetic sequencing shared by China enables more countries to rapidly diagnose patients.

WHO reiterates that it is essential that investigations continue in China to identify the source of this outbreak and any animal reservoirs or intermediate hosts.

Given developments, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will consult with Emergency Committee members and could call for a meeting of the committee on short notice.

The Ministry of Public Health reiterated that there is currently no outbreak of a new strain of the coronavirus. Thailand has the potential for both surveillance measures [and disease control]. Preventive disease control screening and screening of patients quickly. Early treatment and [isolation], revealed that a patient confirmed the infection of a new species of coronavirus traveling from Wuhan [Hubei], the 1st one detected outside China. At this time, the patient has no fever and is ready to return to her country

Today [13 Jan 2020] at the Ministry of Public Health, Nonthaburi Province, Mr Anutin Chanchawirakun, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Health Along with Dr Satit Patu-Techa, Deputy Minister of Public Health Dr Sukhum Kanchanaphimai, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Public Health Dr Suwanchai (MD) Wattana Yingcharoenchai Director-General of the Department of Disease Control Doctor Opas Karwarin Pong Director-General of the Department of Medical Sciences, and Dr Daniel Kurtace, Representative of the World Health Organization in Thailand have issued a Press release on surveillance measures Prevention and control of a new strain of coronavirus.

Mr Anutin said that Thailand has implemented surveillance measures for screening patients traveling from Wuhan city since [3 Jan 2020], 2020 at Samut Prakan's Suvarnabhumi International Airport, Bangkok's Don Mueang Airport, and Phuket and Chiang Mai airports, as well as surveillance at public and private hospitals. All 12 criteria have been met, with most being infected with seasonal influenza. 8 patients were treated with a high fever, detected by a thermo-scan at Suvarnabhumi Airport. Admitted to the negative pressure disease separation room Bamrasnaradura Institute on [8 Jan 2020]. The results of laboratory tests on [12 Jan 2020] found a new strain of the coronavirus, which is the 1st in Thailand and the 1st detected outside of China. [The patient is currently recovered and ready to return to the country. At this time, no new strains of the coronavirus infection have been found in Thailand. And there is ongoing surveillance of all medical personnel who provided care to [this patient]. No one has been found to be infected with this virus.

"[The Ministry of Public Health] has a policy of transparency for release of true information. The government is ready to support information and encourage public health care providers to look after this situation. Asking the public to not panic Finding patients is an effective means of our surveillance system. We are confident that we can control the situation very well," said Anutin.

Mr Anutin added that the Ministry of Public Health has the potential and readiness to act. There is an international standard for diagnosis and medical care. There is close coordination with the World Health Organization, the international agency for infectious [and non-infectious diseases]. All related agencies such as the Ministry of Transport Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ministry of Tourism and Sports National Police Agency and departments within the airport joined hands to build trust among citizens and tourists and raised surveillance measures and actions to prevent the spread of disease by screening plane passengers on the direct route from Wuhan city to all 4 international airports in Thailand. Surveillance is being conducted in both public and private hospitals, including communities in tourist areas. People can continue to travel as usual. If traveling back from the outbreak area of Wuhan within 14 days and presenting fever, sore throat, mucus, cough, sputum, or wheezing they should ask to see a doctor immediately or notify the Ministry of Public Health Department of Disease Control Hotline Tel. 1422.

[3] Thailand ex China - Media report

A Chinese tourist found to be infected with the new strain of coronavirus when she arrived in Thailand, is being treated in hospital and is expected to be discharged in a few days, Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on [Mon 13 Jan 2020].

Mr Anutin said the 61-year-old woman was recovering at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute in Nonthaburi province.

She now had no fever or any respiratory symptoms. If doctors gave her a clearance she would be allowed to go home in a few days, said Mr Anutin.

Another 16 people who were close to the woman on the same flight were examined, and the results were negative, he said.

Mr Anutin said 59 people in China have been confirmed infected with the new strain of the coronavirus, which has been linked to a sudden outbreak of pneumonia in central China. One of them died. All had attended big markets selling animals and seafood in Wuhan city. They were either workers or buyers. There had not been any human-to-human transmission of the virus.

The ill Chinese woman was the 1st person detected with the virus outside China. Her discovery and successful treatment were indicative of the efficiency and effectiveness of health services in Thailand, Mr Anutin said.

Health officials have been checking passengers from Wuhan arriving at Suvarnabhumi, Don Mueang, Phuket and Chiang Mai airports since [3 Jan 2020]. They had found 12 ill passengers who justified being quarantined. 8 had so far been treated and discharged from hospital.

The Chinese woman was being was treated in an isolation ward. Her infection with the new coronavirus was confirmed on [Sun 12 Jan 2020], Mr Anutin said.

The Public Health Ministry had not found anyone else infected with it, he said.

One of Wuhan's largest meat and seafood markets was pinpointed as the centre of the mysterious pneumonia outbreak and was shut down on [1 Jan 2020]. The man who died had been a customer at that market.

Chinese scientists identified the new virus strain last week [week of 6 Jan 2020].

Coronaviruses are not necessarily life-threatening but have been the underlying cause of public health crises, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which killed hundreds of people after an outbreak in southern China in 2002 and 2003.

The Wuhan viral outbreak seems to be less virulent and less transmittable, according to the World Health Organisation.

[News of this confirmed case in Thailand broke after yesterday's post (12 Jan 2020 Novel coronavirus - China (01): (HU) WHO, phylogenetic tree 20200112.6885385) was submitted. In the moderator comment, I cautioned that it was too early to breathe the collective sigh of relief. This report further confirms the need for caution. The virus has now been identified outside of Wuhan, China. Hopefully, this will be a single event, but again I would caution against a collective sigh of relief. Kudos to Thailand for the rapid response, public health measures and rapid testing for the Wuhan CoV.

That being said, key epidemiologic information that is missing in the reports above is whether this individual had contact with the implicated Seafood Market or individuals who had been there or at other wet markets in Wuhan in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. It will also be of interest to see the genomic sequence of the virus identified in Thailand to see if it is divergent from the virus identified in the original cluster in Wuhan.

Nonthaburi province is where the Thai Ministry of Public Health is located. A map of Thailand showing provinces can be found at https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/thailand_admin-2013.jpg
