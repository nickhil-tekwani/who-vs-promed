2003/007 New data on quarantine pests and pests of the EPPO Alert List
The EPPO Secretariat has extracted the following new data concerning
quarantine pests and pests included on the EPPO Alert List.
Detailed records
_Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens_ subsp. _flaccumfaciens_ (EPPO A2 quarantine
pest), in Canada, had so far been found only in the eastern part of the
country. It has now been found in Alberta, in the west (Hsieh et al., 2002).
_Glomerella acutata_ (EU Annexes as _Colletotrichum acutatum_) was found in
western New York, US, in 2000. This is the first report in New York state
and the second report in northeastern USA (Turechek & Heidenreich, 2002).
_Globodera pallida_ (EPPO A2 quarantine list) was detected in several
samples collected from various areas of Czech Republic (no details given)
(ProMED, 2002). This confirms earlier reports according to the EPPO
Secretariat.
_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ (EPPO A2 quarantine list)
was found in seed potato farms in Prince Edward Island, Canada. The seed
crops concerned can only be sold for consumption or processing. A major
disinfection programme is being implemented and infested land is being
removed from seed production for 2 years. (ProMED, 2002).
_Phakopsora euvitis_ (EPPO Alert List) was found in Northern Territory,
Australia, in 2001. It is considered as a very serious threat to commercial
vineyards, and severe measures have been taken in Northern Territory to
avoid its spread to the main grapevine-growing regions of Australia.
Eradication measures include inspection of grapevine plants in gardens,
destruction of infected plants and neighbouring plants.
