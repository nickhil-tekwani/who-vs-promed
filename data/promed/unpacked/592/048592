The number of people who have reported feeling ill after eating at
Berkshire's Michelin-starred restaurant "The Fat Duck" has risen to
400. Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal closed his restaurant in Bray
more than a week ago after 40 customers fell ill. Mr Blumenthal said
tests had ruled out food poisoning. In a statement the Health
Protection Agency (HPA) said cases reported to the restaurant had
risen since media coverage of the outbreak.

A boxing promoter said he fell ill after eating at the restaurant
with friends and would welcome an apology. "I really [did] enjoy the
experience of it all," he said. The people I was with, all of them
are still suffering. Heston's obviously a very talented guy, I watch
his [TV] programs and I hope he gets it sorted out."

The HPA's Thames Valley Health Protection Unit is working with the
Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead's environmental health
department to investigate the outbreak of vomiting and diarrhea. The
restaurant remained shut on Fri 6 Mar 2009.

Dr Graham Bickler, regional director of the HPA south east region,
said: "This is a very complex outbreak. We are working closely... to
explain what happened and to ensure that the risks of it happening
again are reduced as much as possible."

Samples have been taken from foodstuffs, people who have reported
feeling ill, and staff and work surfaces in the search for the cause
of the illness. The chef said the entire menu had been tested and all
results had proved negative. Final tests are being carried out to see
if an airborne virus caused the sickness.

One diner went to the Fat Duck to celebrate his birthday in January
2009. His brother and mother became ill and believes the cause could
be a winter vomiting bug [norovirus]. "While we all had a fantastic
time, my brother and mother fell ill with diarrhea and vomiting, for 5
days after," he added.

Diners at "The Fat Duck", 1 of only 3 restaurants in the UK with 3
Michelin stars, can experience dishes such as snail porridge or
scrambled-egg-and-bacon ice cream. Opened in 1995, "The Fat Duck" was
voted "the best place to eat on Earth" by "Restaurant" magazine in
2005. [Taster menu begins at UKL 125 = US$176 - Mod.JW]

[The epidemiology of this large cluster of illness, associated with a
celebrity chef's highly rated UK restaurant, must be known in order to
be able to focus in on the cause. The incubation period from dining to
onset of symptoms, length of illness, and the presence or absence of
fever are 3 observations that can help distinguish a specific cause
here. Norovirus is a strong possibility -- see ProMED refs for 2000 &
2005 below.

Berkshire is a county in southern England. It is also often referred
to as the Royal County of Berkshire because of the presence of the
royal residence of Windsor Castle in the county. It can be found on a map at:
