CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS & REPEATED GI OUTBREAKS (5)
===================================================
A report by Birkhead et al., and two other studies cited in that report,
document the finding of >1,000,000 CFU/gm of C. perfringens in
institutionalized well patients (Birkhead G, Bogt RL, Heun E, et al.
Characterization of an outbreak of Clostridium perfringens food poisoning by
quantitative fecal culture and fecal enterotoxin measurement. J CLIN
MICROBIOL 1988;26(3):471-4).
Given that you imply that:
- diagnostic criteria were not consistent with C. perfringens illness;
- enterotoxin assay was apparently not performed; and
- C. perfringens was recovered from only one patient and that recovery was
deemed incidental,
there seems little point in doing any special investigations now after the
problem has resolved. If the problem occurs again, then there may be value
in toxin assays and typing of organisms. Otherwise, the difficulty of
accurately identifying GI infection cases in such settings; the distinct
possibility of other dietary, metabolic, or infectious etiologies; and the
occurrence of C. perfringens as normal fecal flora (which may explain the
sporadic other cases you found historically) weigh against advising anything
beyond watchful waiting now. A review by Bennett may be of interest (Bennet
RG, Diarrhea among residents of long-term care facilities. INFECT CONTROL
HOSP EPIDEMIOL 1993;14(7):397-404); the relatively small number of C.
perfringens citations in the PARADIGM database might suggest that it does
not figure prominently among nosocomial infections.
