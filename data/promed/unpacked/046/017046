Another case of foot and mouth disease [FMD] has been detected in
Uiseong County, North Gyeongsang Province, following the 1st outbreak
[identified] in Andong on 29 Nov 2010.

The disease has thus been found in 7 areas nationwide: Andong,
Yecheon, Yeongyang, Bonghwa, Yeongju, Yeongdeok and Uiseong.

The Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said Monday [13
Dec 2010] that the National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service
found that cows at a Uiseong farm tested positive for the disease.

During an observation period on Sunday [12 Dec 2010], authorities
found suspected symptoms of FMD at the farm, and the cows at the farm
were culled to prevent the spread of the disease.

"The farm owner visited by car an agricultural machine repair shop 900
meters away from a farm in Andong on 9 Dec 2010, when the disease was
rampant," the ministry said. "We suspect that the virus was spread via
this car."

The case is not a "direct infection" from the virus that 1st spread in
Andong and its vicinity in the initial stage of the outbreak but a
"secondary infection," in which the virus in Andong went through the
control area.

Proper control and prevention were not made, however, though the farm
owner visited the danger zone (within a 3-km radius).

The ministry said: "Cows within a 500-meter radius from the infected
farm were culled, and we are taking stronger measures to prevent the
spread of the virus from Uiseong to other regions."

A combined [total of] 147 173 cows have been culled due to this outbreak.
