Situation at a glance
---------------------
Public health authorities in Spain reported the detection of influenza A(H5N1) in 2 poultry workers on a single farm, following an outbreak in poultry confirmed on 20 Sep 2022. Given the potential impact on public health, a multisector response including measures for control, prevention, and early detection was initiated in the poultry farm. The detection of influenza A(H5N1) in these individuals was likely due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. No evidence of human-to-human transmission of influenza A(H5N1) virus in this event has been identified to date.

Description of the case
-----------------------
On 27 Sep 2022, the Ministry of Public Health of Spain notified WHO of a case of influenza A(H5N1) in an individual working at a poultry farm in the province of Guadalajara. An outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) in poultry had been confirmed on the farm on 20 Sep 2022. Nasopharyngeal samples were subsequently collected from all 12 farm workers on 23 Sep 2022 and influenza A(H5N1) virus was detected in a sample from one of the workers (a 19-year-old male) on 27 Sep 2022. He remained in isolation until 28 Sep 2022 when a 2nd sample tested negative by RT-PCR. On 28 Sep 2022, samples from one close contact of the case were collected, which tested negative for avian influenza by RT-PCR.

Following response measures on the farm, all workers were tested again on 13 Oct 2022. Influenza A(H5N1) virus was detected in a nasopharyngeal sample from another worker (a 27-year-old male involved in the control measures including cleaning and disinfection whilst wearing personal protection equipment) on 13 Oct 2022. He had initially tested negative during the 1st round of testing on 23 Sep 2022. He remained in isolation until 22 Oct 2022 when a 2nd sample tested negative by RT-PCR. Two close contacts of his were identified and tested negative on respiratory sampling.

Both cases did not have any symptoms. Samples were tested using RT-PCR at the National Microbiology Center.

Epidemiology of disease
-----------------------
Zoonotic influenza infections in humans may range from asymptomatic or mild upper respiratory infection (fever and cough) to rapid progression to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, and even death.

Human cases of infection with avian influenza viruses are usually the result of direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead poultry or contaminated environments.

From 2003 to 21 Oct 2022, a total of 868 human cases of infection with influenza A(H5N1), including these 2 cases, and 456 deaths have been reported globally from 21 countries. A total of 3 human cases of infection with influenza A (H5N1), one case from the United Kingdom in 2021 and 2 cases from Spain in 2022 have been reported in Europe to date.

Public health response
----------------------
- Coordination and response: A multisector response including measures for control, prevention, and early detection has been carried out in poultry farms according to the Practical Operations Manual of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
- Surveillance: A follow-up response including passive and active surveillance of exposed workers and close contacts has been initiated. Excluding the reported cases, all other individuals who were exposed at the affected poultry farm were monitored for 7 days following the last day of exposure to infection and have not developed any symptoms.
- Laboratory: Virus characterization, and serological studies are in process. The samples from both cases were sent on 24 Oct 2022 to the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Crick Worldwide Influenza Centre in London, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
- Infection prevention and control: In the affected farms, measures related to the control of the outbreak have been undertaken, including on-site slaughter of the birds, the destruction of contaminated materials that could carry the virus, and the cleaning and disinfection of the facilities. All participants involved in the culling process wore personal protective equipment.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
Individuals are at risk of becoming infected with avian influenza viruses if they are exposed to infected birds or virus-contaminated fomites or environments.

Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. The detection of influenza A(H5) virus in nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples collected from individuals in close contact with infected poultry or other birds, whether the individuals are symptomatic or not, is not unexpected. Good quality serological investigations may be useful in differentiating infection from contamination in these cases and allow for a better assessment of the risk of human infection. There was no evidence of human-to-human transmission in this event.

In the current outbreak of HPAI A(H5N1) on a poultry farm in Spain, both human and animal health agencies have implemented public health measures. Based on the available information, WHO assesses that the risk for the general population posed by this virus is low, and for occupationally exposed persons, it is low to moderate.

WHO advice
----------
The reports of these 2 influenza A (H5N1) cases do not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza.

WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions with regard to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.

Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.

When avian influenza viruses are circulating in an area, people involved in high-risk tasks such as sampling sick birds, culling, and disposing of infected birds, eggs, litters and cleaning of contaminated premises should be trained in the proper use of and provided with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). All persons involved in these tasks should be registered and monitored closely by local health authorities for 7 days following the last day of contact with poultry or their environments.

In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiologic investigation (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiological investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus and clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Centre for further characterization.

Currently, there is no vaccine to protect against avian influenza in humans. WHO recommends that all people involved in work with poultry or birds should have a seasonal influenza vaccination to reduce the theoretical risk of a reassortment event.

Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces. General precautions include regular hand washing and good food safety and food hygiene practices. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community-level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.

All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR) and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.

Two Spanish poultry farm workers tested positive for bird flu following an outbreak in poultry, in what appears to be the 1st known human infections in Spain and the 2nd in Europe since 2003, the World Health Organization said on Thursday [3 Nov 2022].

The poultry outbreak was confirmed by authorities on 20 Sep 2022 and there has been no evidence to date of human-to-human transmission related to this event, the WHO said.

The infections with influenza A (H5N1) of the 2 workers -- males aged 19 and 27 -- were detected in September and October [2022], likely triggered by exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments at the farm in Guadalajara* in central Spain.

Both men did not have any symptoms and were isolated until they tested negative. Following the poultry outbreak, all farm workers and their close contacts were tested.

Spain's Health Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Bird flu infections in humans may range from asymptomatic or mild upper respiratory infection to rapid progression to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, and even death.

From 2003 to 21 Oct 2022, a total of 868 human cases, including the 2 cases in Spain, and 456 deaths have been reported globally from 21 countries, according to the WHO.

A total of 3 human cases of infection, one case from the United Kingdom in 2021 and 2 cases from Spain in 2022, have been reported in Europe to date, it said.

The reports of these 2 cases do not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza, the organization said.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has just confirmed the existence of a 2nd case of bird flu in humans registered in Spain. This is the 2nd affected after the one notified in October [2022] on a farm in the province of Guadalajara. This new case would be another worker from the same poultry farm, according to information that the Spanish public health authorities have sent to the WHO.

The international organization points out that "given the potential impact on public health, a multisectoral response that includes measures for control, prevention and early detection of influenza A(H5N1) was initiated at the poultry farm [after detecting the 1st case]. In these individuals, infection was likely due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments No evidence of person-to-person transmission has been identified to date the influenza A(H5N1) virus has been identified in this event."

After the response measures in the poultry farm, all the workers were examined on 13 Oct 2022 and the influenza A (H5N1) virus "was detected in a nasopharyngeal sample from another worker (a 27-year-old man who participated in the control measures, including cleaning and disinfection with personal protective equipment)", details the WHO. The man initially tested negative during the 1st round of testing on 23 Sep 2022.

The infected worker remained in isolation until 22 Oct 2022 when a 2nd sample came back negative by RT-PCR. Two close contacts of his were also identified and tested negative in respiratory sampling.

Both cases did not present any symptoms. The samples were analyzed by RT-PCR at the National Center for Microbiology.

It should be remembered that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and the reference laboratory of the European Union (EU) warned at the beginning of October [2022], that the 2021-2022 bird flu season is the largest observed in Europe so far.

At the time [October 2022], there had already been 2467 outbreaks in poultry, 48 million birds slaughtered in affected establishments, 187 detections in captive birds, and 3573 events of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds.

[On 27 Sep 2022, the detection of influenza A(H5N1) was confirmed in respiratory sample from a 19 year old male poultry farm worker, in the province of Guadalajara, where an outbreak of Inf A(H5N1) had been reported in birds on 17 Sep 2022. This constituted the 1st detection in humans in Spain.

The above reports highlight identification of a 2nd case among poultry farm workers from the same outbreak during a 2nd testing on 13 Oct 2022. It is important to note that this individual had initially tested negative during the 1st round of testing on 27 Sep 2022.

Both these cases did not report any symptoms and their close contacts have tested negative as well.

Including these 2 cases, from 2003 to 4 Nov 2022, a total of 868 human cases of infection with influenza A(H5N1), and 456 deaths have been reported globally from 21 countries.

To date, a total of 3 human infections with influenza A (H5N1) have been reported in Europe, one case from the United Kingdom in 2021 and 3 cases from Spain in 2022.

These recent reports of 2 influenza A (H5N1) cases do not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza. WHO has not advised any special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions with regard to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.

Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.

Under the International Health Regulations (IHR), State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify the WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. - Mod.UBA
