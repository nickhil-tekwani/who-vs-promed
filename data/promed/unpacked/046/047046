[The following information on Myanmar can be found in the June - 2017 European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) monthly report "Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation."

"FMDVs ASIA 1 and O were detected in 4 of the 5 bovine samples collected between January and May 2017. The VP1 of the detected viruses was genotyped as Asia 1/ASIA/G-VIII and as O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d. Of note is that the last detection of Asia 1 serotype in Pool 1 was in 2009 in China (People's Rep. of). For Asia 1/ASIA/G-VIII, the most closely related sequence of a field virus not pertaining to the country is represented by that detected in cattle of Bangladesh (BAN GA Sr-187 2013) during 2013, with a seq id of 97.6 percent. For the viruses belonging to the O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d lineage, the most closely related sequence of a field isolates not pertaining to the country are those represented by the one detected in cattle of the Russian Federation (Zabaikalskiy/3/RUS/2016), with a seq id major then 99.4 percent and in cattle of Nepal (MYA/19/2017), with a seq id of 98.7 percent."
