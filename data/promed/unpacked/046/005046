11 villagers in Guangdong's Xuwen County are suspected to have [food]
poisoning after eating jumping fish (mudskippers), and 1 has
died. Ciguatera is preliminarily suspected.
A famiily of 4 in Dajing Village was 1st to become ill with [food]
poisoning. After eating jumping fish on Wed, 7 Mar 2007, they felt
dizzy and their extremities and mouth were numb. These symptoms were
associated with nausea. Later it was discovered that the house cat
had died after eating fish, so they called the Police and were sent
to hospital for treatment.
The next day a neighboring family of 3, also suspected to have eaten
jumping fish, developed [food] poisoning. Among them, the 56 year
old male head of the house died. Samples have already been sent to
Zhenjiang for analysis. Local sales of jumping fish have been suspended.

On 7 Mar 2007, a food poisoning incident occurred in Xilian Township
in Xuwen County, causing 11 to be sickened. Of these 1 male died at
home from suspected [food] poisoning. The county has discovered no
new cases of food poisoning. Hospitalized patients are in stable
condition and are not in critical danger.
The food poisoning incident occurred on 7 Mar 2007 in Dajing Village
Committee of Xilian Township. Initially, 4 members of a family were
hospitalized with [food] poisoning. Soon thereafter 6 others were
hospitalized. At the same time, a 54 year old male villager died at
home from suspected [food] poisoning.
The county's Hygiene and Epidemic Prevention Station confirmed
through investigation that all of the patients consumed varying
levels of mudskipper (known locally as "jumping fish"), goby,
snailfish and other shallow marine fish they caught in Liusha Bay
near Dajing Village Committee of Xilian Township.

[Coral reef fish tend to be associated with this illness and not the
"shallow marine fish" noted in the posting. The dizziness, numbness
and nausea, however, are consistent with the entity. Followup
information on this cluster would be interesting.
The following information is adapted from several previous postings
on ciguatera in ProMED:
Ciguatera is caused by consumption of fish that feed on certain
dinoflagellates (i.e., algae) often associated with coral reef
systems. At least 5 types of ciguatoxin have been identified and are
noted to accumulate in larger and older fish higher up the food
chain. Ciguatera poisoning generally is believed to be confined to
coral reef fish in water between the latitudes of 35 degrees N and 35
degrees S.
Species of fish most frequently implicated include groupers,
amberjack, red snappers, eel, sea bass, barracuda, and Spanish
mackerel. Fish larger than 2 kg contain significant amounts of toxin
and readily produce toxic effects when ingested. Although not
completely reliable, an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and mouse biologic
assay are available for detection of ciguatoxin in affected fish.
Ciguatoxin and other similar toxins are heat-stable and
lipid-soluble; they are unaffected by temperature, gastric acid, or
cooking method. Presence of toxin does not affect odor, color, or
taste of the fish.
Ciguatoxin produces toxic effects by activation of voltage-dependent
sodium channels, resulting in hyperexcitability, decreased
conduction, and prolonged refractoriness.
A discussion and picture of a mudskipper can be found at:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudskippers>. It is not a reef
fish. Of note, mudskippers have the ability to breathe through their
skin and the lining of their mouth (the mucosa) and throat (the
pharynx). This is only possible when the mudskipper is wet, limiting
mudskippers to humid habitats and requiring that they keep themselves
moist. This mode of breathing, similar to that employed by
amphibians, is known as cutaneous air breathing.
