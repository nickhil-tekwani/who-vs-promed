The Municipality yesterday [29 Apr 2008] banned the sale of unpacked
fluid milk in the country. The move came following an outbreak of cow
tuberculosis. Cooperatives have already begun pulling local milk and beef
products from shelves over fears of infection.

The ban was decided during a meeting of the Food Safety Committee
under the Municipality, which focused on cow TB, Mohamed Al-Etebi,
chairman of the committee said. The committee asked the Public
Authority for Agriculture Affairs and Fish Resources (PAAAFR) to
compile a detailed report on necessary measures for preventing cow
tuberculosis and a potential ban on infected cow farms, he said.

The PAAAFR was also awarded the task of killing infected cattle in a
bid to curb the disease, Al-Etebi added. The Municipality has already
begun to test random samples of local dairy products now available at
the market and to allocate an area for killing infected cattle in
line with relevant technical and health criteria, the official noted.

[According to OIE's WAHID interface, bovine tuberculosis, a
reportable disease, is endemic in Kuwait. During the period
July-December 2007, 2 outbreaks were reported in Al Jahrah; see at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=disease_status_detail_pop&pop=1&diseaseid=32&country=KWT&y=2007&m=7&admin1=1626&detail=3&sdid=123198>.

Reportedly, out of 1261 susceptible bovines, there were 522 cases, of
which 5 were slaughtered. The large number of "cases" (of which only 5
were slaughtered) is in need of clarification. (Could the number 5 be
a typo for 522? - Mod.JW).

According to WAHID's table "Zoonoses in humans" at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=country_zoonoses>
during 2005, 3 cases of bovine tuberculosis were reported in Kuwaiti
humans (0.1284 per 100 000 population). No such cases have been
reported for 2006; information for 2007 is not (yet?) available.

Prevention of bovine tuberculosis in humans is generally achieved by
2 main measures: pasteurization of milk and dairy products and
eradication of the disease in the bovine population, particularly
dairy cattle, applying the "test and slaughter" policy. Information
on Kuwait's policy and the number of tuberculine tests (commentary in
20070318.0956) performed within the framework of its declared
"targeted surveillance" in the local bovine population, will be
helpful.

According to the WAHID interface, the bovine population of Kuwait
(2007) is 20 000; see, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=country_population&year=2007&selected_species=3>.
