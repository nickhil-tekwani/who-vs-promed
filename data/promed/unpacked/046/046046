A 42-year-old woman from Sheridan is the state's 11th resident to be
diagnosed with a hantavirus, the cause of 3 deaths in Montana since 1993.
The woman was treated in hospitals at Dillon and Butte last Thursday and
Friday before being transferred to a Billings hospital, according to state
health officials. The disease symptoms began 15 Sep 1999.
Health officials have started an investigation into how the woman got the
disease [infection, said Ken Pekoc, spokesman for the state Department of
Public Health and Human Services.

(5) The fifth case involved a 58-year-old Sanders County woman in Feb 1997.
(6) A Powell County woman was the sixth person to contract the disease, in
Aug 1997.
(7) A 36-year-old Malta-area farmer died of the disease in July 1998.

a Dillon doctor was credited with saving his life.
