A 4-year-old child has become Viet Nam's 1st victim of the H5N1 bird flu [avian influenza] virus in more than a year, a health worker said, amid growing regional concerns about the virulent disease.

The death comes as neighbouring China scrambles to contain a new H7N9 strain that had not previously been transmitted from birds to humans but has now killed 7 [now 9] people since February 2013.

"A test result confirmed the 4-year-old boy was infected with H5N1," a staff member at the healthcare centre in Viet Nam's southern province of Dong Thap, which handled the case, told AFP.

It was not immediately clear exactly when the child died and health officials in Hanoi were unavailable for comment.

It was Viet Nam's 1st fatality from the H5N1 virus since late January 2012.
