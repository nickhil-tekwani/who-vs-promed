Despite successive warnings in recent years, Brazil has not yet managed to stop the advance of syphilis. Last year [2018], the country recorded the largest number of cases of the disease since 2010, when reporting began to occur regularly, according to data from the Ministry of Health.

In 2018 alone, there were 158 000 cases of acquired syphilis, equivalent to 75.8 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. For comparison, a year earlier, this rate was 59.1 cases per 100 000.

Experts reason better detection, but there is also lack of penicillin and a refusal to prevent. Preliminary data from 2019 indicate that the trend is unlikely to reverse this year [2019].

This advance trend is global and worries the World Health Organization, although the organization does not have updated numbers of disease prevalence.

Experts say data represent an improvement in identifying cases through examinations and difficulty in controlling the progress of the disease in the country.

"At least 3 times a week I get test results that show syphilis. Many are from patients who have had treatment but became infected again. Every day this becomes more frequent," said infectious disease specialist Eliana Bicudo, consultant to the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases.

According to the Ministry of Health, other factors have contributed to the increase in cases. "There is progress in the disease [increasing incidence], related both to greater detection capacity and the reduction of preventive measures," said the Secretary of Health Surveillance, Wanderson Oliveira. Chief among them, he says, is a reduction in condom use, in a context where people have more [multiple] sexual partners.

Still, according to the secretary, problems in the supply of penicillin in recent years also helped to boost the disease in different countries.

[The news report above fails to say much about the epidemiology of syphilis in Brazil, other than that there is an increasing incidence (presumably primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis, the most infectious stages of the disease), although the specific stage of syphilis being reported is not mentioned in the article; in 2018 the reported incidence was 75.8 cases per 100 000 population, the highest since 2010, when reporting began to occur regularly, according to data from the Ministry of Health. The health authorities are attributing this rising incidence to greater detection and decreased condom use, especially among people with multiple sexual partners.

In the US, after syphilis reached historic lows in 2000, with less than 6000 reported cases and an incidence of only 2.1 cases per 100 000 people, the country has since experienced a rising incidence of P&S syphilis. In 2018, 35 063 cases of P&S syphilis were reported, yielding a rate of 10.8 cases per 100 000 population (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats18/STDSurveillance2018-full-report.pdf).

During 2000-2015, the rise in the rate of reported P&S syphilis in the US was primarily attributable to increased cases among men, specifically among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). Similar to past years, in 2018, MSM accounted for the majority (53.5%) of all reported cases of P&S syphilis and, of these, 41.6% were known to be living with diagnosed HIV.

Although rates of P&S syphilis are lower among women, rates have increased substantially in recent years, increasing 30.4% during 2017-2018 and 172.7% during 2014-2018, suggesting a rapidly growing heterosexual epidemic (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats18/STDSurveillance2018-full-report.pdf).

The increasing incidence in women has been associated with increasing rates of congenital syphilis. Since 2013, the rate of congenital syphilis has increased each year. In 2018, 1306 cases of congenital syphilis were reported (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats18/STDSurveillance2018-full-report.pdf).

Similar trends have been seen in other countries (such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Japan), where increases have recently also occurred in the incidence of syphilis among women, accompanied in some countries by increases in congenital syphilis. ECDC reported a similar trend in some western EU/EEA countries, but not in eastern EU countries (https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/syphilis-notifications-eueea-70-2010).

The reasons for the increases in the incidence of syphilis are varied and likely differ by locality and the patient population affected. Increased diagnostic testing for syphilis could contribute to some extent to the increased incidence in some groups, such as MSM. Some of the factors that could promote unprotected (condomless) sex include lack of sex education and access to condoms for teenagers and young adults; the opioid epidemic and sale of sex for drugs; the popularity of cell phone geolocating dating apps that facilitate sexual activity with multiple anonymous partners; use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners; use of psychoactive "party drugs"; and use among MSM of pre-exposure HIV prophylaxis, or PrEP, which is a way to prevent HIV infection for people who do not have HIV but who are at substantial risk of getting it by engaging in risky condomless sexual activity (https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/PrEP_fact_sheet_final.pdf).

A CDC study showed that during 2013-2017, when the P&S syphilis rate increased 72.7% nationally in the US and 155.6% among women, the use of methamphetamine, injection drugs, and heroin more than doubled among women and heterosexual men with P&S syphilis. Similar trends have been seen in Canada (ProMED-mail post Syphilis - Canada: (MB) increased incidence, methamphetamine use, 2018 20190131.6287056). The data in the US did not reveal the same increases in drug use among gay men with syphilis, the group with the highest rates of the disease.

The linkage of illicit drug use and syphilis transmission is reminiscent of the increase in syphilis among heterosexuals during the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, when the practice of trading sex with multiple partners for drugs, especially crack cocaine, played a major role in the transmission of syphilis. Under these circumstances, the identities of sex partners are often unknown, which weakens the traditional syphilis-control strategy of partner notification.

More information on the epidemiology of syphilis in Brazil would be welcome from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
