A town in Northern Samar in Eastern Visayas was the latest to feel the
scourge of dengue, experiencing a surge in dengue cases this month [Jul
2007] alone.
Radio dzBB reported Monday [30 Jul 2007] that Pambujan town in Northern
Samar noted a rapid rise in dengue cases, from one case as of 3 Jul to 24
cases as of 25 Jul [2007].
It said that at least 2 girls aged 5 and 7 had succumbed to the disease,
adding that the town had recorded at least 255 cases since the start of
this year [2007].

A construction site at Clementi Road has become the 2nd most active dengue
cluster in Singapore. Authorities found 33 new cases there last week [23-27
Jul 2007], and 20 of them were reported within just 3 days. The Varsity
Park construction site opposite the National University of Singapore is
believed to be the area of the cause.
Woh Hup, the company overseeing the building work, said it is in discussion
with the National Environment Agency. Both are working on preventive
measures to mitigate the problem but did not elaborate what those measures are.
Elsewhere in Singapore, the total number of new dengue cases has dipped. As
of 28 Jul [2007], 322 cases were reported that week. That is lower than the
363 cases recorded in the week before.

Dengue claimed its 1st victim in Pimpri-Chinchwad on Friday [3 Aug 2007]
after a 50 year old man succumbed to dengue at Niramaya Hospital in Chinchwad.
PCMC medical officer Dr Kamal Yadav said this was a confirmed case of
dengue. Niramaya Hospital doctors said the man was admitted 5 days ago and

Dengue fever has killed 35 people in Viet Nam so far this year [2007], and
nearly 33 000 others have been infected with the mosquitoborne disease,
officials and state media said on Monday [30 Jul 2007].
The number of cases was 41 per cent higher in the period from January to
June [2007] than in the same period last year [2006], said the General
Statistics Office (GSO).
The GSO did not give a death toll, but the deputy head of the country's
preventive health care department, Nguyen Van Binh, told the communist
party mouthpiece Nhan Dan, of People Daily, that 35 people had died. The
illness has spread rapidly in Viet Nam's central and southern Mekong Delta
provinces, Binh said.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed concerns that Asia could
see a dengue epidemic this year [2007] on a par with that of 1998, when
nearly 1500 people died. More than 1000 people have been killed by dengue
fever in Indonesia alone this year [2007].

[The above newswire reports an increase of 4000 cases of dengue since the
last PRO/MBDS posting on 12 Jul 2007, when 29 000 cases were reported (see
Dengue - Viet Nam (10): DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 20070712.2226). In the 29 Jul
2007 posting, there were reports of 25 deaths, or 10 fewer than the current
report.

The United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) has warned against the
worst outbreak of dengue in Asia in nearly a decade. Reports are surfacing
of thousands of people affected by the illness in Singapore, Viet Nam,
Cambodia and other South ast Asian countries.
The worst-hit country by this mosquito-borne virus is Cambodia, where the
disease has attacked about 25 000 people and killed nearly 300 children
this year [2007]. According to WHO, the figures in Cambodia are worrisome,
as they are about 3 times more than the number of cases for all of 2005.
Experts from WHO fear that the current outbreak could reach the dangerous
levels of the last major outbreak to hit Southeast Asia in 1998, when about
350 000 cases were reported in the region, including nearly 1500 deaths.

[In the last PRO/MBDS posting on dengue in Cambodia posted on 10 Jul 2007
(see Dengue - Cambodia (03): RFI 20070710.2197), there were reports of a
total of 14 986 cases with 182 deaths attributable to dengue. In the above
newswire, the total number of cases has almost doubled to a total of
approximately 25 000 cases with almost 300 deaths, both significant
increases in 3 weeks time. As this is "early" in the dengue season, reasons
for concern are real. PRO/MBDS would appreciate more information on the
current dengue situation in Cambodia from knowledgeable sources, including
serotypes of the virus involved in this year's (2007) activity.

Sao Paulo registers 526 more cases of dengue
------------------------------------------------
Dengue, as a disease that was always associated with summer, can also have
victims in winter. According to the total in the Sao Paulo Prefecture, in
the last 35 days, there has been an increase of 526 in confirmed dengue
cases in the Sao Paulo [state] capital. Up to 20 Jun [2007], there were
1578 persons infected [with dengue virus] by _Aedes aegypti_. A little more
than a month later, on 25 Jun [2007], the number jumped to 2104 registered
cases. Of the total [dengue3] cases in Sao Paulo, 35 were contracted in the
month of June [2007] an increase of 483 percent compared to the same month
last year [2006], when there were 6. To prevent more occurrences [of dengue
transmission] the prefecture has contracted 1000 agents to combat dengue in
winter.
The state (Sao Paulo) capital faces a record increase in dengue [cases].
The 2104 registered [cases] as of 25 Jul [2007] are almost 3 times more
than the historical number, in 2003, when there were 760 cases. In the
entire state [of Sao Paulo] there has been an explosion in the number of
[dengue] infected [patients]: 57 261, with 15 deaths, in 6 months, compared
to 50 027 and 6 deaths in 2006.
