Special ProMED-mail 20th Anniversary Award for Excellence in Outbreak Reporting on the Internet presented to Barbara Hatch Rosenberg, Stephen Morse, and Jack Woodall
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Each year, ProMED-mail presents an award in honor of the anniversary of its founding in August 1994. This year [2014] we are pleased to present the award to ProMED's founders.

In 1994, these individuals had the foresight to recognize the growing importance of emerging biological threats. At the same time, they understood the potential of the Internet in detecting and communicating these threats. Finally, they realized the usefulness of "informal" sources of information, both inside and outside traditional health systems and the need for transparency in outbreak reporting. They collaborated to found ProMED-mail, the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases, and launch it as a network of only 40 members. This seed grew to encompass many thousands of individuals all over the world and to become a widely used and highly respected source of global public health epidemic intelligence.

We are pleased to announce this award to Barbara, Steve, and Jack during the 20th anniversary year of ProMED's birth.
