The South Sudanese health ministry has confirmed that 8 people died from infections of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in the country's Bentiu camp for internally displaced persons (IDPs). John Rumunu, head of health services in the Ministry of Health, said on Sunday [15 Aug 2021] evening that 219 new cases have been reported in 2021, bringing the total to 905 in the oil-rich state since 2019, when the outbreak was first reported in Bentiu IDP camp.

Hepatitis E virus infection can lead to acute liver failure and death, and is particularly dangerous among pregnant women. Symptoms of HEV infection include jaundice, fever, loss of appetite, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The virus can be transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology, including genotypes that are zoonotic. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, whereas zoonotic genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Acute epidemic hepatitis E is attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. Many of the deaths are in pregnant women, characteristic of genotype 1.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation, such as occurs with displaced populations, increase the risk for transmission of the virus. - Mod.LL
