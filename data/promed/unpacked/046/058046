CFIA cannot rule out testing for mop-top in Canada: 3 states dropped from
list of confirmed cases
-------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has not ruled out the
possibility of widespread testing of Canadian fields for potato mop-top
virus, following recent developments.

Alain Boucher, seed potato specialist for the CFIA, in Moncton, N.B., was
cited as confirming his agency will consider testing Canadian fields since
it is conceivable, based on vast movements of potatoes north and south of
the border, that Canadian provinces may have received some infected seed
potatoes.

There are no confirmed cases in Canada, but at least 2 seed lots were sent
north from the U.S., and the CFIA is beginning tracebacks on those
shipments. It is also possible that some of the progeny from those potatoes
could have been shipped back across the U.S. border.

Though new cases haven't been confirmed in Canada, it's possible infected
seed potatoes could have been sent to one or more Canadian provinces, said
Boucher.

Based on new documentation received last week, the CFIA and U.S. regulators
removed 3 states, Delaware, California, and New Jersey, from the list of 11
where potato mop top was previously "confirmed".

U.S. and Canadian officials met in Washington, D.C., Monday and Tuesday to
discuss the matter.

[PMTV is a species in the genus Pomovirus that causes an economically
important disease of potato. _Spongospora subterranea_ infects roots,
stolons, and/or young tubers, causing powdery scab disease. Motile
zoospores of the fungus acquire PMTV from infected potato plants, which
then infect healthy potatoes. PMTV has been recorded in Asia, Europe, and
in North and South America. The fact that PMTV-infected seed potatoes may
have been transported to Canada presents a possible danger to the seed
potato industry in Canada.
