A 15-year-old boy [whom local tests showed to be affected by] bird
flu, has died at Hasan Sadikin Hospital in the Indonesian town of
Bandung, local media reported on 2 Feb 2006. If the tests are
confirmed by the World Health Organisation's accredited lab in Hong
Kong, the case would be Indonesia's 15th human fatality from bird
flu, said The Jakarta Post newspaper.
The teenager, a resident of Padalarang in Bandung regency, some 150
km south of Jakarta, was admitted to the hospital on 30 Jan 2006 with
high fever and in severe respiratory distress, classic bird flu
symptoms. He died on the morning of 1 Feb 2006.
According to Bandung regency's health office, some chickens
reportedly died near the boy's house shortly before he became ill.

An Indonesian teenager died of avian influenza after he came into
contact with dead chickens, health officials said today, citing local
test results. Blood and swab samples for the 15-year-old boy have
been sent to a World Health Organisation-sanctioned laboratory in
Hong Kong for confirmation, said Runizar Roesin, of the bird flu
information centre. If the tests come back positive, the boy -- who
died yesterday in the city of Bandung -- will be Indonesia's 15th
confirmed human bird flu death.
Health officials are also awaiting WHO confirmation for a market
vendor who died last week after coming into contact with sick poultry.
Hundreds of millions of chickens and ducks have died or been culled
since the H5N1 strain of bird flu started ravaging poultry stocks
across Asia in 2003. It has also jumped to humans, killing at least
85 people in Asia and in Turkey.
Meanwhile, Hong Kong officials have isolated 3 people in a hospital
and closed aviaries and a nature reserve after discovering the H5N1
virus in a wild bird and a chicken smuggled from mainland China [The
3 patients are no longer considered to be suspected cases: see
following report. - Mod.CP]. A dead crested myna was found in a
playground and had the H5N1 bird flu virus, according to preliminary
tests yesterday, said Thomas Sit, acting assistant director of the
Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department. Hong Kong has
found bird flu in dead wild birds in recent weeks, but it's the first
time the disease has been detected in chicken -- a staple in local
Chinese cuisine.
It was not immediately known where in mainland China the chickens
came from, or how they were smuggled into Hong Kong, Tsang said. He
said it was not clear whether the sick chicken was infected in Hong
Kong or China, but it was only in Hong Kong for a few days before
becoming ill and dying. The villager with the infected chicken lived
near the border with mainland China where 2 dead oriental magpie
robins infected with bird flu were found earlier.

Preliminary laboratory tests for H5N1 avian influenza virus came up
negative for 3 people in Hong Kong who were isolated after a chicken
they had kept was found to have been infected with the deadly virus.
The chicken was brought illegally into Hong Kong from mainland China
a week ago and fell ill and died a few days later. Health experts do
not know if it contracted the virus in China or Hong Kong, raising
the worrying prospect of a possible bird flu outbreak in the populous
southern province of Guangdong.
The 3 people -- a 78-year-old woman, a 39-year-old woman and a man
aged 42 -- not only came into contact with the infected chicken but
also ate another that had been in contact with the infected bird in
their village near the Chinese border.
The government has said none of the 3 had a fever, but all of them
had been given the anti-viral drug Tamiflu as a precaution. All 3
remain isolated in hospital under close observation.
While H5N1 mostly affects birds, it has infected 160 people and
killed 85 of them in 6 countries. Experts fear it could mutate to
spread easily between humans and spark a pandemic that could kill
millions. The virus made its first known jump to humans in Hong Kong,
a major world air travel hub, in 1997. The former British colony's
last confirmed human cases of H5N1 were 3 years ago when a father and
son became ill. They were suspected to have contracted the disease in
mainland China.

Specimens from Iraq's first reported case of human infection with the
H5N1 avian influenza virus have now been tested at a WHO
collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom. The case was a
15-year-old girl from the northern part of the country who died of
severe respiratory disease on 17 Jan 2006. Test results have now
confirmed her infection.
Specimens from the girl's 39-year-old uncle, who died on 27 Jan 2006,
and a 54-year-old woman under treatment for respiratory illness are
being sent to the UK laboratory but have not yet arrived.
A joint WHO/FAO/OIE team of international experts has been despatched
to Iraq at the request of the Ministry of Health. The initial small
team of epidemiologists and experts on animal disease will conduct a
rapid assessment of the situation in the Sulaimaniyah area of
northern Iraq. Because of the security situation, the team is not
expected to arrive in the area until early next week.
At present, an additional 2 people showing symptoms suggestive of
H5N1 infection have been hospitalized for treatment in the
Sulaimaniyah area. Health officials, with support from WHO staff,
have set up an emergency operations room to respond to the outbreak,
investigate rumours, and address public concerns. Rumours of possible
human cases in other parts of the country have been systematically
followed up. To date, no such rumours have been substantiated.
The detection of the country's first human case occurred despite the
absence of confirmed outbreaks of the disease in poultry. Detection
of the case indicates a high level of awareness of the clinical
features of this disease and good vigilance on the part of
clinicians. It also points to an urgent need to investigate the
extent of bird outbreaks in northern Iraq and possibly elsewhere.
Team members with veterinary expertise will assess animal health
issues and support the government in its efforts to control the
spread of the disease in poultry.
Experiences with poultry outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian
influenza in other countries have shown how quickly this virus can
establish itself in poultry populations and spread widely when
detection and control measures are delayed. Poultry culling is under
way in northern Iraq and large numbers of birds have already been destroyed.
WHO-led teams are currently conducting or completing field
assessments in nine countries in the area: Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Egypt, Georgia, Iran, Lebanon, Moldova, Syria, and Ukraine.

A 15-year-old Kurdish girl in northern Iraq definitely died of H5N1
bird flu. The UK laboratory that tested the case for the World Health
Organization has confirmed its finding to New Scientist. Confusion
surrounded her previous test results and it is still unclear whether
the girl's uncle also died of the disease, or how many of another 12
feared cases in the area are also bird flu.
The delays that have dogged H5N1 diagnosis wherever the virus has
spread could prove critical to any efforts to contain a pandemic. The
girl died on 17 Jan 2006 and 2 days later the WHO declared Iraqi
tests had shown she had not died of bird flu. There were also no
reports of dead chickens in the area. Fortunately, her doctors asked
for a 2nd opinion. On Mon 30 Jan 2006, the US Navy Medical Research
Unit in Cairo, Egypt, confirmed H5N1 in samples from the girl. On
Tuesday evening, the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR)
at Mill Hill in London, one of the WHO's official collaborating
centres for flu, also confirmed the virus.
"When we get a positive, we are sure," Alan Hay at the NIMR told New
Scientist. "But when we get a negative, we are not. One problem is
getting a sample with virus in it. The amount of virus present during
the course of bird flu in humans varies more than with human flu. And
test samples are usually mucus from the nose or throat. But because
H5N1 is a bird virus, it prefers the higher temperatures and the more
bird-like cell-surface molecules of the lower lungs. But sometimes
positive diagnoses can be also false." The London lab has re-tested
samples from 21 people that Turkey's central laboratory had declared
positive for bird flu. Only 12 were confirmed, including all 4 known
fatalities.
"The now-negative samples might have degraded between tests. We have
to look carefully at the victims' symptoms and circumstances before
we decide," said Hay. "A problem is that one common test for the
virus, amplifying any viral genes using a process called RT-PCR
(reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) is tricky and
notoriously subject to contamination. Another, looking for antibodies
to H5N1 in the blood, does not work until well into an infection, and
the standard test kits which are designed for human flu, sometimes
miss bird flu."
But leaving the diagnostic tests to the world's scattered experts
takes time, for local approval, transportation and then testing. "In
the early days of an epidemic, when it is not clear whether the virus
is in a country or not, it is important that tests be completely
reliable," said Albert Osterhaus of Erasmus University in Rotterdam
in the Netherlands. "Better a little delay than a result you are not sure of."
