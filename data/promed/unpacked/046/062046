A large outbreak of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis recently occurred among
a group of secondary school students who visited two chambers of a cave at
a rural location of Miranda State, Venezuela, about 100 Km east of Caracas.
The "Alfredo Jahn" cave is the second largest in the country, being crossed
by a stream of water during most of the local rainy season, which lasts
from May to November. It has a horizontal development of 4,292 m and a 67 m
slope. Inner temperature ranges between 22 degrees C and 26 degrees C. The
cave is permanently inhabited by at least three species of bats, including
a common insect eating species (_Pterotnotus parnellii_), one omnivorous
species (_Phylostomus hastatus_), and a vampire bat (_Desmodus rotundus_).
A thick layer of bat guano covered the floor of the chambers visited by the
group, and the ground was noted to be dry.
Thirty four students and a teacher entered the cave to make observations
and collect samples of soil and rocks for a biology project. Twenty eight
students (17 females, 11 males; age range 15-18, median age 17) were
available for clinical and immunological evaluation. They remained in the
cave an average of 20 minutes. Twenty (71.4%) of the 28 students evaluated
became either acutely ill (64.3% of them) within 10-28 days (median 14
days); or else developed characteristic x-ray and laboratory abnormalities
(7.1%). The teacher, a 39-year old otherwise healthy male, also became ill
14 days after the exposure.
Sign and symptoms among the 18 ill students included fever (77.7%),
non-productive cough (72.2%), headache (66.6%), nausea and vomiting (50%),
rash (38.8%), abdominal pain (38.8%) asthenia (33.3%), chest pain (22.2%),
dyspnea (16.6%), myalgias (16.6%), and in one case (5.5%) erythema nodosum
or jaundice. Overall, 46.4% of the 28 students, and 65% of those who
developed clinical and/or laboratory abnormalities showed a positive
specific immunodiffusion test within 6-12 weeks.

[Cave-associated histoplasmosis is a well-known entity. I asked Dr. Torres
to discuss histoplasmosis in Venezuela and whether there have been previous
cave-associated outbreaks in that country, and his reply is below. -Man.

Regarding your specific queries, although histoplasmosis is known to occur
in the country and occasional isolated cases are recognized among
immunocompetent patients, as well as among AIDS cases, information on its
prevalence in local general population and specific higher risk groups, or
the environmental distribution of the infection in the country is either
very scarce or non-existent. We are aware of only one previous local report
in 1955, documenting an outbreak of cave-associated disease in another
location, and the isolation of _H. capsulatum_ from the soil of three
unrelated caves in 1958. One of our main concerns is the fact that the cave
involved in the current outbreak is often visited by unprotected groups
belonging to educational institutions or by tourists. Moreover, during the
last couple of years, two of the authors have identified several cases of
acute infection after exposure to the same cave. Due to its high level of
humidity and the fact that an internal stream of water crosses the main
access galleries during most of the year, the cave was not considered to be
a favorable environment for aerosol-related infections.
As a consequence of our recent experience, an attempt will be made to carry
out, in combination with the Venezuelan Speleological Society, a survey of
the distribution of _Histoplasma_ in the soil of the most visited caves in
the country, in order to make specific recommendations for the protection
of visitors.
We are persuaded that the diffusion of epidemiological information of this
kind is of potential benefit to practitioners both in Venezuela and abroad,
who deal with travelers to the region, and may help preventing further
cases of infection among visitors as well.

[ProMED-mail is grateful for this report, which has not yet been published.
Histoplasmosis is due (in the Western hemisphere) to the dimorphic mould
_Histoplasma capsulatum_. This organism grows to very high concentrations
in bird and bat guano. Documented cases and outbreaks of bat-associated
histoplasmosis have occurred among spelunkers and others exposed to bat
excreta. Cases of bat-associated histoplasmosis have been documented not
only in known endemic areas in North America and Central America, but also
in parts of the world where histoplasmosis is uncommon, such as Israel and
Australia. - Man. Ed. DS
