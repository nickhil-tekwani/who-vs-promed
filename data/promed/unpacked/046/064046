Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in South Kazakhstan Oblast
----------------------------------------------------------
A new case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has been
registered in the South Kazakhstan Oblast [region]. A 27 year old man
was admitted to the local infectious disease hospital on 25 Jun 2011
with suspected CCHF. Laboratory tests have confirmed the diagnosis.
The patient's condition is currently moderate and he is improving.

This case is the 2nd in South Kazakhstan this year [2011]. The 1st
case was in May 2011, which resulted in a fatal outcome. The victim
had been bitten by a tick during sheep shearing. None of the victim's
co-workers or contacts have become infected.

[The occupation of this new case of CCHF is not stated, but
agricultural workers are at high risk of CCHF virus infection if
bitten by ticks during the course of their work.

A description of the South Kazakhstan Region is available at
