[A] strange banana disease is ravaging plantations in Kabarole [district, Western Region]. According to the residents, the fruits turn yellowish as if they are ripe and others turn rust brown. One resident said that the affected fruits first appear as grey and dusty turning rusty. As the fruits continue to grow, sometimes the peel cracks. The unidentified disease is rendering the affected bananas unmarketable.

[The farmers] said they have on several occasions sought help from extension officers from their area but they are yet to receive any help. [A] village chairperson said the disease has ravaged a lot of plantations for around 2 months. He said he talked to the agricultural officer who affirmed that the disease would disappear on the onset of rain which has not been the case. [A] sub county chairperson said they are working with the district authorities to find a lasting solution to the problem.

[A number of banana pathogens have been reported from the region, for example, _Banana bunchy top virus_; bacterial wilt (in central Africa caused by _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_, BXW); fungal diseases including black and yellow sigatoka (_Mycosphaerella_ species), Panama disease (_Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_, including tropical race 4, TR4), anthracnose (_Colletotrichum_ species). (For more information, see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives.)

In Uganda, BXW first appeared in 2001 (ProMED-mail post 20020105.3162) and has been spreading in the region since then. An outbreak of anthracnose in the Western Region was suspected in 2020 (ProMED-mail post 20200214.6987577). While BXW can cause premature ripening of fruit, as described above, the overall syndrome in Kabarole otherwise does not resemble BXW or anthracnose and is not sufficient to speculate on the disease or disorder referred to. The problems may also be due to a combination of one or several pathogens and/or other factors. Reliable diagnosis is required as a basis for designing control or management strategies for the affected farmers.
