[2] Algeria, media report, spread

Up to Thu 21 Aug 2014, foot and mouth disease (FMD) affected 23 provinces [in Algeria], while suspected cases were reported in the province of Mostaganem, said Boudoukha Hassan, Director General of the National Institute of Veterinary Medicine (INMV), who stressed that the epidemiological situation is "stable."

The official said Tiaret is the last province affected by the disease on last Sunday, adding veterinary services are currently identifying outbreaks of this disease in Mostaganem pending the results of laboratory analyzes.

Boudoukha added in a statement to APS that the "emergency program" outlined by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to stop the spread of the disease is efficient, and some intermediaries introduced bulls affected by the disease in the eastern borders of the country.

"Thanks to this plan, there have been no cases of FMD in the border provinces of Tunisia, and the Institute collected more than 4000 blood samples from cattle, sheep and goats in this province from 25 Apr to 24 Jul 2014," Boudoukha said.

During the same period, 750 000 cattle were vaccinated, and 15 000 leaflets were distributed to farmers in every province

[In case the suspected outbreak in Mostaganem is confirmed, this will mean a further advance of the disease westwards. The distance between Mostaganem and the Moroccan border is 245 km (152 miles).

According to Algeria's data (OIE annual report, 2013), the national animal population is:
Cattle: 1 909 455 head, held in 214 925 establishments;
Goats: 4 910 700 head, in 206 391 establishments;
Sheep: 26 572 980 head, in 346 031 establishments.

According to the above report, 750 000 cattle were vaccinated. In case this is accurate, this means a vaccination coverage of about 40 percent, much lower than the minimal requirements of 70-80 percent for basic protection, provided a matching vaccine strain is applied. Previous vaccinations in Algeria were reportedly applied with the WA topotype vaccine strains and with the O Manissa vaccine strain, not known to be fully effective against the current serotype O virus strain "O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d" lineage.

The total absence of vaccination in the small ruminant population, which can be victims and/or disseminators of the virus, is another drawback. - Mod.AS]

[3] Morocco, preventive vaccination and other measures

In a new step to deal with foot and mouth disease [FMD] and all the dangers that threaten the national herd, the [Moroccan] Ministry of Agriculture decided to develop a program to digitize the flock and entrusted its implementation to the National Bureau of Health Safety. This has been confirmed by a source familiar with the program, presented during the recent meeting of the Administrative Council of the National Bureau of health safety, in order to confront the FMD threat on the eastern border of the kingdom.

The same source added that the numbering of the national herd will enable the following of cattle movements across the national territory and prevent the spread of infectious diseases. He explained that the process of animal identification will also support effective control upon the safety of animal products on the grounds that the health status of all the slaughtered animals will be well-known. The implementation of the cattle identification process will be gradual.

The Ministry of Agriculture has announced a state of alert in the east in preparation for the possible introduction of FMD to the national herd from Algeria across the border. The national herd counts 2 million cattle. A preventive vaccination campaign began in the eastern provinces, facing Algeria, last Monday [18 Aug 2014].

The veterinarians in the east and southeast have already received sufficient quantities of the vaccine to start the vaccination throughout the area most at risk.

[The previous FMD epizootic in the Maghreb (1999) was, reportedly, caused by the Sudan-Sahel type O strain (WA topotype) from West Africa. Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia managed to control that epizootic by vaccination and animal movement restrictions. While Tunisia and Algeria have maintained a policy of annual vaccinations, applying a bivalent vaccine including serotypes O and A would protect against the relevant (West African) virus strains. Morocco has opted for a non-vaccination policy since 2007. Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia have submitted to the OIE control programme dossiers according to the provisions of chapter 8.6 of the OIE Terrestrial code and were officially endorsed by the OIE in 2012. The current developments are an unfortunate obstacle on the road to achieve the desired FMD-free status (with vaccination in Tunisia and Algeria, without vaccination in Morocco).

The virus strain currently circulating in Tunisia and Algeria and challenging Morocco is of ME-SA (Middle East-South Asia) topotype; more precisely the "O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d" strain, probably originating in the Indian subcontinent. Vaccines designated to protect against the WA topotype, which have been applied in Tunisia and Algeria until recently, may be less adequate to protect against topotype ME-SA strains. The EU has recently supplied 1.1 million doses of a vaccine which included a serotype O vaccine strain which was chosen "following vaccine matching results on the circulating O India 2001 topotype" (see posting 20140804.2659287).

It is hoped that Morocco's (somewhat belated) vaccination campaign, combined with effective animal movement controls, will be sufficient to maintain the country's freedom from FMD. In view of the size of its animal population, this undertaking, while racing against the clock, seems extremely demanding.

The 2013 animal population (OIE data) of Morocco is: 3 172 984 cattle, 6 235 861 goats, 19 956 385 sheep.
If small ruminants remain unvaccinated, the odds are less favorable.

Information on the vaccine valency and the strain(s) to be included in the Moroccan vaccines will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
