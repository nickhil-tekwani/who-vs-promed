Major pest and disease attack on cashews
----------------------------------------
The hot, dry, and foggy weather that has been experienced in southern Dong Nai province has taken its toll on over 3500 ha [8650 acres] of cashew cultivations. It has [favoured] pest and disease activity, causing such problems as 'than thu' -- a disease caused by the _Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_ fungus, and infestations of stink bugs and thrips.

[Anthracnose diseases are caused by fungi and can affect a wide range of crops. In cashew, _Glomerella cingulata_ (previously _Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_) has been reported to be the main pathogen associated with anthracnose. Symptoms on tree crops usually include dark lesions on leaves, stems, and fruit. Disease development is usually favoured by humid conditions. Economic losses are due to reduced yield and severe reduction of fruit quality before and after harvest.

On woody species, the fungi generally have a long saprophytic survival ability on dead twigs and fallen leaves, which are often the main sources of inoculum for such crops. Spread may occur with infected plant material, by mechanical means (including insect and human activities), and water splash. Disease management requires diligent fungicide programmes with critical times during flowering and fruit set, but may also include phytosanitation to reduce inoculum and cultural measures to reduce moisture in plantings.

The high level of cashew pest activity reported above may have contributed to the spread of the disease. _G. cingulata_ has also been reported affecting coffee crops elsewhere in the country (see ProMED-mail post 20110805.2358).
