Salmonella found in food eaten by mass poisoning victims
------------------------------------------------
Laboratory sample tests have found that salmonella was present in the food
that poisoned 89 people a few days ago in northeast China's Liaoning province.
The cause of the mass poisoning will be confirmed by further tests on the
blood of the victims, who showed symptoms after eating in a restaurant in
Benxi county Mon evening, 24 May 2004 and Tue noon, 25 May.
All the victims were hospitalized with sickness, diarrhea, fever and even
shock. To date, 9 victims have been discharged from hospital, and the
remaining inpatients are in basically stable condition.
The restaurant has been ordered to suspend business by the local health
department.
