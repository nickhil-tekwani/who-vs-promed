Re: [Infected birds are apparently moving west, both north and south of the
Great Lakes, and being preyed on by crows and blue jays which, if they have
not already been infected by mosquito bite will get infected through the
gut. - Mod.JW

In reference to the posting concerning West Nile virus (WNV) infection in
crows by predation, I would come to your defense with the following:
1. The report made by Dr Robert McClean of the USGS Wildlife Health Lab at
the April 2001, International WN Conference in NY. Dr McClean described the
experimental oral infection of crows utilizing experimentally
(intracerebrally I believe) infected young (suckling I believe) mice.
2. In my 25 years of field experience, blue jays are more opportunistic
(omnivorous) than stated in the literature. I have seen them eating small,
dead fish from the bank of a stream and crawfish from small, late summer
residual stream "puddles". I have had them cast a pellet of mouse parts in
my lap when net caught in the wild and I have a photo of one eating a
"roadkill" 13-lined ground squirrel in Illinois!

My observation of blue jays is that they WILL eat other birds - I've seen
it happen! When I was a kid, they wiped out a nest of cardinal chicks in
our lilac bush. This was many years ago in Chicago Illinois USA. Where I
live now, in McHenry Illinois USA, blue jays are known to be aggressively
predatory birds. There are many that stop off in my yard, and a group of
them once ganged up on two cats that had downed one of their members in my
front yard. I have no doubt this virus could be passed to them through the
oral route, it does not necessarily mean it would come through carrion only.
