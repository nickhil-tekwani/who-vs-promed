Samples from 9 wild boar found dead in the public hunting lands of Savior Demensky [district] in Kaluga region on the border with the Smolensk region have tested positive for the African swine fever virus [ASFV], according to Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance].

Russia's animal health service reports that the outbreak is under control there as state veterinary service specialists are treating the findings as a priority.

The last outbreak of African swine fever in the region was in January [2014], in domestic pigs at a private farm in the Ferzikovo district [Kaluga region].

[The 9 ASF cases in wild boars mentioned have been reported by Russia to the OIE in follow-up report no 13, dated 20 Jun 2014. In the same report, a single case in a domestic pig (out of 36 susceptible animals) in another location in the same region (Kaluzhskaya/Kaluga Oblast) was reported as well. See, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=15437.

On 23 Jun 2014, a single dead wild boar was reported in the Tverskaya/Tver Oblast; see follow-up report no 14 at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=15469.

A parallel ASF event has been continuous in another region (Volgogradskaya/Volgograd Oblast) since 1 Jan 2014, so far involving 8 outbreaks. Follow-up report no 8, submitted on 20 Jun 2014, informs about the 8th outbreak, where 4 domestic pigs were found dead and tested positive, out of 16 susceptible animals on the holding. The remaining animals have, reportedly, not been culled. Details on all 8 outbreaks since the start of this event, and an interactive map, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=14673.

ASF has been spreading in Russia since December 2007, when it was introduced into Chechnya from Georgia. Since then, it has become established throughout the European parts of the Russian Federation from south to north, affecting wild boars and domestic swine and threatening neighbouring countries.
