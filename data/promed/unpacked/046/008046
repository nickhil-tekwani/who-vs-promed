[The location of the outbreak can be seen on the map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.

During 2013, China has reported 4 outbreaks of FMDV serotype A, as follows:
1. Guangdong: immediate notification submitted 1 Mar 2013, reason for submission "new strain", controlled by stamping out, "no vaccination" (ProMED-mail posting 20130302.1567750).
2. Qinghai: immediate notification submitted 18 Mar 2013, reason for submission "new strain", controlled by stamping out, "no vaccination" (ProMED-mail posting 20130319.1594167).
3. Xinjiang: immediate notification submitted 16 Apr 2013 , reason for submission "reoccurrence of a listed disease", controlled by stamping out, "no vaccination" (ProMED-mail posting 20130417.1653403).
4. (the current event) in Tibet: reason for submission given as "new strain", stamping out, no vaccination.

It is not clear why outbreaks 2 and 4 are reportedly related to "new strains"; were their respective causative agents of distinct different genotypes, and different from the one causing outbreak 1 (Guangdong)?

The appearance of the same FMDV serotype in distant locations within the mega State may be seen as indicative of its wide circulation.

Are we wrong to assume that infection, in an apparently unvaccinated, susceptible cattle population, of a highly infectious virus such as FMD, is not limited to the 4 reported outbreaks?

During 2013, FMDV serotype A has been reported from 2 of China's neighbours, namely the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. - Mod.AS
