A sweeping epidemic of hemorrhoids (sic) fever has broken out in
the town of Pokhvistnevo in the Samara region. Sixty-two
people diagnosed with fever have been hospitalized there in recent
month (sic). Practically all the victims have been infected in the
woods of nearby fields during harvesting.
Research has shown that around 30 percent of rodents in the
region are carriers of the hazardous virus. When a period of cold
weather set in in the woods, the mice ran for shelter to basements,
sheds and houses. Medical personnel believe that the epidemic of
the "mouse fever" is the recurrence of a previous epidemic in 1997
when 2000 people fell ill in the Samara region.
The local authorities have been taking urgent measures to liquidate
rodents in the affected areas.
