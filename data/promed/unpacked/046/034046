Bird flu hits one more Vietnamese province
-------------------------------------------
Bird flu has stricken Viet Nam's central Nghe An province, killing
about 300 ducks, said an official with the Department of Animal
Health under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on
Tuesday [7 Oct 2008]. The ducks raised by a household in the province
started to die recently. The specimens collected from the dead ducks
have been tested positive to bird flu virus strain H5N1, said the
unnamed official.

Local health department have slaughtered all the fowls in the
affected spot and disinfected this area to guard against any further
outbreaks of bird flu.

Now, bird flu is hitting 2 Vietnamese provinces, including Ca Mau and
Nghe An [see commentary].

Bird flu outbreaks in Viet Nam, starting in December 2003, have
killed and led to the forced culling of dozens of millions of fowls
in the country.
