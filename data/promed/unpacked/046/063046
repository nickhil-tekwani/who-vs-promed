Race is on to control banana disease
------------------------------------
Agriculture experts in the region are exerting efforts to control the
spread of banana bunchy top disease in Cagayan Valley, a perennial
problem of banana farmers [in Isabela State]. Government agriculture
workers and researchers are doing regular rounds to rehabilitate
affected areas and protect other banana-producing places to improve
the productivity of farmers in the region, according to Dr Billy
Temanel, research and development chief of the Isabela State.

University agriculture records show that banana bunchy top disease
first occurred in Quirino province years ago but due to inaction, a
build-up of the plant virus inoculums ensued and the disease spread
throughout the region. At least 7175 hectares [17 730 acres] planted
with bananas in Quirino province have been infected with the disease
in the past years. The disease then occurred in other banana farms
each year. Efforts to contain the problem helped minimize its
occurrence, Temanel said.

The Cagayan Valley Agricultural Research and Development made a
series of probes to collect, measure, and identify all factors that
contribute to the growth and spread of the disease by identifying the
characteristics of the sites, the land use patterns, age and type of
plantations, farmer practices, adjacent vegetation and forest
patches, rainfall, and other climatic patterns, he added. Surveys
were done in Quirino, Nueva Vizcaya, and Isabela provinces.

[2] Bunchy top and mosaic diseases, abaca - central provinces and Mindanao

In 2007, the Philippines produced 60 000 tons of abaca fiber, known
commercially as Manila hemp. It is a major source of income to small
farmers and is grown on about 127 258 hectares [315 000 acres]. Many
abaca farms are ravaged by mosaic and bunchy top virus diseases.

Conventional breeding for disease resistance had been futile. The
Institute of Plant Breeding at the University of the Philippines --
Los Banos made a recent breakthrough in developing lakatan [cultivar]
banana resistant to bunchy top disease through irradiation.
Scientists believe virus-resistant abaca could be developed from these by 2012.

Disease-ravaged plantations can be rehabilitated by planting
disease-free seedlings.

[A number of viruses can affect the members of genus _Musa_, which
includes species and hybrids representing wild and cultivated
bananas, plantains (cooking bananas), and abaca (_Musa textilis_).

_Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV; genus _Babuvirus_) only affects
_Musa_ species and causes one of the most serious diseases of these
crops. It is transmitted by the banana aphid (_Pentalonia
nigronervosa_) but can also be spread with infected suckers and
tissue cultures. For more information on BBTV see ProMED-mail post
no. 20090127.0372 and links below.

While mosaic-like symptoms on _Musa_ species may be due to several
viruses (for example, _Banana mild mosaic virus_, _Banana bract
mosaic virus_, _Sugarcane mosaic virus_, and even _Banana streak
virus_), the term 'mosaic' in item 2 most likely refers to the
disease caused by certain strains of _Cucumber mosaic virus_ (CMV;
genus _Cucumovirus_) on _Musa_ species (this disease is also called
infectious chlorosis or heart rot). CMV is spread by several species
of aphids, mechanical means, with infected plant material, and has
also been reported to be seed transmitted in banana. For more
information on CMV see ProMED-mail post no. 20080505.1533.

Control of these viruses is difficult since aphid vectors and virus
reservoirs are widespread. Disease management may include removal of
inoculum, use of clean planting material, and use of
resistant/tolerant crop varieties for replanting. As reported above,
radiation (and other mutagens) may be used to increase spontaneous
mutation rates and enhance the chances that resistant mutants may
arise. These novel genes can then be introduced into commercial crop
varieties by traditional breeding methods.
