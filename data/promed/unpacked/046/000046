2 Apr 2015: Liberia, Sierra Leone gain in Ebola crisis; Guinea struggles

[Ebola continues to spread in Guinea even as Liberia and Sierra Leone appear to be close to having the virus under control. Yet Guinea has experienced the lowest number of cases overall, most likely a consequence of the virus not "exploding in a major Guinean city, as it did in the capitals of Sierra Leone and Liberia, said Dr. Dan Jernigan of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention." - Mod.LK]

3 Apr 2015 USA (CDC MMWR 64(12);321-323): Ebola virus disease in a humanitarian aid worker -- New York City, October 2014

[NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) actively monitored 3 close contacts of the patient and 114 health care personnel. No secondary cases of Ebola were detected. DOHMH actively monitored 114 health care personnel based on 3 criteria: direct patient care responsibilities, entry into the patient's room, and handling of non-decontaminated laboratory specimens. Monitored personnel included 7 FDNY-EMS workers, 1 from the DOHMH laboratory, and 106 at Bellevue Hospital Center. The 106 hospital workers included clinical (38), laboratory (42), environmental management (22), transport, and support staff members. All 114 personnel reported using appropriate personal protective equipment without any known breach and were categorized as low (but not zero) risk as directed by CDC guidance of October 2014 (2). Response costs were high in both human resources and money: DOHMH alone spent USD 4.3 million]

http://gcn.com/articles/2015/04/03/ebola-modeling-floods.aspx
[The model, originally created to help health-care workers in Ebola-active parts of Liberia figure out where to best establish central resource centers, used information on demographics, family structures, travel patterns and activities to help model what would potentially happen as the disease spread. 2 graduate students in Virginia Bioinformatics Institute (VBI) -- Virginia Tech's genetics, bioinformatics and computational biology program, realized they could adapt the Ebola model for use in local emergency response to flooding. It took them about 30 volunteer hours during an open-data "hackathon" to find their solution]
