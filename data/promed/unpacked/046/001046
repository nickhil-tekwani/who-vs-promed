BLASTOMYCOSIS - ILLINOIS, USA: RFI

I work for the Illinois Riverwatch Network, a statewide volunteer stream
monitoring program. We have recently learned, through a landowner, that this
site is "contaminated" with a pathogenic fungus, blastomycosis. Does anyone
out there know of this organism? Is there a species or variety that lives
in moist soil areas? What conditions does this organism live under - for
example - is this fungus related to high organic/nutrient input?
I have contacted the local state authorities and they knew as much as I did.
I'm helping them gather more info on this situation.

[Blastomycosis is an uncommon fungus that is found in parts of central & SE
USA, Canada, Africa, India, Israel & Saudi Arabia. The reservoir is soil. It
can infect humans, dogs and cats, and may produce an acute disease with
cough, or a very mild disease that goes unrecognised until it has spread
throughout the body, eventually producing skin lesions on the face &
extremities, weight loss and, if untreated, ending fatally. It can be
diagnosed by finding typical fungal bodies in sputum, and can be treated
with ketoconazole or amphotericin B.
