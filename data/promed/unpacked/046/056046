EU urged to stop feeding tuna farms with fish
---------------------------------------------
EU states should stop using fish as feed in tuna farms, which risks
spreading exotic viruses to the Mediterranean, environmental group WWF
[World Wildlife Fund] said on Wednesday [4 May 2005].
The EU's farmed tuna industry, dominated by Spain, buys more than 200 000
tonnes of mostly frozen and untreated fish annually from the North Atlantic,
West Africa and South America. Nearly all Europe's farmed tuna exports go to
Japan.
"A huge amount of fish is dumped into the Mediterranean to feed tuna and
this brings a risk of exotic diseases," said Sergi Tudela, WWF's
Mediterranean Fisheries Coordinator.
"The fact it is concentrated in just a few places makes the disease risk
much higher," he told reporters. WWF has asked the European Commission, the
EU executive, to ban non-Mediterranean fish for tuna farms and use feed
pellets instead, he said.
Europe's tuna farming is driven mainly by demand for sushi and sashimi in
Japan, the world's largest consumer of fresh and frozen tuna, and
destination for more than 90 percent of the EU's farmed tuna exports.
Spain, particularly its southeastern region of Murcia, runs most of the EU's
45-odd tuna farms. Malta and Italy are also major players and, outside the
European Union bloc, Turkey and Croatia.
WWF said up to a quarter of Mediterranean farmed tuna comes from Murcia,
where more than 56 000 tonnes of baitfish are introduced into a 170-km (105
mile) coastal stretch every year.
Between 15 and 25 kilos (33 and 55 lb) of fish feed are needed to produce
one kilo of tuna, it said in a study. The fish used as feed are usually
small-sized species such as herring that do not live in Mediterranean waters.
"We don't know which viruses are in the imported fish and how they might
affect fish in the Mediterranean," Tudela said.
The Commission, which regulates EU fishing policy, said it would study WWF's
proposal and ask the tuna industry for data.
"We are sensitive to this and we will talk to the tuna farming industry to
see what action we can take," one Commission official told Reuters.

[Obviously the sensitivity and subsequently the response of international
authorities to possible risks related to recycling procedures, have
significantly increased since the emergence of the BSE saga.
