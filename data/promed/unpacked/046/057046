Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Thailand
-------------------------------------------------------------------
On [24 Jan 2016], the National IHR Focal Point of Thailand notified WHO of 1 laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. This is the country's 2nd case of MERS-CoV infection (see DON published on [10 Jul 2015]).

Details of the case
The case is a 71-year-old Omani national who arrived in Bangkok, Thailand on [22 Jan 2016]. The patient travelled to Thailand to seek medical care. Once in Bangkok, the patient was admitted to hospital. On [23 Jan 2016], he tested positive for MERS-CoV.

The patient, who has comorbidities, 1st developed symptoms on [14 Jan 2016] while in Oman. On [18 Jan 2016], he was admitted to hospital. On [21 Jan 2016], against medical advice, the patient self-discharged from hospital. The patient was sampled before leaving the hospital. The sample tested positive for MERS-CoV on [25 Jan 2016], after the patient had already left Oman.

On [24 Jan 2016], the National IHR Focal Point of Oman was informed about the case for the necessary follow up on contacts back in Oman and investigation of history of exposure. Investigations revealed that the case had contacts with camels in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. No epidemiological links have been established between this case and the latest case detected in Oman.

Measures are being taken to trace all contacts of the cases in Oman, during his journey to Thailand, and within Bangkok.

Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1633 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 587 related deaths.
