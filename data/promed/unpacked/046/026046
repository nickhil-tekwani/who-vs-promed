A third case of anthrax in cattle has been detected on a central Alberta
farm. The case was discovered July 24 at Caroline, Alta., when a single
animal was found dead, said veterinary program officer Doug Scott of the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).
The latest outbreak is about 16 kilometers away from the other 2 cases
discovered at the end of June near Rocky Mountain House.
All three farms are under quarantine. So far, 21 animals have died.
Vets from the CFIA supervised burial of the infected carcasses. The bodies
were incinerated and buried in lined pits.
The topsoil where the animals were found was scraped off and thrown into
the pit to destroy any spores that may have developed when body fluid
leaked into the ground.
Remaining livestock on the premises was vaccinated. Producers on
neighboring farms have been told of the outbreak and were advised to
vaccinate their livestock.
As for vaccinating animals on other farms, Scott said producers should
contact their veterinarian before taking action. "Anybody who has
livestock should consult their private veterinary livestock practitioner.
He knows the history of the area."
Scott said 1999 has been an anthrax year for Alberta, but he cautions that
the cases discovered so far are part of a localized outbreak.
It is one of the oldest livestock diseases known. Anthrax is a fatal
disease in livestock. It appears to be caused by soil borne bacteria that
spread the disease by spores.
Animals eat grass close to the ground, ingest the spores, get sick and die
soon after. Anthrax does not appear to be spread from one animal to another.
Anthrax is difficult to diagnose in live animals because it kills so
quickly. Symptoms that may appear immediately before death are high
temperatures, bloody discharge and swelling in the neck and shoulder areas.
However, most animals die before any other symptoms are noticed, said Scott.
Animals that die of anthrax show no signs of rigor mortis. Unclotted blood
leaks from their orifices [in some cases.
It is difficult to determine the exact source of an anthrax outbreak. Once
the disease has occurred in an area, there is always the possibility of
recurrence depending on environmental conditions.
Anthrax spores can survive for years in soil and water. They are usually
exposed at the surface through environmental conditions such as erosion,
flooding or excavations on the land.

[The tight clustering of these outbreaks must raise questions. Some
livestock spread is possible for 5 - 10 kms by horse-flies and shorter
distances, 3m to 200m, by blow-flies depositing spores on long grazing. One
is tempted to ask the question of whether there had been any sudden deaths
in the intervening livestock between Rocky Mountain House and this latest
outbreak. If so, one would also have to ask if there was any riverine
connection between the two areas, as in the Victoria outbreak in Australia.
