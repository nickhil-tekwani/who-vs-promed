Prolonged spells of rain in 2011 increased the number of malaria cases
in the state compared to 2010. However, the cause for concern was the
increase in the cases of fatal _Plasmodium falciparum_ (PF). It
increased by almost 30 percent in 2011 as compared to the
corresponding period in 2010.

In Rajasthan, malaria cases registered from January 2010 to December
2010 were 51 000 but by the end of November 2011 (from January 2011),
the number increased to 53 000.

By the end of November 2011, there was an increase of 2000 malaria
cases. But, the fact that worries the medical, health, and family
welfare department is that among the 2000 increased cases, there were
around 1000 increased cases of dangerous _Plasmodium falciparum_
malaria.

Last year [2010], among the total 51 000 malaria cases there were 2000
PF malaria cases. But, in 2011 (till November) the PF cases increased
to 2900. The medical, health, and family welfare department claimed
that the prolonged rainfall is the cause of more malaria cases
reported this year. Additional director (RH) Dr JP Dhamija said, "This
year there was prolonged rain for 2 more months. The mosquitoes got
conducive environment for breeding due to waterlogging. But, we tried
our best through anti-larvae activities and controlled malaria from
spreading."

In Jaipur, the cases of malaria cases increased this year [2011]. A
department official said that between January 2010 and November 2010
the total malaria cases were 1192, but during the corresponding period
in 2011 the figure increased to 1763.

in the past 10 months, 13 CRPF [Central Reserve Police Force]
personnel died and 11 others became seriously ill due to dengue and
malaria in Naxal-hit states [Chhattisgarh, Orissa, West Bengal, and
Jharkhand], Rajya Sabha [Council of States] was informed.

Minister of State for Home Jitendra Singh said adequate preventive
measures are being taken for the safety of the force from these
diseases.

Singh said apart from other measures, a clear cut plan has been made
and kept at each unit for casualty evacuation in case of emergency.

It consists of details of the nearest hospitals, their phone numbers,
distance, stretcher etc. Also, the men have been trained to rise to
any emergency situation for early evacuation of seriously ill
patients.

[Malaria is endemic in Rajasthan and parts of Chhattisgarh, Orissa,
West Bengal, and Jharkhand. Reports from India are so frequent that
ProMED-mail will bring the reports from the past week once or twice a
month.

The phrase "Naxal" refers to a violent Maoist movement.
