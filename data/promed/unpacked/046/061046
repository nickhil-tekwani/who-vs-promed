From: James E. Cheek, MD, MPH <jcheek@dpssyg.hqw.ihs.gov>

Transmission apparently occurred at a location over 9,000 ft (>3,000 m)
elevation, currently under about six feet of snow. Winter cases in Arizona
previously have been restricted to Lower Sonoran desert, up to 2,000 ft
(>650 m) elevation. Although this case is similar to some cases in Montana
in which transmission was associated with small mammals over-wintering in
barns and bunkhouses, this is a first for the Southwest.

[Thanks, Jim, for the prompt reply and interesting epidemiologic
observation. Whereas when most of us think of Arizona we think of heat,
arid, desert landscape with cactuses, that is not all there is to that
remarkable state. It also comprises mountains, high plains, pinyon-juniper
associations, and more. Winters in northern Arizona can be harsh. This
fascinating finding should serve to remind us all of the variety of the
Arizona landscape and of the remarkable adaptability of (probably) Sin
Nombre virus. - Mod.CHC
