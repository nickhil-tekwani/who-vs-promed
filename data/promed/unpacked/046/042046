Health Ministers Take Action to Improve Health Security Globally
--------------------------------------------------------
OTTAWA -- Ministers and Secretaries of Health and senior officials from
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom, the
United States and the Commissioner of Health and Consumer Protection,
European Union concluded their first meeting on health security and
bioterrorism in Ottawa today. The meeting provided an opportunity to
discuss a more coordinated approach to improving the health security of
citizens, and to better prepare for and respond to acts of terrorism, in
the aftermath of 11 Sep 2001.
Following the meeting, the participants issued a statement calling for
concerted global action to strengthen the public health response to the
threat of international biological, chemical and radio-nuclear terrorism.
OTTAWA PLAN FOR IMPROVING HEALTH SECURITY
Ottawa, 7 Nov 2001
1. We, Health Ministers/Secretaries/Commissioner, have consistently
condemned in the strongest terms all forms of biological, chemical, and
radio-nuclear terrorism and in particular the acts of terrorism that have
taken place in the United States. We affirm our resolve as a group of
Health Ministers/Secretaries representing diverse nations to, individually
and collectively, take concerted actions to ensure the health and security
of our citizens, and to enhance our respective capacities to deal with
public health incidents.
2. The events of September 11 have changed the focus of governments. It has
centered our attention on how we assess risks, how we prepare for any
eventuality and how we respond more effectively to public health security
crises. It has added urgency and determination to further strengthen our
plans, networks and protocols in collaboration with other countries as well
as international organizations. Terrorism, particularly bio-terrorism, is
an international issue, for instance, an outbreak of smallpox anywhere in
the world is a danger to all countries. International collaboration is
essential.
3. We intend to forge a new partnership to address the critical issue of
protecting public health and security. We are committed to working
aggressively to strengthen our readiness and response by increasing
collaboration amongst governments, in partnerships with international
organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO). Recognizing the
wide range of issues that are part of any health security plan, our
objectives for the partnership, within the framework of existing
international agreements are:
- To explore joint cooperation in procuring vaccines and antibiotics;
- To engage in a constructive dialogue regarding the development of rapid
testing, research in variations of vaccines, and our respective regulatory
frameworks for the development of vaccines and in particular smallpox
vaccines;
- To further support the World Health Organization's disease surveillance
network and WHO's efforts to develop a coordinated strategy for disease
outbreak containment;
- To share emergency preparedness and response plans, including contact
lists, and consider joint training and planning;
- To agree on a process for international collaboration on risk assessment
and management and a common language for risk communication;
- To improve linkages among laboratories, including level four
laboratories, in those countries which have them;
- To undertake close cooperation on preparedness and response to
radio-nuclear and chemical events; and
- To share surveillance data from national public health laboratories and
information on real or threatened contamination of food and water supplies
along with information on risk mitigation strategies to ensure safe food
supplies.
4. To urgently take this process forward, each of us will designate a
senior official to be the point person to ensure that this Plan is
translated into concrete actions. Officials from each country will meet
without delay to flesh out specific measures of this Plan. In addition,
these senior officials constitute a network of rapid communication/reaction
in case of crisis.
5. To ensure follow up, Canada will serve as the coordinating partner to
take the lead in establishing networks, linkages and collaboration agreed
upon today, and to facilitate arrangements for a second ministerial
meeting. Ministers/Secretaries/Commissioner also agreed to broaden this
forum as appropriate to include other governments.
Ministers/Secretaries/Commissioner accepted the offer of the United Kingdom
to host this meeting at an early date. Canada will also coordinate the
early designation of senior officials, the ongoing sharing of best
practices and development of specific proposals for ministerial
consideration, including cooperation on pharmaceuticals and stockpiling issues.
6. We welcome other Health Ministers/Secretaries who stand ready to join in
this effort. The statement was endorsed by the following Health Ministers,
Secretaries and senior officials:
The Honourable Allan Rock, Minister of Health, Canada
Mr. David Byrne, Commissioner of Health and Consumer Protection, European
Union
Mr. Jungoro Kondo, Vice-Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan
L'honorable Bernard Kouchner, Ministre delegue a la Sante, France
The Honourable Julio Frenk, Minister of Health, Mexico
The Right Honourable John Hutton, Minister of State for Health, United Kingdom
