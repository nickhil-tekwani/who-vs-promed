'Candidatus Phytoplasma australiense' is the phytoplasma
associated with Australian grapevine yellows, papaya dieback and
Phormium yellow leaf diseases.
Molecular studies carried out in New Zealand and Australia have shown
that the phytoplasmas associated with Australian grapevine yellows,
papaya dieback and Phormium yellow leaf diseases belong to the same
species. This phytoplasma is distinct from German grapevine yellows
(Vergilbungskrankheit) and stolbur. The name 'Candidatus Phytoplasma
australiense' had previously been proposed for the phytoplasma
associated with Australian grapevine yellows. Phormium yellow leaf
disease is a lethal disease of New Zealand flax (_Phormium tenax_) and
mountain flax (_P. cookianum_), which is only present in New Zealand
(first found in 1908). It is transmitted by a planthopper (_Oliarus
atkinsoni_). Papaya dieback can be a devastating disease in Queensland,
Australia (first found in 1922).
Australian grapevine yellows was first reported in Australia in 1975. No
vectors have been identified for the latter two diseases. The authors
noted that further studies are needed on the possible origin, host range,
vector transmission of 'Candidatus Phytoplasma australiense' and the
relationships between New Zealand and Australian populations.

[The finding that phytoplasmas associated with diseases of grapevine,
papaya and _Phorium_ spp. belong to the same species is a significant
contribution to phytoplasma research. This contribution also illustrates
differences between the Australasian species and the European phytoplasmas.
Recognition of a common phytoplasma associated with diseases in three
different hosts should facilitate better management of the respective
diseases - Mod. DH
