Dr Nii Adjetey, Assin North District Director of Health Services, on Mon,
10 Jul 2006, deplored the insanitary conditions under which most food
vendors operate within the district. He said this had resulted in an
outbreak of cholera within the district, with 40 cases including the death
of a person, recorded within the past 2 weeks.
Dr Adjetey therefore advised the public to desist from buying food from
such vendors and asked the women to ensure clean and healthy surroundings
both at home and where they sell their wares. He stressed that they should
desist from exposing food items to flies and dust.

Four more cholera cases were reported positive after tests, taking the
total count of cholera-affected in Chhani village to 9. Those reported to
be suffering from the disease were residents of susceptible areas like
Bhathuji Nagar, Swaminarayan Faliya, Anjana Farm, as were the earlier
cases. However, health officials said that the patients were not in a
critical condition and were stable.
Chhani Nagarpalika administrator Kiran Desai said that the village was
declared cholera-hit by Vadodara collector Rajiv Topno, in view of the
health situation. Caused by a failure in the functioning of the
chlorination plant and leakages in the water network, the situation in the
village had aggravated with around 100-odd patients seeking treatment at
the Chhani Community Health Center on Mon, 10 Jul 2006.
