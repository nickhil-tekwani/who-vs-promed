Vaccination after COVID-19 hospital stay may protect against long COVID
-------------------------------------------------------------
A study yesterday [22 Mar 2022] in Clinical Microbiology and Infection suggests that natural infection, but not immunity acquired from COVID-19 vaccinations, is linked to the development of long COVID-19, or symptoms that persist up to a year after acute infection.

The prospective study was based on 479 COVID-19 patients originally seen at the Udine Hospital in Italy from March to May 2020. Researchers conducted interviews 6 and 12 months after acute infection, and vaccination status was obtained, as vaccines had become available in the interim. The investigators also obtained 2 different serologic assays to distinguish between response to vaccination (receptor-binding domain [RBD] SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G [IgG]) and to natural infection (non-RBD SARS-CoV-2 IgG).

Of the participants, 47.2% experienced COVID-19 symptoms 1 year after infection, including 85 (30.6%) who reported the onset of new post-COVID-19 symptoms at 12 months. There were no significant differences in the worsening of post-COVID 19 symptoms (22.7% vs 15.8%, P = 0.209) among vaccinated (132) and unvaccinated (347) patients.

The authors said the presence of non-RBD SARS-CoV-2 IgG induced by natural infection showed a significant association with post-COVID-19 syndrome (odds ratio [OR]; 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11 to 1.64; P = 0.003), while the presence of RBD SARS-CoV-2 IgG was not associated with the occurrence of post-COVID-19 syndrome (> 2500 units per milliliter [U/mL] vs 0.9-2500 U/mL, OR 1.36; 95% CI 0.62 to 3.00; P = 0.441).

"The persistence of a high titre serological response induced by natural infection but not by vaccination may play a role in long COVID-19," the authors concluded. "Our findings support the practice of offering SARS-CoV-2 vaccination regardless of infection history and identifies a novel aspect of humoral response in patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome."

US infants and toddlers previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 had significantly higher levels of antibodies against the virus than did adults, found a prospective study [published] yesterday [22 Mar 2022] in JCI Insight.

Researchers with Johns Hopkins University and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention compared concentrations of receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and neutralizing antibodies in serum samples from children 0-17 years old with those from adults aged 18-62.

The analysis used sample from 682 unvaccinated children and adults in 175 Maryland households with at least one child 0-4 years old participating in a COVID-19 surveillance study. Samples were collected from November 2020 through March 2021. Household members were followed up for roughly 8 months.

Among 56 participants with antibodies indicating previous COVID-19 infection, 15 were aged 0-4 years (youngest, 3 months), 13 were aged 5-17 years, and 28 were 18 and older.

Relative to adults, RBD antibody levels in children 0 to 4 years old were 13 times higher and nearly 9 times higher in those aged 5-17. Children 0-4 years old had neutralizing antibody levels twice as high as adults. The study authors said that higher neutralizing antibody levels may indicate greater protection against severe COVID-19.

In 11 of 12 households in which both children and adults had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, those aged 0 to 4 years had the highest levels of both types of antibodies studied.

Only about half of participants with RBD antibodies had been informed by a healthcare provider that they may have COVID-19, which the researchers said could indicate that many asymptomatic or milder infections go unrecognized. No participants were hospitalized for their infections.

"Very young children in our study developed high titers of antibody to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which is the target antigen for COVID vaccines," lead author Ruth Karron said in a Johns Hopkins press release. "These findings should provide some reassurance that with the appropriate vaccine doses we can effectively immunize very young children against SARS-CoV-2."

[3] COVID wave of activity

Date: Wed 23 Mar 2022

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/nhs-under-pressure-from-new-covid-wave-across-england-says-chris-whitty


The NHS is coming under "significant" pressure amid a rise in COVID cases in virtually every area of England, the chief medical officer has warned, with hospitalisations likely to continue increasing at least until April [2022]. Professor Chris Whitty said the mounting numbers of people becoming infected was likely to be largely driven by the new omicron variant, BA.2. The sharp resurgence of the coronavirus underlined that the crisis "is not over", Whitty added.

Speaking at the annual conference of the Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Public Health, Whitty also said those hoping for an "end point" should not expect one, with coronavirus likely to remain a threat to public health for decades. He raised concerns that other areas of public health had "gone backwards" in the last 2 years, including obesity and alcohol. Child obesity rates in particular were now "significantly worse" than they were at the start of the pandemic, he warned.

However, while there was an urgent need to tackle problems in a number of other areas of public health, COVID-19 remained a major threat, he said. "COVID cases are now rising quite rapidly -- from quite a high base -- and this is driven by a number of different factors, of which BA.2, the new omicron variant is a large part. Rates are high and rising in virtually all parts of England."

While the rise in cases was not leading to a surge in deaths, Whitty added, the NHS was seeing increasing numbers of people requiring hospital treatment for COVID. "If we look at hospitalisations, there are now quite significant numbers of people in hospital," he told delegates at the conference. "They are now rising again, and I think will continue to rise for at least the next 2 weeks -- so there is pressure on the NHS. It is currently being driven by omicron rather than new variants, but we need to keep a very close eye on this because at any point new variants could emerge anywhere in the world, including the UK, as happened with the alpha variant."

The number of people in hospital with COVID in 2 regions of England has climbed to the highest level for more than a year. South east England has now joined the south west in recording patient levels last seen in February 2021, surpassing the peaks reached in the previous surge of infections at the start of 2022. A total of 1956 people with COVID-19 were in hospital in the south east on 21 Mar 2022, the highest since 19 Feb 2021, according to new figures from NHS England. And in south west England 1365 patients were recorded on 21 Mar 2022, the highest since 9 Feb 2021. In both regions about half of people in hospital with COVID-19 are being treated primarily for something else rather than coronavirus.

But the continuing rise in patients testing positive for COVID -- up 26% week-on-week in the south west and 20% in the south east -- is another sign of the growing prevalence of the virus across the country. The total number of people in hospital with COVID in England stands at 13 060, the highest figure since 31 Jan 2022. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, said on Monday [21 Mar 2022] that despite the jump in infections and hospital patients, there was "no particular cause for concern".

Figures published on Friday [18 Mar 2022] by the Office for National Statistics showed that infection levels were continuing to rise across most of the UK, with 3.3 million people estimated to have coronavirus in the week to 12 Mar 2022, up from 2.6 million the previous week. Asked by a delegate when the pandemic might end, Whitty said that while COVID would become less dominant over time, it would remain a significant problem across the world "for the rest of our lives".

"Let's have no illusions about that. I'm expecting it to be probably -- in the UK -- seasonal but interspersed at least for the next 2 or 3 years by new variants ... I think we should just accept that is what we're going to deal with and just roll with it rather than expect some end point."

France sees biggest jump in COVID cases since early February 2022
-----------------------------------------------------------------
France saw the biggest jump in new COVID-19 cases since February [2022], health ministry data showed on Tuesday [22 Mar 2022], with 180 777 new infections over 24 hours, and hospital numbers also rose for the 3rd consecutive day. The new cases brought the cumulative number of registered infections to 24.3 million as the resumption of classes following 2 weeks of school holidays marked a sharp resurgence of the epidemic.

The 7-day moving average of new cases rose further to just under 99 000, where it had been from end-December [2021] till mid-February [2022], driven by the contagious omicron variant of the novel coronavirus.

The health ministry also reported that the number of people hospitalised with COVID-19 in France rose by 36 to 20 742 over the past 24 hours, and was down just 0.8% compared to a week ago. Week-on-week the number of patients had been falling steadily since [10 Feb 2022], but the rate of improvement has slowed down in the past few weeks.

French new infections have been increasing again since the beginning of the month [March 2022] but health minister Olivier Veran has said this trend should reverse by the end of March [2022]. Most of the country's COVID-19 restrictions were lifted a few weeks ago.

A 3rd of US COVID now caused by omicron BA.2 as overall cases fall
---------------------------------------------------------------
About 1 in 3 COVID-19 cases in the United States are now caused by the BA.2 omicron sub-variant of the coronavirus, according to government data on Tuesday [22 Mar 2022] that also showed overall infections still declining from January's [2022] record highs. Despite the rise of the extremely contagious sub-variant also seen in other countries, US health experts say a major wave of new infections here appears unlikely. US COVID-19 infections have receded sharply since January [2022], although a resurgence in parts of Asia and Europe have raised concerns that one will follow in the United States given previous patterns during the 2 years of the pandemic.

In the north east, including New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts, omicron BA.2 now makes up more than half the cases, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It accounted for 35% of US infections for the week ending [19 Mar 2022], CDC said. That compares with 22.3% for the week ending [12 Mar 2022], which was revised down from 23.1%, according to a CDC model that estimates proportions of circulating variants.

Top US infectious disease official Dr Anthony Fauci said at a Washington Post event on Tuesday [22 Mar 2022] that he does not believe there will be a major surge soon, "unless something changes dramatically". Still, Fauci noted that cases in the United States generally lag around 3 weeks behind the United Kingdom, "so if we are going to see an uptick, we should start seeing it within the next week or so."

Daniel Kuritzkes, chief of division of infectious diseases at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital, said there was no evidence yet that the rise of BA.2 is pointing to an increase in cases. "I think the one concern and where people need to remain vigilant is that as we have relaxed many restrictions around masking and gathering, there is a potential opportunity for BA.2 or any variant to gain a foothold," Kuritzkes said.

The sub-variant is more transmissible than the omicron BA.1 variant that caused the massive winter surge, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. It does not appear to cause more severe disease, however, and early data showed that infection with BA.1 offers strong protection against reinfection with BA.2, WHO said.

As of [19 Mar 2022], the 7-day moving average of US COVID-19 cases was 27 747, down nearly 18% from a week earlier [12 Mar 2022]. Most of the country is considered to be in low COVID transmission, according to new CDC guidelines introduced last month [February 2022] that emphasized hospital capacity over case counts. And most people were advised they no longer need to wear masks indoors.

'No evidence for a wave' in wastewater
--------------------------------------
The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, which updated its closely watched projection on Monday [21 Mar 2022], does not expect a big surge of coronavirus cases [in the US] in the coming weeks. "However, it is possible that the rapid return to pre COVID-19 behavior and the spread of BA2 could see a short period of increasing case numbers," tweeted Ali Mokdad, professor at the University of Washington.

Testing of wastewater samples for the coronavirus has proven to be an effective early gauge of coming increases in COVID-19 cases, sometimes spotting new infection surges days or even weeks ahead of human testing data. Biobot Analytics has been testing sewage around the United States for the virus since March 2020, and currently is monitoring over 200 sites in about 40 states. "As of right now, there's no evidence for a wave in the wastewater data," Biobot Analytics chief executive Mariana Matus said. "Just to give a sense of context, the level of the virus in the wastewater was rising about 100-fold faster during the 1st omicron wave in December [2021] as compared to now," Matus said.

New York City is moving ahead with dropping more mitigation plans. Mayor Eric Adams said on Tuesday [22 Mar 2022] that masks will now be optional for children ages 2 to 4 in schools and daycare facilities starting on [4 Apr 2022]. Children below age 5 are not yet eligible for COVID vaccination. The 7-day positivity rate in New York City's schools was 0.15% last week, according to the city's Department of Education. The city's 7-day positivity rate for all ages was 21% at the height of the last surge. "Our schools have been among the safest places for our children since the beginning of the pandemic," Adams said in a statement, "and we will only remove this requirement if the science says that it is safe to do so."
