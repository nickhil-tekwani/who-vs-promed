A young research associate killed by a highly virulent strain of meningococcal disease is believed to have contracted the bacteria from the San Francisco lab where he was working on a vaccine against it, public health officials said on Thursday.

US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention experts are seeking to confirm what they already suspect: that the researcher, 25, died Saturday in an unusual case of a scientist being fatally infected with an agent from his own laboratory. Tom Skinner, a CDC spokesman in Atlanta, said it would test a biopsy sample from the researcher and a sample of the laboratory pathogen he was working with to create fingerprints for each. "If the fingerprints match, you know it's highly likely he acquired the infection from working in the lab," he said. "Someone getting sick and dying from the organism they're working with in the lab is exceedingly rare," he added.

Meanwhile, dozens of people, including relatives, close friends, medical personnel who treated the researcher and some of his co-workers at the research department of the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center were being given antibiotics as a precaution.

Harry Lampiris, chief of infectious disease at the San Francisco VA, said it is likely the researcher died as a result of his work with _Neisseria meningitidis_, a strain of bacteria that causes meningococcal disease, which leads to meningitis and bloodstream infections. "It's our responsibility to assume it's laboratory-associated until proven otherwise," he said.

Since the 1960s, vaccines have been available for some strains of meningococcal disease. But scientists in the San Francisco lab have spent more than 20 years trying unsuccessfully to develop a vaccine against serogroup B, the strain that killed the researcher. "It's been like the Holy Grail to develop the vaccine against [serogroup] B," Lampiris said.

The researcher died of multiple organ failure caused by meningococcal infection and septic shock, said Eileen Shields, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Department of Public Health. He died less than a day after becoming ill. The disease can come on quickly with symptoms including high fever, headache, stiff neck, vomiting, rash, confusion and fatigue.

Lampiris said coworkers described the researcher, who began work at the lab in October, as "a very talented, hard-working and fastidious individual. He was a very bright person who was probably at the beginning of a long research career," he said.

Meningitis, an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, commonly strikes infants and college students living in dormitories, Lampiris said. He said the researcher had not had contact with either group.

About 1000 Americans each year suffer from meningococcal disease, and an estimated 10 to 15% die from it, Skinner said. He could not say how many of the cases resulted from serogroup B.

The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health is investigating the circumstances of the researcher's death, along with its federal counterpart and the CDC, the city Public Health Department and the San Francisco VA.

(http://infectious-diseases.jwatch.org/cgi/content/full/2002/322/1):

"_Neisseria meningitides_ causes bacterial meningitis and sepsis. Diagnosis is usually made by culturing the organisms on standard microbiologic media. Disease is most often acquired by inhalation, and microbiology personnel may be exposed when processing lab isolates. Following the deaths of 2 microbiologists in 2000 from meningococcal disease after occupational exposure, the CDC posted an Internet request for reports of similar cases of occupationally acquired meningococcal disease [see Laboratory-acquired meningococcal disease - United States, 2000. CDC MMWR 2002 Feb 22; 51(7): 141-4; available at
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5107a1.htm &
Sejvar JJ, et al: Assessing the risk of laboratory-acquired meningococcal disease. J Clin Microbiol 2005; 43(9): 4811-4; available at http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/reprint/43/9/4811.pdf].

"A total of 16 cases were reported; 8 were from the USA. 9 (56 percent) were caused by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup B and 7 (44 percent) by serogroup C. 8 patients (50 percent) died. Patients were exposed by reading plates (50 percent), making subcultures (50 percent), and performing serogroup identification (38 percent). All patients worked in microbiology labs. The risk for infection among microbiologists is estimated to be 7 times that among the general population (95 percent confidence interval, 1-19).

"Comment: Although meningococcal disease is uncommon, microbiologists working with _N. meningitidis_ should take special care, because their infection risk is elevated, and the case-fatality rate is high. Most risk is likely associated with exposure to pure cultures rather than to patient samples. Precautions should include using a biosafety hood when manipulating isolates and wearing splash-guards and masks. When such protections are not available, isolates should be referred to other labs for serotyping. Vaccination of personnel may also be considered, but current meningococcal vaccines do not protect against disease from _N. meningitidis_ type B and thus will not eliminate risk for infection.

There are five common meningococcal serogroups: A, B, C, W135, and Y, and a sixth type (X) has recently emerged in Africa. Capsular polysaccharide or protein conjugate vaccines can immunize against disease caused by serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y. Serogroup B remains a major cause of severe invasive disease in infants and adolescents worldwide; but, because the serogroup B polysaccharide resembles the human neural cell adhesion molecule, the serogroup B capsular polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic. The MeNZB™ vaccine previously used in New Zealand was developed to protect against a particular strain of meningococcal B disease in New Zealand. However, the MeNZB™ vaccine only protected against this specific B strain, and did not protect against meningococcal A, C, Y or W135 or the many other strains of B.

A new protein-based, 4 component meningococcal serogroup B (4CMenB) vaccine includes the New Zealand outbreak strain’s outer membrane vesicle plus three semiconserved surface-protein antigens: factor-H binding protein variant 1(fHbp1), neisserial heparin binding antigen (NHBA), and neisserial adhesin A (NadA) is under study (Gossger N, Snape MD, Yu L-M, et al. Immunogenicity and tolerability of recombinant serogroup B meningococcal vaccine administered with or without routine infant vaccinations according to different immunization schedules: a randomized controlled trial. JAMA 2012;307(6):573–582; and Santolaya ME, O'Ryan ML, Valenzuela MT, et al.

Lancet 2012;379(9816): 617–624). It is hoped it will be a broad-spectrum B vaccine (Cohn AC, Messonnier ME. Inching Toward a Serogroup B Meningococcal Vaccine for Infants. JAMA 2012;307(6):614-615.; and, Stephens DS. Comment. Prevention of serogroup B meningococcal disease. Lancet 2012;379(9816):592–594).
