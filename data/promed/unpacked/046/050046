A chicken used to track the presence of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE)
has tested positive for the deadly mosquito-borne disease, the fifth
confirmation of the virus in Chesapeake this year.
Tests also confirmed Wednesday another horse has died of EEE in Suffolk --
the second confirmation of the disease there.
Chesapeake Health Director Nancy M. Welch said tests [what type of tests?
came back positive Thursday on a chicken kept in a cage outside the Western
Branch Mosquito Commission office on Taylor Road.
Efforts to kill mosquito larvae citywide, however, have reduced numbers of
those mosquitoes - known as "bridge vectors" locally - that can transmit
the disease to humans, Welch said.
"It's just confirming again we have the virus in the community," Welch
said. "As long as we keep the bridge vectors down, we keep down the risk to
humans. And that's our goal."
Mosquito-control officials have placed 5 cages of chickens throughout the
city. The disease can be fatal to humans and horses but not to all birds.
Mosquito workers periodically monitor the blood in the chickens.
The tests on the chicken were conducted in a State Health Department lab in
Norfolk, and the bird was taken from the Western Branch office a week to 10
days ago, Welch said.
In addition to the chicken, 3 horses have died from EEE. The horses were
found in the Wild Horse Ridge area in southern Chesapeake; on West Road,
near Number Ten Lane -- within the Deep Creek mosquito-control borough; and
on Shillelagh Road near the Shillelagh Farms community within the Great
Bridge mosquito-control borough. Also, a pool of mosquitoes in the Jolliff
Woods section of Western Branch tested positive last week for EEE [virus.
Welch said the predominant species of mosquito found amplifies the EEE
[virus within birds, but quantities of the mosquitoes that bite humans are
at a very low level. That indicates that mosquito-control workers need to
continue aggressively attacking the larvae, Welch said. Welch urged people
to continue to eliminate standing water and to take necessary precautions
to protect themselves from mosquitoes.
Tissue samples from yet another Suffolk horse were sent Monday to the
National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, Elaine
Lidholm, communications director for the Virginia Department of Agriculture
and Consumer Services, said Thursday.
Tests also confirmed a horse from Prince George County, south of
Petersburg, died of EEE. This makes a total of 8 tissue samples from
Hampton Roads horses and one from outside the area having been submitted to
NVSL for testing. Five have been confirmed to have died of EEE. Two others
had brain lesions consistent with the virus but no isolation confirmation.
One is thought to have died of a brain hemorrhage, and one is just starting
the diagnostic process.
In horses, symptoms include staggering, circling, depression, loss of
appetite and sometimes fever and blindness. There is no cure for the
disease, but it can be prevented with vaccination in horses. There is no
vaccine for humans.
Veterinarians recommend vaccinating horses in southeastern Virginia at
6-month intervals.
