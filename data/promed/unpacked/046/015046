Conjunctivitis has been affecting the internally displaced persons
(IDPs) and other citizens across Sindh, especially in Karachi.
Sources said the IDPs were at a higher risk of being infected with
viral eye infections due to various reasons, especially personal
hygiene, which has yet to be addressed with the provision of toilette goods.

In the past 40 days, the number of IDPs affected with different types
of eye infections, including epidemic conjunctivitis, has reached 11
877, of whom 421 people had reported at 57 medical relief camps
across the city on Tue 21 Sep 2010 alone.

City District Government Karachi Health Executive District Officer Dr
Javed Nasir said viral eye infections have a self-limiting time
course of 5-15 days.

The use of contaminated water is one of the reasons for the spread of
eye infection, he added. Although anti-bacterial chlorine tablets
were added to the water, they need 2 hours to make the water
bacteria-free, he said. Generally, the IDPs do not follow
instructions and start using water before it is free from bacteria
[and viruses], he added.

Sindh Health Minister Dr Sagheer Ahmed had ordered establishment of
11 special eye camps at the city's major hospitals, which have so far
examined 5030 people. 35 patients have been referred to other
hospitals for further treatment, he added.

[Conjunctivitis is an inflammation or infection of the thin layer
(conjunctiva) that lines the inside of the eyelid and covers the
white part of the eye. Inflammation can cause blood vessels in the
eye to become larger. And that can make the white of the eye look
pink or red. Conjunctivitis is a common health condition worldwide.
The 3 most common types of conjunctivitis are viral, bacterial, and
allergic. Currently, outbreaks are occurring throughout the world
(see ProMED-mail references below), and not surprisingly, the extent
of the outbreak in disaster-struck Pakistan far exceeds that observed
elsewhere. A viral etiology is presumed in most of these outbreaks,
but in no case has this been confirmed unequivocally. In view of the
ubiquity of conjunctivitis, in future, outbreaks will be reported
only where the etiologic agent or agents have been identified.
