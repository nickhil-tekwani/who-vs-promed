[The bulletin of the Ministry of Agriculture (in Arabic and French) is available at https://cutt.ly/OCIHyrk. According to the announcement of the Ministry of Agriculture on 8 Sep 2022, the cases are distributed in 5 outbreaks located in the following governorates: Triz Zemmour, Hodh El Gharbi, Hodh El Chargui, Tagant and Trarza. Information on affected species is not included.

In August 2022, a fatal human case was confirmed by the Mauritanian Ministry of Heath. The following is extracted from WHO Africa weekly bulletin (29 Aug-4 Sep 2022): "A new confirmed case of Rift Valley fever (RVF) was reported by the Mauritanian Ministry of Health on 29 Aug 2022. The case is a 25-year-old male breeder from the Moughataa (district) of Tintane in Hodh El Gharbi region. He presented to a health facility with high fever and headache. On 26 Aug 2022, he developed a haemorrhagic syndrome (epistaxis) with severe thrombocytopenia. He died on 29 Aug 2022" (https://cutt.ly/QCICr0G).

On 31 Aug 2022, an outbreak in a camel herd in Hodh el Gharbi governorate was notified to WOAH (see https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8705328). - Mod.SF

The mentioned WOAH report of 31 Aug 2022, "Follow-up report no 1", includes the following epidemiological information:

"Outbreak location: Bouderguel, AÃ¯oun, OD EL GHARBI
Started: 17 Aug 2022
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Camelidae / 119 / 41 / 21 / 0 / 0 / 0"

It was a follow-up report of an RVF event that had started on 25 Sep 2021, reported to WOAH, as an "Immediate Notification", on 26 Oct 2021, addressing sheep flocks in 4 villages in Tintane, Hodh el Gharbi (see 20211027.8699284). In view of the current information, reporting the spread of the virus into 3 additional governorates (Triz Zemmour, Tagant and Trarza), an updated follow-up report is anticipated. It will be interesting to note if other susceptible species, in particular sheep and goats, have been affected. - Mod.AS
