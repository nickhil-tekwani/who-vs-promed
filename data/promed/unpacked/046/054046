The Department of Health is currently conducting four epidemiological
studies to ascertain the mode of transmission of the H5N1 influenza virus in
this outbreak.
The US CDC is conducting genetic sequencing of the virus and also working at
full speed on the development of a test for blood samples taken.
The WHO will distribute H5N1 virus testing kits to all of its Collaborating
Centres around the world shortly for surveillance purposes.
Of the seven cases analysed so far by the Hong Kong Government Virus Unit,
all tested positive. Six had been confirmed by the CDC while the remaining
one was classified as "suspected" pending CDC's independent confirmation.
Two of these cases indicated exposure to poultry within the incubation
period, but the histories of the remaining five cases were less clear.
"Over 550 interviews were conducted and 2,550 laboratory specimens were
taken during the course of investigations." Test results on the blood
samples which could shed more light on the form of transmission could not be
confirmed pending development and refinement of test by CDC.
Follow-up on patient contacts showed all those with flu like illness had
recovered. Results of throat swabs taken from contacts in the first few
cases were all negative while results for the last three cases were pending.
So far, two patients have fully recovered, one is under treatment and is in
satisfactory condition, two are under treatment and in critical condition,
and two have died.
In the meantime, two more cases have been classified as "suspected" by the
Department of Health, bringing the total number of influenza A H5N1 cases in
humans to nine.

In addition to extending the surveillance centres to all General Out-patient
Clinics, the Department of Health will enlist private doctors to participate
in sentinel surveillance.
Laboratory capacity to handle influenza virus has been increased to 2,000
samples per month.
Publicity on how to prevent influenza has been stepped up. TV and radio
announcements will be broadcast from tomorrow. This will be supplemented by
hotlines for enquiry (2833 0112) and education (2833 0111), and publicity
leaflets on the avian flu.
The Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD) will monitor the tightened
control of poultry exported from the mainland to Hong Kong, and check
imported chicken for H5N1 at the Man Kam To border entry point.
AFD will continue surveying local chickens for H5N1 and investigate diseases
and unusual deaths reported in wholesale and retail markets. AFD will
improve environmental hygiene at wholesale markets and work on a prohibition
order to prevent the importation of live chickens other than those derived
from farms certified free from the disease by the Veterinary Officer of the
exporting country.
The Urban Services Department and Regional Services Department will issue
guidelines to all operators of food premises, fresh provision shops, and
market stalls for handling poultry. They will also improve environmental
hygiene at public markets and fresh provision shops, establish reporting
channels to the AFD on sudden poultry deaths and abnormal numbers of poultry
showing symptoms of infection, and monitor the health situation of birds
kept by the two departments.
The Education Department and Social Welfare Department will issue
information to schools and child care centres drawing their attention to
preventive measures.
