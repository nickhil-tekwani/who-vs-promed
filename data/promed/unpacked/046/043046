A frog-killing fungus is responsible for the decline of more species than any other pathogen on record, a global analysis has found. The study, published on 28 Mar [2019] in Science, reveals that chytrid fungi have caused the decline of at least 501 amphibian species worldwide from 1965 to 2015, including 90 that have become extinct.

Other well-known pathogens such as the bat disease white-nose syndrome or West Nile virus, which kills birds, have affected just a fraction of the number of species. Chytrid fungi's impact on biodiversity is comparable to those of the most destructive invasive species, such as cats and rodents, says the study.

Seeing the global effects of the fungus summed up is striking, says Stephen Price, a disease ecologist at University College London. "It's almost a bit Hollywood," he says. "We love these movies about pathogens that emerge suddenly and wipe out humanity, and we've really seen something like that with respect to frogs in the real world."

Chytrid fungi normally live in soil and water, where they break down dead organic material. But in 1998, scientists identified the species _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_, which causes a deadly disease called chytridiomycosis in amphibians. The fungus attacks the skin of toads, frogs, and related animals, preventing them from properly regulating their salt and water levels; this eventually causes the animals' hearts to stop.

Researchers realized that this fungus was responsible for mysterious declines in amphibian populations in South America, Central America, and Australia, where it had been introduced in the 2nd half of the 20th century through the wildlife trade. But no one had added up the effects of the fungus on a global scale. So Benjamin Scheele, a population ecologist at the Australian National University in Canberra, put together a team of 41 ecologists and other experts from around the world to assess the extent of the problem.

Each researcher gathered evidence on which amphibian species had been affected by chytrid fungus in their region, by scouring the scientific literature and unpublished data, as well as interviewing other specialists.

The team found that the fungus was probably involved in the declines of at least 501 amphibian species between 1965 and 2015. These ranged from relatively small losses of less than 20% of a population to complete extinctions. _Atelopus_, or stubfoot toads, were particularly badly affected, with 30 species in that genus presumed extinct.

The number of species experiencing declines peaked in the 1980s, coinciding with the spread of the fungus through Central America and Australia. A smaller peak in the 2000s seems to be related to the spread of the fungus in South America. But no species has been affected in Asia, where the fungus originated. The researchers suggest that amphibians that evolved alongside the fungus developed ways to deal with infection.

Only a few species in Europe have experienced declines, the study found. It's possible that the chytrid fungus reached those regions earlier in the 20th century, says Scheele: the areas saw mass declines in amphibians in the 1950s and 1960s. These have been attributed to the intensification of farming, but the fungus could also have been involved.

Scheele says the threat to species from pathogens -- and the wildlife trade that spreads them -- is underappreciated. "We need to really think much more thoroughly about biosecurity," he says. And he hopes that his data can help. The team found that the species that experienced the worst declines have certain characteristics in common: they tend to have a small range and live in particularly wet regions, for example. Knowledge of these risk factors could direct attempts to protect other species.

Price sees a ray of hope in the otherwise gloomy data. The researchers found that 20% of the surviving species for which data are available are showing small signs of recovery, suggesting that other species might also bounce back.

This work provides a global perspective of the massive impact disease may have on wildlife populations. _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_ (Bd), and its relative _B. salamandrivorans_, appear to have originated in Asia, propagating worldwide after having been taken out by wildlife trade. Out of Asia it found suitable hosts, in some of which the infection was highly virulent and caused the frogs to die.

Virulence is one of the consequences of the host-pathogen (parasite) interaction, and is the cost paid by the host as a result of an infection. Virulence is not simply an attribute of the pathogen, but an outcome of this interaction determined by the interplay between infection and host defenses: it depends on the detrimental effect per parasite (resulting from the agent pathogenicity and from the host tolerance) and by the intensity of parasitism (affected by host resistance, and dependent on parasite exposure). Thus, virulence may vary across a group of hosts, mainly due to variability in defense competences.

Taking the above into account, it is expected that hosts of a given region have evolved defense strategies (tolerance and resistance) to maximize their fitness when infected with local pathogens. Introduction of foreign pathogens in areas where there are susceptible hosts with naive immune systems may cause disastrous results.

It is important to consider that, to attribute causation of a die-off/decline/extinction, there is need of enough supporting evidence. Bd may be present in a crashing population, but evidence indicates that in some cases it is not sufficient cause of the decline. Amphibians have also declined in areas where the fungus is absent, and the fungus is sometimes present for long periods of time without causing disease. Prevalences to various pathogens (other than chytrid fungus) were found to be greater in declining amphibian populations than in non-declining ones (an indication that pathogens in general are affecting amphibian populations). It has been shown that global warming can degrade toads' condition and that frog declines caused by the chytrid fungus were preceded by periods of increasing stress (an indication that poor condition is implicated in population declines). Further, independent studies showed that the severity of the disease is greater in stressed and less vigorous individuals.

Thus, a complementary hypothesis worth considering at the time of implementing conservation actions is that impoverished condition resulting from global environmental change (anthropogenic stressors) may be increasing the virulence of infections by making frogs less competent to fight the chytrid fungus and other pathogens. - Mod.PMB
