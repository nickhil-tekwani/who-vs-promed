The sudden and unexplained deaths of 16 cattle so far this year [2013] in 6 communities of Sacapulas [municipality], Quiche [department] are cause for alarm among residents of the area, who are seeking support from the authorities to establish the cause.

Public Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food (MAGA) authorities reported that, of the 16 cases, only one has been confirmed as bovine rabies and that another disease, known as blackleg, could be the cause of death of the livestock.

Gregorio Velasquez, epidemiologist of the Health Area of Santa Cruz del Quiche, reported that the deaths have occurred in the communities El Jocote, El Matazano, Llano Grande, Salquil I, Salquil II, and Santa Elena.

"We find it strange that only one sample from El Jocote sent to the national laboratory tested positive for bovine rabies. Moreover, the sudden deaths of more animals in other communities are surprising, because they do not show the classic signs of rabies, which makes us think it could be blackleg, a disease that is just as lethal," said Velasquez.

The preliminary field study carried out in areas where cases have been reported, revealed that the cattle in El Matazano, Llano Grande, and El Jocote were drooling, had red eyes, showed aggressiveness, and staggered when walking, all characteristic of bovine rabies. However, other animals showed signs of blackleg disease, including rigidity, inability to rise, and dropping of the jaw.

Aroldo Diaz, MAGA veterinarian in Quiche, indicated that they have vaccinated about 500 cows in the communities of El Jocote, El Matazano, and Llano Grande, where it is presumed that the cause of death is bovine rabies [Did they vaccinate against rabies, or against blackleg? It is not clear, but presumably, they vaccinated against rabies. - Mod.TG].

"In Salquil I and II, the disease can be blackleg, but we can't ascertain it because the samples sent to the national laboratory could not be analyzed. The experts have asked us to send them a brain, but its extraction poses a serious health risk unless all the appropriate preventive measures are taken," said Diaz [If the laboratory is requesting a brain sample, then they may be thinking rabies, as blackleg is not necessarily diagnosed via brain. Therefore, why not send the whole head, and let the laboratory extract the brain, as the lab likely has appropriate equipment and safety already in place. - Mod.TG].

He added that they have also been unable to identify the transmitter of rabies, which could be dogs, cats, vampire bats, or other wildlife.

"In the case of the animals thought to have died from blackleg, we ask that the municipality of Sacapulas contribute funds to buy the vaccine, as we don't have it or the resources to purchase it," said Diaz.

Jorge Flores, coordinator of the Department of Zoonoses of the Health Area, reported that they have received unconfirmed reports of people butchering infected animals that are dying or already dead, and although no international organization has determined that consumption of infected meat can cause illness in humans, eating it poses a health risk.

"We are proposing that the possibility of banning the sale of meat or the slaughter of animals in risk areas be considered, in addition to taking samples of the brains in butcher shops in the municipality to detect whether tainted meat is still being sold," said Flores.

Juan Jose Tiu, mayor of Sacapulas, said the [municipal] council is willing to provide financial support to buy the trivalent vaccine against blackleg and added that a census of cattle, pigs, goats, and horses will be carried out to determine the amount of vaccine to be acquired.

[Blackleg is an acute, febrile disease of cattle and sheep caused by _Clostridium chauvoei (feseri)_, characterized by emphysematous swelling, usually in the heavy muscles. It is found worldwide.

Usually, onset is sudden, and a few cattle may be found dead without premonitory signs. Acute lameness and marked depression are common. Initially, there is a fever, but, by the time clinical signs are obvious, body temperature may be normal or subnormal. Characteristic edematous and crepitant swellings develop in the hip, shoulder, chest, back, neck, or elsewhere. At 1st, the swelling is small, hot, and painful. As the disease rapidly progresses, the swelling enlarges; there is crepitation on palpation, and the skin becomes cold and insensitive as the blood supply to the area diminishes. General signs include prostration and tremors. Death occurs in 12-48 hours. In some cattle, the lesions are restricted to the myocardium and the diaphragm, with no reliable antemortem evidence of the localized lesion.

A rapidly fatal, febrile disease in well-nourished young cattle, particularly of the beef breeds, with crepitant swellings of the heavy muscles suggests blackleg. The affected muscle is dark red to black and dry and spongy; it has a sweetish odor and is infiltrated with small bubbles but with little edema. The lesions may be in any muscle, even in the tongue or diaphragm. In sheep, because the lesions of the spontaneously occurring type are often small and deep, they may be overlooked. Occasionally, the tissue changes caused by _C. septicum_, _C. novyi_, _C. sordellii_, and _C. perfringens_ may resemble those of blackleg. At times, both _C. septicum_ and _C. chauvoei_ may be isolated from blackleg lesions, particularly when the carcass is examined greater than 24 hours after death, which allows time for postmortem invasion of the tissues by _C. septicum_. Field diagnoses are confirmed by laboratory demonstration of _C. chauvoei_ in affected muscle. The samples of muscle should be taken as soon after death as possible. The fluorescent antibody test for _C. chauvoei_ is rapid and reliable.

A bacterin containing _C. chauvoei_ and _C. septicum_ is safe and reliable for both cattle and sheep. Calves should be vaccinated twice, 2 weeks apart, at 2-6 months of age; in high-risk areas, revaccination may be necessary at one year and every 5 year thereafter. When outbreaks are encountered, all susceptible cattle should be vaccinated and treated prophylactically with penicillin to prevent new cases, which may develop for up to 10 days, at which the bacterin provides protection. In some areas, multicomponent clostridial vaccines are warranted. Treatment of clinical cases with parenteral and multiple local injections of penicillin may be attempted but is frequently unsuccessful.

These initial clinical signs may render the animal stiff and cause the animal to not move normally. The jaw dropping does not sound characteristic of blackleg. Perhaps the veterinarians need to expand their differential list. They did not mention crepitant swellings of the heavy muscles, which are somewhat characteristic of blackleg. Rabies does not always cause animals to be aggressive. This presentation may well be rabies, and, with it involving multiple communities, it could be vampire bat rabies and may be paralytic rabies.

Paralytic rabies is 1st manifested by paralysis of the throat and masseter muscles, often with profuse salivation and inability to swallow. Dropping of the lower jaw is common in dogs. Owners frequently examine the mouths of dogs and livestock searching for a foreign body, or administer medication with their bare hands, thereby exposing themselves to rabies. These animals may not be vicious and rarely attempt to bite. The paralysis progresses rapidly to all parts of the body, and coma and death follow in a few hours.

Cattle with furious rabies can be dangerous, attacking and pursuing humans and other animals. Lactation ceases abruptly in dairy cattle. The usual placid expression is replaced by one of alertness. The eyes and ears follow sounds and movement. A common clinical sign is a characteristic abnormal bellowing, which may continue intermittently until shortly before death.
