Situation update
----------------
Between [4 and 10 Sep 2020], EU Member States reported 14 human cases of WNV [West Nile virus] infection, all by Greece. All cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons. This week, 3 deaths were reported by Greece. No human cases of WNV infection or deaths were reported from EU neighbouring countries.

On [3 Sep 2020], German public health authorities reported the 1st human autochthonous WNV infections in Germany during this transmission season. On [10 Sep 2020], further human WNV infections were reported. In total 9 were reported from Leipzig (7), Meissen (1), and Berlin (1). Further suspected cases are being investigated. Virus circulation in birds has been documented since July 2020 in Germany, in a similar area as 2019. As none of the human WNV infections and outbreaks among birds in 2020 have been reported through TESSy [The European Surveillance System] and ADNS [Animal Disease Notification System], respectively, so far, they are currently not represented on the maps and in the Surveillance Atlas.

Since the start of the 2020 transmission season and as of [10 Sep 2020], EU Member States have reported 173 human cases of WNV infection and 15 deaths through TESSy: Greece (91, including 12 deaths), Spain (49, including 3 deaths), Italy (29) and Romania (4). All cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons. No cases have been reported from EU-neighbouring countries.

Since the beginning of the 2020 transmission season, 60 outbreaks among equids have been reported. These outbreaks have been reported by Spain (51, including 29 in the province of Seville), Italy (6), France (1), Portugal (1), and Germany (1) through ADNS. No outbreaks among birds have been reported through ADNS.

The death toll from an outbreak in southern Spain of West Nile virus, which is spread by mosquitos, has risen to 4, local health authorities said Monday [14 Sep 2020].

An 87-year-old woman who was hospitalised with the disease in the town of Puerto Real in the southwestern province of Cadiz is the latest fatal victim of the outbreak, the health department of the regional government of Andalusia said in a statement.

Another 3 elderly people have died from the disease in the neighbouring province of Seville where the outbreak began earlier this year [2020] in the towns of Coria del Rio and La Puebla del Rio, both located next to the Guadalquivir marshes.

Another 10 people are in hospital with the disease in the 2 provinces, including 4 who are in intensive care units, the statement added.

West Nile virus can cause symptoms similar to those of the flu, but in extreme cases, it can result in tremors, fever, comas, and a lethal swelling of the brain tissue known as encephalitis. It can also cause meningitis.

First discovered in Uganda in 1937, the virus is carried by birds and spread to humans by mosquitoes. It is indigenous to Africa, Asia, Europe, and Australia.

The regional government of Andalusia has sprayed several wetland areas with pesticides to kill mosquitos and lower the risk of West Nile virus transmission and has urged people to install mosquito nets and screens in their homes.

The outbreak comes as Spain battles one of the severest COVID-19 epidemics in Europe with nearly 30 000 deaths.

[This is the 3rd update on the WNV outbreak in Spain. The earlier 2 reports were published on 16 and 23 Aug 2020 (West Nile virus (07): Europe, ECDC update, Spain: 20200816.7665472 & West Nile virus (09): Europe, ECDC update, Spain 20200823.7707119). The virus was also reported in horses last month (August 2020) West Nile virus (10): Europe (Spain) horse 20200825.7715087.

The ECDC report in [1] above describes a total of 49 confirmed cases in Spain and 4 deaths in the Andalusia region. The 4 fatalities so far recorded in Spain were all among elderly people -- 3 men aged 70, 77, and 78, and an 85-year-old woman (https://www.thelocal.es/20200911/west-nile-virus-what-you-need-to-know-about). There is no specific profile of at-risk people, as in COVID-19, in which older people with underlying health conditions are at a greater risk of suffering serious symptoms or fatalities.

In 2016, a WNV outbreak was reported in this region with 3 human cases. It was controlled through a well-coordinated public health response with the establishment of measures under the Epidemiology Andalusian Surveillance System (SVEA) WNV protocols (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5894251/).

Since WNV outbreaks in animals precede human cases, the establishment of an active animal health surveillance system to detect new cases in birds and horses is essential in providing early warning for veterinary and human public health authorities. Vaccines have been developed for horses.

Early detection and description of human cases in areas where virus circulation has been previously identified are essential for establishing prevention and control measures. A multidisciplinary approach involving trained and well-informed physicians, veterinarians, and other allied professionals is necessary. It is also fundamental to identify the affected territory in order to adopt the appropriate control measures. This allows early detection of cases and prompt escalation of appropriate control measures that are implemented at the beginning of the vector season. In the absence of a vaccine, the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus. - Mod.UBA
