The World Health Organization (WHO) has pledged to donate 20 million doses of vaccines annually, to aid the eradication of yellow fever in the country.

This is following the commencement of the 2nd phase of vaccination against the disease in 4 states, Kogi, Kwara, Zamfara, and Borno. The campaign is targeting people between 9 months to 45 years of age.

About 10.4 million people were vaccinated in the 1st phase of the exercise, which covered 20 states and the Federal Capital Territory.

Speaking at a press conference in Abuja, on [Tue 23 Jan 2018], WHO representative, Fiona Braka, said every effort must be geared towards containing the outbreak.

"The global body is ready to assist the country in achieving the total vaccination of the populace in line with the Elimination of Yellow fever Epidemics (EYE) by 2026.

"The global community is committed to this course and has pledged 20 million doses available annually to achieve the target despite the global vaccine shortfall," she said.

Until the recent outbreak, Nigeria had received a clean bill of health from WHO which certified Nigeria as a "yellow fever endemic free country." However, the recent pocket of outbreaks in Kogi, Kwara, Zamfara, Niger, Kebbi, and Nasarawa may have reversed the trend.

The 1st outbreak was recorded in September 2017.

The Executive Secretary, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Faisal Shuaib, said that the global non availability of vaccines resulted in the plan to phase the campaign for the next 9 years.

He said that all the states will be vaccinated in phases and a tentative plan to that effect has been approved by development partners.

He said about one million doses have been planned for utilisation in Borno during the campaign which has been slated for 4-5 Feb 2018.

[The yellow fever (YF) vaccination campaign is progressing rapidly, with over 10 million individuals vaccinated in the 1st phase and a 4-state effort scheduled for the 2nd phase. This extensive a vaccination campaign is a not easy in a country as large and populous as Nigeria. Intensified surveillance and response with vaccination campaigns is necessary going into 2018, but given the distribution of cases in so many states, it will be a logistical challenge for state and national health agencies. One hopes that these 2 early phases are sufficient to contain the outbreak. - Mod.TY
