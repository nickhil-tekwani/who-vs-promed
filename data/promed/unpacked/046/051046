Five people in Melbourne have been diagnosed with legionnaire's disease,
two of them from the same city office building, health authorities said
today. Victoria's Chief Health Officer Dr Graham Rouch said the other
three patients may also be linked to the same area of Melbourne's
Exhibition Street.
With the latest outbreak, Dr Rouch urged city dwellers, office workers and
visitors to be alert to the signs of the disease. He said that two with
the disease - among three being treated in hospital - worked at 222
Exhibition Street. One was employed by the Transport Accident Commission
and the other by the Victorian Workcover Authority.
Staff and other tenants in the building have been given information about
the disease. Dr Rouch said the early stages of legionnaire's disease was
characterised by flu-like symptoms, including headache, fever, muscle aches
and respiratory problems.
The most usual method of transmission of the infection was via spray drift
from air conditioning towers. He said Human Services Department officials
took samples from cooling towers at 222 Exhibition Street and were awaiting
confirmation of the results.
He said the towers had been disinfected as a precaution. Dr Rouch said the
recent hot weather in Melbourne had put a considerable extra load on
cooling systems, 'which may have provided a better environment for
_Legionella_ to multiply'.
