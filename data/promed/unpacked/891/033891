A person diagnosed with eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] earlier this season has died, and a 2nd case of the disease has been confirmed in Connecticut this season.

The Department of Public Health confirmed an adult from East Lyme who was hospitalized with eastern equine encephalitis in late August [2019] has died.

DPH also confirmed a 2nd human case has been confirmed in an adult resident of Old Lyme.

EEE is a rare disease, but 30 percent of people who catch it die, and survivors typically suffer ongoing neurological problems, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This marks the 3rd human case of EEE ever reported in Connecticut, according to DPH. The 1st case was in fall 2013.

Symptoms of EEE include headache, high fever, chills and vomiting. It may then progress with disorientation, seizures and coma. There is no specific treatment for EEE.

The disease has been found in mosquitos in 12 towns, including Chester, Haddam, Hampton, Groton, Killingworth, Ledyard, Madison, North Stonington, Plainfield, Shelton, Stonington, and Voluntown. Horses have tested positive for EEE in Colchester, Columbia, Salen, Sterling and Voluntown.

[The map shows the towns having human and equine cases; they are in the southeastern and south-central part of the state.]

West Nile virus is more common than EEE and has been detected in the state every year since 1999. West Nile has been detected in mosquitoes in 23 towns in Connecticut, including Bridgeport, Chester, Darien, East Haven, Greenwich, Groton, Hartford, Manchester, Middlefield, Monroe, New Canaan, New Haven, Newington, North Haven, North Stonington, Norwalk, South Windsor, Stamford, Stonington, Voluntown, West Hartford, West Haven, Wethersfield. A horse in Easton has also tested positive for the virus.

DPH has urged residents to avoid outdoor activities from dusk to dawn, when mosquitoes are most active, and take measures to avoid mosquito bites. State officials said the mosquitoes that carry the viruses are active until the 1st heavy frost.

There have been 10 human cases of EEE in neighboring Massachusetts and 3 in Rhode Island, health officials said.

[Although likely declining, active EEE virus transmission in the northeastern states continues with the risk of additional human cases, like this one, as well as more equine cases. As mentioned in the earlier post, although historically, EEE human cases in Connecticut have been very rare, the occurrence of human cases in the state this year (2019) is not surprising. There have been equine and/or human EEE cases this summer (2019) in the 3 bordering states: Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New York.

A 2nd person in Massachusetts has died from EEE. The patient was a man in his 70's and was the 10th confirmed case of EEE in the state.

The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, and health officials are warning people to take steps to avoid being bitten. These would include using bug-spray [repellant], keeping skin covered, and staying indoors once the sun starts to go down and at dawn. That's when mosquitoes are most active.

[In other states] 3 people in Michigan and one in Rhode Island have also died from the virus.

[A 13 Sep 2019 report from Massachusetts public health officials reported that laboratory testing has confirmed the state's 8 human cases of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] this season (see Eastern equine encephalitis - North America (21): USA (MA) human 20190916.6675862). The above report and one from the USA CDC indicate that there are now 2 more human cases with 10 in Massachusetts (https://www.cdc.gov/easternequineencephalitis/tech/epi.html). Presumably, the fatal case above is one of the 10 infected individuals. Interestingly, 8 equine cases of EEE have also been reported in Massachusetts. Avoidance of mosquitoes is prudent, since there is no vaccine for humans available. - Mod.TY

As had been speculated earlier this week, health officials have confirmed a case of eastern equine encephalitis in Calhoun County.

The Michigan Department of Health and Human services says this is the state's 8th human case of 2019.

The Battle Creek Enquirer reported on Thursday [19 Sep 2019] that a local family was 99.9 percent certain that their father has contracted the disease. the 79-year-old male has fallen into a coma after being hospitalized 3 weeks ago.

Calhoun County joins Barry, Berrien, Cass, Kalamazoo and Van Buren counties in the confirmation of human cases.

So far this year, 3 people in Kalamazoo, Van Buren and Cass counties have died from the mosquito-borne illness.

There have been 3 confirmed horse cases of the disease in St. Joseph County, and all 3 animals died. Recent animal cases of EEE have been identified in Calhoun, Jackson and Montcalm Counties.

Residents are advised to take measures to protect themselves from mosquitoes.

[The number of human EEE cases in Michigan have increased by one from 7 reported on 17 Sep 2019 to 8 reported above (see Eastern equine encephalitis - North America (22): USA (CT, MI, RI) human 20190918.6680282). There is a concern about the 5 individuals who have survived their EEE virus infections. Among the survivors, there is a significant risk of permanent neurological damage following clinical encephalitis. CDC reports that many individuals with clinical encephalitis "are left with disabling and progressive mental and physical sequelae, which can range from minimal brain dysfunction to severe intellectual impairment, personality disorders, seizures, paralysis, and cranial nerve dysfunction. Many patients with severe sequelae die within a few years," (https://www.cdc.gov/easternequineencephalitis/tech/symptoms.html). - Mod.TY
