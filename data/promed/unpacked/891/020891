[1] Obituary: Gustavo Kouri, 1936-2011
Date: Sat 7 May 2011
From: Jaime Torres <torresjaime@cantv.net> [in Spanish, trans.
Mod.TY, edited]


The Cuban physician and scientist Gustavo Kouri, one of the most
outstanding dengue experts in Cuba and internationally, who, for
decades, directed the prestigious Instituto de Medicina Tropical
"Pedro Kouri", named in honor of his father, also a prestigious
physician, died at age 75 years in Havana yesterday [6 May 2011].

"He leaves a permanent footprint of his dedication, mastery of the
transmission of knowledge, [and] experience, to generations of
professionals and his valuable contributions to science," as expressed
in a note in the official newspaper Granma.

Dr Kouri is the author of more than 200 scientific publications and 2
books. At the time of his death, he was a 2nd grade specialist in
microbiology, doctor in biological and medical sciences, full
professor, consultant and emeritus. Also, he was vice president of the
Cuban Academy of Sciences and member of other recognized international
institutions. He held the commemorative plaque of the Pan American
Health Organization and the Order of Carlos J Finlay.

All of us who had the privilege of knowing Gustavo Kouri and shared
some professional activities with him, recognize his considerable
human qualities and his profound Latin American vision, his high
service calling, and his defense of science as an instrument for the
benefit of the people. We express our most sincere solidarity and
sentiments of condolences to his wife and inseparable companion and to
the rest of his family. This is a great loss to science in Latin
America.

- Saudi Arabia (Jeddah). 1 May 2011. "The behavior of comfort" by
mosquitoes is the cause of 64 new cases of dengue fever during the
last week in Jeddah, according to Fahd Adakksi, assistant
under-secretary-Jeddah for crises and emergencies, who explained that
"the behavior of comfort" causes mosquitoes wishing to escape from the
heat, which has begun to increase in Jeddah, to enter into the homes
of citizens, which increases the proportion of mosquito bites of the
population. He said in a press statement yesterday [30 Apr 2011] that
the cases recorded last week [64], compared with 123 cases recorded in
the same week last year [2010], was a decline of 50 per cent. [It is
likely that the _Aedes aegypti_ dengue virus vector mosquitoes were
already in and immediately around homes, where they are most likely to
breed. The heat may be accelerating larval and pupal development, or
cause residents to store more water in their homes, providing more
breeding habitat. - Mod.TY]

- USA (Hawaii). 4 May 2011. The 1st cases of locally contracted
dengue fever in 10 years appear to be limited to 5 Pearl City
residents and did not become a major outbreak. The state Department of
Health has ended its investigation of a possible dengue fever outbreak
after 65 of the 83 reports of suspected dengue cases received from
physicians since 24 Mar [2011] were ruled out or found to be negative,
Environmental Health deputy director Gary Gill said yesterday [4 May
2011]. The department did not have results of the remaining 18 cases.
The Health Department had known of 4 probable cases of dengue fever
since March [2011] and recently found a 5th case believed to be the
person who 1st brought the mosquitoborne disease to Pearl City. That
5th person, a Pearl City resident, had traveled to Asia, became
infected there, then returned home, where the disease [virus] spread
by mosquitoes to the other 4 Pearl City residents, the department
said.
