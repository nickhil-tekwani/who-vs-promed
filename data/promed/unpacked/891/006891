Fresh tests on pigs from Indonesia's Sumatra island, where 6 members of a
[human] family have been confirmed infected with bird flu, did not show any
trace of the H5N1 virus, a senior government official said on Friday [19
May 2006].
Pigs are being tested in the village because they can act as mixing vessels
in which human and bird flu viruses can swap genes, leading to a strain
that can easily infect people and pass from person to person.
"Swab tests from the pigs' nose by the Bogor animal research centre came up
negative for the virus ... the H5N1 virus," Syamsul Bahri, animal health
director at the agriculture ministry, told Reuters. Bogor is in West Java.
Bahri said similar swab tests on poultry from the same village were
negative for the H5N1 virus, but more tests would be done to confirm the
findings. "We will take the samples to the World Organisation of Animal
Health's (OIE) laboratory in Australia for further testing," he said.
Earlier tests by scientists at a leading Indonesian animal research
institute had found pigs in the village where the cluster case occurred
were positive for bird flu antibodies.It indicated the animals had once
been exposed to the H5N1 bird flu virus, but were not infected any longer.
