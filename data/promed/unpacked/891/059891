City based doctors and virologists suspect that the nature of larval mites, a kind of insect [that] causes diseases like scrub typhus, might have changed, as a result of which they are now found within the city. Earlier, the insects were only found in forest areas.

Two persons from Ultadanga's Basanti Colony area reportedly died of scrub typhus in November [2018], triggering panic among other residents of the area. The disease is spread among people through the bites of infected chiggers (larval mites).

Scrub typhus, also known as bush typhus, is a disease caused by bacteria called _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, and it commonly occurs in rural areas. The most common symptoms of scrub typhus include fever, headache, body aches and sometimes rash. Most cases of scrub typhus have so far been reported in rural areas of Southeast Asia, Indonesia, China, Japan, India and Northern Australia. Anyone living in or traveling to areas where scrub typhus is found, could get infected.

Meanwhile, it may be mentioned here that the health workers of KMC [Kolkata Municipal Corporation] on Sunday [25 Nov 2018] morning conducted an awareness campaign at the Basanti Colony area, stating what precautionary measures can be taken in this regard. Deputy Mayor designate Atin Ghosh, who is in charge of the Health department of KMC, said that medicines are available at all the health units run by the civic body. No new cases of scrub typhus have been found.

Virologists in the city, however, believe that the bacteria can be found in urban areas if there is a change in its nature. Due to rapid deforestation in various parts of the country, the bacteria might have been appearing in the city. In the past 10-15 years, they were not commonly found in the city and its adjoining areas.

[A] 26-year-old died earlier this month [November 2018], while [another person] died on 18 Nov [2018]. Both of them had been suffering from fever and other flu-like symptoms for a few days before finally succumbing to their ailments. The Health department officials of KMC suspect that the victims might have died due to the attack of the scrub typhus bacteria. Basanti Colony falls under Ward 32 of KMC. The civic officials and senior officials of the Beliaghat ID Hospital collected samples of blood from some other patients who were down with fever and similar symptoms.

A senior virologist of the School of Tropical Medicine in Kolkata said that the symptoms of scrub typhus usually begin within 10 days of being bitten. Signs and symptoms may include fever, headache, body aches, muscle pain and a dark, scab-like patch. Lymph nodes become enlarged, and rashes appear on the body. The disease can be treated with antibiotics, which are effective if given soon after symptoms appear. People who are treated early with antibiotics usually recover quickly. No vaccine is available to prevent scrub typhus.

[ProMED-mail previously reported on scrub typhus in several Indian states, including West Bengal, where the city of Kolkata is located.

Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials.

Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/12/03-0212_article). Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation.

How the diagnosis of scrub typhus was made in these patients is not stated. Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and eschar at the site of the chigger bite; confirmation requires laboratory testing, usually by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but this will require a 4-fold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent specimens. Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region. The Weil-Felix test, an agglutination test for the diagnosis of rickettsial disease, is based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. The Weil-Felix test is unreliable, but continues to be used in resource-poor regions (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf). Molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are likely not available in endemic regions.

Kolkata, formerly called Calcutta, with a population of 4.5 million residents in 2011, is the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal, located within the lower Ganges Delta on the east bank of the Hooghly River approximately 75 km (47 mile) west of the border with Bangladesh (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata). Kolkata can be found on a map of West Bengal at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kolkata,+West+Bengal,+India.

Basanti Colony is a slum in Ultadanga, a newly developed neighborhood on the northeast fringe of Kolkata district (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultadanga). - Mod.ML
