Circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses - Horn of Africa - 17 May 2018
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In Somalia, a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) has been confirmed, following isolation of this virus from 4 environmental samples collected between [8-22 Mar 2018] from 2 environmental sites in Waberi district, Banadir province (Mogadishu). The detection of cVDPV3 is in addition to the earlier detection of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in the Horn of Africa; the virus was isolated from environmental samples collected from Mogadishu, Somalia and Nairobi, Kenya (reported in the DON on [9 Mar 2018]).

As of 8 May 2018, there has been no isolation of either cVDPV3 or cVDPV2 from acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases or their contacts in either Somalia or Kenya.

Public health response
----------------------
Outbreak response activities for both strains of poliovirus are currently being implemented, in line with internationally-agreed guidelines. In Somalia, 3 large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions; additional SIAs are planned other affected areas in the Horn of Africa in May [2018]. Intensified surveillance activities are being undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.

WHO and partners are continuing to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

WHO risk assessment
------------------
The detection of these cVDPVs underscore the importance of maintaining high levels of population immunity until global polio eradication is achieved and all oral vaccines are withdrawn from use. Such events also demonstrate the risk of cVDPV development in areas or regions with insecurity; limitations on vaccination activities can lead to challenges with maintaining high population immunity. WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and support the implementation of prevention and response measures in collaboration with national governments and partners.

WHO advice
----------
It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP in order to rapidly detect any polio case, and implement prevention and response measures. Member states should maintain high levels of immunity to poliovirus in their populations through effective immunization programmes. Particular attention should be paid to areas and populations affected by insecurity which limits immunization activities.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.

Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to the International Health Regulations Temporary Recommendations that request Member States to report a case of polio as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travellers. Any country that exports poliovirus should ensure vaccination of all international travellers before departure.

[3] Post eradication stocks of poliovirus type 2
Date: Fri 25 May 2018

https://www.statnews.com/2018/05/25/polio-endgame-samples/



For more than 2 years, the global initiative to eradicate polio has been trying to convince companies and laboratories around the world to get rid of stored samples of an extinct poliovirus, with little success.

30 countries have indicated they plan to hold on to type 2 polioviruses, in a total of 99 facilities. That, health officials warn, could endanger years of efforts to stop the virus from crippling children.

"I think it's more than what was anticipated," said Dr David Heymann, an infectious diseases expert who formerly ran the polio program at the World Health Organization and who currently chairs a committee established to help resolve the containment impasse.

Experts say it's unclear why so many countries need to retain an extinct virus -- and in so many locations. But they're hoping the vote on a resolution at the World Health Assembly -- the annual meeting of the member countries of the World Health Organization -- will help changes at least some minds.

The resolution, which will be debated [Fri 25 May 2018] or [Sat 26 May 2018], notes "with alarm" that the containment effort is virtually stalled.

"We were making no progress," Michel Zaffran, the WHO's top polio official, told STAT.

When the polio eradication effort began in 1988, there were 3 types of polioviruses, numbered type 1 through type 3. Type 2 viruses were last seen in 1999 and were declared eradicated in 2015. (Type 3 viruses are probably gone, but the taxing technical process that an eradication declaration requires hasn't yet been undertaken.)

This containment effort is a result of the eradication declaration, and it is a trial run for a larger containment program for all polioviruses, when the other 2 types are declared extinct.

The hope is that time may be coming. To date this year [2018] there have been only 8 cases of paralytic polio diagnosed, in Afghanistan and Pakistan. But Zaffran has warned it's too soon to predict this will be the year polio transmission ceases.

Limiting the number of places that work with or store polioviruses is a critical part of the polio endgame - the plan for how to keep the world safe from polio during the final stages of the eradication process and during the period after polioviruses cease circulating.

The fear is that if this dance isn't executed correctly, polio could accidentally escape from a laboratory or be released from a vaccine manufacturing plant. That type of reintroduced virus would place the work of decades -- work that has cost billions of dollars -- in jeopardy.

These fears aren't simply theoretical. Last year [2017], 2 employees of a polio vaccine production facility in the Netherlands were accidentally exposed to the virus; one of them was infected. In 2014, a vaccine plant in Belgium mistakenly dumped 45 liters of concentrated polioviruses into the local sewage system, which connects to the Lasne River.

Back when smallpox -- which to date is the only virus causing human disease to have been wiped out - was still being battled, the plan was that eventually all samples of the virus would be destroyed. But that hasn't happened; the United States and Russia each maintain small stores of the virus.

With polio, the plan was that after person-to-person transmission is halted, the number of places that could work with or store the virus would be limited to as few as possible. For instance, as long as the world continues to use polio vaccine, vaccine manufacturers will need stocks of polioviruses to produce them. Likewise research laboratories working to develop safer polio vaccines need viruses to pursue that goal.

There is an added complication here: In addition to the facilities that plan to retain samples of live polioviruses, there are many other laboratories that would have stored biological samples -- stool and respiratory tract mucus -- that may contain polioviruses. Polio containment plans refer to them as PIMs -- potentially infectious materials.

Stool collections gathered when polio still circulated, or where the oral polio vaccine is used, could contain live polioviruses or the modified vaccine viruses that are used in the oral vaccine. Working with those stool samples could inadvertently release polio.

The original plan for containment was rigid and dictatorial, Zaffran acknowledged. And when the polio program reached out to other research communities to say samples that might contain polioviruses needed to be destroyed or stored in designated safe facilities, the message was not welcomed.

"The reaction was, 'We don't want to talk about it because it's totally unrealistic. It's much too demanding,"' Zaffran explained.

The polio eradication program didn't have the authority to demand compliance, so a few years ago it adopted a more flexible approach, and it is working on compromise approaches to help reduce the risk posed by stored biological samples.

But there still hasn't been much headway on containment.

"Obviously we think that with a bit more encouragement and discussion, some of these research laboratories will agree that they don't need to handle this virus," Zaffran said. "But at the moment, there is no voluntary movement on the part of these labs. Even if they don't do research at the moment, they hold inventories of samples which they don't necessarily want to destroy or give away."

He hopes the debate over the World Health Assembly resolution will make it clear to countries that holding on to type 2 polioviruses will be costly in terms of the safety measures that will be needed and the certification hurdles they will have to clear.

"But at least it will trigger a discussion on the need to first reduce the number of poliovirus essential facilities ... and make sure that these poliovirus essential facilities get into the scheme of certification of their compliance with containment," Zaffran said.

Heymann helped to write the polio endgame plan when he was at the WHO. He acknowledged the reality of the work involved in containing the viruses exceeds even his expectations.

"The endgame is very, very complex," he noted. "And it's more complex than was ever imaged when eradication was begun."

[The overall good news is the continued absence of identification of polio cases due to WPV1. The most recent date of onset for any case of WPV1 worldwide is 8 Mar 2018 in Pakistan.

The not so good news is the identification of a case of cVDPV2 in Nigeria with date of onset 15 Apr 2018. This follows earlier reports of cVDPV2 isolated from environmental samples in Jigawa state.

Keeping that in mind, the continued isolation of WPV1 in environmental samples in Pakistan is confirmation of circulation of the WPV1 in Pakistan (and in Afghanistan, albeit none were identified in this past week). This also applies to the cVDPV3 in Somalia, and cVDPV2 in both Somalia and Kenya. Continued isolation of these cVDPVs from environmental samples is confirmation of the circulation of these viruses and may well herald the existence of cases of cVDPV2 or cVDPV3.

As for the challenges being posed by the reluctance to destroy WPV2 by laboratories around the world, the experience with smallpox virus and the smallpox eradication effort should be reviewed. Following the declaration of eradication of the smallpox virus, there were 2 cases attributed to a laboratory accident in 1978 in Birmingham, England -- 1 case infected through suspected ventilation system or contamination in the corridor and the other case a contact of the 1st case (see the Report of the Investigation into the cause of the 1978 Birmingham smallpox occurrence available at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228654/0668.pdf.pdf). A compelling "argument" in favor of the need to limit laboratories working with any virus that has had human to human transmission interrupted worldwide -- "Lessons learned".
