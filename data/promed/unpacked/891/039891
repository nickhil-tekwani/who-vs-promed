Summary:
Company announcement date: Thu 19 Mar 2020
FDA publish date: Mon 23 Mar 2020
Product type: animal & veterinary, pet food, foodborne illness
Reason for announcement: potential for _Clostridium botulinum_
Company name: IcelandicPlus LLC
Brand name: Icelandic+
Product description: whole capelin fish pet treats

Company announcement:
Out of an abundance of caution, IcelandicPlus LLC of Ft. Washington, Pennsylvania (PA), is recalling its capelin pet treats because some of the fish have exceeded the FDA compliance guideline for fish larger than 5 inches. The FDA has determined salt-cured, dried, or fermented un-eviscerated fish larger than 5 inches have been linked to outbreaks of botulism poisoning in humans between 1981 and 1987 and again in 1991. Since some IcelandicPlus capelins are larger than 5 inches there is a possible health risk. To date there have been no reported illnesses of dogs, cats, or persons in connection with capelin, nor have there been any positive test results for _Clostridium botulinum_ from any IcelandicPlus capelin. But because of the potential risk, and despite no known illnesses in connection with our products, we have decided, in cooperation with the FDA, to announce this product recall.

_C. botulinum_ toxin can cause severe clinical signs including death in both animals consuming the pet treat and people handling the pet treat or coming in contact with contact areas that have been exposed to the product. Common symptoms may include dizziness, blurred or double vision, trouble with speaking or swallowing, difficulty breathing, muscle weakness, abdominal distension, and constipation. Consider that several of the listed symptoms, such as double vision, cannot be easily assessed in animals or conveyed by an animal. Pets or persons experiencing these symptoms/signs should seek immediate medical attention.

The capelin product was shipped to distributors in the United States with the intent to be sold to retailers who in turn sell to consumers. This product would be found in independent pet specialty stores within all states in the United States.

The product comes in a clear plastic package or tube and is marked Icelandic+ Capelin Whole Fish, Pure Fish Treats for Dogs, or Pure Fish Treats for Cats. UPC codes 8 5485400775 9, 8 5485400711 7, and 8 5485400757 5 are packaged in a 2.5 oz tube or a 1.5 oz or 2.5 oz bag (lot numbers 02/2020 to 02/2022).

IcelandicPlus is family owned and run by pet parents who take the safety and well-being of its consumers and clients with the utmost importance; as such we are conducting this voluntarily recall to further protect our customers. Additionally, we are changing our capelin supplier to ensure that the fish in our product are consistently less than 5 inches, or if larger, they will be completely eviscerated.

Distributors, retailers, and consumers who have purchased IcelandicPlus's capelin can return it to the location where it was purchased for a refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company at 1-857-246-9559 Monday-Friday 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. EST.

[Botulism is a motor paralysis caused by eating food containing the toxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria. This bacterium grows rapidly in decomposing animal tissue and sometimes in plant material. It results in rapid death due to the paralysis of vital organs. Botulism is an intoxication, not an infection.

There are 7 types of _C. botulinum_; the C1 type is most common in animals. The usual source of the toxin is decaying carcasses or spoiled vegetation. Botulism is most common in wild water birds (for example, ducks) and occurs only sporadically in dogs.

The signs of botulism are caused by muscle paralysis and include progressive motor paralysis, disturbed vision, difficulty chewing and swallowing, and progressive weakness. Death is usually due to paralysis of the lungs or heart. Treatment is usually not possible, although a few experimental therapies have had limited success (https://www.merckvetmanual.com/dog-owners/disorders-affecting-multiple-body-systems-of-dogs/botulism-in-dogs). - Mod.TG
