[This comment is in response to the ProMED-mail request for information about the locality where the 2 chikungunya virus infection cases on Lihir Island were acquired. - Mod.TY]

Although we are unaware of the specific travel history of the individuals from Lihir, it is highly likely that these chikungunya infections were acquired locally in Papua New Guinea. Both the Lihir sequences and earlier sequences from patients in Vanimo contain the E1(A226V) mutation found in the original La Reunion and Indian Ocean sequences and group closely with reference strains from Finland 2010 (JQ231211, ex Surabaya, Indonesia) & Thailand 2009 (GU301781).

Since the 1st cases in Vanimo, Sandaun Province in mid-2012, chikungunya has continued its spread throughout PNG, such that a large number of cases have been detected and confirmed by PCR in the province of East New Britain, and in PNG's 2nd-largest city Lae, Morobe Province. Confirmation in several other provinces is currently pending finalization. Information on the progress of the outbreak continues to be made available on a regular basis on the public-domain email listserv PacNet, an information sharing service of the Pacific Public Health Surveillance Network (to subscribe to PacNet, send a blank email to <join-pacnet@lyris.spc.int>).

Without any available recent sequence data from Indonesia indicating the presence of the ECSA genotype in that country, it is difficult to make any connection between the PNG cases and cases in Indonesia.
