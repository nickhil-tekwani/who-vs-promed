Australian tourists in Bali are being told to take extra precautions because of an outbreak of a viral brain infection transmitted through mosquitoes.

Indonesia's Ministry of Health has revealed they're keeping close tabs on the deadly Japanese encephalitis after a spike of cases in Bali and Manado, in North Sulawesi.

The infection [virus] is commonly transmitted to humans through mosquitoes, but birds, bats, cows, and pigs can also carry the disease.

The virus can cause blindness, weakness, movement disorders, and in 30 percent of [clinical] cases, death. [Most infections are mild or asymptomatic. - Mod.TY]

The disease takes up to 15 days to develop with warning signs flu-like symptoms such as a headache, fever, and convulsions.

Ministry of Health Director of Surveillance and Quarantine, Vensya Sitohang, said in Nusa Dua on [Tue 6 Nov 2018] that Bali has had the most cases, followed by Manado, North Sulawesi, according to the ministry's data.

The ministry say they're now introducing a vaccine in Bali in the hopes it will prevent the transmission of the infection to other regions in the country. [Vaccination provides immunity to individuals. Individuals do not spread the virus. - Mod.TY]

Vaccinations are starting from those aged 9 months to 15 years-old as children under the age of 15 are most susceptible to infection.

Aside from the vaccinations, tourists are urged to use insect repellent, wear long sleeve shirts and long pants, to shut windows and use air-conditioning when indoors (when possible), and to pick accommodation that provide screens on windows or mosquito nets around beds.

- Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is the leading cause of brain inflammation in Asia and the western Pacific.
- For most travelers to Asia, the risk for JE is very low but varies based on destination, duration of travel, season, and activities.
- Humans can get virus if bitten by an infected mosquito.
- Most human infections show mild to no symptoms.
- However, a small percentage of infected persons develop inflammation of the brain, with symptoms including headache, high fever, disorientation, coma, tremors, and convulsions.
- 1 in 4 [clinical] cases are fatal as there are no specific treatment for JE.
- Steps to prevent JE include using personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites and vaccination.

[JE infections occur in Bali infrequently. The last ProMED-mail post on JE in Bali was in 2011. It is difficult to assess the current importance of JE in Bali and Manado as no case numbers are given nor the dates that the infections were acquired. Clearly, the Ministry of Health Director of Surveillance and Quarantine believes the situation to be serious enough to initiate a vaccination campaign. The advice about avoiding mosquito bites is prudent and should be followed. - Mod.TY
