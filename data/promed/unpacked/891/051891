Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Equidae / 20 / 2 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: species of horses of different ages and sexes

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae / 10 / 5 / 50 / 5

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Four samples (equine blood and serum) were sent to the Pirbright Institute (United Kingdom) for checking serotype on [31 Mar 2020], and the results were positive for African Horse Sickness (AHS) disease; all 4 samples were diagnosed as serotype 1 of AHS virus. Those samples were sent by a private veterinarian. However, the Department of Livestock Development (DLD, competent authority of veterinary service in Thailand) will send more samples from other outbreak spots to check the serotype in 2 or more OIE reference laboratories for AHS soon. The Department of Livestock Development started vaccination against African horse sickness (polyvalent live attenuated vaccine) on [19 Apr 2020]. Horses within the Horse and Animal Breeding Station, Thai Red Cross Society, Cha-am District, Phetchaburi Province, supplying 560 horses used to produce immunoglobulins to treat rabies and snake venom, were the 1st one to be vaccinated with AHS vaccine in Thailand. The further AHS vaccination started from [20 Apr 2020], which will be conducted for horses at a distance of 50 km [31 mi] from the disease sites in 7 provinces where an outbreak was discovered. The AHS working group conducted a preparatory meeting with targeted regional, provincial, and district livestock offices and related parties before the vaccination. The meeting [focused] on the operation for effective vaccination to [combat] the AHS epidemic as quickly as possible.

Control measures:
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, vaccination in response to the outbreak(s) [560 Equidae were vaccinated in Phetchaburi Province], surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, quarantine, zoning, disinfection, control of vectors, vector surveillance, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), treatment of affected animals (anti-inflammation, antibiotics, antipyretic, and supplement).

Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Institute of Animal Health (national laboratory) / Equidae / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 3 Apr 2020 / positive
National Institute of Animal Health (national laboratory) / Equidae / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 13 Apr 2020 / positive
National Institute of Animal Health (national laboratory) / Equidae / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 15 Apr 2020 / positive
National Institute of Animal Health (national laboratory) / Equidae / reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 7 Apr 2020 / positive
National Institute of Animal Health (national laboratory) / Equidae / serotype / 15 Apr 2020 / positive
The Pirbright Institute (OIE reference laboratory) / Equidae / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 4 Apr 2020 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Thailand reported its 1st outbreak of African horse sickness (AHS) on 27 Mar 2020. To date [24 Apr 2020], 7 outbreaks have been reported. See event summary and map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=33768.

Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Equine / 1606 / 231 / 211 / 0 / 0
(see https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000034060_20200424_154447.pdf)

After the immediate notification of this outbreak of AHS occurring in Pak Chong, Nakhon Ratchasima district, was submitted by the delegate of Thailand, the OIE suspended the "AHS free country" status of Thailand. The free status was suspended effective 27 Mar 2020 (see https://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/african-horse-sickness/suspensionreinstatement-of-status/).

AHS poses a significant challenge to the equine industry and veterinary services at both national and regional levels. The OIE provides science-based standards, guidelines, and recommendations for the prevention and control, diagnosis of infection, and production of high-quality AHS vaccines.

Detailed information summarizing relevant information on the activities that the Asia and Pacific region has been working on as well as OIE recommendations on AHS are available at https://rr-asia.oie.int/en/projects/african-horse-sickness/.

The OIE has organized a series of webinars, to be held 10 Apr to 5 May 2020, on this disease. The webinar series cover several different topics related to AHS. To participate in the webinar, see information at https://rr-asia.oie.int/en/events/oie-webinar-on-the-african-horse-sickness/.

"There is no evidence that humans can become infected with any field strain of AHSV, either through contact with naturally or experimentally infected animals or by virus manipulation in laboratories." Source: OIE Terrestrial Manual, Chapter 3.5.1 African horse sickness (Infection with African horse sickness virus), available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.05.01_AHS.pdf. - Mod.CRD]

[Since the onset of the 1st AHS outbreak in Thailand, reportedly on 24 Feb 2020, the _Culicoides_-borne orbivirus plague spread into 7 of Thailand's provinces, causing, according to a reliable source, 438 clinical cases in horses, of which 394 died. The affected provinces are Nakhon Ratchasima, Chonburi, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Phetchaburi, Chaiyaphum, Ratchaburi, and Sa Kaeo (see map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Thailand).

This is the 1st time that AHS has been reported in South-East Asia and the 1st detection of AHS serotype 1 outside the African continent. Previous outbreaks outside Africa involved serotypes 9 and 4. The decision of the Thai authorities to use a polyvalent vaccine (likely from a manufacturer in South Africa) deserves to be explained. According to OIE Terrestrial Manual, the only commercially available AHS vaccine is live attenuated. To the best of our knowledge, it is available in 2 "combinations," each including several of the 9 known serotypes.

This event is of concern for the potential further spread of the disease within Thailand and to neighbouring countries. China (about 800 km [497 mi] from Thailand's borders "as the _Culicoides_ midges fly," or rather windborne in given meteorological conditions) has published an exhaustive announcement on the news website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, dated 26 Apr 2020. The document informs about the outbreak in Thailand and underlines the risk of AHS introduction as "high."

The notice indicates that "the China Animal Disease Prevention and Control Center and the China Animal Health and Epidemiology Center should pay close attention to collecting, sorting out, and making popular science promotion points for different practitioners for use in various places. All localities should increase the propaganda and popularization of knowledge on prevention and control of AHS by all available extension means and urge employees to do carry-out insecticide actions against the vector insects such as midges in animal breeding places and the cleaning and disinfection of their breeding environment." The notice further requires that the China Animal Health and Epidemiology Center, the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and other units should carry out in-depth research on the etiology of AHS virus, strengthen the rapid diagnosis and other technical research reserves, and strengthen the control of provincial animal disease prevention and control institutions. On top of the above, sampling of equids in border regions have been undertaken. The document (in Chinese) is available at http://www.agri.cn/V20/ZX/sjny/202004/t20200426_7371139.htm. - Mod.AS
