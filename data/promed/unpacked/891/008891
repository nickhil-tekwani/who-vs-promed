The Arizona Game and Fish Department (AGFD) has confirmed a disease event affecting a portion of the bighorn sheep population in the Black Mountains of northwest Arizona.

After receiving reports in early December [2015] from hunters who observed bighorn sheep in Game Management Unit 15D exhibiting coughing or nasal discharge, the department conducted a spot survey of the northern portion of the unit on 9 Dec 2015. Tissue samples from 3 ewes, each animal culled from a different herd, showed characteristics consistent with pneumonia.

The survey then was extended into the central and southern portions of the unit. A few bighorn sheep near Mount Nutt and Battleship were observed coughing, but none of the animals were culled. The survey did not reveal any carcasses. All bighorn sheep observed in the survey appeared to be in good bodily condition. Some animals in Unit 15C also have shown signs of pneumonia.

While bighorn sheep can thrive in some of the harshest environments, they are highly susceptible to serious -- and sometimes lethal -- infectious diseases, such as pneumonia, sinusitis, and bluetongue. Bighorn sheep can contract pneumonia-causing bacteria from domestic sheep or other bighorn sheep, and there is no vaccine or cure.

Weeks of laboratory testing confirmed that the strain of pneumonia bacteria found in the affected bighorn sheep is the same as the one that led to an outbreak of pneumonia that affected bighorn sheep in 2013 in California's Mojave National Preserve and last year [2014] in Nevada's Spring Mountains. While most bighorn sheep will remain in a defined home range, animals may occasionally move out of the core home range and come into contact with adjacent populations. The disease is transmitted by direct contact of infected animals with susceptible bighorn sheep.

The department will continue to monitor the bighorn sheep population in the Black Mountains and track reports of affected animals while attempting to collect samples if any carcasses are discovered in the area.

[In the past, pneumonia affecting bighorn sheep has been considered a multi-factorial disease. However, this article seems to say that there is a definite bacterium and that it is the same bacterium that caused at least 2 other outbreaks in other regions.

Now the question becomes, how did the bacteria get there? Was there interaction with an animal from one of the previous locations? Is this a bacterium found in the region in domestic sheep or in other animals that these bighorns may have come in contact with?

It would be helpful if the AGFD would release the name of the bacterium isolated from the terminated ewes.
