11 individuals from the town of Rila, district of Kyustendil, have tested positive for brucellosis. The regional health inspectorate announced the information for Radio FOCUS - Kyustendil. 3 blood samples initially tested positive for the disease and so did samples from 8 more people later. The infected individuals are aged 36 to 77. They will all undergo treatment.

Measures over the ascertained outbreak of brucellosis continue to be implemented. A meeting is to be held on Thursday evening, 30 Jul 2015, in Rila at which information will be provided about brucellosis transmission and the measures required to tackle the situation.

Brucellosis outbreak among ruminants has been reported and confirmed in the territory of Rila municipality. The news broke at an extraordinary sitting of the district epizootic commission in the municipality, Radio FOCUS reported.

Laboratory tests confirmed the disease among 15 goats from 3 agricultural sites in the town of Rila. All necessary measures have been taken. The animals are kept at the barns and there is a ban on the consumption of milk and dairy products, as well as other animal products.

More restrictive and preventive measures are to be taken.

[The manifestations of brucellosis in the human cases (or if the cases were diagnosed serologically without symptoms) are not stated.

Brucellosis (http://www.emedicinehealth.com/brucellosis/page2_em.htm) is a disease that is thought to have existed since ancient times, as it was 1st described more than 2000 years ago by the Romans and Hippocrates. It was not until 1887 that a British physician, Dr David Bruce, isolated the organism that causes brucellosis from several deceased patients from the island of Malta. This disease has had several names throughout its history, including Mediterranean fever, Malta fever, Crimean fever, Bang's disease, and undulant fever (because of the relapsing nature of the fever associated with the disease).

The signs and symptoms of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may develop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic symptoms.

The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive, and they can be similar to those of many other febrile illnesses, so recognition of potential exposure -- from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, working in a slaughter house or meat processing plant, or working in a microbiology lab -- is vital. - Mod.LL]

[Bulgaria's policy regarding _Brucella melitensis_ in animals prescribes "general and targetted surveillance". The last reported case dates back to 2009.

The human disease situation (number of human cases/year) in the last 5 years, according to OIE data, is the following:
2010 - 0
2011 - 0
2012 - 1
2013 - 1
2014 - 2.
Details on the source of those sporadic human infections will be helpful.

It remains to be hoped that the current outbreak be eradicated the soonest, preventing its spread. Data on the origin of infection will be helpful.

How serious _B. melitensis_ may become once it is established in a territory can be learnt from a recent media report on the _B. melitensis_ deteriorated situation in Israel; see http://www.haaretz.com/life/health-fitness/.premium-1.668581.

Some internationally accumulated lessons and guidelines may be found in refs 1 and 2.
