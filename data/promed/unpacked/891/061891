Viet Nam: Another Avian Influenza Death
---------------------------------------
Avian influenza has killed another man in Viet Nam, taking the number
of deaths in Asia caused by the virus to 62. [As of Fri 5 Aug 2005,
the WHO listed the number of laboratory-confirmed deaths attributable
to avian influenza in East Asia since 26 Dec 2003 as 57, with 40
occurring in Viet Nam. - Mod.CP]
The 35-year-old man died in the Mekong Delta province on 31 Jul 2005,
a day after he was taken to hospital with a high fever, state
newspapers stated on Tue 9 Aug 2005. The Thanh Nien newspaper stated
that the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City had confirmed that the
man had slaughtered and eaten 2 chickens infected with the H5N1 avian
influenza virus. The man's death took the avian influenza death toll
in Viet Nam to 43, with 22 of the victims dying since the virus,
which first swept through much of Asia in late 2003, returned in
December 2004. [As of Fri 5 Aug 2005, the WHO figures for
laboratory-confirmed deaths caused by H5N1 virus infection as 40
overall, and 20 since December 2004. - Mod.CP]
The H5N1 avian influenza virus has also killed at least 12 people in
Thailand, 4 in Cambodia, and 3 [only one of the latter confirmed by
WHO - Mod.CP] in Indonesia. [H5N1 avian influenza has been reported]
as far north as Siberia, although there have been no reports of human
infections from there. Health experts say the H5N1 virus is now
endemic in parts of Asia, including Vietnam and Thailand, despite the
deaths or slaughter of tens of millions of domestic fowl. They fear
the longer the virus survives, the more likely it is to mutate into a
form which can pass easily between humans. If that happens, millions
of people without immunity could die.

[The reason for the discrepancies noted above between the WHO figures
and the local counts may be due more to delays in communicating
results, rather than disputes over the accuracy of tests. There is
still no unequivocal evidence of human-to-human transmission of H5N1
virus infection in Viet Nam; nonetheless the continuing occurrence of
cases of human infection increases the likelihood of appearance of a
virus variant capable of person-to-person transmission. - Mod.CP]
