The Maryland health department has found bacteria in 2 bottles of raw milk produced at a farm near Scotland. Meanwhile, the number of people sickened in the Campylobacter outbreak on Thu 2 Feb 2012 grew to 35 in 3 states, 28 confirmed cases in Pennsylvania, 4 in Maryland, and one in New Jersey, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health. The outbreak started on Fri 27 Jan 2012 with the report of 6 cases.

The Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Laboratories Administration has confirmed the presence of _Campylobacter jejuni_ in 2 unopened raw milk samples purchased from The Family Cow farm, according to a department news release issued on Wed 1 Feb 2012. Prior to the announcement from the Maryland health department, farm owner Edwin Shank sent an e-mail to customers. He said the farm family was proceeding as if a pathogen had been found in the milk.

The final test results of samples taken at the farm by the Pennsylvania Department of Health on Friday and Monday [27 and 30 Jan 2012] may be available on 3 Feb 2012, according to Agriculture Department Press Secretary Samantha Krepps.

The health departments advise consumers to discard any of "The Family Cow" raw milk purchased since 1 Jan 2012. The farm voluntarily suspended the sale of milk on 31 Jan 2012, and the product remains unavailable.

[The final testing referred to in the posting likely is the "DNA fingerprinting" of the isolates to confirm that "smoking" milk has been found, that is, the alleged vehicle has the same isolate as the clinical isolates. This latest report now shows the number of cases tied to the dairy to be 35, 4 times the original number reported only a few days ago. - Mod.LL
