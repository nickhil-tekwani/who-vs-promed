Three virus strains have been recently isolated from the urine of fruit
bats (_Pteropus hypomelanus_) found on an island off the east coast of
Peninsular Malaysia. In Vero cells, syncytial cytopathic effect (CPE)
resulting in formation of multinucleated giant cells was seen within 7 days
of inoculation. One of the isolates was further tested and showed similar
CPE in BHK-21, RD, MDCK, PS and Hep-2 cells, and to a lesser extent in
human fibroblast cells (MRC-5).
Virus-infected Vero cells gave positive staining with Menangle-specific
antibody, weaker staining with sera from patients infected with Nipah virus
and minimal staining with anti-Hendra hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid. The
staining characteristically appeared mainly within the cytoplasm of the
syncytial cells.
EM study of virus infected cells showed pleomorphic virus particles ranging
in size from 180 to 300+ nm with viral morphogenesis at the cell membrane.
Collection of viral nucleocapsid could be seen in the cytoplasm, similar to
Nipah virus.
This finding is of interest because of the recent outbreak of Nipah
encephalitis in Malaysia and the possibility that bats may be the natural
reservoir of Nipah virus. The isolates came from a species of bats which
have been found by the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL), Geelong,
to posses antibody to Nipah virus by ELISA.
At this stage, we can only conclude that these bat viruses we have isolated
are members of the family Paramyxoviridae, with antigenic cross-reactivity
to Menangle and Nipah viruses. Further identification is on-going in
collaboration with CDC, Atlanta and AAHL.

[This finding constitutes a huge step forward in understanding the natural
history of these bat paramyxoviruses. It may now be possible to understand
how these viruses infect livestock and to prevent future such occurrences.
If this virus is Menangle virus, it has a wider distribution than simply
one part of Australia, which was the only place known to harbor this virus.
