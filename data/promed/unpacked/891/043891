The Department of Tropical and Emerging Diseases of the San Roque hospital recently reported 5 cases of psittacosis, an infectious and [potentially] highly dangerous disease for humans, transmitted by birds. To prevent a [larger] outbreak, people are urged not to buy birds sold on the street.

The 1st cases recently confirmed were a married couple who were seen at the San Roque hospital and who had contracted the bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_, the cause of psittacosis. Subsequently, 3 additional confirmed cases were reported by private medical practices to the Ministry of Health of the province.

The couple who contracted the disease indicated that the symptoms began within days of buying a monk parakeet at the city bus terminal and parrots were implicated in the infection of the other 3 cases.

In this context, the head of Tropical and Emerging Diseases of San Roque hospital, Gustavo Echenique, confirmed the cases and warned that the illegal trader who sold the bird to this couple had about 20 more birds for sale, which could also spread the disease. The tropical diseases physician reported that all 5 cases were clinically stable, although one woman was pregnant, which modified the treatment in that particular case.

[_Chlamydophila psittaci_ has been isolated from about 100 bird species, but most human _C. psittaci_ infections result from exposure to pet psittacine birds. Transmission has been documented from other birds, however, including doves, pigeons, birds of prey, and shore birds.

Psittacosis, also known as ornithosis or parrot fever, is a human disease caused by the bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. Classically associated with psittacine birds such as parakeets, parrots, and cockatiels, it may affect other avian species such as turkeys, ducks, pigeons, and pheasants. Human infection in general is caused by inhalation of dust containing the bacterium, which is shed in large amounts in the feces and secretions of the infected birds. Illegally imported decorative birds that have not been screened and/or treated can be a significant source of the pathogen.

The respiratory infection, usually diagnosed serologically, can be fatal if untreated. Although most diagnosed cases have direct exposure to birds, the infection may be acquired indirectly through the aerosolization of infective material in the grass or ground such as when mowing a lawn. Because of such outbreaks, protective equipment may be recommended for individuals in areas frequented by free-ranging birds, if contact with birds and their droppings is likely when performing outdoor activities such as lawn mowing.

People who are occupationally exposed to psittacosis include pet store workers, poultry farmers, poultry processing workers, and veterinarians.

Historically (http://animal-health.library4farming.org/Animal-Swine-Rabbits/DISEASES-AND-PARASITES-AFFECTING-poultry/Ornithosis-and-Psittacosis.html), the 1st description of a disease marked by an atypical pneumonia was reported in 1879 among persons having contact with sick parrots. A severe and sometimes fatal atypical pneumonia was observed in various European countries and the USA in later years. An unusually severe epidemic occurred in Paris in 1892. The name psittacosis was suggested for the disease in 1895.

An epidemic involving more than 100 cases of atypical pneumonia, diagnosed as psittacosis, occurred in Argentina in 1929. A year later, outbreaks in Europe and the USA were traced to parrots newly imported from South America. - Mod.LL
