From: Dr Sadegh Chinikar <vahmaz@yahoo.com>

The laboratory of arboviruses and viral haemorrhagic fevers of the
Pasteur Institute of Iran began its activities in October 2000, and we
have constant collaboration with the WHO reference center on
arboviruses and viral haemorrhagic fevers of the Pasteur Institute of
Dakar (Senegal). Since that time we have been doing serological
experiments by specific ELISA methods for the detection of IgM and
IgG against CCHF virus in human and domestic animal sera.
This center is the only National Center for Arboviruses and viral
haemorrhagic fevers in Iran. After receipt of human and domestic
animal sera from different provinces of Iran, serological experiments
are done, and our results are transmitted by the Pasteur Institute of Iran
to the CDC and the veterinary organisation of Iran.
In the near future we are going to do RT-PCR experiments on these
sera. So the report of Mr Ataie from Isfahan [see ref. below] saying
that there are no modern laboratories in Iran to diagnose CCHF is not
true.

receiving reports of results of its tests on cases of emerging infectious
diseases in Iran. - Mod.JW]
