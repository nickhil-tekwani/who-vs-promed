Health Minister Babatunde Osotimehin said Lassa fever had [caused] 12
cases with 5 deaths within 2 weeks. He said: "Much more worrisome is
the danger that the outbreak poses to health workers. Do far, 4
health staff working in the National Hospital, Abuja who were taking
care of one of the Lassa fever cases have also fallen ill and the
laboratory investigations have confirmed they are infected with Lassa
fever [virus].

"Within the last 2 weeks, we have recorded 13 cases with 6 deaths
(CFR of 42 percent). 4 health staff working in the National Hospital,
Abuja, who were taking care of one of the Lassa fever cases have also
fallen ill and laboratory investigations have confirmed they are
infected with the Lassa virus." The minister has therefore directed
that Ribavirin, a specific antiviral drug for Lassa fever, be given
to Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Health Department and health
facilities in FCT and its environs for prompt and adequate treatment
of cases and contacts.

He also advised that people should [avoid] having contact with rats
by putting food in rat-proof containers, keeping their homes clean to
discourage rats from entering, and setting traps in and around homes
to help reduce rat population, among others. "The Federal Ministry of
Health is striving to create awareness and give appropriate
information to prevent the spread of the disease. The ministry
wants the general public and parents in particular to know the
symptoms," he said.

Yesterday [4 Mar 2009], the Senate urged the Federal, State, and Local
Governments to set machinery in motion to check the spread of Lassa
fever. This was consequent upon a motion sponsored by Senator Abubakar
Sodangi (PDP, Nasarawa West) and 10 other senators. Sodangi said Lassa
fever was a dangerous communicable disease.

Deputy Minority Leader, Senator Olorunnimbe Mamora (AC, Lagos East),
who is a medical doctor, said Lassa fever was not caused by eating
rats [large field rats are a tasty morsel in Nigeria. - Mod.JW], but
a virus carried by rats.

[Undoubtedly a serious epidemic of Lassa fever is occurring in the
Federal Capital Territory and adjacent regions, but the precise number
of cases and fatalities is difficult to determine. The figures cited
in the report above differ from those given in the previous report;
see 'Lassa fever - Nigeria (02) 20090225.0788'. The most significant
additional circumstance is the occurrence of nosocomial transmission
in a healthcare setting.
