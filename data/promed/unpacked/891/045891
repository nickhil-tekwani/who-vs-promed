Another person has been confirmed infected in an _E. coli_ O157 outbreak linked to organic yogurt from Pure Eire Dairy in Washington State. Officials with the Washington Department of Health have not released details about the patient, except to say that the person lives in Arizona and is considered a "secondary" case.

Investigations by the Washington health department and the state agricultural department are ongoing. The state health department announced the outbreak on 12 May [2021].

The newly confirmed patient is the 3rd person in Arizona to be declared part of the outbreak. All 3 are considered secondary patients because they did not consume the implicated yogurt. Rather, they were exposed to the bacteria via people from Washington State who were infected and visited Arizona.

As of 24 Jun [2021], there are 17 confirmed patients in the outbreak. Ten of the patients are younger than 10 years old. Ten of the 17 patients have had such severe symptoms they had to be admitted to hospitals. The Washington health department has not released the ages of those who have hospitalized.

Of the 17 outbreak patients, 4 have developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type of kidney failure that can be fatal.

Most of the sick people reported eating organic yogurt made by the Pure Eire Dairy in Othello, WA. Both PCC brand and Pure Eire brand yogurt have been recalled.

[Another secondary case has been reported in Arizona related to contact with someone from Washington State who directly ingested the yogurt -- alternatively, given the timing of the report, perhaps a tertiary case.

It is noteworthy that 4 of the 17 cases developed HUS (23%), which is a high percentage, as it usually occurs in less than 10% of cases. The early use of antimicrobials seems to be a risk factor for the development of HUS, but some strains of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ seem to have a higher risk probably due to the production of higher amounts of Shiga toxin or certain Shiga toxin subtypes.

The posts have not stated that the vehicle was made from unpasteurized milk. - Mod.LL
