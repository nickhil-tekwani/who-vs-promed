The quarantine disease potato ring rot has been detected by the Agriculture and Livestock Service (SAG) in the Araucania region. During their regular annual survey of potatoes to keep areas of Bio Bio and Araucania regions free of quarantine diseases, SAG found potatoes with ring rot symptoms. The disease is present in other areas of the country.

A survey to determine the outline of the affected areas and an investigation as to the source of the tubers used as seed were carried out. Eight potato plots in 3 districts, with a total of about 100 hectares, were found to be affected. SAG emphasises that the outbreak was due to the illegal use of food potatoes as seed tubers. This places the responsibility on the affected producers.

[Ring rot of potato is caused by the bacterium _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_. Yield losses of up to 50 percent have been reported. Many solanaceous species, including tomato and aubergine, are also susceptible, and the pathogen has also been found associated with symptomless infections of sugar beet and sugar beet seed.

Symptoms on potato may include wilting and yellowing of leaves, rot of the vascular ring of tubers with emerging bacterial ooze, and extensive tuber rot followed by internal hollowing, cracking, and mummification. Wilting symptoms may occur late in the season and are often masked by the natural senescence of the crop. Symptom expression depends on host cultivar and is favoured by cool climates. Tubers with ring rot are often subjected to secondary invasion by other bacteria and fungi, which can result in total loss of tubers in the field or in storage.

The pathogen is spread with infected seed tubers or other plant material, plant-to-plant contact, soil, and by mechanical means (for example during harvest or grading). The bacteria can survive for several years on dry surfaces and for over a month in water. They can overwinter in unharvested potatoes or crop debris. Ring rot can pass through one or more crop generations without causing symptoms, and latently infected tubers are an important means of spreading the disease. Laboratory tests are needed to detect latent infections. Disease management is expensive and may include cultural practices and plant hygiene measures before and after harvest, but the use of certified clean seed potatoes is vital. Illegal farm saved seed potatoes, as mentioned in the item above, are known to pose a serious risk for the spread of ring rot.
