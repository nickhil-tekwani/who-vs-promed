Current situation
-----------------
On 23 Apr 2008 the Lima District Health Unit (DIRESA) notified the
General Directorate for Epidemiology of 3 confirmed cases of
cutaneous anthrax from the Caudevilla locality, Supe District.


Description of the cases
------------------------
Case 1: 29-year-old, male worker in the Supe slaughterhouse, who went
to the hospital on 16 Apr 2008, presented with an ulceronecrotic skin
lesion in the right forearm, with perilesional edema, accompanying
fever, and with a Gram-positive smear of the lesion compatible with
_Bacillus anthracis_.

Case 2: 26-year-old female who went to the same institution
[hospital] on 19 Apr 2008 with a ulceronecrotic skin lesion on the
2nd finger of the left hand, and a Gram-positive swab of the lesion
compatible with _B. anthracis_.

On 10 Apr 2008 both patients had participated in a clandestine
butchering of a bovine [animal] in Caudevilla, Supe district. A 3rd
person participated in the butchering, but has not been identified yet.

Case 3: [this person] identified by an active search, [is a]
9-year-old female, with an ulceronecrotic skin lesion on the dorsum
of the right hand and beginning of illness on 21 Apr 2008, and who
participated in washing the viscera of the same animal as in the cases above.

Measures applied
----------------
On 21 Apr 2008, the staff of the Supe Hospital in conjunction with
the SENASA (State Animal Health) veterinarian investigated and:
- located the clandestine slaughter facility where the exposure
occurred and vaccinated the 7 cattle and 11 sheep found there;
- the owner said that the cow had been ill for 3 days before
slaughter and had been bought recently and with unknown vaccinal
status in Huaura province;
- the meat had been distributed in the community and part had gone to
a shop in Supe;
- the 3 patients remain in the Supe hospital and have responded
favorably to free antibiotic treatment.

Measures to be applied
----------------------
- implementation of an epidemiological anthrax alert in the Barranca
area reporting the current situation, clinical characteristics, and
management of anthrax cases.
- investigation and identification of exposed persons who
participated in the clandestine butchering of the animal suspected of
having anthrax
- follow up of contacts for identification and prompt management of cases
- dissemination of preventive measures among the public

Commentary
----------
Barranca is enzootic for anthrax. [Human] cases were registered in
1997 (5), 1998 (6), 1999 (10), 2000 (3), 2001 (5), 2005 (3), and 2006
(4). This outbreak is associated with the clandestine slaughter of a
sick bovine. There is risk of additional cases since the number of
persons exposed to the contaminated meat and hide that were
commercialized is not known.

[Anthrax is found in half the coastal provinces of Peru and the
annual numbers of human cases is in significant 2-digit numbers, such
as, from 22 to 84 annual cases from 2000 to 2006, indicating that the
numbers of livestock cases are meaningfully under-reported,
unfortunately. This is a long persisting livestock problem in Peru.

indicating the location of the outbreak as well as photographs of the
lesions. - Mod.MHJ]

Current situation
-----------------
On 18 Apr 2008 DIRESA Piura notified the General Directorate for
Epidemiology of a probable cutaneous case of anthrax in the city of
Piura, district and province of Piura.

Description of the case
-----------------------
The patient is a 16-year-old male working as a porter transporting
meat from one butcher's shop to another in the city of Piura. The
illness started on 13 Apr 2008. The patient presented with symptoms
of fever, cough, sore throat, conjunctival congestion, cutaneous
lesion on the nape of his neck (see photograph at source URL) not
painful, papular with raised edges, hard with central necrosis. On
auscultation there was evidence of pulmonary congestion in both
lungs. After 2 days of ambulatory treatment with ciprofloxacine and
chloramphenicol, he has responded well.

Measures applied
----------------
- an investigation team has been mobilized to check on possible other
local cases and exposed persons in clandestine slaughter facilities;
- samples taken from the patient have gone for culture and PCR
(polymerase chain reaction) examination;
- an epidemiological alert was issued in Piura and Castilla with
information on the current situation, clinical characteristics, and
management and prevention of anthrax cases.

Measures to be applied
----------------------
- investigation and identification of exposed persons.

Commentary
----------
[DIRESA] Piura 1 registered 36 cases of [human] anthrax between 1981
and 1985 in the Piura districts of Talara and Morropon. This case was
clinically what one expects of cutaneous anthrax along with a
concurrent respiratory infection, probably viral. Although the swab
of the lesion was negative for anthrax because of its low
sensitivity, this test does not discard the disease. The culture and
PCR results are awaited in order to confirm the diagnosis.

[While human cases may have last been seen there in the early 1980s,
livestock cases occurred in 2004 and 2005 in Piura. Any shortcomings
in the translation are mine so anyone interested is encouraged to
read the original reports. Reading between the lines,
clandestine/non-permitted slaughter facilities are patently a
veterinary public health problem as both reports quote them. - Mod.MHJ]
