For a decade, the number of babies born with syphilis in the United States has surged, undeterred. Data released Tuesday [12 Apr 2022] by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show just how dire the outbreak has become.

In 2012, 332 babies were born infected with the disease. In 2021, that number had climbed nearly 7-fold, to at least 2268, according to preliminary estimates. And 166 [7.3%] of those babies died. About 7% of babies diagnosed with syphilis in recent years have died; thousands of others born with the disease have faced problems that include brain and bone malformations, blindness, and organ damage.

For public health officials, the situation is all the more heartbreaking, considering that congenital syphilis rates reached near-historic modern lows from 2000 to 2012 amid ambitious prevention and education efforts. By 2020, following a sharp erosion in funding and attention, the nationwide case rate was more than 7 times that of 2012.

Even as caseloads soar, the CDC budget for sexually transmitted disease prevention -- the primary funding source for most public health departments -- has been largely stagnant for 2 decades, its purchasing power dragged even lower by inflation.

Tuesday's CDC report on STD trends provides official data on congenital syphilis cases for 2020, as well as preliminary case counts for 2021 that are expected to increase. CDC data show that congenital syphilis rates in 2020 continued to climb in already overwhelmed states like Texas, California, and Nevada and that the disease is now present in almost every state in the nation. All but 3 states -- Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont -- reported congenital syphilis cases in 2020.

From 2011 through 2020, congenital syphilis resulted in 633 documented stillbirths and infant deaths, according to the new CDC data.

Preventing congenital syphilis -- the term used when syphilis is transferred to a fetus in utero -- is from a medical standpoint exceedingly simple: If a pregnant woman is diagnosed at least a month before giving birth, just a few shots of penicillin have a near-perfect cure rate for mother and baby. But funding cuts and competing priorities in the nation's fragmented public healthcare system have vastly narrowed access to such services.

The reasons pregnant people with syphilis go undiagnosed or untreated vary geographically, according to data collected by states and analyzed by the CDC. In Western states, the largest share of cases involves women who have received little to no prenatal care and aren't tested for syphilis until they give birth. Many have substance use disorders, primarily related to methamphetamines. "They've felt a lot of judgment and stigma by the medical community," said Dr. Stephanie Pierce, a maternal fetal medicine specialist at the University of Oklahoma who runs a clinic for women with high-risk pregnancies.

In Southern states, a CDC study of 2018 data found that the largest share of congenital syphilis cases was among women who had been tested and diagnosed but hadn't received treatment. That year, among Black moms who gave birth to a baby with syphilis, 37% had not been treated adequately even though they'd received a timely diagnosis. Among white moms, that number was 24%. Long-standing racism in medical care, poverty, transportation issues, poorly funded public health departments, and crowded clinics whose employees are too overworked to follow-up with patients all contribute to the problem, according to infectious disease experts.

Doctors are also noticing a growing number of women who are treated for syphilis but reinfected during pregnancy. Amid rising cases and stagnant resources, some states have focused disease investigations on pregnant women of childbearing age; they can no longer prioritize treating sexual partners who are also infected.

Treating a newborn baby for syphilis isn't trivial. Penicillin carries little risk, but delivering it to a baby often involves a lumbar puncture and other painful procedures. And treatment typically means keeping the baby in the hospital for 10 days, interrupting an important time for family bonding.

McGrath has seen a couple of babies in his career who weren't diagnosed or treated at birth and later came to him with full-blown syphilis complications, including full-body rashes and inflamed livers. It was an awful experience he doesn't want to repeat. The preferred course, he said, is to spare the baby the ordeal and treat parents early in the pregnancy.

But in some places, providers aren't routinely testing for syphilis. Although most states mandate testing at some point during pregnancy, as of last year [2021] just 14 required it for everyone in the 3rd trimester. The CDC recommends 3rd-trimester testing in areas with high rates of syphilis, a growing share of the United States.

After Arizona declared a statewide outbreak in 2018, state health officials wanted to know whether widespread testing in the 3rd trimester could have prevented infections. Looking at 18 months of data, analysts found that nearly three-quarters of the more than 200 pregnant women diagnosed with syphilis in 2017 and the 1st half of 2018 got treatment. That left 57 babies born with syphilis, 9 of whom died. The analysts estimated that one-third of the infections could have been prevented with testing in the 3rd trimester.

Based on the numbers they saw in those 18 months, officials estimated that screening all women on Medicaid in the 3rd trimester would cost the state USD 113 300 annually, and that treating all cases of syphilis that screening would catch could be done for just USD 113. Factoring in the hospitalization costs for infected infants, the officials concluded the additional testing would save the state money.

And yet prevention money has been hard to come by. Taking inflation into account, CDC prevention funding for STDs has fallen 41% since 2003, according to an analysis by the National Coalition of STD Directors. That's even as cases have risen, leaving public health departments saddled with more work and far less money.

Janine Waters, STD program manager for the state of New Mexico, has watched the unraveling. When Waters started her career more than 20 years ago, she and her colleagues followed up on every case of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis reported, not only making sure that people got treatment but also getting in touch with their sexual partners, with the aim of stopping the spread of infection. In a 2019 interview with KHN, she said her team was struggling to keep up with syphilis alone, even as they registered with dread congenital syphilis cases surging in neighboring Texas and Arizona. By 2020, New Mexico had the highest rate of congenital syphilis in the country.

The COVID-19 pandemic drained the remaining resources. Half of health departments across the country discontinued STD fieldwork altogether, diverting their resources to COVID. In California, which for years as struggled with high rates of congenital syphilis, three-quarters of local health departments dispatched more than half of their STD staffers to work on COVID. As the pandemic ebbs -- at least in the short term -- many public health departments are turning their attention back to syphilis and other diseases. And they are doing it with reinforcements. Although the Biden administration's proposed STD prevention budget for 2023 remains flat, the American Rescue Plan Act included USD 200 million to help health departments boost contact tracing and surveillance for COVID and other infectious diseases. Many departments are funneling that money toward STDs.

The money is an infusion that state health officials say will make a difference. But when taking inflation into account, it essentially brings STD prevention funding back to what it was in 2003, said Stephanie Arnold Pang of the National Coalition of STD Directors. And the American Rescue Plan money doesn't cover some aspects of STD prevention, including clinical services.

The coalition wants to revive dedicated STD clinics, where people can drop in for testing and treatment at little to no cost. Advocates say that would fill a void that has plagued treatment efforts since public clinics closed en masse in the wake of the 2008 recession.

Texas, battling its own pervasive outbreak, will use its share of American Rescue Plan money to fill 94 new positions focused on various aspects of STD prevention. Those hires will bolster a range of measures the state put in place before the pandemic, including an updated data system to track infections, review boards in major cities that examine what went wrong for every case of congenital syphilis, and a requirement that providers test for syphilis during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. The suite of interventions seems to be working, but it could be a while before cases go down, said Amy Carter, the state's congenital syphilis coordinator.

"The growth didn't happen overnight," Carter said. "So our prevention efforts aren't going to have a direct impact overnight either."

[The United States has experienced a rising incidence of syphilis since 2000 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats15/syphilis.htm). In 2000, primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis reached historic lows with fewer than 6000 reported cases and an incidence rate of only 2.1 cases per 100 000 people. However, in 2015, 23 872 P&S syphilis cases were reported with an incidence of 7.5 cases per 100 000 population, the highest rate reported since 1994. Syphilis rates increased in every region of the United States, a majority of age-groups, and across almost every race/ethnicity.

During 2000-2015, the rise in the rate of reported P&S syphilis in the United States was primarily attributable to increased cases among men and, specifically, among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). In more recent years (2013-2015), P&S syphilis also increased among women, which was associated with increasing rates of congenital syphilis. During 2014-2015, the rate of reported P&S syphilis increased 18.1% among men and 27.3% among women (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats15/syphilis.htm), and in 2016, the number of congenital syphilis cases was the highest it's been since 1998 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-congenital-syphilis.htm).

Congenital syphilis occurs when a child is exposed in utero to a mother with untreated early syphilis. Up to 40% of babies born to women with untreated early syphilis may be stillborn, or die from the infection as a newborn (https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-congenital-syphilis.htm). Some babies are asymptomatic at birth, but, if untreated, may show developmental delay and damage to their bones, teeth, eyes, ears, and brain either in the 1st few weeks after birth or years later.

All pregnant women should be tested for syphilis at the 1st prenatal visit or at the time that pregnancy is confirmed. Testing should be repeated for pregnant women at high risk and in areas of high prevalence at the beginning of the 3rd trimester and at delivery. The 2021 US CDC guidelines for syphilis screening in pregnancy can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment-guidelines/syphilis-pregnancy.htm:

"All women should be screened serologically for syphilis at the 1st prenatal care visit (174), which is mandated by the majority of states (142 [see CDC URL immediately above for complete references]). Among populations for whom receipt of prenatal care is not optimal, serologic screening and treatment (if serologic test is reactive) should be performed at the time of pregnancy testing (632). Antepartum screening can be performed by manual nontreponemal antibody testing (e.g., RPR [the RPR, or rapid plasma reagin, test, is a blood test for syphilis that detects nontreponemal antibody] by using the traditional syphilis screening algorithm or by treponemal antibody testing (e.g., immunoassays) using the reverse sequence algorithm.

"Pregnant women with positive treponemal screening tests (e.g., EIA, CIA, or immunoblot) should have additional quantitative nontreponemal testing because titers are essential for monitoring treatment response. Serologic testing should also be performed twice during the 3rd trimester: once at 28 weeks' gestation and at delivery for pregnant women who live in communities with high rates of syphilis and for women who have been at risk for syphilis acquisition during pregnancy.

"Maternal risk factors for syphilis during pregnancy include sex with multiple partners, sex in conjunction with drug use or transactional sex, late entry to prenatal care (i.e., 1st visit during the 2nd trimester or later) or no prenatal care, methamphetamine or heroin use, incarceration of the woman or her partner, and unstable housing or homelessness (174,633-636). Moreover, as part of the management of pregnant women who have syphilis, providers should obtain information concerning ongoing risk behaviors and treatment of sex partners to assess the risk for reinfection.

"Any woman who has a fetal death after 20 weeks' gestation should be tested for syphilis. No mother or neonate should leave the hospital without maternal serologic status having been documented at least once during pregnancy. Any woman who at the time of delivery has no prenatal care history or has been at risk for syphilis acquisition during pregnancy (e.g., misuses drugs; has had another STI during pregnancy; or has had multiple sex partners, a new partner, or a partner with an STI) should have the results of a syphilis serologic test documented before discharge."

Poverty and other social factors have a big impact on rates of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases among women. The above news report clearly stress the importance of funding cuts over many years to health departments across the United States on their ability to control diseases like syphilis. - Mod.ML
