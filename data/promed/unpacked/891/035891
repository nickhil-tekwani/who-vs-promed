[The identification of SBV-infected biting midges (culicoides), collected in northern Italy during Sep-Nov 2011, is interesting and, in fact, intriguing. In spite of the virus circulation, only a single animal in a single holding has reportedly been clinically affected in Italy. According to Italy's immediate notification of 20 Feb 2012, on the said farm, located in Sarmede, Treviso, Veneto (map at http://www.maplandia.com/italy/veneto/treviso/sarmede/), a pregnant goat had delivered one healthy small sized kid on 6 Feb 2012 and due to some complications died the day after. At necropsy a dystocic malformed foetus was found, which was SBV positive. It was not possible to perform diagnostic examinations on the dead goat.

Has only one pregnant ruminant been infected during the months Sep-Nov in the said region? Or, could the pregnant animals (cattle, sheep, goats) in the region have been infected prior to their 2011 pregnancy, seroconverting thus not susceptible to SBV infection during pregnancy? Serosurvey -- if and when performed -- will, hopefully, provide some clarification.

The vector issue, and its prevalence in Europe, deserves also further attention. SBV has been earlier demonstrated in Belgium in one pool of _C. obsoletus s.s._ caught on 7 Sep 2011 and one pool of _C. dewulfi_ caught on 4 Oct 2011, as well as in Denmark, in (unspecified) culicoides collected in Oct 2011. No clinical cases have been reported from Denmark, where serology results are also to be expected with interest. - Mod.AS
