A yellow fever vaccination response campaign was officially launched this Thursday [7 Jul 2022] in Laï. It was during a ceremony chaired by the secretary general of the department of Tandjilé Est, Abdelaziz Tchanlan Tokama, representing the prefect.

Following the 25 confirmed cases of yellow fever in the province of Tandjilé, more precisely in the health districts of Laï and Deressia, this vaccination campaign has been launched.

In his speech for the occasion, the interim provincial delegate of Public Health and National Solidarity of Tandjilé, Dr Adjibera Jean Baptiste, indicated that this very effective vaccine is safe to fight against yellow fever in the province of Tandjilé, leaving Chad as a whole free from yellow fever, for at least 10 years [The WHO indicates that the vaccine is effective for life].

Dr. Adjibera Jean Baptiste added that the success of this campaign depends on the mobilization of all sections of the population, so that all the population aged from 9 months to 60 years are vaccinated. Excluded are pregnant women and people over 60 years old.

Officially launching this campaign, the secretary general of the department of Tandjilé Est, Abdelaziz Tchanlan Tokama, declared that vaccinating a child is contributing to sustainable development for the Chad of tomorrow.

To do this, the SG invites the entire population of Tandjilé to be vaccinated and to vaccinate their children against this disease. The expected population covered in this yellow fever vaccination campaign is 144 954.

[This is Chad's 1st yellow fever (YF) outbreak reported by ProMED since 2013. It is possible the YF virus has been circulating in the country undetected since then. The current outbreak is not focal, the 25 confirmed cases having occurred in 2 health districts. There is no indication of the proportion of the populations in these districts that have been vaccinated in the past. One hopes that the vaccination campaign is successful and will prevent further YF virus transmission in the regions. - Mod.TY
