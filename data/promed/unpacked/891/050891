Rana refutes news on deaths by JC [should be JE]
-----------------------------------------------
The news about the deaths by Japanese Encephalitis (JE) as reported
in the different media is not true. Only 40 percent of the total
deaths were from JE, said the Ministry of Health and Population
(MoHP) on Monday [12 Sep 2005].
Assistance Minister for MoHP Nikshya Shumsher Rana said that ministry
attention was drawn to the published news, and cross checks found
that 60 percent of the deaths were due to other reasons, like viral
influenza and other diseases.
According to the Epidemiology and Disease Control Unit (EDCU), only
204 deaths out of the 1249 reported by the 2nd week of September 2005
were due to JE.
Assistance Minister Rana said that the ministry had been taking the
initiative for vaccination since last year [2004], but it has been
lagging behind due to policy-level difficulties. Vaccination was
initiated 5 years ago as a trial but was discontinued after one year
because of difficulties in procedure and tendering. The Minister said
that the government was working to restart the process, and the
proposal is in the cabinet. If the cabinet passes it, 27 000 units of
vaccine will be brought in during the 1st phase. The WHO will also be
providing 20 000 units.
Minister Rana claimed that the death rate from JE is lower in Nepal
than in several other countries due to better services to patients.
In other countries in a epidemic situation, the death rate is as high
as 30 percent, while it is 15 to 20 percent here, he said.
Assistance Minister Rana said that DFID and the World Bank would
provide NPR 14 billion [USD 201 million] for the 275 000 vaccinations
and NPR 5 million [USD 72 000] for secondary medicines. He said that
the ministry has also been sending money directly to the districts.
Director of the EDCU Dr. Mahendra Bahadur Bista said that 5000
vaccinations, which were received as a donation, would be sent to
Dang and Bardiya on Tuesday [13 Sep 2005]. He said that 40 000
insecticide-treated mosquito nets were also provided to 3 districts:
6000 for Kailali, 20 200 for Kanchanpur and 14 000 for Jhapa. Next
year [2006], 11 million nets would be provided to the most affected
districts, he said.
The nets were sold at NPR 100 [USD 1.43] from those who were able to
pay this price and NPR 30 [USD 0.43] from those who were not. The
nets are sold as social marketing, he said. The money collected from
the selling of the nets will be used locally, Dr. Bista said.
Spokesman at the ministry Dr. Hari Nath Acharya said that the
ministry had always remained serious about the people's health. But
the delay in vaccination and the providing of nets was due to
procedural problems, he said.
Primarily, children above 15 years of age are affected by JE. He said
that among the total number of infected cases, 50 percent are
children. There is no specific treatment for JE, only treatment for
the symptoms and supportive care to reduce the risk of death or
disability, as antibiotics are not effective against viruses, and no
effective antiviral medicines have been discovered. While the death
rate for JE is up to 30 percent, about 40 percent of the survivors
suffer from some sort of disability, including paralysis, mental
retardation and recurrent seizures or personality changes.
