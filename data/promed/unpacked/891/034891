News from the Ebola response
ASSORBIKO: Intercession Mass for Ebola Victims in Equateur Province
- The Association of Bikoro Nationals, acronym ASSORBIKO, organized a Mass for the Ebola victims this Saturday, 5 [26?] May 2018, in the conference room of the Free University of Kinshasa.
- On this occasion, the faithful and believers have implored God's mercy for a prompt healing of their brothers and sisters who are currently suffering from the Ebola epidemic in the areas of Mbandaka, Bikoro, Iboko and Itipo. They prayed the good God to welcome in his eternal bliss the dead whom the present epidemic has occasioned.

- The Secretary General of the Ministry of Health, representing the Minister of Health Oly Ilunga, invited ASSORBIKO to encourage their relatives in Equateur to respect the hygiene measures and avoid picking up dead animals to stop the spread of the virus. He also recalled the messages about vaccination, projected in the room by the Director of National Program of Communication and Health Promotion, Raoul Kamanda.
- Finally, the ceremony attended by honorable deputies, senators, the Secretary General of Health, religious persons, and members of ASSORBIKO ended with the reading of messages of thanks and grievances from the ASSORBIKO on the Ebola epidemic in Equateur in Bikoro territory.

Communicated by:
ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[The good news is that there are no new positive cases or deaths, and the suspect case recently identified in the new area of Ntondo is negative.

These reports state that identified contacts "are followed and advised to limit their movements during the entire follow-up period of 21 days." Presumably, this means that contacts are not confined or quarantined within their homes but monitored for the development of fever and other signs that meet the "case on alert" criteria, at which point they should be admitted to an Ebola treatment centre for diagnosis and treatment. "Limiting movements" presumably means discouraging or preventing identified contacts from traveling from their home locale to other villages or cities. - Mod.LXL
