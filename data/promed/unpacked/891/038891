["Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a contagious transboundary disease which has severe negative socioeconomic impacts on the income of livestock farmers and, in particular, the livelihoods and food security of the most vulnerable rural communities, notably of women" http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/ppr-portal/.

"PPR was 1st reported in 1942 in Ivory Coast. Since then, the disease has spread far beyond its origin in Western Africa. In the past 15 years, its dissemination has been exponential and PPR is now present in over 70 countries across Asia, Africa, and the Near and Middle East, having reached Europe in 2016 (Georgia)" http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/ppr-portal/distribution/.

"The OIE and the FAO, in their joint strategy for control and eradication of PPR, have set the goal of eradicating the disease by 2030." Additional information is available at the OIE and FAO Peste des petits ruminants portals at http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/ppr-portal/ and http://www.fao.org/ppr/en/, respectively.

Good surveillance, rapid detection and rapid communication of an outbreak are key components of a successful control and eradication program. OIE member countries are obliged to notify the OIE through its World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS) or by fax or email within 24 hours of detecting a significant epidemiological event.
