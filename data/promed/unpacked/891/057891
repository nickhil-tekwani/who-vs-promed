Abstract
States in south-eastern Brazil were recently affected by the largest Yellow Fever (YF) outbreak seen in a decade in Latin America. Here we provide a quantitative assessment of the risk of travel-related international spread of YF indicating that the United States, Argentina, Uruguay, Spain, Italy and Germany may have received at least one travel-related YF case capable of seeding local transmission. Mitigating the risk of imported YF cases seeding local transmission requires heightened surveillance globally.

[Background]
The south-east of Brazil was recently affected by the largest outbreak of Yellow Fever (YF) reported in a decade in Latin America, with 784 confirmed human cases and 267 confirmed deaths reported as of [31 May 2017]. The outbreak has spread from Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo to São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, thus raising public health concern about the establishment of urban transmission and the spread of YF beyond Brazil's national border.

Discussion
The southern United States, Argentina and Uruguay contain regions where _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitos, the most competent vector species for YF transmission, are established. While _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes are not present in Europe, except on Madeira, _Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes, which are potentially also competent to transmit the YF virus, have been reported in Germany, and established populations have been observed in Spain, Italy and in the south and north-east of the United States. To date, however, there has been no evidence of natural YF transmission by _Ae. albopictus_ in any part of the world. In continental Portugal and Chile, the presence of competent YF vectors has not been documented, although both countries are considered climatically and environmentally suitable. With no new YF cases reported in Brazil since [31 May 2017], the 2017 YF outbreak in Brazil currently appears under control. We estimated that international travel-related YF spread may have occurred during the outbreak, implying that increased awareness, monitoring and preparedness was therefore appropriate to avoid the current YF outbreak in Brazil seeding new YF outbreaks globally.

[Fortunately, there has been no evidence of _Ae. aegypti_ transmission of YF virus in Brazil during this outbreak. All cases have been reported as cases due to sylvan (forest) transmission of the virus. The real risk of dissemination from an ongoing YF outbreak was illustrated by the 11 cases in Chinese workers who acquired their infections in Angola and subsequently traveled to China while ill (see Yellow fever - China (09): ex Angola 20160424.4179477).

Countries with very low YF vaccine coverage such as the southern USA and China and that have populations of _Ae. aegypti_, are at significant risk of a YF outbreak should the virus be introduced by a viremic traveler. Countries with populations of _Ae. albopicturs_ may be at risk as well as the above report indicates. - Mod.TY
