As of 9 Jul 2003, the Ministry of Health, Algeria has reported a total of
10 laboratory-confirmed cases and 1 probable case of Plague in Oran
district (see previous report:
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_07_03b/en/>).
A joint WHO and Ministry of Health team investigated this outbreak, and the
preliminary findings are being used for control measures. Further
investigations will be needed to identify and describe a possible natural
focus (unknown so far in Algeria) as well as to identify the mechanism of
the spread of the causative organism, _Yersinia pestis_, in this area.
