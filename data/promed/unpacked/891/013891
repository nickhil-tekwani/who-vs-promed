The number of dengue fever cases fell by more than a third last month [January 2012] in Thailand after last year's floods interrupted the breeding cycle of the mosquito that carries it, health officials said Friday [3 Feb 2012].

In January [2012], 1056 cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever and one death were reported at public hospitals, down 36.2 percent compared with the same period of 2011, the Communicable Disease Control Department said.

Dengue, which is usually pandemic in Bangkok, is transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which prefers to lay its eggs in clean, standing water commonly found in urban settings.

In October and November [2011], the central plains and parts of Bangkok were hit by the worst floods in 5 decades, but the resulting inundations were fetid and unsuitable for the _A. aegypti_ to breed.

"The floods actually interrupted the [mosquito's] life cycle and has resulted in a reduction in dengue," said Sanphet Mahamard, a dengue expert at the department.
