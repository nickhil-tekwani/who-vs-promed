Four cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, a young man in intensive care
--------------------------------------------------------------------
After a 5th death due to chikungunya (a 78-year-old man whose health was extremely precarious) was reported last Friday [5 Dec 2014] in the health watch newsletter, the hospital of Taaone [Tahiti, French Polynesia] has now announced 4 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome that could be attributed to the virus. A 34-year-old man is currently in intensive care, while the other 3 are under observation in the neurology department. However, health officials are reassuring. The chikungunya virus outbreak is decreasing in Tahiti and Guillain-Barre syndrome is in the normal range for the time being.

Guillain-Barre syndrome
-----------------------
Guillain-Barre syndrome is a severe inflammatory neurological disorder that attacks the peripheral nerves and causes paralysis. This syndrome often occurs a few weeks after a viral infection, even a benign one. Usually, when the body is attacked by viruses or bacteria, lymphocytes are responsible for attacking the aggressors. But sometimes, in very rare cases, the action of these lymphocytes is misdirected after a viral infection or the immune system can over-react. The body's immune system begins to attack itself. The patient develops symptoms of muscle weakness, and difficulty swallowing and breathing. Muscle weakness can turn into quadriplegia. Guillain-Barre syndrome is characterized by tingling, prickling and muscle weakness, and ascending paralysis. It starts from the feet then rises gradually; in most serious cases, it can cause respiratory paralysis with the need for respiratory support in patients.

In the 1st quarter of the year (2014), the Zika virus outbreak caused 42 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome in French Polynesia.

[French Polynesia has been undergoing a concomitant outbreak of both chikungunya and Zika viruses. ProMED-mail has previously reported the 42 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) that occurred during the Zika virus outbreak [see archive no. 20141016.2870853). The 4 cases of GBS reported above following chikungunya virus infections is a new observation. Interestingly, no cases of GBS have been attributed to chikungunya virus infections in the explosive outbreak of that virus in the Americas. Clinicians need to be aware of the appearance of GBS in patients who have suffered infections by either virus.

A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of the islands in French Polynesia can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3027992,382. - Mod.TY]

[GBS has been previously described as a rare sequela of chikungunya infection in other locations. For example, GBS was described in 2 patients with evidence of chikungunya infection on the French island of Reunion in 2006:
