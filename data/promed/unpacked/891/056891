Ebola is currently the single greatest threat to the survival of gorillas and chimpanzees, having wiped out 1/3 of their populations since the 1990s.

The virus is even more deadly to great apes than it is for humans, with mortality rates as high as 95 percent for gorillas and 77 percent for chimpanzees. That compares to around 50 percent for humans. Ebola has been responsible for several catastrophe great ape population declines.

The outbreaks are infrequent, but when they strike they can wipe out huge swathes of the animals, especially if the carcasses are left uncollected.

In 1995, an outbreak killed off 90 percent of gorillas in a national park in Gabon. In 2002-2003 another outbreak killed 5000 gorillas in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

With an estimated 100 000 gorillas left in the wild, that's a major blow.

Africa's great apes are also under attack from poaching, habitat destruction, war, and other infectious diseases.

The lack of habitat means that infected animals are more likely to come into contact with each other, and therefore more likely to contract the virus; it's a vicious cycle.

As a consequence both eastern gorillas and western gorillas have been listed as endangered since 2008.

The spread of the deadly virus could be curbed by vaccinating the animals -- a safe and effective vaccine for gorillas and apes has already been developed -- unlike for humans.

However, the trials of the vaccines haven't yet involved testing vaccinated chimps with the live virus.

"Across much of Europe, medical research on great apes is either banned or highly restricted because of their cognitive similarity to humans. The question is whether or not we should make an exception in this case," says expert Meera Inglis.

Vaccinating the great apes could also help humans, since contact with infected animals has been found to cause secondary epidemics in humans.

Wild populations of gorillas and chimpanzees are threatened by a diverse array of virulent pathogens, including Ebola virus. Ebolaviruses have caused massive die-offs of gorillas and chimpanzees. Over the last 2 decades the Zaire strain of Ebola has killed roughly 1/3 of the world's gorilla population and only a slightly smaller proportion of the world's chimpanzees (see http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029030).

Wild great apes can serve as sentinels of infectious diseases. Using the information that can be provided by feces is an excellent non-invasive tool to monitor their health.

Vaccinating wildlife is very challenging. It can be extremely costly, dangerous, and little feasible. It has to be evaluated whether achieving the coverage of a relevant proportion of the population is realistic. The vaccine has to be efficient and also safe for the apes. Notwithstanding, given the conservation crisis Ebola is causing, it is worth giving vaccination a careful consideration. - Mod.PMB]
