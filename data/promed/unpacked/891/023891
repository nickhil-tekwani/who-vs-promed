Unusual disease affects valley sheep
----------------------------------------
In the sagebrush desert near the intersection of Lincoln, Minidoka
and Blaine counties [in Idaho], grazing sheep don't pay much
attention to county lines. So officials at the Idaho State Department
of Agriculture aren't sure exactly where a flock of sheep was bitten
by ticks carrying a bacterial infection earlier this month [April
2007]. About 300 sheep were infected with tularemia, and 10 lambs
have died, the department reported Friday.
"That flock has been treated," said John Chatburn, deputy
administrator with the department, declining to identify the sheep
producer. "The Idaho Sheep Commission and the Idaho Wool Growers
Association have notified the sheep producers in that area, and given
them the information on the preventive measures they need to take to
treat their sheep," he said. "The Department of Agriculture has
notified the veterinarians in the state that we have had a case of
tularemia, and to be on the lookout for it."
Tularemia rarely has been seen in Idaho in the past decade, with 3
cases of human infection reported in the state during that time. The
disease is commonly carried by ticks, which bite their hosts and
transmit the infection. Without antibiotics, the infection can be
fatal.
The Department of Agriculture is not sure why there are more ticks
this year than in previous years, but speculates that weather may be
responsible. This uptick of ticks means higher possibilities of
insect-borne infections. "A number of the livestock producers in that
area have reported higher-than-usual concentrations of ticks,"
Chatburn said. "That would be probably due to environmental
conditions." Ticks tend to thrive in warm, dry regions, a description
southern Idaho fits after its mild winter, he said.
Marilyn Simunich, a veterinarian with the department, said she
worries that the outbreak of infection could worsen, particularly if
farmers don't take precautions to protect themselves and their
livestock. Signs of infection in sheep are not always obvious, she
said.
"They don't eat, they lay down. That's how sheep are; they don't show
a lot of signs, they act like they don't want to live," Simunich
said. "If they have a big tick infestation, they can become anemic
just from having ticks sucking on them."
Chatburn is asking all livestock producers to report tick
infestations and infected animals to their veterinarians. The vets
will pass those reports to the Department of Agriculture, which will
track the outbreak. "Farmers should be worried; they need to check
their livestock and see if they have an inordinate number of ticks on
them," he said. "Certainly animals in the area where the high
incidence of ticks are, are susceptible to it if they aren't treated
to get the ticks off them."
In cooperation with South Central District Health, the Department of
Agriculture is also warning humans against the tick-borne infection.
Ticks do not jump from host to host but spread through direct contact
with plants or animals that are carriers.
"Ticks potentially carry a number of diseases, and people who are out
in areas where they could have ticks get on them certainly need to
follow the advice and check themselves for ticks if they're out in
brushy areas," Chatburn said. He noted that ticks can carry a variety
of diseases, from tularemia to Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and that
these illnesses can be serious.
Cheryle Becker of District Health suggests wearing long clothing and
tucking pant legs into shoes when you walk in desert areas where
sagebrush grows. Afterward, thoroughly check all parts of your body,
with a mirror if necessary. If a tick is found, remove it carefully
with tweezers and watch yourself for symptoms of disease. "If you
find a tick and you develop an illness with that tick bite, you need
to have your doctor check it out," Becker said.
There have been 5 Idaho cases of tularemia infection since 1995,
Becker said, but no deaths attributed to the infection in the 25
years she has been with the department. Humans should take
precautions against contracting the infection from a tick during a
walk through sagebrush, Chatburn said, but they should not worry
about contracting it through the food chain. "None of those
particular sheep in that flock had reached the food channels," he
said. "If they had they would have been diagnosed at slaughter and
condemned because of the physiological changes that occur in sick
sheep."

[Tularemia is a potentially serious illness that occurs naturally in
the United States. It is caused by the bacterium _Francisella
tularensis_ found in animals (especially rodents, rabbits, and hares).
In domestic animals, sheep are the primary host, but clinical
infection has been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at
increased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an
increased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Little
is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in
domestic animals. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and
jackrabbits, beaver, muskrat, meadow voles, and sheep in North
America, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia.
The incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals, the
disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy,
anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with
septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased.
Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria may develop. Prostration and
death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best
recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may
have up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.
The most consistent lesions are miliary, white to off-white foci of
necrosis in the liver and sometimes in the spleen and lymph nodes.
Enlargement of the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes is common.
Organisms can be readily isolated from necropsy specimens by use of
special media. Risk of infection during necropsy or to laboratory
personnel is significant; special procedures and facilities are
essential.
Tularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases
(especially plague) or acute pneumonia. When large numbers of sheep
show typical signs during periods of heavy tick infestation,
tularemia or tick paralysis should be suspected. Tularemia should be
considered in cats with signs of acute lymphadenopathy, malaise, oral
ulcers, and history of recent ingestion of wild prey.
Diagnosis of acute infection is confirmed by culture and
identification of the bacterium, direct or indirect fluorescent
antibody test, or a 4-fold increase in antibody titer between acute
and convalescent serum specimens. A single titer of =1:80 by the tube
agglutination test is presumptive evidence of prior infection. When
tularemia is suspected, laboratory personnel should be alerted to
reduce the risk of laboratory-acquired infection.
Streptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are
effective at recommended dose levels; however, tetracycline and
chloramphenicol have been associated with relapses in people. Early
treatment should prevent death loss. Control is difficult and is
limited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and
treatment. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many
organisms are intracellular. Use of a vaccine previously available
for people at high risk of infection (e.g., laboratory personnel) is
currently under review. Recovery confers long-lasting immunity.
In people tularemia can be acquired through various routes including
being bitten by an infected tick, deerfly or other insect, handling
infected animal carcasses, eating or drinking contaminated food or
water or breathing in the bacterium, _F. tularensis_. Symptoms of
tularemia could include:sudden fever, chills, headaches, diarrhea,
muscle aches, joint pain, enlarged lymph nodes, especially under the
arms and in the groin, dry cough, an enlarging ulcerated area and
progressive weakness. People can also catch pneumonia and develop
chest pain, bloody sputum and can have trouble breathing and even
sometimes stop breathing.
Other symptoms of tularemia depend on how a person was exposed to the
tularemia bacterium. These symptoms can include ulcers on the skin or
mouth, swollen and painful lymph glands, swollen and painful eyes,
and a sore throat. If you suspect you may have the disease or have
some of the symptoms, consult your physician. The disease can be
treated with antibiotics.
