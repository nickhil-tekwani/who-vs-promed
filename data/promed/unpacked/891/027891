Further information on Recent Human Cases
-----------------------------------------
2 avian influenza patients remain under treatment. The Vietnamese authorities
reported 3 additional human cases of avian influenza in the last 2 weeks of
May, Tuoi Tre said. The 3 cases, including one death, were related to sick
poultry, said Trinh Quan Huan, head of the Preventive Medicine Department. The
other 2 patients, from the northern provinces Thanh Hoa and Vinh Phuc, were
still under treatment at the Institute of Tropical Diseases in Hanoi, he added.
The Vietnamese Health Ministry confirmed that 52 local people from 21 cities
and provinces had been infected with avian influenza virus between mid-
December 2004 and late May 2005, of whom 18 died. This wave of infections with
avian influenza (H5N1) virus has also seen 4 cases, all fatal, in Cambodia.
Since avian influenza broke out in Viet Nam in December 2003, the country has
detected a total of 79 human cases of infections in 28 cities and provinces,
including 38 fatalities.

[This report appears to confirm that the most recent human cases of avian
influenza H5N1 infection were contracted in mid-May 2005, and not in late
April 2005 as reported in Update 19 from WHO on the situation in Viet Nam
(see: Avian influenza, human - East Asia (82): Viet Nam 20050608.1592). -
