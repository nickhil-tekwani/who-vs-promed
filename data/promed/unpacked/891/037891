The last outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Argentina was reported to
the OIE in January 2002.
Translation of information received from Dr C Fernandez Madero, acting
president, National Agrifood Health and Quality Service (SENASA),
Secretariat for Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Food, Buenos Aires:
report date: 30 Aug 2003.
The National Health and Agrifood Quality Service (SENASA) confirmed the
presence of pigs with foot lesions in a municipal abattoir in the Tartagal
Department of the Province of Salta (on the Bolivian border).
The area allegedly affected lies inside the zone declared to be on foot and
mouth disease (FMD) alert since last July. All susceptible species in this
area are vaccinated and a programme of intensive surveillance is applied,
which includes reporting any signs compatible with the disease.
Samples were taken for carrying out laboratory diagnosis.
In addition, the following preliminary measures were immediately adopted
whilst awaiting the laboratory results:
- closure of the abattoir and a ban on the movement of all pigs present.
- establishment of a control and disinfection post at the entrance to the
abattoir in order to prevent the entry and exit of any vehicles, persons,
or animals.
- preventive closure of the abattoirs in Aguaray (12 km away from the area
under suspicion) and in Salvador Mazza (30 km away from the area under
suspicion), in addition to the vaccination of all susceptible animals
around them.
- blood sampling of pigs with foot lesions for laboratory diagnosis.
- preventive centripetal FMD vaccination, with revaccination of cattle and
vaccination of all other susceptible species (pigs, sheep, and goats)
within a 10 km radius of the abattoir.
- retrospective investigation.
- active surveillance of any clinical signs of the disease in the zone.
- ban on movements in the departments of San Martin and Rivadavia.
SENASA decided to invite professionals from the Pan American FMD Center to
come to the zone and carry out a joint assessment mission. Further details
will be published in the next issue of Weekly Disease Information,
available online on Fri 5 Sep 2003 afternoon (GMT).

[Please note a simple typographical error on the OIE website. The alert
message lists the report as "Foot and Mouth Disease in Paraguay," but the
actual link as given above is the correct one for Argentina, with the
details given above.
Given the recent FMD alerts in the border regions of Bolivia and Paraguay
-- which is close to the Salta region of Argentina -- the prudence of
Argentinian animal health officials in filing an OIE report is noted. As
mentioned previously, there are often cases picked up by cautious
surveillance that don't turn out to be FMD. This is particularly true with
pigs with foot lesions in an abattoir. We have to await confirmation. - Mod.PC]
