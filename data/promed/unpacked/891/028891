The culling of more than 16 000 chickens on a farm belonging to the
Mafra town council, 40 km [24.8 miles] from Lisbon, began today [31
Dec 2007] after detection of the H5 strain of avian influenza,
according to information released by the office of the Portuguese
Veterinary Director General (DGV).
The [official] note signaled that the farm is located within the
security perimeter established by the DGV after another [avian
influenza virus] strain of H5 -- not the virulent [H5] N1 strain --
was detected this past 21 Dec [2007] in a farm raising partridges.
The Portuguese authorities announced that they have established a new
security perimeter one km around the new outbreak, among other
sanitary measures.

H5N1 has never been reported from Portugal; the above newswire,
relating to H5, is the only publication on this issue which we have
been able to discover in the public media.
In September 2007, Portugal reported an outbreak of low-pathogenic
H5N2 in the Tomar region. Is the current outbreak caused by the same
virus? Information will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
