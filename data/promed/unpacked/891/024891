[After a 7 day hiatus with no newly confirmed MERS-CoV infections, a primary case with a history of direct exposure to camels was reported from Alkharj in Riyadh region today. During this period (since the last update with information through [21 Mar 2017]), there have been no further fatalities or recoveries reported.

Of note, we are now 14 days since the last reported confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection in the nosocomial outbreak in Wadi Aldawasir (also in Riyadh region, located approximately 589 km [approx. 366 mi] - to the southwest of Alkharj). Unless there is delayed notification of cases with dates of onset between 13 Mar 2017 and today [27 Mar 2017], it appears as though transmission in Wadi Aldawasir has been interrupted.

A map showing the location of Alkharj can be found at the source URL.
