Temecula Valley grape growers recently learned that a disease-carrying
leafhopper that threatens area vineyards is not just a local problem
anymore. Scientists and agriculture experts attending the Temecula
Winegrape Day and Trade Show on 26 March 1999 told an audience of about 75
that the glassy-winged sharpshooter that spreads the bacterium, _Xylella
fastidiosum_, the causal organism of Pierce's Disease, was discovered last
year in Temecula in the crop-rich Central Valley and has damaged the citrus
harvest in Ventura County. "There is also a potential loss for the avocado
industry in San Diego County," said Phil Phillips, farm advisor in Ventura
County.
Pierce's Disease wiped out 40,000 acres of vineyards and 50 wineries in the
Anaheim area a century ago. Infected plants die because water-conducting
vessels in infected plants are blocked. Infected vines were found in six
Temecula vineyards, three of which contained a "substantial proportion" of
infected plants, researchers said.
"This is just the beginning," said Roberto Ponte, grower and president of
the Temecula Winegrape Growers Association, which put on the event at
Callaway Vineyard and Winery. Although little is known about the leafhopper
that spreads the disease, university experts warned that steps need to be
taken now to minimize the disease's impact. "Money should not be a
restraint because this is a serious situation," said Alexander Purcell,
chairman of the Entomology Department at the University of California,
Berkeley.
A wet and cold spring curbed sharpshooter populations in the area during
the critical April-June breeding period last year, but despite sub-freezing
temperatures in December there is more sharpshooter activity than last year.
Unlike its related species found in other parts of the state, the
glassy-winged sharpshooter is larger and can fly greater distances. This
means it can infect plants farther away from its host plant, typically
citrus crops. As a result, the disease has spread throughout Temecula
vineyards, not just along the edges as is the case in other regions.
Scientists are assessing ways to limit infestations, including a promising
ground-applied insecticide, severe pruning of vines, and chemicals that
attack the bacterium. In addition, scientists are looking at how best to
use natural enemies of the sharpshooter -- a parasite that infects its eggs
and a predatory wasp.

[_Xylella fastidiosa_ occurs only in the Americas. In North America the
disease is limited to areas where winters are mild, i.e. all southern
states where grapevines are grown commercially. In California, the disease
is more prevalent in wetter environments which are also areas which support
growth of vegetation upon which the leafhopper vector feeds. The disease
also occurs in Mexico and Central America. X. fastidiosa clogs the xylem
in infected plants, causing wilting and death. In California, the
bacterium causes severe diseases in grapevine, almond and alfalfa and may
be the cause of a similar disease in oleander. - Mod.DH]
