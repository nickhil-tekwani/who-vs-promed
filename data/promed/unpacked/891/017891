We have received conclusive laboratory test results confirming that the patients originally believed to have measles do NOT have measles, but instead most likely have Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD). Over the past week, the Kadena Medical Clinic and US Naval Hospital Okinawa have reported several cases of HFMD in our beneficiary populations. Likewise, this disease has been reported in the local Japanese community.

HFMD is a common viral disease caused by several different viruses. It is normally seen in children under 5 years old; however, the current strain that is circulating throughout our community is also causing illnesses in adults. Additionally, the initial signs and symptoms of HFMC can be very similar to those of measles. HFMD is spread by contact with nose and throat secretions (coughing, sneezing, etc.), blister fluid, and stool. The virus is also able to remain on objects (e.g., doorknobs, toys, surfaces, etc.) for several hours.

Symptoms begin with a fever, poor appetite, and a mild feeling of being unwell. In 1-2 days, painful sores usually develop in the mouth. A rash will then show on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The rash may also appear in other areas. For more information about HFMD, visit: http://www.cdc.gov/hand-foot-mouth/index.html.

Health complications related to HFMD are quite uncommon. However, children may refuse to eat and drink because of the painful sores in the mouth. Please monitor your child for symptoms of dehydration. If dehydration is seen, please seek medical assistance.

There is no vaccine to protect against HFMD. People can lower their risk of being infected by any of the enteroviruses associated with HFMD by
- washing hands often with soap and water, especially after changing diapers and using the toilet. [Visit http://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/ for more information].
- cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces and soiled items, including toys
- avoiding close contact such as kissing, hugging, or sharing eating utensils or cups with people who [may be] infected with HFMD.

If you suspect that you or your child is ill with HFMD, you should not go to work, daycare, etc.

[Although measles virus and hand-foot-and-mouth disease virus may present clinically as similar conditions, they are caused by quite unrelated viruses. Strains of measles viruses are closely related and can only be distinguished by sophisticated tests. However, hand, foot and mouth disease may be caused by several distinct species of entrovirus. Most importantly, epidemics of measles can be prevented or controlled by use of a stable and effective vaccine. - Mod.CP
