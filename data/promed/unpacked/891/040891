[1] CDC update
Date: Thu 26 Aug 2010

<http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/enteritidis/>


Today's highlights
------------------
- From 1 May to 25 Aug 2010, a total of 2403 illnesses were reported.
- Don't eat recalled eggs. Recalled eggs might still be in grocery
stores, restaurants, and consumers' homes. Consumers who have
recalled eggs should discard them or return them to their retailer
for a refund. A searchable database of products affected by the
recall is available to consumers.
- Individuals who think they might have become ill from eating
recalled eggs should consult their health care providers.

CDC is collaborating with public health officials in multiple states,
the FDA, and the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service to
investigate a nationwide increase of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype]
Enteritidis (SE) infections with an indistinguishable pulsed-field
gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern JEGX01.0004. This is the most
common PFGE pattern for SE in the PulseNet database. Investigators
are using DNA analysis of _Salmonella_ bacteria obtained through
diagnostic testing to identify cases of illness that may be part of
this outbreak. Because the outbreak PFGE pattern (outbreak strain)
commonly occurs in the USA, some of the cases identified with this
outbreak strain may not be related to this outbreak.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
In early July 2010, CDC identified a nationwide sustained increase in
the number of _S._ Enteritidis isolates with PFGE pattern JEGX01.0004
uploaded to PulseNet, the national subtyping network made up of state
and local public health laboratories and federal food regulatory
laboratories that performs molecular surveillance of foodborne
infections. This increase began in May 2010, and is evident in the
epidemic curve, or epi curve. From 1 May to 25 Aug 2010, a total of
2403 illnesses were reported. However, some cases from this time
period have not been reported yet, and some of these cases may not be
related to this outbreak.

Based on the previous 5 years of reports to PulseNet, we would expect
approximately 933 total illnesses during this same period. Many
states have reported increases of this pattern since May [2010].
Because of the large number of expected cases during this period,
standard methods of molecular subtyping alone are not sufficient to
determine which reported cases might be outbreak-associated. CDC is
currently conducting testing using advanced molecular methodologies
to help distinguish between outbreak-related cases and sporadic (or
background) cases.

Illnesses that occurred after 23 Jul 2010 might not yet be reported
due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when
the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 3 weeks for
_Salmonella_.

Epidemiologic investigations conducted by public health officials in
10 states since April [2010] have identified 26 restaurants or event
clusters where more than a single ill person with the outbreak strain
has eaten. Data from these investigations suggest that shell eggs are
a likely source of infections in many of these restaurants or event
clusters. Preliminary information indicates that Wright County Egg,
in Galt, Iowa, was an egg supplier in 15 of these 26 restaurants or
event clusters. To date, no new restaurant or event clusters have
been reported to CDC. A formal traceback was conducted by state
partners in California, Colorado, and Minnesota, in collaboration
with FDA and CDC, to find a common source of shell eggs. Wright
County Egg in Iowa was found as the common source of the shell eggs
associated with 3 of the clusters. Through traceback and FDA
investigational findings, Hillandale Farms of IA, Inc. was identified
as another potential source of contaminated shell eggs contributing
to this outbreak. FDA is currently conducting extensive
investigations at both of these firms in Iowa. The investigations
involve sampling, records review, and looking for potential sources
of contamination, such as feed.

[2] "Smoking" chicken feed
Date: Fri 27 Aug 2010

Laboratory tests have confirmed that 2 Iowa egg companies are
contaminated with the same strain of _Salmonella_ blamed for a
national outbreak of illness, which continues to claim victims and
has sickened at least 1500 people, federal officials said Thursday
[26 Aug 2010].

The confirmation backs up suspicions by the FDA that tainted eggs
from the 2 Iowa producers have caused the biggest case of
_Salmonella_ Enteritidis disease that federal officials have seen
since they began tracking the illness in the 1970s.

The FDA, which has sent 20 investigators to the 2 farms -- Wright
County Egg and Hillandale Farms, said Thursday [26 Aug 2010] that it
had detected the particular strain of _Salmonella_ in 2 barns at
Wright County Egg and in feed that the company made and gave to its
own chickens. The agency also found that strain in feed that Wright
supplied to Hillandale.

"These are the very 1st results that we're beginning to get in, and
there are many other results in the queue that may give us clues as
to the \ extent of contamination," said Jeff Farrar, associate
commissioner for food protection at the FDA. He said that the agency
had taken 600 samples at the farms for laboratory analysis and that
additional results were expected.

Officials from Wright County Egg said in a statement that the
presence of _Salmonella_ on the property did not necessarily mean
that the eggs were infected. But the company also pledged to work with the FDA.

It was unclear how the feed or the barns became contaminated with bacteria.

Animal feed is generally heated to kill microbes, so it is possible
that the feed became contaminated after it arrived at Wright County
Egg, said Josh Sharfstein, deputy commissioner at the FDA.

"The feed facility is at the same location of all these problems,"
Sharfstein said, referring to Wright County Egg, which operates a
feed mill as well as hen-laying facilities and egg-processing plants.
"So there are multiple ways it may have become contaminated."

Under pressure from the FDA, Wright County Egg and Hillandale
recalled about 500 million eggs in the past 2 weeks and agreed not to
sell any shell eggs to the public until the FDA completes its
investigation and agrees to allow the companies to resume normal
operations. The companies supplied eggs that were sold under at least
25 brands.

In the meantime, the companies are selling their eggs to facilities
that pasteurize them, a process that kills salmonella, and they will
be used in liquid egg products or processed foods.

[The scope of this outbreak continues to increase. ProMED awaits more
information regarding better diagnostic studies of the outbreak
strain. "Smoking" chicken feed has been found on the source farms,
that is, the same strain has been isolated. Again, it cannot be
stressed enough -- in parallel to _E. coli_ O157:H7 in ground beef --
that almost all cases can be avoided with proper cooking and kitchen
hygiene. - Mod.LL]
