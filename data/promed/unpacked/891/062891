Malawi
• No case of WPV1 was reported this week. In February [2022], the country reported the 1st WPV1 case on the continent since 2016, with onset of paralysis in November 2021.
• Following the first of a series of multi-country outbreak response implemented in March [2022], preparations are ongoing in both Malawi and neighbouring countries for the subsequent campaigns.
• In total, at least 4, multi-country campaigns will be implemented. Round 2 was successfully implemented last week across the country, with almost 3 million children reached, with independent monitoring indicating 94% coverage achieved.
• Lessons learned from the 1st round helped inform preparations for the 2nd campaign, including focusing on further strengthened coordination at all levels, microplanning, training and supervision, social mobilization and increased social mobilization and mass media engagement.
• At the same time, surveillance continues to be strengthened including at critical subnational levels.

Mauritania
• No cVDPV2 positive environmental sample was reported this week. There were 7 positive samples linked to the Jigawa outbreak in 2021.

Mozambique
• Following confirmation of WPV1 last week, the Government of Malawi declared this outbreak to be a national public health emergency. The country is co-infected with WPV1 and cVDPV2.
• Genomic sequencing analysis indicates that the detected WPV1 is linked to a strain that had been circulating in Pakistan in 2019, similar to a WPV1 case reported in Malawi in February [2022].
• Detection of WPV1 in Mozambique confirms ongoing WPV1 transmissions in the sub-region. Mozambique has been actively participating in the multi-country emergency outbreak response implemented across the sub-region in response to the detected WPV1 in Malawi, alongside Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe to reach more than 23 million children across the region during at least 4 multi-country emergency outbreak response campaigns. 2 rounds of bivalent OPV have already been implemented, the most recent at end-April [2022], with more than 4.2 million children vaccinated in Mozambique. At the same time, response in the country to the cVDPV2 outbreak is also ongoing.
• National and subnational authorities continue to be supported by partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, notably by experts of the African Rapid Response Team and the GPLN.
• Detection of this most recent case underscores the appropriateness of the large-scale, rapid, multi-country emergency outbreak response across south-east Africa, in line with revised international polio outbreak response SOPs. The overriding priority is to continue to implement the subregional emergency response, by continuing to conduct large-scale, rapid and high-quality response campaigns.
• WHO considers there to be a continued high risk of international spread of this WPV1, particularly across the south-east subregion of Africa, due to persisting subnational immunity and surveillance gaps and large-scale population movements. The risk is magnified by decreased immunization rates related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Niger
• 1 case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported in Tillaberi making it the 2nd in 2022. There were 17 cases reported in 2021.
• 1 cVDPV2 positive environmental sample was reported in Niamey.

Nigeria
• No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported this week. The number of 2022 cases remains 24. There were 415 cases reported in 2021.

Occupied Palestinian Territory
• No cVDPV3 positive environmental samples were reported this week.
• Bivalent OPV campaigns using fixed sites and mobile teams are being implemented in Bethlehem and Jerusalem, with R1 in mid-May [2022] and R2 a month later [June 2022].

[The above weekly report is very disconcerting. Overall there are 10 countries with evidence of circulation of polioviruses -- 2 countries with WPV1 and 8 with cVDPV2.\

There is the official confirmation of the 3rd WPV1 case in Pakistan (see Poliomyelitis update (18): WPV1 AFP Pakistan, cVDPV2 AFP, CVDPV3, violence 20220518.8703319 for the media report announcing the 3rd case), in addition to the positive environmental sample for WPV1 in Afghanistan -- confirming the continued circulation of the wild poliovirus in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Further disconcerting are the number of countries with ongoing cVDPV2 circulation reported in the past week -- 8 -- 4 with AFP cases (Chad, DR Congo, Niger, Yemen) and an additional 4 with no AFP cases but positive environmental samples (Djibouti, Ghana, Nigeria, Somalia). With this week's cases, both WPV1 and cVDPV cases reported to date in 2022 are more than those reported to date in 2021, suggesting increased pockets of susceptible individuals.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Pakistan WPV1 - 4th AFP case

Pakistan reports 4th polio case in one month
--------------------------------------------
After having remained polio free for 15 months, the country on Wednesday [25 May 2022] reported the 4th polio case in one month.

The victim is a 13-month-old boy who has been paralysed by wild poliovirus in the Mir Ali area of North Waziristan tribal district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The case was confirmed by the Pakistan National Polio Laboratory at the National Institute of Health. This is the 3rd polio case from Mir Ali this year [2022].

"Another child in North Waziristan has been paralysed by wild poliovirus. This 13-month-old child will live with disabilities for the rest of his life because of a virus that is entirely preventable. This is a collective loss for Pakistan," said Health Minister Abdul Qadir Patel. "Over 99% of the world is now polio-free. Our children also deserve a life free from this incurable disease," he added.

"All parents must realise the risk that wild polio continues to pose to children all over Pakistan. Please ensure that your children are vaccinated in the ongoing nationwide campaign being conducted in all 156 districts of the country," he said.

According to preliminary investigations, the child had not received any dose of oral polio vaccine.

According to a statement, all children confirmed with wild polio this year [2022] belong to North Waziristan, where more cases are expected due to high refusal rates and instances of finger-marking without vaccination during the campaigns.

The nationwide immunisation campaign started on [23 May 2022] and will continue across the country till [27 May 2022].
