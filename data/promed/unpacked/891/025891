[These yellow fever (YF) virus infections were reported as sylvan transmission cycle occurrences and not acquired in urban settings.

The epidemiological bulletin covers the period in 2015 up to epidemiological week 34 ending 29 Sep 2015. No details of these cases are provided other than the numbers of cases by department and region.

ProMED would appreciate receiving additional information including specific dates when the cases occurred, their sex and ages and outcome of the infection, as well as any occurrence of infected monkeys.

YF virus is endemic in the tropical areas of South America including the Amazon Basin of Peru, where sporadic cases occur. Individuals traveling or working in these remote, forested areas often are not vaccinated and become infected with YF virus. The risk is that, should viremic individuals travel to nearby villages where the urban vector mosquito is present and villagers have not been vaccinated, an urban transmission cycle could be initiated. There were sylvan YF cases in Peru in 2013 and 2014 (see archives below).

[These cases do not appear anywhere in the outbreak reports on the WHO or PAHO websites accessed today, 4 Oct 2015. ProMED would be interested to know the reason. - Mod.JW]

The Federal District [DF] Secretariat of Health this Friday (2 [Oct 2015]) vaccinated people who live or work in the Lago Norte area, in those areas considered at risk for transmission of yellow fever. This situation was identified after a group of monkeys was found dead, in areas near houses and farms of the region. This action began on Wed (30 [Sep 2015]) and will continue until 7 [Oct 2015].

The Director of Epidemiological Surveillance of the DF, Cristina Segatto, stated that this action is to prevent and try to avoid possible transmission of the disease [virus] to people. "Whenever Environmental Surveillance encounters dead or ill animals, especially monkeys, these people send samples for [laboratory] testing and to promote vaccination in neighboring areas, even though yellow fever is not confirmed," she said. [But it was confirmed in this case -- see below and 3 weeks ago on ProMED Yellow fever - Americas (11): Brazil (DF) 20150916.3648527. YF vaccination requires 10 days to be fully effective. - Mod.JW] "In Lago Norte and in Asa Norte [Olhos d'Agua Park], the [cases] are still suspected ones. [This conflicts with the statement below: "tests for these animals were positive for yellow fever." - Mod.JW]

"A veterinarian, for example, stated that a monkey died from electrocution on an electric fence, we continue with all the appropriate procedures. There is no reason for panic or fear -- this is an accompanying measure," said Cristina.

Since the beginning of the year [2015], Public Health of the DF received 3 patients with yellow fever. According to the government, all of them acquired the infection in other places of the country and sought treatment in the federal capital. No transmission [in the DF] has been registered in 2015.

According to the Secretariat of Health, there is no ongoing vaccination campaign. The efforts have been concentrated and were carried out in other regions of the DF since the beginning of the year [2015]. Residents of farms in Ceilandia and those working in the Brazilia Zoo were immunized after the monkeys were found dead in nearby places. [Laboratory] tests for these animals were positive for yellow fever.

"People who need this protection are vaccinated; they are are those who live nearby the areas where the sylvatic virus was found. Also, those who live in residential areas also need to be continuously protected, with doses applied every 10 years. [WHO recently controversially extended the validity of the YF vaccination to lifelong, but some port/airport health personnel may not be aware of this. - Mod.JW]

Those in doubt can bring their vaccination cards to a [health] post to find out if it [vaccination] is necessary," said the Director of Epidemiological Surveillance.

Cristina said that delivery of vaccine doses from the Ministry of Health, which had been restricted during the 1st 6 months of 2015, was normal since Wed 30 [Sep 2015]. With this, immunization must be available in all the health posts where there are vaccination rooms.

[There is still no mention of the species of monkeys involved in this situation -- probably howler monkeys (_Alouatta_ spp.). Finding dead monkeys that test postive for yellow fever (YF) virus is clear indication that the sylvan (forest) cycle of virus transmission is active and poses a significant risk of infection for both humans and non-human primates. Vaccination of humans in the general area is a very prudent public health measure.

These primate cases do not appear anywhere in outbreak reports on the WHO or PAHO websites accessed today, 4 Oct 2015, in spite of being
officially confirmed. But before the revised International Health Regulations (IHR) entered into force, countries were obliged to report even suspected cases of YF in monkeys to WHO Geneva. That seems to have been forgotten.
