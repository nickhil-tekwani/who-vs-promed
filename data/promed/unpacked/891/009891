An unknown hemorrhagic fever whose symptoms are similar to those caused by
Ebola virus, has killed 17 persons in Uganda, according to responsible
health officials of this country. The Ugandan Ministry of Health and the
World Health Organization (WHO) are working on the identification of this
fever, which produces hemorrhages, headaches, vomiting and diarrhea. The
cases have been turned over to the National Center of Virus Studies. The
cases were reported in Duruba, in the district of Arua, in the northwest of
Uganda.

[The Uganda-knowledgeable Jack Woodall comments: "This could be an
extension of the outbreak of Marburg fever at the goldmine in DR Congo.
Arua is on the main road from the border with the affected area of DR
Congo." - Mod. CHC]
