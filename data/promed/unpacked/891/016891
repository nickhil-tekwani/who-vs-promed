Honduras destroys 45 000 birds in Newcastle outbreak
----------------------------------------------------
Authorities in Honduras have destroyed more than 45 000 birds after an
outbreak of Newcastle disease, according to a world animal health
organization. The International Epizootic Office (OIE) said Friday in a
report posted on its Web site the outbreak had occurred in poultry farms
in the Central American country's Francisco Morazan and Cortes
departments.
The OIE site did not specify what kind of birds were affected, except to
say the outbreak was at poultry farms in Honduras. No one was available
at OIE to clarify the information.
It said the first infection had probably occurred in early December, but
the disease had not been detected until late January. OIE said the
affected farms were under quarantine.
OIE said in a report last week Mexico had destroyed 9800 birds in
January because of an outbreak of Newcastle disease in the state of
Durango.
Newcastle Disease is a contagious and fatal viral illness affecting all
species of birds. Chickens are the most susceptible poultry, while ducks
and geese are the least susceptible poultry. A death rate of almost 100
percent can occur in unvaccinated poultry flocks.
The disease does not affect human consumers of poultry products, although
people working with infected live birds can contract a mild case of
conjunctivitis.
Mexico last year killed 6 million chickens because of an outbreak of the
same viral disease, which can infect all bird species.
