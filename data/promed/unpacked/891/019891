Rift Valley fever in Yemen - WHO Update 4
-----------------------------------------
As of Thu 19 Oct 2000, the Ministry of Public Health in Yemen has reported
653 suspected cases, including 80 deaths.
Laboratory testing has confirmed the disease in humans and animals in 4
Governorates: Hodeidah, Hajjah, Mahweet and Sadeh and there is serologic
evidence of the disease in animals in Dhamar Governorate. Surveillance and
control activities are ongoing. Although the disease is restricted to the
northwestern part of the country, areas to the southwest are now
experiencing evidence of Rift Valley fever transmission. There is persistent
transmission in El-Zuhrah district, Hodeidah Governorate despite extensive
and vigorous mosquito control activities.
A team of epidemiologists will be carrying out a survey in El-Zuhrah
district to assess the importance of direct animal contact versus exposure
to mosquitoes as a risk factor for disease. It will also assess the economic
impact of the outbreak on the community.
