Authorities in Ntungamo District have closed livestock markets as a measure to fight the foot & mouth disease and anthrax in the area.

At least 15 cows have died of anthrax in Ngoma Sub-county in the last 2 weeks, according to the district veterinary officer, Dr Yake Basulira. Foot & mouth disease was confirmed in Ihunga Sub-county recently. "We have closed all animal markets in the district and this is intended to control the diseases as we move to vaccinate all livestock to stop further spread. If we keep the animals moving, it is hard to stop further spread," Dr Basulira said on Mon [25 Jul 2016].

Ngoma Sub-county, which borders Rwanda, is the only area that has registered anthrax infection. The disease has not been registered in the region in the recent years.

Meanwhile, Isingiro District has registered a foot & mouth disease case. The district veterinary officer, Dr Bruhan Kasozi, on Tue [26 Jul 2016] said the disease was confirmed in Busheeka, Endinzi Sub-county, on [18 Jul 2016]. He said the owner of the affected animal bought it from the neigbouring Rakai District. Isingiro has had intermittent foot & mouth disease outbreak especially in Endinzi, Mbaare and Kashumba sub-counties. Livestock markets in the area have remained closed for 10 years to fight the disease that mainly spreads from livestock farms in Tanzania. "We have been getting episodes of foot & mouth disease, but have been able to contain the disease by vaccination and closing communal livestock markets," Dr Kasozi said.

[Ntungamo is in south west Uganda and on the Rwanda border and therefore always at risk of animals brought in from there; see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ntungamo

It is vital that they get their stock vaccinated against FMD as soon as possible, as well as for anthrax in the affected sub-district. - Mod.MHJ
