A contaminated blood thinner from China has been found in drug
supplies in 11 countries, and federal officials said Monday [21 Apr
2008] they had discovered a clear link between the contaminant and
severe reactions now associated with 81 deaths in the USA. But a
Chinese official disputed the assertion that the contaminant found in
the drug, heparin, caused any deaths and insisted that his country's
inspectors be allowed to inspect the American plant where the
finished heparin vials were made. He said any future agreement to
allow American inspections of Chinese firms should be reciprocal.

"We don't have strong evidence to show that it is heparin or its
contaminant that caused the problem," said the official, Ning Chen,
2nd secretary at the Chinese Embassy. Mr Chen said that illnesses
associated with contaminated heparin had occurred only in the USA,
which he said suggested that the problem arose in this country.

Dr Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's [US Food & Drug
Administration] drug center, said that German regulators uncovered a
cluster of illnesses among dialysis patients who took contaminated
heparin. She said Chinese officials had conceded that heparin
produced in their country contained a contaminant, though they say it
was not connected to the illnesses. "Heparin should not be
contaminated, regardless of whether or not that contamination caused
acute adverse events," Dr Woodcock said. "We are fairly confident
based on the biological information that we have had that this
contaminant is capable of triggering these adverse reactions."

The FDA sent a warning letter on Monday [21 Apr 2008] to Changzhou
SPL, the Chinese plant identified as the source of contaminated
heparin made by Baxter International in the USA. It warned that the
plant used unclean tanks to make heparin, that it accepted raw
materials from an unacceptable vendor, and that it had no adequate
way to remove impurities.

Heparin is made from the mucous membranes of the intestines of
slaughtered pigs that, in China, are often cooked in unregulated
family workshops. The contaminant, identified as oversulfated
chondroitin sulfate, a cheaper substance, slipped through the usual
testing and was recognized only after more sophisticated tests were
used.

The FDA has identified 12 Chinese companies that have supplied
contaminated heparin to 11 countries -- Australia, Canada, China,
Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
and the USA. Deborah Autor, director of compliance at the FDA's drug
center, said the agency did not know the original source of all the
contamination or the points in the supply chain at which it was added.

Officials have discovered heparin lots that included the cheap
additive manufactured as early as early as 2006, although a spike in
illnesses associated with contaminated heparin began in November 2007
and persisted through February 2008, officials said.

Dr Woodcock said the Chinese had agreed to test heparin lots before
allowing them to be exported. But Dr Moheb Nasr, director of the drug
agency's office of new drug quality assessment, said that the Chinese
test might not be sensitive enough to identify the contaminant. Dr
Woodcock assured patients, however, that all heparin supplies in the
USA had been tested with the most sensitive assays and had been found
to be uncontaminated.

Scientific Protein Laboratories and Changzhou SPL said the company
regretted the agency's decision to send a warning letter that, it
said, did not reflect the company's current safety practices. The
company said it had no way of detecting a contaminant present in
heparin supplies throughout China.

Baxter International, which bought heparin ingredients from SPL and
sold the finished drug in the USA, said that its tests confirmed that
the contaminant could cause illness. It disputed the FDA's analysis
that its product was linked with 81 deaths, saying it had identified
only 5 in which its product "may have contributed to the adverse
outcome, though there is not yet enough medical data available to
draw a firm conclusion that the reaction caused the death."

Deaths linked to the drug may have been concentrated in the USA
because American doctors may be more likely to use large, quickly
infused amounts of the drug, said drug officials. Also, the FDA may
track serious side effects better than its counterparts abroad.

[The underlying pathophysiology of these reactions remains uncertain.
It would be useful if an animal model could be used to investigate
this outbreak further. Additionally, both the initial source of the
contaminant and whether its introduction was accidental or purposeful
are unknown. - Mod.LL]
