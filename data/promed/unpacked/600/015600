The year [1998] was marked by an increase of nearly 100% in cholera cases on
all continents.
Although there was no new major event which could have contributed to
increased transmission (such as population movements or wide-spread natural
disasters), all continents have independently reported more cholera cases
than in 1997. Cholera caused by _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 biotype El Tor, a
strain which first appeared in Indonesia in 1961 and has spread world-wide
ever since, has continued to occur, causing major epidemics.
A total of 293 121 cases and 10 586 deaths were reported to WHO in 1998.
Compared to 1997, this represents an increase of almost double the number of
cases (147 425 cases in 1997). Africa again accounted for the largest part,
with 72% of the global total. The global case-fatality rate (CFR) decreased
slightly, from 4.3% in 1997 to 3.6% in 1998. Cholera cases were notified by
74 countries, an increase of 9 countries compared to 1997. The numbers are
presumed to be even higher, owing to asymptomatic infections,
under-reporting and other limitations of surveillance systems.
Of all continents, Africa suffered the most with 29 countries reporting
cholera to WHO. The sudden increase of cholera at the end of 1997 in the
Horn of Africa continued throughout 1998 and spread to many other countries
in the region, with a clear recrudescence in West Africa. The countries
where major outbreaks occurred in 1998 are: Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Kenya, Mozambique, Uganda and United Republic of Tanzania. The number
of cases reported from these countries ranged from 14 488 to 49 514.
In the Americas the number of cases had continued to decline up to 1997
after the disease had re-emerged along the Peruvian coastline in January
1991, but another resurgence was recorded in 1998. The total number of
cases reported rose from 17 760 in 1997 to 57 106 in 1998. This increase was
primarily attributable to the continuing effects of major disasters caused
by the El Niño phenomenon and Hurricane Mitch.
The increase in cholera cases on all continents is considered to be
similarly related to climate changes following the El Niño phenomenon which
has created conditions favorable for cholera outbreaks worldwide. The
devastation which has resulted is so severe that it is likely to take
decades before the infrastructure and basic services in some of the affected
areas regain their previous levels. The number of persons now vulnerable to
cholera has dramatically increased worldwide and this is creating conditions
favourable for a global cholera crisis...
