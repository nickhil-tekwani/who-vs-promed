Aside from the dangers of dengue fever, during changing season such as this one, the citizens were asked to be vigilant with other diseases such as chikungunya [virus infection], because in East Jakarta, based on the local Health Sub Department, there are 165 citizens who suffered from that disease.

Those 165 chikungunya sufferers consist of 10 citizens in Palmeriam Urban Village, 22 citizens in Cakungbarat, 15 citizens in Jatinegara, 20 citizens in Pondokkelapa, 11 citizens in Rawaterate, 16 citizens in Pondokbambu, 6 citizens in Cipinangmelayu, 16 citizens in Halim Perdanakusumah, 25 citizens in Makasar, and 24 citizens in Pondokkopi. "From this number, there are no dead people," said Safarudin, Head of East Jakarta Health Sub Department, Tuesday (7 May 2013).

Probably, such data will change by the end of this year [2013]. However, citizens are urged to remain calm and need not worry, because chikungunya disease is not [more] dangerous than dengue fever.

He said the number of chikungunya sufferers in East Jakarta is relatively high, caused by low citizen awareness to [maintain] hygiene and [a] healthy lifestyle. "With anti-mosquito campaigns and "Hygiene and Health Lifestyle Behavior" [these] are the best solutions to handle dengue fever and chikungunya," he said.

Especially for chikungunya, sufferers will feel weak and sore in their bodies. "Especially in their joints, but it is not too dangerous. For those who had fever accompanied by sore and rheumatic pain in the joints, they must be taken to the nearest community health center," he concluded.

[Within the past 7 months in Indonesia, there have been cases of chikungunya virus infection in Bali, West Sumatra, Central Java, and West Java. A cleanup of water catchment breeding sites should help reduce the population of _Aedes aegypti_, the likely vector of chikungunya virus in these areas. There is no vaccine available to prevent chikungunya virus infections. Control of vector mosquito populations and avoidance of their bites are the only feasible preventive measures.
