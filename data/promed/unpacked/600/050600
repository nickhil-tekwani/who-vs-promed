In what may be this season's first outbreak nationally, 2 flu cases have
been confirmed and at least 68 more are being investigated at a children's
camp south of Waco, health officials say. Most of the campers, who are
being treated, are from Dallas, Houston and Oklahoma. It wasn't known
yesterday if any are from Tarrant County.
There's no evidence that the viral illness has spread outside the McLennan
County camp, said David Bergmire-Sweat, a Texas Department of Health
epidemiologist. It's unclear how the outbreak started, he said. "I don't
think we know what it means for the flu in Texas," Bergmire-Sweat said.
"What we are trying to do is get this outbreak under control. And if we are
able to do that, that should take care of the question of it spreading."
It's important for local physicians to watch for it to appear locally, said
Dr. Donald Murphey, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Cook
Children's Medical Center. Yesterday, Murphey notified Cook Children's
network of physicians. "Pediatricians recognize influenza all the time,"
Murphey said. "But we don't think about it in the middle of summer."
The first flu-like symptoms in campers and staffers were identified about
10 days ago, said Larry Holze, spokesman for the Waco-McLennan County
Public Health District. Greene Family Camp, operated by the Union of
American Hebrew Congregations, is located near Bruceville between Waco and
Temple. It has about 425 campers, ages 9 to 16, and more than 150 staffers,
he said. The camp has worked closely with health officials and kept parents
informed, Holze said. Camp officials couldn't be reached late yesterday.
Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is traditionally a winter illness
that can begin as early as October or November. Usually, it is over by
spring. Without vaccine protection, it can be fatal, especially in the
elderly.
Sporadic cases do appear in the summer, as well as an occasional outbreak,
said Tom Skinner, spokesman for the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. In recent years, for example, there have been some
outbreaks on cruise ships. But this year, Skinner said, "We have not seen
any outbreaks like this around the country yet."
The central Texas outbreak follows news from the CDC that this season's
vaccine will be delivered late. One of the three strains to be included in
the vaccine is slow growing, CDC officials say. There may be a month's
delay in delivery and the shots may not be available until November.
State health officials, who are now working with CDC officials, haven't
identified the viral strain. Bergmire-Sweat couldn't say how long that
would take.
Each year, about 20 000 Americans die of the respiratory illness, which can
trigger bacterial pneumonia and other life-threatening complications. Older
adults and younger people with immune system problems are considered most
vulnerable.
The sick children have been kept isolated in one area of the camp, Holze
said. None of the campers have left without getting preventive medication,
Holze said. And parents are being alerted to watch for flu-like symptoms,
he said.
