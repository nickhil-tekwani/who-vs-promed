West Nile Virus Found in Crows and Horses in North Carolina
-----------------------------------------------------------
RALEIGH: The State Public Health Laboratory today reported that 5 new cases
of West Nile virus have been found in North Carolina. The cases include 2
crows in Currituck County, one crow in Mecklenburg County, one horse in
Hyde County, and one horse in Camden County. Earlier findings of West Nile
virus in the state this year include a blue jay found in Cabarrus County
and a crow found in Camden County, both reported in September.
When West Nile virus was first detected in the state on 17 Sep 2001, acting
State Health Director Leah Devlin issued a Public Health Warning advising
residents to be diligent in protecting themselves against mosquito bites.
This warning remains in effect.
West Nile virus was first detected in North Carolina last year in a dead
crow found at Jordan Lake State Park in Chatham County by a conservation
biologist with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It is important to
remember that the virus is transmitted to humans when a mosquito bites an
infected bird and then bites a human. It is not known to pass directly from
birds to humans or from human to human.
West Nile virus originates from Africa, west Asia, and Europe. It was first
found in the United States in the summer of 1999 in New York City. Since
then West Nile Virus has spread down the eastern seaboard of the United
States and to Midwestern and Gulf states. With the addition of North
Carolina, 20 states and the District of Columbia have now reported evidence
of the virus. The other states are Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia,
Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Mississippi, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, and Virginia.
Any decision to spray for mosquitoes will be made by local health officials
based upon a number of factors, including whether the area of concern is
densely populated and weather patterns. Experts with the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources' Public Health Pest Management Section
will collect and test mosquitoes and wild birds in the area to look for
further evidence of the virus. Surveillance for the presence of West Nile
virus in the rest of the state through mosquito and dead bird collection
and testing will continue.
