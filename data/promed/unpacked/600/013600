[During December 2018, HPAI subtype H5N8 was also reported in Tehran (1 outbreak) and East Azerbaijan (3 outbreaks). Both events are still continuing.

See event summary and updated map from these events at:

Tehran event: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=28607

East Azerbaijan event: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=28881

"Since HPAI H5N8 subtypes cause high mortality in domestic poultry, veterinary services in at-risk countries have recommended increased prevention efforts through bio-security to minimize contact between wild birds and poultry and enhanced surveillance and preparedness. They are also strengthening their wild bird surveillance activities in areas where viruses have been detected and in other areas where there are significant populations of migratory waterfowl.

"The majority of wild bird migration across Europe, Africa, and Asia subsides after the winter season. While wintering locations of these migratory birds are often stable, additional movement within a region may be affected by local weather conditions, food resources, access to open water, etc." Source: http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/OIE_AI_situation_report/OIE_SituationReport_AI_August2018.pdf. - Mod.CRD
