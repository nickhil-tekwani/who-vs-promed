Native Australian Viruses May Prevent Spread of Japanese Encephalitis Virus
----------------------------------
Scientists at CSIRO's [Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organisation top-security Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) in
Geelong stated that it was inevitable that Japanese encephalitis would
become established in Australia. The only known case on the Australian
mainland was a Cape York fisherman who became ill in 1998, while the first
known outbreak killed 2 people in the Torres Strait 5 years ago.
However, the good news is that tests by CSIRO scientists on feral pigs
showed that 2 native viruses protected the pigs against Japanese
encephalitis virus infection and acted as a natural barrier to the
disease. AAHL veterinary virologist, Peter Daniels, stated that blood
samples from feral pigs showed they were often repeatedly infected with
Murray Valley encephalitis virus and Kunjin virus, which appeared to stop
the growth of Japanese encephalitis virus. Other good news discovered
recently at AAHL was that kangaroos and wallabies could not spread Japanese
encephalitis.

Kangaroos And Wallabies Are Unlikely Hosts For Japanese Encephalitis Virus
-------------------------------------------
Kangaroos and wallabies are unlikely to provide a foothold for the lethal
Japanese encephalitis virus, should it take root in Australia. Research by
the CSIRO [Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation
Livestock Industries Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) for the
Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) shows that Eastern Grey
Kangaroos, Tammar Wallabies and Agile Wallabies do not provide a ready
'host' for Japanese encephalitis virus.
AQIS veterinarian Mr. Tim Buick says Japanese encephalitis virus is common
throughout Southeast Asia, and has been detected in Australia. Its first
appearance in the Torres Strait Islands in 1995 killed 2 people, while in
1998 a fisherman working in the Cape York Peninsula became ill with the
disease but survived.
To ensure early detection and response should Japanese encephalitis virus
enter Australia, AQIS's Northern Australia Quarantine Strategy monitors for
[presence of the virus, in collaboration with Queensland Health, by flying
'sentinel' pigs to high-risk sites across northern Australia each wet
season. Quarantine scientists bleed the pigs fortnightly and send blood to
AAHL for testing. In the event of a detection, State or Territory health
authorities warn communities and advise of appropriate precautions. "While
most infections with Japanese encephalitis virus do not result in disease,
it can cause disease of the brain in humans and horses. On some occasions
the disease can be fatal and more frequently recovery is not complete. The
virus is transmitted in a natural cycle between mosquitoes and birds, but
the virus can rapidly multiply in pigs and then be carried by mosquitoes to
infect other animals," stated Mr. Buick.
"Quarantine's role is to monitor for [the presence of Japanese encephalitis
virus in Australia and to understand how it might behave if it were to
become established here. Since routes of entry for Japanese encephalitis
virus could include migrating birds, we can't necessarily keep this virus
out of Australia. What we can do is be prepared by anticipating the risks
posed by its future presence in Australia, and this research is one element
of this proactive response," he added.
AAHL project coordinator, Dr. Peter Daniels, says the project also looked
at how the virus may behave in the feral pig population. "We have 2
viruses in Australia which are closely related to Japanese encephalitis
virus; Murray Valley encephalitis virus and Kunjin virus. Our research
shows that Murray Valley encephalitis virus can act like a natural vaccine
against Japanese encephalitis, and suggests that Kunjin virus may act in
the same way, but to a lesser extent."
Dr. Daniels said this was good news for Australia, as it meant that the
presence of the Australian viruses, although posing other health risks, may
lessen the potential spread of Japanese encephalitis virus in feral pigs,
and thereby dampen the spread of Japanese encephalitis virus to the human
and horse populations.
