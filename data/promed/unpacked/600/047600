Since last September [2011], goat meat has not been consumed in the
municipality of Giharo [map at http://healthmap.org/r/1pFd]. A viral
disease has been indicated; over 300 goats have been slaughtered.
Health officials say that slaughter is the only solution.

The Provincial Directorate of Agriculture and Livestock [DPAE,
Direction provinciale d'agriculture et de l'elevage] in Rutana has
banned the consumption of meat from goats and sheep due to a viral
disease. According to Hermenegilde Butunagu, head of livestock in
DPAE, the ban is of particular significance to the population along
Tanzania's borders, beyond which the disease is claimed to originate.
"This disease can be transmitted to humans if contaminated meat is
eaten," he stressed.

Some people claim that the disease appeared with goats from Tanzania
and was distributed to the population by [an NGO (Non-Governmental
Organisation), name omitted]. This version of the events was confirmed
by Hermenegilde Butunagu. The suspicion of a viral infection is
supported by the fact that the NGO did not treat the animals with
antibiotics. "The DPAE recommended the systematic elimination of all
infected goats and sheep to protect those who are still healthy. In
all, 325 goats were burned and buried."

According to the administrator of the municipality of Giharo, Gilbert
Nyandwi, the slaughtered animals were burnt to prevent their
consumption. He said that awareness meetings had been organized for
the public: "The farmers were asked not to bring goats from
Tanzania."

It is hoped that these measures will be effective and that within a
few weeks, the situation will return to normal.

[Though the newswire raises the suspicion of a zoonotic disease, data
to support this suspicion are not included.

In case this is indeed a public-health issue, main suspect viral
zoonotic diseases which can be transmitted by small ruminants are Rift
Valley fever (RVF) and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). The
most recent outbreak of RVF in Tanzania was recorded in 2007.

The little and blurred information included does not allow further
speculation, though if a foodborne infection is at play, bacterial
diseases deserve consideration as well, with special reference to
_Brucella melitensis_.

Earlier this year [2011], an undiagnosed epizootic in goats was
unofficially reported from north Burundi; ProMED-mail posted an RFI
(20110917.2830).

More and detailed information on both events are requested. - Mod.AS]
