Hand, Foot And Mouth Disease Outbreak Reported In Philippines
-------------------------------------------------------------
MANILA: Four Filipino children have been infected with a viral disease
similar to the one that killed at least 4 children in neighbouring
Singapore earlier in the month, the Philippines' Health Department said on
Thursday. Health secretary Alberto Romualdez said the afflicted children
were already undergoing treatment in different hospitals in metropolitan
Manila. "The 4 cases that we discovered were mild, but we are closely
watching the patients."
Blood samples have been sent to Australia in order to [establish whether
[the virus responsible for the disease in the Philippines resembles any of
the agents isolated in Malaysia and Singapore. Romualdez said that based on
the department's initial investigation of the 4 cases, the virus was not
imported. The disease, which is spread through direct contact with infected
persons, killed at least 4 children and afflicted hundreds in Singapore
and Malaysia since September. All quarantine offices nationwide have been on
alert against the entry of people afflicted with the hand, foot and mouth
disease since the outbreak in Singapore and Malaysia.

[Epidemics of hand, foot & mouth disease are currently affecting children in
Malaysia, Singapore and more recently Sri Lanka. The Malaysian and
Singaporean outbreaks have been attributed variously to infection by
Enterovirus 71, Echovirus 7, and possibly other enteroviruses. The outbreak
in the Philippines is not at the moment as serious as the Malaysian and
Singaporean outbreaks, and may have an independent origin. The nature of the
evidence for this is not clear, however. - Mod.CP
