Epidemic cholera in Burundi: patterns of transmission in the Great Rift
Valley Lake region - Birmingham ME, et al:
Summary: After a 14-year hiatus, epidemic cholera swept through Burundi
between January and May, 1992. The pattern of transmission was similar to
that in 1978, when the seventh pandemic first reached this region.
Communities affected were limited to those near Lake Tanganyika and the
Rusizi River. The river connects Lake Tanganyika with Lake Kivu to the north
in Zaire and Rwanda. To identify sources of infection and risk factors for
illness, an epidemiological study was carried out in Rumonge, a lake-shore
town where 318 people were admited to hospital with cholera between April 9
and May 31, 1992. The investigation included a case-control study of 56
case-patients and 112 matched controls.=20
The study findings suggested that exposure to the lake was a risk factor for
illness. Comparison of the 56 case-patients with matched controls showed
that bathing in the lake and drinking its water were independently and
significantly linked with illness. No food-borne risk factors were=
identified.=20
Vibrio cholera O1 was isolated from Lake Tanganyika during, but not after,
the outbreak in Rumonge. Isolates from the lake and from patients with acute
watery diarrhoea had the same serotype, biotype, and antimicrobial
susceptibility profiles. The number of cases rapidly declined when access to
the lake was blocked.=20
This study identified bathing in contaminated surface water as a major risk
factor for cholera in sub-Saharan Africa, and suggests that improving the
quality of drinking water alone will have only limited impact on the
transmission of the disease in the Great Rift Valley Lake region.=20
The similarity in the patterns of transmission during the 1978 and 1992
epidemics suggests that extensive use of the Great Lakes and connecting
rivers for transportation and domestic purposes may be the reason for the
explosive cholera outbreaks that occur sporadically in this region. =20
