[After many months of no WPV1 AFP cases confirmed in Afghanistan, 2 cases have been confirmed during the past week, a reminder that in areas of civil unrest, "silent" transmission of the WPV1 may go undetected for prolonged periods. Clearly, transmission of WPV1 is markedly reduced during 2021 when compared with 2020, but is this truly a function of improved vaccination coverages, or is this a function of reduced reporting in Afghanistan combined with a post-epidemic period? Time will tell.

With respect to cVDPV2, Nigeria continues to have multiple states involved with ongoing transmission and Yemen reporting newly confirmed cVDPV2 AFP cases, having reported cases of cVDPV1 earlier in the year (2021). Looking at the year-to-date reported cases, the 2021 reported total is 68% of the year-to-date total in 2020. With respect to cVDPV cases, during 2021 to date, 26 countries have reported evidence of transmission (2 with only positive ESs); during 2020 there were 25 countries reporting evidence of transmission of cVDPV.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen; and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]

[Looking at the picture over the preceding 11 weeks, one sees the addition of another country in the European region (Ukraine) identifying cVDPV2, and a new country in Africa, Guinea-Bissau. Looking at each individual week's report can be deceiving, as some weeks appear "very quiet" only to be followed by very active weeks. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Statement of the 30th meeting of the IHR on polio - WHO

Statement of the 30th Polio IHR Emergency Committee
---------------------------
The 30th meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) on the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the WHO director-general on 3 Nov 2021 with committee members and advisers attending via video conference, supported by the WHO secretariat. The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV). Technical updates were received about the situation in the following state parties: Afghanistan, China, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, Nigeria, Pakistan, Senegal, and Ukraine.

Wild poliovirus
WPV1 transmission has fallen to low levels, with no new case since January 2021, when 2 WPV1 cases occurred, 1 each from Pakistan and Afghanistan, compared to 129 WPV1 cases during the same time period in 2020. From environmental surveillance, the overall proportion of specimens that are positive in Pakistan is 10% compared to 56% in 2020, and there have been only 7 positive samples since April 2021, meaning the proportion of positives for the last 6 months is 2.2%. During last 3 months, only 1 environmental sample has tested positive for WPV1 from the 163 assessed samples (from DI Khan in August [2021]). September 2021 was the 1st month since environmental surveillance started in Pakistan in which all of the assessed environmental samples tested negative for WPV1. From the samples processed to date in October [2021], no sample has been found positive. The committee also noted the completion of the surveillance review in Pakistan, which found a high likelihood that the current WPV1 detection is valid.

The key challenge in Pakistan remains the 'persistently missed children' in the core reservoirs, regarding which progress is being made through innovative approaches such as deploying evening vaccination teams, health camps, tracking of missed and not available children after the SIA is completed, dealing with refusals before the campaign starts, and using pro-vaccination influencers. The key challenge in Afghanistan remains the cumulative backlog of unvaccinated children due to extended inaccessibility for insecurity reasons, and the current instability and humanitarian situation causing uncertainty about programme implementation. The planned NIDs in November and December [2021] using a house-to-house campaign strategy are a key opportunity to address this large pool of unvaccinated children. Based on the progress achieved to date, the Committee noted the cautious optimism of the polio program and that the coming few months would be critical ones in interrupting polio transmission in the 2 remaining endemic countries. There is no room for complacency; close monitoring will be required to ensure that each and every child is vaccinated.

Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV)
Since the last meeting, 3 additional countries have been infected with cVDPV2, bringing the total number of currently cVDPV2-infected countries to 30, in 3 WHO Regions (African, Eastern Mediterranean, and European). The number of cVDPV2 cases in 2021 totals 420, of which 266 have occurred in Nigeria. The 3 newly infected countries were all the result of international spread of cVDPV2, namely Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, and Ukraine. Based on analysis of genetic linkages between viruses, cross-border spread remains common with 10 documented importations into 10 countries in the 2nd quarter of 2021. Despite the ongoing decline in the number of cases and lineages circulating, the risk of international spread of cVDPV2 remains high, with experience in Egypt and Iran showing that even countries with high IPV [inactivated poliovirus vaccine] coverage are at risk of established cVDPV2 transmission following importation.

The committee noted that SAGE has endorsed the transition of nOPV2 [novel oral polio vaccine type 2] from initial to wider use under EUL, based on the findings of an independent safety and genetic stability assessment. The committee also noted the pandemic-induced shortage of nOPV2 vaccine and underlined the SAGE recommendation concerning the importance of timely, quality outbreak response with the immediately available type-2 vaccine (mOPV2).

Conclusion
Although heartened by the apparent progress, the Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The Committee recognizes the concerns regarding the lengthy duration of the polio PHEIC but concluded that there are still significant risks despite apparent progress made in the 2 endemic countries, and that the coming 3 months would be a critical period to monitor the situation there closely. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:

Ongoing risk of WPV1 international spread:
Based on the following factors, the risk of international spread of WPV1 appears to continue:
- the unpredictable situation in Afghanistan, with looming humanitarian crises including food insecurity and risk of financial collapse disrupting eradication activities;
- the large pool of unvaccinated 'zero dose' children in formerly inaccessible areas in many provinces of Afghanistan ,which represents a major risk of re-introduction of WPV1 in those communities;
- high-risk mobile populations in Pakistan such as migrants, nomads, displaced populations, particularly Afghan refugees represent a specific risk of international spread;
- the ongoing risk posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have unpredictable adverse impacts on polio surveillance and on immunization activities, particularly during the northern hemisphere winter months.

Ongoing risk of cVDPV2 international spread:
Based on the following factors, the risk of international spread of cVDPV2 appears to remain high:
- the actual 10 documented instances cross-border spread into 10 countries of which 3 are newly infected countries;
- the explosive outbreak of cVDPV2 in Nigeria, which has caused international spread to neighbouring countries;
- the ever-widening gap in population intestinal mucosal immunity in young children since the withdrawal of OPV2 in 2016;
- the same factors regarding the COVID-19 pandemic as mentioned above;
- the large population of zero-dose children in Afghanistan that appears to be driving transmission there.

Other factors include
- weak routine immunization: Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by various humanitarian emergencies including COVID-19, and the number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses a growing risk, leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to outbreaks of polio;
- lack of access: Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with cVDPV, i.e., Nigeria, Niger, and Somalia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.
