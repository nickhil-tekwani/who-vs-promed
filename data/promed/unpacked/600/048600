Several cases of salmonellosis have been linked to South Australian alfalfa sprout products, prompting state authorities to issue a health warning. SA Health's chief medical officer Professor Paddy Phillips said there have been 21 recent confirmed cases of salmonellosis in people who have eaten SA Sprouts alfalfa sprouts.

"We are advising anyone who has purchased the recalled SA Sprouts alfalfa sprouts products to return them to the place of purchase for a refund, or throw them away," Professor Phillips said. "We also want to alert cafes and restaurants to check their suppliers and not serve any SA Sprouts alfalfa sprout products until further notice."

Professor Phillips said the source of the _Salmonella_ was identified through a joint investigation between SA Health, local government and Primary Industries and Regions SA. "We are working closely with the producer and suppliers while we continue to investigate," Professor Phillips said.

[The following is a good review of sprouts-associated outbreaks in the USA:

Dechet AM, Herman KM, Chen Parker C, et al: Outbreaks caused by sprouts, United States, 1998-2010: lessons learned and solutions needed. Foodborne Pathog Dis. 2014 ;11(8):635-44.

Abstract
--------
"After a series of outbreaks associated with sprouts in the mid-1990s, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published guidelines in 1999 for sprouts producers to reduce the risk of contamination. The recommendations included treating seeds with an antimicrobial agent such as calcium hypochlorite solution and testing spent irrigation water for pathogens. From 1998 through 2010, 33 outbreaks from seed and bean sprouts were documented in the United States, affecting 1330 reported persons; 28 outbreaks were caused by _Salmonella_, 4 by Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_, and 1 by _Listeria_. In 15 of the 18 outbreaks with information available, growers had not followed key FDA guidelines. In 3 outbreaks, however, the implicated sprouts were produced by firms that appeared to have implemented key FDA guidelines. Although seed chlorination, if consistently applied, reduces pathogen burden on sprouts, it does not eliminate the risk of human infection. Further seed and sprouts disinfection technologies, some recently developed, will be needed to enhance sprouts safety and reduce human disease. Improved seed production practices could also decrease pathogen burden but, because seeds are a globally distributed commodity, will require international cooperation." - Mod.LL
