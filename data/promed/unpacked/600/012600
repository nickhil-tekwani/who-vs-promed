Summary
--------
Globally, there was continued influenza activity in the Southern hemisphere, with an increase in Oceania, a peaking of activity in temperate South America and a decrease in activity in South Africa.

In the Northern Hemisphere countries, respiratory virus activity remained low in general, and influenza activity continued at low, inter-seasonal levels. Influenza type A predominated in sporadic detections. A number of countries have also scaled down surveillance activity during the inter-seasonal period.

In Eastern Africa, in countries with reported influenza activity, influenza type A predominated. In Western Africa, influenza activity decreased overall, with influenza B predominating in Ghana and influenza A in Cote d'Ivoire.

In tropical countries of the Americas, Central America and the Caribbean, influenza activity remained at low levels, with the exception of Cuba, where high levels of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) were reported, associated with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and RSV viruses detections.

In tropical Asia, countries in Southern Asia and South East Asia reported an overall low influenza activity though India reported a minor increase in activity with predominantly A(H1N1)pdm09. Influenza activity was still high in southern China with influenza A(H3N2) predominating.

In temperate South America, ILI and SARI activity remained low and continued to decrease in general, except in Chile, where respiratory virus activity remained elevated. Influenza type A viruses predominated in the region.

In South Africa, influenza activity decreased, with influenza type B predominating in recent weeks.

In Australia, influenza activity seemed to be still increasing with predominantly influenza B virus followed by influenza A(H3N2) detections.

In New Zealand, influenza activity may have peaked in the 2nd week of August 2015 with influenza A(H3N2) and B predominating.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 77 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the period from 10 Aug 2015 to 23 Aug 2015 (data as of 7 Sep 2015 14:18:56 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 32 226 specimens during that time. 4246 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 3219 (75.8 percent) were typed as influenza A and 1027 (24.2 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 326 (12.2 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 2350 (87.8 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 126 (92 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 11 (8 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
---------------------------------
Influenza activity remained at low, inter-seasonal levels in the countries of the northern hemisphere. Many countries have reduced or ceased reporting during this inter-seasonal period.

Countries in the tropical zone
---------------------------
Tropical countries of Central America, the Caribbean and South America.

The Caribbean, Central America and Andean Sub-region countries reported low or decreasing influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity during the period of this report, with the exception of Cuba, which reported continued high levels of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), due to influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09 activity and RSV.

African tropical region

In East Africa, few countries have been reporting influenza activity. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the most commonly detected virus in Mozambique, and a few influenza A detections were reported from Zambia.

Western African countries reported decreasing levels of influenza activity, with influenza B (Yamagata lineage) viruses predominating in Ghana and influenza A viruses in Cote d'Ivoire. Of the countries reporting data from Middle Africa, Cameroon continued to report low detections of influenza A viruses in recent weeks.

Tropical Asia
--------------
Southern Asia reported overall low or decreased levels of influenza activity during this reporting period.

India reported a small increase in activity, with predominantly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and also type B in recent weeks. In Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of China, influenza activity remained low.

Southern China continued to report elevated circulating levels of influenza A(H3N2) with low levels of influenza type B co-circulation.

South East Asia reported overall low or decreased influenza activity in recent weeks, although the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Thailand and Singapore reported small increases in influenza positivity rates with mainly influenza A(H3N2) viruses detected.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------

Temperate South America

In temperate South America, ILI and SARI activity remained low and continued to decrease in general, except in Chile. Overall, influenza activity so far this season has been mild with respect to previous seasons. Influenza type A predominated, with A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) co-circulating.

In Chile, influenza and RSV activity remained increased at moderate levels, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominating. Though SARI and ICU admissions were increased, the levels remained less than in previous seasons.

Southern Africa

South Africa continued to report decreased influenza activity in recent weeks. Influenza B was predominant with A(H3N2) co-circulating this reporting period.

Oceania, Melanesia and Polynesia
--------------------------------
Australia reported a continuous increase of influenza activity with varying activity across the country during this reporting period. Influenza type B (Yamagata lineage) viruses predominated with co-circulation of mainly influenza A(H3N2). The seasonal influenza vaccines appeared to be a good match for circulating strains. However, about 1/4th of the influenza B viruses tested are due to a lineage not contained in the recommended Trivalent Influenza Vaccine, more so in Queensland and New South Wales.

In New Zealand, influenza activity may have peaked in the 2nd week of August 2015 with influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses predominating. ILI activity remained above the average epidemic curve, and SARI case reports continued to increase as well.

Both French Polynesia and the Pacific Islands reported variable ILI activity with increasing trend in Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, New Caledonia, Tokelau, Tonga and Vanuatu. Fiji reported all the 8 positive cases (influenza B) detected in the 3rd week of August 2015.

Source of data
-------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System), FluID (epidemiological data reported by national focal points), and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.
