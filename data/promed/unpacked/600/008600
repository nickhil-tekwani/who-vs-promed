An outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) will lock 4 districts out of
the Central Province agricultural show next month.
The provincial director of veterinary services, Dr Dominic Wambugu, said
the disease had broken out in Kiambu, Thika, Kirinyaga and parts of
Murang'a. Consequently, the Agricultural Society of Kenya can only expect
animals from Nyeri, Maragua and Nyandarua districts. This year, some 20
head of cattle, 36 goats, 36 pigs and 16 rabbits from Nyeri District have
been confirmed for the exhibition. This is the second year the show will be
held at the new grounds after it was relocated from the Ruring'u Grounds.

[This report of an outbreak of FMD is important, but fails to indicate the
species of animal(s) involved in the outbreak. This outbreak appears to be
geographically separate from the Rift Valley outbreak cited above.
Additional information would be helpful. - Mods.TG/ES
