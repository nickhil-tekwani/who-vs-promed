[1] South Carolina (Charleston): bat, canine and human exposures

Health officials are recommending a West Ashley [Charleston, South Carolina] family to receive post-exposure treatment for rabies after their 9-week old puppy got hold of a bat that later tested positive for the disease.

According to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control [DHEC], the puppy was spotted by its owner carrying a bat in its mouth on [10 Oct 2014]. The owner, along with another family member, removed the bat from the puppy's mouth with their bare hands and had it submitted to DHEC for testing. The results on the bat came back positive for rabies on [14 Oct 2014].

DHEC officials have recommended that the 2 people who came in contact with the bat undergo post-exposure treatment, while the puppy, who was too young to have been vaccinated, must undergo a 180-day quarantine.

There were 124 confirmed cases of animal rabies during 2013 in South Carolina. There have been 116 confirmed cases in animals statewide this year [2014], according to DHEC.

A 6-month quarantine struck me as possibly a bit long, so I checked with an experienced veterinary public health colleague in Texas. See item [2] below. - Mod.MHJ]

The 180 days comes from the NASPHV [National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians] Rabies Compendium, which is a guideline and not a law.

Texas law says isolate and confine for 90 days with vaccination during the confinement. The wording is below. Obviously, euthanasia is an option, and not out of the question given the close contact between the pup and the bat. However, if they want to try to keep the pup, the Texas protocol seems to be valid. Caution: this does not guarantee the pup will not become rabid. However, it should become symptomatic during the confinement.

Texas Administrative Code, Zoonosis Control
Rule 169.30: Disposition of Domestic Animals Exposed to Rabies
----------------------------------------------------------------------
a. Not currently vaccinated animals that have been bitten by, directly exposed by physical contact with, or directly exposed to the fresh tissues of a rabid animal shall be:
1. euthanatized; or
2. immediately vaccinated against rabies, placed in confinement for 90 days, and given booster vaccinations during the 3rd and 8th weeks of confinement. For young animals, additional vaccinations may be necessary to ensure that the animal receives at least 2 vaccinations at or after the age prescribed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the vaccine administered.

b. Currently vaccinated animals that have been bitten by, directly exposed by physical contact with, or directly exposed to the fresh tissues of a rabid animal shall be:
1. euthanatized; or
2. immediately given a booster rabies vaccination and placed in confinement for 45 days.

c. These provisions apply only to domestic animals for which a USDA-licensed rabies vaccine is available.

d. In situations where none of the requirements of this section are applicable, the recommendations contained in the latest edition of the publication titled Compendium of Animal Rabies Prevention and Control, published by the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians, should be followed. The administration of a rabies vaccine in a species for which no licensed vaccine is available is at the discretion of the veterinarian; however, an animal receiving a rabies vaccine under these conditions will not be considered to be vaccinated against rabies virus in potential rabies exposure situations.

[Obviously there is pressure to put the pup down as 6-months quarantine is not cheap. But once the pup is of an age to be vaccinated, it could be, best twice, and sit out the 90 days. But it is the SCDHEC's call. - Mod.MHJ

The age that puppies get their first rabies vaccination varies by state law, and is generally between 12 weeks to 6 months of age (http://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2013/04/29/early-rabies-vaccination.aspx). - Mod.ML
