----------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no confusion over the reporting by Dr Rendell of "perennial ryegrass toxicosis" (PRGT) in the beef heifers (usually referred to as 'ryegrass staggers', but PRGT is now the preferred term as the implications of this condition are broader than just staggers). PRGT is common in this high winter rainfall area of Australia, more so in sheep than in cattle. It is more severe in certain years when seasonal conditions cause perennial ryegrass plants to become more stressed (remembering that the endophyte, and the alkaloids that they produce, have a useful role in protecting the plant). Severe PRGT often occurs when we get good summer rains (typically thunderstorms), or early autumn rains (the 'autumn break'). This causes the ryegrass plants to start growing, but then heat (in summer) or drier conditions (lack of follow up rains in autumn) arrests this early growth. The fungal endophyte which produces the alkaloids that cause PRGT is concentrated in stems (rather than leaves), so the condition occurs when plants are short and animals graze close to the ground (that is, there is a lower leaf to stem ratio). Older stands of perennial ryegrass (typically referred to as 'Victorian perennial ryegrass') carry high levels of toxic endophytes, whereas newer varieties of perennial ryegrass have been developed with 'safer' (less toxic) endophytes on board (the 'novel' endophytes provide some advantages of protection against pests, but have lower levels of toxic lolitrems (stagger-inducing) and/or ergovaline (cause hyperthermia) alkaloids).

In contrast, annual ryegrass toxicity (ARGT) occurs in drier areas where annual ryegrass is present. This is typically in those areas where cereal crops are grown, and the occurrence of ARGT tends to be confined to well-known areas (or even paddocks) within this zone. In contrast to PRGT, ARGT is a lethal disease with the epidemiology you describe. However, there is no (or very little) annual ryegrass in the area of western Victoria where the cases of PRGT in cattle were reported.
