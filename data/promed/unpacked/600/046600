CYCLOSPORA: DEFINITION
======================
[In response to a request for a definition of this emerging disease - Mod.JW]
Date: Tue, 18 Jun 1996 20:02:45 -0400
From: Drzero@aol.com
The following I have taken from Medline using their abstract search engine.
It is not a strict definition, but it is defined in a couple of these
abstracts.
The first may be the most useful since it is about the first reported
outbreak in the US and discusses pathology and symptoms.
The second discusses the group of pathogenic spore-forming protozoa.
The third discusses a possible PCR assay.
Abstracts source Medline, which has an access point on AOL (America OnLine).

Cyclospora in patients with traveller's diarrhea.
Abstract: Following the description in 1986 of a new enteropathogen called
Cyanobacteria-like body (CLB), several outbreaks caused by this
microorganism have been described. Since then several research teams have
agreed to place CLB in the genus Cyclospora and to establish the
epidemiological, pathogenical and clinical features of the illness. This
paper describes and assesses those features in 20 travellers diagnosed with
CLB and reviews the main literature concerning this enteropathogen. CLB was
found in 2.8% of all cases of traveller's diarrhea in our series.
The first reported outbreak of diarrheal illness associated with Cyclospora
in the United States.
Abstract:
---------
OBJECTIVE: To investigate and characterize the epidemiology of a diarrheal
outbreak associated with a potentially new pathogen, Cyclospora species
(previously referred to as Cyanobacteria [blue-green algae]-like bodies).
DESIGN: Three retrospective cohort studies supported by laboratory
studies, environmental investigation, and community surveillance.
SETTING: A hospital in Chicago.
PARTICIPANTS: Housestaff physicians and hospital administrative staff.
MEASUREMENTS: Identification of clinical features associated with illness
and potential risks for acquisition of infection.
RESULTS: Illness was characterized by watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping,
decreased appetite, and low-grade fever. Symptoms typically occurred in a
distinctive cycle of remissions and exacerbations lasting up to several
weeks. Stool cultures and examinations for known ova and parasites were
negative. Microscopic examination of stool specimens from 11 ill persons
showed many spherical bodies, 8 to 10 microns in diameter, that were
identified as Cyclospora organisms. The organisms disappeared by 9 weeks
after onset of illness in the 7 patients from whom follow-up specimens were
obtained.
Epidemiologic studies implicated tap water from a physicians' dormitory as
the most likely source of the outbreak. Environmental investigation
suggested that stagnant water in a storage tank may have contaminated the
water supply after a pump failure.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported outbreak of diarrhea associated with
Cyclospora in the United States. Cyclospora may be a human enteric pathogen
able to produce bouts of acute and relapsing diarrhea, and it should be
considered in assessments of patients with unexplained, prolonged diarrheal
illness.

Understanding intestinal spore-forming protozoa:
cryptosporidia, microsporidia, isospora, and cyclospora.
Abstract:
---------
OBJECTIVES: To summarize recent information about the "new" gastrointestinal
protozoal pathogens (cryptosporidia, microsporidia, isospora, and
cyclospora) and to help practicing clinicians integrate this information
into their clinical databases by emphasizing the similarities among these
organisms.
DATA SOURCES: Relevant English-language articles published between 1988 and
1995 were identified through a MEDLINE search done using the names of the
intestinal spore-forming protozoa. Articles cited in the bibliographies of
these and other articles were searched manually.
STUDY SELECTION: Studies that contained information on the history,
taxonomy, life cycle, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations,
diagnosis, and treatment of the pathogens were reviewed.
DATA EXTRACTION: Cryptosporidium parvum, Isospora belli, Cyclospora
cayetanensis, Enterocytozoon bieneusi, and Septata intestinalis are
intestinal spore-forming protozoa that cause intracellular infections,
predominantly in the epithelial cells of the intestine. They are transmitted
either by stool from person to person or through contaminated water or food
by an infectious particle called a spore or oocyst. Asymptomatic infections
occur; the most common symptom of infection is diarrhea. Infections have
been associated with intestinal inflammation, disordered architecture (such
as villus blunting), and abnormal function (for example, malabsorption).
Mild to moderate, self-limited diarrhea is common in healthy persons, but
patients with immune dysfunction can have severe intestinal injury and
prolonged diarrhea. Diagnosis is made by a microscopic examination of the
stool and the use of appropriate staining techniques. Effective antibiotic
treatment for prolonged infection in immunocompromised patients is available
for most of these infections.
CONCLUSIONS: The intestinal spore-forming protozoa are four frequently
identified gastrointestinal pathogens that have important similarities in
epidemiology, disease pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and
treatment.

Molecular phylogenetic analysis of Cyclospora, the human intestinal
pathogen, suggests that it is closely related to Eimeria species.
Abstract:
---------
A coccidian organism assigned to the genus Cyclospora has been increasingly
recognized in association with prolonged diarrhea in humans throughout the
world. Confusion surrounds the taxonomy of this fastidious organism, despite
the availability of morphology and sporulation characteristics.
The small subunit rRNA coding region from cyclosporan oocysts purified from
a human fecal specimen was amplified and sequenced. The same sequence was
present in specimens from 8 other patients with cyclosporan oocysts but
absent in specimens from asymptomatic subjects and from cryptosporidiosis
patients.
Phylogenetic analysis of rDNA sequences reveals that the human-associated
Cyclospora is closely related to members of the Eimeria genus. These results
allow predictions concerning Cyclospora host specificity, life cycle, and
epidemiology as well as the development of a specific polymerase chain
reaction-based diagnostic assay.
