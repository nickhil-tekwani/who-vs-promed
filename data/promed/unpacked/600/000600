Traces of anthrax have been found in a mailroom at the U.S. House of
Representatives.
------------------------------------------------------
Evidence of the bacteria was found in an area that processes mail for
lawmakers at the Ford House Office Building. It was found on only one mail
sorting machine. No other traces of anthrax were found in the building,
which is about 3 blocks from the U.S. Capitol. It marks the third
discovery of anthrax in separate facilities on Capitol Hill. The anthrax
traces were found in a mailroom area where letters for the offices of both
House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) and House Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt (D-Mo.) are sorted. The Capitol Hill physician, Dr. John Eisold,
said mail workers will be tested for anthrax exposure.
Strains Appear Identical
Federal authorities have revealed that the anthrax found in Daschle's office
came from the same strain as that contained in a letter sent to NBC News
headquarters in Manhattan, and one mailed to American Media Inc., a tabloid
publishing company in Boca Raton, Fla. Tom Ridge, director of the Office of
Homeland Security, has referred to them as "indistinguishable." Officials
also said the strains do not appear to have been "weaponized," noting that
they are not resistant to antibiotics commonly used to treat anthrax.
[I am well informed that the strain associated with the recoveries in
Florida, New York and Washington is 'Ames'. - Mod.MHJ

2nd New Jersey postal worker tests positive for anthrax
----------------------------------------------------
A second New Jersey postal worker has tested positive for cutaneous (skin)
anthrax as investigators work to track down the source of the bacteria. The
latest confirmed cases are a female New York Post editorial assistant who
tested positive for cutaneous anthrax, and a man who works at a mail
distribution center in New Jersey who tested positive for the same
condition. The man sorts mail at the Hamilton Township distribution center,
which handled the anthrax-tainted letters sent to NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw
and Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle.
Both the West Trenton, New Jersey, post office where the infected letter
carrier worked, and the area's main mail processing and distribution center
were closed Friday as investigators scoured the buildings for clues to the
origin of the anthrax
Latest developments
- Director of Homeland Security Tom Ridge had said federal officials had
identified the site from which some letters carrying anthrax came. But FBI
Special Agent Linda Vizi in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, said the FBI has not
pinpointed a single mailbox, nor a single source of the anthrax.

FBI questions residents along New Jersey mail route
---------------------------------------------------
FBI agents have been combing the streets of this Trenton suburb, knocking
on doors and swabbing for residue along the route of a mail carrier who now
has the skin form of
anthrax.
Tests results were pending on a third postal employee, a maintenance
employee who worked on mail-sorting machines at the Hamilton facility.
Postal officials have said they believe he has the disease. The post office
where the infected letter carrier worked feeds mail to the Hamilton
facility. Both were closed Friday, and health officials told employees to
their physicians and begin a seven-day course of antibiotics.
Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge said the FBI has been able to identify
a New Jersey mailbox where the anthrax-tainted letters had been. FBI Special
Agent Sandra Carroll said Ridge was referring to a mail sorting box, not an
outdoor mailbox.

Facts often obscured in uncertainty of anthrax scare
----------------------------------------------------
[This article describes the problems that have arisen with the accuracy of
reporting when politicians "share the stage" with health scientists. -
Mod.ES
Key quotes include:
"Maybe people who don't have the information are answering questions they
shouldn't be answering," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National
Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He is one of several health
experts who have taken a more public role over the past several days.
Amid confusing statements, public health authorities realized they had to
speak up, said Tom Milne, executive director of the National Association of
County and City Health Officials. "They quickly learned that the political
sources of information don't always have the facts, from Tommy Thompson
right down to the newest mayor," he said.
It's all given many Americans the jitters. [And others. - MHJ
While there have been just 8 cases of anthrax infection in the entire
country, more than half of Americans say they are at least somewhat worried
that they or someone they know very well might be a victim of an anthrax
attack, according to an ABC-Washington Post poll. Almost two-thirds said
they are at least somewhat worried about the situation of attacks with
anthrax letters. "Our biggest problem today is not anthrax. Our biggest
problem is fear," said CBS anchor Dan Rather, whose assistant is one of the
victims.
[Byline: Laura Meckler
[The next time around senior politicians and their appointee equivalents
should be barred from announcing results, which should be left to the fully
informed. Also I am amazed that the FBI, CDC, and state public health
departments did not set up appropriate websites with full information, but
left it to intermediary journalists, good & bad, to be their messengers. -

Subject: Ames strain
I got this today from the Iowa State Alumni Assn:
** ISU NEWS FLASH - October 19, 2001**
A service to members of the Iowa State University Alumni Association.
DEBUNKING THE AMES ANTHRAX STORY
The false story spread as fast as a flu bug in a daycare center: The FBI
had traced the origin of the anthrax that killed a Florida man to a bacteria
that had been manufactured and harvested in a laboratory in Ames, Iowa.
Eighty phone calls and seven TV interviews later, ISU Veterinary Medicine
faculty finally got the word out: Wrong!
Here's the story: A strain, which originated from an Iowa cow, was
identified in 1980 at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory and was
shipped for further research to the US Army Medical Research Lab in
Frederick, Md., where it was named the "Ames strain." ISU's Veterinary
Medicine College did not conduct research on the strain, nor did they
maintain the culture.
The story got muddled a bit, because of the presence of another strain of
anthrax, which had been dried, preserved, and stored at the college for
historic reasons. Isolated in 1925 and sealed in 1928, the bacteria were part
of a culture created by ISU veterinary medicine professor, Ival A. Merchant.
Custody of the cultures was handed down through the generations of ISU
microbiologists who followed, with a goal of opening the sealed tubes for
testing in the year 2028, 100 years after their sealing.
But the specimens weren't really needed for teaching or research, and the
FBI and Centers for Disease Control had no interest in the old samples.
Following a day of around-the-clock guarding by the Iowa highway patrol,
college administrators decided to destroy the historic anthrax. On 12 Oct
[2001,
the specimens were burned, in the presence of a patrol officer.
