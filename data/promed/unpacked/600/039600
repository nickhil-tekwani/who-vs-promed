CODA isolates the bluetongue virus
-----------------------------------------
The Belgian Research Centre for Veterinary Medicine and Agrochemistry
(CODA) has successfully isolated the virus responsible for the bluetongue
disease outbreak in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. The CODA results
have already been confirmed by the French reference laboratory AFSSA.
The isolation is an important step in the efforts to study the virus in
detail; the laboratory-grown virus variant can be used for virus
neutralization.

[Virus isolation should enable the awaited identification of the BTV
serotype involved. The neutralization tests are type specific for the
currently recognized 24 BTV serotypes and can be used to serotype a virus
isolate. For details, see chapter 2.1.9 "Bluetongue" in OIE's Manual of
Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00032.htm>.
Serotyping will enable the selection of the appropriate vaccine. - Mod.AS]
