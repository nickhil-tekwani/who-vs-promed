Last year [2014], the number of patients with diseases transmitted by wild rodents more than tripled compared to previous years. This included hantavirus infections, with 36 patients instead of the usual annual average of 13. The National Institute for Public Health and Environment, the RIVM, and the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority, the NVWA, announced this on Tuesday [3 Nov 2015].

Hantavirus [infections] can cause symptoms ranging from flu like symptoms to serious kidney problems. The strain of hantavirus prevalent in the Netherlands is the Puumula virus, which is transmitted by bank voles and field mice. In humans, the Puumula virus can cause fever and renal failure.

According to the 2 organizations, the cause of the increase in rodent transmitted diseases is not entirely clear, but the mild winter and hot summer likely played a role. The organizations are not too worried about the situation, because the number of patients is limited.

[Puumala virus (PUUV) is endemic across central and northwestern Europe, including the Netherlands. PUUV outbreaks are related to increases in bank vole populations. The vole population increases are due in large part to increases in beech tree mast (tree seeds) abundance, with PUUV outbreaks occurring a year after peak mast production. The mild winter may have increased overwinter survival of these rodents as well. The rodent hosts are widely distributed across Europe.
