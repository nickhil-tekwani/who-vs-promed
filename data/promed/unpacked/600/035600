Bird flu discovered at U.S. farm that ships chickens to New York City
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOVER, Del. (AP) - Delaware state officials ordered the destruction of some
12,000 chickens Friday on a farm that ships the birds to New York City
after confirming the flock has been infected by avian influenza.
"We don't want this to spread," Delaware Agriculture Secretary Michael
Scuse said at a hastily arranged news conference Friday evening.
"We're trying to protect an industry that is very important."
Scuse would not disclose the location of the infected chicken houses or the
identity of the grower, saying only it is an independent operation in
southern Kent County that sold to the live bird market in New York.
"We don't want a lot of traffic around this location," he said.
Scuse said the strain of avian influenza is different from the one that has
spread to the human population in Asia and there is no threat to human health.
Nevertheless, the strain, known as H7, is one of the most virulent types of
the virus and has the potential to cause severe economic damage if it
spreads to the commercial broiler industry, a linchpin of the region's
agricultural economy.
"We're trying to nip this thing in the bud," said William Satterfield,
executive director of Delmarva Poultry Industry Inc., an industry trade group.
Avian influenza is an airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among
animals through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure.
Satterfield advised commercial poultry growers in the region not to allow
visitors on their farms and chicken houses.
"We just need the growers to be a bit more vigilant," he said.
"If this gets into the commercial chicken industry, we could have a severe
situation."
The infected flock will be destroyed with carbon monoxide and composted
inside the two chicken houses were they have been raised. Testing will
begin Saturday morning of flocks on 12 commercial farms within a
three-kilometre radius, Scuse said.
Results of the testing should be known within hours, said state
veterinarian Wesley Towers.
State officials learned of the problem Thursday after the grower contacted
a representative of Elanco Animal Health, in Salisbury, Md. Elanco
veterinarian Robert Evans and Mariano Salem of the University of Delaware's
poultry diagnostic lab visited the farm Thursday afternoon.
"We found a lot of morbidity," said Salem, adding two samples tested
positive for avian influenza Thursday afternoon.
Further testing Friday was followed by a meeting of the DPI Emergency
Poultry Disease Task Force.
"Less than 24 hours after we had run the samples, a lot of decisions were
made," Salem said.
Towers said the New York live bird market has had a problem with avian
influenza for some time. Delaware agriculture officials speculate the virus
was carried to Delaware on unclean bird crates or perhaps chicken manure on
a person's shoes.
Towers said he visited the New York market with the Delaware grower last
fall to advise him about the precautions he needed to take.
"We tried to tell him that there was a problem up there and that he ought
to be careful," he said.
"We tried to warn him."

little of a potential threat to humans. Mod.- DK]
