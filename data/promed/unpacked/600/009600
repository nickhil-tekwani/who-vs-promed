Illegal meat trade sparks health fears
--------------------------------------
Customs officers say high meat prices in Switzerland are
fuelling a lucrative cross-border smuggling trade which
poses a danger to public health.
The authorities, who have intercepted 5 metric tons of
smuggled meat in the past 18 months, say the racket is
increasingly being run by organised gangs.
Since the introduction of import quotas a decade ago, the
Federal Customs Office says it has seen an upsurge in the
amount of meat smuggled into Switzerland from neighbouring
countries, where prices are up to 50 per cent cheaper.
And it is not simply a question of a few sausages slipped
under the front seat. Smuggling operations are often
professionally run and involve shipments worth tens of
thousands of francs.
According to Serge Gumy, head of criminal investigations
at the Federal Customs Office, a combination of high meat
prices, stiff customs duty, increased traffic and relaxing
of border checks have created "a big risk of fraud" in
Switzerland.
"There is an enormous market here for smuggled meat, and
it's principally down to the price difference between
Switzerland and abroad," he told Swissinfo. A kilo of beef
filet costs around SFr70 (USD57) in Switzerland.
"You only have to look at the number of big cases we are
dealing with to see how much things have increased in
recent years."
Massive fraud
-------------
In one of the biggest cases, which is still going through
the courts, customs officers exposed a 20-strong
trafficking network responsible for the illegal import of
600 metric tons of beef, pork and horsemeat over a
two-year period. The unpaid duty amounted to around
SFr12.5 million (USD10.2 million).
Fines totalling SFr900 000 (USD73 440) have already been handed out and
prosecutors are seeking a one-year prison sentence for the ringleaders.
The meat, which was mainly of South American origin, was
bought in Belgium and France and stashed in a hidden
compartment on an articulated lorry. On arrival in
Switzerland, the contraband was sold to butchers and
restaurants.
In another case in 2003, investigators smashed a smuggling operation in
Basel involving around 10 metric tons of beef, veal and pork worth SFr400
000 (USD326 400). The meat was sold to restaurants in Zurich and Basel.
And it is not just butchered meat that is coming to light. The racket also
extends to livestock such as piglets and horses.
Health risks
------------
But it is not simply a question of financial fraud; there
is also the issue of health risks to consider.
The Customs Office says much of the smuggled meat is
transported in poor hygienic conditions. Most of the time
there is no accompanying health and safety certificate,
and the meat is unrefrigerated.
The Federal Veterinary Office, which checks and authorises
meat entering Switzerland, says smuggled meat poses a
serious risk to the health of animals and humans.
Spokesman Marcel Falk said smugglers tended to have little
expertise in handling meat which was often already
decaying by the time it arrived in Switzerland. This
raised the possibility of consignments being riddled with
bacteria such as salmonella or campylobacter.
"There is also the risk of infecting animals with highly
transmissible diseases," added Falk. "If you have an
outbreak of foot and mouth, swine fever or avian flu the
consequences would be dramatic in terms of animal
suffering and economic losses."
To combat the increase in trafficking, the Customs Office
underwent a reorganisation 7 years ago to place more
onus on intelligence gathering and analysis.
With around 21 000 trucks crossing into Switzerland each day and 1 882km of
frontier to patrol, the country's 4500 customs officers have had to develop
a more targeted response. Now each investigation section has a special unit
whose job is to collect and sift through all the information coming in from
phone tip-offs, emails, letters, police, government agencies, cantons and
abroad.

[I checked with an authority in Switzerland because of the slight anomalies
in the volumes quoted, and the 600 metric ton legal case is outside the
total for the past 18 months, as it relates to the immediate period before
and the legal process. These are not trivial volumes of meat. We can assume
that equivalent volumes are entering other European countries. It is a very
significant health risk. - Mod.MHJ]

Illegal food import seizures rise
---------------------------------
Seizures of illegal food imports at Northern Ireland airports have
risen sharply, government figures have shown. More than 2600 kg of
meat, fish and vegetables were seized last year [2004], a 35 percent
rise over the previous year.
Jonathan Guy, a vet with the Department of Agriculture, said diseases
from illegal food imports could threaten crops, livestock and public
health. He said the foot-and-mouth outbreak of 2001 was probably
caused by illegally imported products being fed to pigs. Mr. Guy
said: "No one needs [to be] reminded of the impact which foot and
mouth disease had on all walks of life here in 2001. It is estimated
that the outbreak cost the Northern Ireland economy some GBP 24
million [USD 44 million]. After an infected animal, contaminated food
waste is the next most likely cause of an epizootic disease
outbreak." The current legislation makes it illegal to bring back
meat and milk-based products for personal use into Northern Ireland
from countries outside the EU.
However, consignments of illegal food imports from more than 80
non-EU countries have been seized at Belfast International Airport
and Belfast City Airport since 1998, according to the department.
Inspectors said there had even been instances of maggot-infested
produce being concealed in suitcases.
Mr. Guy said the reasons why there was a high risk of disease coming
into Northern Ireland were 3-fold: the trend towards more exotic
travel destinations, an increasing flow of EU and non-EU migrant
workers into the province and the enlargement of the European Union.
"As well as the obvious risk to the Northern Ireland animal
population, there are serious public health risks associated with
eating unfit products," he said.
As well as foot-and-mouth, other diseases threaten animal health,
such as swine fever and avian flu. To try to decrease the risk of
infection, the department has placed strict restrictions on
foodstuffs that can be brought back from countries outside Northern
Ireland.
Mr. Guy said: "Anyone intending to make a trip, whether for business
or pleasure reasons, should check the rules on food imports before
they leave the UK. If you are caught breaking the rules, then you may
face long delays, prosecution and a fine."

[By the nature of this trade being illegal -- and it is widely agreed that
only a small proportion of such materials are stopped at borders -- we can
assume that the participants include not just ethically challenged
businessmen but also criminal organizations. The risks are extremely
significant. - Mod.MHJ]
