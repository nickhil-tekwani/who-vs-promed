Crops over 3500 acres wiped out due to disease
----------------------------------------------
A mysterious crop disease has forced fruit and vegetable growers of
Gadap and Bin Qasim towns to destroy orchards spread over around 3500
acres [approx 1400 ha].

Abdul Rashid Memon, Malir Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association
(MFVGA), said that growers have had to clean and torch papaya orchards
to prevent the disease from spreading. He said that later on, the
growers found that the same disease had affected vegetables and
destroyed cash crops, adding that the total loss should total millions
of rupees.

Memon said that most growers have not witnessed this particular crop
disease ever before. He said that they first observed the disease some
3 months ago in papaya trees, and subsequently informed the government
department officials concerned. Gadap Town Municipal Officer (TMO) Gul
Hassan Kalmati said the growers in Gadap usually cultivate vegetables
and small areas of cash crops, which have been affected by the
diseases as the pesticide they receive is ineffective.

The fertile area of Gadap and Bin Qasim has a long history of
producing fruits and vegetables. About 85 percent of the families of
the area are fully dependent on agriculture and livestock.

[It is unlikely that the same disease would affect such a diverse
range of crops. While a number of plant pathogens do have a wide host
range, it is more likely that more than one crop disease is affecting
the area. This would also explain the ineffectiveness of the supplied
'pesticide', but insect pests could be involved as well.
