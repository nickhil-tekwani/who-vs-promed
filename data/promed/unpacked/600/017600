Mystery surrounds bird deaths
-----------------------------
Galahs dropping dead and falling from trees in Oxley Park remain a
mystery but the possibility of poisoning seems unlikely following a
necropsy by a veterinarian.

The vet from Central West Livestock Health and Pest Authority (LHPA)
is investigating the deaths of a large number of birds that were found
dead under trees throughout the park on Sunday morning [15 May 2011].
Some were also seen in the grounds of TAFE [technical and further
education]. The birds did not have any obvious injuries or wounds and
were all lying in a spread wing position. Some of the birds will now
be sent off to the Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute at
Menangle for further testing in case any exotic, notifiable disease is
the culprit.

Senior LHPA ranger based in Dubbo Lisa Thomas said the bird deaths
were a concern, with a necropsy carried out by the vet, who retrieved
some of the birds that had been retrieved from the scene on Sunday
morning. The vet found no evidence of poisoning by mouse baits and no
dye discolouration in the crops or stomachs of the birds.

The LHPA works in conjunction with landholders to protect crops from
mice but the management includes prevention of poisoning of non-target
animals, such as grain-eating birds.

"Perimeter baits are brightly coloured which are not attractive to
birds, and the grey-coloured grain used on broadacre crops is applied
later in the evening after birds have gone in to roost," Ms Thomas
said.

Warren Shire Council and National Parks and Wildlife were also
contacted regarding the deaths.

[Galahs (_Eolophus roseicapilla_) is also known as the Rose-breasted
Cockatoo.

TAFE is the largest vocational education and training provider in
Australia, and perhaps one of the best in the world.

It is very odd that only one species would be affected. If it were a
toxic situation then one might expect other species to be involved.
The same could be said for disease; it would likely affect more than
one species.

A thorough necropsy and testing will hopefully provide a diagnosis.
In the meantime, I wonder what the weather was doing? Sudden storms
can trigger irregular flights and birds crashing into things and
falling.

We look forward to the results of the necropsy. - Mod.TG
