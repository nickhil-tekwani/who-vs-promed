Avian influenza: first easing of restrictions in the Netherlands
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health today agreed to
reauthorise as of 18 Jun 2003 the export of live poultry and hatching eggs
from certain parts of the Netherlands, provided no further outbreaks or
suspicions are recorded. Restrictions remain in place for the 5 provinces
with surveillance zones. No further decisions were taken for Belgium and
Germany.
The Netherlands
Since the start of the avian influenza epidemic in the Netherlands on 28
Feb 2003, no live poultry, hatching eggs and fresh, unprocessed poultry
manure or litter may be exported to other member states or third countries
and, with some derogations, no live poultry and hatching eggs may be
transported within the Netherlands. The derogations apply to day-old
chicks, pullets, and poultry for immediate slaughter. As no new outbreaks
have been confirmed in the Netherlands since early May, the Standing
Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health voted today unanimously in
favour of a European Commission proposal to limit these restrictions to
certain provinces of the Netherlands as of 18 Jun: Flevoland, Gelderland,
Limburg, Noord-Brabant, and Utrecht.
Belgium and Germany
As agreed in the Committee meeting of 28 May, the restrictions still
applicable in the provinces of Antwerp and Limburg have expired on 11 Jun
2003. They now only apply in the surveillance zones (10 km zones around the
outbreaks). In Germany the restrictive measures will continue to apply in
the part of North Rhine-Westphalia west of the Rhine until 24 Jun 2003.
From 25 June onwards they will only apply in the surveillance zone
established around the single outbreak that had been recorded in Germany.
