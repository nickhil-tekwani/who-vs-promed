An independent panel of veterinary scientists headed by Prof. Ian Kennedy
of University College, London, has been set up by the UK Government to
investigate whether keeping imported cats, dogs and other pets in
quarantine for six months should be replaced by other methods, allowing
freer movement of pets to and from Britain. It will report later this year.
However, seven of the panel members have signed a letter in the latest
issue of Veterinary Record, official journal of the British Veterinary
Association, which was quoted in this story as saying, "We are concerned
that virtually all the attention has focused on rabies. Discontinuation of
the quarantine system concerns many other health issues other than rabies
and the public, policy makers and media should be alerted to this to ensure
that it is included in the debate."
Among the dangers cited in the story were:
Leishmaniasis, a disease spread by several species of sandfly which affects
dogs, cats and people and causes dum-dum fever and sores. Up to half of
dogs in parts of Greece are believed to be affected and nearly 20 per cent
of dogs in southern Spain and parts of Italy.
Heartworm, or dirofilariosis, which attacks the heart, kidneys and urinary
tract of dogs and cats. Spread by mosquitoes and gnats, symptoms include
weak legs, breathing difficulties, loss of weight and coughing. About 44
per cent of dogs in the Po Valley of Italy are affected and 33 per cent in
the Salamanca area of Spain.
Babesiosis, a tick-borne disease, common in many parts of mainland Europe,
which destroys red blood cells and can kill within a week unless treated
promptly. [The latter is similar to red-water fever in cattle. Survivors
remain poorly for years afterwards. Different strains attack dogs, cats,
cattle, sheep and horses.
Ehrlichiosis, spread by ticks, attacks dogs and people, causing fever,
muscle pains and gastroenteritis. A strain that attacks horses causes
abortions in mares.
_Echinococcus granulosus_ and _E. multilocularis_, two strains of tapeworm
which attack dogs, foxes and people and are common in countries bordering
the Mediterranean and in central Europe.

[Unfortunately the latest Vet Record in our library is for Dec 6th, so I
had to use the Electronic Telegraph website to recall the newspaper report,
which is much as Bob gives it above.
A number of things struck me immediately:
[1 However, the letter writers are not on Prof. Ian Kennedy's Committee as
suggested by the above account. A careful reading of the article indicates
that the seven are concerned "Veterinary scientists at Edinburgh
University's centre for tropical veterinary medicine at Roslin,
Midlothian". The standard UK protocol for Government Committees is that all
members maintain a discrete and proper silence until after the report is
submitted to the Minister and published.
[2 An quick reading of the letter would wonder at why there were concerns
as two of the quoted infections (Lieshmania & Heartworm) may not have
vectors in the UK, and all in all it would not take long for the BVA or
RCVS to issue the necessary clinical diagnostic guides. The anecdotal
histories quoted - "The vets said that harmful ticks found normally in
southern Europe had spread already to Sweden since it removed its
quarantine controls; Italian hunting dogs were suspected. "Increasing dog
movements will also increase the risk of introducing ticks," they said;
"in Britain, deadly ticks from Brittany have been found on dogs and people
in Hull after hitching a ride in a car of returning holidaymakers who had
left their own dog at home." - were designed more for attention-getting
than enlightenment.
[3 However, the letter writers - Archie Hunter, Alan Walker, Keith
Sumption, Martyn Edelsten, Gordon Scott, Morley Sewell and Alex Morrow -
include a number of well respected individuals, some of whom I have known
for many years and whose opinions I willing to listen to. One would
presume that they have submitted their concerns to the committee, and
having done so feel free to make public their views.
Obviously, there is more going in this matter on than meets the eye. Maybe
one of the above gentlemen may wish to enlighten us with data. - Mod.MHJ
