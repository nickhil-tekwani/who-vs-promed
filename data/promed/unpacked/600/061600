A disease affecting some mule deer in the Yavapai Hills community and surrounding areas near Prescott [Yavapai county] has been confirmed by the Arizona Game and Fish Department.

After receiving reports in recent weeks from residents who observed deer that appeared to be lethargic, blind, walking in circles, and unaware of their surroundings, Game and Fish biologists collected tissue samples from 3 animals and sent them to a laboratory for testing, according to a news release.

The results confirmed the presence of epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) in all 3 deer, as well as bluetongue in 1 of the 3 animals.

These viruses affect only animals, primarily deer but also pronghorn, bighorn sheep, domestic sheep, and cattle, Game and Fish officials reported [Fri 14 Sep 2018].

"We detected these viruses in sick deer last year [2017] in Prescott Valley and around Kingman," said Anne Justice-Allen, the department's wildlife veterinarian. "We know these viruses have been present in Arizona because we can find antibodies in the blood of wildlife."

The viruses are spread by _Culicoides_ midges, commonly known as "no-see-ums," Game and Fish officials said. The midge populations dramatically increase as the result of summer monsoon precipitation.

"Generally, we don't see any significant disease because most of the susceptible wildlife have some immunity to the infection. It could be that we are seeing more this year [2018] because of several years of drought, meaning the animals were not exposed and did not develop immunity." Justice-Allen added that the intense monsoon this summer has caused a bloom of the midges, exposing native animals and leading to the disease.

A resident of Yavapai Hills, said he has witnessed the deer in question. "They do not behave normally," "As a hunter, you can tell when there's just something wrong with an animal." He said a deer's natural "escape" behavior is not present in the sick deer.

Calls to the Arizona Department of Agriculture livestock inspector, to see if EHD has been seen in local sheep or cattle, went unreturned before press time.

Game and Fish officials and local veterinarians were unavailable for comments, concerning treatment for EHD and mortality rates.

A Weather Service report states that drier conditions are ahead for Yavapai county, along with cooler temperatures, and the midges will be decreasing significantly.

[Hemorrhagic disease (HD), caused by viruses in either the epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) or bluetongue virus (BTV) groups (Reoviridae: _Orbivirus_), is the most important viral disease affecting white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) and mule deer (_O. hemionus_) in the United States. In North America there are 3 subtypes of EHD virus (EHDV 1, 2, and 6) and 5 subtypes of BT virus (BTV 2, 10, 11, 13, and 17). Isolated cases BT viruses from infected deer were first reported in 1968, although white-tailed deer mortalities consistent with EHD/BT disease were noted as early as 1886. - Mod.PMB
