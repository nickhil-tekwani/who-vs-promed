It has now been confirmed that the encephalitis outbreak in New York City
and suburban areas is being caused by West Nile virus (WNV). Virus
isolates from brain tissues of humans who died of the illness have been
identified as WNV or Kunjin virus.
Whereas WNV is closely related genetically and antigenically to St. Louis
encephalitis virus (SLEV), which at first was thought to be the etiologic
agent of these illnesses, WNV is even more closely related to Kunjin virus,
found only in Australia. There are some who consider Kunjin vius simply a
recombinant West Nile virus-other flavivirus. Indeed, when the Rumanian
WNV isolates were sequenced at C.D.C. in 1996, they were thought for a time
to be Kunjin viruses; that's how close they are. Additional sequencing of
isolates from the current outbreak should provide evidence for the origin
of these viruses. It has not yet been determined whether all 14 people in
NY City and Westchester County who were diagnosed with encephalitis were
infected with WNV but it is clear that at least some were. Additional
tests should provide further information as to the etiologies of all these
illnesses.
W. Ian Lipkin, Director of the Emerging Diseases Laboratory at the
University of California at Irvine, said his colleagues had identified the
virus in the brains of three victims from Queens [County, NY City that had
been sent to his lab last week.
Until Saturday, New York health officials said they had found WNV only in
birds that had died in and around the Bronx Zoo. But this morning, after
the C.D.C confirmed the discovery of the virus in humans, a state official
acknowledged that officials had known about the findings of Dr. Lipkin and
Dr. Gubler [C.D.C. Fort Collins, Colorado for several days, but wanted to
conduct more tests.
John Signor, a [New York State Health Department spokesman, said the
agency was planning to release the information tomorrow after more testing
confirmed the earlier findings. "The identification of a virus is a complex
process," he said. "We felt more testing needed to be done."
Despite the discovery that the encephalitis outbreak had been caused by a
virus different from SLE virus, officials said that the public health
measures undertaken to date would not change: the spraying of mosquitoes
and warnings to reduce exposure to the insects remains. Mr. Signor said
that the treatment for those already infected with the disease also would
remain the same.
On Friday, the C.D.C. had said that its scientists had identified a West
Nile-like virus in four birds from New York that they had tested in their
laboratory in Fort Collins. The birds included two flamingos and an Asian
pheasant from the Bronx Zoo, and a crow reported to be from Scarsdale [a
Westchester County suburb of NY City , said Kristine Smith, a spokeswoman
for the New York State Health Department.
On Saturday, city health officials continued collecting dead birds, which
they had started to do on Friday. Special telephone lines and asked
residents to call in sightings of dead birds. By 4 P.M. on Saturday, the
City Health Department had received two dozen reports of dead birds in all
five boroughs, and sent out staff members from its pest control division to
retrieve specimens, said a spokeswoman, Sandra Mullen.
"The birds will be kept on dry ice and brought to our Bureau of
Laboratories," she said, adding that most of the dead birds reported were
crows, which have been dying in large numbers since the beginning of the
outbreak.
Health officials in Suffolk County [eastern Long Island collected five
dead crows on Friday, and sent them for analysis to the State Department of
Environmental Conservation on Saturday, said the director of public health,
Mahfouz Zaki.
And after receiving reports at 5:30 P.M. on Friday that earlier samples
from dead crows tested positive for [WNV, they sprayed South Huntington
and Huntington Station with pesticides.
In Manhattan, a team from the Parks Department swept through Central Park
on Friday night searching for dead birds but found none, said Parks
Commissioner Henry J. Stern. He said that more teams would be dispatched,
but that all park staff members had been notified and were on the lookout.
Though the symptoms of both diseases are similar, and the steps to combat
them are the same, the mosquitoes that carry them can differ, health
officials said. Ms. Smith of the State Health Department said the
mosquitoes that carry SLEV and WNV, _Culex pipiens_, are generally active
from dusk to dawn but that another type of mosquito known to carry WNV,
_Aedes vexans_, is also active during the day.

[According to Dan Sudia, a C.D.C. retiree who worked with Roy Chamberlain,
Don Stamm, and Bob Kissling, many years ago, crows might have been
surveyed, along with other wild birds, for antibody to eastern equine
encephalitis virus but no experimental studies (SLEV viremias) were done
with crows. He went on to say that they inoculated house sparrows (_Passer
domesticus_), red-winged blackbirds (_Agelaius phoeniceus_), cowbirds
(_Molothrus ater_), and pigeons (rock dove = domestic pigeon, _Columa
livia_) with SLEV and that resulting viremias were very low but sufficient
to infect mosquitoes. For the reference see: Chamberlain RW, R Kissling, D
Stamm, and WD Sudia, Virus of St. Louis encephalitis in three species of
wild birds, Am J Hyg 65, 1957. There having been no data (that I know of)
in the literature regarding crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_, the American
crow, or _Corvus ossifragus_, the fish crow)
Ticks also can transmit WNV, so it will be important to surevy ticks in the
near and distant future in order to assess the possibility that WNV is
becoming (or has already become) enzootic in the NY area. Infected ticks
on migrating birds, perhaps some blown off course by recent hurricanes,
could have brought WNV into the NY area.
Farida Mahmood (Mosquito Research and Control, Rutgers, the State
University of New Jersey) asks whether consideration has been given to to
the transovarial transmission of WNV by _Culex pipiens_ and suggests that
NY authorities not overlook the possible resurgence of the disease in
spring by diapausing female progeny of the the mosquito species involved in
transmission. We are certain that C.D.C. will be looking into this and
other possibilities for persistence next year and in the years to come.
Given the bird die-offs in NY City, Westchester County, Suffolk County, and
Connecticut, there may be recent and continuous spread of WNV in the area.
An alternative is that someone is now looking and that this has been going
on for some time, weeks, months, or years.
