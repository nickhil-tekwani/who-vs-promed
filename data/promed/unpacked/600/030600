Tomatoes (_Lycopersicon esculentum_), an important cash crop for smallholder
farmers in the hillside production systems of the Valles crucenos, Santa
Cruz Province and Rio Chico, Sucre Province, Bolivia, were surveyed during
2002-3.
Symptoms of hoja de perejil start with adventitious sprouting of axillary
buds and rapid elongation of side shoots, which break through the crown of
normal leaves. Leaves of the side shoots are small and fern-like and as the
season progresses large bushy plants are produced. Flowers are reduced in
size and do not appear to set fruit, but some fruit may be produced on the
early normal growth. Infected plants were screened for virus using lateral
flow kits (Pocket Diagnostics), ELISA and electron microscopy. Only Tomato
mosaic virus was identified, but this was not consistently associated with
hoja de perejil.
DNA was extracted from affected plants and tested by nested PCR for
phytoplasma using generic rDNA primers P1 (Deng & Hiruki, 1991) / P7
(Schneider et al., 1995) and R16F2n/R16R2 (Gundersen & Lee, 1996).
Phytoplasma products were confirmed using the endonucleases HaeIII, RsaI and
AluI, and by direct sequencing of the 16S/23S spacer region (SR) with P4
(Smart et al., 1996) / P7 primers.
During the tomato crop surveys, plants of _Calotropis_ sp. (Asclepiadaceae),
a vine growing in hedgerows, were found around affected tomato fields near
San Rafael, Santa Cruz Province, that showed symptoms of little-leaf.
DNA was extracted from these plants and indexed for phytoplasma as above.
Amplimers (1250 bp) with identical RFLP profiles were consistently obtained
from hoja de perejil and _Calotropis_ plants with little-leaf. SR sequences
from hoja de perejil (GenBank Accession No. AY725208) and Calotropis little
leaf (No. AY725207) were compared with those of other phytoplasmas in
GenBank using BLAST. They showed a maximum (91 percent) homology with
phytoplasmas from the 16SrI Aster yellows group.
This is the 1st report of hoja de perejil disease of tomato, where infection
rates of over 60 percent were seen in some fields of the most popular
cultivar 'Rio Grande'. This is also the first report of Calotropis little
leaf disease and its association with a phytoplasma.
The BLAST results suggest that the phytoplasma found associated with these
diseases may belong to a new 16Sr phytoplasma group.

[The gist of this piece is that a possibly new 16Sr phytoplasma subgroup has
emerged in the tomato cv 'Rio Grande' and in _Morrenia variegata_ [Mv] in
the Bolivian provinces of Santa Cruz and Sucre. An infection rate of 60
percent suggests that the disease may be widespread in some areas, but there
are no data on crop loss in tomato. Obviously the phytoplasma is well-
established in Mv in affected areas of Bolivia and constitutes a source of
inoculum.
Incidentally, I could not find Mv among several data bases, only _M.
odorata_ (latex plant). Perhaps our colleagues can provide the correct
species name.
