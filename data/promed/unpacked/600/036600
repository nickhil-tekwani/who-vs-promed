The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS), Division of Public Health (DPH) is currently investigating an outbreak of bloodstream infections caused by elizabethkingia. The majority of patients acquiring this infection are over the age of 65, and all patients have a history of at least one underlying serious illness. At this time, the source of these infections is unknown and the Department is working diligently to contain this outbreak.

As part of the outbreak investigation activities, DPH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are conducting site visits and collecting environmental samples from both private residences and health care facilities. CDC is also assisting Wisconsin with testing of samples from a variety of potential sources, including health care products, water sources and the environment. To date, none of these have been found to be a source of the bacteria.

The Department has alerted health care providers, infection preventionists and laboratories statewide and provided information as well as treatment guidance for this outbreak. After that initial guidance was sent, there has been a rapid identification of cases and healthcare providers have been able to treat and improve outcomes for patients.

Elizabethkingia infections believed to be associated with this outbreak reported to DPH*:

Case counts between 1 Nov 2015 and 23 Mar 2016
---------------------------
Confirmed / 52
Under investigation / 3
Possible cases** / 4
---------------------------
Total cases reported to Wisconsin DPH / 59

*This investigation is ongoing. Case counts may change as additional illnesses are identified and more cases are laboratory confirmed.
**These are cases that tested positive for elizabethkingia, but will never be confirmed as the same strain of _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ because the specimens are no longer available to test.

Affected counties include Columbia, Dane, Dodge, Fond du Lac, Jefferson, Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Racine, Sauk, Sheboygan, Washington, Waukesha, and Winnebago.

[More cases have been added to this list in Wisconsin with at least one of the cases in a newly reported county, Winnebago. No new cases have been reported in Michigan, which has one confirmed case, or in any other states.

Winnebago county is the northernmost county to be affected. It is due north of Fond du Lac county and can be seen on a map of the state's counties at http://wisconsindot.gov/PublishingImages/travel/road/hwy-maps/counties.gif. With Winnebago and Sheboygan counties being the newest on the list, it may be the case that the cluster is moving northward. - Mod.LL
