A computer programmer has been jailed for 8 years for trying to buy deadly ricin poison from the Dark Web, after being inspired by the hit US television series Breaking Bad.

The programmer, 31, was found guilty last month [August 2015] of attempting to possess a chemical weapon between 10 Jan and 12 Feb 2015.

Sentencing of the perpetrator at the Old Bailey, Mr Justice Saunders told him that having a chemical weapon was "much more serious that possessing a firearm." He said: "It seems to me that this is the sort of case where a deterrent sentence has to be passed. Everyone needs to know that the possession of a chemical weapon is extremely serious and long prison sentences will follow." The perpetrator and purchaser were jailed at the Old Bailey.

The judge commended law enforcement agencies in Britain and the United States for ensuring that ricin -- known as the perfect poison for leaving no trace -- did not get into the purchaser's possession.

He told the court: "I am satisfied so that I am sure the ricin purchaser had no intention of disposing of the ricin immediately.

"He intended to keep it. That created a real risk that at some stage in the future he might decide to experiment with it or that it could fall into the wrong hands."

The ricin purchaser, who was diagnosed with mild Asperger's or autistic traits, stood impassively in the dock as he was sentenced.

A woman in the public gallery who is believed to be a family member wailed loudly as he was sent down. Earlier in mitigating, Joel Bennathan QC said: "The man has a large supportive family who care for him.

"They are distraught and appalled by the mess he has got into. When he is released, he will be supervised and will be occupied in order to make a living and looked after by his family."

Under the username "Weirdos 0000," the purchasers struck a deal with a supplier on the Internet black market to buy 500 mg of powder for 500 US dollars (GBP 320), enough to kill 1400 people.

This man was unaware that his source Psychochem was in fact an FBI agent, who tipped off police in England and substituted the consignment of ricin for harmless powder.

After the father of 2 took delivery of a toy car with 5 vials hidden in the battery compartment, police swooped to arrest him at his home in Prescot Road, Liverpool.

Under ultraviolet light, the man's face lit up showing that he had handled the package, which had been specially treated with a marker substance. The man, was covered in invisible liquid when he handled the ricin that was tested under UV light as part of the sting.

Computer analysis showed that the purchasers 1st began trawling the internet for information on poisons such as abrin, ricin and cyanide in October last year (2014).

The court heard the man approached the undercover agent in January [2015] with a private message: "Hi, would you be able to make me some ricin and send it to the UK?"

In a series of encrypted chats, they discussed the price of a lethal dose, discounts for bulk orders and repeat purchases, and ricin's "shelf life," jurors were told.

At one point, the man purchasing the ricin asked: "How do I test this ricin?" and received the instruction: "You must test it on a rodent."

Records showed that on 4 Feb 2015 -- days before the delivery -- he made a payment of 21 849 Bitcoins, the online currency.

Around this time, this man had made a to-do list on his computer, which included the entries "paid ricin guy" and "get pet to murder," the court heard. He had also made a series of internet searches for chinchillas, animal rescue centres, rabbits and "pocket-sized pets."

In his defense, the purchaser told jurors that he was just "curious" and wanted to test the boundaries of the Dark Web, unaware that ricin was illegal.

He said: "I found lots of different items ranging from drugs, guns, other illegal items, and because I had been watching the Breaking Bad TV show, I just had ricin in my mind."

Afterwards, Detective Chief Superintendent Tony Mole of the North West Counter Terrorism Unit, said: "Ali attempted to buy a deadly poison, and we can only speculate on what he planned to use it for, but in any case such as this, we take swift and decisive action. Thanks to the vigilance of officers from a number of different law enforcement agencies, we were able to intervene before this man did get hold of such a deadly substance from a genuine seller. I want to reassure our communities that the North West Counter Terrorism Unit and local police are well aware of the potential dangers associated with internet activity on the 'dark web.'"

[The television series Breaking Bad has spawned a number of "copy cat" acts, either trying to purchase, or use, or test ricin. What a triumph that this extremely dangerous substance was taken out of circulation before any harm could be done.

Ricin is a product of the castor bean plant. There is no law against having castor bean plants. They are beautiful, hearty plants. However, if a pet ingests a seed, and cracks it, the pet faces a potentially lethal outcome, especially without immediate emergency care.

It should be noted that castor *oil* has no ricin in it.

"Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans. If castor beans are chewed and swallowed, the released ricin can cause injury. Ricin can be made from the waste material left over from processing castor beans. It is a potent protein derived from the beans of the castor plant (_Ricinus communis_). Castor beans are used in the production of castor oil, a brake and hydraulic fluid constituent [and laxative. - Mod.JW]. The aqueous phase of the process, termed the "waste mash," is 5-10 percent ricin. Ricin works by getting inside the cells of a person's body and preventing the cells from making the proteins they need, hence, it is often called a toxalbumin. Without the proteins, cells die. Eventually this is harmful to the whole body, and death may occur.

"Ricin can be in the form of a powder, a mist, or a pellet, or it can be dissolved in water or weak acid. It is a stable substance under normal conditions, but can be inactivated by heat above 80 C [176 F].

"Ricin has been used experimentally in medicine to kill cancer cells.

"Effects of ricin poisoning depend on whether ricin was inhaled, ingested, or injected. The major symptoms of ricin poisoning depend on the route of exposure and the dose received, though many organs may be affected in severe cases. Initial symptoms of ricin poisoning by inhalation may occur within 8 hours of exposure. Following ingestion of ricin, initial symptoms typically occur in less than 6 hours.

"Inhalation: within a few hours of inhaling significant amounts of ricin, the likely symptoms would be respiratory distress (difficulty breathing), fever, cough, nausea, and tightness in the chest. Heavy sweating may follow as well as fluid is building up in the lungs (pulmonary edema). This would make breathing even more difficult, and the skin might turn blue. Excess fluid in the lungs would be diagnosed by x-ray or by listening to the chest with a stethoscope. Finally, low blood pressure and respiratory failure may occur, leading to death. In cases of known exposure to ricin, people having respiratory symptoms that started within 12 hours of inhaling ricin should seek medical care.

"Ingestion: if someone swallows a significant amount of ricin, he or she would develop vomiting and diarrhea that may become bloody. Severe dehydration may be the result, followed by low blood pressure. Other signs or symptoms may include hallucinations, seizures, and blood in the urine. Within several days, the person's liver, spleen, and kidneys might stop working, and the person could die.

"Skin and eye exposure: ricin is unlikely to be absorbed through normal skin. Contact with ricin powders or products may cause redness and pain of the skin and the eyes.

"Death from ricin poisoning could take place within 36 to 72 hours of exposure, depending on the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or injection) and the dose received.

"In suspected situations where ricin may have been disseminated, preliminary environmental testing by public health or law enforcement authorities may detect ricin in powders or materials released into the immediate environment. Persons occupying such areas may initially be observed for signs of ricin poisoning.

"No widely available, reliable medical test exists to confirm that a person has been exposed to ricin.

"Because no antidote exists for ricin, the most important factor is avoiding ricin exposure in the 1st place. If exposure cannot be avoided, the most important factor is then getting the ricin off or out of the body as quickly as possible.

"Symptomatic ricin poisoning is treated by giving victims supportive medical care to minimize the effects of the poisoning. The types of supportive medical care would depend on several factors, such as the route by which victims were poisoned (that is, whether poisoning was by inhalation, ingestion, or skin or eye exposure). Care could include such measures as helping victims breathe, giving them intravenous fluids (fluids given through a needle inserted into a vein), giving them medications to treat conditions such as seizures and low blood pressure, flushing their stomachs with activated charcoal (if the ricin has been very recently ingested), or washing out their eyes with water if their eyes are irritated."
