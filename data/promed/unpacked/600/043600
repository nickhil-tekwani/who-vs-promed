WA officially free of the disease apple scab
--------------------------------------------
Western Australia is now one of the few regions in the world to be
officially free of the disease apple scab. The disease was discovered in a
Perth Hills orchard 3 years ago, and since that time the apple industry has
spend half a million dollars on a state-wide eradication project. Apple
scab leaves blemishes and cracks on apples, which reduces yield and makes
the fruit unsaleable.

Tony Portman, development officer with the Department of Agriculture and
Food, says its eradication project has been laborious but very successful.
"Over 340 000 trees have been inspected. There's over a million trees in
the state. So 30 per cent of the trees have actually been inspected." Mr
Portman says that one of the main bonuses is that growers won't have to
control the disease. "In the Western world most growers lose about 5 per
cent of their crop each year from apple scab."

Angelo Loguidice from WA's Apple and Pear Council says money that has been
spent on eradicating the disease can now be directed towards better
marketing campaigns for apples.

[Apple scab, also called black spot, is caused by the fungus _Venturia
inaequalis_ and is considered the most economically important disease of
apples worldwide. Infected fruit is often unmarketable and harvest losses
can be more than 70 per cent if favourable weather conditions prevail. The
pathogen infects only species of _Malus_, while other fungi in the same
genus are known to cause scab diseases on different hosts, including pears
and nashi fruit. Leaf symptoms include dark spots, and severe infections
may cause the leaves to fall prematurely. On fruit, lesions appear and the
skin ruptures around them revealing a dark velvety layer of spores. Older
lesions become corky in appearance. Early infections often result in large
fruit lesions and severely cracked and malformed fruit.

The fungus overwinters in infected leaves on the ground. Spores are
discharged during rainy periods and can be spread with infected plant
material, by mechanical means, and carried long distances in air currents.
Secondary infections are spread short distances mainly by splashing rain
and cause additional build-up of the disease. Early infections are most
damaging since fruit becomes more resistant as it matures, requiring
increasingly longer wet periods for infection. Disease management is
expensive requiring up to 12 fungicide sprays a year in areas where scab
has become established. Apple cultivars vary in their susceptibility to
scab. Resistant varieties are available, but few of them are currently
suitable for commercial production, and resistance breeding continues.

Apple scab is currently present in eastern Australian states. In WA,
several outbreaks of the disease have occurred since the early 1900s, but
each outbreak has been successfully eradicated. An eradication and
surveillance plan was initiated following each detection. WA's geographical
isolation with about 2100 km (1305 miles) to the nearest infected orchards
in South Australia is considered to justify the eradication efforts. As a
result, WA is the only commercial apple-growing area in the world where
apple scab has not become established, and this freedom represents
significant savings and trade advantages to the regional apple industry.
