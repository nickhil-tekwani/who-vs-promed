A jar of home-canned salmon sent an Anchorage man to the hospital with a life-threatening illness for a week this summer [2019], according to state epidemiologists.

The man ate the salmon on 19 Aug 2019 and the next day reported feeling lightheaded. His vision and speech began to blur as his face weakened, according to an epidemiology bulletin. He went to the hospital and was immediately treated for botulism.

The illness is rare but occurs with higher per-capita frequency in Alaska than in the Lower 48, said Eric Mooring, a disease detective with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The toxin that causes botulism can develop in improperly preserved foods, and symptoms appear within 18 to 36 hours. The disease causes muscle paralysis and can be deadly if left untreated.

In the Lower 48, the antitoxin cure is kept at CDC quarantine stations in large airports, and the treatment is shipped to the impacted patient. In Alaska, the antitoxin is stored at 8 hospitals across the state. Mooring said there are about a half-dozen or fewer cases of botulism in Alaska annually, and there are only a few dozen throughout the entire country.

Mooring said the sooner patients receive treatment, the better off they are. The antitoxin stops symptoms from worsening but doesn't reverse any damage that has already set in. Although the disease has the potential to be fatal, Mooring said "it's hardly a death sentence," because only 4% of patients with confirmed cases of botulism die.

The Anchorage man told investigators the fish tasted and smelled bad. He caught the salmon around 20 Jul 2019 and canned it 5 days later, the bulletin said. The man heated the fish in a slow cooker overnight and then canned it, the bulletin said.

Mooring warned that the only way to safely can low-acid foods like fish is with a pressure canner.

[Most cases of food-associated botulism are related to home preserved food as here. Of note, the man ate the fish despite it tasting and smelling bad.

Most marine food associated cases are due to type E. - Mod.LL
