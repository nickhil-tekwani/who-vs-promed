The report of the Manila Times, 17 Nov 1999, it's a common occurrence in
developing countries. The emphasis put on human passive and active
immunization (not vaccine) surprises me; human rabies, as any other
zoonotic disease, is prevented by vaccinating the vector, dogs in the
Philippines. As far as I have heard, the cost of vaccine for 20 800 dogs is
approximately US$50 000 at the present price per dose. The PHO(Provincial
Health Office) should compare this amount with the financial amount (Ps)
needed for human vaccine and antirabies globulin. Furthermore, dog rabies
control programs have been successfully applied in developing countries (1,
2) with dog populations much larger than the estimated by the PVO
(Provincial Veterinarian's Office) for the Province of Tarlac.

[Dr. Larghi point is well taken. Using current figures from US suppliers, I
have found prices as inexpensive in the USA as US$15 000 for rabies vaccine
for 20 800 dogs. It is much more economical to vaccinate the dogs than to
treat large numbers of people exposed to rabies. - Mod.TG
