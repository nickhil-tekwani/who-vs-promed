Influenza update 135 [3 Jun 2011]
---------------------------------
Summary
-------
- The influenza season has finished in the temperate countries of the
northern hemisphere with only sporadic influenza virus detections
occurring.

- Transmission in tropical countries of the Americas and sub-Saharan
Africa has continued to decline.

- South Africa has reported an increase in influenza virus
detections, primarily influenza A(H1N1)2009, consistent with the start
of their winter influenza season. Seasonal transmission does not
appear to have started in other temperate countries of the southern
hemisphere.

- A summary review of the northern hemisphere winter influenza season
is now available as a WER [Weekly Epidemiological Record, at
http://www.who.int/wer/2011/wer8622/en/index.html] or as an expanded
online version [at
http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/2010_2011_GIP_surveillance_seasonal_review/en/index.html].

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere

Influenza transmission in all reporting countries in the temperate
regions of the northern hemisphere has now subsided to very low,
intra-seasonal levels. Sporadic detections of influenza viruses have
been reported in many countries across the northern temperate zone but
no active community transmission has been noted

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Very little influenza activity has been reported since the last
update in tropical areas [see ProMED-mail post: Influenza (37): WHO
update 20110521.1536], though some localized transmission has been
noted.

Transmission has continued to occur in the Dominican Republic, all
influenza A(H1N1)2009, and Jamaica, primarily influenza type B with
smaller numbers of H1N1 (2009), but the numbers of cases are low and
decreasing in both countries. An unconfirmed media account has
reported that new cases of H1N1 (2009) were detected in Bolivia in
late May 2011 along with an increase in severe respiratory infections.
Many countries of the northern, tropical areas of South America report
large numbers of respiratory disease in children, including hospital
admissions for pneumonia, related to respiratory syncytial virus [see
ProMED-mail post Respiratory syncytial virus - Chile: (Santiago) 20110603.1699].

Transmission in the tropical areas of sub-Saharan Africa has largely
subsided to very low levels, including previously noted active
transmission in Kenya and Ghana. Madagascar has continued to report
small numbers of influenza type B, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza
A(H1N1) 2009. Only sporadic detections of influenza viruses have been
reported in the tropical countries of Asia.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
South America

Southern Africa

The National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa has
reported an increase in influenza viruses over the last 4 to 5 weeks
consistent with the start of the influenza season. The large majority
of viruses isolated have been influenza A(H1N1)2009 with a very small
number of influenza A(H3N2).

Australia and New Zealand and South Pacific

Oceania Melanesia and Polynesia (snapshot)

The influenza season does not appear to have started yet in either
Australia or New Zealand. Although Australia had previously noted
unusual out-of-season influenza virus transmission, rates of detection
have recently decreased and levels of influenza-like illness (ILI)
have remained low in the majority of surveillance systems reporting.
New Zealand has reported sporadic detections of influenza viruses,
primarily H1N1 (2009) and influenza B, however weekly consultation
rates for ILI have remained below baseline nationally.

Source of data
--------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide
and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on
available epidemiological and virological data sources, including
FluNet (reported by the Global Influenza Surveillance Network) and
influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States.
Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of
data available at the time when the update is developed.
