Emergency report: Translation of a fax received on 22 August 1997 from Dr
J.F. Coronado Faith, Director of Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture and
Animal Husbandry, San Jose:
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, post-mortem and laboratory
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 23 July 1997
Estimated date of first infection: 3 July 1997
Location No. of outbreaks
Canalete, Mexico and Puebla villages, Upala 5
canton, Alajuela province, near border with
Nicaragua(10o 53' 58" N - 85o 00' 58" W)
Description of affected population: backyard pigs, with phenotypical
characteristics of the swine population in the border area
Total number of animals in the outbreaks:
susceptible cases deaths destroyed slaughtered
... 7 4 ... 87
Diagnosis: the death of four adult pigs was reported in Canalete and Mexico
(Upala canton). A boar used for service in these small villages was reported
with clinical signs compatible with classical swine fever. Laboratory
examination gave positive results and the animal was slaughtered.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: National Veterinary Services
Laboratory (LANASEVE)
B. Diagnostic tests used: ELISA, direct immunofluorescence, serological
examination, avidin-biotin stain and alkaline phosphatase
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: the source was probably an
infected pig introduced from a neighboring country
B. Mode of spread: direct transmission
C. Other epidemiological details: the outbreaks occurred consecutively in
two areas (Mexico and Puebla) within a zone of 5 km=B2
Control measures during reporting period: as soon as laboratory results were
known to be positive, two technical teams were formed to conduct screening
and slaughter. The two teams are continuing their work of epidemiological
surveillance within and around the outbreaks and in an area defined as being
at risk situated along the northern border of the country.
The outbreaks have been eradicated. Screening conducted around the outbreaks
and in areas at risk has produced negative results.
