[Prior to 1981, dengue and its more severe form, dengue hemorrhagic fever
(DHF), were considered to pose little or no threat to the Americas. This
scenario changed suddenly as a result of the Cuban epidemic of 1981, the
first major DHF epidemic in the Americas. For the following 10 years,
sporadic cases of dengue and DHF were observed. Then in 1990, Venezuela
experienced the second major epidemic in the Region. These events clearly
marked dengue and DHF as an emerging disease in the Americas. There were no
registered cases of dengue in El Salvador until 1980, when the first
epidemic occurred with 2060 cases. During the following 10 years, cycles of
increasing and decreasing numbers of reported cases occurred. In 1993 and
1995, there were 9015 and 9658 reported cases, respectively, the highest
numbers of cases ever registered in El Salvador at the time. The number of
cases in 2000 surpassed the 1993 and 1995 data. This was the largest
epidemic ever registered in El Salvadors history. A case fatality rate of
9.22 percent for DHF and an incidence rate of 260.60 cases per 100 000
population
for combined dengue and DHF were calculated. Initially, the department of
Sonsonate had the highest rate, but by the end the department of San
Salvador resulted in having the highest rate of 291 cases per 100 000
inhabitants, followed by Cabanas (231 per 100 000), La Libertad (179 per
100 000), Chalatenango (137 per 100 000) and Sonsonate (135 per 100 000).
Virus isolation studies show that serotypes DEN-1, 2 and 4 were
co-circulating in the 1980s, whereas the only serotype isolated during the
2000 epidemic was DEN-2. For more detailed information see: Epidemiological
Bulletin, Vol. 21 No. 4, December 2000. - Mod.CP
