A woman from the Flagstaff area of Arizona has died from complications of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), making her the 1st case of the serious, viral disease in Coconino County in 6 years, according to a Coconino County Public Health Services District [CCPHSD] news alert [7 Jun 2013]. According to health officials, it is unclear where the woman contracted the virus.

The last reported case in Coconino County was in 2007 and the individual ultimately recovered.

Hantavirus [infection causes] a potentially life threatening disease with symptoms similar to influenza is spread to humans by rodents. Rodents, especially deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_], carry [Sin Nombre] hantavirus. The virus is found in their urine and feces, but it does not make the animal sick.

It is believed that humans can get sick with this virus if they come in contact with contaminated dust from mice nests or droppings. You may come in contact with the dust when cleaning homes, sheds, or other enclosed areas that have been empty for a long time.

"It is extremely important that the public takes precautions when entering and cleaning sheds, garages, campers, cabins, barns, and other buildings to protect themselves from HPS," said Randy Phillips, CCPHSD Environmental Services Division manager.

[Sin Nombre] hantavirus does not spread between humans.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) divides the symptoms of hantavirus between "early" and "late" symptoms. Early symptoms include fatigue, fever, and muscle aches, especially in the large muscle groups -- thighs, hips, back, and sometimes shoulders. These symptoms are universal. There may also be headaches, dizziness, chills, and abdominal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. About half of all HPS patients experience these symptoms.

At 4-10 days after the initial phase of illness, the late symptoms of HPS appear. These include coughing and shortness of breath, with the sensation of, as one survivor put it, a "tight band around my chest and a pillow over my face" as the lungs fill with fluid. HPS has a mortality rate of 38 per cent, according to CDC.

Including this case, there have been 22 confirmed hantavirus [infection] cases in Arizona since 2006, with half of them resulting in death.

[The hantavirus responsible is most likely Sin Nombre virus. Its rodent host is _Peromyscus maniculatus_ (deer mouse), which is widely distributed in North America and frequently invades houses. In addition to Sin Nombre virus, rodents are the principal hosts of 4 other hantaviruses known to cause HPS in North America. The case fatality rate for Sin Nombre virus infection is 38-40 per cent, with a higher risk of death in those patients who seek medical attention late in the course of their disease.
