As a former ribavirin investigator, I can comment on some of these
issues.
Ribavirin's efficacy, in American trials, has been less than
wondrous. I was peripherally involved in RSV trials and directly
involved in influenza trials.
With respect to RSV [respiratory syncytial virus], aerosol seemed to
have a beneficial effect by the aerosol route alone. These studies,
done by Caroline Hall et al. in the late 70s-early 80s, have been
called into question recently and many pediatricians do not have much
enthusiasm for this drug.
Insofar as the flu trials, I am on one paper in which we showed
a statistically significant benefit in flu with respect to aerosol
treatment. It has been difficult to replicate these results and I
believe that amantadine is superior for flu A and the new
neuraminidase inhibitors may be better for flu B. I, personally,
would be hesitant to use aerosol administration for this indication.
The aerosol route and aerosol generator are also difficult to use.
As an aside, I do not believe that systemic ribavirin worked in these
patients.
As to availability, ribavirin is made by Viratek, a division of ICN
(Costa Mesa, CA). ICN almost assuredly still holds the patent to this
drug. They will have to be the ones to license it for its use elsewhere.
A good resource person to talk to about this would be Karl Johnson.
He is a former Medical Director of Viratek and was involved in some
of the US trials. He is trout fishing in Montana.

Jack [Bernstein]'s comment to the effect that he does not believe that
ribavirin worked "in these patients" is perplexing because I don't know
which ones he means.
If (they were) those in Sierra Leone or China, I have no further comment
except that HE sure was not there (and I'll warrant would be screaming for
the drug were he to stick himself with Lassa). He was not a ribavirin
investigator -- but was an aerosol ribavirin investigator for treatment of
usually non-fatal respiratory disease.
As to production of drug, sources of supply, etc. I am now happily beyond
such thoughts. What is labelled as this drug is (was) produced and used in
China. I doubt Russia is making it, but their military might have (done so)
prior to the '90s.
C.J. [Peters] has the score fairly straight. And I think that intravenous
is the way to go -- especially for loading.
The oral drug should also work, if dosed properly, because fractional
uptake by this route is excellent. This has not been formally proven in
clinical trials. Aerosol for systemic HF [hemorrhagic fever] diseases
makes no sense to me. Reason for that mode was the toxicity of the systemic
drug, in context of wanting to use it in RSV disease in very young children,
where mortality was quite low without treatment, but certainly not zero.

The latter claim is not true. ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., manufacturer of
ribavirin, currently produces aerosol ribavirin for use in respiratory
syncytial virus infections. The intravenous formulation is not FDA-approved;
ICN has nevertheless produced that form of the drug and has made it available
to the CDC, NIH, WHO, the U.S. Department of the Interior, and the U.S.
military, among others, in special circumstances and on a compassionate use
basis. (Source: David Deere, Director of Marketing, ICN Pharmaceuticals,

From: name withheld by request
Contacted an individual in [FDA] Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research (CDER) ref. ribavirin. The last and only U.S. manufacturer was
ICN Pharmaceutical in California. The only Indication for Use
they were approved for was aerosolization treatment for RSV. I would
assume this indication was probably only in children. CDC has been in
active contact with CDER. It is my understanding that several options are
being pursued.

Naturally, CDER is aware of the foreign manufacturers, Russia and China.
Neither of these manufacturers has approached CDER for approval to
distribute within the U.S. Therefore, we do not have an idea of how well
the manufacturing process is controlled. Personal opinion - How a drug or
device is manufactured is important. One of things the FDA does do well,
to the consternation of many manufacturers, is place some controls on the
manufacturing process. Not all manufacturers abide by Good Manufacturing
Practices. - End personal opinion and enough said.

I realize the above is rather fragmentary. Please realize that the FDA is
bound by certain confidentiality requirements (read law). Again, the CDER
contact stated that they were in active contact with CDC (Dr. C.J.Peters)
and I am sure CDER (FDA) will do what they can to help with the Sierra
Leone situation.
