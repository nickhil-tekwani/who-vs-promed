I am working in the Agents for Public Health Program in rural
settlements in the municipality of Agua Boa, eastern Mato Grosso. A
farm near a settlement where I work in Camargo Soares has reported 8
cases of malaria [by 6 Dec 2010] for the 1st time ever in this
locality (but there were some serious but non-fatal undiagnosed fever
cases there last year [2009]).

Our city is about 200 km from the part of Mato Grosso called Amazonia
Legal and not considered to be a region of endemic malaria.

We are concerned about the advance of the disease to the settlement,
although surveillance technicians state that they have taken adequate
control measures.

There is no "official" movement of labor from any endemic area. All
the cases are working as rubber tappers in the adjacent forest, and
neither the index case nor any of the others have any history of
recent travel. All cases have been hospitalized in the nearest city.
There is frequent contact on weekends between students who study on
the farm and children in the nearby settlement.

[The latest data from the WHO, the World Malaria Report 2008
(<http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/atoz/9789241563697/en/index.html>)
shows a map of risk areas in Brazil, and the eastern part of Mato
Grosso is considered a risk area for malaria transmission. The data,
however, are more than 2 years old, and if malaria cases have not
been diagnosed in the area around Agua Boa and they now appear, there
is reason for concern, as local transmission is clearly taking place.
We do not know which species of malaria parasite has been diagnosed
or whether there have been further cases around Agua Boa. ProMED will
be happy to post further information. - Mod.EP]
