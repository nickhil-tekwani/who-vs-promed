Govt should back producers' call to ban pigmeat imports
-------------------------------------------------------
Australian Pork Limited (APL) says the Federal Government should listen to
New Zealand pork producers and ban pigmeat imports. The Federal Government
is appealing against a court order stopping the director of quarantine from
issuing permits to import pork.

APL spokesman Paul Higgins says New Zealand had an outbreak of a
pig-wasting disease in 2003, and producers have seen its effects 1st-hand.
Mr Higgins hopes the case can be sorted out as quickly as possible.
"Because we are seeing our farmers at risk, every day this continues to go
on and also we believe in having some certainty in the marketplace," he
said. "Because of the complex legal issues, the board has requested some
further advice before we make a final decision about what our strategy will
be outside of the appeal process. What they're saying [NZ producers] is
that their import patrols have got to be tightened up to stop the disease
coming in again, because they're spending millions of dollars to eradicate
this devastating disease from their shores."

Imported pork may pose biosecurity threat
-----------------------------------------
New Zealand pork producers are nervous that imported pork is jeopardising
efforts to rid this country of PMWS (post weaning multi-systemic wasting
syndrome). The disease, which was first identified in New Zealand in 2003,
has been contained through a cooperative approach between the New Zealand
Pork Industry Board and Biosecurity New Zealand.

Pork Industry Board Chairman, Chris Trengrove, said the disease is endemic
in most pork-producing countries and is devastating for affected producers,
affecting up to 30 per cent of young growing pigs, and killing a high
proportion of those affected.

It is believed that it was most likely to have been brought to New Zealand
through imported pig meat. "Bearing this in mind, we concur with Australian
Pork Ltd's action through the Australian Federal Court in which it
successfully challenged Australian government plans to allow pig meat
imports from PMWS-affected countries. The Court ordered that no more import
permits be issued, based on the risk management measures which had been
earlier adopted by the Government.

"New Zealand producers fully understand the Australians' concerns and their
desire to ensure that their national herd maintains its disease-free status
in relation to PMWS," he said.

New Zealand and Australia were almost the only pork-producing countries
which remained free of this disease after it spread around the world over
the last decade, and New Zealand's reaction to the outbreak here was to
embark on a programme to rid the country of the problem immediately and
before it became widespread. "The New Zealand Pork Industry Board is
thankful that the disease was geographically localised, and the swift
action by Biosecurity New Zealand, the industry's science advisor,
Professor Roger Morris, and the co-operation of producers enabled us to
contain the disease and ensure that the programme to stamp out PMWS was
viable," Mr Trengrove said.

He said that the Board is continuing the programme and has budgeted to
spend more than 1 million dollars, whilst Biosecurity New Zealand is also
incurring significant costs. "We are very pleased with the results of the
co-operative approach between the New Zealand Pork Industry Board and
Biosecurity New Zealand in relation to the stamping out programme, and we
hope to have it completed by early 2006," he said.

"Our major concern, of course, is that if imports continue unchecked, the
enormous effort and expense contributed by both Biosecurity New Zealand and
the New Zealand Pork Industry will be wasted and PMWS will again enter New
Zealand with the potential to devastate the New Zealand industry." Mr
Trengrove said that New Zealand had some level of protection through import
regulations requiring imports of pork from countries infected with a second
disease, PRRS, to be kept in quarantined transitional facilities with the
pork then requiring cooking before being released for sale, but the effect
of this cooking procedure on PMWS was unclear.

"The New Zealand Pork Industry Board will be asking Biosecurity New Zealand
to add these requirements to pork being imported from countries that have
PMWS, at least as an interim measure. Whilst consumers can be assured that
there are no human health or food safety issues associated with either of
these diseases, they both have the potential to wipe out our local New
Zealand industry and force the country to become reliant on imported
product, some of which may be of uncertain quality and origin," he said.

[Post weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) is not included within
the Office International des Epizooties' list of notifiable diseases, since
the etiology and epidemiology of the disease have not been clearly
established. Most researchers regard it as one of the several clinical
expressions of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) infection in swine. The others
are porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), reproductive
failure, porcine respiratory disease complex, granulomatous enteritis,
necrotizing lymphadenitis, and possibly exudative epidermitis. Association
of PCV2 with congenital tremor in piglets is still controversial. The
extent of the involvement of PCV2 in swine disease other than PMWS is
currently poorly understood.
