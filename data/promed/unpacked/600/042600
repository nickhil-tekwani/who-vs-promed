Attack of rice blast disease to the crop has become a cause of concern. [There is] an outbreak in some parts of Rajanna-Sircilla district and Karimnagar district. The paddy crop started withering and is drying up. There is every possibility of decrease in the yield of paddy. Following the fungal attack, the farmers are incurring huge losses in controlling the menace.

"I cultivated paddy in 8 acres of land and rice blast had attacked the crop in 6 acres", said a farmer. He feared that production would come down from 40 bags per acre to 25 bags per acre. Agriculture extension officers are visiting the fields. The farmers are being advised to spray fungicides during the morning and evening hours, the disease spreads very fast.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_ (previously _Magnaporthe oryzae_). It is one of the most destructive diseases of the crop worldwide, with potential yield losses of more than 50 per cent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed; infection late in the growth cycle generally leads to less severe damage. Depending on which plant parts are affected, the disease may manifest itself as leaf, collar, node or neck blast. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

The fungus also causes wheat blast (for example, see ProMED-mail posts 20170306.4883233 and 20170123.4784298). Although the pathogens are currently classified as the same species, the wheat blast pathogen is a distinct population (referred to as _P. oryzae_ Triticum population) and does not cause disease in rice.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions, including high humidity. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilizers). The fungus is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity), water and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. Use of certified clean seed is essential, farm saved seed poses a high risk of carry-over of the fungus to subsequent crops.

The fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence, including host resistance breaking strains. Environmental factors may also affect plant resistance. Both resistance and defense-regulator genes have been found to be involved in host resistance against blast (see links below) and could potentially be combined ('pyramided') to develop rice varieties with broad-spectrum host resistance against blast that cannot be as easily overcome by the fungus as varietal resistance based on single genes.
