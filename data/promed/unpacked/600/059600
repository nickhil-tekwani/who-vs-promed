Police in Katwe Kabatooro Town Council, in Kasese district, is holding 2 men who were found in possession of contaminated meat. The head of the Veterinary Department at the district, Geoffrey Kalule, says that the meat tested positive for anthrax, which poses a threat to the lives of the consumers. Kalule says the meat will be disposed of once they secure a court order.

The duo was intercepted at Katunguru roadblock while driving a vehicle to Kibara village in Mpondwe lhubiriha Town Council. According to the DPC of Kabatooro Town Council, Tyson Rutambika, the 2 were arrested with rotting carcasses of 10 cows. Rutambika told URN on Thursday [25 Jun 2020] that the meat had visible maggots and a foul smell.

He says the 2 men had also been arrested earlier for the same offence.

Rutambika noted that the suspects will be paraded before the courts to answer to counts of being in possession of unhealthy meat and suspected theft.

A section of communities in Kasese district and the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo are fond of meat that has been kept for some days, regarding it as tasty.

[Anthrax is a national problem in Uganda. During 2017-2018, there were some 236 human cases and over 1000 dead livestock (see Anthrax - Uganda (10): livestock, human, 2017-2018 20181112.6140726). For a more complete report focused on just 2018, go to https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/272668/OEW21-1925052018.pdf.

A national vaccination programme is in hand, but like all others, it does not go smoothly (see Anthrax - Uganda: (QP) cattle, human 20190503.6454247).

Kasese district, on the southwest border of Uganda with the Republic of Congo, is mainly agricultural, with over 85% of the people being peasant farmers who depend on subsistence farming for their livelihood. Most of the agricultural produce is either sold locally or transported for sale in Kampala and to other cities and towns in Uganda. Fish farming is slowly taking root in the district, and demand for the fish is high, both locally and in neighboring countries. Livestock kept in the district includes cattle, goats, pigs, and poultry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasese_District).

The report does not define the number of carcasses confirmed positive for anthrax. But one might presume that the 10 carcasses originated in the same outbreak, if only in regard to the ease of collection. And to have 10 rotting carcasses in a truck would confirm that the men had a ready market for the meat when the carcasses were butchered. If there is a local demand for meat with a foul smell and maggots, it will, unfortunately, significantly reduce any desire to inform the local veterinarians of such an acute and serious number of dead cattle. And this would have a very negative impact on the efficiency of any control and surveillance programme. Or to put it another way, it is more cost efficient to have a proactive programme that prevents such outbreaks than trying to sort it out after the event. - Mod.MHJ
