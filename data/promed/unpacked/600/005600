Angola: Marburg [virus] Cases Baffle Authorities
------------------------------------------------
The number of new cases of people infected with Marburg virus in
Angola has declined in the past few days, but the epidemic is still
not under control, the World Health Organization (WHO) is reporting.
New cases are still occurring in Uige, the same northern province
where the epidemic has been centered since it was first identified on
21 Mar 2005.
In recent weeks the disease invaded several neighborhoods that it had not
reached before, said Aphaluck Bhatiasevi, a spokeswoman in Uige for WHO. In
addition, she said, in some areas where the virus had been detected before,
new cases were seemingly inexplicable, striking people who had not been
identified as contacts of previously infected patients. The cases probably
did not mean there were new sources of infection, Ms. Bhatiasevi said; more
likely, the health workers trying to identify people who had been exposed to
the disease did not have complete information.
Within the past 2 weeks or so, for instance, there were 13 deaths in
neighborhoods with no obvious links to previous cases. "The outbreak is not
over yet," Ms. Bhatiasevi said. She said epidemiologists were investigating
the new cases, trying to determine where the victims contracted the disease.
The epidemic in Angola, thought to have begun weeks or months before
it was recognized, is the largest on record. As of yesterday, there
was a total of 376 suspected or confirmed cases in Uige, including
315 deaths. [Up from the 337 cases and 311 deaths listed by WHO for
the whole of Angola on Tue 17 May 2005. - Mod.CP] The disease is
spread by contact with body fluids like blood, saliva, or urine,
though people do not transmit the virus until they become ill. Those
who recover can still transmit the virus sexually for about 3 months.
Ms. Bhatiasevi said that because the virus had also been found in
breast milk, infected mothers were being advised not to breast-feed.
Healthy mothers of infected children were also being advised not to
breast-feed, she said, lest the mothers become infected as well.
3 patients with the disease (one child and 2 adults) were being
treated yesterday in an isolation unit operated by Doctors without
Borders[Medecins sans Frontieres] at the provincial hospital in
Uige. Though there is no specific treatment for Marburg, patients are
given supportive care like fluids and painkillers, and drugs to treat
malaria and other infections that may also be present. Dr. Pedro
Palma, a leader of the group's medical team, said: "After 8 weeks of
intervention we already have 6 patients who were discharged as
survivors. This is very good news."
The source of the outbreak in Angola is not known. Monkeys can be infected
and spread the disease to people who hunt or butcher them. [This has been
proven for Ebola but not for Marburg virus. - Mod.JW]. Bats are suspected
of being carriers, but this has not been proved.
