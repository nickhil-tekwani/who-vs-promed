National soybean rust update 22 Jul 2005
----------------------------------------
The 1st occurrence of Asian soybean rust (ASR) in Mississippi in 2005 was
reported from soybean samples collected on 13 July from a sentinel plot in
George County. 3 counties in Georgia have also reported ASR. The latest is
Decatur County (on kudzu); Tift County, reported ASR on soybean, while the
Seminole County report was on volunteer soybeans which have since been
destroyed. 8 counties in Florida have now reported soybean rust on kudzu
with 2 reports from soybean. The newest report is from soybean grown in a
sentinel plot in Escambia County near some production fields. In Alabama,
ASR has now been reported on soybeans from a sentinel plot and a commercial
soybean field. This was the 1st report from a commercial soybean field in
2005. Intensive scouting is continuing wherever soybean is grown. It is
expected that more counties in the south will report ASR over the next week
from spore deposition from prior storms.

According to XB Yang (Iowa State University) and Saitao Pan (St Louis
University), computer models show an increase in the transport of ASR
spores from known sources in the south up to northern regions, but the
higher concentration of spores being predicted is still limited to Florida,
Georgia, Alabama, southern South Carolina, and Mississippi. Our analysis of
environmental conditions using the past month's precipitation data
indicates that moisture conditions have been favorable for rust development
in the Gulf Coastal states, but not favorable in the northern production
regions because of prevailing dry conditions.
The newest soybean rust detections are within the regions our models
predicted for both high concentration of spores and favorable conditions
for disease development. For the next weeks, modeling results show
increasingly favorable conditions for rust to establish in the northern
regions of gulf coastal states, up to Kentucky and Tennessee. Conditions
are not favorable in northern states, except in southern Illinois and Missouri.
Due to the limited rust activities in the south, there is a low chance that
serious epidemics will develop at this stage. For most of the North Central
region, considering the present scenario, it is unlikely that ASR will
appear in fields before mid-August. If ASR is found around mid-August, the
disease is unlikely to cause any significant damage. - Mod.DH]
