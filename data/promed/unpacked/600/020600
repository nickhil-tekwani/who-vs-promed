United States of America 14.V-30.XII.1999(1)[14 May-30 Dec 1999]

--
[Can anyone tell us the strain(s) of cholera involved, the country(ies)
from which they were imported, & the reason for the delay in reporting? All
cases of cholera are required to be reported to WHO within 24 hours. WHO
can't do its job of notifying properly if countries don't do their job of
reporting promptly. - Mod.JW]
