In response to recent discussions on BTV15 in Israel, [hereby] some facts
about South African BTV15 that may be of interest.
According to our data, the BTV15 reference strain was isolated from cattle
in 1960 at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute. S2 phylogeny (aa
sequences) of the 24 BTV and 8 EHDV reference strains show that BTV 12, 15
and 22 are more closely related to EHDV than to BTV. This is especially
interesting since both BTV 12 and BTV 15 reference strains were originally
isolated from cattle (BTV 12 was isolated from cattle in Pretoria in 1941).
Since 1985, we have isolated only 3 BTV 15 viruses from the field (all
ovine isolates). We have sequenced S2 partially to confirm the genotypes of
these isolates. This sequence is available to anyone who is interested. BTV
15 is not very prevalent in SA and therefore not [included] in the SA
vaccine repertoire.
In the mean time we will start [to] complete genome amplification and
sequence analysis of our BTV 15 isolates for comparison to
Israeli/Pirbright data.

[The essential issue that Israel (and other Middle-Eastern countries)
confront following the identification of BT15 in the region is the
protection of susceptible sheep breeds against the said genotype which is
currently not included in any vaccine. Vaccination should be applied before
the next BTV season, which usually commences in July/August.
According to information included in figure 1 "Serological
cross-neutralisation of bluetongue virus serotypes" in the referenced paper
below, there seems to be some cross-neutralisation between BTV 2 (one of
the genotypes included in the commercial, polyvalent, live-attenuated South
African vaccine) and BTV 15.
Will BTV2, or any other of the 15 genotypes which are currently included in
the S.A. vaccine, protect against BTV15? Complementary information will
help. - Mod.AS]
