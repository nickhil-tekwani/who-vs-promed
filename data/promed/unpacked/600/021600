[The following is an extract (submitted by Dr Monir Taha) from a news
article published in Nature 2005; 433: 787, 24 Feb, by David Cyranoski,
entitled "Tests in Tokyo reveal flaws in Viet Nam's bird flu surveillance."

New evidence shows that cases of avian influenza have been overlooked
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Efforts to diagnose human cases of avian influenza in Asia have been
missing the mark, according to studies released last week [3rd week Feb
2005]. The findings have prompted calls for broader surveillance of the
virus and a change in testing procedures.
Reanalysis of samples from Vietnamese patients with flu-like symptoms has
revealed that some people originally declared free of avian influenza
actually did carry the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus. And another study
has shown that some patients with symptoms other than those usually
associated with [avian] influenza were also suffering from H5N1 virus
infection.
The findings are worrying, as they could mean that the virus has spread
much more widely than was previously thought. This would, in theory, give
the H5N1 strain a greater chance of mutating into a form that passes easily
from person to person, potentially sparking a pandemic. Reassuringly,
preliminary genetic analyses at the National Institute of Infectious
Diseases (NIID) in Tokyo show that the virus has not mutated greatly since
last year [2004].
The recent findings could also lead experts to re-evaluate the severity of
bird flu. The death rate for infected patients has so far been very high;
10 of the 11 cases identified in Viet Nam since December 2004 have died.
But if many more cases are going unidentified, the mortality rate could be
much lower.
Samples from the 11 recent cases of avian influenza in Viet Nam, plus those
from some 90 suspected cases that tested negative for H5N1 virus, were
recently sent to the NIID for study. About 1/3 of the samples have been
examined so far, and, of these, 7 of the negative results have tested
positive, says Phan Van Tu, head of the microbiology and immunology
department at the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. Fresh
tests in Viet Nam last week [3rd week Feb 2005] confirmed 4 of these
positive results.
Part of the discrepancy between labs could be accounted for by problems
with the original tests. "Some reagents were not mixed well, and the
results weren't clear," says Tu. But for 3 cases, the Pasteur researchers
-- together with NIID researchers observing -- reconfirmed their earlier
negative diagnosis. This is worrying, as it suggests that the Vietnamese
test is not sensitive enough to detect all cases. Tu says that the
institute now plans to switch to the more sensitive test used in Tokyo and
will ensure better training for its technicians. If many infections have
been missed, "suspected cases of human-to-human transmission should be
investigated again," says a member of a World Health Organization (WHO)
collaborating laboratory. There has so far been only one documented case of
probable human-to-human transmission (K Ungchusak, et al. N Engl J Med
2005; 352: 333-40), but there are strong suspicions that clusters of
disease within Asian families may have been transmitted through people
rather than birds.
Concerns about H5N1 monitoring efforts have also been fuelled by a study
showing that at least one case of encephalitis -- a swelling of the brain
-- in Viet Nam was caused by H5N1 virus (MD de Jong, et al. N Engl J Med
2005; 352: 686-91). Previously, it was thought that the only clinical
symptom of H5N1 virus infection was respiratory disease. As encephalitis is
relatively common in Viet Nam, this could mean that a broader approach to
H5N1 virus monitoring is needed, says Menno de Jong, a virologist at the
Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, who led the study. The
known cases of H5N1 viruses may be just the "tip of the iceberg", he says.
Although he notes that in an analysis of a further 100 encephalitis
patients none was infected with avian influenza virus, other cases could
have slipped through the net if the patients had mild respiratory illness,
de Jong says, as only severe cases have been studied. He and his group have
now begun a one year survey to look for H5N1 virus among 1600 children in
Viet Nam with mild symptoms.

[Continuing doubts about the sensitivity of the diagnostic test performed
in different laboratories makes many of these statements difficult to
interpret, and much is being concluded from a few cases. For example, it
has been widely reported that encephalitis may be associated with avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus infection, whereas 100 encephalitis cases examined
subsequently were found to be H5N1 virus-negative. Convincing
seroprevalence data are still lacking. The Japanese data now favor an
interpretation that avian influenza virus infection of humans is widespread
and mostly unapparent. If confirmed, such data should be a cause for
rejoicing rather than a reason for generating further alarm and
despondency. - Mod.CP]
