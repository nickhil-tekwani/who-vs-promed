Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Mortalities of farmed _Penaeus monodon_ have been observed in some ponds at several farm sites. An event in late 2015 did not meet requirements for immediate notification; however, a Jan 2016 event does, and both events are reported here. Affected animals range from 35 to 95 days post stocking. Mortality rates have varied from negligible to approximately 90 percent. Hepatopancreatitis has been associated with populations of affected shrimp. The histopathology of the hepatopancreas in affected animals is consistent with that described for acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND); however, the disease does not meet the case definition for AHPND provided in the draft OIE Aquatic Code chapter that has been circulated to OIE members. Current diagnostic information on the disease is described below:

A member of the _Vibrio harveyi_ clade has been isolated from affected shrimp. _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ has been excluded. PCR tests (AP3 and AP4 assays) of the bacterial isolates from affected shrimp were positive for PirA and PirB toxin genes. AP1 and AP2 assays were negative (positive in control AHPND samples from Asia), indicating absence of the pVA1 plasmid associated with AHPND. Preliminary whole genome sequence analysis indicates that the PirA and PirB toxin genes may be integrated into the genome of the bacterial isolate. Laboratory investigations are continuing to complete whole genome sequence analysis and identify the bacterial isolate. Bioassays are being considered to confirm pathogenicity of the isolate. A national survey will be undertaken to determine the distribution of the disease.

Control measures
Measures applied: disinfection/disinfestations; quarantine; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Shrimp disease caused by _Vibrio_ sp. is one of the main limiting factors in the increasing production of shrimp farming. This disease may kill and cause high loss in shrimp culture in South East and East Asia (http://tinyurl.com/z9qjet2).

The following information was obtained from the factsheet titled "_Vibrio_ spp. (Vibrio Disease) of Cultured Shrimp" found in the Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Aquatic Animal Health website. See information and additional background at
http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/aah-saa/diseases-maladies/vibriosp-eng.html:

Common, generally accepted names of the organism or disease agent: vibriosis or bacterial disease, penaeid bacterial septicemia, penaeid vibriosis, luminescent vibriosis, red-leg disease, "sien dun" in Thai which translates to black splint, sea gull syndrome or "sindrome de gaviota" in Latin America.

Scientific name or taxonomic affiliation: _Vibrio_ spp. (i.e., _V. harveyi_, _V. vulnificus_, _V. anguillarum_, _V. splendidus_, _V. alginolyticus_, _V. nereis_, _V. parahaemolyticus_, _V. damsela_, _V. tubiashi_, _V. fluvialis_). _Vibrio penaeicida_ was described as a pathogen of cultured _Penaeus japonicus_ in Japan. Other Gram negative, oxidase positive bacteria (i.e. _Psuedomonas_ sp., _Aeromonas_ sp. and _Flavobacterium_ sp.) have also been isolated from shrimp with _Vibrio_ spp. infections.

Geographic distribution: Ubiquitous.

Host species: All cultured penaeids and cultured _Macrobrachium rosenbergii_ [giant river prawn] are susceptible under stressful conditions.

Impact on the host: Anorexia and behavioural changes. Some species and strains of Vibrio cause the shrimp to be luminescent. Mortality ranges from insignificant to 100 percent, particularly in post-larval and young juvenile shrimp. There is also concern over the appearance of antibiotic-resistant strains as reported for _V. harveyi_ that caused a mass mortality of cultured _Penaeus monodon_ larvae in India.

Diagnostic techniques:
Gross Observations: Vary with the type of infection -- black or brown cuticular lesions, opacity of musculature, tough and black branching filaments (up to 2 mm wide) in connective tissue of tail segments, black lymphoid (Oka) organ, melanization of appendage tips.
Wet Mounts: Large numbers of bacteria in the haemolymph.

Histology: Significant necrosis and inflammation especially in the Oka/lymphoid organ and frequently, but usually less severe, in the gills, heart, hepatopancreas and sometimes other tissues. Often there are rod-shaped bacteria (usually slightly curved) within the tissues.
Culture: Isolate _Vibrio_ spp. from tissue or haemolymph of moribund samples. The bacteria are not fastidious and will grow on a wide variety of nutrient agar media including the selective media Thiosulfate Citrate Bile Salts Agar. Detailed procedures and culture characteristics of several species of Vibrio were described by Lightner (1996).

Methods of control: Maintain adequate water quality with low bacterial biomass, a stable phytoplankton bloom and a proper feeding program. Sterilize or filter recirculated water. Routinely monitor shrimp and pond for early diagnosis of a problem. Avoid temperature extremes or rapid variation in temperature, handling, overcrowding, and other stressors. Infections are opportunistic and probably result from poor husbandry; may be secondary to other disease processes. In Thailand (and probably at other locations) the incidence of antibiotic resistance in the isolated strains was high.

"Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) emerged as a new disease of shrimp in 2010. The disease is sometimes referred to as early mortality syndrome, which is a broader term used to describe a range of shrimp health problems that lead to early mortality. AHPND has a bacterial aetiology. A bacterial isolate identified as a member of the _Vibrio harveyi_ clade, most closely related to _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, has been found to cause AHPND experimentally. Further studies to characterise the causative agent, including genetic characterisation, are continuing." http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Internationa_Standard_Setting/docs/pdf/Aquatic_Commission/AHPND_DEC_2013.pdf

As noted in the epidemiologic comments, "this disease does not meet the case definition for AHPND provided in the draft OIE Aquatic Code chapter circulated to OIE members. Laboratory investigations are continuing to complete whole genome sequence analysis and identify the bacterial isolate. Bioassays are being considered to confirm the pathogenicity of the isolate."

Australia is to be commended for sharing this information to the OIE and thus, to the Member countries. - Mod.CRD
