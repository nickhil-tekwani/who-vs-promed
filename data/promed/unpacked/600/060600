Illinois: West Nile Virus in Squirrels, Wolf and a Dog
------------------------------------------------------
Squirrels:
In the last several weeks we have identified West Nile virus (WNV)
infection in several grey squirrels in both the Chicago area and in
down-state Illinois. The clinical signs in the grey squirrels
included lethargy, biting at their paws, vocalizing or crying out as
if in pain, ataxia, and walking in circles. Reports of similar signs
in squirrels have been received since mid-summer 2002. The primary
lesions in the squirrels were those of a viral encephalitis with mild
myocarditis. The presence of WNV in the brain and spinal cord of at
least 3 squirrels was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in our
laboratory, and by PCR in 2 other laboratories within the state
(Public Health and DNR).
Further investigations of additional squirrels from other parts of
the state are in progress in cooperation with and support from the
Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Public Health.
Wolf:
In addition, WNV encephalitis was identified in a 3-month-old wolf
from a small zoologic collection in the southwest Chicago area. This
animal exhibited clinical CNS symptoms and was confirmed by IHC, and
PCR by 3 different laboratories.
Dog:
An 8-year-old dog from central Illinois exhibited weakness which
progressed to neurologic and cardiac signs over a 4-day period and
was euthanized in a moribund state. This animal had histologic
changes of a viral encephalitis and myocarditis. WNV infection was
again confirmed in 3 different laboratories by IHC, and PCR methods.
There was also evidence in this dog of a concurrent immune-mediated
disease.
Conclusions:
We are unaware of previous reports of documented clinical disease and
death losses in grey squirrels, wolves, and dogs due to WNV in the
US. We believe that the wolf and dog cases probably represent a
sporadic occurrence in young or immunocompromised animals. The
multiple occurrences in the grey squirrel population appears to be a
significant infection and cause of death for that species.

Illinois: Dog's death is first Associated With West Nile Virus Infection
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The nation's first death of a dog from West Nile virus infection has
been confirmed in Illinois. Researchers at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign said on Tue 17 Sep 2002 that they also found that
the disease had killed 2 other types of animals: a wolf and 3
squirrels brought in for testing.
The deaths are the latest evidence that the mosquito-borne virus --
known to kill humans, horses and birds -- is becoming more
widespread. Epidemiologists previously thought that dogs could be
infected with the virus, but that the disease wouldn't kill them. "Up
until this point, we didn't think there was much need for concern
with dogs," said Dr. John Andrews, a veterinarian and director of the
University's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Still, there's no need
to fret about every Fido and Rover. The dog that died, an 8-year-old
Irish setter-golden retriever mix from the Bloomington-Normal area,
already had a weakened immune system from another illness, Andrews
said. "We still think dogs are quite resistant," he said. "This being
the first reported case in a dog suggests that there has been a large
number infected, and only this one has died."
The federal Centers for Disease Control has registered at least 1540
human cases, including 71 deaths. Horses and birds, especially crows,
blue jays, and hawks, are particularly sensitive to the disease.
"We've said all along that all mammals are susceptible, because we
give off carbon dioxide, which is what attracts the mosquito to us,"
said Roberta Renicker, a community health nurse in the Missouri
Department of Health and Senior Services' communicable disease
control section. Missouri has not tested for or found the virus in
mammals other than humans and horses, she said. The CDC's Web site
said Tue 17 Sep 2002 that disease from West Nile virus infection in
dogs had not been previously documented.
The veterinary lab at the University of Illinois also confirmed that
West Nile virus killed 3 gray squirrels: 2 from Chicago and one from
Champaign. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources sent the dead
animals for testing after officials suspected an outbreak among the
state's squirrel population. "We've been getting reports for the last
several weeks of unusual signs: squirrels biting their paws, wobbling
on their feet, walking in circles, vocalizing, crying out as if in
pain," Andrews said. The number of squirrels may dip temporarily, but
Andrews said he did not expect the population to be decimated.
A private zoo in Will County, southwest of Chicago, submitted a dead
wolf for testing. As with the dog, the owner wanted an autopsy to see
why the animal died, but didn't initially suspect West Nile virus,
Andrews said. For both the dog and the wolf, researchers at the
veterinary lab first eliminated the possibility that the animals died
of common canine diseases, such as distemper or rabies. Researchers
then detected the West Nile virus in the animals' tissue. Blood serum
tests are not available for living dogs, Andrews said, so the only
way to tell if West Nile is the culprit is by a post-mortem exam.
Andrews suggested that owners of very young or old dogs, or dogs with
an existing illness, may want to take extra precautions. He suggested
keeping such dogs inside during dawn and dusk hours when mosquitoes
are most active, or shrouding their outdoor pens with mosquito
netting.
Dogs are still believed to be fairly resistant to illness from the
virus. No cat deaths from the virus have been reported. Owners of
young, old, or sick dogs may want to keep their pets indoors during
dawn and dusk hours. Do not apply insect repellent to dogs; it can
poison them if they lick it.

Alaska: West Nile Virus Case Imported from Illinois
---------------------------------------------------
Alaska has confirmed its first reported case of West Nile virus, in a
77-year-old man from the Chicago suburbs who lies seriously ill in an
Anchorage hospital, state health authorities said on Wednesday
afternoon 18 Sep 2002. The man was bitten by an infected mosquito in
Illinois and is not contagious, said officials with the Alaska
Division of Public Health. They would not release his name. State
officials predicted he will recover. The man flew from Chicago to
Anchorage on 24 Aug 2002 and arrived feeling tired but otherwise
fine. But the next day, he went to the Providence Alaska Medical
Center emergency room.
Authorities say it's impossible an Alaska mosquito infected him: The
virus takes at least 3 days and up to a week for symptoms to show,
and the state's mosquito season is virtually over. Alaska is one of 8
states without reported cases of West Nile in birds, horses or
humans. The current case will be officially counted on Illinois's
ticket.
Authorities spreading the word of the Illinois man Wednesday wanted
to make it clear that Alaskans aren't now at risk from this man or
the virus. "Next spring if birds arrive with West Nile virus and
mosquitoes break out and we start seeing local cases, I think we're
going to be a lot more worried," said Dr. Bruce Chandler, the city's
medical officer. "Any disease anywhere in the world can be here in 24
hours." People who flew to Anchorage on the same plane with the
infected man are not at any greater risk, officials said. West Nile
virus is not spread person-to-person.
City and state health officials said they expect the infected man in
Anchorage to recover, and his family is with him. The hospital
refused to release his condition.The virus apparently came on fast,
according to a bulletin issued Wednesday afternoon by the Division of
Public Health:The man started feeling ill on 25 Aug and developed
increased urinary frequency, headache, and a 102-degree fever. By the
time he arrived at the hospital that night, he was mildly confused.
Then he started having trouble speaking. By 27 Aug 2002, hospital
tests revealed viral meningitis, an inflammation of the lining of the
brain and spinal cord. The hospital sent samples to the CDC lab in
Fort Collins, Colorado, to be evaluated for possible West Nile
infection. The lab confirmed on Wed the preliminary results given to
the state on Tuesday. The man has both meningitis and encephalitis --
potentially fatal conditions that develop if the virus jumps from the
blood to brain tissue.
The credit for identifying this case goes to the savvy Providence
medical staff, said Jewel Jones, director of the city's Department of
Health and Human Services. They recognized the symptoms of meningitis
and encephalitis, then considered the man's trip from the Chicago
area. "We're glad we do have astute care providers keeping up with
something like that," she said. Expert opinion varies, but officials
currently predict it's unlikely the virus will gain a foothold in
Alaska because of its short summers and brief mosquito season,
McLaughlin said.

[2] Ohio; West Nile Virus Activity, 1 Jan to 12 Sep 2002
-------------------------------------------------------
During the period 1 Jan to 12 Sep 2002, the Ohio Department of Health
(ODH) identified 133 persons with positive initial test results for
WNV in cerebrospinal fluid or serum (IgM ELISA); 3 cases were
laboratory confirmed at CDC by plaque reduction neutralization test.
Seven cases were fatal.
The 133 patients had a median age of 61 years (range: 9 to 98 years);
71 (53 percent) were male. The median age for 29 patients with known
diagnosis of either aseptic meningitis (17 cases), encephalitis (10
cases), meningo-encephalitis (one case) or acute flaccid paralysis
(one case) was 52 years (range: 9 to 86 years); 14 (48 percent) were
male. The median age of the 7 decedents was 79 (range: 68 to 88
years) years; 5 (71 percent) were men. Onset of symptoms of WNV
infection among reported patients occurred during 27 Jul to 8 Sep
2002. All cases remain under investigation.
Human cases have occurred among residents of 20 counties, with 96 (72
percent) cases reported from the most populated county in Ohio,
Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland with 32 cases. The attack
rate during 1 Jan to 12 Sep 2002 was 1.2 per 100 000 for the state
population, 7.0 for Cuyahoga County, and 6.7 for Cleveland.
Of Ohio's 88 counties, 87 (99 percent) reported WNV activity in
horses, birds, or mosquitoes. The first bird tested positive on 19
May 2002. Of the 1643 dead birds tested, 855 (52 percent) have tested
positive for WNV by polymerase chain reaction. Mosquito pools began
testing positive on 28 May 2002. As of 11 Sep 20021, a total of 1018
mosquito pools have tested positive, and 133 horses from 49 counties
have tested laboratory-positive. Public health authorities plan to
continue surveillance for human and equine cases through October 2002.
The Ohio WNV Work Group comprises representatives from the
departments of Health, Agriculture, Environmental Protection, and
Natural Resources and coordinates surveillance and response
activities. Ohio has a program for technical support of public
agencies performing mosquito-management services. The established
partnership between the Ohio Mosquito Control Association, ODH, the
Ohio Pest Control Association, the Ohio State University Extension,
and local mosquito-control agencies provided training to persons with
an interest in mosquito management. ODH helps local governments
establish mosquito-management programs. Ohio's prevention activities
include risk communication and informing the public about how to
avoid exposure through source reduction and personal protection.
