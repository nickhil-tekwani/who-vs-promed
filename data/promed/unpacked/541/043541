[In West Bengal] 2 cases of dengue were reported from Birbhum's
Chinpai and Bakreswar today [2 Oct 2008]. A 40-year-old man from
Birbhum's Chinpai village was admitted to Suri Sadar hospital on
Tuesday [30 Sep 2008] after he complained of symptoms similar to
dengue. He is now under treatment in Suri Sadar Hospital. Another
patient, a 32-year-old woman, a resident of Bakreswar Thermal Power
Project Township, was admitted to the Suri Sadar hospital with
symptoms of dengue. She was shifted to the Kolkata Medical College
and Hospital today [2 Oct 2008].

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Das for forwarding the article that mentioned
these dengue cases. Although 2 dengue cases hardly constitute an
outbreak, their occurrence is interesting as they happened in the
midst of a chikungunya virus outbreak reported in this same article
(see ProMED archive no. 20081002.3112).

This illustrates the essential role of laboratory diagnosis to
distinguish which viruses are being transmitted in a situation like
this one where clinical presentations may be similar.

The National Institute of Health, Islamabad has confirmed as many as
11 persons infected with dengue virus up to Saturday [5 Oct 2008], of
which 10 belong to Basal village while one was from Thatta village in
tehsil Jand. [A tehsil is an administrative division that consists of
a city or town that serves as its headquarters, and may contain
additional towns, and a number of villages. - Mod.TY]

"We have so far sent more than 200 blood samples of dengue fever
suspects from 4 high-risk villages of tehsil Jand to the NIH
(National Institute of Health) for confirmatory tests," said district
health officer [DHO] Attock Dr Sultan Mehmood Khan, while talking to
'The News' Saturday [5 Oct 2008] , added that the surveillance teams
are still busy on prevention and control of the infection in the area.

Confirmation of 8 positive cases within one week in tehsil Jand of
district Attock had convinced health officials to believe in
recurrence of the dengue fever outbreak, as the confirmation of cases
proved the existence of mosquito causing infection [transmitting the
virus] in the area. The DHO office has established 4 medical camps
one each in village Basal, village Thatta, village Bomail, and Pind
Sultani for checking up suspects of the disease. "The camps remained
operational during Eid holidays," claimed Dr Sultan adding nearly 700
persons with high fever have gone under medical examination at the 4
camps within past 4 days. "We have received results of nearly 175
cases from the NIH so far of which only 11 have been tested
positive," he said adding his office has yet to receive final reports
in some 25 cases. "It seems as the situation is well under control
now as on Friday [4 Oct 2008] after examining some 200 persons with
fever, we found only 6 suspects of dengue fever and sent their blood
samples to the NIH."

He said the downward trend of occurrence of the infection might be
the result of fogging in the high-risk areas. "2 rounds of fogging
have already been performed in the 4 high-risk towns," he said while
responding to a query adding his office would ensure a total of 5
sessions of fogging in the areas for prevention of the disease.

Dr Sultan added that the medical camps established in the 4 towns
would be operational till elimination of the infection from the area.

[Fogging may provide temporary reduction of adult _Aedes_ vectors of
dengue virus, but will not provide longer-term control. Reduction in
mosquito breeding sites is required for that. Since a relatively
small proportion of the febrile cases were confirmed as due to dengue
virus infection, one wonders what the etiologies were for the
majority of the patients.

According to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine that
exposes a vulnerability in the nation's blood supply, 3 people
contracted the potentially lethal dengue virus from a blood donor in
Singapore last year [2007].

Scientists led by Paul Tambyah at the National University of
Singapore said in the report, 2 men, aged 64 and 72, suffered fever,
muscle pain and fluid build-up in their chests after receiving blood
donated by a 52-year-old man. A 3rd man, 74, was infected without
suffering any symptoms. All 3 were discharged from hospital in good
health, the report said.

Dengue, the world's most common mosquito-borne disease, is endemic in
Singapore, where it has infected more than 4600 people this year
[2008]. The flu-like illness strikes about 50 million people annually
worldwide and leads to about 500 000 hospitalizations, mostly
children, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). At least
2.5 percent of patients die.

"Although screening is expensive, confidence in the blood supply
could outweigh cost-effectiveness considerations,'' Tambyah and
colleagues wrote in a letter to the journal's editor.

Singapore doesn't screen blood donors for dengue because available
tests would take 4 weeks, rendering blood platelets that must be used
within 5 days useless, Tan Hwee Huang, deputy division director of
blood supply at the Health Sciences Authority, said in a 30 Sep
[2008] telephone interview.

Singapore's Health Sciences Authority rejects blood donors showing
symptoms of dengue, and asks those who may have been exposed to defer
giving blood, according to the authority. It also removes blood
donations from people subsequently diagnosed with an infection or who
show symptoms.

The infected blood came from a repeat donor who gave blood in July
last year [2007], the report said. He later told the blood bank he
had a fever the day after the donation, prompting an investigation.
The 3 men who were subsequently infected were being treated for
diseases including diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, kidney
failure, and cancer.

[This is an interesting case where the blood donor was viremic but
not yet showing symptoms of dengue virus infection, so he was not
rejected as a donor.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett also forwarded this story.

report [edited]

Health officials in American Samoa say there were more confirmed
cases of dengue fever reported in the US territory in September
[2008] than in all of 2007.

The Department of Health says the 115 cases of the mosquito-borne
disease brought the total number so far this year [2008] to 162,
compared with 109 last year [2007]. One person, a 10-year-old boy,
died of the disease this year.

The department is urging residents to clean areas where mosquitoes breed.

American Samoa is located 2300 miles (3700 kilometers) south of Hawaii.

[On 29 Sep 2008 Radio New Zealand International
<http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=3Dread&id=3D42263> &id=3D42263>
reported that Samoa's Ministry of Health is predicting a drop in the
number of dengue fever cases this month. As of the third week of 27
Sep [2008] 57 people had the virus compared with 219 in July and 281
in August. The ministry however is concerned that not all cases being
treated are being reported by doctors.

Health officials in New Caledonia say the number of reported cases of
dengue fever has now reached 1000.

The department says the outbreak overwhelmingly concerns the [dengue
virus] type 1 variety [serotype].

It says this is in contrast to several neighbouring Pacific island
countries, such as Fiji, Kiribati, Samoa, and American Samoa where
the epidemic has been identified as one of [dengue virus] type 4.

Health authorities in both New Caledonian and French Polynesia, say
they are on the alert for visitors or returning travellers, who could
"import" the disease [virus].

Public spraying campaigns have also been carried out in the past
month, especially in the capital Nouma and its suburbs.

Health experts have concluded that collated information produced by
local authorities and Institute Veille de Sanitaire (INVS) confirms
St Martin is at the beginning of a fresh outbreak of dengue, that
effectively began 10 days ago [23 Sep 2008] and urges preventative
treatments be "rigorously" implemented.

In a release issued by the Prefecture Thursday [2 Oct 2008], La
Cellule Inter-Regionale d'Epidemiologie (CIRE) of Antilles-Guyana met
with the Committee of Experts for Infectious Diseases in the Northern
Islands on Wednesday [1 Oct 2008] to analyse the current situation.

The release contained no statistics or figures, but went on to say
"given the favourable climatic conditions for development of
mosquitoes, preventative measures already known by the population
must be implemented without delay and in a rigorous manner. It is at
this early stage that preventative measures can be most effective."

In accordance with this information, an intensive fogging campaign
begins as of today [4 Oct 2008], Friday. It is advised to leave house
doors and windows open when the truck passes for the chemical to be
most effective.

The dengue management committee is due to meet again on 16 Oct [2008]
to assess the local situation.

The Prefecture of St. Martin and St. Barths once again reminds the
population of the action to be taken to prevent the spread of dengue
[virus] which is transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.

Anti-mosquito sprays and creams should be used liberally. Wear long
sleeved shirts and long pants in the evenings. Make sure mosquito
screens are installed on windows and doors. Young children, babies,
and elderly persons should sleep under mosquito netting.

Throw out any stagnant water collecting in flower vases, or other
receptacles, around the house or in the yard and make sure rain
gutters are unblocked after heavy rainfall. Stagnant pools of water
are prime breeding grounds for mosquitoes.

Cisterns must be covered with mosquito netting. It is also encouraged
to breed Guppy fish, which feed on mosquito larvae. Check the septic
tank is functioning properly.

Currently there is no specific treatment or vaccine for dengue.
