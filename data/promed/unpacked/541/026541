Nearly 900 horses tested for blood-borne parasite
-------------------------------------------------
More than 860 horses in the United States have so far been tested for
the tick-borne disease, equine piroplasmosis, as authorities work to
eliminate an outbreak centered on Texas.

The disease, which can be carried by certain species of ticks, has
been confirmed in 334 horses, according to the US Department of
Agriculture's latest report to the World Organisation for Animal
Health (OIE).

"To date," said spokesman Dr John Clifford, "even though _Theileria
equi_ positive horses have been identified in 12 states, all positive
horses are directly epidemiologically linked to the index premises.

"All positive equine piroplasmosis horses identified so far in the
investigation are either currently living on the index premises or
previously lived on the index premises."

He said 289 positive horses are located on the index ranch in Texas,
22 are on other premises in Texas, 1 is in Alabama, 2 are in
California, 5 are in Florida, 1 is in Georgia, 5 are in Louisiana, 1
is in Minnesota, 2 are in North Carolina, 3 are in New Jersey, 1 is in
Tennessee, 1 is in Utah, and 1 is in Wisconsin.

He said all known positive horses remain under quarantine.

Dr Clifford said ticks, which have been shown to be experimentally
capable of transmitting the disease have been found on the Texas
property.

"Additional tick transmission studies are pending and the tick
investigations are continuing," he said.

_Theileria equi_ is a protozoan, which can also be spread either by
ticks or through use of shared, contaminated needles.

[It is not surprising that this disease continues to be found. It
seems there may be more than one species of tick capable of carrying
and spreading the disease. If that is indeed the case, then this
disease may be smoldering undetected in other areas with similar
habitat to the index premises. - Mod.TG]
