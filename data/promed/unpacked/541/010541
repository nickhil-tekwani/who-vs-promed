Regarding ProMED-mail Archive Number 20090711.2480, the moderator's
comment that "White-tailed deer in the United States (Michigan) have
been classified as maintenance hosts; however, some authors now
believe they may be spillover hosts" is surprising.

This statement originates from the University of Iowa fact sheet cited
in the ProMED post, and it would be of interest to learn who "some
authors" are. The history of the Michigan outbreak is in fact the
reverse, that initially it was believed that deer infections had
resulted from spillover from cattle. In the subsequent decade and a
half it has become clear that there is stable, persistent cycling of
infection in the deer (see for example:
<http://www.michigan.gov/documents/TB_International_Review_report_final_138759_7.doc>) with no credible evidence to suggest this is being supported by ongoing transmission of infection to the deer from cattle or other wildlife
species.

[Dr.Hickling is correct that the experience in Michigan does
contradict the statement in the fact sheet from the University of
Iowa. However, it may be true in other states. It will be interesting
to see which way the spillover goes in the state of Indiana.
However, while Dr. Hickling is correct in the Michigan experience,
there are still many people who are willing to vilify the captive
cervid industry without taking the time to examine the wildlife and
the epidemiology of the situation.

We thank Dr. Hickling for his comments. - Mod.TG]
