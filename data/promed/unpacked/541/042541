Abnormal mortalities of wild boars have been found in Ardeche since July 2013, creating a crisis in the prefecture. The origin of the deaths has not been established to date.

"90 boars have died since July 2013 in conditions that cannot be explained. One of our main lines of investigation is toxicology, since all necropsies and tests have ruled out an infectious element (microbes or virus), said Lionel Speaks, deputy director at the DDCSPP [Department of Social Cohesion and Protection of the Population] to the AFP [Agence France Press] in Privas on Tuesday [15 Oct 2013].

Just in the week of 2-9 Oct 2013, "10 boars were found dead, including 4 who are considered to be possibly related to the phenomenon of unexplained deaths," noted the prefecture on Tuesday [15 Oct 2013]. The 1st report occurred on 23 Jul 2013 in the town of Vals-les-Bains. The deaths are concentrated in 2 areas of the department, Vals-les-Bains and the valley of Eyrieux (St. Pierreville Saint-Fortunat sur Eyrieux).

The possibility of an epidemic of swine fever or pseudorabies disease (viral Aujesky's disease) was quickly dismissed at the end of the summer [2013] after analysis by the reference laboratory of the National Agency for Safety of Food & the Environment (ANSES) at Ploufagran (Cotes d'Armor). The analyses were also assigned to the center of toxicological expertise from veterinary school in Lyon.

Considering 40 substances (rat poisons, pesticides, ethylene glycol, etc.), all results were negative. The dying animals were observed and filmed with nervous disorders present: tremors, convulsions, spasms, and pedaling [of the legs]. The prefect issued an order on 4 Sep 2013 prohibiting the consumption and marketing of boars from the 29 municipalities involved, the corpses to be dispatched for rendering.

"We found that the small wild boars, 15 to 25 kg, are the most affected. We hunters are concerned, worried, and reluctant to hunt," a hunter who prefers to remain anonymous told the AFP [Agence France Press]. The deputy director of the DDCSPP confirmed that it was mostly young boars, adding that new sample analyses are under way, "selected from wild boar corpses in better shape to broaden the scope of toxicology substances tested. The matter is in the hands of researchers in France and outside of France," he further said.

Re the statement: "10 boars were found dead, including 4 [which] are considered to be possibly related to the phenomenon of unexplained deaths," noted the prefecture on Tuesday [15 Oct 2013]."

***This raises the question of what the other 6 died of. - Mod.JW
