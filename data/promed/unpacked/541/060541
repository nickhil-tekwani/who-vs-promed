Vaccination for FMD to Zimbabwe
--------------------------------
South Africa is going to make vaccination worth 12 million ZAR (1 564 120
USD) available to Zimbabwe.
The Minister of Agriculture and Land Affairs, Ms Thoko Didiza, said that
this was part of the regional strategy to prevent the spreading of the
disease from Zimbabwe.
The Agricultural Research Council will deliver the first batch of 39 000
dosages in the near future. Ms Didiza said that the security at all fences
was improved to decrease the risk of the disease across the borders.

[Zimbabwe's urgent need for FMD vaccines, in view of the spreading
epizootic and its impact upon the region, has been dealt with in several
previous ProMED-mail postings. The urgent need to control this outbreak is
common to all beef-exporting countries in Southern Africa. Initial
assistance was obtained from the FAO. The requested assistance from the
South African government was initially reported in January 2003: see
