Source identified and case definition established: multistate investigation of non-travel associated _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ infections (melioidosis) in 4 patients: Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota, and Texas - 2021
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
-------
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that the strain of _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ in bottles of aromatherapy room spray matches the bacterial strain that sickened all 4 patients. The outbreak strain was identified in a bottle of "Lavender & Chamomile" scented room spray found in the home of the Georgia resident who was infected and died from _B. pseudomallei_ infection (melioidosis) in July 2021. That same outbreak strain was also identified in an unopened bottle of the same scented product recalled from a Walmart store in a different state.

This Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Update is an update to HAN Health Update 455: source implicated in fatal case in Georgia: multistate investigation of non-travel associated _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ infections (melioidosis) in 4 patients: Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota, and Texas - 2021, that CDC issued on [22 Oct 2021]. The purpose of this HAN Update is to share an interim case definition, case notification guidance, and case reporting guidance for public health jurisdictions investigating additional potential cases related to this outbreak.

This investigation was previously described in HAN Health Update 448: new case identified: multistate investigation of non-travel associated _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ infections (melioidosis) in 4 patients: Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota, and Texas - 2021, that was issued on [9 Aug 2021], and HAN Health Advisory 444: multistate investigation of non-travel associated _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ infections (melioidosis) in 3 patients: Kansas, Texas, and Minnesota - 2021, that was issued on [30 Jun 2021].

Background
----------
Currently, 4 cases have been identified as part of this outbreak. The contaminated product linked to the 4 cases is the Better Homes and Gardens-branded Essential Oil Infused Aromatherapy Room Spray with Gemstones "Lavender & Chamomile" scent. This product was sold online nationwide through Walmart and distributed to a limited number of Walmart stores between February [2021] and [21 Oct 2021]. Testing for the presence of _B. pseudomallei_ is underway for the 5 other scents under the same brand with Gemstones including "Lemon & Mandarin", "Lavender", "Peppermint", "Lime & Eucalyptus", and "Sandalwood & Vanilla".

People who have the Better Homes & Gardens Aromatherapy Room Spray "Lavender & Chamomile" with Gemstones product, or any of the other recalled scents with Gemstones (Lemon & Mandarin, Lavender, Peppermint, Lime & Eucalyptus, and Sandalwood & Vanilla) in their homes should follow the precautions listed in HAN Health Update 455 issued on [22 Oct 2021] (https://www.cdc.gov/melioidosis/outbreak/2021/index.html).

_Burkholderia pseudomallei_, the causative agent of melioidosis, is a Tier 1 select agent that can infect animals and humans. Cases are most common in areas of the world with tropical and sub-tropical climates. Normally, approximately a dozen cases are reported to CDC annually that predominantly occur in people returning from a country where the disease is endemic.

Recommendations
---------------
For the purposes of this outbreak, an interim case definition (adapted from an existing national case definition) and interim suggestions for case notification and reporting for public health jurisdictions investigating additional potential cases related to this outbreak are provided here:

Exposure definition
-------------------
Product description:
Better Homes and Gardens-branded Essential Oil Infused Aromatherapy Room Spray with Gemstones in the following scents:
-Lavender & Chamomile
-Lemon & Mandarin
-Lavender
-Peppermint
-Lime & Eucalyptus
-Sandalwood & Vanilla

This product list is preliminary and may change as additional information from the investigation becomes available.

Exposure is defined as:
-being in the room while the product is being sprayed
-having directly "sniffed" or inhaled from the product bottle
-having direct contact with an item (such as pillowcases or other linens) on which the product has been sprayed

Clinical description:
Clinical presentation of the disease varies on a case-by-case basis. The following characteristics are typical of melioidosis:
- An acute or chronic localized infection which may or may not include symptoms of fever and muscle aches. Such infection often results in ulcer, nodule, or skin abscess.
- An acute pulmonary infection with symptoms of high fever, headache, chest pain, anorexia, and general muscle soreness.
- A bloodstream infection with symptoms of fever, headache, respiratory distress, abdominal discomfort, joint pain, muscle tenderness, or disorientation.
- A disseminated infection with symptoms of fever, neurological symptoms (for example, altered mental status, headache, seizure, extremity weakness), muscle or joint pain, weight loss, or stomach or chest pain. Abscesses in the liver, lung, spleen, and prostate are often observed in patients diagnosed with disseminated infections; brain abscesses may also be seen.

Laboratory criteria for diagnosis
---------------------------------
Suspect cases (suspect lab evidence):
- Evidence of titer result by IHA ≥1:160 on acute-phase serum specimen
- Evidence of titer result by IHA ≥1:160 on convalescent-phase serum specimen that is stable/unchanged from acute-phase serum specimen titer result obtained greater than or equal to 2 weeks apart.

Probable cases (presumptive lab evidence):
- Evidence of a 4-fold or greater rise in _B. pseudomallei_ antibody titer by IHA between acute- and convalescent-phase serum specimens obtained greater than or equal to 2 weeks apart.
- Evidence of _B. pseudomallei_ DNA (e.g., by LRN-validated polymerase chain reaction) in a clinical specimen collected from a normally sterile site (for example, blood).

Confirmed cases (definitive lab evidence):
- Isolation and confirmation of _B. pseudomallei_ from a clinical specimen of a case of severe febrile illness: culture of the organism may be done by blood, sputum, urine, pus, throat swab, swabs from organ abscesses or wounds, or tissue collected postmortem.
- Whole genome sequencing (WGS) and strain analysis links isolate to outbreak strain.
- Immunohistochemical (IHC) evidence of _B. pseudomallei_ in a tissue specimen.

Case classification
-------------------
Suspect case:
A case that meets the clinical description, meets one or more of the suspect lab criteria (suspect lab evidence), and meets any of the following:
- has known exposure to _B. pseudomallei_ (see Exposure Definition, above)
- has an epidemiological link to a confirmed case
- there is no history of travel to a _B. pseudomallei_ endemic place

Probable case:
A case that meets the clinical description, meets one or more of the probable lab criteria (presumptive lab evidence), and meets any of the following:
- has known exposure to _B. pseudomallei_ (see Exposure Definition, above)
- has an epidemiological link to a confirmed case
- there is no history of travel to a _B. pseudomallei_ endemic place

Confirmed case:
A case that meets either of the following:
- A case with or without a known exposure (see Exposure Definition, above), whose isolate from a clinical specimen is laboratory-confirmed, and WGS and strain analysis link isolate to outbreak strain.
- A case with a known exposure (see Exposure Definition, above), with no travel history to an endemic place, whose isolate from a clinical specimen is laboratory-confirmed with no WGS results.
- A case with a known exposure (see Exposure Definition, above), and immunohistochemical evidence of _B. pseudomallei_ in a tissue specimen.

Case reporting & notification
-----------------------------
Case reporting to the jurisdiction:
Requirements follow local, state, tribal, and territorial laws and regulations, and may differ by jurisdiction; please follow jurisdictional guidance.

[The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, and chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lungs can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, lung, liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80%-95%. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40%-50%. A small percentage of cases can occur as reactivations, even decades later, sometimes called the "Vietnamese time bomb".

Along with a case acquired in the USA from tropical fish imported from South Asia (Melioidosis - USA (03): (MD) non-travel, 2019, freshwater aquarium source 20211001.8698818), it has been a surprising year for this disease in the USA. It is yet to be determined what the mechanism of contamination of this product was and where along the manufacturing chain it occurred. - Mod.LL
