California: 2 Birds Test West Nile Virus Positive in Orange County
--------------------------------------------------
2 birds in Orange County tested positive for West Nile virus, marking the
first discovery of the mosquito-borne disease in California so far in 2004,
health officials said. The virus turned up in 2 adult female house finches
captured on 2 Mar 2004 at Craig Park in Fullerton. "We just have to start
preaching mosquito control," said James P. Webb, technical director at the
Orange County Vector Control District.
West Nile typically causes flu-like symptoms such as fever, nausea,
headache, and muscle aches -- and in rare cases, inflammation of the brain
and even death. Health officials urge people to take precautions,
particularly to avoid attracting mosquitoes. "They need to be careful of
breeding sources in the backyard. Anything that will hold water for a week
can produce mosquitoes. When it's as warm as it has been this past week,
they can go from egg to mosquito in less than a week," said vector control
spokesman Michael Hearst.
The virus first appeared in the United States in 1999, killing 7 people in
the New York area. During 2003, 2 men tested positive for the virus, one in
Orange County and the other in Riverside County. Colorado, Nebraska, South
Dakota, and Texas were the hardest-hit states in 2003. Together, they
accounted for more than half of the 231 deaths nationally and 2/3 of 9566
diagnosed cases, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.

[Throughout the coming transmission season, West Nile virus surveillance
updates will be posted at approximately weekly internals, or immediately on
receipt in the case of significant new developments such as extension of
range, infection of novel hosts, enhanced or reduced virulence, etc. It may
be indicative of the characteristics of the impending outbreak in 2004 that
the first reports have originated from the south (Texas) and the west coast
(California). - Mod.CP]
