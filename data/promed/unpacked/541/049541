I estimate that after half an hour, a carcass may still be infective. This may seem obvious, even irrelevant, but below is a little suggestive evidence.

When I was young and green in judgment, among a few risky things I did in Belize around 1985 were:

(a) Put my hand down a cow with "choke" which was probably rabid. This was not confirmed by a lab, but the cow died soon after;
and
(b) Conduct a field post-mortem on 2 dogs suspected of rabies, one of which was confirmed. Both dogs were in a clonic state and euthanased in the village. They were taken in the bright noonday sun to a location outside the village, where I and an assistant conducted a simple post mortem, which included removing the brain from the skull. The latter action was encouraged by the lab at the time, though to be honest, we preferred to send the whole head. We did wear gloves with alcohol inside them, masks, and goggles. But I do recollect feeling the bone spicules from the skull getting through the glove during the process of cutting open the head and removing the brain (half fresh, half in formalin).

Both the assistant, Felix Tzul, and I were rabies-vaccinated prior to the post-mortem. Subsequently, about one year later, all the vets were serum tested for rabies titers, One vet who had been active in a rabies outbreak in Cayo and myself had titers well above the vaccine titers found in the other vets. My titer could have been from the cow, or I was very reactive to rabies vaccine, or from the post mortem exposure.

I think an excellent question to ask is how long does infectivity remain in a carcass? There may be an enormous number of variables (alas!). Butchers often have self-inflicted minor cuts on their hands, and they do tend to cut animals into many small pieces, and in some countries, the butchering is such that there are many sharp bone processes.
