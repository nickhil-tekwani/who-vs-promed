1st Report of Gray Leaf Spot Caused by _Alternaria brassicae_ on Canola in
Argentina.
S. Gaetan and M. Madia, Catedra de Fitopatologia, Facultad de Agronomia,
Universidad de Buenos Aires. Avda. San Martin 4453 (1417). Argentina. Plant
Dis. 89:207, 2005; published on-line as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-0207A. Accepted
for publication 28 Nov 2004.

Canola (_Brassica napus_) is a developing oleaginous crop grown commercially
in Argentina. During 2003, typical symptoms of a foliar disease were
observed on canola plants in experimental field plots in Buenos Aires.
Average disease incidence across 14 6-month-old canola cultivars was 27
percent (range 12-42 percent). Climatic conditions in Buenos Aires during
August 2003 included moderate temperatures and periods with high humidity,
which were apparently favorable for disease development. Symptoms were
observed on leaves, stems, and pods.
Leaf symptoms were randomly distributed on the adaxial surfaces and
consisted of zonate lesions of alternating light gray and dark brown areas 6
to 10 mm in diameter. Remaining leaf tissue was chlorotic and affected
leaves abscised. Stem infections appeared as irregular and elongated black
lesions, 0.7 to 1.2 cm long. Pods lesions were circular, 6 to 8 mm in
diameter, gray in the center, and surrounded by a diffuse dark brown margin.
The disease developed progressively from the lower leaves to the pods,
resulting in premature senescence of the tissues, chlorosis, and
defoliation. Conidiophores bearing conidia colonized the lesions as a dark
gray growth of spore masses. Segments (0.5 cm long) taken from leaves,
stems, and pods of diseased plants were dipped in 70 percent ethanol,
surface sterilized with NaOCl (1 percent) for 2 min, and rinsed in sterile
water. Each segment was blotted dry and placed on potato dextrose agar.
Plates were incubated in the dark at 25 deg C for 2 to 3 days, followed by
incubation under NUV light and a 12-h light/dark photoperiod for 6 to 8 days.
6 fungal isolates were obtained. Fungal colonies were pale gray with dark
concentric rings. Conidia were yellow to pale brown, ellipsoid to ovoid,
produced singly or in short chains, with 8 to 10 transverse septa and 2 to 6
longitudinal septa. The spore body measured 13 to 22 x 68 to 135 micrometers
with a beak cell 42 to 101 micrometers long. On the basis of conidial and
cultural characteristics, the fungus was identified as _Alternaria
brassicae_ (Berk.) Sacc. (1). Koch's postulates were completed for 3
isolates by spray-inoculating foliage of 6-week-old canola plants of cvs.
Caviar, Dunkeld, Eclipse, Impulse, Mistral, and Sponsor with a conidial
suspension (100 000 conidia per ml).
The experiment, which included 4 inoculated plants and 2 noninoculated
control plants for each cultivar per isolate, was conducted in the
greenhouse at 22 to 24 deg C and maintained at 75 percent relative humidity
with no supplemental light. Inoculated and control plants were covered with
polyethylene bags for 48 h after inoculation. Within 12 days, inoculated
plants developed small, brown lesions on leaves and stems for all 3
isolates; the pathogen was successfully reisolated in all instances. Control
plants, inoculated only with sterile distilled water, remained symptomless.
The experiment was repeated with similar results.
The results suggest that _A. brassicae_ may be a threat to the main
cultivars being grown in Argentina. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report
of _A. brassicae_ causing gray leaf spot of canola in Argentina.

[There are 2 types of canola, the short-gr
owing season Polish type (_Brassicae rapa_ and _B. campestris_) and the
longer-season Argentine type (_B. napus_). Canola is produced extensively in
Europe, Canada, Asia, Australia, and to a limited extent in the United
States. Gray leaf spot [also known as black spot], caused by _Alternaria
brassicae_ and _A. raphani_, is present in all canola and rapeseed
production areas. The disease overwinters on plant debris and seed. All
above-ground plant parts are susceptible to infection from the spores
produced on plant debris or infected seed. Polish-type canola cultivars are
more susceptible than Argentine-type cultivars. Argentine varieties have a
higher yield potential and are also taller and have a higher oil content
than Polish varieties. Argentine varieties require about 95 days to reach
maturity, while Polish varieties need approximately 80 days to reach
maturity.
Disease management depends upon plant
ing certified, disease-free seed, a rotation of 1-4 years, and control of
weedy mustards and volunteer [self-sown] canola. It is most likely that the
introduction of grey leaf spot was the result of planting infested seed.
Fungicides containing iprodione and azoxystrobin are registered for control
of gray leaf spot on canola, but I do not know if they are recommended for
use in Argentina. Using fungicide-treated seed may help to increase stand
establishment when infected seed is planted.
