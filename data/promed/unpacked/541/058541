In the USA, we have been tracking Song Bird Fever episodes through
Cornell's Feeder Watch Program. Beginning in 1988, we had large
die-offs of migratory songbirds throughout the northeast USA
extending up into the Canadian Maritime provinces over time.
The next documented Song Bird Fever epidemic occurred in 1998; each
of these outbreaks involved thousands of dead birds and hundreds of
sick domestic cats. All of the deaths were due to _S._ Typhimurium
that was not multidrug resistant and was probably facilitated by
individuals feeding songbirds too late in the spring (i.e., feeding
was not really necessary at the time of year) and the feeders only
helped to transmit it to subsequent waves of migratory songbirds. Now
here is the interesting part: the moribund songbirds were easily
captured by the household cat who then transmitted it to the
household; we have limited evidence that this actually occurred.
We also suspect that _S._ Typhimurium was also spread to dairy
cattle in the northeast USA. The link to vegetables, at least in our
area, probably could not occur because at this time of year (early
spring) there are no vegetables in the garden. However, sometimes
these pandemic waves of _S._ Typhimurium have started in more
southerly states, and conceivably there could be fruit and vegetable
crops available for harvest in a warmer climate.

In 2000, house sparrow mortality associated with _Salmonella
enterica_ serotype Typhimurium definitive type 160 was initially
reported in Canterbury and then spread throughout most areas of New
Zealand. Isolations from birds, livestock, companion animals and
humans increased during late winter and spring. The organism was
isolated from the poultry environment, but did not cause disease in chickens.
All New Zealand isolates were indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis and antibiotic sensitivity. Canada, England & Sweden
have also experienced outbreaks of mortality in wild birds associated
with this phage type.
DT160 was not recorded in New Zealand prior to Nov 1998 in humans and
May 2000 in animals, but since then has become endemic and common.
The source of DT160 infection and routes of disease transmission for
birds, animals and humans has not been determined, although wild
birds have been incriminated as asymptomatic carriers of _S._
Typhimurium serotypes in many parts of the world. Further
investigations into the transmission, distribution of lesions and
disease progression of DT160 in house sparrows is to be published in
the December 2006 volume of the New Zealand Veterinary Journal.
