Hemorrhagic fever situation in Tatarstan worsens
------------------------------------------------
The hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) situation in
Tatarstan has worsened during 2008; 165 cases have been recorded so
far this year, and one person had died. According to the Russian
Epidemiological Surveillance System, last year 249 cases were
reported with 3 deaths.

HFRS is affecting cities like Kazan, Naberejniye Chelni and districts
like Agrizskiy, Almetyevskiy, Leninogorskiy, Nijnekamskiy,
Nurlatskiy, Pestrechinskiy, Ribno-Slobodskiy and Tyulaychinskiy. The
highest incidence of HFRS this year has occurred in June, when
increasing numbers of people go into their gardens and visit the
countryside and forests. The largest number of infections are
contracted in forests, and to a lesser extent in gardens.

In Kazan, the capital city, 52 cases of HFRS were recorded, the
majority contracted during visits to forest areas or in the gardens
of country dachas [cabins]. Field voles are the predominant source of this
infection in the region. The abundance of rodents in the forests
visited by the local inhabitants is a consequence of the volume of
discarded rubbish left behind.

[HFRS is endemic, not emerging, in the region, but is reported here
because all viral hemorrhagic fevers are Schedule A potential
bioterror agents. - Mod.JW

The fatality rate for HFRS varies from 1 to 15 percent. Treatment is
symptomatic and includes fluid transfusions and treatment of
secondary infection. Ribavirin can decrease risk of death. For
further information see:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/hfrs.htm>. - Mod.RS

The number of cases of HFRS in Tatarstan has risen from 65 to 165
since the previous report on 4 Jul 2008 (see reference below),
illustrating the scale of the problem.

Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is a group of clinically
distinct illnesses caused by several hantaviruses classified in the
family _Bunyaviridae_. Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is found
throughout the world. Haantan virus is widely distributed in eastern
Asia, particularly in China, Russia, and Korea. Puumala virus is
found in Scandinavia, western Europe, and Russia. Dobrava virus is
found primarily in the Balkans, and Seoul virus is found worldwide.
Hence it would be useful to learn the specific identity of the
hantavirus (and its vector) responsible for the hemorrhagic fever
with renal syndrome prevalent in the Republic of Tatarstan.
