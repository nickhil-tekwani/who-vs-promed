The number of cases of syphilis is rising in Germany -- particularly among gay men in urban areas, according to newspaper reports on Sunday. For years the illness was believed to have been under control in Germany, but new figures show a 22 per cent rise in the number of new cases last year compared with the previous year, wrote Die Welt on Sunday.

"We were very surprised, the numbers had been stable for the past years and in 2010 were even relatively low," Viviane Bremer, syphilis expert at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin told the paper. 3700 new cases were recorded in 2011, particularly in big cities such as Cologne, Frankfurt am Main, and Berlin.

"We don't know exactly why," said Bremer, who added that the rising numbers could be partially down to people more frequently getting themselves checked for sexually transmitted diseases. Gay men are particularly at risk of contracting the disease, said Bremer, but she does not believe this reflects any behavioural trends. "It's mainly men who have sex with men [MSM] who are affected," she told the paper. "But it would be speculation to conclude from that that reckless behaviour is becoming more widespread."

The problem is that although condoms can help protect against the disease, syphilis causes boils and lesions on the skin that are highly contagious. "Condoms are important, but they don't give 100 per cent protection," said Bremer.

German health campaigners are particularly concerned by the links between HIV and syphilis and are calling for educational campaigns to encourage people to get tested more frequently. Those who often have different sexual partners should have a blood test once or twice a year, Armin Schafberger of the Deutsche Aids-Hilfe health organisation told the paper.

Modern medicine can deal with syphilis much better than in the past, when patients were treated with injections of poisonous mercury. Now, if caught early enough, the bacterial illness can be treated with penicillin.

[After a period of low syphilis incidence during the 1990s, the incidence of syphilis began to increase nationwide in Germany in 2001 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=2759). However, the German syphilis notification system changed in 2001 from physician to laboratory-based reporting (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15677854).

Nevertheless, the increase is reported to reflect both an actual rise in the number of syphilis cases, as well as the change of the reporting procedure (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=494). The increase has been continuous since the introduction of the new reporting system, with only a very slight increase in the number of participating laboratories; private practices and sexually transmitted infection clinics in affected areas report a significant increase in syphilis infections especially in men who have sex with men (MSM) since about the year 2000, while the incidence rates for women before and after 2001 are similar; and the steep increases in syphilis incidence rates among MSM in large cities are in line with the trend seen in other European countries and in North America (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=494).

The incidence rate for syphilis in men in Germany was nearly ten times higher than in women (7.5 cases per 100 000 compared with 0.8/100 000) in 2004 and the highest incidences were observed in the cities of Frankfurt (22.5/100 000), Cologne (20/100 000), and Berlin (19.5/100 000) (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=2759).

A high proportion of MSM diagnosed with syphilis are HIV positive (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=494). Ulcerative sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis increase transmission and acquisition of HIV infection sexually. There is an estimated 2- to 5-fold increased risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to that infection when syphilis is present (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-syphilis.htm).

Reported increases in the incidence of infectious syphilis among MSM have been attributed in part to "HIV prevention fatigue", which appears to limit effective condom use and to result in high-risk sexual behavior associated with use of drugs or the use of the internet, which can also lead to unsafe sex with multiple partners.
