The bird flu virus [avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus] has re-emerged.
The Specific Diseases and Isolation Team at Hasan Sadikin Hospital,
Bandung has confirmed a [human] case of influenza A/(H5N1) virus
infection in a resident of Holis Street, Bandung. The source of the
virus is unknown.

A spokesman stated that the team of doctors at the Sadikin Hospital
had received confirmation today [Wed 8 Dec 2010] from the Agency for
Health Development Research of the Ministry of Health in Jakarta,
which had examined a sample from the 21-year-old patient.

The patient has been undergoing treatment in an intensive care unit
since Mon 22 Nov 2010. On arrival, the patient was experiencing
severe pain, and according to a specialist in internal medicine, the
patient was exhibiting symptoms characteristic of bird flu patients.

The symptoms of people with bird flu, following the incubation period
of 1-7 days, are similar to those of patients suffering from upper
respiratory tract infection; namely, high fever up to temperatures
beyond 38 C, sore throat, headache, sudden weakness, and in the most
serious cases, pneumonia. The initial symptoms resemble those of the
common cold.

The patient's condition has now gradually improved and assisted
respiration has been terminated. The patient now has no fever and is
lucid and with only a residual cough. When the patient's breathing
becomes normal, the patient will be discharged.

The team of doctors has not been able to confirm the source of the
infection. But according to the team leader, the patient had been
fond of eating cooked chicken. Bandung City Health Department
officials and the local Community Health Centre who have monitored
the patient's living quarters and surroundings have not discovered
anything that might be the source of the virus. On Wed 8 Dec 2010,
the Head of the Disease Monitoring service stated that none of the
patient's relatives, other house occupants and neighbours had
contracted avian influenza virus infection. No poultry were kept in
the patient's house, and there had been no sudden deaths of poultry
in the vicinity of the patient's home.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[This 2nd report on the bird flu-positive patient in Bandun, West
Java, provides an interesting account of the patient's progress. In
contrast to most reports of human infection with avian H5N1 influenza
virus, there has been no known contact with diseased or healthy
domestic fowl. There is no evidence of transmission of the infection
to other humans.

This case, when officially confirmed, will represent the 171st human
case of avian A/(H5N1) virus infection to have occurred in Indonesia
since the outbreak began in 2005, and the 9th in 2010.
