ECDC [edited]
https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-ebola-virus-disease-outbreak-north-kivu-and-ituri-provinces

[...]
According to the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Operations (ECHO), as of 9 Sep 2018, 2009 contacts have been identified (685 in Mabalako, 595 in Beni, 170 in Mandima, 89 in Oicha and 289 in Butembo) and 75.1 percent of contacts were followed up. [...]

Additional cases in Butembo city would be of concern as this city has more than one million inhabitants, and it is a commercial and travel hub between DRC and Uganda. So far, 2 probable cases and 1 confirmed case have been reported in Butembo as of 8 Sep 2018. This situation has the potential for new chains of transmission if not rapidly controlled. In addition, the implementation of outbreak control measures may be affected by the security situation and the humanitarian crisis in the North Kivu province.

According to WHO, the large number of internally displaced persons and the influx of Congolese refugees in neighbouring countries pose a risk factor for transmission of the virus at national and regional level.

The risk of introduction of the virus via an infected traveller to the EU/EEA is considered very low at this stage; see ECDC's rapid risk assessment [Citation. European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Ebola virus disease outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo - 9 Aug 2018. Stockholm: ECDC; 2018].

- 10 Sep 2018. Ebola: Outbreak in DR Congo claims 90 lives
BBC [edited]
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-45473046?ocid=socialflow_twitter

New cases of Ebola in urban areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo show the outbreak is not yet under control.
The charity Oxfam says that the next few weeks are critical to contain the virus, which has claimed 90 lives since 1 Aug 2018.
[...]

The epicentre of the recent outbreak is the densely populate town of Mangina.

"While the transmission rate appeared to be slowing down due to communities responding quickly to prevent the spread, these new cases in urban areas mean we're not out of the woods yet," says Jose Barahona, Oxfam's country director in DR Congo.

"It's also of real concern that 3 cases of the virus were found in a place where armed groups are highly active. These are hostile groups who don't negotiate, and our ability to reach people in need is extremely challenging."

The charity is concerned that fear is making some people take huge health risks.

"Some people are avoiding taking sick family members to Ebola treatment centres because they see them as prisons or places of death," says Mr Barahona. "A significant number of people who have been in touch with someone contagious have fled their homes and, in some cases, people are resisting handing over bodies of their deceased loved ones, making the threat of the virus spreading much more acute. People are facing the virus for the 1st time, so they are understandably shocked and scared. If you add in the appearance of health workers in space-age hazard suits and the fact they've been living with the threat of violence for decades, you can imagine how terrifying the situation is."

The photographer John Wessels documented the personal accounts of some of those affected by the new outbreak.

[The accounts of community members affected by Ebola by photographer John Wessels put a human face on the outbreak that the case numbers can't do alone. It is worth reading these brief accounts to get a sense of how people's lives have been disrupted by Ebola, notably loss of family, loss of income, loss of hope for a future, and a pervading sense of isolation. - Mod.LK]

[2] Challenges in region
- Tue 11 Sep 2018. Security problems in DRC: Workers attacked, supplies destroyed by Beni youth
Africa Times [edited]
https://africatimes.com/2018/09/11/ebola-in-dr-congo-workers-attacked-supplies-destroyed-by-beni-mob/

The race to contain the Ebola virus in Democratic Republic of Congo took a difficult turn Sun [9 Sep 2018] as a team of health workers was attacked in Beni, adding to the security and access concerns for workers in the volatile North Kivu province.

Officials say a team's vehicle was attacked by angry youths in the Butanuka neighborhood while the workers were taking a victim for burial. A mob also damaged supplies in a different part of Beni.

The city's acting mayor, Modeste Bakwanamaha, condemned the act, according to Congolese media.

No one was seriously injured. Yet security for health workers, and safe access to affected communities in the North Kivu and Ituri conflict zones, has been a serious concern for the World Health Organization and the DR Congo Ministry. That concern is shared by international NGOs and local staff trying to contain the deadly Ebola outbreak.

A million residents are displaced in conflict zones, and in some cases, workers require armed escorts to access those in medical danger. There is also the additional threat that those fleeing violence may head for nearby Uganda, Tanzania and Burundi, taking the infection with them, said Dr. Peter Salama, the WHO deputy director-general for emergencies.

"On the scale of difficulty, trying to extinguish a deadly outbreak pathogen in a war zone" is as hard as it gets, he said in August 2018, warning that the response will be "a very, very complex operation."

As of Mon's [10 Sep 2018] update from the Ministry of Health, the Ebola case total has reached 132, with 101 confirmed infections and 31 probable. A total of 91 people have died.

Most of the fatalities have been in Mabalako, where 63 people have died. The fatalities rose to 19 in Beni, with the remaining cases spread across 6 other communities. Nearly 8000 people have now been vaccinated, most of them in Mabalako and Beni.

- 11 Sep 2018. Oxfam: fear and violence could still undermine efforts to contain Ebola in DR Congo
Oxfam [edited]
https://www.oxfam.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2018/09/fear-and-violence-could-still-undermine-efforts-to-contain-ebola-in-dr-congo

[Byline: Sarah Dransfield]

[...]
In Mangina, the epicentre of the outbreak where over 80 percent of fatalities have occurred, Oxfam found people in shock and angry that family members have died so quickly and are being taken away from them.

Whilst the majority of people were aware of the seriousness of the virus and have been making great efforts to break the chain of contamination, those who didn't know about Ebola, were scared and had heard many rumours.

Amongst the daily incidents of low-level violence, Oxfam staff heard of some instances where fear had resulted in aid workers being threatened by angry people brandishing machetes and wooden sticks, rocks being thrown at cars, and health workers being blamed for killing family members. In one village, part of a health-screening checkpoint was burnt down, and Oxfam staff witnessed residents of another village create a roadblock, preventing any help from getting through.

Oxfam is already helping over 138 000 people, by providing clean, safe water and working with local community leaders and volunteers to increase understanding of how to prevent Ebola, to dispel any myths and fears people have.

Barahona said: "From working on previous Ebola outbreaks, it is clear that talking with communities and finding safe solutions with them is critical to containing the virus. When people are informed, and time is taken to listen to their concerns and questions, their behaviour changes rapidly. We have to work with people to change their understanding and behaviour if we hope to keep Ebola under control. These people have lived for years with conflict, and no one has reacted. Now they are seeing loved ones taken away and not buried as customs demand. Much more needs to be done to ensure that the whole response listens to the concerns of the communities."

[This report by Oxfam is a good analysis of how to quell the fears of the people in the communities affected for the 1st time by Ebola. Namely, the recognition that listening to the concerns of the community must be an integral part of the response. People need to understand why personal protective measures must be adopted to protect themselves and their families, why burials must be conducted safely and not as they were prior to Ebola. This is a cultural shift and clearly is very difficult. If the people in the communities are part of a discussion on these matters, it will be more successful than having outsiders come in fully gowned in protective gear telling them what to do. - Mod.LK
