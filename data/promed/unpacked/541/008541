Anthrax scare has gripped in [Similipal Tiger Reserve] and its neighbouring areas after an elephant died due to the dreaded bacteria.

The blood test performed by Animal Diseases Research Institute (ADRI) at Phulnakhara area in Cuttack [district, Odisha] confirmed the presence of anthrax organism in the pachyderm, forcing the veterinary and wildlife officials to conduct a vaccination drive in the neighbouring areas of the reserve.

Notably, 6 pachyderms have died in the Core area of the tiger reserve during the last 2 years, out of which 2 have died of anthrax, said Similipal Tiger Reserve Project joint-director Ajit Satpathy.
