Sierra Leone's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Kisito S. Daoh, has been
alerted of a reported case of yellow fever [YF] in the Bo district
[Southern Province] and laboratory tests conducted have confirmed
evidence on 2 patients following results from the Institut Pasteur
Laboratories in Abidjan and Dakar.

Yellow fever is a viral disease found in tropical regions of Africa.
It principally affects human and monkeys, and is transmitted via the
bite of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitos. It can produce devastating
outbreaks, which can be prevented and controlled by mass vaccination
campaigns.

Meanwhile, all District Medical Officers and their team have been
requested to sensitize their various communities and educate them on
the prevailing situation.

The Ministry of Health and Sanitation has intensified surveillance in
the country and there are plans to immunize all residents of Bo
district excluding pregnant women and children under 9 months.

The public is advised to stay calm as there is no cause for alarm.
The Government of Sierra Leone with support from the world Health
Organisation and other partners are in full control of the situation.

The public should note that yellow fever is spread by mosquitos. You
can protect yourself and your family if you:
* Always sleep under an insecticide treated bed net
* Report all cases of fever and yellowing of the eyes to the nearest
health facility immediately

[Since _Ae. aegypti_ bites during daylight hours, including dawn and
dusk, when most people are not asleep under bed nets, other measures
need to be taken to avoid infection as well. Elimination of water
catchments in and around houses and other buildings is important for
YF virus vector control.

It is hoped that the district medical teams are urging citizens to do
this, as well as implement the critically important YF virus
vaccination campaign. The Bo district had a population of 472 919
inhabitants in 2004. Bo is the 2nd largest city in Sierra Leone,
after Freeport, the capital. If Bo has large populations of _Ae.
aegypti_, as seems likely, occurrence of YF virus transmission in the
area is worrisome. _Aedes_ spp. other than _Ae. aegypti, are involved
in YF virus transmission in rural agricultural and in forested areas
in Africa. YF has occurred in other countries in West Africa in 2008,
but this is the 1st report from Sierra Leone for the year.

In August 2003, the health ministry reported one confirmed case and
45 suspected cases of yellow fever in the Tonkolili district,
Northern Province.

Between 7-10 Aug 2003, there was a joint investigation mission from
the ministry, WHO and UNICEF that collected samples on site and took
them to the laboratory for testing while surveillance was
strengthened.

In September [2003], one month later, the ministry reported a total
of 90 cases from 8 districts: Tonkolili, Bombali, Kenema, Koinadugu,
Porto Loko and Kambia in the north and Kono in the eastern province
[Only 7 districts are listed - Mod.LM].

Of the 90 cases, there were 4 laboratory confirmed cases, all from
Tonkolili district, and 10 deaths.

Over the last 20 years, the number of yellow fever epidemics has
risen, and more countries are reporting cases.

Mosquito numbers and habitats are increasing. In both Africa and the
Americas, there is a large susceptible, unvaccinated population.
Changes in the world's environment, such as deforestation and
urbanization, have increased contact with the mosquito/virus.

Widespread international travel could play a role in spreading the
disease. The priorities are vaccination of exposed populations,
improved surveillance and epidemic preparedness.
