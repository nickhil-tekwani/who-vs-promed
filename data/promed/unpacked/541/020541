Influenza update number 146
----------------------------
Summary
-------
- Influenza activity in the temperate regions of the northern
hemisphere remains low or undetectable.
- Low level influenza activity is reported in the tropical zone in a
few countries of the Americas (Cuba, Dominican Republic, and
Honduras), central Africa (Cameroon), and Southern and Southeast Asia
(Cambodia, Thailand, Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Viet Nam).
- Transmission in South Africa and South America remains low.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
The countries in the northern hemisphere temperate zone are still in
their inter-seasonal period for influenza. The majority of the
countries in this zone reported low or no influenza activity, although
sporadic influenza virus detection has been reported in recent weeks.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------

In the tropical countries of the Americas, generally low levels of
influenza transmission were reported. In the Caribbean, low level
transmission of different influenza viruses has been reported in the
Dominican Republic (influenza type B) and Cuba (influenza A(H3N2))
both of which experienced transmission peaks 2 to 3 months earlier. In
Central America, Honduras, and El Salvador have both reported recent
peaks in transmission of influenza A(H3N2), which is now decreasing.
Nicaragua, however, has reported recent sharp increases detection of
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 with a total of 199 cases confirmed between mid
to late September and mid to late October 2011. Panama, has been
consistently reporting low numbers of H1N1pdm since late June 2011
with a peak occurring in August 2011. Other Central American countries
and countries of the tropical area of South America have reported low
or undetectable levels of influenza transmission.

In sub-Saharan Africa, influenza transmission has generally remained
low with the exception of Cameroon where influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and
type B has continued to co-circulate at peak levels in recent weeks.

Low levels of influenza transmission have continued to be reported in
tropical Asia following transmission peaks that occurred one to 2
months ago. Transmission of influenza A(H3N2) peaked in India,
Bangladesh, and Thailand in the period from late July 2011 (India and
Bangladesh) to early September 2011 (Thailand and Lao People's
Democratic Republic) but was followed by a secondary increase in
influenza type B circulation. Small amounts of influenza type B has
continued to be detected in the area since. Notably, surveillance in
flood shelters of central Thailand, where large areas have been
flooded, reported influenza-like illness (ILI) to be the predominant
illness detected. The influenza surveillance systems in the country
have recently reported large numbers of H3N2 and influenza type B
detections. In contrast to the other countries of southern Asia, Viet
Nam continues to report sustained transmission of influenza
A(H1N1)pdm09 with much smaller numbers of influenza type B, which has
been continuous since the beginning of 2011, and Cambodia reports an
almost even mix of influenza type B and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
South America

- Temperate South America circulation of influenza viruses (snapshot)

In the temperate regions of South America influenza transmission
continued to decline, approaching intra-seasonal levels. Small amounts
of influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 co-circulate in Chile, while
influenza transmission in other countries in South America continued
at low or undetectable levels.

Southern Africa
- Southern Africa circulation of influenza viruses (snapshot)
http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/2011_11_04_influenza_southern_africa_circulation_main.pdf

Influenza transmission in South Africa has continued at low levels
since peaking in early June 2011.

Australia, New Zealand, and South Pacific

- Oceania Melanesia and Polynesia circulation of influenza viruses
(snapshot)
http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/2011_11_04_influenza_oceania_circulation_main.pdf

Influenza activity continued to decrease in Australia and New Zealand
with the season appearing largely over. However, there are regional
variations in timing and differences in subtypes. In New Zealand, the
rate of national ILI consultations decreased to 10.7 per 100 000
patient population (39 ILI consultations), with the ILI consultation
levels being maintained below the baseline. In New Zealand in 2011,
1269 influenza viruses were confirmed: influenza type B (594),
A(H1N1)pdm09 (108), A(H3N2) (430), and influenza A (not subtyped)
(137). The circulating influenza strains are covered by the current
influenza vaccine.

Globally influenza transmission remains low or undetectable. No novel
strains have made an appearance. A notable observation is that
surveillance in flood shelters of central Thailand, where large areas
have been flooded, found influenza-like illness (ILI) to be the
predominant illness detected. - Mod.CP]
