Canine Flu outbreak in Denver
---------------------------------
Veterinarians are battling an outbreak of canine flu in Denver that's
stricken dogs in 25 states.
The flu cannot be passed to humans or other kinds of animals, but
humans can carry it on their clothes to other dogs. The flu usually
runs its course in 2 to 3 weeks, but some states are reporting
deaths. The flu sometimes leads to pneumonia.
Edward Dubovi, Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine,
says the most seriously affected areas in the United States are
Denver, Miami and New York City. Vets around the country are taking
extra precautions.
Canine influenza was 1st identified in 2005. Since it is so new,
most dogs don't have natural immunity to the virus. Symptoms include
sneezing, coughing, and fever. If you think your dog has canine
influenza, contact your vet.

[Being aware of the multiple ways this disease can be transmitted is
the 1st step to stopping the transmission. It is quite possible that
we will be hearing about more deaths in the Colorado area. - Mod.TG]
