Bulletin: Cholera and AWD outbreaks in Eastern and Southern Africa, regional update for 2019 -- as of 16 Apr 2019
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Highlights
----------
Almost half of the countries in Eastern and Southern Africa region (ESAR) have been affected by cholera outbreaks since the beginning of 2019. More than 8258 cholera/AWD [acute watery diarrhoea] cases including 29 deaths have been reported in 10 countries in the region, with an average case fatality rate of 0.4%, since the beginning of 2019. These countries include Angola, Burundi, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Somalia, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Mozambique accounts for 69.5% (5656) of the total case load reported this year [2019], followed by Kenya at 16.3% (1350).

Currently 5 out of the 10 countries with reported cholera/AWD outbreaks in ESAR since week 1 of 2019, have active transmission and they include; Mozambique, Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Malawi. During the week under review, Mozambique reported the highest number of new cases (1584 cases). Of the countries with active transmission, Tanzania has recorded the highest case fatality rates (CFR) in 2019 at 1.6%.

Mozambique: a new surge in the disease has produced roughly a cumulative total of 5656 reported cholera cases including 8 deaths in a span of 3 weeks (from week 13 [week ending 31 Mar 2019] to week 15 [week ending 14 Apr 2019]). These cases emerged from 4 districts affected by Cyclone Idai: Beira, Dondo, Nhamatanda, and Buzi. A 47.6% decrease in the weekly incidence has been noted in the last 2 weeks. During week 15, 1584 new cases including 1 death (CFR, 0.06%) were reported compared to 3024 cases including 6 deaths (CFR, 0.2%) reported in week 14 (week ending 7 Apr 2019). The emergency cholera vaccination campaign which ended on 10 Apr 2019 covered 98.7% (814 293 people) of the targeted population in four districts affected by Cyclone Idai.

Somalia: an increase in the epidemic trend has been noted in the last 2 weeks. During week 13 [ending 31 Mar 2019], 40 new cases were reported from Banadir region compared to 32 cases reported in week 12 (week ending 24 Mar 2019). Cumulatively a total of 707 cases with no deaths have been reported since the beginning of 2019. Children under 5 years bear the brunt of the cholera outbreak, representing 45% of the total case load reported in both epidemiological weeks 12 and 13 [18-31 Mar 2019]. During the week under review, the most affected districts in Banadir were Hodan accounting for 25% (10/40) of the total number of cases reported during week 13, followed by Daynile accounting for 22.5% (9/40).

Kenya: in reporting week 15, 132 new cases including 1 death (CFR, 0.8%) were reported from 3 counties -- Nairobi (102), Kajiado (24), and Garissa (6); compared to 14 cases reported during epidemiological week 14. Since 1 Jan 2019 to 16 Apr 2019, cholera outbreaks have been reported in Narok, Kajiado, Nairobi, Garissa, and Machakos counties with a cumulative total of 1350 cases including 6 deaths (CFR, 0.4%). Of these 72 were confirmed positive.

Malawi: from weeks 13 to 15, 5 confirmed cases of cholera were registered in 3 districts: 1 in Nsanje from TA Tengani, 2 in Mchinji, and 2 in Mwanza. There is confirmed evidence of cross-border transmission with Mozambique. The Mwanza district cases had history of travel from Moatize, Tete province in Mozambique where they experienced symptoms. The outbreak was first detected on 30 Mar 2019. The index case started having signs of watery diarrhea and vomiting on 29 Mar 2019 on their way back to Malawi from Moatize district in Mozambique. Following investigations the index case was confirmed positive. The second case from Moatize in Mozambique turned positive by RDT at Mwanza Hospital in Malawi on 12 Apr 2019. This was a 20-year old Malawian national (female) who lives with her husband in Moatize, she developed symptoms on 9 Apr 2019, before she started traveling to Malawi. This case also tested positive for _Vibrio cholera_ by culture.

Tanzania: 11 new cases were reported from Tanga region during epidemiological week 15, bringing the total number of cases reported since the beginning of 2019 to 190 cases including 3 deaths (CFR, 1.6%)

Urban-rural disaggregation of cholera cases
Overall, more cholera cases emerge from urban areas (77.6%; 5711) as compared to rural areas (22.4%; 1648). This is according to an analysis of cholera cases reported since the beginning of 2019 from seven countries (Angola, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe). Of the total number of cases reported in urban areas (5711), Mozambique accounts for the majority (92.65%; 5291), followed by Kenya (5.22%; 298), Uganda (0.93%; 53), Tanzania (0.84%; 48), Angola (0.33%; 19), Malawi (0.02%; 1), and Zimbabwe (0.02%; 1). All cases reported in Uganda (53) and Angola (19) emerged from urban areas. Apart from Mozambique, Uganda, and Angola; collectively, the remaining 4 countries (Kenya, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and Malawi) have more cholera cases emerging from rural areas (78.7%; 1283) as compared to urban areas (21.3%; 348).

[2] Kenya (Nairobi): hospital spread

Staff dies as cholera outbreak hits The Nairobi Hospital
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A male worker died on Tuesday morning, 16 Apr 2019 after what his colleagues said was "a short illness."

Sources at the hospital told the Nation that at least 23 cases of the water-borne disease, 8 involving staff, had been treated at the facility in April 2019 alone. The hospital's cafeteria has been closed indefinitely as the management battles to contain the spread of the outbreak. A source privy to the information and who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to issue press statements said they have been treating cholera cases on a daily basis.

"The hospital has been handling cholera cases day in day out but now there is an outbreak and the staff are affected. We are treating it seriously. The investigation is on," said the source. But in a statement, the hospital's management on [Tue 16 Apr 2019] denied any internal outbreak, meaning the cases could have come for outside. "There is an upsurge of cholera cases in Nairobi. We have had several cases admitted in our hospital. Unfortunately, we had 8 of our staff affected," said the statement. It continued: "There is no outbreak of cholera in the hospital. No patient is at risk and we are continuously monitoring."

Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017, pp 113-136:

"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 percent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.

"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:
- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;
- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65% (95% CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;
- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).

In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).
