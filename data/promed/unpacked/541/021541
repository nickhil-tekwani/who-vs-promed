I would like to respond to the posting [Norovirus - USA (multistate)
20070112.0145] in which the moderator wonders if the attention for
noroviruses is reflecting media hype or something else. I would like
to remind the moderator (and the readers) of a posting from December
2006 (Norovirus, increased activity - Europe 20061214.8255).
This was a report from our European norovirus research and
surveillance network in the December issue of Eurosurveillance. Here
we reported increased activity of norovirus associated with emergence
of a new variant of GGII4. This genotype is the most common norovirus
found in institutional outbreaks, and evolves quite fast.
We have seen 3 pandemics of GGII4 new variants in the past 10 years,
and probably are witnessing the 4th one. Reasons for this rapid
evolution are not clear, but suggest selective advantage of the new
viruses, possibly immune escape. This is currently under
investigation in our network.
The new variants first were detected in the spring of 2006, when
several cruise ships sailing across Europe reported norovirus
outbreaks. Contacts with groups in HongKong and Australia confirmed
their presence in those parts of the world as well. The European CDC,
following the report of the investigation, called an expert meeting
to discuss the situation. A report is available on the ECDC website
(<http://www.ecdc.eu.int/publications/tehnicalreport> dated 12 Sep 2006).
Virologists across the world can access the rapid genotyping tool on
our website to check if the viruses that they have identified match
with the new variant strains. (see <http://www.rivm.nl/bnwww>; go to
foodborne viruses in Europe, choose quicktyping tool). We have sent
CDC US this information. We have not seen any sequence data from the
US, but my guess would be that they are looking at the same variant.
I hope this helps to put things into context.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Koopmans for the clarification
and the reminder of the emergence of a new variant of the GGII4
strain of norovirus in Europe this year. This moderator had chimed
in as an "agent-provocateur" by adding the following comment to the
posting, in the hopes of eliciting a response from knowledgeable
sources about the norovirus activity in the USA this year: "Either
the newswire agency are more sensitive to reporting on norovirus
outbreaks this current "winter season" or there is a real increase in
norovirus activity." More information on the norovirus activity in
the USA from knowledgeable sources, especially information on the
strain(s) involved would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
