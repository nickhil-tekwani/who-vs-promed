China finds suspected H5N1 outbreak among ducks
-----------------------------------------------
China has discovered a suspected outbreak of the H5N1 bird flu virus
among ducks in an outlying district of the southern metropolis of
Guangzhou, the Agriculture Ministry said on Saturday [15 Sep 2007].
The ministry said on its Web site that by Thursday [13 Sep 2007],
9830 ducks had died of the outbreak in Guangzhou's Panyu District.
Initial tests by provincial officials showed that the birds had died
of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, which can be transmitted to
humans, the ministry said.
They had submitted samples to a national laboratory for further
testing, it said, adding that authorities had culled nearly 33 000
ducks to contain the outbreak.
With the world's biggest poultry population and millions of backyard
birds roaming free, China is at the centre of the fight against bird flu.
There have been 25 human cases, including 16 deaths, from the virus
in China and dozens of outbreaks in birds that have led to the
culling of millions of fowl.
