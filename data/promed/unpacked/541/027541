[1] Cholera - Angola

Angola has reported a total of 30 612 cases and 1 156 deaths (case
fatality rate (CFR) 4 percent) from 19 Feb to 8 May 2006. Of these
cases, 50 percent have occurred in Luanda province (CFR 1 percent),
25 percent in Benguela province (CFR 7 percent), 10 percent in
Malanje (CFR 6 percent) and Kuanza Norte (CFR 5 percent) provinces. A
further 5 other provinces have reported between 3 and 155 cases with
a CFR ranging from 1-33 percent.
The peak of the outbreak occurred 3 weeks ago in Benguela and Bengo
provinces. However, in the other provinces the outbreak has just
started or is still spreading.
The Ministry of Health has established a provincial task force,
including WHO, UNICEF, International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies (IFRC), Medecins sans Frontieres (Spain, Holland,
France and Switzerland) and Medecins du Monde (MdM), to plan and
coordinate the response to the outbreak in Luanda Province.
WHO is assisting the task force and has provided 7 tons of emergency
supplies for the immediate response. Furthermore, an epidemiologist,
a public health specialist and a water and sanitation engineer have
been dispatched to support control activities in the field.
Control activities are difficult in view of the precarious water and
sanitation situation, particularly in urban areas and Luanda Province.

situation and leading to a significant increase in daily cases.
Through Government and WHO surveillance 76 500 cases are estimated to
occur between Apr and Sep 2006.
Province / Cases (last 24 h) / Deaths (last 24 h) / Cases (13

Affected communities need treatment centers, safe water, excreta

and information on preventative behaviour and the need to seek care
early on.
Since 13 Feb 2006, UNICEF, WHO, the Ministry of Health (MoH) and
other key implementing agencies, have supported a response to cholera
Angola. The National Cholera Task Force, meets every day and,
sub-groups meet for affected provinces, case management, case
surveillance, safe water, and social mobilization. Surveillance is
ongoing to monitor the spread of the outbreak, predict its movement
and identify its sources.
Cholera treatment centers have been established in affected areas
with provision of medical supplies and technical guidance.
Water chlorination is in place for populations in affected areas,
coupled with provision of distribution points.
Capacity building of health staff in all provinces to provide
effective treatment for current and potential cases.
Social mobilization in affected and non-affected provinces providing
information on awareness of cholera, and how to prevent and treat it,
reaching more than 850 000 people nationwide.
In non-cholera affected provinces UNICEF is working with the
provincial governments to develop plans of action to minimise the
risk of cholera entering those provinces and the impact if it does.

[5] Dysentery - Kenya (North Eastern Province)
Date: Fri, 12 May 2006
From: S K Sharif <sksharif@ikenya.com>
11 cases of deaths due to dysentery have been reported by the Ministry of
Health in Kenya. The deaths occurred in Kotulu area in El Wak division of
Mandera District in North Eastern Province. The total number of cases of
dysentery reported were 37.
The initial laboratory results indicate bacillary dysentery; further results
are being awaited. The samples had to be taken to Nairobi since there are no
laboratory facilities in the district. The outbreak started around 3rd week of
Apr 2006. The team investigating the outbreak has identified a water pond
as the source of the outbreak. The water pond was used as the source of
drinking water, washing and was also used by animals.
The area has been affected by a prolonged drought followed by excessive
rainfall. Most of the deaths occurred at homes and the nearest health facility
reported only 1 death. The high case fatality may be explained by the poor
nutritional status due to the prolonged drought in North Eastern Province.

Delhi has reported 222 cases of cholera in the last 4 months and
authorities here blame it on the poor quality of drinking water.
"The capital has reported 222 cholera cases as against 92 in the
corresponding period in 2005. But we are not triggering the warning
bell as the situation is well under control," said N.K. Yadav, deputy
municipal health officer of Delhi.
"Waterborne diseases may be common in summer, but the poor drinking
water quality is a major reason for the number of cases. We are
working in collaboration with the Delhi Jal Board to deal with the
situation," Yadav told IANS.
