[The problem with Vesicular stomatitis is twofold. One, there is
inevitably a disruption of production in cattle; not only will the sick
animal produce less, but disease management tactics must be very stringent.
The second problem is that the symptomatology is similar to that of foot
and mouth disease (FMD), with which it can easily be confused (though
horses are resistant to FMD and susceptible to VS). In this case, the
diagnosis of the disease in an equine first forestalls any worry about FMD.
According to the OIE, symptoms can be summarized as follows:
- excessive salivation
- blanched raised or broken vesicles of various sizes in the mouth:
Horses: upper surface of the tongue, surface of the lips and around
nostrils, corners of the mouth and the gums
Cattle: tongue, lips, gums, hard palate, and sometimes muzzle and around
the nostrils
Pigs: snout
- Lesions involving feet of horses and cattle are not exceptional
- Teat lesions occur in dairy herds
- Foot lesions and lameness are frequent in pigs
- Recovery in around 2 weeks
- Complication: loss of production and mastitis in dairy herds due to
secondary infections, lameness in horses
Unfortunately, this outbreak continues and -- typical of major outbreaks of
VS -- has some teeth. An outbreak began in Texas in May of 2004 (see the
Texas Animal Health Commission website at
<http://www.tahc.state.tx.us/animal_health/diseases/vs/vs.shtml>).
The current outbreak began in April of 2005 and as of April 2006, there
were 445 premises infected with 27 in Arizona, 100 in Colorado, 2 in Idaho,
46 in Montana, 3 in Nebraska, 23 in New Mexico, only 1 in Texas, 104 in
Utah and 139 in Wyoming. So clearly this outbreak is widespread in the
North American west, centering on the high plains states of Utah, Wyoming
and Colorado. Excellent information can be found at the USDA-APHIS website
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/nahss/equine/vsv/index.htm> and maps
portraying the distribution of cases in the west can be found at
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/nahss/equine/vsv/vsvmaps/US_2005_Cumulative_Final_041406.pdf>.
The last major outbreak of Vesicular stomatitis in the Western United
States was in 1997 and 1998, confined to Arizona, Utah, New Mexico and
Colorado. - Mod.PC]
