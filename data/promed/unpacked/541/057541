Anthrax Found on Connecticut Letter
-----------------------------------
Traces of anthrax were found on a letter in Connecticut for the first time
Friday, and the governor said that suggests that the 94-year-old woman who
died mysteriously of the disease last week might have gotten it from her
mail after all. [However Gov. John Rowland said no direct connection had
been made between the letter found at a home in
Seymour and the death Nov. 21 of the Connecticut woman, who lived about a
mile away in Oxford. But Rowland suggested that her mail - like the Seymour
envelope - may have been contaminated in the postal system by
anthrax-tainted letters sent to Sens. Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy in
Washington.
Authorities described the Seymour letter only as a personal piece of mail
that was processed at the Hamilton facility near Trenton, N.J., on Oct. 9.
They did not disclose details about its postmark or any addresses. The
letters sent to Daschle and Leahy were postmarked at the Hamilton facility
on Oct. 9. Rowland said the Seymour letter moved through a sorting machine
within seconds of one of the Washington letters. The Washington letters are
blamed for contaminating a number of Washington buildings and for killing 2
postal workers.
Using envelope bar codes, authorities said they had determined that a small
amount of mail for the Oxford area passed through the Hamilton facility.
None of the letters went to the deceased Connecticut woman, but Rowland
said her mail might have come in contact with the letters and received a
trace of anthrax spores. "Supposition on my part is that [she, at age 94,
had an immune system far less than yours or mine, and that you and I could
have handled her same piece of mail and not gotten sick," he said.
Investigators continue to look for any similarities to the baffling case of
a 61-year-old New York City woman who died Oct. 31, also from the inhaled
form of anthrax. Both women lived alone.

Update: Investigation of Bioterrorism-Related Inhalational
Anthrax---Connecticut, 2001
---------------------------------------
On November 16, a 94-year-old woman who resided in Oxford, CT (2000
population: 9821), presented to a local hospital with fever, cough,
weakness, and muscle aches of approximately 3 days' duration. She had no
history of chills, headache, rhinorrhea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal
or chest pain. She had a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, hypertension, and renal insufficiency. On admission, the patient
had a temperature of 102.3 F (39.1 C) with an elevated heart rate and room
air oxygen saturation of 93 percent. Physical examination was otherwise
unremarkable. Initial chest radiograph had no evidence of pulmonary
infiltrate, pleural effusion, or widened mediastinum. Her white blood cell
count was 8100 cells/mm3 (78 percent neutrophils, 15 percent lymphocytes).
Hematocrit, platelet count, and electrolytes were normal. Blood and urine
cultures were obtained and the patient was admitted for dehydration and
possible urinary tract infection.
On November 17, gram positive rods were noted on microscopic evaluation of
the blood culture and gram negative rods were isolated from the urine.
Antibiotic therapy was initiated for possible sepsis with vancomycin and
ceftazidime, and changed to ampicillin/sulbactam and oral ciprofloxacin
later that day. On November 18, the patient had progressive respiratory
distress and confusion. Repeat chest radiograph revealed a left-sided
pleural effusion and possible infiltrate but no mediastinal widening. A
chest CT was not performed. Thoracentesis performed the following day
obtained 800 ml of serosanguinous fluid with 4224 red blood cells and 1463
white blood cells. On November 19, the patient was transferred to the
intensive care unit and required mechanical ventilation and vasopressor
support. Clindamycin was added to her antibiotic regimen, and ciprofloxacin
was changed to intravenous administration. The patient's condition
deteriorated, and she died on November 21.
On November 19, the Connecticut Department of Public Health (CDPH) was
notified by the hospital of the positive blood culture results. On November
20, the isolate was identified as _B. anthracis_ at the CDPH laboratory
with confirmation at CDC the following day. The _B. anthracis_ isolate was
indistinguishable by molecular typing and antibiotic susceptibility
patterns when compared with the strain from recently identified cases of
bioterrorism-related anthrax. An autopsy revealed hemorrhagic mediastinal
lymphadenitis with positive immunohistochemical staining for _B. anthracis_
on spleen and mediastinal lymph node tissue.
The patient lived alone in a rural area of CT and was homebound except when
provided transportation by friends and family. Interviews with family
members and others were conducted to construct a time line of the patient's
activities during the 60-day period preceding her illness. The time line
was used to guide environmental sample collection. As of November 27, none
of the environmental samples from the patient's home, local businesses, and
other areas that she frequented has yielded _B. anthracis_. In addition,
nasal swabs from friends and relatives who may have had common exposures
with the patient were negative for _B. anthracis_. These persons were
started on ciprofloxacin or doxycycline for postexposure prophylaxis. The
decision whether or not a full 60-day course is necessary will be made
after further investigation into the potential source of exposure.
On November 20, environmental testing was conducted at the local post
office and regional mail distribution facility involved in delivery of the
patient's mail. In addition, sampling was performed on mail recovered from
the patient's home, area mailboxes, and the mail carrier vehicle. As of
November 27, none of the samples have yielded _B. anthracis_. Nasal swabs
also were taken from 460 postal employees in the two facilities; all are
negative for _B. anthracis_. Mail flow investigations have identified
several letters that were delivered to the area serviced by the patient's
local post office and that had previously passed through the mail facility
in Trenton, NJ, shortly after the _B. anthracis_ contaminated letters
addressed to two U.S. Senators. However, no such letters are known to have
been received by this patient. On November 21, approximately 900 postal
employees at 2 facilities in CT were started on either ciprofloxacin or
doxycycline, pending the results of further investigation.
Surveillance for new and possibly undiagnosed anthrax cases is being
intensified by contacting hospitals, laboratories, physicians, and by
reviewing death certificates. Environmental and case investigations to
identify a source of _B. anthracis_ exposure are ongoing.
[It is interesting to note that the deceased Connecticut woman had a prior
medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and
renal insufficiency, which presumably directly affected her susceptibility
to such an infection when exposed. - Mod.MHJ

Update: Adverse Events Associated with Anthrax Prophylaxis Among Postal
Employees --- New Jersey, New York City, and the District of Columbia
Metropolitan Area, 2001
----------------------------
Antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent inhalational anthrax has been
recommended for persons potentially exposed to _Bacillus anthracis_ as a
result of the recent bioterrorist attacks (1). During October 26--November
6, 2001, an epidemiologic evaluation to detect adverse events associated
with antimicrobial prophylaxis was conducted among 8424 postal employees
who had been offered antimicrobial prophylaxis for 60 days in New Jersey
(NJ), New York City (NYC), and one postal facility in the District of
Columbia (DC). This report summarizes preliminary results of that
evaluation, which found that few employees receiving antimicrobial
prophylaxis sought medical attention for symptoms that may have been
associated with anaphylaxis. Persons with exposures to _B. anthracis_
related to the bioterrorist attacks should complete the full 60-day course
of antimicrobial prophylaxis.
In NJ, NYC, and DC, a questionnaire was administered on days 7 to 10 after
postal employees received prophylaxis (when they returned for medication
refills). In NYC and DC, the questionnaire was self-administered by postal
employees; in NJ, nurses interviewed postal workers and administered the
questionnaire. Information was collected about the type of antimicrobial
used, the occurrence of adverse events, medical attention sought for
adverse events related to antimicrobial prophylaxis, and discontinuation
of prophylaxis. Persons who reported hospitalization or sought medical
attention for symptoms that may have been associated with anaphylaxis
(i.e., difficulty breathing; throat tightness and difficulty swallowing;
swelling of lips, tongue, or face; and rash, hives, and itchy skin) are
being followed up closely by contacting patients and clinicians to confirm
or exclude possible hospitalizations and life-threatening adverse events.
Of the 8424 postal employees offered antimicrobial prophylaxis, 5819 (69
percent) completed or were administered the questionnaire to evaluate the
occurrence of adverse events. A total of 3863 (66 percent) had initiated
antimicrobial prophylaxis*; of these, 3428 (89 percent) reported using
ciprofloxacin for antimicrobial prophylaxis; 435 (11 percent) used other
antimicrobials (when ciprofloxacin was contraindicated), including
doxycycline (6 percent) and amoxicillin (1 percent) (Table 1). Of the 3428
persons on ciprofloxacin, 666 (19 percent) reported severe nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain; 484 (14 percent) reported fainting,
light-headedness, or dizziness; 250 (7 percent) reported heartburn or acid
reflux; and 216 (6 percent) reported rashes, hives, or itchy skin. Of those
persons taking ciprofloxacin, 287 (8 percent) discontinued the medication;
116 (3 percent) discontinued the medication because of adverse events, 27
(1 percent) discontinued because of fear of possible adverse events, and 28
(1 percent) stopped taking the drug because they "did not think it was
needed." For the 3863 persons on any medication for antimicrobial
prophylaxis, 83 (2 percent) sought medical attention for symptoms that may
have been associated with anaphylaxis. Among the 33 persons who sought
medical attention for these symptoms in NJ and NYC, none was hospitalized
and none of the symptoms was attributed to antimicrobial prophylaxis by
clinicians who evaluated these persons. Follow-up of persons in DC who
sought medical attention for symptoms that may have been associated with
anaphylaxis is ongoing.
Editorial Note:
Among persons with exposures to _B. anthracis_ related to the recent
bioterrorist attacks, completion of a full 60-day course of antimicrobial
prophylaxis is essential for preventing anthrax (1). Activities to promote
adherence among postal employees in NJ, NYC, and DC include messages (e.g.,
posters at the worksite) to promote adherence, small group discussions with
postal employees to identify and resolve barriers to adherence, and
reminder devices (e.g., pocket calendars). In addition, a key component of
promoting adherence is monitoring adverse events that might deter patients
from taking antimicrobial prophylaxis. Information from these monitoring
systems can be used to reassure workers of antimicrobial prophylaxis and to
guide management of workers with potentially serious adverse events.
Although adverse events were commonly reported by postal employees who
participated in this evaluation and included gastrointestinal and
dermatologic reactions, only 2 percent of persons surveyed sought medical
care for symptoms that may have been associated with anaphylaxis. Overall
rates of adverse events (regardless of attributability) in NJ, NYC, and DC
are similar to the frequency of adverse events among other persons on
antimicrobial prophylaxis for exposures to _B. anthracis_ related to these
bioterrorist attacks (2) and among persons on ciprofloxacin therapy for any
indication (3,4). The higher rates of adverse events in NJ compared with
NYC and DC (p=0.001), may be explained by the different mode of
administration of the questionnaires (nurse versus self-administered).
Discontinuation of therapy caused by adverse events was similar to other
groups previously studied (5). Both active and passive monitoring of
adverse events and promotion and assessment of adherence to prophylaxis
will continue for the duration of the recommended postexposure prophylaxis.
