PRO/AH/EDR> Duck viral enteritis - UK: (England) swans, susp, RFI
-----------------------------------------------------------------
In response to the recent posting (subject as above) and RFI, we are
pleased to be able to provide the following:

During winter 2011 more than 150 Mute Swans (_Cygnus olor_) died on
the River Thames due to infections, probably exacerbated by the severe
weather experienced in the UK at that time.

A swan rescue organisation and representatives of Her Majesty The
Queen found carcases at a number of locations along the River Thames
between January and March 2011.

Post-mortem examinations and other associated laboratory
investigations performed by the Animal Health and Veterinary
Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) on 40 swan carcases confirmed several
diagnoses, including Duck Virus Enteritis (DVE) and Necrotic
Enteritis. No evidence of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI) virus infection was detected.

Interested readers are directed to a summary of this and other mass
mortality incidents in wild water birds in England where there were
associations with the prolonged freezing weather during winter 2011
(Duff and others, 2011). These investigations concluded that the
deaths were probably due to a wide range of infectious and
non-infectious causes and starvation. A number of other Mute Swan
mortality incidents have also been investigated in different locations
in Great Britain during this winter. DVE was diagnosed from a number
of these cases following post-mortem examination and virus isolation.

Mass mortality incidents are rarely associated with a risk to human
health, but it is important that H5N1 HPAI virus infection is
excluded, as in these cases. Continued reporting and investigation of
mass mortality events is important to understand the causes and to
ensure that any potential risk to public or animal health is
detected.

Information about reporting mass mortalities of wild birds in Great
Britain can be found at:
http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/ai/wildbirds/survey.htm.

In addition, details of laboratory confirmed cases of DVE in
waterfowl are available in previous 'Wildlife Disease in the UK'
reports to the OIE. These are available on the VLA website:
http://vla.defra.gov.uk/reports/rep_wildlife.htm. DVE is recorded
in 2005 (page 34), 2006 (page 44) and 2007 (page 20).

The AHVLA's investigations were performed as part of the Defra-funded
AHVLA Diseases of Wildlife Scheme and the avian influenza wild bird
survey, part of the Great Britain Wildlife Disease Surveillance
Partnership:
http://vla.defra.gov.uk/reports/rep_surv_wildlife.htm. [The Jan-Mar
2011 report, indeed including data on the identification, in dead
swans, of DVE among other agents, is available at
http://vla.defra.gov.uk/reports/docs/rep_survrep_qtlyw0111.pdf.
