RE: Bali is rabies-free
On what do you base your advice that Bali is rabies-free?

In reply to the comment from Linda Selvey that "there is no rabies in Bali
and so rabies post-exposure prophylaxis is not required", I say that it
would be a brave practitioner who did not give rabies post-exposure
prophylaxis to bitten travellers returning from Bali. To consider a
country rabies free, one needs to be assured that the animal importation
and surveillance policies of the territory are adequate to prevent and
detect any new clinical cases.
Rabies is present in Java (WHO, World Survey of Rabies 1995), yet little
information is provided by authorities on the numbers and types of cases.
Given the proximity and amount of boat traffic to Bali, I would be
surprised if the Balinese are able to police their border in regards to dog
or wild animal movement. The paucity of disease data for Indonesia in the
OIE publication, "World Animal Health in 1996" similarly does little to
provide confidence that surveillance in Bali is able to provide an accurate
picture of current rabies status, or swiftly detect and report any new cases.
