On Wed 26 Dec 2012, the health minister of Central Darfur announced that new cases of yellow fever have been registered in the state. However, Issa Mohamed Moussa Yousef explained that all patients come from the gold mining area of Jebel 'Amer, North Darfur and stressed that Central Darfur has not recorded any new cases of the disease in more than 2 weeks.

Speaking to Radio Dabanga, the minister disclosed that one person died of yellow fever in the Roakirro locality and that another 5 people are infected; 4 of them are hospitalized in Zalingei, and the other case is being treated in Wadi Saleh. This brings the total yellow fever death toll to 83 and the number of infections to 443 [for Central Darfur], Yousef pointed out.

The minister said that vaccination campaigns have been completed in the localities of Mukjar and Bindissey and added that the 3rd phase of the campaign is about to be finalized in the Umm Dukhum locality.

Ishaq Ahmed Yaqoub, health minister of West Darfur, announced the "end of yellow fever" in the state. [But see ProMED comment below].

He spoke with Radio Dabanga from the state's capital, El-Geneina, and asserted that West Darfur has not recorded any new cases of yellow fever for 3 weeks. Nevertheless, the minister expressed concern about other diseases affecting the population, such as diarrhea, bronchitis and viral hepatitis.

In Central Darfur, Yaqoub suggested that most yellow fever cases are coming from Jebel 'Amer.

In the meantime, Ahmed al-Tayyeb, minister of health of South Darfur, announced the launch of the 3rd phase of the vaccination campaign in the state, which will incorporate the remaining localities in the state by the end of this month [December 2012].

The minister explained to Radio Dabanga that the 2nd phase of the campaign is scheduled to be completed by 27 Dec [2012], and that by then, 70 percent of the localities should have been covered.

According to al-Tayyeb, a total of 20 people have died of yellow fever in South Darfur, and 174 were infected. He pointed out that these figures were collected more than 2 weeks ago.

[One hopes that the Central and West Darfur health officials are correct and that the yellow fever outbreak is ending there. It does seem premature to declare the end of yellow fever in West Darfur until more time has elapsed with no new locally acquired cases. The control efforts are now at a stage where extensive surveillance is necessary to find any new cases with rapid follow up to vaccinate individuals in those localities. Passive surveillance, by awaiting new cases to appear in hospitals and health centers, may not be adequate to detect new cases in areas where villages are remote and roads nonexistent.
