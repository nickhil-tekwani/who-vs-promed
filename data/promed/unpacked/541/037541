Deadly fungus spreads to 9th North American bat species
-------------------------------------------------------
The deadly fungal infection that afflicts bats known as white nose syndrome
(WNS) has now been found on another US bat species, the 9th since the
infection was first observed 4 years ago. According to the Center for
Biological Diversity, WNS has now beset 20 per cent of North America's bat
species.

WNS's latest victim is the southeastern myotis (_Myotis austroriparius_),
which lives in the Gulf Coastal Plain and the lower Mississippi Alluvial
Plain. An infected myotis bat was found in Virginia's Pocahontas State Park
in May [2010]. It died soon after it was captured by the Virginia
Department of Game and Inland Fisheries. The fungus that causes WNS grows
on bats' facial skin and flight membranes, possibly causing them to starve.
In caves where it has been observed bats have suffered morality rates
ranging from 75 to 100 per cent. It has killed at least one million bats
and spread throughout the eastern US since the fungus was first observed in
New York State in 2006. WNS was also recently discovered in Ontario and
Quebec. Caves in many states have been closed to prevent humans from
possibly further spreading the fungus.

Scientists still do not know what causes WNS, nor how to prevent or cure it.

This remains an elusive disease for scientists to tease out its secrets and
find a way to protect our bats. So the news on the WNS front continues to
be grim. - Mod.TG]
