In the current 2010 season, soft rot infections (_Erwinia_) were
reported to be widespread in potato crops. The presence of soft rot
pathogens may lead to a latent risk for harvested crops. Therefore
damage of tubers intended for storage should be avoided at all costs.
Affected tubers must be eliminated carefully and measures for quality
assurance during storage should be given special attention.

[Bacterial soft rot of potato can be caused by _Pectobacterium
carotovorum_ subspecies (previously _Erwinia carotovora_) or
_Dickeya_ species (previously _Erwinia chrysanthemi_). Symptoms due
to _Dickeya_ spp tend to appear later in the season.

Soft rot is favoured by warm and humid conditions. Symptoms include
brown spots on the tuber surface which will turn into a cream
coloured rot that rapidly destroys the tuber. Soft rot may be
confined to lenticels (surface pores of tubers). Infected lenticels
appear slightly sunken, tan to brown and water-soaked. Under dry
conditions, lenticel infections may dry up leaving a small pit, but
harvesting potatoes under wet conditions will increase the risk of
soft rot expanding in storage.

The bacteria are spread with contaminated plant or other materials,
by mechanical means, and water. Fungal pathogens may increase the
risk of secondary soft rot, or additional pathogens may invade soft
rot affected tubers through skin lesions. Disease management includes
seed tuber handling and cultural techniques, use of clean planting
material, and phytosanitation to prevent introduction of the
pathogens from external sources.

Blackleg disease of potato is caused by the related _Pectobacterium
carotovorum_ subsp. _atrosepticum_, and a very virulent form which
has recently emerged is caused by the new species _Dickeya solani_.
