The cumulative number of cholera cases in South Sudan since the start of the outbreak has risen to 1106. Medical reports suggest that the outbreak is being contained in some areas, while in others, new cases have been found.

According to UN Humanitarian Coordinator Toby Lanzer, the number of cases as of this morning [2 Jun 2014] was 1106. He said cases have now been confirmed also at Kajo Keji and Yei in Central Equatoria, and at Kaka in Upper Nile State.

A situation report by the Ministry of Health and World Health Organization on Saturday [31 May 2014] found that the cumulative number of cases as of the end of the day on Sat 31 May 2014 was already 1078, with 27 fatalities, while another 896 patients were discharged after successful treatment. This means that about 28 new cases were recorded between midnight Saturday and early Monday [2 Jun 2014], in other words in a period of just about one day.

Last week, the number of cases in Northern Bari Payam, hitherto one of the most affected neighborhoods, declined compared to the previous week. But the number of cases remained high in Munuki and also rose significantly in Rejaf payam. Gumbo area in Rejaf payam, which is on the east bank of the Nile just opposite from Juba, saw 164 suspected or confirmed cholera cases between 23 Apr and 31 May 2014.

Health officials say that those who contract cholera typically have been drinking from unsafe water sources, eating foods sold on the roadside or at makeshift markets, or practicing poor hygiene.
