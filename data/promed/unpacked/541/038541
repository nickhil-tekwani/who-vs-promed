Officials Following Up on Bacteria Detection
---------------------------------------------
City and county health officials are following up on the detection by
air sensors of low levels of parts [probably DNA fragments. -
Mod.JW] of the bacterium that causes tularemia, a treatable illness
occasionally found in humans but more common in rabbits and
rodents.

Health officials said that though the bacteria are found naturally in
the environment, precautionary measures are being taken to
determine whether there have been any human cases of tularemia,
commonly known as rabbit fever, in the area. So far none have
been found. Low levels of the organism were detected by
laboratory tests done on filters taken from special air monitors on
Sat, Sun and Mon, 4-6 Oct 2003. However, filters tested from the 2
following days were negative.

"The new technology in use throughout Houston and Harris County
gives us information that was not previously knowable. We are
investigating to determine whether the bacteria were always
present or newly present and whether they represent a health
threat to the community," said M. desVignes-Kendrick, MD, MPH,
Director of the Houston Department of Health and Human
Services.

Precautionary measures being taken by the City of Houston's
Health and Human Services Department and Harris County Public
Health and Environmental Services include increased surveillance
for human illness, additional environmental sampling, collection and
testing of wild rabbits and rodents, and an assessment of activities
in the area that may have caused the sensors to pick up the
organism. Officials are concentrating on an area of Houston and
Harris County from Greens Bayou on the east, the Houston Ship
Channel on the south, and the Hardy Toll Road on the west.

"The Harris County and Houston health departments are pooling
resources and expertise to investigate the potential impact of the
findings. We greatly appreciate the ongoing collaboration and
support we receive from our partners in the local medical
community and local, state, and federal agencies," says Herminia
Palacio, MD, MPH, Executive Director of Harris County Public
Health and Environmental Services.

The air sensors are part of a nationwide BioWatch system
inaugurated in March 2003 to monitor for intentionally released
bacterial agents but may detect naturally occurring organisms.

Health officials say there is nothing to indicate an intentional
release of the organism but that the investigation is continuing to
see whether a naturally occurring explanation for the sensor
detection can be identified.

[Although neither human cases nor an animal outbreak are reported
here, it seems noteworthy, as this is likely to be only one of many
reports regarding the use of air sensing hardware to detect
evidence of infections classified as potential biological warfare
agents such as the tularemia bacillus. The BioWatch program is
summarized in the article below. - Mod.LL]

BioWatch program aims for nationwide detection of airborne
pathogens
<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/bt/bioprep/news/biowatch.html>
-------------------
26 Feb 2003 (CIDRAP News) - Typical predictions about what
would happen in a bioterrorist attack with airborne germs say that
no one would know about it until a number of people with similar
symptoms starting showing up in clinics and emergency rooms. But
the federal government is hoping to change that scenario with its
new nationwide program to sniff the air for dangerous pathogens.
The "BioWatch" program is an ambitious effort to sample the air in
major metropolitan areas daily for pathogens that terrorists might
use, according to federal officials. Testing equipment is being set
up in 20 metropolitan areas, according to a Department of Health
and Human Services (HHS) public relations spokesman in
Washington, DC. An air monitoring program used during the 2002
Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City was the prototype for the system.

"The ultimate goal is to deploy these in various cities so that 80
percent of the American population by geographic distribution will be
living in areas that will be covered by this equipment," the HHS
spokesman, who asked that his name be withheld, told CIDRAP
News. The system involves the installation of special paper filters
on existing Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) air-quality
monitoring stations, the spokesman said. Plans call for removing
each filter every day, taking it to a laboratory, and using a
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis to test it for pathogens
that terrorists might use.

"Early detection is the key to getting a jump on a biological
incident," said the HHS official. "They'll be collecting these
filters daily, 7 days a week." He said that from the time a filter
reaches the lab for analysis, it will take from 3 to 8 hours to rule
out pathogens or identify one, depending on what it is.

Federal officials say the initial focus of the monitoring includes a
short list of agents that terrorists are considered likely to use. The
HHS spokesman said the laboratories involved, all part of the
CDC's Laboratory Response Network, can test for a wide variety
of pathogens, and different labs might look for additional
pathogens. Each urban area will have 10 to 12 air monitoring
stations, the HHS spokesman said. He said 40 million dollars have
been earmarked for the program for fiscal year 2003, enough
money to deploy the sampling equipment in the 20 cities and cover
some additional expenses.

Officials involved with BioWatch acknowledge that the system's
existence prompts tough questions about what to do when
pathogens are found. How will authorities know if a positive finding
is a true-positive? If it is a true-positive, how can analysts assess
whether it represents an isolated natural event or a terrorist attack?
And if the finding does seem to represent an attack, how should
authorities respond?

While offering few details, the HHS spokesman said authorities in
the various cities are working on plans for responding to any
findings that indicate a real danger. "In each of the local
metropolitan areas they've set up a working group with the local FBI
office and they're working on a game plan on how they're going to
handle the analysis that comes out of the system. Each of the
areas is going to be doing some tabletop exercises to practice how
they'll handle it when they get results they need to act on."

The public health laboratory director in one of the states affected
said the possibility of false-positives is a big concern. "When we
apply these kinds of tests, we'd like to be able to culture the
organisms as well," to confirm any positive results, he said. But this
isn't a good option because the air sampling units use high-speed
airflow that would tend to kill most organisms through shearing
forces and drying, he said. Spore-forming organisms [such as
anthrax. - - Mod.JW] would probably survive, but most others would
not, he said.

Also complicating the picture is the natural occurrence in some
areas of pathogens that terrorists might use. A positive test result
might be accurate without being evidence of a real problem. "A lot of
factors would have to be taken into consideration" in interpreting a
finding, the laboratory director said."The last thing you'd want to
happen would be to put out a false alarm."

The air monitoring program during the 2002 Winter Olympics
[produced] one episode that gave a preview of the kinds of
questions that can arise, according to Scott Williams, MD, deputy
director of the Utah Department of Health. Williams said the
program involved 15 to 20 monitoring stations scattered over a
large area centered on Salt Lake City. The filters were removed
every 4 hours and tested for the presence of pathogens in the
CDC's category A. The lab analysis began with a screen for a
single strand of DNA, he explained. If that test was positive, a
second single-strand test was done; a second positive finding
prompted a confirmatory test looking for 4 different DNA strands.
The lab analysis was handled by the US Department of Energy
(DOE), which developed the special PCR tests involved.

"There was one event that created sort of an initial posturing of
response," Williams said. On 12 Feb 2002, a sample collected at
the airport came up positive on more than one single-strand test.
"We alerted the airport that they may need to evacuate," he said.
But officials decided to wait for the confirmatory test before taking
that step. That turned out to be the right move, because the
confirmatory test showed that the microbe was a cross-reacting
organism, a nonpathogenic one with a DNA strand that matched a
strand in one of the pathogens being sought, Williams said.
(Officials never were able to identify the organism; it was assumed
to be "just an endemic organism that happened to share that single
strand," he noted.)

Before the alarm was called off, the airport started preparing to
close, and hazardous-materials teams were suiting up for possible
duty, Williams said. "It was interesting because it created all of the
scientific and political response processes. . . . It was the most
realistic tabletop exercise you could have conducted."

Williams said Utah health officials took some lessons from the
episode. In the interest of quicker confirmation or rejection of
positive test results, "We recommended to DOE that they change
the [PCR testing] process so that they always run the 4-strand
confirmatory test simultaneously with the 2nd single-strand test."

The event also pointed up the importance of tabletop exercises
simulating this type of scenario. "We did a lot of tabletop exercises
before the Olympics, but we never specifically mock-exercised the
air monitoring event," Williams said. "We were able to create a
good decision process as we went, but it wasn't as comfortable as it
could've been."

Also, even with careful planning, potential threat situations
inevitably involve people who never participate in tabletop
exercises, he added. "So we realized that what you need is a very
rapid briefing process for these people, so they're not trying to
figure out what you're talking about while they're trying to make a
decision about whether to close the airport."

HHS and the CDC are the lead agencies on the BioWatch
program because it's a bioterrorism issue, according to the HHS
spokesman. "But we couldn't have done it without the DOE's
assistance with the filters and the testing, and EPA has been key in
getting it set up and collecting the filters," he said.

"It's going to be very labor-intensive," the laboratory director said
in describing the effort. "It'll also be very routine, until you get a
positive."

[The principal means of transmission of tularemia is by the bite of a
tick infected from a wildlife reservoir. Rabbit & rodent hunters also
contract it when skinning wildlife. As far as is presently known,
natural aerosol spread occurs only in dust from fodder, grain or
wool contaminated with rodent excreta (Acha & Szyfres 1994, 2nd
edn., Zoonoses and communicable diseases common to man and
animals). - Mod.JW]
