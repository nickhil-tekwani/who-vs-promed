Born Free has welcomed the Zambian authorities' decision to suspend a highly controversial cull of 400 hippopotamuses a year over the next 5 years in the Luangwa River Valley, following a high-profile campaign led by Born Free and supported by international experts and Zambian nationals.

According to an official statement from the Zambian Department of National Parks and Wildlife (DNPW) the cull, which started last month, was being suspended to allow for further consultation with stakeholders. Born Free will continue to closely monitor events.

Born Free President and Co-Founder, Will Travers OBE, stated: "Leaving aside the ethical dimension - whether it is morally acceptable to kill hundreds of healthy animals to prevent a possible future outbreak of a disease -- other important questions remain to be answered. Is there an overpopulation of hippo and on what is this evaluation based? Is culling an effective anthrax control strategy and, again, where is the evidence?"

There has been widespread shock and outrage on social media since news of the cull was reported last week by Born Free. The distressing news made headlines across the world and may have prompted the decision of the authorities to suspend the cull.

Though the cull was reportedly sanctioned by DNPW as a "wildlife management tool" to prevent the possible future spread of anthrax among wild animals (although, for the 1st time, the DNPW is now claiming low river levels as a justification), the killing was opened up to non-Zambian trophy hunters. A 5-year hunting contract had been awarded to Mabwe Safaris, and was being marketed by a South African hunting company called De Marillac Safaris.

Travers added: "I sincerely hope that, on reflection, the DNPW will decide to permanently abandon plans for a cull. Were they to recommence the killing, without doubt there would be members of the safari-going public who would decide to spend their money elsewhere to view Africa's magnificent wildlife legacy."

A South African company is selling seven-day hippo hunting safaris for more than R180 000 in Zambia's Lupandi area, where conservationists say they've only just been told about a controversial cull okayed by the Zambian wildlife authority. There's no suggestion that Theo De Marillac Safaris is doing anything illegal.

The cull - reported to be of up to 400 hippos every year for the next five years - is officially to stop the spread of anthrax, an infection that can be fatal to humans. But the UK-headquartered Born Free organisation suggests that the cull is more about "trophy hunting" and says it will turn this 250km stretch of the Luangwa River into "killing fields".

Born Free claims on its Facebook page that Theo De Marillac Safaris is marketing the hunts. On its website, Theo De Marillac Safaris urges potential clients to "experience the rare and exciting opportunity of participating in a controlled hippo hunt in Zambia's Upper and Lower Lupandi". "This walk and stalk hunt over the flood plains means hippo are hunted on land, making this a very exciting, adrenalin-pumping safari," says the company. A five-day safari - which will see five hippo hunted - will cost R129 500 (US$8,500) while a seven-day safari, hunting seven hippo, will cost R181 300 (US$12,000).

Will Travers, Born Free founder, said in a statement: "At a time when wildlife populations of multiple species are under extreme pressure across much of Africa, many, including Born Free and our supporters around the world, fundamentally question the logic of killing thousands of hippo, and turning the flood plains of the Luangwa River Valley into 'killing fields'."

[Members should note this sentence: "A 5-year hunting contract had been awarded to Mabwe Safaris, and was being marketed by a South African hunting company called De Marillac Safaris." And draw their own conclusions about this whole affair. When river levels are low hippos have a propensity to graze further and further out, which would bring them into contact with villagers. And it also concentrates their numbers when in the water. There are some who doubt the simplicity of ascribing multiple hippo deaths to anthrax. So anyone investigating such an event should take great care to obtain suitable samples from as many dead hippos as they can for laboratory confirmation.
