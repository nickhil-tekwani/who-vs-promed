Epidemiological unit: backyard
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Rabbits / 1 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: non-commercial pet rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_)

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Rabbits / 100 / 100 / 100 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.

Epidemiological comment: This event involved a single case that affected one pet rabbit submitted to a local veterinary clinic.

["Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly contagious and acute fatal hepatitis of the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) caused by a calicivirus (genus _Lagovirus_). Up to 2010, all RHD viruses (RHDV) isolated belonged to one of the 6 identified genotypes (GI-GVI), among which the GVI is an antigenic subtype (RHDVa). In 2010, an additional RHDV was identified, phylogenetically and antigenically distinct from RHDV and provisionally called RHDV2 or RHDVb. A similar disease, termed European brown hare syndrome (EBHS), has been described in the hare (_Lepus europaeus_).

"RHD is characterised by high morbidity and a mortality of 70-90% for RHDV/RHDVa and 5-70% for RHDV2. Infection mainly occurs by the oral route. In wild rabbits in particular, insects are considered an important route of infection or transmission and are often the source of long-distance spread. The incubation period of RHD varies from 1-3 days, and death usually occurs 12-36 hours after the onset of fever. The main clinical manifestations of the acute infection are nervous and respiratory signs, apathy, and anorexia. In rabbits younger than 4-6 weeks, the RHDV/RHDVa infection course is subclinical, but when the causative agent is RHDV2, clinical signs and mortality are observed even in young animals from 15-20 days of age onwards."
