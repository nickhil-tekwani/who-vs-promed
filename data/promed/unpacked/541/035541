The report which documented the probable presence of West Nile virus (WNV)
on the South American mainland since 2004, based on the presence of
antibodies to WNV in the blood of 10 horses and 2 donkeys sampled during
September and October 2004, reported that antibodies to WNV were detected
in blood sera collected from 12 of 130 donkeys and horses from the
provinces of Sucre and Cordova in northern Colombia.
The original ProMED-mail report (West Nile virus, equines - Argentina (02)
20060425.1204) implied that the infection was detected in all 130 equines.
