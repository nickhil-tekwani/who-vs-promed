Abstract. Anthrax is an important disease caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_ affecting both domestic and wild animals at the wildlife/livestock interface, defined here as a physical space in which wild and domestic species overlap in range and potentially interact. In endemic regions, sporadic anthrax outbreaks occur, causing significant deaths of both wildlife and livestock and, sporadically, humans. However, it may also occur as isolated outbreaks with a few animals affected. Such isolated anthrax outbreaks maybe missed. High seroprevalence among carnivores suggests either regular non-fatal exposure to the pathogen circulating in a given environment or contact with missed cases through consumption of anthrax carcases. To investigate the relevance of this potential indicator, a cross-sectional study was conducted to determine anthrax seroprevalence in domestic dogs (_Canis lupus familiaris_) from selected interface and non-interface areas of Zimbabwe with known history of anthrax outbreaks. Based on past anthrax outbreaks in the respective areas, the sites were further classified as high- or low-risk areas for anthrax outbreaks. Sera were collected from domestic dogs (n = 186) and tested for antibodies against _B. anthracis_-protective antigens (PA) using an ELISA test. The overall seroprevalence was 51.6 percent (96/186; 95 percent CI 44.2-59.0). Sites from the non-interface areas recorded a significantly (P less than 0.001) higher (72.1 percent) anthrax seroprevalence compared with those from the wildlife - livestock interface (41.5 percent). The results demonstrated a strong association (chi square = 14.3; OR = 3.2, 1.6 less than OR less than 6.2, P less than 0.001) between anthrax seropositivity and interface type. Low-risk sites (42.5 percent) had a significantly (P = 0.044) lower seroprevalence compared with high-risk sites (58.5 percent) but still demonstrated high seroprevalence for areas where anthrax was last reported more than 20 years back. Dogs from Tsholotsho South were more than 90 times (OR = 96.5, 13.5 less than OR less than 690.8) more likely to be seropositive compared with those from Hwange. The study demonstrated the potential to use domestic dogs as indicators of anthrax in the study areas to survey anthrax circulation in supposed low-risk areas and calls for a redefinition of both low- and high-risk areas for anthrax in Zimbabwe based on an improved surveillance.

[This abstract is not clear on the meaning of interface and non-interface, but I suspect it refers to interaction or not between livestock and wildlife. If so, the higher seroprevalence in non-interface areas would reflect the dog's access to infected carcasses. Animals dying near a village are very likely to be promptly butchered, and the dogs would then have access to rejected viscera. Cattle in a wildlife interface would be quickly seized by scavengers, mammalian and avian, and thus canine access to the infected carcass would be less. But even in a low-risk area, the dogs had a 2-in-5 opportunity for frequent exposure. And if seropositive dogs in an area with 2 decades of no known cases and anthrax antibodies are short lasting -- remember that cattle have protection for only about 9 months following vaccination with Sterne -- that anthrax is common in Zimbabwe but poorly observed. And I very much doubt whether rural village dogs in Zimbabwe live much over 10 years, and certainly not 20 years.

This is a very interesting paper, and one can look forward to it being available for reading in full. In the meantime, seroprevalence of anthrax antibodies in dogs is a useful litmus test for the pathogen's presence or absence. - Mod.MHJ
