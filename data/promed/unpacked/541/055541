A case of human rabies last month [January 2011] in the Batopilas community from the bite of an infected skunk, according to comments by inhabitants of the area, was confirmed by the Secretariat of Health, after having captured the animal and made corresponding tests.

The traditional healer of this community, Mendoza Castillo, reported the case to El Diario, which stated that the man was attacked by the animal, an atypical case [for skunks] that usually defend themselves by urinating [sic. spraying from scent glands], not biting.

In this area, where 100 per cent of the inhabitants are indigenous people accustomed to hunting skunks for food (meat) and for some remedies [for problems] such as allergies, a warning was given to not eat them because they are infected by rabies [virus], Mendoza Castillo said.

Javier Valenzuela, spokesperson for the Secretariat of Health, confirmed that last month [December 2011] a case of human rabies occurred, who was attended to in a timely way by the brigade of physicians who went to this area. In these cases, the vaccine must be applied on the day of the bite and additional doses on the 3rd day [post exposure], the 7th day, the 14th day, and the last dose on day 21. [The WHO has reduced the number of recommended post-exposure vaccine doses from 5 to 4].

The people in this area know that if an animal that usually does not attack by biting, bites someone they must go immediately to a physician and get vaccinated, even though it is not confirmed that that the animal does or does not have rabies, and later the physicians test the animal that attacked to take appropriate measures.

Manuel Guizar Fuentes, subdelegate of SAGARPA [Secretariat for Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food], stated that they have a campaign operated by the state Committee for Promotion and Protection of Animal Industry, between SAGARPA and the Secretariat of Rural Development of the state government in coordination with the Secretariat of Health, for control of paralytic rabies in cattle in the mountain municipalities of Uruachi, Chinipas, Guazapares, Urique, Batopilas, Morelos, and Guadalupe y Calvo, in the canyon areas, in hot, humid climates. In this area, 70 000 vaccine doses are applied annually, free to [livestock] producers, purchased by SAGARPA and distributed among cattlemen, he indicated.

He commented that any producer who detects cattle with bites by [vampire] bats or by any other animals, must report it to the closest authority, in the Livestock Department of the municipal President's office, or any other health agency, because the municipalities, state government, and SAGARPA all work in coordination for the control of this disease.

The signs of an animal infected by rabies [virus] are excessive salivation and, for "derriengue" [vampire bat transmitted bovine paralytic rabies] ataxia [uncoordinated movement] when walking.

[Rabies in skunks is not unusual, but human cases from skunk bites are not a common occurrence. Skunk attacks are particularly dangerous because they tend to bite, hold, and chew, producing especially traumatic bites, and their saliva contains large amounts of virus, all of which facilitates transmission of the virus.

The campaign to vaccinate cattle apparently has nothing to do with the case of human skunk-origin rabies.

The initial foci of rabies were identified at the end of December [2011] in the city of Primeiro de Maio, with the deaths of 2 animals. This Thursday [19 Jan 2012], technicians of the Regional Nucleus of the state Secretariat of Agriculture and Food Supply (SEAB) confirmed the existence of 9 foci of the disease in the northern region of Parana: 3 in Primeiro de Maio, one in Bela Vista do Paraiso, another in Sertanopolis, and a 4th in the municipality of Florestopolis.

In order to contain the outbreak of the disease, the veterinarian of SEAB, Antonio Aparecido Reis, stated that the cattle raisers were notified to vaccinate their herds. "We drew a radius of 12 km [7 mi] around the focus and start spreading the news. In Bela Vista, for example, more than 200 bovines have now been vaccinated," he said in an interview with Radio CBN Londrina.

The vaccines must be obtained by the rural property owners. Each dose costs R 0.65 [USD 0.38]. It is necessary to apply 2 doses of the vaccine in order to guarantee the cure [prevention] of the disease in bovine, equine, caprine [goat], and ovine [sheep] animals. Up to the present, 9 animals died of the disease for which, according to Reis, no treatment was possible. He explained to the producers that it is necessary to maintain distance from ill [rabid] animals.

Up to now, no [cases] of the disease have been registered among the people residing in the north of the state. But, in order to avoid the occurrence of any cases, Health Surveillance of Bela Vista is going to initiate a vaccination campaign directed at domestic dogs and cats.

Meat from infected animals must not be eaten. [Although the risk of acquiring a rabies virus infection through eating meat from infected animals is negligible, it is never prudent to consume tissue from ill or dead animals. - Mod.TY]

[We all hope that there will be no cases in the north of the state. But for now, more effective than "orienting producers need to maintain distance from ill animals" is to encourage anti-rabies vaccination of those [animals] that potentially [could be] exposed. - Mod.RNA]

[The source of the rabies virus in these bovine cases is not specified. It likely is _Desmodus rotundus_, a common vampire bat that frequently transmits rabies virus in the American tropics, including Brazil. Vaccination of cattle herds in these areas is prudent.
