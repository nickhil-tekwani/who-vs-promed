A chicken from the San Gabriel Valley Mosquito and Vector Control
district tested positive for the West Nile Virus last month.
The chicken was part of the district's vector borne disease
surveillance system.
The chicken was discovered with antibodies of the West Nile Virus,
commonly known as WNV, and blood tests from the California Department
of Health Services and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory confirmed the results.
"Antibodies is the sign that the chickens are infected," said Kelly
Middleton, a spokeswoman for the San Gabriel Valley district.
The district keeps flocks throughout the city in order to prevent outbreaks.
"As part of the vector surveillance system, we keep 10 flocks of
chicken throughout the city," Middleton said.
The vector borne surveillance system is part of the district's
Integrated Pest Management program, also known as IPM.
According to the district's Web site, the IPM is responsible for
conducting "long-range and environmentally sound vector control."
The program includes the vector surveillance system, "breeding source
prevention and reduction, biological and chemical control, and public
education."
The chickens from the surveillance system are "tested every 10 days
for antibodies," Middleton said.
"Chickens don't die like other birds do; like crows, they develop
antibodies," Middleton said.
The chickens from the surveillance system are also used to test for
other diseases [viruses - Mod.TY] transmitted by mosquitoes such as
the St. Louis encephalitis and the Western equine encephalomyelitis.
Although the chicken was the only one in the area to test positive, a
great concern arose.
"WNV has potential to be year round," Middleton said. "We are doing
intense hunting trying to catch mosquitoes."
"People should not panic. Mosquito populations are low," Middleton
said. The district has used several methods to keep population levels low.
When the sites of standing water cannot be eliminated, the district
places artificial sites of standing water where mosquito fish are
released. Because the fish can only be released in artificial
standing water, the district uses pesticides to control population levels.
Although there have been no alerts of the West Nile Virus in the city
of La Verne, residents are encouraged to take all preventative
measures: Keep an eye out for standing water, keep pools and
fountains clean, use repellents, and always contact the district in
case of any suspicious activity.
