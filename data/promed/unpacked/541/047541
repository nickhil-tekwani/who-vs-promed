Suspected outbreak of malaria
-----------------------------
A disease suspected to be malaria rage in the area of Lake Munkamba,
territory Kabeya Kamuanga in Kasai-Oriental [province]. Several
children aged under 5 years have suffered from the disease. A total
of 30 deaths have been recorded since the onset 2 weeks ago.

A team of epidemiologists from the Provincial Health Office and the
World Health Organization (WHO) have visited the area, and on 13 Sep
2010 Kabeya Kamwanga announced the publication of his report in the
coming days. Children victims of the disease showed signs of acute
fever and vomiting a few hours before they died.

A team of experts was dispatched to Lake Munkamba, after this
information was brought to the attention of provincial deputies. On
site, emergency kits of drugs and compounds of sampling equipment has
been transferred.

The provincial Minister of Health suspects the presence of a form of
malaria in this part of the territory of Kabeya Kamuanga. The causes
of this disease, he said, could be environmental health hazards, the
straying of wild animals, and the lack of mosquito nets in the region.

In July 2010, other cases of malaria have claimed several lives in
the area of health Katako Kombe, in the same province of
Kasai-Oriental.

[Malaria is highly endemic in the area. It is unclear why the disease
should be malaria, and no mention of positive blood films for malaria
parasites have been mentioned. The presence of diarrhea as a key
symptom could point to a waterborne infection and an alternative.
Malaria in humans is not associated with a reservoir in wildlife and
the lack of bed nets in the area is probably not new. If it indeed is
malaria, the use of substandard or counterfeit drugs could explain a
surge in malaria deaths in an already highly endemic area.

ProMED will be happy to post further details. - Mod.EP]
