Mr. Honhold is correct. Our presumptions may mislead us. While we may
typically associate rodents with intensive farming (e.g., _Rattus_ sp.),
other rodents thrive in grassland areas using other food sources. The
Great Plains grasslands in USA is home for ground squirrels (e.g.,
_Citellus_ ) and prairie dogs (e.g., _Cynomys_). Are there any equivalents
in Mongolia?

[Given that there were rodents before there were farmers, I would have
suspected as much. Certain rodents prefer disturbed habitat, others do
not. All depends on the rodent. One may see lots of rodents in an
undisturbed, essentially bare ground but turn over a shovel of dirt, set
the grass on fire, build a house, and certain of the little buggers come
from all over to the party. My original statement was that when rodents
have access to more food there will soon be more rodents. I stand by that
statement. We must move away from thinking that rodents are "rats" or,
better but not good, "rats and mice". I am not getting back into the "a
rose is a rose is a rose" discussion but we cannot consider "rodents" as a
taxon any more than we can consider that all mosquitoes, flies, elephants,
or people are taxa. Diversity of speciation leads to and is the causation
of diversity of diet. What is good for one species may not be good for
another and one cannot at all generalize about rodents. I can say from
experience that western harvest mice do not give a tinker's dam about
farmers and their activities while deer mice do. - Mod.CHC
