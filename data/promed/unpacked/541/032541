This is to provide some clarification for the ProMED-mail posting
entitled: Tuberculosis, swine - USA (Ohio, West Virginia), dated 28
Mar 2006.
Regarding the _Mycobacterium_ species isolated from the
tuberculosis-affected swine discovered in West Virginia, Ohio, and
other states; submissions from suspect lesions were made to National
Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL), one from a private
practitioner following necropsy and the others from FSIS-inspected
plants in Ohio and Indiana.
_Mycobacterium avium_ was diagnosed in all cases as the etiologic
agent. _Mycobacterium bovis_ has not been isolated from hogs in this
or any other swine tuberculosis cases in the U.S. for many years.
_M. avium_ itself infects mainly birds and is found in the
environment. The organism is shed in large numbers via bird
droppings, making contaminated food or bedding a potent source of
infection. Pigs are rarely infected by the bovine organism (_M.
bovis_) but are commonly infected via environmental contamination by
the avian/intracellulare complex, which does not spread between pigs.
The national eradication program in the U.S. targets the zoonotic _M.
bovis_ organism only, making _M. avium_ infection mainly a
differential diagnostic rule-out, although _M. avium_ infected
carcasses will be trimmed and/or condemned for cooking.
