[3] USA (Texas): child exposure

The state of Texas has 1079 infections [now 1430 ] and officials there have revealed that a 2-year-old has the bug. It's not yet clear how the child contracted the virus as the little one does not attend nursery or school.

Medics in Harris County are undertaking contact tracing to find out who may have had direct contact with the child.

Judge Lina Hidalgo [County Executive] said the parents first noticed their child had a rash and took them to get checked out by a GP. Aside from the rash, the child has been asymptomatic, ABC13 reported.

Judge Hidalgo is now encouraging parents to be vigilant amid the current outbreak. "I understand that it's a very scary thing, and parents have concerns, and what we need to make sure is to be vigilant and understand the risks, not assume the worst. "But this reminds us that this is very real," she said.

The bug is more severe in young children and the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) has warned of preliminary evidence that has suggested children below the age of 8 could develop a more severe reaction to the virus.

Young children with eczema and other skin conditions, and children with immunocompromising conditions may also be at more risk for severe illness, according to the CDC.

The current assumption is that the child caught the bug through household transmission.

The latest case of the illness in a child comes after a study found that the virus can linger on surfaces touched by an infected person. Meaning the child could have contracted the bug if someone in their household had it.

Medics last week [week of 15 Aug 2022] also warned that the more cases that are identified -- the more likely it would be that children start to catch it.

https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/saude/brasil-tem-77-casos-de-monkeypox-em-criancas-e-adolescentes-conheca-os-riscos


Brazil has 77 confirmed cases of monkeypox in children and adolescents aged 0 to 17 years, an incidence of 3.5% of infections. Of these, 20 cases (0.6%) were identified among children aged 0 to 4 years.

So far, Brazil has recorded 3788 confirmed cases of the disease. The data were released by the Ministry of Health on Monday [22 Aug 2022].

Monkeypox is usually a self-limiting disease, with symptoms lasting 2 to 4 weeks. Severe cases are more common among children and are related to the extent of exposure to the virus, the patient's health status, and the nature of complications.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the case fatality rate can reach 11% in the general population and has been higher among young children. Previous immune deficiencies can also lead to more severe disease.

Children can contract monkeypox if they have close contact with someone who has symptoms, such as an infected family member. Data from previously affected countries show that children are typically more prone to serious illness than adolescents and adults.

However, the recent outbreak that affects multiple countries that are not considered endemic for the disease has a small number of children among those infected.

[5] Spain: details

https://www.diariosur.es/sociedad/salud/espana-supera-6000-casos-viruela-mono-20220822131134-nt.html


Spain has reached 6119 [now 6284] confirmed cases of monkeypox, 327 more than last Tuesday [16 Aug 2022], according to data as of 19 Aug 2022 by the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE), coordinated by the Ministry of Health.

By autonomous community, Madrid leads the list with 2216 cases, ahead of Catalonia (1825). The rest of the autonomous communities with less than 1000 reported cases are Andalusia (739), Valencian Community (405), Basque Country (188), Balearic Islands (169), and Canary Islands (144).

With less than 100 cases are Galicia (95), Aragon (61), Castile and Leon (57), Asturias (55), Castile-La Mancha (44), Murcia (42), Extremadura (30), Cantabria (29), Navarra (16), La Rioja (4), Ceuta (0) and Melilla (0).

Of the reported cases, a total of 6009 are men and 110 are women. The ages range from 10 months to 88 years, with a median age of 37 years. Of the 5768 cases for which information is available, the 1st reported case showed symptoms on 26 Apr 2022 and the last one on 16 Aug 2022. Up to 4585 out of the 6119 cases for which information is available were men who have sex with men (75%).

The Health Department explains that there is a delay between the date of onset of symptoms and the date of diagnostic confirmation, with a median of 6 days, as well as a delay in the notification of cases, so "the interpretation of the last days of the epidemic curve must be done with caution."

Cases with clinical information presented mainly anogenital rash (59%), fever (54.4%), rash in other locations (not anogenital or oral-oral) (52.1%), and lymphadenopathies (50.8%). A total of 286 cases of the 4406 with information (6.5%) presented complications throughout their clinical process. The most common were mouth ulcers and secondary bacterial infections.

Of the 5463 cases with available information, 178 cases have required hospitalization (3.3%), with 2 deaths due to meningoencephalitis, according to the latest report from the Ministry of Health.

In 77.3 percent of the 3753 cases for which information is available, transmission was through close contact in the context of sexual intercourse and in 9.6 percent through close non-sexual contact.

Regarding attendance at mass events, of the 4571 cases with information on this variable, 786 attended an event on the dates before the onset of symptoms.
