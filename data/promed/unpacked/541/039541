The State Government has issued a public health warning following a
potentially fatal bacterial outbreak. The Department is
investigating 3 cases of confirmed _E. coli_ O157, a type of bacteria
found in the gut of animals which may lead to complications.
It said the 3 _E. coli_ cases were found to be "genetically matched",
suggesting a common source of infection. One of the victims has been
hospitalized with hemolytic uremic syndrome, the same illness linked
to the 1995 Garibaldi [brand garlic mettwurst sausage] epidemic that
caused the death of a 4-year-old from Lewiston [see 1996 ProMED refs. below].
Fearing the number of cases could rise, the Department has placed
doctors and hospitals on high alert.

[Although a small cluster at this point, the cases are clearly
related. It is not specifically stated that the cases are in
Adelaide, and no information is given regarding potential
epidemiological links between the cases.

Australia can be found at: <http://www.ausmaps.com/images/map_australia.gif>.
