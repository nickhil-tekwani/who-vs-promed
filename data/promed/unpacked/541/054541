The exotic tick unknown to the United States before being discovered in Hunterdon County earlier this year [2018] has surfaced in Somerset County, the New Jersey Department of Agriculture announced Friday [7 Sep 2018]. The longhorned tick has also been found in Middlesex, Union and Mercer counties in central New Jersey.

The US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) on Friday [7 Sep 2018] confirmed the Asian longhorned tick, also known as _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, was discovered in Somerset County, making it the 7th county in New Jersey where the tick has been found.

The tick was found on a dog at a residence and was confirmed to be the longhorned tick earlier this week [around 4 Sep 2018]. Earlier findings have also been confirmed in Bergen and Monmouth counties.

Some of these findings have come as a result of residents submitting ticks to the county drop-off locations, where the ticks are picked up and sent for testing. A list of county drop-off locations can be found at <www.state.nj.us/agriculture/>.

"The public has played an important role in helping us identify areas where this tick may be located," said Manoel Tamassia, the New Jersey Department of Agriculture State Veterinarian, in a statement. "The knowledge we have gained from these findings will help us make decisions at local and national levels."

Public parks where the longhorned tick has been found in New Jersey include Davidson Mill County Pond Park in Middlesex County, Overpeck County Park in Bergen County and Watchung Reservation, Houdaille Quarry Park and Briant Park in Union County. There have also been confirmed findings of the longhorned tick in Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia and Arkansas.

Various local, state and federal animal health agencies, as well as Rutgers Center for Vector Biology, continue to work together to identify the range of the Asian longhorned tick in New Jersey. Longhorned ticks that have been collected in New Jersey thus far have tested negative for various human and animal pathogens.

Like [blacklegged] ticks, the nymphs of the Asian longhorned tick are very small (resembling tiny spiders) and can easily go unnoticed on animals and people. Longhorned ticks in other countries have been shown to spread diseases. They are known to infest a wide range of species, including humans, dogs, cats and livestock.

A phone line has also been established to leave a message if a tick is found and there is uncertainty about what the next steps are. If you need information about what to do if you find a tick on yourself, your pets or livestock, call 1-833-NEWTICK (1-833-639-8425).

[With detection of this tick in another New Jersey county, the longhorned tick has become widespread in New Jersey. This tick doubtless is now established in the eastern USA. As noted earlier, either the tick is spreading rapidly or surveillance has been intensified, or both. With discovery of this tick in widely divergent localities in the USA in the past 8 months, one wonders whether it is being moved via birds or by infested domestic animals.

As the report above indicates, this tick is a vector of important pathogens that infect people and domestic animals. Fortunately, so far there is no evidence for this tick transmitting the tickborne pathogens that already occur in the eastern USA, such as Powassan virus and Lyme borreliosis. All tests for the presence of these pathogens in the ticks has been negative so far. One hopes that there will be intensified surveillance in broad areas in the eastern USA to find out whether there are additional longhorned ticks in the area. Ticks can be extremely difficult to control once established in an area.
