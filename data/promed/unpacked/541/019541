[1] Saudi Arabia, UAE, new cases - media report

Medical authorities in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia announced 3 new Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cases today [7 Nov 2013], one in the UAE and 2 in Saudi Arabia.

The case detected in the UAE is in a 75-year-old man from Oman who is hospitalized in Abu Dhabi, according to WAM, the UAE's state news service. The man is visiting the UAE and became ill with respiratory symptoms in October [2013]. He is being treated in the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU), according to the report.

The WAM information came from the Abu Dhabi health authority, which said it is coordinating with the UAE's health ministry and has taken steps recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).

The man's infection is the 6th MERS-CoV case detected in the UAE, and he is the 2nd Omani known to be infected with the virus.

Elsewhere, Saudi Arabia's health ministry said in a statement in Arabic that one of the country's newest cases involves a 72-year-old male resident of Riyadh who has several underlying chronic conditions. He is hospitalized in stable condition and is receiving treatment in the ICU.

The other Saudi case is in a previously healthy 43-year-old from Jeddah who is hospitalized in an ICU. The health ministry said the patient had not recently traveled outside of Jeddah.

The new cases announced today [7 Nov 2013] would lift the global total to 154 cases, including 64 deaths.

In other developments today [7 Nov 2013], Ziad A. Memish, MD, Saudi Arabia' s deputy minister for public health, spoke about MERS-CoV at the European Scientific Conference on Applied Infectious Disease Epidemiology (ESCAIDE) in Stockholm. He told the group that active surveillance for the disease is underway with a special focus on Hajj premises, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said in live tweets from the meeting. He also noted that one of the key questions about MERS-CoV is why the virus behaves differently in different people, a factor that suggests transmission is more complex than previously thought.

Memish's comments came the day after Spanish health officials announced the detection of an imported MERS case that appears to represent the 1st one linked to October's [2013] Hajj observance, an event that drew more than one million foreign travelers to Saudi Arabia. So far, a global surveillance system that tracks illnesses in travelers has reported no MERS-CoV cases, though multiple sentinel sites are reporting sick Hajj travelers, some of whom were hospitalized and screened for the disease.

Philippe Parola, MD, PhD, with GeoSentinel, a network of the International Society of Travel Medicine, wrote in a post to ProMED-mail that a number of influenza A infections have been detected in returning Hajj travelers. He said at least 5 cases were confirmed in France and 7 in Ontario, Canada. Most of the viruses that were subtyped were H3N2.

In Ontario, the 7 flu cases were among 26 patients who were tested for MERS-CoV in October [2013], Parola reported. Six of the 7 flu patients had returned from the Hajj, and the 7th was a child of parents who had made the pilgrimage, he said.

[2] Saudi Arabia, 2 new cases - MOH (Arabic)
Date: 7 Nov 2013

In the framework of the epidemiological investigation and ongoing follow-up carried out by the Ministry of Health for the coronavirus that causes the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), the ministry has announced 2 new cases infected with the virus.

The 1st is a 72-year-old resident of Riyadh who has several chronic diseases and is receiving treatment in the intensive care unit, and his condition is stable. The 2nd case is a 43-year-old resident of Jeddah who has no chronic diseases and does not have a history of travel outside the province of Jeddah recently and is being treated in the intensive care unit.

[The additional 3 cases reported in the above reports (one from the UAE/Oman, the other 2 from Saudi Arabia) bring the global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection to 154 including 64 deaths.

It is interesting that in the MOH statement above, there is mention that one of the cases had no history of travel outside of Jeddah preceding onset of illness. The same is not mentioned for the other case currently treated in Riyadh. One wonders whether there had been a history of travel, and if so, to where?

With respect to the case reported from the UAE in an Omani citizen, what is not mentioned in the report is the timetable for travel of this individual to know where the individual had been at the time of probable transmission.
