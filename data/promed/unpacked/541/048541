A total of 8 serious cases of botulism in France have been detected,
in the Vaucluse and the Somme, due to the green almond tapenade,
manufactured in a traditional manner, the Department of Economics said
on Mon 5 Sep 2011. The tapenade of green almonds, was made in
Cavaillon by a couple in their 60s in a shop, which was immediately
closed.

Services have never had the opportunity to inspect the small workshop
in which the rules of hygiene were not met. The manufacturers did not
have suitable sterilization equipment, said Secretary General of the
Prefecture of Vaucluse on Tue 6 Sep 2011. No control system was
implemented and the company, which has operated for years, had not
been declared to the monitoring services. The couple used a "kind of
washing machine," widely used in families. But it is generally a lack
of sterilization of the conserves which is the source of botulism.

Botulism is rare, but not exceptional in France where there are about
20 cases each year.

Authorities are asking anyone who bought the product not to eat it,
and to return it, if possible, to the place of purchase. Health
authorities have also asked stores to withdraw, as a precaution, all
the conserves produced in this establishment. The consignment consists
of about 60 jars of homemade product branded "The delights of
Marie-Claire" (Les delices de Marie-Claire) sold in grocery stores in
Bouches-du-Rhone, de la Drome, du Var and Vaucluse.

Of the 5 people hospitalized in Avignon, an octogenarian still under
very intensive care, as his condition is life-threatening. The 3 young
women of Somme, for their part were placed under artificial respirator
at the University Hospital of Amiens, the institution stating that
their condition has "stabilized."

[Intoxication with botulinum toxin was originally described from food
in which spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ were able to germinate into
vegetative forms which produce one of the serotypes of toxin which in
human disease is typically A, B or E. In the USA, most cases are,
however, related to infant botulism where the relatively uncolonized
intestinal tract allows the organism to produce toxin in vivo. This
can rarely occur in adults where it is called adult colonization
botulism. Wound botulism can also result in disease related to
necrotic wounds or drug ingestions. The toxin can also be
aerosolized.

Tapenade is a Provencal dish usually consisting of pureed or finely
chopped olives, capers, anchovies and olive oil. Its name comes from
the provencal word for capers, tapenas. It is a popular food in the
south of France, where it is generally eaten as an hors d'oeuvre,
spread on bread. A tapenade can contain almonds as seen in this
recipe:

but should have as its base ingredient the olive. Because it is not
acidic, olives if not prepared properly when canning can be linked to
botulism.

The severity of the disease here could certainly suggest that type A
botulism is the cause or related to a large ingestion of toxin. -
