Please excuse me if I am but sharing my limited knowledge on this matter. I
would like to know how hard is the evidence that incriminates the
strawberries coming from Mexico? From the little I have seen, the
epidemiological evidence seems quite weak and circumstantial. One has to
wonder if, in a political environment that is exploiting anti-immigrant
sentiments, blaming Mexico for a foodborne outbreak could be an easy way
out, given lack of hard data.
I haven't kept myself up to date on where we are with lab techniques in
Hepatitis A. Is it technically feasible to obtain evidence of viral
particles from suspect sources? If this were the case, positive viral
detection from incriminated Mexican frozen strawberries and negative from US
frozen strawberries would establish indubitable evidence of the alleged
contamination.
If this is not technically feasible, then we are left with calculating
attack rates in those who consume or not the suspect strawberries. However,
the long incubation period of Hepatitis A (+/- 4 weeks), makes it
particularly difficult to establish common source foodborne outbreaks,
unless they are extremely obvious.
Hepatitis A is an RNA enterovirus, that presents an epidemiological behavior
similar to that of polio (also an RNA enterovirus) before vaccines where
available. Improvements in sanitary conditions interrupted early fecal oral
transmission, to the point that large pools of susceptible children were
exposedto polio virus when they were no longer toddlers. The older a person,
the more likely to have clinical manifestations of disease when exposed to
polio. Polio infection among toddlers was usually asymptomatic. The same
happens with Hepatitis A infection.
Therefore, an outbreak in a school or a school district, may be the result
of a large concentration of susceptible individuals, where even minor breaks
in sanitary measures (for example, less hand washing among staff and
students in a school cafeteria) may make room for the introduction and rapid
dissemination of Hepatitis A virus. A situation like this can easily make
life impossible for epidemiologists, who are investigating such outbreaks.
Every one wants there to be a single culprit on which to put all the blame,
because once the culprit is found, heroic measures can be taken and everyone
can feel safe again...
>From my personal experience as a national epidemiologist in a Latin American
country, in more cases than not, it was impossible to establish the single
common source in most cases of Hepatitis A. An exception to the above, was
when hepatitis A outbreaks occurred in day care center staff and/or family
members of toddlers who were in day care centers. But that's another story...

It's been very interesting hearing the news reports and reading the Promed
postings regarding the hepatitis A outbreak associated with Mexican grown
strawberries. Having spent several years in Mexico I was often cautioned
about eating any uncooked strawberries in Mexico, even if well washed.
Strawberries grow close to the ground and in many parts of Mexico,
irrigation is accomplished with aquas negras (black water or sewer water).
This easily contaminates ground hugging plants such as strawberries with
whatever pathogen may be present in the water. Because of the highly
irregular surface of the strawberries where bubbles and organic material can
adhere, washing and disinfecting is often inadequate. I was specifically
warned about the risk of aquiring cysticercosis from eating strawberries in
Mexico.

[I must declare a personal bias. I too, like Claude Betts, have had great
difficulty in understanding how only two nearby schools in northern USA
could come down with Hepatitis A infections and all the other schools and
establishments sharing the same shipment should be free of disease. By a
stretch of the imagination all the strawberries from a single contaminated
strawberry field, which can be large, in 1996 might end up at two near
adjoining establishments a year later in 1997, but it is hard. Logically, if
the Mexican irrigation water was to blame if only on a limited series of
farms, some other cases should have occurred elsewhere in other schools,
especially with the high attack rates reported in the two schools indicating
a significant risk and batch contamination. If the contamination was more
widespread, there is even more reason to not expect a very localised
expression. They cannot all have been prevented by serum innoculations. And
if 'aquas negras' are widely used as claimed, disease outbreaks should be a
regular occurence and would be associated with a range of field crops and
fruits.
