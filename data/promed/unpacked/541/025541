Approximately 100 000 cows and buffalos were killed [in India] due to a viral disease called lumpy skin disease [LSD]. According to ABCNews, currently, there are over 2 million sickened.

According to BBC, the disease is brought about by the Capripox virus, which has been dubbed "an emerging threat to livestock worldwide" by health collaboration Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. It is genetically related to the viruses that cause goat and sheep pox. According to experts, cows are likely to contract the disease more frequently than buffalos.

Dr. Ravi Israni, a top veterinary official in Rajasthan state, said that the illness results in lumps on the animal's body. When flies and mosquitoes rest on them, they spread the virus to other healthy animals. He adds that the outbreak might have gotten worse due to the monsoon season's torrential rainfall.

According to a report by Associated Press, the virus has now spread to at least 15 [Indian] states, and the number of cow and buffalo deaths has virtually doubled in the past 3 weeks.

According to Devinder Sharma, an agriculture policy expert in northern Chandigarh, small farmers are disproportionately affected by the cattle epidemic.

He added that the government statistics probably underestimated the actual number of deaths caused by the sickness. He said that it is a severe, serious issue that has been developing over the last couple of years.

Mass graves for cows now dot India's vast hinterland. In certain locations, animal carcasses rot in the open, and settlements are filled with the agonized cries of sick animals. The biggest effects were felt in the western state of Rajasthan, where 60 000 cattle died, and almost 1.4 million became unwell.

Director of the state of Rajasthan's Animal Husbandry Department Narendra Mohan Singh cautioned, "The disease is contagious and it is currently moving from the west to the east."

"Nearly 30-40 cows are dying every day," a distressed villager in Gujarat's Kutch district said. The sickness also affects hundreds of animals in the northern regions of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh.

According to Anil Virani, who works in the animal husbandry department in Gujarat, they have seen that the goat pox vaccine protects against this illness and takes 15 to 20 days to take action.

Farmers in Gujarat and Rajasthan have complained that the state governments did not act quickly enough to stop the disease's spread.

However, administrative procedures in both states are now fully operational. According to Gujarat's agriculture minister Raghavji Patel, the state government has already immunized 300 000 cattle.

With 8 cattle found infected with lumpy skin disease (LSD) in the state, Goa Dairy has provided special booklets to increase awareness among farmers on how to deal with the disease.

"Though the disease has a mortality rate of just 10%, it leads to stoppage of milk in animals," said Mahendra Bale, head of the dairy's veterinary section.

Bale said they are closely monitoring the disease in cattle belonging to its members and they are preparing to further awareness by making a presentation to farmers.

Belonging to the capripoxvirus genus, LSD is characterised by the eruption of nodules on the animal's body. The severity of the disease varies considerably between breeds and strains of cattle. Many cattle suffer severe emaciation and loss of production for several months. The skin lesions cause permanent damage to the hides. The mode of transmission of the disease has not been clearly established.

Animal husbandry and veterinary services director Agostinho Misquita said it has found around 8 confirmed cases in Goa, with maximum of them being from Ponda taluka, as reported first by TOI. The directorate had taken samples from 15 cattle and 7 are yet to be confirmed.

[3] Jharkand: vaccine shortage

A total of 28 probable cases of LSD have been discovered in Jharkhand after the test report from ICAR's NIHSAD (National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases) Laboratory, Bhopal was received by the State Animal Husbandry department. In mid September 2022, a suspected case of LSD was discovered after 2 cows died in Ranchi district. On 19 Sep 2022, 125 samples were sent to Bhopal by the Animal Husbandry Department after the bovine animals became ill with symptoms of lumpy skin disease. Dozens of animals are sick in 6-7 districts of the State.

The test report of 82 samples has come, out of which the LSD virus has been confirmed in 28 samples taken from Deoghar and Ranchi, of which 23 samples from Ranchi and 5 from Deoghar found to be LSD positive. In Ranchi, so far many animals have died in Chanho, Nagri and Khalari, Sonahatu. LSD has been confirmed in the samples taken from the areas of Ranchi like Kulgu, Bandhya, Loadih, Kute, Kamta, Colamba, Daladali, Baridih, Budhmu.

Dr. Vipin Mahatha, Director, Jharkhand State Institute of Animal Health, Kanke said that there is no need for animal owners to panic, treatment for LSD is available [see comment]. Vaccination of animals is being done in all the districts of the state.

The viral disease mainly affects cattle and spreads through mosquitoes, flies, lice, or by coming in contact with contaminated food and water, among others. Cows infected with the disease develop fever and nodules on the skin.

According to the animal husbandry department's records, Ranchi currently has 7.50 lakh [750 000] cows and buffaloes across the district.

There is no vaccine as such for the disease. The Centre has recommended goat pox vaccine. In Ranchi, about 400 doses of the vaccine have been procured from different sources. There is a need to vaccinate all the cows in the district and elsewhere in the state on a war-footing but there is a shortage of the vaccine.

Another official in the department said they are coordinating with the Centre and vaccine-makers to ensure adequate supply. "Things are under process and soon we will arrange for sufficient doses," the official added.

[As apparent from the above media reports, LSD [lumpy skin disease] continues its spread in India. Its detection in Goa reflects its spatial spread, which is not restricted to northern states; an administrative map is available at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/India-Administrative-map.htm. The actual spread of the virus in the Indian subcontinent remains ambiguous due to the scarcity of reports to WOAH.

According to the recommendations of EU's (EFSA) expert panel (20160812.4410864), it is necessary to implement vaccination of the entire susceptible cattle population in regions facing LSDV introduction or already affected. This is in order to minimise the number of outbreaks. High vaccination coverage at animal and farm levels should be achieved. Diseased animals should not be vaccinated.

The use of a heterologous vaccine strain in India (a local goatpox vaccine) deserves to be reviewed. The vaccine issue was last studied when LSD spread into south-eastern countries in Europe during the previous decade. The (abridged) abstract of a 2019 EFSA scientific report follows:

"In 2018, no lumpy skin disease (LSD) outbreaks were reported in the Balkan region, after the decline reported in 2017 (385) compared to 2016 (7483). This confirms the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign based on the LSD homologous vaccine strain which continued throughout 2018 with over 2.5 million animals vaccinated, keeping the mean vaccination coverage above 70%. In 2018, LSD outbreaks were reported in Russia, Turkey and Georgia. In Russia, the LSD epidemics expanded northward and eastward, while in Turkey, the most affected region was in the east. LSD is spreading in Turkey since 2013, despite large vaccination campaigns with heterologous vaccine performed since 2014. This might support the hypothesis that the use of heterologous vaccines results in insufficient protection, and therefore, the use of homologous LSD vaccine in Turkey should be considered to prevent further spread."
