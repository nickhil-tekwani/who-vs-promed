HANTAVIRUS PULMONARY SYNDROME - CANADA (ALBERTA)

[The following information has been received from Dr. Michael Drebot in
relation to the Moderator's comment to the ProMED-mail post of 24 Dec 2002
entitled, "Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome - Canada (Alberta)". My comment
read as follows: "Several hantaviruses have been recorded in Canada:
Prospect Hill virus, Bloodland lake virus, Topografov virus, Sin Nombre
virus, New York virus, El Moro canyon virus, Blue River virus; all
associated with different species of rodents. Of these only Sin Nombre & New
York viruses are etiologic agents of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Unlike
the other Canadian hantaviruses, these 2 are maintained in rodents of the
family _Muridae_, subfamily _Sigmodontinae_. The principal reservoir of Sin
Nombre virus is the deer mouse (_Peromyscus maniculatus_), and that of New
York virus the white-footed mouse (_Peromyscus leucopus_). It seems likely,
therefore, that Sin Nombre virus is the virus responsible for the cases of
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Alberta during 2002." - Mod.CP]

Dr. Michael Drebot's Comment
----------------------------
Although it is possible that several species/genotypes of hantaviruses are
present in Canada, only Sin Nombre virus and Prospect Hill virus have
actually been documented by serological and phylogenetic characterization
(Drebot et al., 2000, Can Commun Dis Rep 26-08, 65-69; Drebot et al., 2001,
Virus Research 75:75-86) to be associated with rodents in this country.
Seropositive deer mice have been identified from British Columbia to
Newfoundland; however, the distribution of infected mice is discontinuous.
Cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) have been identified in four
western provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, & Manitoba),
hantavirus associated illness has not been documented in eastern Canada. To
date, 44 laboratory-confirmed cases of HPS have been reported in Canada.
