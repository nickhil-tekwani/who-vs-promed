[A correspondent at Rector Press Intelligence <info@rectorpress.com> has
written the following to clarify the geographical location of the outbreak.
"Rzhev, Russia is in the Tver Oblast or Province, but it is in the Rzhev
Rayon, not the Tver Rayon. Tver province under the Soviets was Kalinin
Oblast or Province". - Mod.CP]
