In an effort to control the outbreak of the bacterium _Clostridium difficile_, which has already infected 80 people, among them 4 internal medicine students, Roosevelt Hospital authorities have closed the outpatient clinic for new patients, restricted visits, and are cleaning areas of the hospital.

Cases have been recorded since 8 Feb 2013 in the surgical area, internal medicine ward, and adult intensive care area [of the Roosevelt Hospital]. Infection with the bacterium, which is transmitted via the fecal-oral route -- that is, when there is contact with infected people through contaminated hands -- results in mild to severe diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, and intestinal bleeding, and may even be fatal.

The outpatient clinic will remain closed until the outbreak is controlled. For the time being, patients who already had appointments will be seen in different areas of the hospital. Between 150 and 200 people visit the hospital daily in search of medical help.

Jorge Villavicencio, minister of health, explained that they are working on a decentralization program for people who receive ambulatory care in hospitals. "There are cases that can be seen locally."

[_Clostridium difficile_ is the commonest cause of bacterial diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis in hospitalized patients, and antimicrobial drug therapy is the most important risk factor associated with the acquisition of _C. difficile_. Clindamycin, cephalosporins, and more recently fluoroquinolones, are the antibiotics most frequently associated with _C. difficile_ infection (CDI).

However, the epidemiology of CDI has changed with the emergence of a new, hypervirulent strain of _C. difficile_. This strain is referred to as restriction endonuclease type B1, North American pulsed-field type 1 (NAP1), and polymerase chain reaction ribotype 027. It hyperproduces toxins A and B due to a deletion in a regulatory gene, also produces a binary toxin, has an altered antimicrobial resistance pattern (fluoroquinolone resistance), and increased sporulation capacity. CDI due to this strain is characterized by increased severity, high relapse rate, and significant mortality.

The global epidemic of _C. difficile_ B1/NAP1/027 infection in the early to mid-2000s has be shown to be caused by the spread of 2 different but highly related strains of the bacterium, FQR1 and FQR2 (Miao He, Miyajima F, Roberts P, et al. Emergence and global spread of epidemic healthcare-associated _Clostridium difficile_. Nat Genet. 2013 Jan; 45(1): 109-13. doi: 10.1038/ng.2478. Epub 2012 Dec 9; available at http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v45/n1/full/ng.2478.html), that has likely been driven by the acquisition of resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics and widespread increased usage of fluoroquinolones (Drudy D, Kyne L, O'Mahony R, Fanning S. gyrA mutations in fluoroquinolone-resistant _Clostridium difficile_ PCR-027 [letter]. Emerg Infect Dis. 2007; 13(3): 504-5; available at http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/13/3/504.htm).

Preventing the spread of _C. difficile_ in healthcare facilities involves clinical and microbiologic surveillance of hospitalized patients with diarrhea for _C. difficile_ and heightened infection control measures, including prompt patient isolation of patients with _C. difficile_-positive diarrhea or cohorting, where isolation rooms are not available.

_C. difficile_ spores may persist on surfaces for years. The spores remain on environmental surfaces, such as handrails, monitor buttons, and counters and are found on the hands of health care workers. The organism can be spread between susceptible patients via contact with contaminated objects and/or the hands of health care workers. Handwashing is important for preventing the spread of _C. difficile_ infection [CDI]. However, _C. difficile_ spores survive routine environmental cleaning with detergents and hand hygiene with alcohol-based gels. Cleaning of all potentially contaminated surfaces with 10 per cent sodium hypochlorite reduces environmental _C. difficile_ spores, and use of barrier precautions reduces _C. difficile_ transmission. Thorough handwashing with chlorhexidine or with soap and water has been shown to be effective in removing _C. difficile_ spores from hands. Reducing CDI should also focus on minimizing or eliminating unnecessary antimicrobial exposure.

Because CDI is commonest in people who have been hospitalized or institutionalized in long term care facilities, it is puzzling why Roosevelt Hospital in Guatemala City is apparently concentrating infection control efforts by closing the hospital's outpatient department, especially since cases have occurred in the surgical area, internal medicine ward, and adult intensive care area of Roosevelt Hospital. Perhaps the fluoroquinolone-resistant strain NAP1/027 is involved in this outbreak and there has been extensive use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics in the outpatient setting to explain this strategy.

Roosevelt Hospital is said to be the largest hospital in Central America (http://wikimapia.org/105202/Hospital-Roosevelt-Zona-7-Ciudad-de-Guatemala). It is a public medical center that provides free medical care in Guatemala City.
