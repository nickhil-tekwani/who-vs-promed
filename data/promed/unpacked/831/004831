[refers to outbreak in Jan 1999 - Mod.JW

NEW DELHI: The owners of the dairy in Najafgarh where about 100 buffaloes
have died in the past few weeks, [the first report had some 200 deaths "in
the previous month" - Mod. MHJ seem to be in for some relief. The city
government has pressed various departments into action, to check the spread
of the "blood protozoan" infection. While the Union government has assured
additional supply of medicines, chief minister Sheila Dikshit on Monday
directed the animal husbandry department to take
preventive measures in other dairy colonies, keeping in view the death of 73
buffaloes in Najafgarh.
Specialists from the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Izzat
Nagar, arrived here on Sunday afternoon. Blood samples have reportedly been
sent to IVRI for analysis. According to a release from the development
department, 90 per cent of the affected buffaloes are reportedly responding
favourably to treatment.
In a statement, the government said the disease was now under control, with
two more cattle deaths on Sunday, in comparison with 10 deaths last week. Ms
Dikshit has also directed officials to take samples of water and animal feed
to detect the cause of the disease. She stressed the need to pay special
attention to the disposal of dung.
(By a Staff Reporter)
[It would be nice if someone would instruct us as to the cause(s) of these
deaths. The above report has blood samples awaiting analysis, of a "blood
protozoan", and of "successful" treatment -- for what? And why are water and
feed samples necessary, and dung disposal? All outbreaks come to an end, but
in this case is it coincidental with treatment & control or as a
consequence, to reword Sam Johnson's remark.
It is interesting to note that control is claimed by the government
officials on the basis of two buffalo deaths on the Sunday being less than
the ten during the previous week. The
'dairy area' is clearly in need of significant infrastucture improvements.
