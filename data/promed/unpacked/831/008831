Equine herpes outbreak quarantines Balmoral barn
-------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of Equine Herpes Virus-1 (EHV-1) has
necessitated the quarantining of trainer Nelson
Willis' barn at Balmoral Park [in Crete, IL].
Illinois Racing Board chief veterinarian David
Fitzpatrick, DVM, said 4 of the Willis' 38 horses
tested positive initially, and that his barn was
immediately placed in quarantine on 24 Apr [2007,
with none of his horses being allowed to leave
the barn to jog or train. On 27 Apr [2007], the
results of tests on the remaining 34 Willis
horses revealed that 16 more were positive.
"He had 20 horses of his 38 test positive,"
Fitzpatrick said. "The quarantine time is 21 to
28 days after the last clinical signs of EHV-1
appear, and then we'll retest the horses at that
time. There's a very good chance that they'll all
test negative at the end of the quarantine period."
EHV-1 is an airborne infection that can travel
swiftly from one end of a barn to the other,
Fitzpatrick said. Horses have flu-like symptoms
and usually recover quickly, but in some cases, the virus can cause death.
"Almost all horses have been exposed to EHV-1,"
Fitzpatrick said. "Herpes can flare up any time.
You can minimize the chances of an outbreak by
vaccinating, but it doesn't give you 100 percent immunity."
Willis, 63, who's conditioned the winners of more
than $5.6 million, said he is stunned by the
outbreak. "What bothers me is we have no idea
where these horses picked this up. This is devastating to us," Willis said.
Willis on Friday moved his horses to a barn
outside Balmoral, where no horses were currently
housed. Fitzpatrick is confident that the EHV-1
virus was isolated to the Willis barn.
"You can never be 100 percent positive, but it's
doubtful at this point that the disease has
spread," Fitzpatrick said. "The racetracks are
also taking precautions by double-disinfecting
the entire detention and race paddock areas."
Horsemen stabled at Illinois tracks or shipping
in to race now must have proof of EHV-1
vaccinations within 90 days. As well, horses from
out-of-state must have a valid health certificate
and proof of an EHV-1 vaccination within 90 days, Fitzpatrick said.
