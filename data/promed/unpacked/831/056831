Laboratory tests of [samples of] a pig from a farm near Brezice have
come out negative for swine fever [classical swine fever, CSF],
public broadcaster Radio Slovenia reported on Sat 17 Mar 2007.
The negative results, however, do not mean a lifting of the
protective measures brought into effect after an outbreak of swine
fever was reported from nearby Croatia.
Veterinary authorities discovered the possible case of the disease on
Fri 16 Mar 2007, at a small farm in Slogonsko near the Croatian border.
The 2 pigs from the farm were culled and taken to Ljubljana for testing.

[Slovenia borders 2 recently-CSF-infected countries, Croatia and
Hungary. See map at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/slovenia_pol00.jpg>.
Brezice is situated on the Croatian border and can be located on the

.
In view of the circulation of the virus within the free roaming
wild-boar population, it seems unlikely that the disease will remain
exclusively limited to Croatia's neighbour countries. Information on
surveillance activities, particularly in wild boars, will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
