State health officials say this afternoon, 27 Apr 2015, that potato salad made with home-canned potatoes is the likely source of a deadly botulism outbreak at a Lancaster church potluck. Last week, the Ohio Department of Health said tests showed that 6 food samples taken from the 19 Apr 2015 potluck had tested positive for botulism. Sietske de Fijter, chief of the Bureau of Infectious Diseases for the state, said health officials were able to narrow the likely food culprits by interviewing nearly everyone who became ill -- as well as those who didn't -- at the potluck. The common denominator, she said, was homemade potato salad. Lab testing confirmed the presence of botulism.

Over the weekend, the number of confirmed cases rose to 21 after another person was diagnosed with the disease. The number of suspected cases also increased by one to 10. 12 people remain hospitalized in the Columbus area.

Food samples tested by the state were taken from trash bags where other food was mixed in, likely resulting in cross-contamination, officials said. Half the 50 to 60 people who attended the potluck were sickened.

The state received more than 20 food-related samples from the Fairfield Department of Health. The foods included home-canned items: beets, vegetable soup and 2 samples of pears. Most of the samples came from one or 2 trash bags pulled from a trash bin at the church.

The severity of illness for those with botulism varies depending on how much of the contaminated food they eat, said Dr. Julie Mangino, an infectious-disease expert at Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center.

[The bacterial toxin causing] botulism 1st attacks the nerve endings in the head and shows up as drooping eyelids, blurred or double vision, difficulty speaking and trouble holding up one's head. When it moves down the body to the lungs, it becomes life-threatening. An antitoxin stored in federal stockpiles in secret locations can stop botulism in its tracks but not reverse damage already dealt.

All of those sickened in the Lancaster outbreak were treated with the antitoxin, which doctors got from the CDC. The patients are being treated in several central Ohio hospitals.

According to the CDC, there were 1087 cases and 444 outbreaks of foodborne botulism reported in the USA between 1950 and 1996. From 1996 to 2008, there were 116 outbreaks reported to the CDC. Of the 48 outbreaks caused by home-prepared foods, 18 of those were from home-canned vegetables. While rare, outbreaks often occur because home canners do not follow canning instructions, did not use pressure cookers, ignored signs of food spoilage or are not aware of botulism risks from improperly preserving vegetables.

[The total number of individuals affected or suspected to be affected has risen slightly to 31, and the presumptive vehicle has been identified as home-canned potatoes. The serotype of the toxin has not been reported but is likely to be A or B. - Mod.LL
