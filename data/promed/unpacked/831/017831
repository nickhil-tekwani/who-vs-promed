The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reported on 11 Jun
2009] an outbreak of equine piroplasmosis (EP) in Jackson County,
[Missouri]. The last reported occurrence was in February [2009].

EP is a tick-borne disease that affects horses, donkeys, mules, and
zebras. The disease, caused by _Theileria equi_, is transmitted via
tick bites or through mechanical transmission by improperly
disinfected needles or surgical instruments, according to the US
Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service [USDA-APHIS].

The source of the most recent outbreak was deemed "unknown or inconclusive."

The affected premises is a horse stable in Jackson County involving a
7-year-old quarter horse gelding purchased 6 months ago. The horse
showed clinical signs consistent with EP on [1 Jun 2009]. The next
day, the horse was presented to a veterinary medical hospital in
Kansas because of an acute illness consistent with infection of a
blood-borne pathogen. The horse was placed in quarantine and isolation.

The horse and other animals on the affected premises -- 63 including
horses, ponies, and mules -- were examined for ticks. No ticks were
found, according to the OIE report.

Test results for the other animals are pending, and the premises
remains under quarantine. The epidemiological investigation is being
conducted by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in
conjunction with the Missouri Department of Agriculture.

[If the horse or horses have equine piroplasmosis then there was a
tick at some point on the animal. Ticks generally engorge themselves
on the host and then fall off. So the fact that a tick is not found
now, may not be that big a deal. What is a big deal is if that tick
is spreading the disease to another animal and has not been found.
