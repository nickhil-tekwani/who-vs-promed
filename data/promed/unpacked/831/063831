Coffee wilt disease could cut Uganda's coffee output by 35 percent in
2008/09 and slash earnings by USD 150 million, an official of the
government's Kituuza Coffee Research Center said on Tuesday [29 Jul
2008]. Uganda is Africa's 2nd largest coffee producer behind Ethiopia
and has become a major player in robusta production after political
unrest in former top grower Ivory Coast cut output.

The east African country's production has been recovering after the
government initiated a replanting exercise in 2005 following a bout
of coffee wilt disease in 1996. Kangire Africano, director of
Uganda's Kituuza Coffee Research Center, said the disease was
affecting the majority of the coffee farmers countrywide and blamed
the outbreak on planting of wilt-prone trees in 2005. "This was a
mistake. In the mass planting exercise in 2005, farmers mainly
planted coffee that is not resistant to the wilt disease, now we have
started getting reports of wilt cases which might be the start of an
epidemic," he said.

The emergence of the disease in 1996 drastically reduced the
production. By 2002, the disease had affected at least 90 percent of
robusta farms and destroyed over 45 percent of the crop, he said. In
the early 1990s, scientists developed a new variety that was a mix of
robusta and arabica. It matured in less than 2 years and had a higher
output per acre but was susceptible to the disease.

[Coffee wilt disease (CWD, also called tracheomycosis) is caused by
the fungus _Gibberella xylarioides_. Previously, the disease only
occurred sporadically in Africa, but it has recently become more
virulent and is spreading. It is now reported to be present in
Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo on
robusta coffee varieties only. Two species of coffee are being grown
commercially: _Coffea arabica_(arabica or highland coffee) and
_Coffea canephora_ (robusta or lowland coffee). In Uganda, 90 percent
of the coffee crop is robusta, and CWD is reported to have killed
over 12 million plants before the replanting programme in 2005.

CWD can attack all stages of growth and infected plants show 100
percent mortality. Symptoms include wilting, defoliation, and streaks
in the wood. Symptoms occur sequentially until all stems/branches are
killed. Berries ripen prematurely and dry up. Spread occurs with
infected plant material (firewood, seedlings), contaminated soil or
tools, by wind, water, and mechanical means.

Local farmers report yield losses of 50 to 70 percent as well as
losses of plants on a similar scale. Trial plots with improved
cultural management have shown less damage by CWD. Since the whole
region is at risk from CWD, joint efforts of countries to eradicate
the disease have been undertaken. The development of crop varieties
with higher levels of CWD resistance for replanting is the most
promising approach. No reason is given in the report above why highly
susceptible cultivars were used, but due to this fact the recent
replanting programme appears to have been a wasted effort.
