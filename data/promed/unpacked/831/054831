Sudan's Federal Ministry of Health has notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of a yellow fever outbreak in El-Reif El-Shargi and Lagawa localities in West Kordofan state. A technical committee has been established in Khartoum to follow up on the outbreak. Analysis of the data so far received from the field suggests that this is a focal or localized outbreak of yellow fever in an area endemic for the disease.

Initial investigation of more than 10 blood specimens was conducted at the National Public Health Laboratory in Khartoum. These samples were taken from the suspected cases in El-Reif El-Shargi locality in West Kordofan state. Of those tested, 3 samples tested positive for yellow fever.

WHO is assisting the Federal Ministry of Health in reconfirming the outbreak by sending all yellow fever positive samples to the WHO Collaborating Centre for Yellow Fever, the Pasteur Institute in Dakar, Senegal.

Between 3 Oct and 2 Nov 2013, a total of 20 suspected cases of yellow fever were reported, including 7 deaths, presenting a case fatality rate of 35 per cent. Patients were from Al-behara camp, Tabag and Alarda in Lagawa locality. Al-Behara is a camp for seasonal workers for a gum arabic plantation. Patients were originally from east Sudan who travelled a month ago to Kordofan and are residing at Al-Behara camp. The workers usually travel in groups from east Sudan. Currently, an estimated 200 people are residing in the camp.

Of immediate priority during this outbreak is to strengthen case management, control the vectors, and reinforce the disease surveillance system in Kordofan as well as in Kassala and Gedarif states. WHO, through the Federal Ministry of Health, has sent supplies to the State Ministry of Health -- comprising medical equipment, life-saving medicines, laboratory tools, cleaning tools and disinfectant, mosquito nets, and insecticides -- for the affected area.

Late last year [2012], there was an outbreak of yellow fever in Darfur region [the worst in Africa in 20 years - Mod.TY]. The total number of suspected yellow fever cases [in the Darfur outbreak] has reached 849, including 171 deaths (case-fatality rate 20.1 per cent). [In that Darfur outbreak], 3 emergency vaccination campaigns were conducted, with timely support from donors and active involvement of nongovernmental organizations working in the affected localities. Around 5 million people were vaccinated in the 5 states of Darfur.

[It is urgent that the surveillance system be strengthened. It is critical to know what proportion of the resident and transient population of the affected area have been vaccinated previously. If that proportion is low, and the mosquito vector population is relatively high, there is a significant risk of a large outbreak developing, as happened in the Darfur states in 2012-2013. One hopes that the response to this relatively small outbreak is more prompt than in the Darfur outbreak, which resulted in over 800 cases and spill-over into neighboring Chad.

There may be some confusion about the location of West Kordofan state mentioned in the above report. The following University of Texas map does not show West Kordofan state. That state was merged into North Kordofan and South Kordofan states in 2005, but was restored in July this year (2013).

[It is to be hoped that YF vaccine will be procured and applied in the affected area as soon as possible to prevent further spread. - Mod.JW]
