BSE MATERNAL TRANSMISSION: SEAC STATEMENT
-----------------------------------------
Date: Thu, 24 Apr 1997 20:10:41 GMT
From: jralphb@easynet.co.uk (J Ralph Blanchfield)
Here are the texts of the SEAC Statement of 16 April 1997, and the
Report of its Epidemiology Sub-Committee dated 11 April, concerning
the evaluation of the results of the completed seven-year cohort
study, and in particular the attempts to use statistical modelling to
assess the respective contributions of maternal transmission and
genetic predisposition.
In August 1996, when considering the interim report on the cohort
study, SEAC and MAFF both took it for granted that the results must
be due to maternal transmission, and did not consider the possibly
role of genetic predisposition coupled with exposure to contaminated
feed. For those of us who pointed out, and have continued to point
out, that the latter was a possibility to be equally considered, it is
gratifying to note that this is now being taken seriously.

SEAC STATEMENT ON MATERNAL TRANSMISSION OF BSE 16 April 1997:
1. On 29 July 1996, the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory
Committee (SEAC) issued a statement on maternal transmission of BSE
following its consideration of an interim report on a study conducted
by the Epidemiology Department, Central Veterinary Laboratory,
Weybridge to investigate the occurrence and incidence of dam to calf
transmission of BSE (the cohort study).
2 SEAC established an Epidemiology Subcommittee to consider the
final results from the cohort study. The Subcommittee was chaired by
Professor Peter Smith (London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine), a member of SEAC. It included two further members of SEAC,
Dr Richard H Kimberlin (SARDAS) and Professor Will Hueston (University
of Maryland). The Subcommittee also included Professor Roy Anderson
(Oxford University), Professor Robert Curnow (Reading University), Dr
Peter Goodfellow (SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals), Professor Dr.
Ir. Aalt Dijkhuizen (Wageningen Agricultural University, the
Netherlands) Professor Nicholas Day (Medical Research Council
Biostatistics Unit), Dr John Williams (Roslin Institute), Dr Rosalind
Ridley (Cambridge University) and Mr John Wilesrnith (Central
Veterinary Laboratory) The Subcommittee was assisted by Dr
Sheila Gore (Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit), Dr Neil
Ferguson (Oxford University), Dr Christl Donnelly (Oxford University),
Dr John Woolliams (Roslin Institute), and Ms Judith Ryan (Central
Veterinary Laboratory). The Subcommittee met on four occasions, and
submitted its final report on maternal transmission of BSE to SEAC on
11 April 1997.
3. At its meeting on 15 April 1997, SEAC considered and accepted
in full the report from the Epidemiology Subcommittee.
4 SEAC noted that the results of the cohort study were not
inconsistent with those of the case control study published in 1995 by
Hoinville and others of the Epidemiology Department, CVL. That study,
which involved cases of BSE born after the ruminant feed ban, did not
identify significant evidence of maternal transmission, but the
statistical confidence interval included a risk of up to 13 percent
(Veterinary Record (1995) 136, 312-318).
5. The cohort study provides no information on the mechanism of
direct maternal transmission of BSE. We recommend that further
research should be undertaken to shed light on the mechanism. Some
research has already been carried out into potential routes of
transmission from dam to calf, by testing the infectivity of tissues
from BSE-affected animals, including placenta, embryos, blood and
mink: no evidence of infectivity has been found. However, given that
the rate of transmission is probably low, some of these negative
results may be due to the practical difficulties of detecting low
levels, or a low prevalence, of infectivity. SEAC recognises that a
low level of transmission would make research on mechanisms difficult,
and that it would be complemented by a better understanding of the
mechanisms of scrapie transmission in sheep.
6. Any cull based upon the slaughter of calves born to cows in
which BSE has been confirmed will have only a small effect on the
incidence of BSE and the duration of the epidemic. Nevertheless,
Government should consider the possibilities for such a cull, and its effects.
7. SEAC noted that, in its statement of 29 July 1996, it had
concluded that the evidence on maternal transmission did not call into
question existing measures to protect public health. In the light of
the Subcommittee's report, SEAC reconsidered the existing measures.
8. With respect to consumption of bovine products the measures
currently in place to protect the consumer are considered appropriate.
In particular, the Committee considered the possibility of milk being
a vehicle of transmission. SEAC concludes that no evidence has been
found to suggest that milk from any species affected by transmissible
spongiform encephalopathies is infectious. This concurs with the
opinion of the Scientific Veterinary Committee, which advises the
European Commission.
9. With respect to occupational exposure, responsibility for
assessing whether any amendments are needed to the existing Health and
Safety Executive guidance rests with the Advisory Committee on
Dangerous Pathogens.
EPIDEMIOLOGY SUBCOMMITTEE STATEMENT TO SEAC ON MATERNAL TRANSMISSION:
1 In July 1996 SEAC issued a statement on maternal transmission of BSE
following an interim analysis of data from an ongoing study (called the
"cohort study") being conducted by the Epidemiology Department, Central
Veterinary Laboratory (CVL). The study was intended to determine whether
maternal transmission occurred, and
if so, to inform policy makers with respect to animal health
implications.
2. The study involved over 300 "matched-pairs" of calves. One
calf in each pair was the offspring of a confirmed case of BSE
and the other an animal born in the same herd in the same calving
season whose dam had reached the age of 6 years without developing
clinical signs of BSE. The two groups of animals were born between
August 1987 and November 1989, and were taken from their natal herds
between July 1989 and February 1990, aged between 2 and 24 months.
They were kept on one of three experimental farms until they reached
the age of 7 years or were culled at an earlier age with BSE or
another disease. All animals surviving to the age of 7 years were then
slaughtered and their brains were examined pathologically for evidence
of BSE.
3. The preliminary results of the study, when most but not all of
the animals had been followed to the age of 7 years, suggested that
the offspring of BSE cases had an incidence of BSE that was about 10%
greater than that of control animals, with statistical confidence
limits (95%) ranging from 5-15%, the range reflecting the limited
numbers of animals that developed BSE in the study.
4. By November 1996 the last of the animals in the study had
reached the age of 7 years, and by January 1997 the last of their
brains had been examined. As had been anticipated, the final results
were not markedly different from those on which the interim analysis
had been based in 1996. Of the 301 offspring of BSE cases, 42 (14.0%)
developed BSE. Among the 301 offspring of the "control" dams without
BSE, 13 (4.3?/O) developed BSE. The difference between the two risks
was thus 9.6%, and was highly statistically significant with a
confidence interval ranging from 5.1% to 14.2%. A paper giving the
results of the study will be published shortly in the Veterinary
Record by the Epidemiology Department of CVL.
5. The cohort study was set up to investigate the occurrence of
maternal transmission, but interpretation of the results was
confounded by the likely exposure of some of the experimental animals
to contaminated feed The results could be explained by two hypotheses,
acting alone or in combination, namely direct maternal transmission of
infection or inherited genetic variation in susceptibility to BSE via
contaminated feed. Although most of the animals involved in the study
had been born after the ruminant feed ban in July 1988, feed-borne
transmission is thought to have continued beyond that date. This is
consistent with the observation that the BSE risk in both of the
groups was greater among animals born before the introduction of the
feed ban than among animals born later. However, the difference in
risk between the two groups was also greater in those born earlier,
and this would not be expected if direct maternal transmission was the
sole route of infection of the calves in the study. Such an effect
might be apparent if cattle vary in their susceptibility to
contracting BSE from infected feed. It is possible that the offspring
of BSE cases may inherit, from their dams, genes associated with
increased susceptibility to disease and that at least some of the
difference in BSE risk between the offspring of BSE affected and
non-affected dams in the study may be due to inherited factors, rather
than because of direct transmission of BSE from darn to calf.
6. The subcommittee has reviewed the evidence for variation in
genetic susceptibility to BSE in cattle. There is variation in the
risk of TSEs according to genotype in some species. For example,
polymorphisms of the PrP gene are associated with substantial
variation in susceptibility to infection with the scrapie (and in
incubation period ) in sheep and mice and with differences in risk of CJD
in humans. The subcommittee notes, however, that the limited research so
far completed has failed to identify genetic factors as a major component
in the epidemiology of BSE.
7. To assist the CVL Epidemiology Department in the
interpretation of the results of the cohort study, independent
analyses of the data were conducted by three additional groups with
expertise in statistical analysis (based in the Wellcome Trust Centre
for the Epidemiology of Infectious Disease, University of Oxford;
the MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge; and the Department of Applied
Statistics, University of Reading). In so far as was possible, they
tried to evaluate the contributions to the risk difference between the
animals in the two groups from inherited differences in susceptibility
to disease caused by infected feed and from direct transmission of BSE
from dam to calf. In the absence of detailed information on the
genetic make up of the animals in the study, the possible genetic
contribution could only be assessed by statistical modelling.
8. The analyses by the three groups have been submitted for
publication later this year. These analyses reached broadly the same
conclusions. That there was a highly significant difference in risk
between the two groups of animals was clear. The findings did not
definitively establish direct maternal transmission as the sole
explanation for the difference in risk. The statistical model which
fitted the data best involved contributions from both direct maternal
transmission and inherited susceptibility. The main evidence for
direct maternal transmission is that the risk of BSE in the calf of an
affected dam was greatest for calves born close to the onset of BSE in
the dam. However, the power of the study to detect differences related
to the time between BSE onset and the date of birth of a calf was
limited by the design of the study which resulted in 83.4% of the
calves being born within the six months prior to onset of clinical
disease in the dam.
9. Further investigation was necessary of the possible variation
in the risk of BSE associated with the time between the birth of an
animal and the onset of BSE in the dam. This was undertaken mainly by
the group from the Wellcome Centre for the Epidemiology of Infectious
Diseases, University of Oxford through analyses of data on all cases
of BSE born after the ruminant feed ban, which are recorded on the BSE
database held by the Epidemiology Department at the CVL. The findings
will be submitted for publication shortly. Evidence was found that the
subsequent BSE-risk was greatest in calves born after the date of
BSE onset in the dam. For calves born before onset, the risk was
lower, and diminished as the interval between birth and onset
increased, and no risk was apparent more than two years before onset
(see next paragraph). Thus, although possibly subject to some biases,
these analyses also suggested that enhanced BSE-risk in the offspring
of BSE dams involves a low level of direct maternal transmission in
the late stages of the incubation period.
10. In view of the findings of the analyses that are summarised above,
the subcommittee concludes that there is some evidence for direct
maternal transmission of BSE at a low level, but some variation in
genetic susceptibility to BSE following feed-bome exposure may occur.
The risk of transmission of BSE from dam to calf is likely to be less
than 10%, and appears to be confined to animals born after the onset
of BSE in the dam or up to two years beforehand. This level of
transmission is not sufficient, by itself, to perpetuate BSE in the
cattle population and is likely to have only a minor effect on the
rate at which the incidence of BSE declines. It is inevitable that
cases infected via animal feed will continue to appear in diminishing
numbers for several years. Therefore, although the number of cases
infected maternally will be small, they may represent an increasing
proportion of the remaining cases detected.
11. Given the evidence that variation in genetic susceptibility may
have contributed to the results of the cohort study, and of the
importance of genetic factors in TSEs in other species, the
subcommittee considers that further research is necessary to clarify
whether or not variations in the PrP gene or other genes may be
influencing the transmission of, or susceptibility to, BSE in cattle.
Research should seek to identify polymorphisms of the PrP gene which
may be associated wide BSE susceptibility, including stored samples
from the cohort study. There should also be a search for other genetic
markers, outside the PrP gene, which may be associated with an
increased BSE risk in cattle.
