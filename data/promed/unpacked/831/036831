The Centre for Health Protection has confirmed 2 dengue fever cases,
one imported and the other under investigation.
A 21-year-old Tseung Kwan O man came down with fever, muscle pain and
tiredness on 30 Jul [2007] and was admitted to Princess Margaret
Hospital 4 Aug [2007]. He was discharged 8 Aug [2007]. He travelled
to Indonesia with 9 people 6 July- 4 Aug [2007]. His family members
and travel companions have no symptoms.
The 2nd case involved a 57-year-old Tuen Mun man. He came down with
fever, headache and a skin rash on 31 July [2007]. He was sent to
Tuen Mun Hospital 4 Aug [2007] and was discharged 9 Aug [2007]. He
visited Macau 23 Jul - 1 Aug [2007] The centre is investigating the
source of infection and has notified the Macau health authority. His
family members have no symptoms.
Prior to these 2 new cases, 19 imported cases had been reported this
year. Last year [2006] saw 31 cases.

[These 2 cases are probably imported from Indonesia and Macau. There
is no indication that they were acquired in Hong Kong. Without
knowing the status of vector mosquitoes in Hong Kong, it is not
possible to predict the risk of dengue virus transmission there.

Nearly 70 people have died of dengue this year [2007]. The high
number of deaths recorded up to the 1st week of this month [August
2007] is causing concern as health authorities battle to curb the
spread of the outbreak. The 67 deaths recorded [thus far in 2007]
have surpassed the 54 deaths recorded for the same period last year.
A total of 31 279 dengue cases were reported between January and 4
Aug [2007]. There were only 21 117 cases in the same period last
year. The Health Ministry's disease control director, Datuk Dr. Hasan
Abdul Rahman, said the outbreak could only be contained if the public
co-operated by keeping their surroundings clean and free of _Aedes_
[mosquito] breeding grounds.
The states with the highest number of dengue cases are Selangor,
Kelantan, Johor and Kuala Lumpur.
Between 20 Jul - 4 Aug [2007], _Aedes_ breeding grounds were found in
780 of the nearly 70 000 premises checked. A majority of them were
residential houses and shophouses.

With 98 deaths and more than 8000 reported cases of dengue fever
between January and July 2007, Burma is currently facing an 'unusual
occurrence' of the disease said the World Health Organization. It
warned that it is likely to continue until the end of August [2007].
Dr. Chusak, dengue prevention and control of the WHO's Southeast Asia
Regional Office, said with heavy rainfall, the occurrence of the
fever has increased to 8445 reported cases from 6711 cases last year
[2006]. It is likely to continue until the end of August or even
September [2007].
"The peak season is usually August in Burma but according to what we
can see, it is likely to extend up to September [2007]," Dr. Chusak,
who is also coordinator of communicable disease control for WHO's
SEARO, told Mizzima.
Heavy rainfall in Burma this year contributed to the increased
occurrence of the disease, which is potentially a fatal flu-like
viral illness spread by mosquitoes breeding in artificial containers
and improperly managed garbage.
Dr. Chusak said, Dengue is a man-made problem related to human
behaviour and is affected by globalization, rapid unplanned and
unregulated urban development, poor water storage and unsatisfactory
sanitary conditions.
The hardest hit by the disease in Burma are the major cities
including Rangoon, Mandalay and Moulemine as these cities have
undergone rapid urbanization in the last few years.

The number of reported cases of dengue has increased in Indonesia,
Myanmar and Thailand [to date in 2007]. Indonesia has had twice the
number, compared to 45 777 during the same period in 2005. Myanmar
and Thailand are seeing increases of 29 percent and 17 percent
respectively. Many other Asian and Pacific countries are already
facing an unprecedented increase.
Experience from previous years shows that in countries such as India,
including the capital, New Delhi, dengue outbreaks begin to increase
from August onwards soon after the monsoons.

Dengue fever surging in Puerto Rico
Mosquito-borne disease reaches worst levels since 1994 epidemic
-----------------------------------------------------------
Puerto Rican health authorities warned Wed [15 Aug 2007] that the
potentially deadly disease dengue fever was reaching epidemic
proportions and called for a territory-wide campaign to eliminate
breeding grounds of disease-carrying mosquitoes.
Enid Garcia-Rivera, the U.S. territory's secretary of health and
epidemiology, said 2343 confirmed cases of dengue had been reported
since the beginning of the year [2007], more than double the number
of cases reported in the same period last year [2006] and the most
since the dengue epidemic of 1994.
While no deaths have yet been confirmed, the disease is spreading
rapidly, with more than 300 cases reported last week alone [week of 1
Aug 2007]. Because milder forms can be mistaken for common illnesses
like influenza, many victims may not seek medical attention, and the
true number of infections could be 5 to 10 times greater, the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

Of the 178 DHF cases this year [2007], 7 have died. In 2006 there
were 15 deaths.
-------------------------------------------
The numbers of confirmed dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases in
Caera this year [2007] now have passed the numbers registered in
2006. By just the middle of this year, the numbers of people infected
with the hemorrhagic type of the disease reached 178, compared to 172
in the entire past year [2006], according to the Epidemiological
Bulletin issued yesterday [3 Aug 2007] by the Secretary of Health of
the state of Ceara.
The greatest number of cases have occurred in Fortaleza, with 91
proved positives, followed by the city of Crato with 17, and Brejo
Santo with 13, There are an additional 65 cases under investigation,
according to the Secretary of Health.
In relation to the total numbers of cases of the disease [dengue], in
one week there were 695 people infected. There are, as of now, 17
231 [dengue] cases in 160 municipalities [in the state in 2007].
Forteleza has registered the greatest number with 6822 occurrences of
the disease, equivalent to 39.95 per cent of the total in Ceara state.
Almost 7000 [dengue] cases have been confirmed in Forteleza, the
greatest number registered in 10-19 years.
