[So far,] 2 people from Fife have been confirmed with the potentially
fatal _E. coli_ O157 infection, while a 3rd is suspected to have
contracted the bug. NHS [National Health Service] Fife confirmed that
a 12-year-old girl and 2 35-year-old women were thought to have
caught the infection in the Turkish resort of Marmaris in July 2007.
The health board said investigations were continuing as it was
possible other people may have been affected.
The incubation period for the infection is usually about one to 14
days. Dr. Mike Roworth, consultant in public health medicine, said:
"_E. coli_ O157 can spread easily. By taking some simple precautions
people can help reduce the risk of catching the infection. Careful
hand washing, especially before eating, after using the toilet, and
before and after handling food, is one of the most effective methods
people can avoid the infection."

[It has been unusual for _E. coli_ O157 postings on ProMED-mail to
reflect travel-related cases. If this is indeed the case, other
infections may occur in visitors to Marmaris returning to different
countries. No information is given regarding the potential vehicle of
transmission.
Fife (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fife>) is a council area of
Scotland, situated between the Firth of Tay and the Firth of Forth.
It was originally one of the Pictish kingdoms, known as Fib, and is
still commonly known as the Kingdom of Fife within Scotland.
