University of Illinois [UofI] researchers have confirmed the 1st
report of a potential new virus belonging to the genus _Marafivirus_
in switchgrass, a biomass crop. The virus is associated with mosaic
and yellow streak symptoms on switchgrass leaves and has the
potential of reducing photosynthesis and decreasing yield.

Members of this genus have been known to cause severe yield losses in
other crops. For example, _Maize rayado fino virus_ (MRFV), type
member of the genus, has been reported to cause yield reductions in
corn grown in Mexico, Central and South America. The identified virus
in switchgrass is different, but related to the MRFV that has been
reported to infect corn elsewhere, but has never been reported in Illinois.

The _Marafivirus_ was identified in switchgrass from a UofI research
field near campus, where 20 to 30 percent of the plot was infected
with this virus. "We are still working on identifying the insects
that are responsible for transmitting it," said Bright Agindotan,
UofI. "We know that its MRFV relative is transmitted by leafhoppers in corn."

At this time, researchers cannot confirm if this virus affects other
crops. "We don't yet know if the _Marafivirus_ in switchgrass evolved
from the one that infects maize or vice versa," he said. The group
will report the full genome sequence of the switchgrass virus soon.

[Viruses of the genus _Marafivirus_ (family _Tymoviridae_) are
transmitted by leafhopper (_Cicadellidae_) vectors in a persistent
manner (retained during molting, replicating in the vector). They are
not transmitted by seed, pollen, grafting or mechanical means. Other
species in the genus include _Maize rayado fino virus_ affecting
maize and related species of _Zea_, and _Oat blue dwarf virus_
affecting oats, barley, wheat and rye as well as some dicots
including flax and weedy species.

Since marafiviruses have no other means of spread, their host range
is limited by the host range of their vectors. Thus, determining the
vector(s) of the new virus, as mentioned above, will assist in risk
assessment of its possible threat to cereals or other food crops.

Switchgrass (_Panicum virgatum_) is one of the dominant species of
the central North American tallgrass prairie. It is rich in
cellulose, making it attractive as a source for bioproduction of ethanol.
