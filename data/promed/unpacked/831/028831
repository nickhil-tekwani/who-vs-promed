Tyson-owned meatpacker recalls ground beef
------------------------------------------
IBP Inc. is recalling 500 000 pounds of ground beef from 36 states and the
District of Columbia, saying it may be contaminated with the deadly _E.
coli_ bacteria. The recall was voluntary and no illnesses have been
associated with the meat, IBP said Wednesday, adding that it presents no
danger if properly handled and thoroughly cooked. The government recommends
cooking all ground beef to 160 degrees to destroy bacteria. IBP, the
nation's biggest beef processor, recalled 320 000 pounds of ground beef in
April.
Tyson Foods Inc., the poultry giant, bought IBP this year. Tyson spokesman
Ed Nicholson said Thursday it would be "inappropriate" for him to comment
on the recall while the companies are merging. The recalls came just days
after American Foods Group in Wisconsin recalled more than 530 000 pounds
of ground beef in 17 states because of concerns about _E. coli_.
The contamination of the _E. coli_ O157:H7_ bacteria was discovered through
samples collected by the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service.
The beef was produced 7 Aug 2001 in a Dakota City plant and distributed in
5- and 10-pound packages. The beef was distributed to wholesalers,
distributors and grocery stores in: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California,
Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan Minnesota, Mississippi,
Missouri, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Jersey, Nevada, New
York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
The meat shipped to wholesalers bears the product code EST 245C SELL/FREEZE
BY Aug. 25 A (or B) Box Codes D0271BH or D0371BH. Consumers who think they
may have bought some of the meat were advised to contact the store where
the purchase was made. _E. coli_ O157 can cause bloody diarrhea and
dehydration and it can be deadly, especially in children, people with
suppressed immune systems and the elderly. The bacteria kills an estimated
60 Americans each year and sickens an estimated 73 000.
