Young girl diagnosed with tularemia
-----------------------------------
An 18 month old girl suffered swollen glands, lethargy, and a fever after
being bitten by an insect. For days, local doctors tried to help the girl,
but were unable to identify the problem. Finally, the child was taken to
Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, where she was diagnosed with
the potentially fatal disease, tularemia.
Sweetwater County Health Department public health nurse Jodye Wilmes said
generally there are usually 2 to 6 tularemia cases reported a year, mainly
by adult men. A child contracting the disease is unusual.
The rarity of the disease led doctors at the Memorial Hospital of
Sweetwater County to diagnose the symptoms as [resulting from] a bite from
a brown recluse spider. Only after the girl was admitted to the Primary
Children's Hospital did they diagnose her with tularemia, contracted from a
deerfly bite.
The girl's mother said that on the first day, the bite just looked like a
swollen mosquito bite. Over the next few days the bite crusted over, turned
white from pus, then began to turn black. The child's other symptoms
included swollen lymph nodes and lethargy. The child would sweat profusely
when she didn't have a fever, and with a fever wouldn't sweat at all.
The form of the infection involving skin ulcers and lymph node enlargement
is usually acquired by bites by a deer fly or tick or from skinning a
rabbit. Tularemia pneumonia can be acquired from inhaling the organism from
the soil when it is aerosolized by lawn mowing. Tularemia is not contagious
from person to person.
There are several ways to help prevent the disease. When outside, people
should wear protective clothing such as boots, insect repellent, and long
clothing. When skinning a rabbit, wear rubber gloves and be sure to cook
all animals thoroughly.

[This so-far isolated case of ulceroglandular tularemia could have been due
to either a deer fly or tick bite. It is important not to ignore infection
due to _Francisella tularensis_ in the differential diagnosis of an illness
with a local skin lesion, as occurred early in this case. Respiratory
disease due to tularemia is the form one might expect if the bacillus is
aerosolized in a bioterrorist event, but it certainly occurs naturally, as
seen in the Martha's Vineyard cases referenced below. - Mod.LL]
