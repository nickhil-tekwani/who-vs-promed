Rabies deaths in Cross River State
----------------------------------
I think it's high time rabies is given its desired attention as an important health issue in the country [Nigeria]. I'm saying this based on the present situation in my state (Cross River). About 8 persons have died of suspected rabies in the past 4 months. A combined multisectoral team just concluded initial investigation, [and] dog heads [have been] forwarded to the NVRI [National Veterinary Research Institute, Vom, Nigeria] for confirmatory laboratory diagnosis.

We as vets in the state are [conducting] mass vaccination of dogs [in the absence of any form of protection and pre-exposure prophylaxis] because these are not available. Our lives are [on] line, and on a daily basis dog bite cases are reported to the State Veterinary Clinic in Calabar. I think this calls for an urgent intervention.

[Shamsudeen Fagbo commented that: "The correspondent has suggested Nigeria should be talking about other health issues that don't seem to be getting desired attention, other than polio. Definitely rabies comes to mind in this respect.

Information on the outcome of the confirmatory diagnostic tests is awaited.
