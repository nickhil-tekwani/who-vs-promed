Given the emergence and spread of _Shigella sonnei_ with extreme resistance to antibiotics in Europe, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) emphasizes the importance of surveillance and appropriate microbiological diagnosis for its detection. Likewise, it suggests the implementation of infection prevention and control measures for its containment.

In January 2022, an approximately 5-fold increase in cases of gastrointestinal infections among MSM [men who have sex with men] by _S. sonnei_ with extreme antibiotic resistance (XDR) -- implying no sensitivity to penicillins, 3rd-generation cephalosporins, tetracycline, sulfonamides, quinolones, and azithromycin -- was reported in the United Kingdom (5). Similar cases of shigellosis due to _S. sonnei_ were also reported in several European countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, and Spain) between 2020 and 2022, confirming the dissemination of this bacterium in Europe (6).

In the light of these findings, in March 2022 the WHO Regional Office for Europe generated an alert due to the increase in cases of gastrointestinal infections by _S. sonnei_ XDR among MSM (7).

Situation summary in the Region of the Americas:
In the United States of America, shigellosis is the 3rd-most common cause of enteric infection, with approximately 500 000 cases per year. Due to high rates of resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT), the most commonly used antibiotics for the treatment of this disease are ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. However, cases of resistance to these antibiotics have been reported, mainly in shigellosis in MSM (8,9). In Canada, an increase in the number of cases of shigellosis due to _S. flexneri_ has been reported since 2014 (10), and the circulation of _Shigella_ spp. with decreased sensitivity to azithromycin mainly in MSM (11).

According to data compiled by the Latin American Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (ReLAVRA, per its acronym in Spanish), in the period 2014-2020, in the countries of the Region of the Americas participating in the network, the _Shigella_ spp. most frequently recovered from acute diarrheal illness were _S. flexneri_ (49%), _S. sonnei_ (30%), and S. dysenteriae (0.3%). _S. sonnei_ presented high levels of resistance to SXT (58-100%) and ampicillin (10-92.6%). In addition, some countries reported resistance to ciprofloxacin (8-62.7%), azithromycin (12-30%), ceftriaxone (25%), and ceftazidime (17%) (12). There are no data on shigellosis transmitted by sexual contact in Latin America.

So far, cases of shigellosis due to _S. sonnei_ have only been reported in countries with high surveillance capacity and high water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) standards. However, the prolonged transmission time of this bacterium after infection, the potential role of asymptomatic carriers, and the low infectious dose are factors that could favor the spread of XDR strains (7).

In the Region of the Americas, millions of people still lack an adequate source of drinking water and safe facilities for the disposal and elimination of feces. In 2017, it was estimated that some 28 million people lacked access to an improved water source, some 83 million did not have access to improved sanitation facilities, and some 15.6 million still practiced open defecation (13). For this reason, if _S. sonnei_ XDR is introduced into countries with limited resources where water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions are not optimal, the probability of infections by this microorganism increases, and there is a risk of a major outbreak of diarrheal diseases with a high rate of infection and potential lethality in the main risk groups, including children under 5 years of age.

Also of concern is the possible contribution of _S. sonnei_ XDR to the spread of antibiotic resistance in the community through horizontal transfer of mobile genetic elements such as plasmids to other bacterial species.

Recommendations for health authorities
---------------------------------------------
Given these findings, Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) recommends Member States implement and strengthen the early detection of _S. sonnei_ XDR for timely action to prevent the transmission and spread of this microorganism in the community.

Provided below are key guidance for health authorities.

Surveillance and epidemiological investigation
National authorities are advised to strengthen surveillance and epidemiological investigation of _S. sonnei_ to detect possible introductions in new areas and prevent community transmission. To this end, PAHO/WHO recommends the following:
- Increase the participation of national public health laboratories in surveillance activities for the timely detection of cases or outbreaks, to provide early guidance on the antimicrobial treatment of patients and implement prevention and control measures.
- According to the risk assessment through the application of Annex 2 of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), Member States should notify cases or outbreaks of _S. sonnei_ XDR, following the protocols and notification flows of the country/territory, and share information with relevant services and clinics dealing with sexually transmitted infections to alert health workers and decision makers at all levels.
- Strengthen the surveillance of diarrheal disease in vulnerable populations due to _S. sonnei_ or other _Shigella_ species prevalent in the region, warning about the modes of transmission and prevention measures.

Detection by microbiology laboratories
Microbiology laboratories are essential for the detection of the etiological agent and its resistance profile. Therefore, PAHO/WHO recommends the following:
- Follow the guidelines of the WHO manual (14) to take samples.
- Strengthen the identification capabilities of _S. sonnei_ in clinical laboratories.
- Carry out susceptibility tests and monitor the decrease in susceptibility of 1st- and 2nd-line antibiotics, especially fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, and 3rd-generation cephalosporins (including the detection of extended spectrum ÃŸ- lactamases).
- Strengthen the capacity of national reference laboratories to carry out molecular epidemiology techniques to characterize the mechanisms present in XDR isolates.

Infection prevention and control:
The prevention of bloody diarrhea caused by _Shigella_ spp. is based primarily on measures that prevent the spread of the bacteria within the community, including person-to-person transmission. These include the following:
- Continue efforts to provide access to safe water and adequate sanitation to populations.
- Strict attention to hand washing with soap and water, especially after using the bathroom and before preparing, serving, or eating food.
- People affected by shigellosis should not handle or prepare food in catering establishments and private homes until the person recovers or stool culture is negative for _Shigella_ spp.
- People affected by shigellosis should avoid water activities for at least one week after the resolution of the illness.
- Consistently use condoms, maintain barrier protection methods in sexual practices that may facilitate direct contact with feces.

To prevent and control outbreaks of _Shigella_ spp. in health-care settings, in addition to standard precautions, PAHO/WHO recommends:
- Contact isolation measures for patients with suspected or confirmed _Shigella_ spp. infection.
- Where possible, place the patient in a single room with an exclusive bathroom for suspected or confirmed cases of _S. sonnei_ XDR. If this is not possible, cohort infected patients.

Prevention of sexual transmission of _Shigella_ spp. (particularly at-risk groups such as MSM), and to minimize the risk of infection (15), should adopt the following practices:
- Sexual abstinence during symptoms and for 7 days after complete resolution of symptoms.
- Avoid oro-anal exposure for 4-6 weeks, taking into account the transmission period.
- Use barrier protection methods during sexual activity.
- Washing the body, hands, and sex toys before and after sexual intercourse, especially after removing condoms.

Antimicrobial treatment:
Antimicrobial treatment is necessary in patients with severe or invasive disease, in patients requiring hospitalization, with risk factors, and in children under 5 years of age. It decreases the risk of serious complications and death, the duration of symptoms, and the time of transmission/spread, and therefore can be recommended by public health authorities for outbreak control.

Empirical treatment should be based on host factors, severity of infection, results of local susceptibility testing, and history of possible acquisition in travelers to endemic areas. Taking these factors into account, treatment options may be azithromycin, furazolidone, ceftriaxone, cefixime, or ciprofloxacin (16).

Antimicrobial resistance profiles with sufficient epidemiological information will allow early detection and investigation of treatment failures and will serve as the basis for national and international treatment guidelines.

Due to the multi-resistance to antimicrobials reported in cases of shigellosis, mainly in MSM in Europe, the importance of performing sensitivity tests in risk groups is emphasized in order to select the best treatment and reduce the spread of XDR strains.
