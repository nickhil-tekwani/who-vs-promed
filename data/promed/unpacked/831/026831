Three more children were confirmed yesterday to have been infected with the
virus which has killed more than 50 youngsters in Taiwan. The trio - boys
aged one to four - brought the number of confirmed enterovirus-71 cases in
Hong Kong to four, with five suspected cases. All nine patients, who were
unrelated, showed no complications when infected and had fully recovered, a
Department of Health spokesman said. The three boys had previously been on
the list of suspected cases.
Two new suspected cases - a two-year-old boy and a 24-year-old man - were
found yesterday. Their samples, initially found to have EV-71, were
awaiting laboratory test confirmation together with the three other
suspected cases. It was the first time an adult had been involved since
the Department of Health set up a surveillance system last month. The man
was an outpatient who showed hand-foot-mouth symptoms late last month.
By last Saturday, more than 400 children were reported with hand-foot-mouth
disease, which can be one of the symptoms of EV-71. Infectious disease
expert Dr. Lo Wing-lok said adults should be more cautious in observing
hygiene rules, although children under five were usually the hardest hit.
"Hygiene rules apply to all ages. Adults should be more vigilant because
they can pass the virus to children," he said. Dr. Lo said the surge,
which was not "entirely unexpected", indicated that the disease had spread
in the community. "But there is no need to close nurseries or
kindergartens unless an outbreak is confined to one area." Prevention was
still the most effective measure in curbing the spread of the disease for
which there was no vaccine or cure, he said.
A Hospital Authority spokesman said it would update the guidelines given to
all medical workers on the disease in a few days.
