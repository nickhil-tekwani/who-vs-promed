The death toll due to brain fever [encephalitis among children in Andhra
Pradesh has
increased to 176, with 3 more deaths reported on Monday.
Another 681 children suffering from the disease are undergoing treatment in
various hospitals and primary health [centers all over the state.
Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Monday reviewed the situation with
district Collectors, medical and health officers, Municipal Commissioners
and other officials of the 17 affected districts. During the video
conference, Mr Naidu, directed the officials to launch a massive awareness
campaign in the affected areas to educate people about the measures to
control and eradicate the disease.
Since many [districts do not have funds and have expressed inability to
undertake sanitation works, the Chief Minister directed [that funds be
taken from other sources and see that all sanitation works are undertaken
promptly.
As the [primary vertebrate hosts are feral pigs, the government has
started clearing residential areas of pigs.
