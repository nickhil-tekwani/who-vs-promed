Pig disease infects its 8th Hong Kong victim
--------------------------------------------
The deadly swine disease that has sickened hundreds and killed 39
people in Sichuan province infected its 8th victim in Hong Kong, the
Centre for Health Protection announced Wed, 10 Aug 2005.
The CHP and the Department of Health received a report that an
unnamed 78-year-old woman was diagnosed with the virulent
_Streptococcus suis_ disease when she was admitted to Kwong Wah
Hospital in Mong Kok on 8 Aug 2005.
The woman came down with the infection on 3 Aug 2005 and was admitted
to the hospital with a fever and pain in her right hip, doctors said.
The woman, a resident of Mong Kok, is listed in stable condition. She
has [had?] not left Hong Kong, and there are no signs that she has infected
anyone in her household, said health authorities.
CHP staff were interviewing the patient, her family and Kwong Wah
hospital staff Wednesday night for further information on her
condition and treatment.
The pig disease was brought to international attention last month [July 2005]
after mainland authorities revealed that the strain had infected scores and
killed at least 39 people in Sichuan province. Since Jun 2005, 39 people have
died, and officials suspect that 214 have been sickened by the disease.

[The number of cases of _S. suis_ infection in Hong Kong is now 8 for 2005.
It remains unclear whether the Sichuan outbreak is directly related to the
Hong Kong cases, but in those with a clear porcine exposure, contact with pork
from the area may need to be seriously considered. - Mod.LL]
