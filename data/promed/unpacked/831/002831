RABIES - ECUADOR (2) (see ProMED Archive 960314)
====================
Summary of news of RABIES outbreak in Ecuador (from Reuters and
Inter Press Service dispatches, downloaded from Lexis/Nexis)
March 13th, 1996
Headline: "Twelve die in Ecuador rabies outbreak"
A state of emergency was declared in eight provinces. Twelve people died of
rabies and two are receiving treatment. People are advised to stay away from
stray dogs and other animals. Pet owners must vaccinate their animals. The
12 provinces in a state of emergency are: Guayas, Manabi, Canar, Chimborazo,
Loja, Azuay, Napo, and Tungurahua. Other sources indicate that more than
eight provinces are affected.
Panic is spreading through out Ecuador; 11,000 street animals were
exterminated by the government. The director of health, Efrain Pacheco
blames the epidemic on a decrease in vaccinations. Based on data from 1992,
only 35% of the estimated cat/dog population were vaccinated. The hardest
hit city is Guayaquil. On the order of 400 dogs are vaccinated a day now.
In the Guayaquil province only 200,000 units of vaccine and anti-rabies serum
were available for humans and in similar numbers for animals. The public is
complaining about a shortage of vaccines and slow treatment of the problem.
A businessman that was treated for a bite wound say that depending on your
economic and social influence you may receive treatment. The vaccine is
expensive by local standards: $85 ([weekly? monthly?-- Moderator] salary of a
worker is reported as $30).
