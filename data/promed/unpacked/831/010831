The death toll from hepatitis E in northern Uganda has risen to 106, a
week after the government and the World Health Organisation (WHO)
launched a 10 billion Ugandan shillings [USD 6.2 million] programme to
bring the epidemic to an end. Another 6563 remain infected with the
deadly viral disease, which broke out in northern Uganda late last
year [2007]. Over the last week 9 people have died bringing the death
toll to 25 since 17 Jul 2008.

The WHO, which has been supporting the district's Hepatitis E Task
Force, in its recent statements, said there is a drastic decline in
the infection rate in Kitgum, a report the authorities in the
district dispute. Authorities there say the district remains the
worst-hit and the disease, which is spread by poor hygiene, has
claimed 50 lives in Madi Opei sub-county, Lamwo County, where the
outbreak was first reported.

The director for Clinical Health Services in the Ministry of Health,
Dr Kenya Mugisha said the death toll now stands at 106. "The cases of
deaths and new infections are almost half of what we have been
registering in the past and the situation is getting much better
because of increased awareness, distribution of clean containers for
water collection and storage and other supplies, construction of more
pit latrines, among other interventions," he said.

Kitgum chairman Komakech John Ogwok told journalists yesterday [12
Aug 2008] that the continued spread of hepatitis has forced the
council to enact bylaws aimed at controlling the disease. Some of
them include banning the use of water pots and drinking kwete, a
local fermented drink believed to be a prime means of transmission.

Hepatitis E is an acute viral disease that can cause liver failure.
The virus is transmitted to humans through consumption of drink or
food contaminated with faecal matter. It can kill within a week if
not controlled in time.

The disease first struck Kitgum in October 2007, but has since spread
to Gulu, Pader and Yumbe districts. Mr Ogwok, who is also the
chairperson of the district Hepatitis Task Force, claimed jerricans
and chlorine provided under the government/WHO emergency programme
have not helped to check the spread of the disease. The health
worker-turned-politician also dismissed claims in the area that the
disease can spread through sexual intercourse. "This disease has
nothing to do with any one's sexual life," he said. "Having sex with
an infected person does not lead to infection of the other person. It
is a misconception by many people out there." He warned that those
who resort to local herbs instead of going to health centres for
treatment risk succumbing to the disease.

The Ministry of Health recently allocated 25 million Ugandan
shillings [approx. USD 15 325] to support sensitisation programmes in
the district but the money has not been sent to date, according to
officials. Meanwhile, the deputy RDC [resident district
commissioner], Mr Sylvester Opira, said efforts were under way to
arrest and prosecute residents who have refused to construct latrines
in their homes. "We are pleased that with the district-wide
mobilisation carried out to fight the disease, a good number of homes
now have latrines though a few others are still hesitant to have
them. We shall soon start working on them," said Mr Opira.

Agoro border market, one of the busiest markets at the
Uganda-Southern Sudan border was closed recently due to lack of
latrines as a way of combating hepatitis E in the area.

[The number of fatalities has increased from 97 to 106 since 6 Aug
2008 and the number of surviving cases from 5779 to 6563. It is clear
that the outbreak has not yet peaked although containment measures
are being implemented vigorously.
