Rift Valley fever - Mauritania
---------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MOH) notified WHO that between 13 Sep and 1 Oct 2020, 8 cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF) including 7 deaths were confirmed in animal breeders. Districts affected include Tidjikja and Moudjeria (Tagant region), Guerou (Assaba region), and Chinguetty (Adrar region). Laboratory confirmation of RVF infection was performed using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the National Institute for Public Health Research (INRSP) in Nouakchott. The age of infected patients varied between 16 and 70 years old and included one woman and 7 men. All 7 deaths occurred among hospitalised patients with fever and haemorrhagic syndrome (petechia, gingivorrhagia) and vomiting.

Between 4 Sep to 7 Nov 2020, a total of 214 people were sampled, and their samples have been sent to the INRSP for laboratory testing with a total of 75 testing positive for RVF [RT-PCR and serology by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)]. Positive cases have been reported in 11 of 15 regions of the country: Brakna, Trarza, Gorgol, (on the border with Senegal), Adrar, Assaba, Hodh El Gharby, Hodh El Chargui, Guidimaka (on the border with Mali), and Nouakchott Sud, Nouakchott Ouest, and Tagant. The Tagant region is the most affected (38/75, 51%) with principal hotspot districts being Tidjikja and Moudjeria. Thus far a total of 25 deaths have been reported from this outbreak.

Outbreaks in animals have also been confirmed in the regions of Assaba, Tagant, Brakna, Trarza, Hodh El Gharbi, and Hodh El Chargui. The results of 557 animal samples taken as of 15 Oct 2020 showed that 74 camels, 52 small ruminants, and 12 cattle were positive for Rift Valley fever.

WHO is supporting the following public health activities being implemented to respond to the outbreak:

- Regular coordination and technical meetings between public health and animal health sectors
- Coordination of the outbreak response activities at the human-animal interface in all affected regions
- Epidemiological investigation
- Reinforcement of diagnostic capacities
- Preparation of communication tools
- Mobilization of resources and expertise

Joint field missions by FAO, OIE, and WHO experts are planned to support MOH and the Ministry of Rural Development in the prevention and control of RVF outbreaks, in particular with regards to laboratory capacities, surveillance and risk communication to various populations at risk, and in other aspects related to the "One Health" concept.

[Mauritania's 2 reports to the OIE addressing the 6 RVF outbreaks since the start (17 Sep 2020) of the event in animals, including a map, are available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=35869.

The above activities undertaken by the WHO, as well as the other 2 international agencies, FAO and OIE, are to be seen in context with the high risk of RVF occurrence in Mauritania and the region, predicted for the period November 2020 - February 2021. - Mod.AS]

[This outbreak has been going on for several weeks. The conditions that led to the initiation of the outbreak and its continuation are not discussed. One hopes that the measures recommended by the WHO will provide some of those answers. Clearly, a One Health approach is needed, uniting human and animal health expertise along with medical/veterinary entomology to determine if mosquitoes are involved in transmission. - Mod.TY
