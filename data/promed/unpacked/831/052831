Sugar beet 'mystery' condition halts 50 percent of some crops
-------------------------------------------------------------
Farmers are counting the cost of "mystery" symptoms affecting sugar beet crops across parts of England. In some areas more than 50 percent of the beet has failed. The British Beet Research Organisation (BBRO) said many varieties had been affected and growth was "erratic".

Mark Stevens, BBRO, said germinated seeds were "failing to emerge" or emerging "erratically". The 1st reported case was on 29 Apr [2013], but since then farmers in Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Bedfordshire, and Essex have been affected.

"We're seeing some very strange and mysterious symptoms including roots corkscrewing, and deformed plants," Mr Stevens said. The cause of the problem is being investigated, but the BBRO said it was unlikely to be an issue with a single seed supplier.

[A farmer] said: "Significant numbers of seeds have failed to make it above the ground. In extreme cases only about 35 percent of crops are coming through." He has lost about 120 hectares (300 acres) of beet to the mystery condition, which he calculated would cost him GBP 50 000 [approximately USD 75 500]. "The strange thing is, not every field is affected," he said. "I drilled fields on the same day, in the same weather conditions, using the same variety -- some are fine, others not at all."

The BBRO investigation has so far found no indication of disease, nematodes (worms) or fungal infection. The full extent of crop loss has yet to be calculated as the BBRO said information was still coming in from growers and agronomists using different types of seeds in different soils.

[Sugar beet (_Beta vulgaris_ var. _vulgaris_) is a valuable crop of temperate areas and shares a large number of pathogens with other species and varieties of _Beta_. The genus also includes several important root vegetables (for example table beets, beetroot) and leaf (various chards), as well as crops used for animal feed.
