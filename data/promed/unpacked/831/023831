Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Bella Vista, Santa Cecilia, La Cruz, Guanacaste
Date of start of the outbreak: 1 Feb 2015
Outbreak status: resolved (28 Apr 2015)
Epidemiological unit: backyard
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 84 / 71 / 65 / 19 / 0
Affected population: A backyard population in a rural area difficult to access near the northern border of the country

Outbreak statistics: [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 84.52 / 77.38 / 91.55 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: On 22 Apr 2015, an unusual mortality was reported in birds in a rural community. On 24 Apr 2015, this information was followed up, and samples were sent to the laboratory on 25 Apr 2015; diagnosis was confirmed on 26 Apr 2015. There are only backyard birds in the area; it is an area with very bad access and communication, surrounded by forest and where animals roam freely.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside the country; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
National Veterinary Services Laboratory (National laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Birds / nucleotide sequencing / 26 Apr 2015 / Positive
Birds / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 26 Apr 2015 / Positive

Future reporting: the event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Newcastle disease (NCD) is caused by virulent strains of avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) serotype of the genus _Avulavirus_ belonging to the subfamily _Paramyxovirinae_, family _Paramyxoviridae_.

According to the information found in the summary section of this report, the event is indicated as having started on 1 Feb 2015; however, in the epidemiology section of the report, unusual mortality was reported in birds in a rural community on 22 Apr 2015.

It would be important to clarify the dates and, if they are correct, whether or not the total number of affected animals is associated with those that were affected and/or died in February 2015, or whether these were associated with those that were affected in April 2015.

If the event did in fact start back on 1 Feb 2015, and this was then reported to the Veterinary Authorities almost 3 months later, and considering that the affected population involves birds that can freely move and are close to forested areas where there may be exposure to wild birds, how can one be certain that the affected population has been accounted for, that control measures have been properly applied, and that the disease has not spread?

Therefore, it would be of interest to receive more details on the situation, especially since NDv has been absent from domestic poultry since 1990. In 1999, Costa Rica declared itself free of viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease to the World Trade Organization (G/SPS/GEN/119). Poultry production is economically important in Costa Rica, contributing 0.73 percent to the GDP, 4.29 percent of livestock and poultry production, and about 21 percent of the PIB livestock, directly employing 12 500 and indirectly employing over 100 000. The poultry industry is valued at USD 176 873 144; (See, PN-AVI-MC-PV-02 Protocolo de Vigilancia de la Enfermedad de Newcastle(doc): PN-AVI-MC-PV-02 Protocolo de Vigilancia de la Enfermedad de Newcastle at http://www.senasa.go.cr).

Given the high morbidity (84.52 per cent), mortality (77.38 per cent), and case fatality (91.55 per cent) rates, it is likely to be a virulent strain of the virus [see report above].

Although the affected province is not a poultry-dense area, it borders the province of Alajuela, which has the highest poultry population in Costa Rica (Note: See OIE WAHIS database, section Animal population, http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Animalpopulation.
