Indonesia: avian influenza situation - WHO update 21
----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has announced a new case of human
infection of H5N1 avian influenza. A 5-year-old female from the
Tangerang District, Banten Province, developed symptoms on 14 Oct
2007, was hospitalized on 20 Oct 2007, and died in an AI [avian
influenza] referral hospital on 22 Oct 2007. The investigation found
that there were poultry deaths in the case's neighborhood in the 2
weeks prior to her onset of symptoms.

Of the 110 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 89 have been fatal.

[The 89th fatality has been confirmed by WHO as a 5-year-old child
(previously identified as a 4-year-old) from the Tangerang district
of Banten province. The 10-year-old girl in Riau province initially
identified as the 89th fatality, a claim later disputed, can no
longer be considered as an H5N1 case.
