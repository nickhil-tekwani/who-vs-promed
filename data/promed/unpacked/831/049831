[The disease occurs regularly in Europe as elsewhere (famously in
Australia) and is on the OIE (Office International des Epizooties; World
Organisation for Animal Health) list of notifiable diseases for rabbits.
For background information, please link to my comments given in the
ProMED-mail posting on Tunisia referenced below.

It would be helpful to understand why there is a lack of denominators for
the calculation of mortality, morbidity, and other rates. Also, any
information on the source of the outbreak would help enhance our
understanding of the epidemiology of this outbreak. - Mod.PC]
