As many as 275 people across the country, most of them children, have been
hit by _Salmonella_ poisoning, with some cases linked to the shredded cheese
in packaged luncheon snack manufactured by J.M Schneider.
The story says that at last count, 184 people were affected in Ontario and
28 in Newfoundland, with cases in every province except B.C.
Andrea Ellis, an epidemiologist with the federal Laboratory Centre for
Disease Control in Guelph, Ont., was quoted as saying, It is a substantial
outbreak. Ont. had only 529 cases of _Salmonella_ poisoning in all of 1995,
so to have just under 200 cases in one month is significant.
The story notes that in Barrie, Ont., a seven-year-old girl spent eight
days in hospital with salmonella after eating a Schneider product.
Dr. Jean Kamanzi of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency in Ottawa said if
was only on Tues. that laboratories in Dartmouth, N.S. and Toronto
confirmed the presence of salmonella in the Schneider products. The company
issued its voluntary recall the same day.
Ellis was cited as saying that the link between the poisoning cases and the
Schneider product has not been determined anywhere by Newfoundland, and
that there may be other products about which health officials should be
concerned.
Eric Schneider, vice-president of J.M. Schneider, was cited as saying he
was unsure how many cases of the product had been returned or how many
remained in public hands, but that thousands of cases of the four Lunchmate
products were shipped. He added that the four products recalled are the
only ones among 14 Lunchmates that use the shredded cheese. The cheese is
bought from a supplier and the products are assembled at a federally
inspected plant in Guelph.
Dr. Rita Shahin of Toronto's public health department was quoted as telling
the Star that, "We're telling the public to check refrigerators and kids'
lunch bags and return what they find to the stores."
The first case of food poisoning in Ontario was reported March 6, but
officials didn't immediately link it to Lunchmate snacks. John Waters, an
Alberta health official, was quoted as saying, "We are not certain that
these cases are related to this specific recall. However we are closely
investigating these cases to determine any possible link."
