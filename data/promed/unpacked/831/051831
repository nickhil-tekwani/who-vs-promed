Summary
--------
On 7 Nov [2015], WHO declared that Ebola virus transmission had been stopped in Sierra Leone. The country has now entered a 90-day period of enhanced surveillance, which is scheduled to conclude on 5 Feb 2016. Both Liberia and Sierra Leone have now achieved objective 1 of the phase 3 response framework: to interrupt all remaining chains of Ebola virus transmission. Guinea reported no confirmed cases in the week to 8 Nov [2015]. A total of 4 cases have been reported from Guinea in the past 21 days, all of who are members of the same family from the village of Kondeyah, in the subprefecture of Kaliah in Forecariah. All 69 contacts currently being followed in Guinea are located in Kaliah and are scheduled to complete their 21-day follow-up period on 14 Nov [2015]. However, 60 of the contacts are considered to be high risk, and one contact from Forecariah has been lost to follow up within the past 42 days. Therefore, there remains a near-term risk of further cases among both registered and untraced contacts.

Robust surveillance measures are essential to ensure the rapid detection of any reintroduction or re-emergence of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in currently unaffected areas and are central to the attainment of objective 2 of the phase 3 response framework: to manage and respond to the consequences of residual Ebola risks. To that end, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have each put systems in place to enable members of the public to report any case of illness or death that they suspect may be related to EVD. In the week to 8 Nov [2015], 24 634 such alerts were reported in Guinea, with alerts reported from all of the country's 34 prefectures. Equivalent data are not currently available for Liberia. In Sierra Leone, 1690 alerts were reported from 12 of 14 districts in the week ending 25 Oct [2015] (the most recent week for which data are available).

As part of each country's EVD surveillance strategy, blood samples or oral swabs should be collected from any individuals with clinical symptoms compatible with EVD, and from any dead person aged 5 years and above who died within 14 days of onset of symptoms and for whom cause of death has not been determined. In the week to 8 Nov [2015], 9 operational laboratories in Guinea tested a total of 633 new and repeat samples from 12 of the country's 34 prefectures. 89 percent of all samples tested in Guinea were swabs collected from dead bodies. By contrast, 79 percent of the 653 new samples tested in Liberia over the same period were blood samples collected from live patients. In addition, all 15 counties in Liberia submitted samples for testing by the country's 4 operational laboratories. 1294 new samples were collected from all 14 districts in Sierra Leone and tested by 9 operational laboratories. 77 percent of samples in Sierra Leone were swabs collected from dead bodies.

470 deaths in the community were reported from Guinea in the week to 8 Nov [2015]. This represents approximately 20 percent of the 2248 deaths expected based on estimates of the population and a crude mortality rate of 11 deaths per 1000 people per year. All but 4 of the 470 reported deaths were buried safely. Equivalent data are not yet available for Liberia. In Sierra Leone, 1452 reports of community deaths were received through the alert system during the week ending 25 Oct [2015] (the most recent week for which data are available), representing approximately 70 percent of the 2075 deaths expected each week based on estimates of the population and a crude mortality rate of 17 deaths per 1000 people per year.

11 Nov 2015 Brazil: Brazilian man being tested for Ebola; results in 24 hours
http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-11-brazilian-ebola-results-hours.html
[According to Brazil's health minister who spoke yesterday, (10 Nov 2015), a 46-year-old Brazilian man is being transferred to Brazil's top infectious disease hospital in Rio de Janeiro where he will undergo tests, including testing for Ebola virus disease (EVD). The man recently traveled to West Guinea and returned to Brazil on 6 Nov 2015. He went to a clinic 2 days later with symptoms including a high fever. Health workers who came in contact with him are being monitored.]

10 Nov 2015 Guinea: Ebola lingers in Guinea, where outbreak began
http://www.voanews.com/content/ebola-lingers-in-guinea-where-outbreak-began/3052246.html
[Guinea, where the Ebola virus disease (EVD) 1st occurred almost 2 years ago, is the last country in West Africa with an active outbreak. Part of the reason for the continued outbreak is resistance from the community over the necessary steps to be taken to both treat EVD and bring the outbreak to an end. The steps at issue include refusal to follow preventative measures to stop EVD transmission, with many residents preferring to follow the treatments and advice of traditional healers.]

10 Nov 2015 Liberia: Monrovia mayor led life and death battle against Ebola
http://allafrica.com/stories/201511110821.html
[The mayor of Paynesville, Cyvette Gibson, dealt with the Ebola virus disease (EVD) at the height of the outbreak by organizing more than 300 block leaders around 30 community builders in the red-light district of the city, a commercial district, to educate the population of 400 000, monitor their behavior, and trace potential EVD victims before they could spread the disease. Her efforts, backed by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), was successful in reducing the number of Ebola cases in the neighborhood to zero. These results emphasize the role played by women and women's groups, and reinforce the reality that few people in society can mobilize communities as effectively as women.]

9 Nov 2015 UK: 10 staff exposed to Ebola at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital after sample blunder
http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/ten-staff-exposed-ebola-glasgows-6801300
[On 8 Nov 2015, a whistle-blowing scientist at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) said hard-pressed staff did not label an Ebolavirus sample as high risk. As a result, 10 hospital staff require check-ups to make sure they were not infected.

According to the unnamed scientist: "We had an Ebola crisis where a doctor who had seen the patient took a sample to the lab but didn't label it as high risk. About 10 people had to take their temperatures 3 times a day for weeks and phone them in to make sure they didn't have Ebola. ...They wouldn't let them travel on public transport, but they were allowed to come into work and risk infecting their colleagues."]

10 Nov 2015 USA (NY): Brooklyn inmate under Ebola quarantine released to the Feds
http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn-inmate-ebola-quarantine-released-feds-article-1.2430329
[A Brooklyn inmate under Ebola quarantine at the Metropolitan Detention Center since he arrived on a flight from Sierra Leone has been released to the custody of federal agents. The man, WT, was arrested in October 2015 by US Marshals at the John F. Kennedy International Airport and placed under isolation for 21 days, without the presence of symptoms. According to federal agents' statement to Judge Frederic Block, [the inmate] was placed in solitary confinement as a protection from other inmates who might erroneously believe he was infected with the Ebola virus disease (EVD). Judge Block refused a request for release on bail. Instead, the inmate was transported Kansas (USA) where he was indicted on unrelated charges from 2013.]

7 Nov 2015 Regional: West African governments must integrate trained Ebola responders into community-based health systems
http://allafrica.com/stories/201511091651.html
[According to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), all West African countries affected by the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic should integrate trained responders into their community-based health systems.]
