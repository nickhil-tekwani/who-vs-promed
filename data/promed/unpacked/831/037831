LETHAL YELLOWING, COCONUT PALM - UNITED KINGDOM: CAYMAN ISLANDS

Some attention is now being paid to the situation involving coconut
palms on the island, which are being affected by lethal yellowing disease.
The District Officer on Little Cayman, Larry Foster, brought the
outbreak to the attention of the authorities in late 2006, when the
condition appeared to be spreading.
Residents on Little Cayman say they hope that some solution will be
found quickly before the palm population suffers further.
Years ago, the disease literally wiped out the palm population on
Cayman Brac, which had up to that time enjoyed a prosperous export of coconuts.

[Lethal yellowing (LY) was first reported from the Caribbean region,
and, by 1981, it had killed 90 percent of the Jamaica Tall variety of
coconut palms in Jamaica. It is caused by a phytoplasma (_Candidatus_
Phytoplasma palmae), and the plant-hopper _Myndus crudus_ is
suspected to be the vector. Seed-transmission of the pathogen cannot
be excluded. The LY phytoplasma was recently reported to be present
in weed species, which may serve as reservoir hosts (see ProMED post
no. 20070910.2983). LY affects many palm species causing premature
nut drop, blackening of inflorescences, yellowing of fronds, and
finally death of the palm. LY has been spreading in the Americas and
parts of Africa, while in Asia, there are a number of coconut
diseases suspected to be caused by related phytoplasmas (see ProMED
posts 20080105.0063 on Kerala wilt, 20071224.4129 on Cape St Paul wilt).
LY symptoms can be suppressed by regular trunk injections of
tetracycline. This costly treatment is being used to save individual
palms of significance. Commercial control of LY relies on replanting
with resistant varieties. The Malayan Dwarf varieties are highly
resistant to LY and were used to create a number of resistant
hybrids. The level of resistance of a specific cultivar may vary
according to the region where it is grown. Unfortunately, resistance
breakdown of some widely used hybrids has recently been reported,
leading to problems in Jamaica. This is causing great concern for
coconut replanting programmes worldwide, especially since the reasons
for this phenomenon are unknown.
LY has been present in islands of the Cayman group for many years,
however a dramatic increase in the disease is being reported at
present on the northeastern coast of Little Cayman, where most of the
coconut trees have been destroyed. Similar outbreaks have occurred
previously in other LY affected areas, but it is not known what
triggered these. Theories surrounding hurricanes distributing vector
insects or emerging environmental stress factors making palms more
susceptible to vector attacks have been put forward but so far could
not be proven.
