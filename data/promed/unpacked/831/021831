Reversing itself, FDA expresses concerns over health risks from BPA
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reversed its position on
the safety of Bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical found in plastic bottles,
soda cans, food containers and thousands of consumer goods, saying it
now has concerns about health risks.

Growing scientific evidence has linked the chemical to a host of
problems, including cancer, sexual dysfunction and heart disease.
Federal officials said they are particularly concerned about BPA's
effect on the development of fetuses, infants and young children.

"We have some concern, which leads us to recommend reasonable steps
the public can take to reduce exposure to BPA," said Joshua
Sharfstein, FDA's deputy commissioner, in a conference call to
reporters Friday [15 Jan 2010].

Regulators stopped short of banning the compound or even requiring
manufacturers to label products containing BPA, saying that current
data are not clear enough to support a legal crackdown. FDA officials
also said they were hamstrung from dealing quickly with BPA by an
outdated regulatory framework.

Sharfstein said the agency is conducting "targeted" studies of BPA,
part of a 2-year, USD 30 million effort by the administration to
answer key questions about the chemical that will help determine what
action, if any, is necessary to protect public health. The Obama
administration pledged to take a "fresh look" at the chemical.

BPA, used to harden plastics, is so prevalent that more than 90
percent of the U.S. population has traces of it in its urine,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Researchers have found that BPA leaches from containers into food and
beverages, even at cold temperatures.

The FDA's announcement came after extensive talks between federal
agencies and the White House about the best approach to an issue that
has become a significant concern for consumers and the chemical
industry.

One administration official privy to the talks said the FDA is in a
quandary. "They have new evidence that makes them worried, but they
don't have enough proof to justify pulling the stuff, so what do you
do?" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "You
want to warn people, but you don't want to create panic."

The FDA had long maintained that BPA is safe, relying largely on 2
studies funded by the chemical industry. The agency was faulted by its
own panel of independent science advisers in 2008, which said its
position on BPA was scientifically flawed because it ignored more than
100 published studies by government scientists and university
laboratories that raised health concerns about BPA. Recent data found
health effects even at low doses of BPA -- lower than the levels
considered safe by the FDA.

The chemical industry, which produces more than 6 billion tons of BPA
annually and has been fighting restrictions on its use, said Friday's
announcement was good news because the agency did not tell people to
stop using products containing the chemical.

"The science continues to support the safety of BPA," said Steven
Hentges of the American Chemistry Council (ACC).

In a statement, the industry group said: "Plastics made with BPA
contribute safety and convenience to our daily lives because of their
durability, clarity and shatter-resistance. Can liners and food-
storage containers made with BPA are essential components to helping
protect the safety of packaged foods. . . . ACC remains committed to
consumer safety, and will continue to review new scientific studies
concerning the safety of BPA."

Bisphenol A was discovered to be a synthetic estrogen in the 1930s. By
the 1950s, chemists found BPA could be used to make polycarbonate
plastics, giving them a "shatterproof" quality, and the uses for the
chemical exploded.

But recently, consumers have placed increasing pressure on
manufacturers and retailers to migrate away from BPA. In 2008, Babies
R Us and other major retailers told suppliers they would no longer
stock baby bottles made with BPA. Last year, the 6 largest
manufacturers of baby bottles announced they would voluntarily stop
selling bottles made with bisphenol A to consumers in the United States.

But BPA remains in the epoxy linings of most canned goods, including
baby formula. Research has shown that it leaches from the linings into
liquid formula, but not powdered formula.

Environmental groups, public health advocates and consumer
organizations applauded the FDA for recognizing concern about BPA, but
some said the agency didn't go far enough.

"It's really a shame after all of the studies out there that they
didn't do anything to protect the public health," said Urvashi Rangan,
director of technical policy at Consumers Union. "How many pieces of
evidence do we need before we have enough to act?"

Canada declared BPA a toxin and banned it from baby bottles in 2008.
Similar restrictions have taken root in Chicago, Minnesota,
Connecticut and Suffolk County in New York. In Congress, Sens. Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.), Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Edward J.
Markey (D-Mass.) have filed a bill that would block BPA from all food
and drink packaging.

As it awaits additional research results, the FDA plans to change the
way it classifies BPA so that it can exercise tighter controls over
the chemical, Sharfstein said. Currently, BPA is approved as a "food
additive," which means manufacturers are not required to tell the
government which products contain BPA and in what amounts. The agency
wants to reclassify it as a "food contact material," which would
require greater disclosure from manufacturers and would allow the FDA
to take fast action if it determined that the material posed a health
risk.

The Department of Health and Human Services has released recommended
ways for the public to reduce exposure to BPA. They can be found at

[Clearly the information here is compelling to each camp, both for
those banning the product and for those continuing the use of the
product.

The concern has reached worldwide proportions as other countries have
variously banned or limited the use of BPA. In November 2009, the
World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) issued a paper
<http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/fs_management/No_05_Bisphenol_A_Nov09_en.pdf>
detailing some of the animal studies and the unhealthy effects this
chemical can have on the body because of endocrine-mimicking
abilities. However, the WHO did not issue a position, but rather the
statement that it would do a study in 2010. Readers are encouraged to
access the link.

The European Union (EU) issued a draft risk assessment in 2008
<http://ecb.jrc.it/documents/Existing-Chemicals/RISK_ASSESSMENT/ADDENDUM/bisphenola_add_325.pdf>
that was awaiting publication, and may have been published by now, but
I was unable to locate it.

A medical article published by the Journal of the American Medical
Association details many of the health aspects that may be related to
BPA
<http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/300.11.1303>.

As late as September 2008, the US National Toxicology Program
<http://www.bisphenol-a.org/whatsNew/20080905.html> concluded the
product was quite safe.

And certainly the article above indicates the angst that regulators
are experiencing, as FDA appears to have reversed its stance from just
a year ago.

There are huge number of recent (since 2008) research papers, risk
assessments, health associations, environmental associations, as well
as beneficial effects to our food industry. It is a balancing act
between being able to provide readily available food and the health
effects the containers may pose.

One potential problem: if the regulatory authorities in various
countries elect to ban the product, then what is the alternative, and
have safety studies been done? Is there an acceptable protocol for
food [safety] versus risk? - Mod.TG]
