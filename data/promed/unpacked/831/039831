Spain to fly back missionary with EVD from Sierra Leone
-------------------------------------------------------
Spain is sending a plane to fly a Catholic missionary infected with the deadly ebolavirus home from Sierra Leone, officials said Saturday [20 Sep 2014]. Brother MGV, 69, director of a hospital in the Sierra Leonean town of Lunsar, "has tested positive (for EVD) and has expressed his desire to be transferred to Spain", the health ministry said in a statement. He is the 2nd Spaniard to contract EVD in the current outbreak. "In the coming hours a medical plane from the defence ministry will set off for Sierra Leone, carrying 2 doctors and 3 nurses with all the equipment necessary to protect the personnel and maintain the treatment of the patient," it said. It said the risk to public health in Spain from the patient was "practically nil".... The ministry said late Saturday that his repatriation would take place "in the coming hours" and he would be taken straight to Madrid's La Paz-Carlos III hospital.

In August [2014] a 75-year-old Spanish priest became the 1st European to die from EVD during the current outbreak in west Africa, the worst since the disease was 1st discovered 4 decades ago. That missionary, Miguel Pajares, was infected in Liberia, where he worked with EVD patients ... [more]

[Another blow to the international volunteers. It is rather important to find out how and where the break in protection occurred. - Mod.JW]

[2] Sierra Leone: lockdown problems

Thousands of people have defied Sierra Leone's 3-day lockdown to combat the ebolavirus
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
... by crossing the border into Guinea without going through health controls. Health officials in Guinea said people were coming "in waves" through the bush, fearing [knowing - Mod.JW] they would be taken away if they were found to have the disease. Nearly 30 000 health workers, teachers and volunteers are going house to house until Sunday [21 Sep 2014] to educate people about EVD and isolate the sick.

A UN emergency response force to tackle the disease will be anchored in West Africa -- with headquarters in Accra, Ghana and offices in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone ... [more]

[Unintended importation of cases into Guinea has probably resulted. - Mod.JW]

20 Sep 2014 (Interaksyon): In Freetown, teams got off to a slow start, waiting several hours to receive kits containing soap, stickers and flyers. "This morning many families are calling on the radio crying because of lack of food in their homes," said Ahmed Nanoh, executive secretary of Sierra Leone's chamber of agriculture. "Food prices have gone up 30 percent. Many homes that cannot afford (food) are starving.

Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF/Doctors Without Borders), which has been at the forefront of the effort to contain the epidemic, warned last week that the lock-down could lead to the concealment of cases, potentially causing the disease to spread further. [Another unintended consequence. - Mod.JW] An official for the United Nations children's agency UNICEF, Roeland Monasch, said, however, that the "Ose to Ose" campaign, which means "house to house" in local Krio, would be helpful. "If people don't have access to the right information, we need to bring life-saving messages to them, where they live, at their doorsteps," he said.

[The country had 2 weeks notice of the lockdown; food prices probably started going up immediately. But many families probably live hand to mouth. Woman goes out to the market, sells a few things, and with that money buys a bit of food for the family. Husband may be on daily labor, and as he is confined to the house, has no income. - Mod.JW/Corr.SB]

[3] Liberia: declaration by front line health worker
Date: Sat 20 Sep 2014

http://qz.com/268824/liberia-needs-more-than-just-a-serum-to-defeat-ebola


Liberia needs more than just a serum to defeat EVD
--------------------------------------------------
Liberia is fighting a war, which has already killed hundreds and is showing no signs of relenting. We health workers are in the front line of this war, and count for over 8 percent of the victims of EVD in West Africa. We're called "front liners," "national heroes," "true patriots," and yet we are not paid proportionally to the risk we are taking, nor are we provided with the necessary gear to minimize the chance of contagion, or given the vital psychological support as we watch our colleagues die. The families of those who die aren't given support, even though they may have lost their sole breadwinner.

Every EVD victim is 1st of all a human who deserves to be treated with dignity and accorded all the inalienable rights, including the provision of holistic medical service of which quality social and mental health support are fundamental components. EVD victims particularly need to have access to professional counseling because they are not just victims of physical illness but of gross discrimination and abject neglect. In most cases, EVD's victims are prey to minor depression, which speedily degenerates into acute depression, which can be a staunch barrier to physical healing.

But this isn't true only of the victims -- health workers experience vicarious trauma and we need to feel that the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and the Ebola National Task Force consider it their priority to guarantee support and care for us, as well as for the victims.

When doctor Kent Brantly and his colleague Nancy Writebol chose to serve in the EVD treatment center, they fearlessly did so for many reasons, knowing very well (as all Americans do) that in the worst-case scenario their government would watch their backs. Sure enough, when the worst situation occurred, the US didn't default on its promises and eventually airlifted and treated the ill in their best facilities. Dare Liberia not raise the argument that we lack the capacity to follow suit: when the same happened before our eyes, our heroes and heroines were not given the best treatment.

I have not lost hope in Liberia. On the contrary, despite the unfavorable figures and data, I still believe that we have a chance in fierce fight against EVD. But to make it, we have to change a few things now:

- Redefine the role of psychological and social support in our national strategy against EVD and get mental health clinicians, social workers and counselors trained and on board speedily.
- Assign at least 4 social workers or counselors to every EVD treatment unit.
- Let victims in the units, survivors of the disease and their families have access to psychological support as soon as possible.
- Hire and train data entry clerks and 4 data analysts to track and analyze data related to survivors, patients' death, their families' locations and contacts, and the frequency of counseling sessions provided to them.
- Pay health workers their overdue salary and add some incentive to motivate us.
- Enforce the rewarding practice of debriefing, self-care and vicarious trauma counseling session for all staffers at the EVD treatment units.

This isn't done by simply waving a magic wand; there are hurdles and constraints of all sorts. Yet I am of the staunch conviction that if the right people are empowered, monitored and listened to, we as a nation can prevail overall against EVD and other foes -- as we have, with sweat, blood and diligence, overcome in the past.

[Bravo to this Liberian front line health worker for laying it on the line. He is still hopeful his country can overcome this terrible plague. - Mod.JW]

Why I'll risk my life for EVD patients
--------------------------------------
Hundreds of foreign aid workers are in West Africa treating people with EVD. One of them is Cokie van der Velde who has just flown from the UK to Liberia. She explains why she has left the safety of her home to face the deadly virus.... [clip]

I do enjoy my job, I don't think you could do what I do if you didn't enjoy your work. I can't say I particularly enjoy working with dead bodies but there's a lot of camaraderie -- there's a satisfaction when you do get it right, and eventually we will get this epidemic under control. When that happens there will be great elation and the satisfaction of knowing I did a job that maybe not everyone could have done and that I played a small part in helping to overcome this.

[5] Region: critical hospital staff shortage
Date: Sat 20 Sep 2014
Source: Reuters [edited]
http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKKBN0HF06020140920?irpc=932


The USA this week announced it will send in its military to build 17 EVD treatment centers in Liberia. Army engineers from Britain are building a 200-bed hospital in Sierra Leone, while the United Nations has formed a special mission to lead efforts. Experts at a poverty conference run by the US development agency USAID in Washington on Friday [19 Sep 2014] said recruiting staff must be a top priority.

Each 100-bed Ebola treatment center under construction needs 230 trained staff, including 12 medical experts, to function, US officials said. That would mean nearly 4000 personnel for the Liberian facilities due to start opening in October [2014], and it is unclear where they will come from. "Building hospitals and equipping them is great. But unless you have trained personnel to work in them, that is not going to help," said Rabih Torbay, senior vice president at the global healthcare nonprofit International Medical Corps (IMC). "17 [hundred] beds, but who is going to staff them?" asked Torbay, who leads IMC's EVD response.

The epidemic has overwhelmed Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, which had a critical shortage of doctors and nurses even before the EVD outbreak, which began earlier this year [2014]. Infections are estimated at 5000, though the actual rate may be 2 or3 times larger since many people are hiding in their homes. The World Health Organization says the infection rate is doubling every 10-21 days, which means hospitals and clinics may not be built and staffed fast enough to meet demand.

US officials are recruiting healthcare personnel from universities and hospitals, said Torbay. China has pledged doctors and nurses, and the African Union is sending a team of 30 health workers and specialists to the region. But the task of training them is huge, said Christie. They require 7-10 days of classroom and practical work before they can enter hospitals and clinics. Relief staff must replace them every 4-6 weeks because workers get exhausted -- emotionally from the high death toll and physically from wearing 5 layers of protective gear in extreme heat ...

[6] Senegal now EVD-free

Senegal says no risk of EVD spreading from imported case
--------------------------------------------------------
Senegal's health minister said on Friday [19 Sep 2014] there was no further risk of EVD spreading in the West African country, following the end of a quarantine period for those who came into contact with an infected Guinean man. "The risk of the ebolavirus spreading from the imported case is non-existent for our country," Awa Marie Coll Seck told a news conference.

[Byline: Diadie Ba; writing by Emma Farge; editing by Daniel Flynn]

[The Guinean student was reported to be a confirmed EVD case and quarantined in Senegal on Friday, 29 Aug 2014, so the maximum incubation period of 21 days for any contact ended on Friday, 19 Sep 2014. I hate to put a damper on this good news, but
(a) he may have still been infectious in to health workers in hospital for a few days, and
(b) to be absolutely sure, it is usual for a country to wait twice the maximum incubation period, in this case 42 days, before being declared disease-free.

All of Guinea was free of EVD after 42 days without a case (except for Gueckedou), and it looked as though the epidemic was close to an end, when new cases suddenly appeared. - Mod.JW]
