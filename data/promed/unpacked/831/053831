A comment on 'Rabies - Cambodia: canine, human'
-----------------------------------------------
I have seen many cases of rabies. We have an effective long-lived
vaccine which is used for Foreign Service US personnel going to
endemic areas and should be more broadly available especially in zones
(like Amazonia) where rabies in bats is an endemic focus, [and rural
areas of Asia-Pacific countries].

The problem is cost. It is unacceptable that vaccines and medicines
which could have major salutary effects in poor countries are priced
out of their reach until a 3rd party comes in with price support;
i.e., public money guarantees for population administration. Rabies
vaccine, HPV vaccine, etc. should be most used where most needed. Not
[always] the case. One salutary instance is the rollout of meningitis
[vaccine] in Bourkino Fasso...a Public Private partnership -- the way
ahead.
