Ohangwena battles measles outbreak
----------------------------------
Recent confirmation of measles cases in the Ohangwena Region is likely to
add to the woes of the health ministry, which is already battling to
contain swelling numbers of H1N1 cases. National Health Emergency
Preparedness Committee chairperson, Dr Jack Vries, yesterday [27 Aug 2009]
told New Era there are 29 suspected cases of measles in the Engela
district. 2 cases were confirmed positive, while 15 patients are admitted
to that district's hospital. An adult male is also suspected to have the
disease in the Khomas Region and has been admitted at the Katutura State
Hospital.

Epidemiologists are investigating the cases and analysing data before
health experts take further action, Vries said. Should the situation
develop into an outbreak, Namibia might have to re-vaccinate certain
population groups in targeted areas, added Vries. The country's health
authorities especially those in the north of the country are on full alert
after a measles outbreak in Angola is said to have spread to Namibia.

Unlike other diseases that require human contact for transmission, measles
virus can spread very easily through micro-droplets contained in the air
people breathe out or cough. Every year, the country's health ministry goes
on a mass vaccination campaign that sees children under the age of 5
immunised against measles, a disease that can easily lead to pneumonia,
which can be fatal when severe.

Health authorities say there is no reason for alarm as they are monitoring
the situation closely. The symptoms of measles are high temperature, skin
eruptions, pimples, conjunctivitis, earache, cough, and flu. The virus is
now circulating internally and one does not have to travel abroad to be at
risk. The situation, according to health officials, calls for re-doubled
efforts on prevention. It has not been established whether or not travel
restrictions imposed by other countries have served any purpose in
protecting the public or containing the outbreak. It remains unknown how
the situation will evolve in Namibia.
