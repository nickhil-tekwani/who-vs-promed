Zimbabwe's health minister insisted Sunday [30 Nov 2008] that the
country's crumbling medical system was taking all necessary measures
to combat a cholera epidemic, even as more than 1000 new cases were
reported.

Since the current outbreak began in August 2008, health minister
David Parirenyatwa, said 425 people had died and a total of 11 071
suspected cases had been reported nationwide. The last estimate from
the United Nations on Friday [28 Nov 2008] had put the toll at around
9900 cases.

Parirenyatwa said the health services were trying to contain the
disease's alarming spread but warned that already poor sanitation was
likely to worsen with the onset of the rainy season. "What I am
afraid of is that now that the rainy season has come, all the feces
lying in the bushes will be washed into shallow wells and contaminate
the water," Parirenyatwa told the government mouthpiece Sunday Mail
newspaper.

"Management of water and sanitation is primary to the cholera
problem." He emphasized the need for clean water, a proper sewage
system and refuse collection.

[The number of cases of cholera in Zimbabwe continues to rise
dramatically, underscoring the need for rapid intervention.

[2] Cholera - South Africa (Limpopo, Mpumalanga) ex Zimbabwe

The death toll as a result of cholera infection has risen to 5 in
Limpopo, while in Mpumalanga, 2 people were found to have contracted
the disease over the weekend.

This brings to 6 the total number of people who have died since the
outbreak of the waterborne disease 2 weeks ago. One person died in
KwaZulu-Natal last week after being diagnosed with the infection.

Limpopo department of health and social development spokesman Phuti
Seloba said 2 people died at the weekend after contracting the
disease. One of them died shortly after he was admitted to the
Messina Hospital, while another one died at a rehydration centre in
Madimbo, an area outside Musina that is used by most Zimbabweans to
cross into South Africa.

Of the total number of deaths, 2 were South Africans who had
allegedly visited Zimbabwe, and the rest are Zimbabweans.
Departmental records yesterday [30 Nov 2008] showed that at least 363
patients had been treated in various hospitals in Limpopo. 81 of them
have been admitted to the Musina, Siloam and Donald Fraser hospitals.

was previously known as the Northern province.

The recent report of the Iraq Ministry of Health indicates that 892

Most of the new confirmed cases were from Diwanyia. 48 percent of the
cases are found in children below 5 years of age. There have been 11
deaths (7 males and 4 females). 36 percent of the deaths have been in
below-5-year-old children.

[In the totals, only 3 new cases were confirmed from 21 to 27 Nov
2008. However, Diwanyia has 10 newly confirmed cases and one more in
Basra in Wasit, with now one less case in Baghdad and 7 fewer in
Muthana. This should be 4 newly confirmed cases. It is not clear why
confirmed cases should decrease unless they actually were from a
different province. Additionally, despite 7 fewer cases in Muthana,
the attack rate stayed the same.
