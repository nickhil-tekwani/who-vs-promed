Protestors target Wal-mart stores over imported dog treats
---------------------------------------------------------
Not everyone was flocking to Wal-mart stores in search of bargains on Black Friday [23 Nov 2012]. You may have seen news coverage of Wal-Mart workers protesting over health care and wages. There was another group upset at the world's biggest retailer and making its feelings known yesterday: pet owners.

Animal lovers organized a "Black Friday for Pets" to urge Wal-Mart to pull the plug on imports of chicken jerky treats from China, which have been linked to hundreds of dog deaths and illnesses.

The statistics are alarming. Since 2007, the FDA has received 2200 complaints from pet owners who claim that their animals suffered illness or death after eating the treats. At least 360 dogs and 1 cat, who ingested the treats died, usually from kidney failure, owners say.

The FDA has issued 3 warnings about the products in the past 5 years but has not yet found a cause for the illnesses and has not issued any recalls.

Protest organizers say Wal-mart carries the popular treat brands -- Waggin' Train and Canyon Creek Ranch, both produced by Nestle Purina and made in China -- and they say if Wal-mart stops, other retailers will too, according ABC News.

Susan Thixton, editor of a website that has been following the Chinese jerky treat issue, is one of the event organizers. "Pets are continuing to die from these treats," she told ABC News. "Clearly there's an issue with them, they're unsafe. We're doing this to save pets' lives."

In a statement to ABC News, a Wal-Mart representative said the company is continuing to closely monitor the issue "and will take "appropriate action" if the FDA establishes a connection between the Chinese made treats and the pet deaths.

Wal-Mart also says it encourages consumers to reach out directly to the FDA or the manufacturers of the products.

But many pet owners aren't waiting for Wal-Mart to respond. They are shopping for U.S.-made treats. And at least one pet retailer is listening -- at least partially. I happened to be in PetSmart today on a cat litter run and stopped in the dog treat aisle to see if PetSmart carried the products in question. I didn't see them, but I did hear a PetSmart employee explaining to a customer that many of the dog treats are U.S. made and pointing out the brands to her.

A Google search, though, reveals that PetSmart does indeed carry both Waggin Train and Canyon Creek Ranch brands both made by Nestle/Purina. Criticism over the fact the company carries the treats runs rampant on the Internet. PetSmart has tried to ease consumers' fears by assuring them they inspect the factories and are confident the treats are safe. Caveat emptor.

[The FDA has posted several warnings regarding chicken jerky treats. The FDA and at least 2 veterinary universities have invested time, money and effort to unravel the mysterious situation that seems to be causing pet death generally from a fanconi-like syndrome.

Thus far, there is no test for the product that points to a particular ingredient. The test for the animals is generally blood chemistry panels that reveal most often kidney disease.

While the manufactures are working to learn why this situation exists, there is no answer yet. They are examining every ingredient and every step of the processing procedure to try and learn why this is happening.

In some cases the animals like the treats so much that owners substitute larger number of treats for the regular food. Pet treats should never take the place of the regular food. They are treats and are meant to be given only occasionally.

Since there are warnings out there, one wonders why people are still feeding the product? If customers quit buying the product, then retail outlets would stop carrying the product.

It is interesting to note the protests occurred at Wal-mart, but not at other retail outlets that carry the product. - Mod.TG]
