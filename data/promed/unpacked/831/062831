Bird flu outbreaks reported in 11 southern Vietnamese provinces
---------------------------------------------------
Veterinary officials confirmed the spread of bird flu to an 11th province
in Vietnam's southern Mekong Delta, as the government urged heightened
vigilance against the re-emergence of the dangerous virus, an official said
Tuesday [27 Jul 2004].
Long An province is the latest area where the H5N1 virus -- which jumped
from poultry to humans earlier in 2004, killing 24 people in Vietnam and
Thailand -- has staged a comeback, said Hoang Van Nam, head of the
epidemiology section of the Veterinary Department.
To date, more than 50 000 birds have died or been culled in the 11
provinces in the most recent wave of outbreaks since the virus resurfaced
in the country after Vietnam declared itself free of bird flu at the end of
March 2004.
Earlier in July 2004, the disease killed more than 1000 chickens in Long An
province. Since then, some 4000 chickens at 2 farms have been culled as a
precaution to halt the spread of the virus.
Bird flu has also re-emerged in China, Thailand and Indonesia over the past
month.
"The danger of bird flu recurrence and (of it) spreading further remains
high," Nam said. He attributed the heightened concern to unchecked poultry
being smuggled into Vietnam and migratory birds that might carry N5H1 from
country to country.
Long An, a major poultry breeding area in the Mekong Delta just 60
kilometres southwest of Ho Chi Minh City, was the first place that reported
bird flu outbreaks in Vietnam late in 2003.
It was one of the worst hit by the epidemic, which eventually spread to 57
of the country's 64 provinces. More than 43 million poultry died or were
culled in Vietnam.
The virus also jumped to humans, killing 16 people here [Viet Nam] and
another 8 in Thailand.

EU extends ban on chicken
--------------------------
The 25-nation European Union yesterday extended a ban on chicken products
and pet birds from 9 Asian countries -- including Thailand -- due to the
potentially deadly bird flu. The ban runs until 15 Dec 2004.
"The Commission has adopted a decision to continue the suspension of
imports into the EU of chicken products and pet birds from several Asian
countries where avian influenza has been confirmed since the beginning of
the year," the executive European Commission said in a statement.
Including Thailand, the countries are Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, Laos,
Pakistan, China, South Korea and Vietnam.
The ban had been due to expire on 15 Aug 2004, but a new outbreak was
confirmed in Thailand on 3 Jul 2004.
Deputy Prime Minister Chaturon Chaisang said yesterday that the government
was willing to disclose bird-flu information. There would [be] no cover-up,
he said.
Chaturon said culling teams had killed poultry in 107 areas in 31
provinces, but found the virus in only 47 areas in 18 provinces.
The country was strictly following the government's policy on food safety,
which had resulted in an aggressive stance in dealing with the spread of
the virus.
In 53 of the cull areas, he said, less than 50 chickens were killed. "Some
areas had only one or two chickens killed. There were only 20 areas that
had over 1000 chickens culled and 3 areas where over 10 000 chickens were
culled," he said.
Agriculture and Cooperatives Minister Somsak Thepsuthin said the government
was confident it had the virus under control.
But he added: "No one can give a guarantee, especially when it rains and
becomes cold."
Livestock Development Department director-general Yukol Limlamthong said
the department would request Bt2.3 billion [about 55.7 million USD] as
compensation for farmers whose chickens were culled in both the first and
second outbreaks of the virus.
