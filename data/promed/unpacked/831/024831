More than 20 _E. coli_ infections are being investigated in a German municipality. 4 day care centers in the Luetzow-Luebstorf district are affected by the outbreak of _E. coli_ O26, an enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) strain. Luetzow-Luebstorf is in [Northwestern Mecklenburg, in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania], Germany. EHEC is often referred to as Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC).

Authorities initially reported 18 patients but that had risen to 25 by the end of this past week. They warned further testing is ongoing so more cases are expected. Those sick include children and their relatives as well as a couple of daycare center employees. The majority of those affected have mild or no symptoms, but there are also some cases of severe diarrhea. Currently, there have not been any hospitalizations and no patients have developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).

Testing of products and in the premises of a food processing company that supplies the day care centers was negative. Officials believe the pathogen did not enter the centers via food prepared by the company, but through other means, which are being investigated.

Symptoms of _E. coli_ infections vary for each person but often include severe stomach cramps and diarrhea, which is often bloody. Some patients may also have a fever. Most patients recover within 5 to 7 days. Others can develop severe or life-threatening symptoms and complications, according to the CDC.

About 5 percent to 10 percent of those diagnosed with _E. coli_ infections develop a potentially life-threatening kidney failure complication, known as hemolytic uremic syndrome. Symptoms of HUS include fever, abdominal pain, feeling very tired, decreased frequency of urination, small unexplained bruises or bleeding, and pallor.

[Given that multiple day care centers are involved, it is curious that it is believed that the EHEC did not enter the centers via food from the food processing company supplying the centers. ProMED awaits more information regarding the source of this ongoing outbreak. - Mod.LL
