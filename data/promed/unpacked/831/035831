Dangerous avian flu strain confirmed in Adygeya
------------------------------------------------
Tests for bird flu taken in Ulyap and Jambechyi villages in Adygeya,
Russia, were sent to Krasnodar and Moscow and turned positive for
H5N1 bird flu strain, dangerous for human.
Interviewed by REGNUM, senior expert of the Veterinary Service of the
Republic of Adygeya, Nikolai Belokopytov, said: "Actions are taken in
Ulyap and Jambechyi villages in the framework of the quarantine, no
birds plague has been registered in the villages since 27 Feb 2007.
Tests in Moscow showed positive for H5N1 bird flu strain dangerous
for human. I need to admit it no cases of human being infected by the
virus have been registered in Russia. Everything scheduled in the
frameworks of fighting the bird flu outbreak in the villages will be
fulfilled; there is no reason for panicking; the situation is under control."

Vietnam isolates Hanoi bird flu site, virus strikes south
-----------------------------------------------------
Vietnamese health workers Friday [9 Mar 2007] moved to contain a bird
flu outbreak in the capital Hanoi as the H5N1 virus spread to a 5th
location within 3 weeks, in the country's southern Mekong Delta.
Donning protective suits and face masks, workers in Hanoi sprayed
disinfectant at several poultry farms on the northern outskirts of
the city where 2000 chickens died of the virus or were destroyed
earlier this week.
Police and officials manned 24-hour checkpoints, set up since Monday,
leading into the Hau Duong hamlet in suburban Dong Anh district to
quarantine the site of the outbreak, where another 2000 birds have
since been vaccinated.
"No poultry and poultry products are allowed to be transported in or
out of the area," local veterinarian Do Van Thanh told AFP. "Local
residents must wear masks if they come out of their houses."
Health officials warn of a heightened risk as the killer virus, like
other respiratory diseases, spreads faster in the cold winter months,
aided by the fact that people tend to spend more time together in
confined spaces.
The 5th location in Vietnam since late February [2007 was a] flock of
2-month-old ducks in Can Tho, a city 170 km (100 miles) southwest of
Ho Chi Minh City.
About 100 of the unvaccinated ducks died of the H5N1 strain Wednesday
[7 Mar 2007] and 400 more birds were destroyed, said the national
animal health department, part of the agriculture ministry.
The virus has also been reported in the northern provinces of Ha Tay
and Hai Duong and in the southern Vinh Long province in recent weeks,
following a spate of outbreaks in the south in December [2006] and
January [2007].
The H5N1 strain hit Vietnam in late 2003, killing or forcing the
culling of millions of birds. Over the next 2 years bird flu killed
42 people in Vietnam, but no new human cases have been reported there
since November 2005.

[If one looks at the map of Viet Nam, one can see the wide geographic
range of affected areas in the past few weeks, with the reports
involving areas in the north of the country near to the capital city
of Ha Noi, and involvement of southern provinces as well, closer to
Ho Chi Minh City. For maps of Viet Nam, see

[3] China (Hong Kong), wild birds

Hong Kong confirms virus
-----------------
Another bird in Hong Kong has tested positive for the deadly H5N1
bird flu virus, authorities said on Friday [9 Mar 2007].
A long-tailed shrike [_Lanius schach_, Order: Passeiformes, family:
Laniidae, genus: Lanius, picture at
<http://www.orientalbirdimages.org/birdimages.php?action=birdspecies&Bird_ID=2405&Bird_Image_ID=8552&PHPSESSID=5c556f94d1>]
found dead on 3 Mar 2007 in the densely populated Hung Hom district
was confirmed with the disease by the government's agriculture,
fisheries and conservation department.
It is the latest in a series of cases in which wild birds have been
found to be infected with the virus, which has killed more than 160
people worldwide since 2003.
Wild migratory birds have been blamed for the global spread of the disease.
Biologists believe local species of wild birds found dead with the
virus could have picked it up from contact with infected flocks in
mainland China, where it is believed the strain first mutated into a
form deadly to humans.
Hong Kong was the scene of the world's first reported major bird flu
outbreak among humans in 1997, when 6 people died.

[Hong Kong (Special Administrative Region) maintains an exemplary
programme for avian influenza surveillance and prevention. Results of
the veterinary laboratory tests in collected carcasses of wild birds
are accessible in the website of the Agriculture, Fisheries, and
Conservation Department (AFCP)
<<http://www.afcd.gov.hk/eindex.html>http://www.afcd.gov.hk/eindex.html>.
The long-tailed shrike is the 1st of its species, and the 15th wild
bird found positive since the beginning of 2007.
The success of the authorities in preventing outbreaks in local
domestic poultry and human cases, in spite of the apparent endemicity
of the virus within the wild bird population, is impressive.

[4] China (Guandong) animal transport

Upsurge in live chick transports from Guangdong to other parts of China.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Recently, there has been a sudden increase in the number of chicks
from the Pearl River Delta "boarding" airplanes bound for domestic
cities. China Southern Airlines Cargo Department explained that the
daily average of chicks "boarding planes" at China Southern's
Guangzhou Cargo Station has risen from 1 ton to 3 tons. Most of
these chicks are bound for Chengdu, Chongqing, Shanghai, Hangzhou,
and other places.
After a thoroughly warm winter, Guangdong's Spring temperature has
increased substantially -- particularly suitable for chick
breeding. Over the recent period, a large number of chicks in the
Pearl River Delta hatched early. Besides meeting Guangdong market
demand, a great number can be supplied to the [other parts of the]
domestic market. As a result, chicks have recently been shipped en
masse, forming this peak in air shipments.
To guarantee chick transport, China Southern's Guangzhou Cargo
Station adopted a series of service measures:
1) Proactively assist cargo owners to book cargo space, since chicks
must "book seats" to fly and ensure they can stay in an oxygenated
cargo hold, otherwise they can die due to lack of oxygen in the hold.
2) Allow chicks to stay in a "waiting room reserved for animals", and
carry out daily disinfection of the holding area to ensure the health
of chicks.
3) Guarantee priority loading of chicks, send dedicated personnel to
monitor loading of chicks, and ensure the safety and timely loading
of clients' transported chicks.

[The intensive traffic of breeding material, probably day-old-chicks,
from Guandong to other parts of the the Chinese mega state, is of
interest -- particularly in view of the information on Guandong's key
role within the epidemiology of avian influenza (see Avian influenza
(49): phylogeography 20070308.0819). It would be interesting to
obtain information on the veterinary surveillance carried out in
Guandong's poultry breeding flocks and hatcheries, including
vaccination programmes. - Mod. AS].
