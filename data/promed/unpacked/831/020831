A rare and incurable endemic bone ailment has caused a panic in case
of residents residing in remote Tibetan region, threatening more than
170 000 people.

More than 14 662 people have been diagnosed with Kaschin-Beck disease
in 11 counties in Qamdo prefecture, one of the gravely infected
areas, as per the survey findings performed by local health
authorities.

The findings stated that more than 1.70 lakh [170 000] are at risk
from the disease.

The patients diagnosed with the disease complain of development of
thick and deformed joints, which prevents any type of movement
whatsoever, Xinhua news agency reported today [17 Oct 2010].

Doctors state that the reason of the disease remains unknown, but
some believe that a fungus present in barley, a staple food in the
plateau, is the supposed cause for the same.

The local government is promoting [investigations on] the cause and
curbing on the ways to prevent the spread of disease.

In the past 5 years, nearly 90 million yuan (USD 13. 55 million) have
been spent on the relocation programme and approximately 20 000
residents have been relocated.

[The cause of this malady is unknown. Therefore is relocating
individuals really going to change things? Identifying the cause and
preventing it is more likely a reasonable approach.

It has been suggested that it is a fungus _Fusarium_ that grows in
barley. Does the fungus grow only in this area of Tibet or can it
grow anywhere? In the US, we have _Fusarium_ on corn that can be
lethal to horses. _Fusarium_ prefers a particular microclimate on the
grates with allows it to grow. It can grow on other grains other than
barley and corn.

Selenium has been nominated as a causative agent. However, whether it
is excessive selenium or deficiency of selenium has not been proven.
However it seems some nutritional studies and clinical blood work
could help make the determination if selenium were involved. - Mod.TG]

[Also named 'big bone disease,' the eponym derives from two Russian
physicians who described the osteoarticular disease, which can result
in dwarfism. It appears to be prevalent in very distinct areas of
Asia, notably Tibet, as well as the Korean peninsula and Siberia, and
has been the subject of scrutiny by a project begun by Medecins sans
Frontieres in 1992. Kashin-Beck disease appears to be
multifactorial, perhaps involving a combination of mineral
deficiencies and mycotoxins produced in stored grain. More
