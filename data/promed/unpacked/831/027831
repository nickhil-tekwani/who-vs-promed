[1] Netherlands, vaccination

The livestock farming sector is not unanimous over obligatory or
voluntary vaccination against bluetongue.

The national working group on professional sheep breeding [Landelijke
Werkgroep Professionele Schapenhouderij, LWPS] advocates compulsory
vaccination.

The LWPS requires prescribed requirements from the vaccine. "It
should not cause any problems, such as abortions of ewes," says
chairman Erich Rhose. "Compulsory vaccination will benefit from the
promised assistance of the EU as well as of the Dutch government;
hence, the choice is not difficult," says Rhose.

LTO Nederland [The Dutch Organisation for Agriculture and
Horticulture; an umbrella organisation for 5 regional and 16 sector
organisations in agriculture and horticulture, focusing in particular
on political activities] is currently supportive of voluntary
vaccination. "We are awaiting the results of an ongoing research in
the Wageningen University. In addition, the action undertaken by
other countries is of importance," says Siemjan Schenk of the
professional cattle breeding group. "If I had to choose now, I would
have opted for voluntary vaccination. As long as there is no
convincing evidence that vaccination will lead to disease
eradication, it should not become compulsory."

LTO-colleague Sjraar van Beek (sheep): "If we shall vaccinate
voluntarily, all sheep breeders will cooperate; thus, it makes little
difference to us. If Brussels shares the costs of compulsory
vaccination, we would probably support compulsory vaccination."

The Dutch Dairy Farmers Union (NMW) supports tentatively voluntary
vaccination. "We are not able to plea for compulsory vaccination,
since we do not know how the vaccine works," says chairman Peter ten
Hoeve. The NMW, however, does not yet rule out the option of
compulsory vaccination.

[To try eradicate bluetongue by vaccination, all BTV-susceptible
animals -- including wildlife -- throughout the entire affected
region, should be kept immune to the prevailing BTV serotypes,
effectively and permanently. This does not seem to be a realistic
objective.

Vaccination is required to protect susceptible livestock,
particularly sheep, and to minimize losses, the earlier the better. -

[2] UK, Cambridgeshire and Kent
Date: Wed 17 Oct 2007

Defra has today [17 Oct 2007] confirmed that bluetongue has been
found on 2 premises, one near Peterborough, Cambridgeshire and one
near Ashford, Kent. These cases are within the current Bluetongue
Protection Zone.

In line with the UK Bluetongue Control Strategy and EU legislation,
Control Zones have been put in place around these 2 new cases, while
investigations are being undertaken to determine the disease
situation. The existing Protection Zone has also been extended
accordingly [See the official declaration and a map showing the 2 new
control zones at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/bluetongue/pdf/declaration-extend-czpz171007.pdf>.
- Mod.AS].

Fred Landeg, Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer said: "This is obviously
unwelcome news for the farming industry; however, given the nature of
this disease and its means of spread, this is not entirely
unexpected. We will carry out further investigations on these farms
and in the surrounding area to assess the disease situation and
possible sources of incursion. Once again, we are grateful for the
vigilance of farmers in reporting disease and urge them to remain
vigilant. We will continue to work with our core industry group to
assess the disease situation and develop the disease control strategy
in partnership with the farming industry."

[According to Defra's daily update, as of 5:00 pm on 17 Oct 2007,
there were 45 confirmed premises affected by bluetongue in East
Anglia.

It would help to obtain data on the species/breeds affected and on
their clinical status, including morbidity and mortality rates.

The virus continues its spread in the UK, as elsewhere in NW Europe,
by means of an impressively efficient vector. Subscribers wishing to
read more about the vectors potentially involved in the current
spread of BTV-8 throughout the region are referred to the
comprehensive EFSA's entomology expert group's report "Distribution
and dynamics of vector species," at
<http://www.efsa.europa.eu/EFSA/DocumentSet/appx9_bluetongue_S8_en.pdf>.

The said report is appendix 9 of the "Report on Epidemiological
analysis of the 2006 bluetongue virus serotype 8 epidemic in
north-western Europe," published by EFSA on 4 Apr 2007, last updated
19 Jun 2007. - Mod.AS]
