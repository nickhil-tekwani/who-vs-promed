After the deaths of 23 Asiatic lions in Gir forest due to the deadly canine distemper virus (CDV), Gujarat State Forest and Animal Husbandry Departments have jointly started the vaccination of cattle and dogs in 20 nearby villages.

The Forest Department received 300 shots of a vaccine against CDV from the US last week [week of 1 Oct 2018] after top bio-medical research body Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) urged the state government to take immediate steps to save the lions.

"We have decided to vaccinate dogs and cattle in 20 villages as a precautionary measure. The state Animal Husbandry Department is doing the vaccination in consultation with the Forest Department," Chief Conservator of Forests (CCF) of Junagadh wildlife Circle Dushyant Vasavada told Gulf News.

ICMR confirmed that since [12 Sep 2018], as many as 23 lions died in the Gir sanctuary, at least 11 of them due to CDV and protozoan infections. "It is unfortunate because Asiatic lions are the last remaining species which live in the Gir forests of western India," ICHR said in a statement.
33 lions kept in isolation at rescue centres in Jamwala in Gir (West) division and at Babarkot in Amreli social forestry division have already been vaccinated.

"Top lion experts of the world had been consulted before the lions were administered doses of poly-vaccine imported from the US and which gives protection against a host of viruses, including the CDV," Vasavada said.

Additional Chief Secretary of Forest Department Rajiv Kumar Gupta said the vaccine was administered to lions after going through various health reports of the animals.

"The consignment had reached Gir few days ago. We took a call on vaccinating lions after analysing various reports. The 36 lions which were shifted to rescue centres from the forest as a precautionary measure are doing well and stable," Gupta said.

Meanwhile, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani on [Mon 8 Oct 2018] said that lions contracted a "contagious disease" after eating "contaminated food". He said the situation in Gir forest was under control. "We are investigating the issue of the health of lions. A survey of the health of lions and its surrounding areas have been conducted, blood samples of the lions were also taken and the reports are negative. Hence there is no need to worry. Lions are safe in Gujarat and there will not be any relocation," Rupani said.

[The pathogen flow at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface is a major conservation concern, especially where feral dogs are abundant. Documentation of outbreaks in wild carnivores due to exposure to cat and dog pathogens abound throughout the world.

Control of feral dogs and vaccination of owned ones would reduce the sources of the virus.

It is important to consider that canine distemper is not the only pathogen that domestic carnivores can transmit to big cats, and thus conservation efforts should take into account all infectious agents that are potentially flowing at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface in the region.

It is not clear why they are going to vaccinate cattle against CDV. This might be a misunderstanding. - Mod.PMB
