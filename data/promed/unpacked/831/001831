[Following is a message from Dr. Sitaleki A. Finau, contributing to the
discussion on appropriate early warning and responses to outbreaks of
suspected dengue or measles. Thanks to Dr. Finau. I'm simply re-posting
his message for technical reasons. - YS]
As aptly illustrated, the diagnoses [of the two illnesses] grossly overlap
and the facilities for refinement and discrimination are not easily
accessible. Therefore I have often wondered whether we should spend our
time instituting public health measures for both anyway. What ever the
final diagnosis would be, any of the public health and preventive efforts
will not be wasted.
So I am suggesting for the Pacific when dengue and/or measles is suspected
that the epidemic control be directed to both even after there has been
laboratory confirmation. Ideally these public health and preventive
activities should be an ongoing entity but the realities we know just to
well.

[What would be the point in activating epidemic control of measles when an
epidemic is caused by a dengue virus, and vice versa? Why vaccinate
against measles in a dengue outbreak or kill mosquitoes in a measles
outbreak? Measles is controllable by adequate vaccination campaigns,
dengue by vector control. Wouldn't it be better to have well-trained
people using adequate reagents (freely available now) to determine the
etiologic agent of an outbreak of febrile illness with rash and joint
pains? Dr. Finau is correct on one point: It would be best to control both
diseases. It would, of course, be best to control all diseases. - Mod.CHC]
