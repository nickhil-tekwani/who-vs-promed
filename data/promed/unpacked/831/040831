PICS Statement: Increased number of reported cases of novel presentation of multisystem inflammatory disease
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please note this is a statement intended for medical professionals who look after critically ill children.

If you are a parent, please be assured that serious illness as a result of COVID-19 still appears to be a very rare event in children. If your child is unwell or has the symptoms of sepsis, then please seek medical attention in the usual way as set out in guidance from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health:
https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020-04/covid19_advice_for_parents_when_child_unwell_or_injured_poster.pdf

Over the weekend, PICS members received an email alert from NHS England highlighting a small rise in the number of cases of critically ill children presenting with an unusual clinical picture. Many of these children had tested positive for COVID-19, while some had not. The alert indicated "the cases have in common overlapping features of toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters consistent with severe COVID-19 in children. Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms have been a common feature as has cardiac inflammation".

It is important to highlight that, both in the UK and in other countries, there have still been very few cases of critically unwell children with COVID-19 admitted to paediatric intensive care units. However, an early case report relating to COVID-19 presenting as Kawasaki syndrome has been published recently [1], and PICS is aware of a small number of children nationally who appear to fit the clinical picture described in the NHS England alert.

What does this mean in practice? If you are a healthcare professional and see children presenting with a picture of toxic shock or atypical Kawasaki Disease then please discuss this case early with paediatric infectious disease or paediatric critical care teams via your usual pathways (often paediatric retrieval services).

What are "blood parameters consistent with severe COVID-19"? Whilst it is too early to say with confidence, features appear to include high CRP, high ESR and high ferritin. In adults with COVID-19 disease, hyperinflammation or cytokine storm syndrome, as well as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have been described [2].

What is "cardiac inflammation"? Children are presenting with a picture of myocarditis with raised troponin and proBNP. Some have an appearance of their coronary arteries in keeping with Kawasaki Disease. PICS will continue to work with PICAnet and other national organisations to collect accurate data relating to critically ill children presenting to hospital with suspected COVID-19 disease.

[2] Possible COVID-19 related syndrome - pediatric, UK
Date: Mon 27 Apr 2020
Source: HSJ (Health Services Journal) [edited]
https://www.hsj.co.uk/acute-care/exclusive-national-alert-as-coronavirus-related-condition-may-be-emerging-in-children/7027496.article


A serious coronavirus-related syndrome may be emerging in the UK, according to an "urgent alert" issued to doctors, following a rise in cases in the last 2 to 3 weeks, HSJ has learned.

An alert to GPs and seen by HSJ says that in the "last 3 weeks, there has been an apparent rise in the number of children of all ages presenting with a multisystem inflammatory state requiring intensive care across London and also in other regions of the UK".

It adds: "There is a growing concern that a [COVID-19] related inflammatory syndrome is emerging in children in the UK, or that there may be another, as yet unidentified, infectious pathogen associated with these cases."

Little is known so far about the issue, nor how widespread it has been, but the absolute number of children affected is thought to be very small, according to paediatrics sources. The syndrome has the characteristics of serious COVID-19, but there have otherwise been relatively few cases of serious effects or deaths from coronavirus in children. Some of the children have tested positive for COVID-19, and some appear to have had the virus in the past, but some have not.

The fact that very few children have become seriously ill with the virus or died, compared to adults, remains the case.

The alert was issued to GPs in North London by their clinical commissioning group. It has been sent to doctors more widely and is confirmed in a separate "urgent alert" issued last night by the Paediatric Intensive Care Society.

The alert to GPs, marked "significant alert" states: "Please refer children presenting with these symptoms as a matter of urgency."

Both messages said: "The cases have in common overlapping features of toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters consistent with severe COVID-19 in children.

"Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms have been a common feature as has cardiac inflammation. This has been observed in children with confirmed PCR positive SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as children who are PCR negative. Serological evidence of possible preceding SARS-CoV-2 infection has also been observed."

PICS advised "early discussion" of possible cases "with regional paediatric infectious disease and critical care teams".

Simon Kenny, NHS England's national clinical director for children and young people, said: "Thankfully Kawasaki-like diseases are very rare, as currently are serious complications in children related to COVID-19, but it is important that clinicians are made aware of any potential emerging links so that they are able to give children and young people the right care fast.

"The advice to parents remains the same: if you are worried about your child for whatever reason, contact NHS 111 or your family doctor for urgent advice, or 999 in an emergency, and if a professional tells you to go to hospital, please go to hospital."

[The above alerts highlight the prominent clinical presentations including a toxic shock-like presentation or an atypical Kawasaki Disease-like presentation. There seems to be a focus on the Gi presentations.

Kawasaki Disease:
Borrowing from Mod.LL's comment in ProMED-mail post Kawasaki disease - USA: (CA) Archive Number: 20190221.6327795:
"The etiology of this serious inflammatory condition is still unclear. A recent review can be found at:

Ramphul K, Mejias SG: Kawasaki disease: a comprehensive review. Arch Med Sci Atheroscler Dis. 2018;3:e41-e45. Available at:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6374576/

Abstract: Kawasaki disease is an acute systemic vasculitis that was first reported in 1961. Over the last 5 decades, multiple papers have been published to further understand this disease. The diagnosis of Kawasaki disease is made based on the clinical findings. Atypical Kawasaki disease includes patients who do not meet all the criteria for diagnosis. The main complication of Kawasaki disease is coronary aneurysm, and the treatment is intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin. A 2nd dose of immunoglobulin is given if the patient does not improve, and several other treatment options have been proposed over the last few years as 2nd and 3rd line options."

Pediatric toxic shock syndrome:

Toxic Shock Syndrome other than Streptococcal
https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/toxic-shock-syndrome-other-than-streptococcal/case-definition/2011/
Presents with fever, rash, desquamation (skin peels off after 2-3 weeks following rash), hypotension, multisystem involvement (3 or more systems) - gastrointestinal (vomiting/diarrhea), muscular (pain or CPK elevation), mucous membrane, renal (elevated BUN/creatinine), hepatic (elevated ALT, or AST), hematologic (platelets less than 100 000/mm3), CNS (disorientation or alterations in consciousness without focal signs).

Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome
https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/case-definition/2010/
"Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is a severe illness associated with invasive or noninvasive group A streptococcal (_Streptococcus pyogenes_) infection. STSS may occur with infection at any site but most often occurs in association with infection of a cutaneous lesion. Signs of toxicity and a rapidly progressive clinical course are characteristic, and the case fatality rate may exceed 50%."

Clinical Criteria:
An illness with the following clinical manifestations:
Hypotension, multi-organ involvement (2 or more of the following) - renal impairment, (elevated creatinine), coagulopathy (platelets less tan 100 000/mm3 or DIC (prolonged clotting times, low fibrinogen, fibrin degradation products), hepatic (ALT, AST or total bilirubin elevation), ARDS, generalized rash, soft tissue necrosis.

The reference above in the PICS alert -Jones VG, Mills M, Suarez D, et al. COVID-19 and Kawasaki disease: novel virus and novel case. Hosp Pediatr. 2020; doi: 10.1542/hpeds.2020-0123 (https://hosppeds.aappublications.org/content/hosppeds/early/2020/04/06/hpeds.2020-0123.full.pdf) is a case report of a Kawasaki-like disease presentation in a 6-month-old in the USA with positive PCR for COVID-19, and most likely was on the spectrum of disease presenting in the UK, leading up to this alert.

"Abstract: In the midst of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, we are seeing widespread disease burden affecting patients of all ages across the globe. However, much remains to be understood as clinicians, epidemiologists, and researchers alike are working to describe and characterize the disease process while caring for patients at the frontlines. We describe the case of a 6-month-old infant admitted and diagnosed with classic Kawasaki disease (KD), who also screened positive for COVID-19 in the setting of fever and minimal respiratory symptoms. The patient was treated per treatment guidelines, with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and high-dose aspirin (ASA), and subsequently defervesced with resolution of her clinical symptoms. The patient's initial echocardiogram was normal [without any evidence of coronary dilation or aneurysm, no pericardial effusion, and with normal valvar and ventricular function - Mod.ML], and she was discharged within 48 hours of completion of her IVIG infusion, with instruction to quarantine at home for 14 days from the date of her positive testing for COVID-19. Further study of the clinical presentation of pediatric COVID19 and the potential association with KD are warranted, as are the indications for COVID-19 testing in the febrile infant." [Repeat echocardiographic evaluation was scheduled for 2 weeks after discharge, timed to occur after the mandated 14-day quarantine, but results were not given in this report. - Mod.ML]

In the discussion section, the authors mention:
"The cause of KD remains unknown, despite several decades of investigation. Some evidence suggests an infectious trigger, with winter-spring seasonality of the disease, and wave-like spread of Japanese epidemics of KD (4).

"Various studies have described an association between viral respiratory infections and KD, ranging from 9% to as high as 42% of patients with KD testing positive for a respiratory viral infection in the 30-days leading up to the diagnosis of KD (5-7). Interestingly, Turnier et al. in 2015 described that 28% of positive results were attributable to rhinovirus/enterovirus, 8.7% due to parainfluenza, and the remaining pathogens: respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, adenovirus and human coronavirus (strains 229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) were each positive less than 5% of the time (5)." (References for this article are available at its source url.)

More information on the actual clinical spectrum presenting in the UK (and elsewhere), information on the age distribution of the cases, the proportion of cases with positive PCRs for the SARS-CoV-2, proportion with positive serology, and proportion negative by PCR and serology would be very helpful in addition to information on proportion presenting as Kawasaki disease vs toxic shock syndrome, vs a cross-over between the 2 diseases/syndromes to help further define what is being seen. Clearly this is of significant concern as more and more children are being infected with the SARS-CoV2-2 virus globally. - Mod.MPP]
