[re: ProMED-mail Hendra virus, equine - Australia: (NS) 20161223.4720721]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
We would like to clarify some information provided in the comments of the ProMED post in regards to the recent case of Hendra virus in Australia, particularly in relation to the number of cases, role of flying foxes, and the vaccine.

We would like to confirm that this case is the 1st reported case since September 2015. Overall the number of cases of Hendra virus is not increasing. Hendra cases and any exclusion testing are included in the annual Animal Health in Australia report. While there was an increase in cases in 2011-2013, in recent years, cases have been sporadic with only 3 confirmed cases in 2015 and 4 in 2014.

It is unclear what role Cyclone Yasi [3 Feb 2011] and any subsequent change in distribution of flying foxes has had. Many studies have found that neutralising antibodies to Hendra in the 4 endemic species of flying foxes, also known as fruit bats, are geographically widespread in Australia, and predate the earliest equine cases. This is not consistent with the theory that infected flying fox populations from northern Australia spread the disease further south. In addition there is evidence that there is variation between species of flying foxes in the efficiency of shedding and hence their possible role in spill-over disease incidents involving horses. The evidence on the effect of stress on shedding by flying foxes is inconsistent. The current evidence on the epidemiology of this disease was recently reviewed by HE Field in Current Opinion in Virology 2016; 16: 120-5 (available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2016.02.004).

We would also like to confirm that the vaccine (Equivac HeV), that has been available since late 2012, received full registration on 5 Aug 2015. More information on the registration can be found at the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority website [http://apvma.gov.au/node/12871].

We trust that this evidence helps to clarify the information that was provided by the moderator in the comment section of the posting.
