The brother of a Jackson County man who died of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever
is calling attention to the disease. The man died on 21 May 2003 -- his 38th
birthday -- after being declared brain dead and taken off a respirator at
Baptist Montclair in Birmingham.
"He got a tick bite in either DeKalb or Jackson [County], and I just want to
make people aware," the brother said. "We grew up in this area, and it isn't
a big deal to find a tick on you and get it off you. This is here and others
around could get it. I want the residents and doctors of this area to be
aware of the symptoms of this terrible disease."
The patient showed symptoms of a viral infection and was taken to Baptist
DeKalb [hospital]. Baptist DeKalb spokesperson Diane MiMichen could not
confirm or deny the patient's treatment. "He got a fever on 17 May [2003]
and went to the hospital 2 days later," Lea said. "By the next day, he had
pneumonia in one lung. On the following day, he had a rash and a yellow tint.
The doctors ran all kinds of tests for leukemia and hepatitis. Then his
platelets bottomed out. They thought he had a stroke. They put him in the
intensive care unit and decided to send him to Birmingham." Doctors there
asked about a tick bite and put Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever at the top of
their list.
DeKalb County Extension agent Terry Shackelford said the American dog tick is
the most common tick in DeKalb County and is often found on dogs but rarely
on humans. This species is the most common carrier of the disease. He said
ticks are often found in grassy, brushy, wooded and shady areas, and he
advises keeping grass well clipped and removing bushes to allow more sunlight
to penetrate the soil surface.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a tick-borne disease that killed a UNC-CH
[University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill] student last week, is 3 times more
common in North Carolina than in any other state.
A college junior, 19 years old, died 27 May 2003 after returning home to
Panama City, FL, after the spring semester. She likely contracted the
disease, which is rarely fatal, in the Chapel Hill area [located about a 4
hour drive from the Atlantic Ocean. The Research Triangle area of the state
is home not only to UNC-CH but also Duke University in Durham, and North
Carolina State University in Raleigh. - Mod. LL]. North Carolina reported
633 cases of the disease between 1994 and 1998, while the 2nd most affected
state, Oklahoma, had 199 cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.
In the last 5 years, Orange County reported 1 case of the disease to the
State Center for Health Statistics. Because the student was not a permanent
resident, she will not be included in the state's statistics, said Roy Clark
of the SCHS.
Despite its name, the disease is most commonly found in the southeastern
United States. [It was, however, initially characterized in the Rocky
Mountains of the USA by Howard Ricketts about 100 years ago. Ironically, Dr.
Ricketts died from an infection with another rickettsial disease, epidemic
typhus, while studying it in Mexico. - Mod. LL] Nearby states Virginia,
South Carolina and Georgia each reported about 150 cases of it between 1994
and 1998, far more than any other region.
"The entire Piedmont area of North Carolina has the tick that is responsible
for the transmission of Rocky Mountain spotted fever," said Dr. Ed
Breitschwerdt, professor of [small animal] internal medicine & infectious
diseases at NC State University [Veterinary School - Mod.LL]. Breitschwerdt
said that, despite research into tick-borne diseases and their carriers, it
is not known why the disease is more common in North Carolina than any other
state.
Rocky Mountain spotted fever is caused by the bacteria _Rickettsia
rickettsii_. Ticks carry the bacteria and spread them to humans or other
animals by feeding on them. Many people do not notice the presence of a tick
until they find it on their body. [Or they may not be aware of the tick at
all. It takes 12 hours or more of feeding by the female tick -- usually
_Dermacentor sp_ -- for disease transmission to occur.- Mod.LL].
The student's death was unusual for spotted fever infections. Since the
advancement of antimicrobial treatments in the 1940s, the disease is fatal in
only 3-5 percent of reported cases. Prior to the discovery of drugs to treat
the disease, the death rate was about 30 percent. About 5-10 days after
receiving a bite from an infected tick, victims experience a sudden onset of
fever, headache [the headache is usually quite severe. - Mod. LL] and muscle
pain; a rash usually comes after. [The rash begins at the wrists and ankles,
usually on the 3rd day of symptoms and becomes petechial or purpuric. - Mod.
LL] The disease is difficult to diagnose because its [early] symptoms are
common in other diseases.
The student never developed the rash most patients do, making it harder for
doctors to identify her ailment. Her mother said her daughter initially was
diagnosed with the flu at UNC's Student Health Services on 8 May 2003. Later,
doctors in Florida considered leukemia and meningitis. The diagnosis was not
made until 21 May 2003.
The best prevention for spotted fever and other tick-borne diseases is to
avoid areas where the arthopods are common. This includes low-lying brush,
bushes and high grasses. "If you're out running and you're on the middle of
a
path, you're not likely to come into contact with ticks. But if you step off
the path into some bushes to pick blackberries, you're a whole lot likelier
to get a tick on you," Breitschwerdt said.

*****
[The infection does not have a wild animal reservoir; it passes from tick to
tick in the egg. - Mod.JW]
[These cases illustrate the point that clinicians must continue to be on the
lookout for endemic diseases when appropriate epidemiological factors exist.
The North Carolina case represents an unusual presentation and one that is
most difficult to diagnose -- severe RMSF without a rash. The report does
not detail the student's signs and symptoms, but even without the
characteristic rash, a febrile illness with headache and low platelet count
(presumably why meningitis and leukemia were considered) should suggest the
diagnosis. This is not only true in endemic areas such as the Middle
Atlantic states of the USA but also in patients who have recently traveled to
those areas. Cases of RMSF have been reported in most areas of the USA
including New York City. The infection, importantly, does not spread from
person-to-person. - Mod. LL]
