A sudden hailstorm destroyed grape crops across 5000 acres [2023 ha]
in the northeastern parts of the state's vine district of Nashik.

This year [2009] the cost of [grape] production had already increased
30 percent due the attack of downy [mildew] disease on the leaves.

The growers' association has asked farmers to market whatever is left
on the vines because there is a danger of fungal growth.

[Downy mildew on grapevine is caused by the fungus _Plasmopara
viticola_. It causes lesions on leaves, which later become necrotic,
and can also affect flowers and fruits. In years with warm, extended
wet periods during bloom, fruit clusters may be partially or totally
destroyed. The disease can cause severe crop losses. Spores are
spread within a crop mainly by splashing rain, wind, or mechanical
means. The fungus survives between crops on infected plant debris as
oospores, which are formed inside the host tissues. It is an obligate
parasite and cannot be cultured _in vitro_. Disease management relies
mainly on preventative fungicide applications according to
forecasting services, and systemic fungicides are also available.

An outbreak of downy mildew on grapevine has also been reported
recently from the neighbouring state of Karnataka (see ProMED-mail
post no. 20081110.3537). Maharashtra, where the crop is also affected
by the spread of several viruses (see ProMED-mail post no.
20071106.3606), accounts for most of the country's wine production.
