[1] At-home COVID Test

Researchers have developed an at-home, saliva-based testing platform for COVID-19 that is as effective as a PCR test and can provide results in just 45 minutes.

PCR tests are considered the gold standard in detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

However, these tests can take a few days to process, resulting in unnecessary quarantine for negative individuals or delays for those who require proof of negative testing for travel or other commitments.

Rapid antigen-detecting tests, on the other hand, are convenient, but less reliable than PCR tests, according to the researchers.

To bridge the gap between accuracy and convenience, researchers at the Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) in the US developed the test which can detect the virus with the same level of sensitivity as PCR tests.

"PCR test results take about an hour to develop in a lab, but you have to factor in the time it takes to send the sample to a lab and for the lab to process it," said Weihua Guan, an associate professor at Penn State.
"We wanted to create a viable alternative to the PCR for people to use at home, without having to endure the invasive nasal test," said Guan, principal investigator of the study published in the journal ACS Sensors.

The researchers developed a palm-sized testing kit, where an individual spits into a cartridge and inserts it into the processing platform. Within 45 minutes, test results are sent to a custom android app developed by the researchers.

The platform uses a technology called reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification, or RT-LAMP, to detect the virus. In this technology, the testing device first heats the saliva to 95 deg.C [approx. 200 deg.F], the temperature at which viral particle shells break apart and release their genetic material.

The genetic material is then mixed with pre-packaged reagents in a microfluidic cartridge.

The sample is cooled to 65 deg.C [approx. 150 deg.F], triggering another chemical reaction in which a few viral molecules are multiplied into billions of copies, making the virus easier to identify.

If the virus is present in the saliva sample, the user will receive a positive result on their connected smartphone app.

The researchers tested the setup by infusing human saliva samples purchased commercially with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus particles and ran the samples through the prototype.

They also tested a few clinical specimens. The platform accurately determined whether every sample was positive or negative for the virus.

"We tested hundreds of mock samples and controlled the quantity of COVID-19 particles in each one," Guan said.

"Our platform proved to be highly sensitive to the presence of the virus in both the mock and clinical samples, with the standards set by the PCR test as our benchmark," the scientist added.

[It would be good if more than "a few clinical samples" were tested as mock spiked samples are always much cleaner than actual clinical samples. But the ability to test at home is a strong point.

The Cue test is another molecular assay that can be conducted and read at home. Cue's COVID-19 test uses nucleic acid amplification that was found to be equivalent to PCR in an independent study conducted by Mayo Clinic. The assay sample is a nasal swab and the results can be read in 20 minutes. The study found 97.8% agreement between Cue's COVID-19 test and central lab PCR testing. - Mod.LK]

[2] Neutralization breadth

Graham C, Lechmere T, Rehman A, et al. The effect of Omicron breakthrough infection and extended BNT162b2 booster dosing on neutralization breadth against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

Abstract
--------
COVID-19 vaccines are playing a vital role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. As SARS-CoV-2 variants encoding mutations in the surface glycoprotein, Spike, continue to emerge, there is an increased need to identify immunogens and vaccination regimens that provide the broadest and most durable immune responses. We compared the magnitude and breadth of the neutralizing antibody response, as well as levels of Spike-reactive memory B cells, in individuals receiving a 2nd dose of BNT126b2 at a short (3-4 weeks) or extended interval (8-12 weeks) and following a 3rd vaccination approximately 6-8 months later. We show that whilst an extended interval between the first 2 vaccinations can greatly increase the breadth of the immune response and generate a higher proportion of Spike reactive memory B cells, a 3rd vaccination leads to similar levels between the 2 groups. Furthermore, we show that the 3rd vaccine dose enhances neutralization activity against omicron lineage members BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5 and this is further increased following breakthrough infection during the UK omicron wave. These findings are relevant for vaccination strategies in populations where COVID-19 vaccine coverage remains low.

Discussion
-----------
Here we studied the impact of vaccine interval on the breadth and potency of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response. We showed that an extended interval between the 1st and 2nd dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine enhances neutralization breadth initially. However, a 3rd vaccine dose generated a robust and broad neutralizing response against VOCs independent of the interval between 1st and 2nd vaccine doses. It has been extensively reported that 'hybrid' immunity, immunity derived from SARS-CoV-2 infection followed by vaccination, leads to superior neutralization following 1-dose of COVID-19 vaccine [12-16]. Our results showing higher antibody binding and neutralization in previously infected individuals receiving one BNT162b2 dose are consistent with these reports. Here, we show that an extended interval between the 1st and 2nd vaccine dose enhances the immune response in 4 ways. Firstly, and similar to previous reports, there is an increase in IgG binding (ED50) to Spike in the extended booster group following the 2nd immunization [23, 28, 29] and secondly, the Spike-reactive IgG bind with higher avidity [23]. Thirdly, broader neutralizing activity against VOCs (including BA.1) is generated [30, 31]. Finally, a higher percentage of Spike-reactive IgG+ memory B cells is detected in SARS-CoV 2 na√Øve individuals receiving an extended booster. Binding avidity correlated most strongly with the ID50 against the most antigenically distinct VOCs. The higher binding avidity in the extended group suggests that antibodies have undergone higher levels of antibody maturation [21-24]. Indeed, wider SARS-CoV-2 neutralization breadth has been associated with increased somatic hypermutation [12, 32-34]. We have recently reported that mAbs isolated from an individual receiving 2-doses of the ChadOx1 AZD1222 vaccine at a 12-week interval were more highly mutated than those isolated from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors and displayed greater neutralization breadth [32]. Several studies have shown that mRNA vaccination leads to a robust memory B cell response and induces persistent germinal centre reactions that continue for months after primary vaccination [12, 19, 35, 36]. Therefore, a longer interval between the 1st and 2nd vaccine dose would allow extended germinal centre reactions to take place, leading to increased levels of somatic hypermutation and higher affinity to the vaccine antigen.

Abstract
--------
The recently emerged BA.2.75 Omicron sublineage of SARS-CoV-2 identified in numerous countries is rapidly increasing in prevalence in regions of India. Compared with BA.2, the spike protein of BA.2.75 differs in 9 amino acid residues. To determine the impact of the spike mutations on polyclonal and monoclonal antibody activity, we investigated the neutralization sensitivity of BA.2.75 in comparison with B.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.4/5. Analysis of post-boost samples from 30 vaccinated individuals revealed significantly lower serum neutralizing activity against BA.2.75 than against BA.2. However, BA.2.75 was more sensitive to serum neutralization than the widely circulating BA.4/5 sublineages. Moreover, evaluation of 17 clinical-stage monoclonal antibodies demonstrated individual differences in Omicron sublineage activity. Notably, some authorized antibodies with low activity against other Omicron sublineages demonstrated high BA.2.75 neutralizing potency. Our results indicate a less pronounced degree of antibody evasion of BA.2.75 compared with BA.4/5 and suggest that factors beyond immune evasion may be required for an expansion of BA.2.75 over BA.4/5.

[B] BA.2.75 cases
Date: Mon 1 Aug 2022

https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/12-states-with-ba-2-75-cases.html


More than a dozen states have reported cases of the newest omicron subvariant BA.2.75 as of [29 Jul 2022], early disease surveillance data shows.

The subvariant has numerous mutations that may make it more adept than BA. 5, the nation's dominant strain, at spreading quickly and evading immune protection. While it's still unclear whether BA.2.75 will compete against BA.5 or cause more severe illness, some experts contend the subvariant is not the next big one to fret over.

Below is a breakdown of U.S. states reporting BA.2.75 cases, based on a dashboard run by Raj Rajnarayanan, PhD, assistant dean of research and associate professor in the department of basic sciences at the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine at Arkansas State University in Jonesboro. The dashboard uses data from GISAID, a global data-sharing platform for viruses.
