[EIA virus (EIAV) is in the genus _Lentivirus_ in the family Retroviridae, subfamily Orthoretrovirinae. Equine infectious anaemia (EIA) occurs worldwide. The infection, formerly known as swamp fever, is limited to equids. The disease is characterised by recurrent febrile episodes, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, rapid loss of weight, and oedema of the lower parts of the body. If death does not result from one of the acute clinical attacks, a chronic stage develops, and the infection tends to become inapparent.

Once a horse is infected with EIAV, its blood remains infectious for the remainder of its life. This means that the horse is a viraemic carrier and can potentially transmit the infection to other horses. Transmission occurs by transfer of blood from an infected horse. In nature, spread of the virus is most likely via interrupted feeding of bloodsucking horseflies on a clinically ill horse and then on susceptible horses. Transmission can also occur by the iatrogenic transfer of blood through the use of contaminated needles. In utero infection of the fetus may occur. The virus titre is higher in horses with clinical signs, and the risk of transmission is higher from these animals than the carrier animals with a lower virus titre.

EIAV is not considered a risk for human health. Laboratory manipulations should be carried out at an appropriate biosafety and containment level determined by biorisk analysis. http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.06_EIA.pdf. - Mod.CRD
