[1] OIE statement on H5N1 in Hungary
Date: Tue, 30 Jan 2007

The H5N1 avian influenza strain isolated from the outbreak notified by
Hungary is 99.4 percent similar to the strain that infected some countries
of Europe in 2006, the OIE's Reference Laboratory for avian influenza in
Weybridge (UK) confirmed yesterday.
"This information tells us that the genetic characterisation of the virus
isolated in Hungary has still not mutated significantly" Dr Bernard Vallat,
OIE Director General, explained.
Avian and human influenza viruses are known to be able to mutate or
exchange genetic material to form new strains. In certain conditions, these
can be more deadly to both animals and humans.
Since the start of the H5N1 crisis in late 2003, the OIE calls for
increased global monitoring and control measures of the virus at animal
source. Transparent sharing and sequencing of virus samples is also key to
tracking the least genetic evolution of the virus and trigger appropriate
global rapid response mechanisms.

A new outbreak of bird flu is suspected in Japan after 23 birds died at a
poultry farm in the southwestern prefecture of Miyazaki, the Agriculture
Ministry said on Tuesday [30 Jan 2007].
Authorities are conducting preliminary tests on chickens at the farm, which
keeps about 93 000 birds for their eggs, the ministry said in a news release.
If confirmed, it would be the 4th bird flu case reported in Japan since the
beginning of 2007.
On Monday [29 Jan 2007], Japan confirmed its 3rd outbreak of bird flu at a
farm in the western prefecture of Okayama. Further tests are being carried
out to confirm whether that case is due to the lethal H5N1 strain.
There have been no reported cases of human infection from the virus in Japan.
Earlier this month, Japan had 2 H5N1 outbreaks among poultry in Miyazaki,
the country's biggest poultry producing region.
There had been no H5N1 cases in the country for [almost] 3 years.
In 2004, Japan had 4 H5N1 poultry outbreaks between January and March,
including one in Kyoto in western Japan in which 240 000 chickens were
culled and 20 million eggs destroyed.
Last week, authorities in Hong Kong confirmed a 3rd case of H5N1 virus
found in dead birds, while 6 people have died of bird flu in Indonesia
since 1 Jan 2007.
