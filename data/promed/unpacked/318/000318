Private veterinarians were surprised by the news that 20 dogs from the Ipoh
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ISPCA) would be put down
after testing positive for the Nipah virus.
Expressing his skepticism, a veterinarian, who did want to be named, has
questioned the accuracy of the ELISA test conducted by the Centres for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta to detect the Nipah virus.
He said the blood samples of two private-owned dogs had been sent by two
local veterinarians to be tested together with the blood samples of the
ISPCA dogs and cats and that both animals had tested positive.
He said the two dogs in question were neither near the Nipah high-risk
area, nor were they ever at ISPCA.
"We want to know the specificity of the Nipah test conducted by the CDC. "I
suspect that the blood samples of all the 20 dogs might have shown positive
because of a cross reaction between the Nipah virus antigen used for the
test and the vaccine viruses normally given to dogs once a year.
"The six-in-one distemper vaccination given to dogs has six vaccine viruses
of which three are of the paramyxovirus type," he said.
Another veterinarian said the ISPCA was located far from the Nipah
high-risk areas of Tambun, Ampang and Ulu Piah.
The CDC officer stationed in the country declined to comment.
