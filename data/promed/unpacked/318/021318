Squirrel pox is spreading fast along the Solway coast, affecting the population of red squirrels in the area. The virus is carried by grey squirrels - they are not affected by the disease but are capable of contaminating native reds that are not immune.

In recent weeks a number of red squirrels have died as a result of the disease. Those with pox [squirrel pox] resemble rabbits with Myxomatosis. A list of symptoms include skin ulcers, lesions, scabs, swelling and discharge from the lesions/scabs near the eyes, mouth, feet, and genitalia. Within 2 weeks, the squirrel dies from the virus.

Saving Scotland's Red Squirrels (SSRS) say wildlife feeder boxes and garden bird tables increase the risk of squirrel pox transmission as they bring squirrels of both species into closer contact with one another. While the virus is initially spread by grey squirrels, once it has entered the red squirrel population, red-to-red transmission is more likely to happen.

People living in areas with pox outbreaks are advised to refrain from feeding the wildlife. Those living in outbreak-free areas are asked by the SSRS to regularly disinfect feeders with an anti-viral solution to prevent break-outs.

[Squirrel pox is a viral disease that only affects squirrels. It is caused by a parapoxvirus that circulates naturally in gray and fox squirrel populations in eastern North America. Infection with this virus results in a fatal disease in red squirrels (_Sciurus vulgaris_), and it has resulted in extensive die-offs in the UK after its introduction in the island by grey squirrels (_Sciurus carolinensis_) from North America, which rarely die from the disease.

This virus was the main contributor to the red squirrel decline observed in Britain in the last 2 decades. Dispersal of grey squirrels in Ireland has been slower than that experienced in England and Wales. Until now, the disease was mainly found in England and Wales, sporadically in Scotland, and only a few years ago in Northern Ireland and Ireland, and not elsewhere in the Red Squirrel's European range.
