Dengue fever scare plagues Bangalore
----------------------------------
Even as reports of deaths caused by dengue fever are coming in from
neighbouring Tumkur, hospitals in Bangalore have begun receiving several
cases of suspected dengue fever, causing an alarm among the public as well
as health officials.

The disease, which is caused by mosquitoes breeding in stagnant water,
commonly occurs after the monsoon has set in. People afflicted with dengue
show symptoms of fever, lower back ache, pain in the calf muscles and, in
some cases, nasal bleeding.

More than 50 patients have been admitted to Manipal Hospital in the city
for suspected dengue fever during the last couple of weeks. Even the St
Philomena's Hospital received several cases of suspected dengue fever.
Though no deaths on account of dengue have been reported in Bangalore, 5
patients are undergoing treatment for the same at St Philomena's Hospital.

"This is only the beginning. An increase in the number of cases can be seen
in the next 3 months after heavy rains have set in", say medical experts.

St. Johns Medical Hospital has confirmed one case of dengue fever reported
to them last week.

Continued dengue rise in North Cotabato blamed on uncooperative residents
--------------------------------------------------
Health authorities renewed their call on local government officials and
residents to help counter the increasing incidence of dengue, a disease
likely fatal in children.

The North Cotabato provincial dengue control and prevention division has
urged the 17 town mayors to help in their campaign against dengue.

Dra. Perlita Albano, the health officer of Kidapawan City, has attributed
the increase of dengue cases in the city's 3 barangays to the lack of
cooperation among residents, especially the implementation of 4 o'clock
habit in their areas. [From posting 20050519.1375: "..the 4 o'clock habit
... involved cleaning surroundings, draining of water accumulated in tires,
bottles, flower vases, and roof gutters to prevent mosquitoes from breeding."]

Kidapawan City posted the highest incidence of dengue [within the province
of North Cotabato. - Mod.RY].

Jun Mancao, dengue control and prevention in-charge of the province's
Department of Health [DOH], told DXND Radio for Peace that his office has
noted a dramatic rise of dengue cases in various town of the province.

DOH records show that 673 cases of confirmed dengue patients were admitted
in 5 government hospitals from January to June of the 2005. Kidapawan City
ranked number one with total cases of 189 cases, with 2 fatalities.

The remaining 484 cases were documented in the towns of M'lang, Matalam,
Makilala, Tulunan, and President Roxas in the 2nd district and in the town
of Banisilan, Pigcawayan and Midsayap.

Albano said the city's private hospitals reported 32 dengue patients in
June 2005, and that the majority came from Barangays Poblacion, Nuangan and
Ilomavis.

"We conduct inspections in these places, and we found breeding places of
mosquitoes, which is possibly the reason why increases in dengue cases in
these 3 barangays were noted," Albano told a regular session of the
Sangguniang Panglungsod.

Councilor Jonares John Amador passed a resolution asking City Mayor Rodolfo
Gantuangco to allocate funds for the massive information campaign in the
grassroots level.

His resolution said the city would tap non-government organizations, public
and private schools, barangay officials and all media organizations in the
city to help educate the residents on how to combat the deadly dengue fever.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III has told a television interviews said
that there were 5396 dengue patients in various government hospitals
nationwide from January to 15 Jun 2005. There were 77 fatalities nationwide.

Duque attributed the increase to the onset of rainy season, with water
accumulated in junked tin cans, bottles, uncovered containers and clogged
gutters serving as breeding places for mosquitoes.

Dengue fever is a disease [spread] by _Aedes aegypti_, a day-biting
mosquito. Symptoms of dengue include fever, rashes, severe headache, muscle
and joint pains, loss of appetite and vomiting.

He said that the participation of the local authorities would significantly
reduce dengue cases.

Sec. Duque said the regions with the highest number of dengue cases were
Northern Mindanao with 1 242 cases, National Capital Region with 965 cases,
Caraga with 683 cases, and Central Luzon, with 603, and Central Visayas
with 579 cases.

Rise in dengue: CMC inspects montessories
---------------------------------------
Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) began inspecting City montessories from
yesterday for mosquito breeding grounds following a rise in the number of
dengue cases. "The number of dengue affected children who are below 5 years
has shown a 50 per cent rise in the City," said Dr. Pradeep Kariyawasam,
the CMC's Chief Medical Officer, explaining the clean-up drive at montessories.

"However, the number of schoolchildren has shown a reduction of 50 per
cent," Kariyawasam said. The CMC authorities yesterday renewed its warning
to residents to be alert to the spread of dengue amid 3 infant deaths
within a month. [A "Google" search of the web reveals that montessories
are for pre-school age children in Sri Lanka. Hence, it is not
inconsistent to have a newswire mention a 50 percent rise in cases among
montessori attendees but a 50 percent reduction of cases among school aged
children in Colombo. - Mod.MPP]

They revealed that opulent areas in Colombo such as Cinnamon Gardens,
Bambalapitiya, Kollupitiya, Havelock Town areas are high-risk areas, where
most cases were reported.

"Those 3 children were under 5 years. They were from the heart of Colombo
city including Longdon Place and Central Colombo," CMC Chief Medical
Officer Dr. Pradeep Kariyawasam told the Daily News yesterday.

The CMC's warning comes as the Epidemiological Department reports confirm
that the highest number of dengue patients are reported from Colombo and
its suburbs. "Overall, the number of total cases [so far in 2005] has shown
a 30 per cent reduction compared to [2004]," added D. Kariyawasam.

Meanwhile, Director of the Epidemiology Unit of the Healthcare and
Nutrition Ministry Dr. Nihal Abeysinghe said islandwide, dengue cases have
reduced by 60 per cent. Only 1715 cases have been reported so far [in
2005], while [for the same period of 2004] it was 15 000 cases.

The highest number of cases have been reported from Colombo, Gampaha, and
Kalutara, while a significant number of cases have been reported from
Kandy, Matara, Ratnapura and Kurunegala. They have launched several
prevention programs to eradicate the spread of dengue. The Municipal
authorities are taking stern action against households and institutions who
fail to clean up their environments. Under this, residents who fail to
clean up their environment face the risk of prosecution within 48 hours.

So far this year, the Municipal officials have filed 132 Court cases
against those who failed to adhere to Municipal regulations, while
attributing the increase of dengue cases to the rapid urbanisation and poor
attention to keep one's environment clean.

Dengue Fever Hits Jeddah; 20 Suffer
---------------------------------
More than 20 residents of Al-Muntazahat District in Jeddah have come down
with Dengue fever, the Arabic language daily newspaper, Al-Madina, reported.

The victims belong to 5 families living in close proximity. The owner of a
nearby building under construction, as well as its janitor and architect,
have also contracted the disease.

All patients are suffering from stomach pains, extremely high fever and
diarrhea. According to a source at the Ministry of Health, Dengue fever is
endemic in the districts of the Western Province.

Individuals who have come down with the disease have accused Jeddah
Municipality of being lax in spraying insecticides to exterminate
mosquitoes, which are the prime carriers of the disease.

Sources at the Environmental Health Department said that they have informed
municipal officials that Dengue fever is suspected.

[One male patient] said that he contracted the fever first, then his 2
wives. Ultimately he was admitted to hospital for more than 6 days, while
his 2 wives and children are still at King Fahd Military Hospital. "All of
my neighbors of all age groups have come down with the disease," he said.

[Another male patient -- a retiree --] said that he and his 8 children have
come down with the disease. A private hospital had diagnosed the case as
ordinary fever.

[Yet a 3rd patient] said that the virus has spread in their neighborhood
due to the accumulating litter and the fact that sewage water and drinking
water have mixed.

Awad Al-Maleki, an official at the Environmental Health Department in
Jeddah Governorate, said that the municipality is systematically spraying
all districts in Jeddah.

"We will also spray the district where the disease broke out in its
entirety this evening as a precautionary measure," he added.

The Head of Health Affairs in Jeddah, as well as his assistant for
preliminary health care Dr. Ashraf Al-Amir, could not be contacted to
comment on the issue.

Vietnam reports 10 000 dengue fever cases
---------------------
At least 10 000 people in Vietnam's southern Mekong Delta have been
infected with dengue fever so far this year, of whom 13 died.

From 6 Jun to 7 Jul [2005], the country detected some 3 300 dengue fever
patients, including 10 fatalities, according to local newspaper Saigon
Liberation on Friday [8 Jul 2005].

Most of local sufferers are from southern localities such as the provinces
of Soc Trang, Dong Thap, Hau Giang and Bac Lieu, whose weather is most
favorable for the development of mosquitoes -the disease's transmitter.

To minimize the number of new infections, local health workers are
encouraging residents to kill mosquitoes and their larvae moreactively.
More chemicals used to kill the insect are given to the residents.

Vietnam reported 73 300 cases of dengue fever infections, including 101
fatalities last year, up 108 percent and 74 percent against the year
earlier, respectively.
