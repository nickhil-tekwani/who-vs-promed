According to Dr Alex Barekye, Kacwekano Agricultural Research and Development Institute, potato late blight disease has increased in intensity in recent years due to high humidity and rainfall and has ravaged most farms across the south-western (Kigezi) region. Many fear that at the current speed, the disease could wipe out potato farming from the region, if not addressed.

Since the disease was identified in the region 20 years ago, farmers have been using fungicides to bring it under control as well as rotating the crops. Now, farmers say fungicides are no longer effective. The problem is compounded by the fact that the disease does not spare seed potato producers. But Ugandan scientists have developed a variety that is able to resist the fungal infection for many years and that requires no spraying.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 per cent crop loss. The pathogen can also affect tomato and some other solanaceous crops. In potato, it affects leaves as well as tubers; in tomato, it causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems, and fruits. The disease is favoured by cool, moist conditions. It can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

PLB is spread by plant material (including plant debris and volunteer crop plants), mechanical means (including human and insect activities), wind and water. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen reservoirs, crop rotation, preventive fungicide treatments of planting material and fungicide sprays of crops.

Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide. More virulent strains with additional fungicide resistances and increased yield losses are emerging frequently. Farm saved or uncertified seed tubers have often been reported as sources of PLB outbreaks in the past. Thus, seed tuber certification schemes have been set up in many countries. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen. Clean planting stock (potato seed tubers, tomato seeds, or explants) and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are considered vital to control PLB outbreaks in the future.

From the report above it appears that a new strain may have emerged in the region with resistance to locally used fungicides. No information is provided on the newly developed PLB resistant potato cultivar, but it can be expected that other measures such as seed tuber certification and fungicide management programmes will still be required.
