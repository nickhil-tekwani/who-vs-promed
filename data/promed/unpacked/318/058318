MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE UPDATE 2007 (04)

We want to make few comments on meningococcal disease in Uganda:
12 or 13 meningococcal serogroups (capsular groups) are known and, among
them, serogroup A, B, C, W135 and Y represent most of those involved in
meningococcal meningitis over the world. Monovalent _Neisseria
meningitidis_ antisera against these serogroups are available, they can
determine the serogroup of meningococci only if the strains are cultured.
In our opinion, polyvalent sera (XYZ) is not appropriate to group
meningococci, as it cannot determine accurately the group of the
isolate. So in Uganda, we cannot know if serogroup X, Y or Z is involved
in the cases, probably isolates are serogroup X but serogroup Y is also
(rarely) isolated in Africa.
At this moment following the epidemiology in the African meningitis belt or
in countries were meningococcal epidemics happen frequently we suggest to
reference laboratories to, at minimum, acquire monovalent typing sera
against A, W135 and X. Results of grouping will permit following the WHO
decisional tree and to choose the adapted vaccine (AC or ACW).
We want also give our experience in Niger in 2006 (from Niamey, Niger) and
the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Meningococci in
Marseille (France):
Serogroup X meningococcus is well known and has been isolated since 1970 in
Africa. It was responsible for sporadic cases and small epidemics in the
90s (83 cases in Niger in 1997). In 2006 in Niger, 4185 meningitis cases
were reported between Jan and Jun 2006. _N. meningitidis_ group X
represented 51 percent of 1139 laboratory-confirmed meningococcal
meningitis, but in southwestern Niger, it represented 90 percent. Among the
18 serogroup X isolates characterized in Marseille, 16 had the same
phenotype (X:NT:P1.5, nontypeable and subtype P1.5) and 2 were NT:NST
(non-typeable, non-subtypeable), 16 belonged to the same sequence-type
(ST)-181 as the serogroup X isolates circulating in Niamey in the 1990s and
2 to the ST-5789 (one locus difference from ST-181).
This was the 1st report of such a high incidence of serogroup X
meningitis. E-test technique was used to test the antibiotic
susceptibilities of the 18 serogroup X isolates; all were susceptible to
ampicillin, ceftriaxone and chloramphenicol. So although there is not
available vaccine for serogroup X meningococci, using the results obtained
in 2006 in Niger, serogroup X meningococcal meningitis cases can be treated
as it is usually done using chloramphenicol, ampicillin or ceftriaxone.
If possible, it would be interesting to characterize those isolates from
Uganda and check their antibiotic susceptibilities at WHO reference
laboratory in Marseille France. Please contact <nicolasp@imtssa.fr> or
<meningo@imtssa.fr> to send meningococcal isolates from
Uganda. Meningococcus isolates from other countries are also welcome.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Nicolas for his comments. Serogroups (capsular types)
of meningococci can be further characterized by serotypes and subtypes as
mentioned based on class 2/3 and class 1 outer membrane proteins
(OMPs). These OMPs are porin proteins, water-filled channels that play
important roles as molecular sieves in the outer membranes of Gram-negative
bacteria. The class 1 protein (_porA_) is the source of the serogroup B OMP
vaccines that are under study. - Mod.LL]
