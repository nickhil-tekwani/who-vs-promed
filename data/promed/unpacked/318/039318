Zimbabwe: Malaria Outbreak in Goromonzi
---------------------------------------
A total of 11 people have died of malaria while 846 others have been
treated for the killer disease in Goromonzi West.

According to reports 909 cases have been recorded so far. The
affected areas are Maiden of Svisva, Svisva 1 and 2 and Chabwino
compound in Goromonzi West Constituency.

Councillor Miriam Chipunza yesterday said health facilities are too
far from their area and they are appealing for mobile facilities to
rescue them. Clr Chipunza said the villagers were concerned that the
outbreak could claim more victims before the necessary steps are taken
to arrest it.

Dr Steven Karima, the district medical officer for Goromonzi,
confirmed the outbreak. "I can confirm that there is a malaria
outbreak in Goromonzi and we have since responded to 909 cases. We
have treated 846 patients and 178 of them were positive meaning they
had malaria parasites," he said.

Dr Karima said mobile clinics were visiting the area everyday. "We
have sent a proposal to the province so as to launch a full programme
supplying treated nets, spraying as well as biolarvicide for
prevention." Dr Kurima said

Goromonzi used to be a malaria free zone but it shares borders with
Mudzi, Shamva and Murehwa that are confirmed malaria zones. "Villagers
now fear that the malaria zone extending into their area would claim
lives hence there is need for the responsible authorities to react
immediately," he said.

National malaria control manager in the Ministry of Health and Child
Welfare, Dr Joseph Mberikunashe, also confirmed the outbreak in
Mashonaland East. "Yes there is malaria outbreak in Goromonzi, Mudzi,
Mutoko and UMP and we have received the death cases but it is now
under control since our team is now on the ground.

"Goromonzi was once a malaria free zone but zones change due the
climate change and travelling," he said. Dr Mberikunashe added that 60
000 cases of malaria have been detected in the country since the end
of last year up to date.

Areas above 1500 meters [4921 feet] such as Harare are usually
malaria free, while areas below 900 meters [2953 feet] are normally a
high risk to malaria, particularly in the north of the altitude is
between 900 - 1500 meters.

After HIV/AIDS, malaria is the biggest killer of children under 5 in
Zimbabwe and pregnant women as well as newborns.

According to research, the main challenge to the spread of malaria is
because there is no single way of preventing malaria and mosquitoes.
Malaria is increasingly becoming resistant to existing drugs. Efforts
have been made to introduce an effective vaccine and the most
effective way to reduce malaria so far is prevention through use of
insecticide-treated nets.

[It is correct that Goromonzi, about 20 miles [32 km] east of Harare,
previously was considered malaria free. Whether the introduction of
malaria is due to climate change or travelers -- as suggested here --
remains conjectual. Alternative explanations are reduced focus on
control measures like reduction of possible breeding sites and
insufficient use of impregnated bed nets.
