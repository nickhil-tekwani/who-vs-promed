Merck and the United Nations-based Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) today [Wed 27 Oct 2021] announced a licensing deal that will allow pharmaceutical companies in other countries to make molnupiravir --an investigational antiviral to treat COVID-19-- a step that would ease access in low- and middle-income countries.

Results from promising clinical trials suggest that the drug, the first oral treatment of its kind for COVID-19, could be an important tool for cutting hospitalizations and deaths. Fearing a repeat of the inequitable global rollout of COVID-19 vaccine, global health experts have worried that molnupiravir would be inaccessible and expensive for lower-income countries.

Under the agreement terms, Merck (or MSD, of Kenilworth, New Jersey), Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, and Emory University will not receive sales royalties for molnupiravir as long as COVID-19 is considered a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO).

In a statement, Charles Gore, MPP's executive director, said "This transparent, public health-driven agreement is MPP's first voluntary license for a COVID-19 medical technology, and we hope that MSD's agreement with MPP will be a strong encouragement to others." [https://medicinespatentpool.org/news-publications-post/mpp-msd-new-licence-announcement-molnupiravir/]

Earlier this month, Merck submitted an application to the US Food and Drug Administration for the drug to be used under emergency use authorization for mild-to-moderate COVID-19, and European regulators this week announced they are speeding its review.

The WHO and the global health group UNITAID issued a statement welcoming the signing of the voluntary licensing agreement, which they called a positive step toward creating broader access by allowing generic makers to prepare supplies and create more affordable versions of the drug. [https://www.who.int/news/item/27-10-2021-who-unitaid-statement-on-the-mpp-licensing-agreement-for-molnupiravir]

They said the agreement will speed availability in 105 low- and middle-income countries, but added that they hope other key countries can soon be added to the agreement's scope.

Also, the groups urged Merck to provide clinical trial data to the WHO as soon as possible to allow evaluation and emergency listing to move forward, and they pushed other companies developing vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics to consider similar open and transparent licenses as soon as possible.

Doctors Without Borders (MSF) today [Wed 27 Oct 2021] said though the agreement is the first of its kind, it doesn't go far enough. In a statement, Yuanqiong Hu, JD, senior legal and policy advisor for MSF's Access Campaign, said the agreement is a welcome step forward, but it's disappointing that it excludes key upper-income countries such as Brazil and China, both of which have manufacturing capacity and have been hit hard by the pandemic. [https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/news/msf-merck-and-medicines-patent-pool-license-new-covid-19-drug]

Hu also said the license contains an unacceptable clause, put in place by original patent-holder Emory University, that limits the right to challenge molnupiravir patents. She said the clause could stifle production and supply of generics and is problematic, because molnupiravir's development was heavily funded by the US government. ...

[Molnupiravir is an investigational, orally administered form of a potent ribonucleoside analog that inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Molnupiravir has been shown to be active in several preclinical models of SARS-CoV-2, including for prophylaxis, treatment, and prevention of transmission. Additionally, pre-clinical and clinical data have shown molnupiravir to be active against the most common SARS-CoV-2 variants. (https://tinyurl.com/88uz5rcs)

The Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) is a United Nations-backed public health organization working to increase access to, and facilitate the development of life-saving medicines for low- and middle-income countries. Through its innovative business model, MPP partners with civil society, governments, international organizations, industry, patient groups, and other stakeholders, to prioritize and license needed medicines and pool intellectual property to encourage generic manufacture and the development of new formulations.

[2] Cases decline in children

For the 7th consecutive week, COVID-19 infections in Americans kids have declined, according to the latest update from the American Academy of Pediatrics. [https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/]

Nearly 118 000 child COVID-19 cases were reported from [14 Oct to 21 Oct 2021], which is down significantly from the pandemic peak of nearly 252 000 child cases documented during the first week of September [2021]. As of [21 Oct 2021], 6.3 million American kids have tested positive for the virus, representing 16.5% of all US cases.

In related news, hospital admissions are declining sharply among US children with COVID-19, Bloomberg reports. Daily pediatric admissions involving confirmed COVID have fallen 56% since the end of August [2021], to an average of about 0.2 per 100 000, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-26/pediatric-covid-hospital-visits-plunge-in-u-s-as-schools-reopen]

The promising numbers come 1 day after the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) vaccine advisory board gave the green-light to Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine for children ages 5 -- 11. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) advisory panel is slated to consider the vaccine early next week, with shots beginning as soon as the end of the following week if both the FDA and CDC recommend the vaccine. [https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/10/fda-panel-green-lights-pfizer-covid-vaccine-young-kids]

The drop in pediatric cases reflects an overall path toward US recovery from the 4th wave of virus activity, which has been primarily caused by the delta (B1617.2) variant. New coronavirus infections have dropped nearly 60% since the delta-fueled surge peaked in September [2021], according to data compiled by the Washington Post. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/10/27/covid-delta-variant-live-updates/].

Today [Wed 27 Oct 2021] White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said the United States will by the end of today have put 400 million shots in arms since [1 Jan 2021]. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, said the country was "now heading in the right direction, but needs to remain vigilant heading into cold, drier months."

Walensky said the 7-day average for new daily cases was 65 900, down 16% from the prior week. She also said the current average of new hospital admissions for COVID-19 was 5500 per day, which is a 40% decrease from the delta peak seen at the end of August [2021].

The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows 57.5% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 66.5% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 7.2% of fully vaccinated people have received a booster shot. [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total]

Also, immunocompromised people may now receive a 4th dose of COVID-19 vaccine 6 months after receiving their 3rd dose, Axios reports. For this group the first 3 shots of vaccine are considered the primary series of vaccines, and the 4th shot is a booster. [https://www.axios.com/cdc-immunocompromised-covid-fourth-shot-1b47635c-c464-4d29-9832-3d94ea1cecf9.html]

A new poll shows that not all Americans consider boosters safe, however. In a survey examining racial differences in attitudes toward vaccines, 80% of Asian and White respondents said they'd be willing to get a vaccine booster, compared with just 53% of Black and 59% of Hispanic respondents. Black and Hispanic poll respondents showed more distrust of COVID vaccines in general than White peers: 78% of White respondents believe the COVID-19 vaccine is safe, compared with 66% of Hispanic and 58% of Black respondents.

- A federal judge in Texas yesterday denied a request by the Southwest Airlines pilots union to block the vaccine mandate for employees, which is required under rules issued by the Biden administration, according to CNBC. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/26/federal-judge-rejects-southwest-airlines-pilots-request-to-block-vaccine-mandate.html]

- Trump administration coronavirus adviser Deborah Birx, MD, told congressional investigators earlier this month [October 2021] that the administration could have prevented 30% -- 40% of the 738 000 COVID-19 deaths in the United States if it had taken the necessary steps to curb the spread of the virus, Newsweek reported yesterday [Tue 26 Oct 2021].

[It is good news pediatric cases are declining in number, but still the number of cases is high, i.e., nearly 118 000 child COVID-19 cases reported from 14 Oct to 21 Oct 2021. In the US, kids testing positive represent 16.5% of all US cases (or nearly 6.3 million COVID cases since the pandemic began). Depending on how the media present these current data, parents may become more reluctant to allow their kids to be vaccinated. - Mod.LK]

[3] Allergic reactions after vaccination
Date: Wed 27 Oct 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/10/study-nearly-all-severely-allergic-people-tolerate-covid-vaccines


While healthcare workers at a Boston healthcare system with severe allergies reported more reactions after receiving a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, nearly all were able to safely complete the series, according to an observational study yesterday in JAMA Network Open. [Li L, Robinson LB, Patel R, et al. Association of Self-reported High-Risk Allergy History With Allergy Symptoms After COVID-19 Vaccination. JAMA Netw Open. 2021;4(10):e2131034. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.31034, https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2785466]

Researchers at Mass General Brigham and Harvard Medical School mined the electronic health records of 52 998 employees, of whom 97.6% received both doses of vaccine, and 0.9% reported a history of high-risk allergy. The study period was [14 Dec 2020] to [1 Feb 2021]. Participants completed a prevaccination allergy risk assessment and at least one postvaccination symptom survey during the 3 days after vaccination. Current contraindications to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination include a history of severe or immediate allergic reactions to any vaccine component or to a previous dose of an mRNA vaccine. The employees, however, were given the vaccine according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, allergist consultation, risk stratification, and shared decision-making.

Allergic symptoms emerged more often after the first rather than the 2nd dose. Most symptoms were mild (eg, rash, itching), at 2.7%, but respiratory symptoms (1.3%), hives (0.9%), and angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, eyes, or tongue) (0.6%) were also reported.

Severe allergic reactions were rare (0.3%). Of the 140 participants who reported severe allergic symptoms after vaccination, 4.3% had a history of high-risk allergy. The risk of a severe allergic reaction after vaccination was 1.3% among workers with a high-risk allergy history and 0.3% among those who had never had a high-risk reaction.

Relative to workers without allergies, those with severe allergies had more reactions after receiving one or 2 vaccine doses (11.6% vs 4.7%). After adjustment, high-risk allergy was tied to increased risk of reactions (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 2.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.92 -- 3.16). Risks were highest for hives (aRR, 3.81; 95% CI, 2.33 -- 6.22) and angioedema (aRR, 4.36; 95% CI, 2.52 -- 7.54).

"However, reported allergy symptoms did not impede the completion of the 2-dose vaccine protocol among a cohort of eligible health care employees, supporting the overall safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine," the study authors wrote.

Participants were, on average, 42 years old, and 72% were women. Women and Black participants made up much higher proportions of those with a history of severe allergy than those with no history of allergy (80.8% vs 71.9% and 9.5% vs 4.8%, respectively).

Severely allergic vaccinees were older than those with no allergy history (46 vs 42 years on average), had more atopic (allergic) skin conditions (16.7% vs 8.7%), anxiety (28.9% vs 23.9%), high blood pressure (14.6% vs 10.9%), and cancerous tumors (4.0% vs 2.4%).

Participants at highest risk of allergic reactions to the vaccine were Black (RR, 1.69), had a higher Charlson comorbidity index score (RR, 1.04), and received the Moderna rather than the Pfizer vaccine (RR, 1.49). Compared with women, men were at decreased risk for a reaction (RR, 0.66).

Among 474 employees with a history of severe allergy, 46.6% had a previous reaction to an unknown or known allergen (eg, food, venom, drug, latex). Nearly 46% of these workers reported a previous severe allergic reaction to an injectable medication or vaccine. Only 1.9% had a previous severe allergic reaction to polyethylene glycol (PEG) (an inert vaccine ingredient) or PEG-containing products (eg, Miralax, injectable steroid).

Soon after the US Food and Drug Association issued an emergency use authorization for the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna in December 2020, several severe allergic reactions were reported, raising concerns about vaccine safety, the researchers noted.

Since then, the reported rate of allergic reactions to these vaccines has been about 2%, and anaphylaxis (a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction) has been estimated to occur in 0.025 -- 2.47 cases per 10 000 vaccinations--or a 0.02% risk on the high end of that range. Of vaccinees who experienced anaphylaxis after vaccination, about a 3rd had a history of the reaction.

Whether severe allergies are linked to allergic reactions after mRNA vaccination is still unclear, the authors noted, because the observed reactions may not be true allergies. People with a history of severe allergy to PEG should consult their allergist or immunologist before seeking COVID-19 vaccination; such an allergy may not be a contraindication for vaccination.

"Identification of risk factors for allergy symptoms after COVID-19 vaccination will guide safe vaccination practices for individuals at the highest risk and inform strategies that target vaccine hesitancy that is associated with allergy concerns," the researchers wrote.

Overall, the results are reassuring for people who have a history of severe allergy, senior author Kimberly Blumenthal, MD, said in a Massachusetts General Hospital news release.

"We hope these data will help inform ongoing conversations with patients who are hesitant to receive COVID-19 vaccination due to allergy concerns," she said. "At our institutions, nearly all individuals with and without a history of high-risk allergy were able to complete the 2-dose vaccine series."

[New research addresses ongoing concerns regarding risks of allergic reactions after receiving mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, particularly for individuals with a history of severe allergic reactions. The JAMA Network Open study of employee vaccinations within the Mass General Brigham health care system revealed that although people with such a history reported more allergic symptoms after vaccination, nearly all of them were able to become fully vaccinated.

The findings provide reassurance regarding the safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in individuals regardless of allergy history. "We hope these data will help inform ongoing conversations with patients who are hesitant to receive COVID-19 vaccination due to allergy concerns," says senior author author Kimberly G. Blumenthal, MD, MSc, co-director of the Clinical Epidemiology Program within Massachusetts General Hospital's Division of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology.
