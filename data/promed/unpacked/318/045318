The discovery of at least 7 dead monkeys in a forested area in El
Soberbio, Misiones province, reignited an alert for the reappearance
of yellow fever [YF] in the region, for which the [health]
authorities initiated monitoring and revaccination tasks in the area.

The animals, of the [_Alouatta] caraya_ species [black howler
monkeys], were found dead Monday afternoon [20 Oct 2008] by park
guards of the Pinalito Provincial Park, who immediately informed the
provincial Ministry of Public Health.

The subsecretary for health, Carlos Baez, told Telam that, "The
vaccination task has never been abandoned, but just the same we are
carrying out a reevaluation in order to determine what percentage of
the population at risk still has not been vaccinated."

The official added that although it hasn't been confirmed yet that
the monkeys died of yellow fever, he recognized that the area in
which they were found is considered one of [YF] risk.

The outbreak of this tropical disease was detected at the beginning
of the year [2008], having begun in the same area and discovered due
to the finding of 10 dead monkeys, which eventually were confirmed
infected with yellow fever [virus].

In addition, the disease caused the death of a forest worker who
resided in a rural area of San Vicente, and infected 6 other people
of the region, whose lives were saved due to immediate medical
attention that they received in the assistance centers of the area.

Now, the main task of the health authorities is to continue
vaccination and to make the population at risk aware of the need to
eradicate the vector mosquito through spraying and disinfection, Baez
emphasized.

[It is not surprising that YF virus transmission is again detected in
this area, since it has been circulating there since the beginning of
this year (2008) and in nearby areas of Brazil and Paraguay -- see
ProMED refs. below.

The howler monkeys mentioned here are susceptible YF virus hosts, and
frequently die of the infection. Local residents in neotropical
forests know that when the forest falls silent because the howler
monkey are dead, yellow fever virus likely is present in the area.

Health authorities are taking prudent measures in carrying out a
proactive vaccination effort in this area, knowing the YF virus is
being transmitted there. Reducing vector mosquito populations is also
wise. Reducing the YF virus vector, _Aedes aegypti_, populations in
houses and other buildings is prudent, although spraying will provide
only temporary reduction of the adult mosquitoes. If the disinfection
mentioned includes elimination of water catchments in which this
mosquito breeds, better long-term control will be accomplished and
the risk of urban/suburban YF virus transmission would be greatly
reduced. The forest (sylvan) vector, _Haemagogus janthinomys_, would
not be controlled by spraying.
