An Hib [_Haemophilus influenzae_ type b] meningitis outbreak has
killed one Minnesota infant and sickened 4 others, prompting the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to warn parents to
make sure their kids have had their basic Hib vaccinations.

Before a vaccine became available in 1992, some 20 000 U.S. children
under age 5 got severe Hib infections every year, resulting in about
1000 deaths. Minnesota hadn't had a Hib death since 1991. Now the
state is facing its biggest outbreak since 1992 -- and it may not be
just that one state, warns Anne Schuchat, MD, director of the CDC's
National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. "The
situation in Minnesota might be isolated, or it might be the
beginning of a trend in other places," Schuchat said at a news
conference. "We are working hard to determine which of these stories
is the right one."

One of the 5 Minnesota Hib meningitis cases was in a 5-month-old
child too young to have finished its 1st series of Hib shots. Another
case was in a child who got all the shots but who turned out to have
an immune deficiency. The other 3 cases -- including the death --
were in infants whose parents refused to vaccinate them. Parents of 2
children objected to vaccines; the parents of the 3rd child were
waiting to vaccinate until the child was 5 years old.

"We had a death from a child who was unvaccinated. We want to
encourage parents who have delayed or refused vaccination to
reconsider," Kristen Ehresmann, RN, MPH, of the Minnesota Department
of Health, said at the news conference. "Hib vaccine not only
protects your child, but also protects babies who have not completed
their primary series or those who have immune compromise." The CDC is
warning all parents of young children to make sure their kids have
finished their primary Hib vaccination. Parents who aren't sure are
urged to check with their doctors as soon as possible. "Parents who
wondered whether Hib vaccination is really necessary need to know the
disease is still around," Schuchat said. "It is a very dangerous
disease and we have a vaccine that can protect children. The
situation where community protection kept unimmunized kids at low
risk of disease does not appear to be holding."

There has been a Hib vaccine shortage since December 2007, when Merck
shut down its vaccine manufacturing plant because of possible
bacterial contamination. Merck made about half the Hib vaccine used
in the U.S. It won't have new vaccine at least until this summer [of
2009]. Sanofi's Hib vaccine is still available, and there should be
enough to cover the basic 3-shot series for infants as well as
catch-up shots for latecomers. Unlike the 2-shot Merck vaccine, the
3-dose Sanofi vaccine is given at 2, 4, and 6 months [of age].
There's supposed to be a booster shot at 12-18 months for either
vaccine, but the CDC has asked parents to hold off on that shot until
the shortage is over (unless their child is at high risk of Hib
illness). Children who have not had their Hib shots and who are at
least 1 year old need only one Hib shot, Schuchat says.

Why is there a Hib outbreak now? Minnesota data suggest that the Hib
vaccine shortage is playing a role. A quick study shows that 18
percent of 7-month-old Minnesota kids who got other vaccines did not
complete their primary Hib vaccination. "We interpret this as a
shortage of vaccine. Providers did not have the vaccine in their
offices," Minnesota state epidemiologist Ruth Lynfield, MD, said at
the news conference. That has probably created a pool of children
vulnerable to Hib infections. Before the shortage, widespread Hib
vaccination kept infection rates low enough to protect even
unvaccinated kids -- a phenomenon called "herd immunity." But now
that protection has ebbed below the level needed to maintain herd
immunity, unvaccinated kids pose a threat to kids whose age or immune
status make them extremely vulnerable to serious Hib complications.

[The above news release was prompted by a CDC MMWR (23 Jan 2009 / 58
(Early Release); 1-3) titled "Invasive _Haemophilus influenzae_ Type
B Disease in Five Young Children --- Minnesota, 2008" that is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58e0123a1.htm?s_cid=mm58e0123a1_e>.


_H. influenzae_ is a small, at times pleomorphic, gram-negative
bacillus that requires blood-derived factors for in vitro growth.
Strains of _H. influenzae_ may be either encapsulated or
non-encapsulated. There are 6 antigenically distinct capsular
polysaccharide types, designated a-f. Type b strains are important
invasive pathogens in non-immune humans, primarily in children aged
less than 2 years, particularly in infants, causing, for example,
meningitis, bacteremia, epiglottitis, facial cellulitis, pneumonia,
empyema, and septic arthritis.

The Hib vaccines currently licensed for use in infants consist of
polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) (the capsular polysaccharide of
Hib) conjugated to a protein carrier. Before the introduction of
conjugate _H. influenzae_ type b vaccination in the USA, this
organism was the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in
children in this country. A dramatic decrease in incidence of
invasive infections due to _H. influenzae_ type b has occurred
following widespread use of conjugate _H. influenzae_ type b vaccines
in infants and children since 1987.

The follow is extracted from the WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record
(2006, 81, 445-452), available at:
<http://www.who.int/immunization/REH_47_8_pages.pdf>.

The 1st dose may be given to infants as young as 6 weeks of age, and
the 2nd and 3rd doses may be given at 4-8 week intervals. In many
industrialized countries, administering a booster dose during the
child's 2nd year of life has provided additional benefit. If given,
the booster dose should be administered to children aged between 12
months and 18 months. For children aged more than 12 months who have
not received their primary immunization series, a single dose of the
vaccine is sufficient. The vaccine is not generally offered to
children aged more than 24 months owing to the limited burden of Hib
disease among children older than that age.

Some older children or adults with special health conditions, such as
sickle cell disease, HIV/AIDS, removal of the spleen, bone marrow
transplant, or cancer treatment with drugs, should also be vaccinated.

The CDC
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58e0123a1.htm?s_cid=mm58e0123a1_e>)
says that "the current Hib vaccine supply in the United States is
sufficient to ensure completion of the primary series for all
children, but not yet to resume the booster dose. Regardless of brand
or product used, full vaccination with the primary series of Hib
vaccine by age 7 months is critical to protect children from disease.
Providers who have questions regarding Hib vaccine supply needed to
complete the primary vaccine series should contact their state health
departments. Combination products may be used for any or all doses of
the Hib primary series. Further, if combination vaccines are the only
vaccines available to providers, a combination product should be used
to complete the primary Hib series, even when this results in receipt
of additional doses of another antigen."
