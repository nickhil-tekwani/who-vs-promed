Unpublished research commissioned by the [UK Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food from Aberdeen University suggests that 100% of chickens
that pass through [British mechanised slaughter houses leave infected with
campylobacter.
The ministry study was conducted by Professor Hugh Pennington, the
microbiologist appointed by the government to investigate the _E. coli_
outbreak which killed 20 people in Lanarkshire and central Scotland in 1996.
It suggests that British slaughter houses are spreading campylobacter much
more widely than previously suspected, infecting birds that may have entered
the system clean from uninfected flocks. "There is a lot of campylobacter
out there and it is getting through and being spread by the processing
system," said Pennington last week. "Not all birds are contaminated when
they go in, but in our study all were contaminated when they came out."
In 1989, 32,000 campylobacter poisoning incidents were reported to the
Public Health Laboratory Service. Last year there were more than 50,000.
The true figure is probably 10 times that, or 500,000 campylobacter
poisonings a year, according to experts. "Most cases are simply not
reported," said Pennington.
The British poultry industry denies that 100% of birds are infected during
the slaughter process, as the Aberdeen study - which tracked chickens in
batches over a 10-month period last year - concluded. But it does concede
that some birds can be infected. Peter Bradnock, chief executive of the
British Poultry Meat Federation, said: "We would not disagree with what they
are saying in the main. Campylobacter is a serious problem on farms and it
is not surprising that cross-contamination is occurring in processing
plants. It is an issue the industry is addressing.
"We might dispute the 100% infection figure for birds leaving these plants,
but certainly the infection rate could be between 40% and 90%."
There are no up-to-date British statistics for the proportion of chickens
infected by campylobacter by the time they reach supermarket shelves, but
freezing does not eradicate the bug. Past studies suggest that about 40% of
ready-to-cook birds are contaminated. Last year the British ate 1.13m tonnes
of chicken, the equivalent of about 13 birds each. The Â£1.6 billion market
has grown by more than 60% since 1985 on the back of red meat health scares
and the trend towards a leaner diet.
A recent survey published by Consumer Reports, the American version of
Which? magazine, found campylobacter in 63% of 1,000 fresh chickens bought
from grocery stores in 36 American cities. Salmonella was found in 16%, and
8% were infected with both. The magazine concluded that no brand of meat was
cleaner than any other. As a group, "premium" chickens - including
free-range birds - were found to be most contaminated.
