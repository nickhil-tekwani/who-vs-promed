The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has confirmed a 2nd case in its latest Ebola outbreak in Equateur province, a close contact of the index patient. The newest patient has also died from her infection.

On Twitter, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said the 25-year-old woman started experiencing symptoms 12 days before she died. She was the sister-in-law of the index patient and was considered one of the man's high-risk contacts. Health officials are tracing the contacts of both patients, and so far, 145 have been identified and are under monitoring.

The outbreak, the DRC's 14th, and 3rd since 2018 in Equateur province, is centered near Mbandaka. Genetic analysis suggests the outbreak is the result of a new spillover from an animal reservoir.

"... the [index case] is a student in Tshuapa Province who returned to Mbandaka on 25 Feb 2022. He was vaccinated against Ebola in 2020 and isn't known to be an Ebola survivor.

Scientists also said he was hospitalized in Mbandaka for 3 days before he was transferred to the Ebola treatment center at the city's Wangata General Reference Hospital."]

Further investigation is needed to determine how a 31-year-old student became infected with Ebola virus through a spillover event. But since he apparently had not been previously infected, it adds weight to genetic analysis suggesting the spillover hypothesis. The 2nd case is the sister-in-law of the index patient, a close contact and high risk individual who sadly also died on 25 Apr 2022.

"The woman began experiencing symptoms on 13 Apr 2022, Braka said, adding that "responders have been working intensely to find anyone who may have interacted with her while she was symptomatic and are closely monitoring their health."

"She was given a "safe and dignified burial," Braka added."

"The initial patient began experiencing symptoms on 5 Apr 2022 and sought treatment at a local health facility before being admitted to an Ebola treatment center on 21 Apr 2022 for intensive care, the WHO said at the weekend. He died later that day, the organization confirmed." (https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/africa/second-ebola-death-drc-intl/index.html)
