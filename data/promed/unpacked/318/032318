Dengue, case fatality rate today's post, not yet archived

From: John Woodall <WOODALL@SERVER.BIOQMED.UFRJ.BR>

In connection with recent queries on dengue/DHF fatality statistics and the
meaning of serological results, we [CHC asked Ken Lam for his experience
in Malaysia.
CHC: In my limited experience (Puerto Rico, 1969), the apparent:inapparent
infection rate was 50%. I am not in the least confident that this would be
the same elsewhere. Some people [notably at CDC, think essentially
everyone who gets infected becomes ill. What is your Malaysian experience?
KL: We do not have good data to answer this question although personally I
do not think infection equals disease. Certainly in endemic countries such
as Malaysia, there must be many cases where silent secondary infections
take place. Whether this is also happening in primary infection is anyone's
guess, although I am more inclined to your view that not all infection
results in disease manifestation.
CHC: I have been asked about the appearance of IgM antibody in dengue
infections. In my experience, essentially everyone with dengue has IgM
antibody on day 0 (day of onset) but others tell me it doesn't appear until
4-5 days after onset. Hard to believe, given the length of the incubation
period. Your experience?
[IgM antibody typically appears early in the course of an infection, before
IgG antibody, and often disappears early also, whereas IgG persists. Thus
IgM is used as an indicator of recent infection. - Mod.JW
KL: We have monitored dengue IgM in both primary and secondary infections
(As. Pac. J. Mol. Biol. Biotechnol. 3: 351-355 1995).
In primary infection, only 7.7% of acute serum samples have dengue IgM,
increasing to 51.2% by days 5-6 and 84.4% by days 7-8.
In secondary infection, IgM appeared earlier with 33.3% having dengue IgM
in the first 2 days, increasing rapidly to 50.4% by the third and fourth
day, 74% by days 5-6 and 93.5% by days 7-8.
We seldom detect dengue IgM on the first day of illness in [either primary
[or secondary infections based on ELISA. [ELISA is a serological test -

[Just to confuse the picture, in my own limited experience (Puerto Rico,
1975-80), we were only able to confirm serologically 33% of clinical dengue
cases, rising to 50% during epidemics. Part of this was attributed to our
inability to obtain appropriate serum specimens, and part to the fact that
the dengue season was the same as the influenza season - Mod.JW
