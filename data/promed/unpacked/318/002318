A case of African swine fever (ASF) has been reported in a wild boar in the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern [Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania].

The case was recorded by the ministry of agriculture for the neighbouring state of Brandenburg, reported Reuters.

It's not the 1st case reported in the region. In mid-November [2021], Germany's federal agriculture ministry confirmed a case on a farm in the same state.

So far, most of the cases occurred in the eastern states of Brandenburg and Saxony.

[African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating hemorrhagic fever of pigs with extremely high mortality rates. In affected countries, it causes huge economic losses. It is transmitted by soft ticks in the genus _Ornithodoros_.

The importance of wildlife reservoirs for disease maintenance has been clearly demonstrated. In Eastern Europe, the disease spread into the local wild boar populations. Further westward or eastward spread could adversely affect the pig sector in many countries. - Mod.PMB
