& Susan Squires, (Public Health Agency of Canada) & the Ontario Ministry
of Health and Long Term Care

By way of further follow-up to the 3 Oct 2005 posting entitled "Undiagnosed
respiratory deaths - Canada (ON): RFI", I am providing the following summary
from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care and the Public Health
Agency of Canada.
The province of Ontario has in place ongoing surveillance for febrile
respiratory illnesses in hospitals and residential institutions. The syndrome
under surveillance is referred to as febrile respiratory illness or FRI. As a
result of this ongoing surveillance, outbreaks are regularly detected,
especially during the influenza/respiratory virus season, which we are now
entering in Canada. The 1st outbreak of laboratory-confirmed influenza for
2005-2006 was reported in a long-term care facility (LTCF) elsewhere in the
country last week, and other common respiratory viruses are circulating as
well. (see Canada's weekly FluWatch surveillance report at:
<http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/fluwatch/index.html)>)
The important summary points re: public health significance of this outbreak
are that preliminary laboratory results are negative for key respiratory
pathogens of concern (including influenza viruses, novel influenza viruses,
SARS as well as other common respiratory pathogens); the attack rate and
mortality rate are not out of the expected range for LTCF outbreaks, and
finally the outbreak appears to be waning (no new cases in recent days).
Further laboratory investigations are ongoing.
The current outbreak of FRI was identified in a Toronto nursing home on Tue 27
Sep 2005. A FRI case is defined as a resident, staff member or visitor with
sudden onset of fever with malaise and/or anorexia, with or without runny nose
and congestion or cough.
To date, 67/249 (27 percent) residents and 8/290 (3 percent) staff members
meet the case definition (these numbers are subject to change); 23 (34
percent) resident-cases and 1 (13 percent) staff-case have been hospitalized.
6 (9 percent) case-residents have died. Additionally, 3 visitors have been
identified who meet the case definition; 2 of these have been hospitalized and
investigated.
Cases are rapidly improving upon initiation of antibiotic therapy. Despite
comprehensive preliminary testing for bacterial and viral respiratory
pathogens, no organism has yet been identified. Lung biopsy specimens from
deceased cases are undergoing testing. Several prevention and control
strategies have been implemented, and the outbreak appears to be waning, with
many cases now improving. There have been new cases reported since midnight 2
Oct [2005]. The risk of transmission to the general public would appear to be
minimal.
In terms of the larger picture with respect to the respiratory [illness]
season in Canada, we are likely to see many reports of nursing home and other
institutional outbreaks. As is often the case, a proportion of these outbreaks
will not have any identifiable etiologic agent. Using increasingly
sophisticated molecular testing techniques, laboratory scientists are able to
detect and identify previously unrecognizable viruses, e.g. new coronaviruses
and parvoviruses etc. As a result, appropriate risk assessment is an important
accompaniment to these reports, especially given the current very wide
coverage of respiratory illnesses/outbreaks in the media.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Jeannette Macey for responding to the
request for information with a very good summary of the epidemiologic features
of the outbreak as well as good background on the febrile respiratory illness
surveillance system in place in Canada. Of interest is the rapid response to
empirical use of antibiotics mentioned above. ProMED-mail also received a
comment from Dr. Steve Berger which seems to be food for thought in the face
of apparent response to antibiotic therapy. - Mod.MPP]

Regarding the outbreak of respiratory illness at a facility for senior
citizens in Ontario, legionellosis appears to have been discounted on the
basis of negative urinary antigen tests. Most such tests are designed to
detect only _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1. Additional procedures,
such as culture and serology, should be performed in order to rule out other
strains of Legionella.
