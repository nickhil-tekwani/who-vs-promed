Public health inspectors were called in after cyclists fell ill with food
poisoning after an event in the Welsh countryside. The cyclists tested
positive for the bacterium _Campylobacter jejuni_, usually coming from
uncooked meat and poultry.

But following an investigation by health experts, the muddy mountain cycle
course was found to be heavily contaminated with sheep droppings. The
cyclists are believed to have been affected by eating meals and snacks
during the event without washing their hands first.

A report by the National Public Health Service for Wales (NPHSW) said: "We
were alerted after being told 8 of the bikers had become unwell after the
event. At that point, we launched an Internet based questionnaire to
investigate the outbreak."

More than 660 mountain bikers from all over Britain took part in the Builth
Wells Mountain Biking Marathon in Powys in July 2008. A total of 355
responses were received, with 161 cyclists reporting symptoms such as
diarrhea and vomiting.

The report, by the NPHSW, concluded the outbreak was caused by
campylobacter spread to the cyclists by mud which was contaminated with
sheep feces. Heavy overnight rain is likely to have contributed to the
outbreak by increasing the amount of liquid mud on the course.

The report recommended cyclists to eat out of protective wrappers at future
events. It also called for organizers to re-route courses to avoid areas
heavily contaminated with droppings.

[This interesting outbreak once again demonstrates that athletic
competition may not be good for one's health in more ways than just direct
trauma. Other reports of similar events due to other enteric pathogens do
exist, but this stands alone in the proposed mechanism of transmission.

The full report, published in December 2008, can be found at

The strongest association with illness was shown to be accidental ingestion
of mud along the route.
