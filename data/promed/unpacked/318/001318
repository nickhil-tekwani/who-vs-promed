After one student at Syracuse University [New York] contracted the mumps in late August [2017], the virus has since spread to more than 76 cases, with the confirmation that 37 students currently have the virus, causing a health epidemic on Syracuse's campus.

According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mumps is a contagious virus that swells salivary glands.

The most common symptoms of mumps are a fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, and swollen glands. These symptoms lead many to believe that they have a 'common cold' until days later, their cheeks are puffy and salivary glands are swollen, indicating that they have mumps.

Mumps can be easily spread, especially at college institutions such as Syracuse University.

"Any institution is susceptible of viruses even if students are vaccinated," said Julie Murawski, director of the UC [Utica College] Student Health Center. "Mumps are spread through close contact, such as coughing, sneezing, talking, kissing, and sharing items from others."

To become immune to the mumps virus, the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccination is offered and is mandatory for children to receive 2 doses prior to attending kindergarten. A 3rd dosage is not required, but is strongly considered during an outbreak. Syracuse University gave close contacts of those affected a 3rd dose to help them fight off the virus.

With the mumps outbreak happening an hour away from Utica, the UC community was concerned of something similar happening on its campus. Murawski, who has worked at UC since 1999, says there have been no cases of mumps, but UC has had bad cases of chickenpox and the flu in recent years.

"It's very fortunate that there haven't been any mumps cases at UC, but we have had contagious diseases on campus," Murawski said. "We've dealt with international students with chicken pox before and every year we have a couple of students with the flu."

The UC Student Health Center is currently advertising that students stop in to get their flu shot on the daysheet and with flyers on campus, which Murawski says helps motivate students to get vaccinated.

"Flyers, email, and clinics have all helped raise awareness for making sure students get vaccinated," Murawski said. "We also have a receptionist at the front desk that asks students if they would like to receive a flu shot even if they are there for another visit. So far, we have vaccinated over 360 students and if we ever run out of vaccinations, we always order more."

But even if students are vaccinated, they are not completely immune to the virus.

"All vaccinations aren't 100 percent effective," Murawski said. "But, if a student gets sick after getting vaccinated, they experience less severe symptoms. We currently have 2 students with flu-like symptoms: 1 student was vaccinated and is experiencing minor symptoms while the other student wasn't vaccinated and is experiencing milder symptoms and is much sicker than the vaccinated student."

In recent years, there has also been controversy on whether people should be vaccinated or not. UC nursing students shared their thoughts regarding how important it is to be vaccinated.

"I believe all individuals should get vaccinated," senior Michael Wells said. "I do understand that individuals think that vaccines have a direct correlation to developmental disorders such as autism, however there has been extensive research into the connection between vaccinations and autism, none of which have provided substantial evidence backing that claim. Research has concluded that vaccines are safe to be administered to children."

But, Wells also says that there's nothing that administrators and staff can do to make sure everyone gets vaccinated as it's the individual's choice.

"Individuals are given a right to determine if they want to get vaccinated or not," Wells said. "Institutions like UC, however, can give the appropriate education on vaccinations in hopes to avoid an epidemic like the one that is occurring at SU. There is also a debate on whether or not parents should have the right to refuse vaccinations on their children, but that is a completely different debate."

UC currently has a student health portal where students can upload and share their immunization records with UC Admissions prior to coming to college, which the UC Student Health Center can access as well.

Senior Emra Klempic said the UC health portal is very important and helps students in making sure they are up to date on their vaccinations.

"Vaccinations are very safe and effective at preventing illnesses, such as the mumps and the flu, so everyone should get vaccinated and stay up to date," Klempic said. "If a student is missing a vaccination, they will notice that on the UC health portal and it's important that they receive the necessary vaccination as soon as possible, so that it doesn't end up becoming a public issue."

American University [Washington DC] officials say they have been notified of an additional case of mumps by the DC Health Department (DC DOH), bringing the total to 7.

The new suspected case is a student who resides in Leonard Hall and has been isolated.

Of the 7 mumps cases reported, 2 cases now have laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis (5 are classified as probable diagnoses). So far, all affected students have been contacted by DC DOH and were or are being isolated for the recommended five days after their initial symptoms develop.

According to the DOH, "Mumps spreads from person to person via droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person ..." We recommend that people take precautions and avoid kissing, sharing drinks or eating utensils. As with many infectious illnesses, frequent hand washing is also an important way to protect yourself because the virus may also be spread indirectly when a person touches items or surfaces without washing their hands and then someone else touches the same surface and rubs their mouth or nose. The virus typically goes away on its own, however, and patients fully recover.

Syracuse University [see report in [1] above]
---------------------------------------------
In Syracuse, NY, officials with SU Health Services report the number of confirmed and probable mumps cases are 39 and 77, respectively, as of 9 Nov 2017.

A 3rd dose of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), the "outbreak dose" was offered to students all week free of charge.

The Hawaii State Department of Health (DOH) continues to investigate an increasing number of cases of mumps infection statewide.

The disease has been confirmed in children and adults, both vaccinated and unvaccinated. Nearly 60 percent of cases have been in adults aged 18 years and older. There have been 16 reports of complications due to mumps infection (such as, orchitis, hearing loss).

As of 9 Nov 2017, there have been 557 confirmed cases of mumps for 2017, with the distribution of cases as follows:
- Honolulu 450
- Hawaii 61
- Kauai 44
- Maui 2

Due to the current mumps outbreak in Hawaii, in addition to the routine vaccination recommendations above, persons born in 1957 or later, especially those who live or work in crowded conditions, should receive an additional MMR vaccine dose now.

Last year [2016], there were more than 6000 cases of the contagious disease mumps reported in the United States -- the highest number in 10 years.

That's according to the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends everyone 15 months and older receive 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, which protects against 3 diseases: measles, mumps and rubella.

There's been a more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases since the pre-vaccine era and in 2010, the total annual cases were down in the hundreds.

But in recent years, there have been multiple mumps outbreaks reported across the country. In fact, the number of reported cases increased from 229 in 2012 to more than 6000 cases in 2016.

The last major outbreaks occurred in 2006, when the US saw more than 6500 reported cases, predominantly in the Midwest and among college-aged students.

Between 1 Jan and 7 Oct 2017, 47 states and the District of Columbia have reported approximately 4667 cases to the CDC.

[The CDC summary of mumps cases in the US from 1 Jan to 4 Nov 2017 (a slightly later date than the report cited above), reports 47 states and the District of Columbia, 4980 people infected.

Since the 2-dose vaccination program was introduced in 1989, mumps cases have ranged year to year from a couple of hundred to several thousand., However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of reported cases, from 229 cases in 2012 to 5833 cases in 2016. The recent increase has been mainly due to multiple mumps outbreaks reported across the country in settings where people often have close contact with one another, like college campuses.

Past mumps outbreaks include 2016-17, when a large outbreak in a close-knit community in northwest Arkansas, resulted in nearly 3000 cases. And in 2015-16, outbreaks were reported from several university campuses, including a number of smaller outbreaks with limited spread. The 2 largest outbreaks were from Iowa and Illinois, each involving several hundred university students; both held wide-scale vaccination campaigns.
