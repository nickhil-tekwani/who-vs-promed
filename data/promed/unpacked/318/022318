Bird flu claims another life in Egypt: the 49th case and 22nd death
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Egypt's health ministry announced the death on Friday [11 Apr 2008]
of a 30-year-old woman from the H5N1 strain of bird flu. It is the
22nd human death from bird flu among 49 cases in the country since
the disease was first discovered [there] in 2006, a ministry official
told the MENA news agency.

[The woman] first showed signs of infection on 2 Apr 2008 and was
taken on 9 Apr 2008 to a Cairo hospital, where she died, MENA
reported. This case was Egypt's 2nd death from the disease in a week.
On Saturday [5 Apr 2008], a 19-year-old boy from the Nile Delta
province of Beheira, died in hospital after being unsuccessfully
treated with Tamiflu.

In January [2008], 4 people died of the disease in just one week,
after safety precautions had been relaxed in the belief that the
virus had disappeared when no case had been reported for 6 months.

Egypt's location on major bird migration routes and the widespread
practice of keeping domestic fowl near living quarters have led to it
being the hardest-hit country outside Asia. Despite a government ban
on raising poultry on rooftops -- an age-old tradition in Egypt --
chicken, ducks, and geese continue to exist on many rooftops,
alongside a multitude of pigeon coops. The government says it is
conducting a vigorous campaign to combat the spread of the virus
through vaccinations and raising awareness, but experts and officials
have warned against people dropping their guard.

Earlier this year [2008], health minister Hatem al-Gabali warned
against slackness in the preventative measures taken to fight bird
flu. Health ministry spokesman Abdel Rahman Shahin has repeatedly
urged the public to remain vigilant and deplored the relaxation of
precautions. Officials have also warned sick people that failure to
report they have been in contact with contaminated domestic fowl
makes it more difficult to detect the virus and to treat it. Many of
those infected are fearful of revealing their symptoms as they would
lose a source of revenue and they fear the anger of their neighbours
throughout the village who may have their flocks slaughtered. As a
result, many sufferers are often hospitalised too late for medical
treatment to work. Women and children have borne the brunt of the
virus because of their role in taking care of domestic fowl.

A national campaign to slaughter possibly infected birds is more
often than not seen as a threat from authorities in which people have
no faith. The authorities recommend eating factory-farmed chicken
whose origins can be traced. Almost 2 years since H5N1 appeared in
Egypt, the country has become one of the most affected in the world.
The WHO (World Health Organisation) said earlier this year [2008]
that countries around the world had improved their defences against
bird flu, but the situation remained critical in Egypt and Indonesia
where the risk of the H5N1 virus mutating into a major human threat
remains high.
