Update: Investigation of Bioterrorism-Related Anthrax -- Connecticut
---------------------------------------
CDC and state and local health departments continue investigating cases of
bioterrorism-related anthrax. This report revises the number of suspected
cases and updates the investigation of a 94-year-old Connecticut (CT)
resident who died from inhalational anthrax.

As of 5 Dec 2001, a total of 22 cases of anthrax have been identified; 11
were confirmed as inhalational anthrax, and 11 (7 confirmed and 4
suspected) were cutaneous. A 54-year-old man who lived in Delaware and who
worked at a postal facility in New Jersey (NJ) previously had been
classified as having a suspected case of cutaneous anthrax. Additional
laboratory findings indicate that the patient's illness no longer meets the
CDC surveillance case definition for anthrax (1). Initially, he was
classified as having a suspected case because of a lesion on his left hand
and elevated levels of antibody (IgG) to the protective antigen component
of anthrax toxin. Subsequent biopsies of the skin lesion did not reveal
_Bacillus anthracis_ in the tissue, and additional confirmatory antibody
tests on serum specimens were negative.

The investigation in CT has not identified any additional cases of anthrax
through prospective and retrospective surveillance. For prospective
surveillance, hospitals, clinicians, postal facilities, and the state
medical examiner have been asked to report daily any persons with clinical
findings that might be related to anthrax, including sepsis and pneumonia.
To date, 50 such patients have been reported. No evidence of anthrax was
found in 43 patients and the remaining 7 are being evaluated; preliminary
investigations of the 7 patients have not identified evidence of anthrax.
Retrospective surveillance has included a review of all deaths since 1 Sep
2001 involving residents of Oxford and 8 surrounding towns (Beacon Falls,
Naugatuck, Ansonia, Derby, Woodbury, Shelton, Seymour, and Southbury [total
population: 152 481); 487 death certificates for persons who died during
September--November 2001 have been reviewed. Of the 131 deaths attributed
to sepsis, pneumonia, sudden death, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, or
undetermined cause, 66 occurred in hospitals. Of these, 52 had no apparent
anthrax disease. For 14 persons who died soon after arrival to the
hospital, review of hospital records revealed no evidence of anthrax, but
information in the hospital record was insufficient to determine the
specific cause of death, and postmortem examinations were not conducted.

The source of exposure for the case of inhalational anthrax in a
94-year-old woman who lived in Oxford, CT, remains unknown. Multiple
environmental samples collected from all places (e.g., the patient's home,
church, voting place, restaurants, and cars in which she traveled) the
patient was known to have visited during the 60 days preceding illness
onset were negative for _B. anthracis_ by culture. Nasal swab specimens
were negative from 16 persons epidemiologically linked to the case (e.g.,
persons who worked in the home and assisted with shopping).

Environmental sampling was performed at the postal processing and
distribution center in Wallingford, CT, that serves the towns of Oxford and
Seymour and identified _B. anthracis_ spores in 3 high-speed mail sorters.

This facility receives mail from several postal distribution facilities
known to have been contaminated by _B. anthracis_ spores, including the
postal center in Hamilton, NJ, which was the origination site for envelopes
containing _B. anthracis_ powder that were addressed to 2 U.S. senators.

To evaluate potential cross-contamination of envelopes (i.e., an envelope
contaminated from another _B. anthracis_-contaminated envelope or
environmental surface), postal sorting records from the Wallingford
facility are being examined to determine the timing and pathways of mail
delivered to the CT patient and her local relatives and contacts. Sorting
records in Hamilton indicated that an envelope addressed to a postal code
adjacent to Oxford had been processed using the same automatic canceling
machine at Hamilton <1 minute after one of the 2 _B. anthracis_
powder-containing letters sent to a U.S. senator. This envelope was
subsequently sorted at Wallingford and delivered to Seymour. The envelope
was received at a residence 4 miles from the home of the CT patient; this
envelope was recovered from the recipient and _B. anthracis_ spores were
detected on the outside of the envelope; none of the members of this
household had clinical evidence of anthrax. No record of mail to the CT
case-patient processed at Hamilton was found, and no _B. anthracis_ spores
have been recovered from envelopes found at her home.

Reported by: N Lustig, et al.

Editorial Note:
As of 5 Dec 2001, a total of 11 inhalational anthrax cases have been
identified; direct exposure to a _B. anthracis_-containing envelope was
likely in the first 9 cases (2). The source of exposure to _B. anthracis_
for the inhalational anthrax cases in CT and New York City (NYC) remain
under investigation by public health and law enforcement officials. No
direct exposure to _B. anthracis_-containing envelopes has been identified
for these cases. Similar to the first 9 cases of inhalational anthrax,
exposure to _B. anthracis_ might have occurred through the mail from
exposure to an envelope containing _B. anthracis_ powder. No direct
exposure to envelopes containing _B. anthracis_ powder has been identified
for the inhalational cases in CT and NYC. In the absence of definitive
evidence indicating how transmission occurred, infection from a
cross-contaminated envelope is one hypothesis being considered by
investigators.

Cross-contamination could explain how _B. anthracis_ spores were spread to
some postal facilities that did not process the envelopes addressed to the
U.S. senators. Approximately 85 million pieces of mail were processed on
the days after the implicated envelopes passed through the NJ and the
District of Columbia (DC) sorting facilities until they were closed. Both
of these facilities had evidence of widespread environmental contamination
with _B. anthracis_. Some of the pieces of mail that passed through these
facilities could have been cross-contaminated and, in turn, could have
contaminated mail processing equipment or other envelopes processed
elsewhere. Despite the high volume of mail distributed to metropolitan
areas around these facilities, active surveillance has not identified cases
of inhalational anthrax among approximately 10.5 million residents in NJ,
DC, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia or in postal workers since the
initial cluster of cases associated with the processing of the implicated
letters sent to the U.S. senators. The large population, the duration of
active surveillance, and the absence of additional cases of inhalational
anthrax indicate that if there is a risk for inhalational anthrax
associated with exposure to mail cross-contaminated by the letters
addressed to the U.S. senators, it is very low.

Despite this very low risk, persons remaining concerned about their risk
may want to take additional steps such as not opening suspicious mail;
keeping mail away from your face when you open it, and not blowing or
sniffing mail or mail contents; washing your hands after you handle the
mail; avoiding vigorous handling of mail, such as tearing or shredding mail
before disposal; and discarding envelopes after opening mail. However, the
effectiveness of these steps in reducing any residual risk is not known.

Suspicious persons or situations should be reported to law enforcement
authorities. Health-care providers should remain alert for persons with
clinical presentations consistent with early anthrax (3), obtain
appropriate diagnostic tests (e.g., blood cultures and chest radiograph)
(4), and report suspicious illnesses to local or state public health
authorities. Fatalities can be minimized by promptly initiating combination
antimicrobial therapy (5). Recommendations for risk reduction for persons
with potential occupational exposure are available (6). Public health
surveillance for anthrax and research efforts to further define the risk
associated with exposure to _B. anthracis_ in the environment as a result
of the bioterrorist attack is ongoing. CDC will continue to provide updates
as new information becomes available.

A letter addressed to Senator Patrick Leahy found in the sequestered
Congressional mail on 16 Nov 2001, has been opened by experts at the Army's
Ft. Detrick, Maryland, biomedical research laboratory.

The envelope contained a quantity of a substance believed to be anthrax,
based on testing conducted before the envelope was opened, and appears to
be consistent with that found in the letter sent to Senator Daschle. While
the 2 letters appear to be virtually identical, science will continue to
drive this analysis and investigation.

The envelope and letter will be decontaminated and a number of
sophisticated scientific and forensic examinations have been initiated.
Investigators are hopeful that the results of those tests -- expected in
the coming days and weeks -- will yield clues that will bring us closer to
identifying who is responsible for the anthrax attacks.

Since the letter was found on 16 Nov 2001, experts from the scientific,
public health, and law enforcement communities have worked closely and with
caution to develop protocols and procedures to preserve evidence. The goal
is to give investigators as much as possible to work with.

Investigators are emphasizing the importance of keeping the American public
focused on the investigation. The information known so far, together with
what is hoped to be learned from the Leahy letter, will likely give
investigators new leads and the American public additional information to
consider in the event that someone out there may know something. The FBI
reminded the public that the reward is up to $1.25 million, and anyone who
thinks they may know something should contact their local FBI office or
police department.
