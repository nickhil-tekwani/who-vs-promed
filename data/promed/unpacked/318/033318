The authorities of the Ministry of Health in Azuero [peninsula] confirmed the report of a new case of a hantavirus [infection]. They indicated that the patient, a 32-year-old male, is currently in the intensive care unit of the Dr. Joaquin Pablo Franco Hospital.

Hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome] is an acute virus disease caused by hanta[viruses]. Field mice (mainly long-tailed ones) [the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_)], transmit it to people, shedding the virus in saliva, feces and urine.

Transmission occurs:
- Through inhalation, and is the most frequent cause [of infection]. This occurs when one breathes in open or closed (sheds, gardens, pastures) places where the feces or urine of infected rodents shed the virus, contaminating the environment.
- By direct contact by touching live or dead rodents or their feces or urine.
- By bites by infected rodents.

The Los Santos Regional Health Directorate, in a press conference, stated on Monday [24 Nov 2014] that there is another case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the province, a 22-year-old patient from Tonosi, increasing the number of cases [in the province] to 67 so far this year [2014], with 30 cases of hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome] and 37 cases of hantavirus fever.

The grain harvest season is coming, and the [health] authorities request the populace take measures necessary to avoid the increase of hantavirus cases in the province, mainly in Tonosi, which has 80 per cent [of provincial cases] this year [2014]. [The concern about grain harvest and storage is the attraction that it provides as a food source for rodents that carry the virus. - Mod.TY]

[These cases have all occurred in the same general area, in the Azuero peninsula region.

Although not specified in the report above, or in the previous ones, the hantavirus most likely involved is Choclo virus, since it is the only hantavirus known to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome with hospitalizations in Panama. The number of reported cases of Choclo virus infection in Los Santos province continues to increase, from 60 cases on 9 Oct 2014 to the 67 reported above. The Azuero region is endemic for Choclo virus, and several cases this year (2014) and in the past have come from there. The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
