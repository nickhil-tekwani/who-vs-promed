Abstract
Background: For the 1st time, an outbreak of chikungunya [virus infections] has been reported in the Americas. Locally acquired infections have been confirmed in 14 Caribbean countries and dependent territories, Guyana and French Guiana, in which a large number of North American travelers vacation. Should some travelers become infected with chikungunya virus, they could potentially introduce it into the United States, where there are competent _Aedes_ mosquito vectors, with the possibility of local transmission.

Discussion
At a time when locally acquired cases of dengue (also transmitted by _Aedes aeygpti_ and _A. albopictus_ mosquitoes) have recently been reported in southern regions of the United States, our findings highlight the risk for introduction and potential autochthonous transmission of chikungunya virus in selected areas of the country. The effectiveness and efficiency of interventions to mitigate these risks could be optimized through a combination of public education, early detection by medical providers, and the strategic use of public health resources in areas of greatest risk.

[The 23 Jun 2014 edition of Sinembargo (http://www.sinembargo.mx/23-06-2014/1035055 in Spanish) stated that there are 1200 cases of chikungunya virus infection in El Salvador. There have been 19 public and private schools closed because most cases have occurred among students. This report indicated that blood samples were sent to the USA CDC for further confirmation. Results are expected from CDC within 2 weeks. If these are locally acquired infections, as seems likely, it is an indication that virus transmission is occurring in El Salvador, and the virus can be expected to extend throughout Central America and into Mexico.

A report predicts that "considering the worldwide dissemination of _Aedes_ mosquitoes, several years ago, some of us anticipated the globalization of chikungunya [virus] through invasion of the Americas and alerted that the question was not if it can happen but when it will happen. Arboviruses present an ongoing challenge to medicine and public health."
