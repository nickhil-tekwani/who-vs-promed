Taipingzen and Wangjiaxiang areas, both within the city boundary of
Wanyuan, Sichuan province, had a suspected outbreak of foot and mouth
disease (FMD). More than 200 pigs were destroyed by burning. The
authorities tried to suppress the news, but the rumors spread.

Dajiyuan News discovered that the outbreak was first heard of in
Wanjiaxiang on 20 Apr 2005. The signs include blisters, ulcers, and
pustules around the snouts of the pigs. Later, similar signs were found in
cattle.

Now no one dares to buy pork or beef. The municipal government set up a
disease control station. The bureau of farm animals convened several
closed-door meetings and decided to destroy more than 200 pigs and more
than 10 cattle and strictly blocked the news from the public.

People suspected it might be avian influenza and hoped for the World Health
Organization (WHO) to send a team of experts for an investigation.

The Dajiyuan News reporter had a telephone interview with 14 to 15 local
residents. Except 3 or 4 who had no idea about the matter, the majority of
the interviewees knew the story from hearsay.

The more precise date for the initial outbreak was 15 Apr 2005. The
epidemic then spread further between 15 and 20 Apr 2005 to involve Taiping,
Wanjiaxiang, Hualoufen, Chinhuazen, and Tchanfenxiang. As soon as people
heard about the epidemic, they dared not buy pork and switched to buying
chickens, ducks, and fish. The pork business has been affected gravely.
Some people found out from meat vendors that the affected pigs showed
blisters, ulcers, and pustulations. As to the cattle FMD, the signs were
less serious. People felt that the loss due to the epidemic was somewhat
serious in Wanyuan city.

It was said that in May and June 2004 a similar outbreak had occurred. That
[outbreak] lasted for about a month and resulted in destruction of 100 to
200 pigs. The disease control and prevention departments examined the case
and issued a formal public notification, saying no SARS or other suspicious
viruses were involved. Since then, people felt relieved and started to eat
pork again.

The government has not yet formally explained the current issue to the
public. For this reason, rumors are running wild among local residents.

Some say that pigs can contract FMD, referred to as "Number 5 Disease". It
not only acutely infects cattle, goats, sheep, and pigs -- resulting in
great losses to the pork industry -- but also is an epizootic disease,
meaning that humans are susceptible [this is incorrect; see moderator note
below - Mod.RY].

People who are used to eating pork have stopped. Some say that the color of
the pork is not right. Everyone hopes for clarification from the
authorities. Until then, people do not want to take the risk.

[Humans are not susceptible to foot and mouth disease, which is caused by a
virus in the Picornaviridae family. Hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD), a
human disease, is often confused with the animal disease. But HFND is most
often caused by coxsackievirus A16 and less frequently by enterovirus 71 or
other enteroviruses. The enterovirus group also includes polioviruses,
coxsackieviruses, and echoviruses. The viruses that cause FMD are not
related to those that cause HFND.

Generally meat from FMD infected animals -- with thorough cooking -- is
considered safe for consumption. But transporting the animal to the
processing plant may spread the disease, which is why most infected animals
are not transported to a processing plant. - Mod.TG]

China investigates talk of foot and mouth disease
-------------------------------------------------
The Chinese government is investigating rumours of an outbreak of the
highly contagious foot and mouth disease (FMD), an official from the
Agriculture Ministry said on Tuesday. Asked about talk in the grain trade
of an outbreak, the official in Beijing told Reuters that no cases had been
confirmed so far. "We are still investigating," he said without
elaborating. Traders in the soy market reported strong rumours that the
disease had spread in several provinces, but no further details were
available.

The Chinese government has not previously announced any outbreak of FMD,
which causes severe weight loss in cloven-hoofed animals like cattle and
hogs. But a Chinese government source said there was an outbreak of FMD
almost every year and that the government was currently working on a
reporting system. It had also advised the quarantine authorities to tighten
controls over exports after Hong Kong found FMD in beef from China, the
source said.

The animal health body Office International des Epizooties (OIE) lists
China as a country free of FMD, with vaccination. In 2001 an outbreak of
the disease in Britain devastated farming communities and was brought under
control only at a cost of an estimated GBP 8 billion (USD 15 billion).

[Though it is true that animals can survive FMD, production drops
dramatically. The animals are in pain and do not want to walk or eat.
Consequently they lose weight, milk production drops, and of course feed
consumption decreases. The blisters and vesicles in the mouth and on the
hooves are quite painful. The infection can be transmitted on straw, feed
commodities, and on carcasses, and other animal products such as hides. We
look forward to hearing confirmation or exclusion of the diagnosis and
further information about the surveillance system proposed. - Mod.TG]
