Cholistan desert: UVAS scientists diagnose mysterious camel disease
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (UVAS) scientists
have diagnosed the mysterious disease, which has caused death of 4000
camels in Cholistan desert. According to the UVAS scientists the
disease was identified and diagnosed at University Diagnostic Lab
(UDL) of University of Veterinary & Animal Sciences, Lahore. People
of Cholistan were worried due to the deaths of camels.

Director, UDL, Professor Dr Masood Rabbani, said that Cholistani
camels were suffering from respiratory distress due to _Pasteurella
multocida_. This diagnosis will be very helpful in controlling the
problem in Cholistan, he added. This diagnosis was made on the recent
request by the L&DD, Department Government of the Punjab.

Various tests were conducted on provided samples (Trachea, Heart,
Lungs, Liver, Spleen, Kidneys, Intestines, etc) in the lab for
isolation and identification of suspected bacterial and viral
pathogens. After an effort of 8 days, a bacteria _Pasteurella
multocida_ was confirmed.

Normally, this type and quantum of problem has never been reported in
the camels of Pakistan in the past. This probably happened due to
extraordinary cold and humid weather present during those days in the
Cholistan, which helped this organism to cause serious disease in the
camels. Although such problem have already been reported in the
camels internationally.

UDL is now working on the detection of a possible genetic variation
in the said organism. However, the lab has recommended suitable
antibiotics, which are very effective against this organism and if
injected in the affected camels would alleviate the disease.
Vaccinating these camels against Haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) is
must for future control of this disease.

It is pertinent to mention that these camels were not routinely
vaccinated against HS disease because of non-prevalence of the
disease in camels in this part of the world. UVAS Vice Chancellor,
Professor Dr Muhammad Nawaz, lauded the efforts of UDL administration
and staff. He said that UVAS would continue its contribution not only
in education of youth but also in the improvement and progress of
livestock sector of Pakistan.

[Haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) is a major disease of cattle and
buffaloes characterised by an acute, highly fatal septicaemia with
high morbidity and mortality. It is caused by certain serotypes of
_Pasteurella multocida_. Its diagnosis depends on the isolation of
the causative organism, _P. multocida_, from the blood or bone marrow
dead animals by cultural and biological methods, and the
identification of the organism by biochemical, serological and
molecular methods. Has this been done? Details will be helpful.

Pasteurella spp can also be isolated from animals primarily affected
by other agents, especially from lungs. It will be interesting to
note if the involvement of other agents, such as peste des petits
ruminants (PPR), has been excluded in the laboratory (see archived
20110106.0073).

The diagnosis and vaccines of HS are reviewed in detail in chapter
2.4.12. Haemorrhagic Septicaemia of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests
and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, 2010, available online at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.04.12_HS.pdf>.

A useful review of HS is available at
<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/hemorrhagic_septicemia.pdf>.

HS is endemic in Pakistan, affecting cattle and buffaloes. During
2009 (most recent available OIE report), 165 303 cattle and 243 201
buffaloes were vaccinated.

If HS is confirmed in camels, this change in host-range/epidemiology
requires immediate reporting to the OIE. - Mod.AS]
