The Commissioner of Public Health has announced the inclusion of HFM in the
list of compulsorily notified infectious diseases commencing 1 Oct 2000.
The inclusion of HFM had been planned months before and is certainly
timely. In the same interview over Singapore Radio news channels, the
Commissioner revealed that the baseline weekly incidence of HFM disease
among children averaged 26 per week in previous years. This is based on
voluntary notification and active surveillance data. In the last year, the
incidence has increased to 58 per week but could be due largely to
heightened awareness leading to increased reporting.

Outbreak of child virus is growing
Another 24 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease have been reported by 2
more childcare centres
--------------------------------------------------------
2 childcare centres yesterday reported a total of 24 cases of hand, foot
and mouth disease. The reports come in the wake of the death of a
2-year-old child, who may have contracted the disease at a childcare center
in Sengkang.
8 other children from the childcare center, and 5 of their siblings and
cousins, have also been diagnosed with the disease. [2 other centers
reported outbreaks to the Ministry of Community Development and Sports --
which oversees childcare centres. [One reported 19 cases, and [the other
5 cases. Notification is not yet compulsory, but will be from Oct 1 2000.
At a press conference held by the Ministry of the Environment, Ministry of
Health and Ministry of Community Development and Sports, Mr Wang Nan Chee,
Commissioner of Public Health, said making the disease notifiable would
allow Singapore to find out what the norm was for the number of people with
the disease.
The highly-contagious viral infection results in mild illness for between a
week to 10 days. It affects mainly children under 10. This year there has
been an average of 58 cases reported a week -- more than twice the number
of cases reported last year. Health authorities feel the increase could be
due to greater awareness rather than more cases. Mr Wang said the Ministry
of Community Development and Sports held a seminar earlier this year for
people working in childcare centres, which highlighted contagious diseases.
Hand, foot and mouth disease -- in rare cases -- can lead to damage of the
brain or heart, and death. There has never been a reported death, or a case
of serious infection resulting from the disease in Singapore. But in 1997,
Malaysia experienced an outbreak which resulted in 50 deaths. And in 1998,
an outbreak in Taiwan killed 78. In both countries, the deaths were largely
among young children. Dr Chew Suok Kai, director of Epidemiology and
Diseases Control at the MOH, said the postmortem of the toddler showed a
high level of virus in the body. Because he had a fever and rashes on his
limbs, his death was likely to be related to hand, foot and mouth disease.
But he said it would take about two weeks to identify the virus in him.
Meanwhile, all hospitals and polyclinics have been alerted to be more
vigilant in identifying and treating the disease.
