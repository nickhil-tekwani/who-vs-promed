Cluster of measles cases in northern Italy: a preliminary report
------------------------------------------------------------
From 19 Sep to 19 Nov 2007, 46 measles cases
related to a single outbreak were reported in the
Piemonte region of northern Italy. The primary
case was an unvaccinated 17-year-old girl who had
visited Cambridge, in the United Kingdom (UK),
between 2-15 Sep 2007 for a study trip, together
with another 54 students from her school. The
group flew from Bergamo to London Stansted
airport and during their stay they also visited
London, Ely and Norwich.

The 17-year-old developed fever 2 days after
returning to Italy (17 Sep 2007), and rash on 19
Sep 2007. Another 2 unvaccinated students in the
group developed rashes on 30 Sep and 1 Oct
respectively. The reporting of the latter case to
the local health authorities prompted an
epidemiological investigation on 2 Oct 2007. The
investigation made it possible to identify which
was the primary and which were the secondary
cases. Urine and serum samples were collected
from the 3 reported cases.

Two siblings of the student who developed a rash
on 1 Oct 2007 were vaccinated against measles on
3 Oct 2007, but both nonetheless developed fever
on 10 Oct 2007, 7 days after vaccination,
indicating that they had already been infected
prior to receiving the vaccine. The siblings --
who had not travelled to the UK -- developed
rashes on 11 and 12 Oct 2007 respectively, 10 and
11 days after onset of rash in their sister.

By 19 Nov 2007, an additional 33 measles cases
had been identified in adolescents and young
adults living in or attending school in the same
city in which the primary case resides. Another 8
measles cases were reported in nearby towns and
found to be epidemiologically linked to the other
cases. The epidemiological link was defined as
contact with a measles case 7-18 days before the
onset of rash. Of these 8 cases, 7 attend a
school in the city of the primary case, and the
8th case is a 5-year-old sibling of one of the
cases.

The median age of the cases was 16 years (5-21
years) with most (96 percent) in the 12-21
year-age group; 43 (93 percent) were unvaccinated
against measles. Two cases aged 16 and 17 years
were hospitalised with pulmonary complications,
while another case developed bilateral keratitis.
[An epidemic curve of the outbreak is presented
as a figure in the original test.] So far, 20 (43
percent) of the 46 reported cases have been
laboratory-confirmed. Measles virus genotyping
results are pending.

Outbreak control measures were immediately
instituted according to national and regional
recommendations. Vaccination against measles was
offered to susceptible contacts in families and
schools and the regional and nearby local health
authorities were informed of the outbreak. In
addition, the local primary care paediatricians
and general practitioners were alerted for prompt
reporting of measles cases to the local health
authorities and further investigation. The
outbreak was notified on the forum site of the EU
vaccine-preventable disease network,
<http://www.euvac.net>, to alert epidemiologists belonging to the network [1].

General comments
------------------------
The travel history of the primary case is highly
suggestive of importation of the measles virus
from the United Kingdom, where there have been
several large outbreaks this year [2,3,4].
Molecular characterisation studies would assist
in establishing further the link. The potential
of measles outbreaks linked to importation of
disease from other countries where measles virus
continues to circulate will continue to exist
unless higher vaccination rates are achieved. In
the catchment areas of the 4 local health
authorities of the Piemonte region in which the
cases occurred, estimates of vaccination coverage
against measles with one vaccine dose for the
1989-1992 birth cohorts are low (70-85 percent),
while in younger age cohorts it is estimated to
be approximately 90-92 percent. A higher index of
suspicion of measles is therefore required in
young adults presenting with a rash in a known
outbreak setting or who have recently travelled
to areas still endemic for measles.
