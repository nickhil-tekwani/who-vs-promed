[The last reported outbreak was in 2001; Kenya also reported
rinderpest in 2000. Prior to that, the last reported outbreak of
rinderpest in Kenya was in 1996. Somalia has not reported the
presence of the disease since 1977 [perhaps not surprising since
it has had no central government for years. - Mod.JW]
The history of rinderpest in Africa is long and significant,
including nearly successful continent-wide eradication programs
including disruptive social and political impacts in 19th-century East
Africa after the introduction of rinderpest into Ethopia. Countries
such as Zimbabwe have not seen the disease since the last
decade of the 19th century. An excellent account is given in Cal
Schwabe's "Veterinary Medicine and Human Health."
Given the explosive nature of rinderpest, any report anywhere in
Africa is disconcerting, although this outbreak seems well
defined, contained, and subject to an ongoing control program. -
