Horses from the farms in Montgomery, Calvery, and St. Mary's counties traveled to a Virginia farm at which horses tested positive for EHV-1.

The Maryland Department of Agriculture has placed 3 facilities in the state under quarantine because horses residing there had traveled in late February 2018 to a Virginia farm at which horses tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported 9 Mar 2018.

"One farm in Montgomery County reported a horse with a fever testing positive on blood only, not on the nasal swabs, on 5 Mar 2018," the EDCC said. "A horse was reported with a fever on a farm in Calvert County on 7 Mar 2018 but tested negative on blood and swabs on 8 Mar 2018. The 3rd farm in St. Mary's County reports all horses remain afebrile. All 3 farms remain under hold orders. No horses have displayed any neurologic signs."

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM (the neurologic form). In many horses, the only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

The Wyoming Livestock Board confirmed a horse in Sheridan County has tested positive for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM). The horse has been quarantined at its premise in Sheridan County with 12 other horses.

The affected horse began showing neurologic signs on Sunday, 11 Mar 2018, while competing at a barrel racing event at the Camplex facility in Gillette. Owners of any horses attending the event should consult with their veterinarians and take precautions regarding exposure risk.

At a minimum, these precautions should include close monitoring of the horses and checking their temperatures at least twice daily.

If any of the horses show neurologic signs or fever, the owner needs to contact his/her veterinarian and the Wyoming Livestock Board.

Although the source of the infection in the quarantined horse is unknown, this horse did compete at the Central Wyoming Fairgrounds in Casper on Thursday, 1 Mar 2018, and at Laramie County Community College, Friday, 2 Mar 2018 - Sunday, 4 Mar 2018.

Horses at the events might have been exposed. Because the incubation period for the disease is less than 14 days, clinical signs should have been apparent in any exposed horses. However potentially exposed horses should be monitored for at least 14 days since any possible exposure at events.

More information on equine herpesvirus can be obtained by contacting the Wyoming Livestock Board Field Office at 307-857-4140 or by going to https://aaep.org/sites/default/files/Documents/DiseaseFactsheetEHV.pdf and https://aaep.org/sites/default/files/Documents/DiseaseFactsheetEHM.pdf.

The New Jersey Department of Agriculture has quarantined a property in Union County after a horse developed the highly infectious equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM). EHM is the often deadly neurological form of equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection. No recent movement had occurred at the index property prior to this case.

The horse has been moved into the isolation barn on the property, and the property has been placed under quarantine. Temperatures are also being taken 2x daily on all quarantined horses. It is the 1st reported case in New Jersey in 2018.

"The Department took swift action to prevent the disease from spreading to other horses by enacting a quarantine, which stops movement of horses in and out of the properties and puts in place preventive measures to contain the virus," said New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture Douglas H. Fisher.

The EHV-1 organism spreads quickly from horse to horse and can cause respiratory problems, especially in young horses, spontaneous abortions in pregnant mares, and the neurologic form of the virus can result in death. The incubation period of EHV-1 is typically 2-10 days. Clinical signs include respiratory disease, fever, nasal discharge, depression, cough, lack of appetite, and/or enlarged lymph nodes. In horses infected with the neurologic strain of EHV-1, clinical signs typically include mild incoordination, hind end weakness/paralysis, loss of bladder and tail function, and loss of sensation to the skin in the hind end.

The virus spreads readily through direct contact with infected materials. While highly infectious, the virus does not persist in the environment for an extended time and is neutralized by hand soap, alcohol-based hand sanitizers and sunlight. The virus does not affect humans and other domestic animals, with the exception of llamas and alpacas.

Concerned owners should consult with their veterinarian prior to taking any action as the clinical signs of infection with the neurological form of EHV-1 (EHM) are common to many other diseases. EHM is a reportable disease in New Jersey. If an owner has a horse exhibiting neurologic signs or suspects equine herpes, they are directed to call their veterinarian immediately.

The NJDA Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory provides testing for the neurologic form of EHV-1. For more information, visit http://www.nj.gov/agriculture/divisions/ah/prog/lab.html, or call 609-406-6999.

[It seems that 2018 will be a busy year for EHV. A vaccine against the neurological form would be a welcome advancement in veterinary medicine. This virus makes horse shows of any kind a bit of a biological risk. Please monitor your horse carefully and take the temperature at least twice a day, noting it in a journal. - Mod.TG
