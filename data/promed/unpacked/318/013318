Diagnosis Seoul virus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in the USA
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Very recently, a human Seoul virus (SEOV) infection, or hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) case, in the USA was reported in Colorado, being initially considered as a non-fatal hantavirus cardio-pulmonary syndrome (HCPS), with mild bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest radiograph, with a high Sin Nombre virus (SNV)-specific IgM titer, but without molecular confirmation by viral sequencing. Nevertheless, the case was reported as being SEOV-induced, since presenting in a farmer with a history of recent rat exposure, since showing (non-specified) positive IgM results in a commercial ELISA format containing both Old and New world hantaviral antigens, principally however since showing a self-remitting 2-weeks clinical course with mild acute kidney injury (AKI), but with nephrotic-range proteinuria on sequential urine samples (Chand et al, 2020).

In this same report, the so-called 1st SEOV-HFRS with RT-PCR confirmation in the USA was cited as having occurred in Maryland 2008 (Woods et al, 2009). In fact, it was the 8th American rat-transmitted HFRS case (Clement et al, 2019a), that is, after 3 serologically confirmed SEOV-HFRS cases already documented in 1994 (Glass et al, 1994), followed much later by 4 reports of single cases (Woods et al, 2009; Nielsen et al, 2010; Roig et al, 2012; Shastri et al, 2019). These USA SEOV-HFRS cases included one lethal case (case 6, Roig et al., 2012), with both renal and fatal pulmonary involvement, confirming the ability of SEOV to cause sometimes clinically severe, and even fatal, human infections in the New World. However, this absence for over 15 years of rat-transmitted HFRS reports in the USA, suggests also a potential problem of insufficient medical awareness of this rodent borne zoonosis since 1994, reinforced by the fact that in the same year, another novel hantaviral American rodent borne zoonosis was described, called hantavirus cardio-pulmonary syndrome (HCPS) (Duchin et al, 1994). Newly discovered American sigmodontine hantaviruses, such as Sin Nombre virus (SNV) and/or Andes virus (ANDV), were said to affect mainly the human lung, whereas Old World hantaviruses, such as arvicolid Puumala virus (PUUV) and murid hantaviruses, such as prototype Hantaan virus (HTNV), SEOV, or Thailand viruses (THAIV) were described since the early 1980s, affecting mainly the human kidney. Consequently and since 1994, in virtually each paper in hantavirus literature, a trans- Atlantic hantavirology dichotomy was repeated, maintaining that HCPS was only prevalent in the New, and HFRS in the Old World (Clement et al, 2014; Clement and Maes, 2015). Basically, this dichotomy was counter-intuitive, since the wild rat [brown rat, [_Rattus norvegicus_], the only globally present hantavirus rodent reservoir, and one of the most important in the East, had been equally present in the New World since centuries, thus constituting a potential source for HFRS in the New World. Commensal rats had been found to be SEOV-infected since the early 1980s in virtually every American city, when looked for (Clement et al, 2019a). Moreover, in American cities like Baltimore, at least 3 ensuing studies confirming the SEOV-seroprevalence of approximately 50%, and up to 57.7%, in urban brown rats, and a residential brown rat population density remaining apparently unchanged during estimations in 1949, 1952 and 2004 (Clement et al, 2019a). Of note, the 3 SEOV-HFRS [human] cases, serologically confirmed in 1994, resulted from a retrospective study of patients, likewise in Baltimore City.

All this was before the 2016-2017 discovery of SEOV-infected pet rats in the USA and Canada, resulting in the detection of 17 SEOV-infected pet rats owners or breeders, 3 of these needing hospitalization. However, they were described as having "no AKI [acute kidney injury]", resulting in a rapid self-remittance and quick discharge (Kerins et al, 2017). No renal data were given, but presumably the serum creatinine levels of these hospitalized cases were still within the normal range. The index case-patients of the infected pet rat problem in the USA were an 18-year-old woman with hematuria, owning a pet rat, and her mother. Both had very mildly elevated creatinine levels, being only 1.27 mg/dL and 1.13 mg/dL respectively (normal 0.60-1.10 mg/dL) (Fill et al, 2017). These American data suggest that SEOV-HFRS can be very mild, and probably even subclinical. The same mild renal involvement was observed in France, where from 2014 to 2016, 3 RT-PCR confirmed SEOV-HFRS cases were found with more hepatic than renal disturbances. One case had even perfectly normal renal function parameters; however, clear thrombocytopenia was initially present in all 4 proven SEOV infections (Reynes et al, 2017). The 1st RT-PCR proven SEOV HFRS case in the Netherlands had a normal renal function (Swanink et al, 2018). In Indonesia, 2 human cases of serologically and RT-PCR proven SEOV infection were described, with strongly elevated liver transaminases ore "transaminitis", however, without any evidence of concomitant renal function impediment (Lie et al, 2018).

In contrast to mostly severe HCPS with case fatality rates running up to 50%, many HFRS forms can present as a diagnostic puzzle, with virtually all internal organs temporarily affected, including the lungs (Clement et al, 2014 and 2015). SEOV-HFRS however is particularly challenging, because hepatic involvement can supersede completely renal involvement, with transaminases increased to 10-20 times the norm (Woods et al, 2009; Nielsen et al, 2010; Lie et al, 2018), versus mild or no "transaminitis" in other HFRS or HCPS forms. A liver biopsy delivers no diagnostic clue, while concomitant AKI can be minimal (Nielsen et al, 2010). Predominant hepatic involvement with fever evokes rather an acute viral hepatitis, which appears to be non-A to E, but with initial proteinuria and thrombocytopenia. This preferential liver targeting was already described in 1989 as a "new hantaviral disease" entity in Singapore, and in different South-eastern Asian countries, where the wild rat was and is known as the most important reservoir for pathogenic hantaviruses (Wong et al, 1989).

It is important to remember that Old World hantavirus infections (including SEOV) have as principal diagnostic signs different degrees of AKI, a renal lesion consisting in fact of 3 +/- concomitant laboratory anomalies: 1) reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), 2) proteinuria, and 3) microhematuria (Clement, 2015). Since these 3 initial renal anomalies are completely asymptomatic, they can easily be missed, particularly in mild cases. Moreover, AKI is too often considered as synonymous to reduced GFR, but in these same mild cases, the "kidney injury" can consist of only very transient proteinuria and/or microhematuria, that is, AKI presenting with normal serum creatinine levels (Clement et al, 2019a & b; Swanink et al, 2018).

Endothelial hyperpermeability is often described as the main mechanism for transient capillary leak (Maes et al, 2004; Vaheri et al, 2013), causing acute symptoms in both HFRS and HCPS. However, in all affected organs, including the kidney, this hyperpermeability involves in fact at least 3 successive layers, all functioning normally as leaking barriers: endothelium (plus its glycocalyx), basement membrane, and epithelium. Concomitant breaching of all these 3 barriers necessitates an intense paracrine crosstalk, of which hitherto little is known, but dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages, activated by hantaviral infection, all play a critical modulatory role. For instance, intense macrophage activation can result in a variant of another immunopathological affection, called hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), marked likewise by transient AKI and massive proteinuria (Clement et al, 2016b & c).

Of note, the renal capillary tuft is covered with a unique epithelial layer, consisting of podocytes, which are equally covered by an "external" glycocalyx. Podocytes are highly specialized cells, which have the "slit diaphragm" as inter-podocyte bridging structure, responsible for most, if not all, renal ultrafiltration, and which is temporarily disturbed in its function ('acute podocyte injury' or API) by the transient pro-inflammatory cytokine storm, typical for human hantaviral infection (Maes et al, 2004). This API results in often-massive glomerular proteinuria and microhematuria (Chand et al, 2020; Clement et al, 2015; Mantula et al, 2017). However, these asymptomatic urinary abnormalities have a life span of mostly only 2 weeks (Clement et al, 2015; Mantula et al, 2019), as described already in 1964 in 32 HFRS cases, probably induced by SEOV, and spread by wild commensal rats in Osaka, Japan (Tamura, 1964). Moreover, this novel concept of API could also explain the hitherto ill-known mechanisms of AKI with proteinuria in other emerging zoonotic infections (Clement et al, 2016b).

Consequently, presumptive diagnosis of a hantaviral infection can be quickly confirmed on admission by demonstrating both thrombocytopenia, plus proteinuria and microhematuria, the latter by simple, but preferentially daily urine dipstick examination. This easily obtained bedside information is valid for both Old and New World hantaviral human infections. In the latter, whenever early proteinuria and microhematuria were eventually examined, they were confirmed indeed, not only in ANDV infections (Lazaro et al, 2000; Peters et al, 2002), but also in SNV (Passaro et al, 2001) and in New York virus infections (Fernando et al, 2019). In the case of Old World hantaviral human infections (HFRS) however, the renal involvement is admittedly more pronounced, often resulting in a bout of nephrotic-range proteinuria, without causing a clinically full-blown nephrotic syndrome, due to the brevity of appearance (Clement 2015). The clinical characteristics of (SEOV) HFRS were recently detailed in Emerg. Inf. Dis. (Clement et al, 2019b), but can be summarized as follows:

Rapid laboratory evaluation on hospital admission of suspected acute hantavirus infection, in order of diagnostic (~ epidemiological) Importance
----------
1.* Proteinuria via dipstick positivity gradings: rare, +, ++, +++, ++++, on admission or during 1st week of admission
2.* Microhematuria via dipstick positivity gradings +, ++, +++, on admission or during 1st week of admission
3. Platelets lower than 120 x 109/L, on admission or during 1st week of admission
4. Serum triglycerides greater than 250 mg/dL
5. Total serum cholesterol lower than 100 mg/dL
6. CRP greater than 50 mg/L
7. LDH greater than 400 U/L
8. Creatinine 1.5 mg/dL or greater
9. WBC greater than 11 x 109/L
10. Serum sodium lower than 130 mmol/L
11. Serum albumin lower than 32 g/L
12. Hematocrit higher than 52%
13. Ferritin greater than 2500 microg/L

Note of caution: Criteria 1 and 2 (with asterisks) are particularly valid for the Old World hantavirus infections, also called "hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome" (HFRS). They are however underdiagnosed and underestimated in the New World hantavirus infections, also called "hantavirus cardio-pulmonary syndrome" (HCPS). A clinical suspicion is easily ("bed-side") confirmed by the "lipid paradox" (criteria 4 + 5) (Clement et al, 2016c), and often also by criterion 6, suggestive for a bacterial, rather than for a viral acute infection. All these 13 criteria are spontaneously self-remitting within 2-3 weeks. Consequently, except for a careful fluid balance (particularly during an anuric episode), no invasive treatment (such as dialysis) or diagnostic procedures (such as renal biopsy ) are mandatory, and nephrotoxic drugs are better avoided, such as antibiotics, and particularly NSAIDs.

A flu-like case with fever higher than 38 deg C [100.4 deg F], myalgiae, and acute G-I symptoms, but without initial and transient proteinuria, microhematuria, and thrombocytopenia is probably NOT a hantaviral infection.

[Given the ubiquity of brown rats across the Americas, the frequency with which Seoul hantavirus (SEOV) has been found in them, and the close proximity of rat populations to where people live and work, it is reasonable to assume that many more human SEOV infections occur than are diagnosed and reported.

Dr Clement provides clinically helpful bedside criteria that may be useful in raising consideration of SEOV infection. He provides an overview of the pathophysiology of the infection and the indicators of the resulting injury. Preliminary diagnosis of SEOV infection then requires follow up laboratory confirmation. RT-PCR is the gold diagnostic standard. If serological diagnosis is to be made, the tests used must be able to differentiate SEOV antibodies from those to Sin Nombre (SNV) or Andes hantaviruses.

Accurate diagnosis is important because it is important for establishing a prognosis, monitoring of the course of the case, and epidemiology of the host-virus relationship. The reservoir host rodent of SNV is _Peromyscus_ mice and, as noted above, the SEOV reservoir is the brown rat. Their habits and population dynamics are different as is the approach to their control. - Mod.TY]
