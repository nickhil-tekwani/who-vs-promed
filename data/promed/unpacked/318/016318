[1] Pakistan (North Waziristan): WPV1 AFP, 7th case

Health authorities on Wednesday [1 Jun 2022] reported another wild polio case from the country's North Waziristan tribal area. Reports in local media said the total number of crippling disease cases increased to 7 with all the cases reported from North Waziristan's Mir Ali tehsil.

The Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) for Polio Eradication in erstwhile FATA confirmed that a 7-month-old girl has now tested positive for the contagious virus.

New cases in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa surfaced in the last 2 weeks despite a nationwide inoculation campaign that has seen polio workers go from door to door to administer drops to minors. Federal Health Minister Abdul Qadir Baloch has likened the situation in the mountainous region to an outbreak, saying the authorities are on war footings against the virus.

Prior to the 1st poliovirus case, which was reported earlier this year in April [2022], the 5th most populous country spent 15 months without detecting a single case of the virus, the longest such period in its history.

- In total, at least 4 multi-country campaigns will be implemented. Round 2 was successfully implemented last week across the country, with almost 3 million children reached, with independent monitoring indicating 94% coverage achieved.
- Lessons learned from the 1st round helped inform preparations for the 2nd campaign, including focusing on further strengthened coordination at all levels, microplanning, training and supervision, social mobilization and increased social mobilization and mass media engagement.

- The Government goal is to respond to both outbreaks rapidly and with high quality with additional Supplementary immunization activities (SIA) covering all country. Both outbreak responses will be considered regional responses and synchronization of activities is being planned.
- Intensified surveillance measures to improve detection of acute flaccid paralysis and poliovirus are being implemented in all 11 provinces with special attention to borders with Malawi and Zimbabwe.
- National and subnational authorities continue to be supported by partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, notably by experts of the African Rapid Response Team and the GPLN.
- Detection of this most recent case underscores the appropriateness of the large-scale, rapid, multi-country emergency outbreak response across south-east Africa, in line with revised international polio outbreak response SOPs. The overriding priority is to continue to implement the subregional emergency response, by continuing to conduct large-scale, rapid and high-quality response campaigns.
- Outbreak response plans are currently being reviewed, to ensure rapid and appropriate response to both strains.
- Vaccine logistics is being coordinated across all levels to ensure appropriate supply.
- The Emergency Operations Centre (MOH and GPEI partners) continues to coordinate response across all levels.

[Note that the 3 reported cases of WPV1-associated AFP in the above report refer to the 4th, 5th and 6th confirmed cases in Pakistan and not the 7th case reported in the above media report (in section [1] of this update). To further confuse readers, however, the final summary number of AFP cases associated with WPV1 infections this year (at the end of section [2] above) correctly cites the total of 8 cases, counting the 7th confirmed case in Pakistan.

While only one country has reported cVDPV2-associated cases in the past week, I highly doubt the circulation of cVDPVs in the more than 8 countries reporting either AFP cases or positive environmental samples in the past month has been interrupted.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen; and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]
