Vaccination rates

[1] Vaccine challenge
Date: Fri 19 Jul 2019
Source: The Washington Post [abridged, edited]
http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/the-vaccine-challenge-isnt-just-about-getting-shots/2019/07/19/8e3f83da-a8b8-11e9-9214-246e594de5d5_story.html


Measles outbreaks are occurring around the world because too many people are shunning vaccination, often because of anti-vaccination messages spread on social media. A group of physicians, public-health experts, and child-health advocates pointed out recently that in 2019, the United States and 34 countries in the World Health Organization European region no longer have sufficient numbers of people who have received 2 doses of the measles vaccine to provide the "herd immunity" necessary for community protection. The immunity usually requires about 95 percent coverage.

New data published this week by the WHO and UNICEF shows that global vaccination rates have flatlined at about 86 percent for 3 doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis and one dose of the measles vaccine. The WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, wrote in the Financial Times that 20 million children worldwide -- more than 1 in 10 -- are not getting the vaccines they need, not because their parents are spooked by social media but because they simply lack access to the vaccines. He pointed out that, for many children, the real culprits are not social media trolls but war, unstable governments, poverty, and weak healthcare systems.

None of these diseases is any longer a strictly medical problem. These are challenges of war, mistrust, and misinformation, and those factors must be fought just as vigorously.

Disabilities due to vaccine-preventable illnesses such as measles, mumps, and rubella -- including blindness, deafness, and permanent brain damage -- are rarely discussed in an increasingly heated national debate over vaccine avoidance, in part because discussion tends to focus on the more dramatic risk of death, in part because it's no longer common to know someone living with the lifelong effects of a serious childhood illness. But the risk of disability remains one of the most important reasons to vaccinate, according to Patsy Stinchfield, senior director of infection prevention and control at Children's Minnesota hospitals and clinics.

"(People) look around, and they don't see polio. They don't see measles. They don't see the disabilities. It's invisible," said Stinchfield, senior director of infection prevention and control at Children's Minnesota hospitals and clinics.

"And the trouble is, it's not only young parents, but young providers who don't know. Those of us who do know need to keep reminding people: We do not want to go back to death and disability from vaccine-preventable diseases."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added Ohio and Alaska to the list of states with confirmed measles cases, bringing the total number of states to 30.

The most recent reported numbers show 1148 individual cases since the start of 2019, which is 25 more than the previous week.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a public health emergency on 9 Apr 2019 requiring mandatory measles-mumps-rubella vaccinations for residents who live in certain northern Brooklyn ZIP codes.

The number of confirmed measles cases in New York City has risen to 623 as of [Mon 15 Jul 2019], but the spread of the disease has slowed down significantly with only one new case since 1 Jul 2019, a clear sign that the city's emergency order and well-funded campaign to promote vaccinations is working.

The number of new cases of the infection has dropped steadily -- from 177 in April, to 93 in May, to 22 in June [2019] to just a single case so far this month. As of 25 Jun 2019, the city had used roughly USD 2 million to fight the outbreak, according to Demetre Daskalakis, deputy commissioner of the city's Department of Health.

"While the latest measles numbers make us cautiously optimistic, the Health Department will continue to monitor the situation and on-going transmission closely," a DOH spokesperson told the Brooklyn Eagle.

"We'll remain vigilant in protecting the health of all New Yorkers and maintain the current enforcement strategy until further notice, as well as a continued focus on education and prevention."

Residents of Wusar community of Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State are worried following an outbreak of measles that have killed dozens of children in 2 months in the area.

Most of the victims are children from 2-3 years old, according to locals in the area.

The villagers told our reporter that they did not know the actual cause of the outbreak that kills their children on daily basis.

Daily Trust gathered that the outbreak, which began in May [2019], led to the death of about 100 children, according to the village head, Alhassan Hamidu.

He said most of the children were buried without being taken to hospital because there was no functional hospital in the remote village.

The village head appealed to the government to come to their rescue and save their children from dying.

"We are really disturbed because the children kept dying. As we speak today [Sun 21 Jul 2019], we buried 3 children and this thing started 2 months ago. We are appealing to government to come and help us," he said.

One of the parents who lost his 1.5-year-old daughter told our reporter that the people in the community were now afraid as they were not sure if measles were responsible for the deaths of the children.

"We all thought it was measles that is killing our children and so we rushed to inform the Local Government health officers but they didn't visit us until the situation became worse and we don't even have a functional Primary Health Care centre in the village.

"Let me tell you, since the outbreak in May [2019], we have so far lost about 100 children in the village because hardly a day passes by without us burying 4 children. Most of these children are of age 2-3 years old.

The Director of Public Health, Ministry of Health, Dr Ado Zakari, confirmed the outbreak but said the figures quoted of the dead children were not as high as the locals mentioned.

He promised to get official figures as he said already, a team from the ministry had been sent to the community to make assessment.

Last week [week of 15 Jul 2019] an infant was diagnosed with the measles and admitted to Hawke's Bay Hospital. The child was discharged from hospital on [Mon 22 Jul 2019].

The 2nd confirmed case shared the same family and community networks as the 1st, according to Medical Officer of Health Dr Nicholas Jones.

After health authorities confirmed the 1st case on Friday evening [19 Jul 2019], medical staff spoke to 124 people who had been in contact with the infant. [See source URL above for locations of possible exposure.] 28 people are now in isolation at their homes, according to a statement released by Hawke's Bay DHB [District Health Board] on Monday afternoon [22 Jul 2019]. That covered people who had been in contact with the child and weren't immunised, weren't sure if they were immunised, or had some of the early symptoms of the measles.
