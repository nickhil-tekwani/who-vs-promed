A 66-year-old drink vendor says she just recovered from a "kind of"
rheumatic pain in her joints. She suffered high fevers at night and
drastic chills in the morning, forcing her to stay in bed for 2
weeks. "I had never heard of chikungunya until people said that's
what I was suffering from. It's terrible," she told the Jakarta Globe
in front of Bekasi Hospital in West Java. She is now fully
recuperated, though the cheap, over-the-counter flu drugs she used
probably had little to do with her recovery.

Bekasi, located on the outskirts of Jakarta, has a long history of
chikungunya [virus infections], with the last serious outbreak taking
place in 2002. "It's a typical suburban disease," said Rita
Kusriastuti, the Health Ministry's director of Vector-Borne Diseases.
"The mosquitoes that transmit the virus like plants and farm areas,
[as well as] puddles." [_Aedes aegypti_ breeds in water catchments in
and around houses, in both rural and urban areas. - Mod.TY]

She said that in the past few months, chikungunya [virus] had spread
to many parts of the country, with Lampung and Bangka-Belitung
provinces reporting the highest number of cases -- primarily in
suburban and semi-rural districts. Cases also have been reported in
parts of Java and Kalimantan.

According to state-run Antara news agency, the ministry reported that
almost 20 000 people were infected with chikungunya from January to
February [2010] in Lampung alone. That is more than the total number
of dengue fever cases in the province in a typical year.

The ministry, Rita said, has been working to curb the transmission of
the disease through public awareness campaigns. "We ask people to
keep their surroundings and water supply clean to prevent their
backyards from becoming breeding grounds for mosquitoes," she said.
She said fumigation campaigns also had been introduced to kill
mosquitoes in areas suffering particularly bad outbreaks.

However, Rita said the rise in the number of cases over the 1st 3
months of the year [2010] pointed to the possibility of insecticide
resistance among adult mosquitoes as a result of the frequent
fumigation. "We haven't scientifically looked into the possibility.
But, overall, the situation is still under control," she said.

The name "chikungunya" is derived from a Swahili word that means
"that which bends up," apparently a reference to the stooped posture
that develops due to the arthritis-like symptoms of the disease. Upik
Kesumawati Hadi, an entomologist from the Bogor Institute of
Agriculture, said that clinically, chikungunya was not considered a
serious threat because it was a self-limiting disease that would
resolve itself. She added that the length of the recovery period for
chikungunya ranged from one week to one month, depending on an
individual's immune system. "It's a problem because sufferers cannot
go about their normal activities, which means not being able to
work," she said. "The only effective preventive measure for the
spread of chikungunya [virus transmission] is to break the vector's
cycle," she said.

Upik said that contrary to popular belief, _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes
could bite humans at anytime of the day, although they preferred dusk
and dawn.
