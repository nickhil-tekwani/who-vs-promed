Some 2 months after the country earned its polio-free tag, a mosquito has emerged as a fresh concern. Mosquito-borne West Nile virus has been found to be causing acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), the main symptom of poliomyelitis, for the 1st time in India. The symptom is the most common sign of acute polio and is used for surveillance during polio outbreaks.

However, unlike polio, which is a childhood disease, West Nile [virus]-induced AFP is seen in adults. So, the finding is not going to undermine the success of polio-free certification, say researchers, but is still reason for concern. Nationwide AFP surveillance is the gold standard to detect polio cases.

Neurologists from hospitals in Kochi, Kerala along with virologists from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) designated virology laboratory Manipal Centre for Virus Research (MCVR), Manipal University have reported 3 laboratory confirmed cases of West Nile virus-induced AFP, a syndrome historically associated with infection by polio virus.

[This is only the 2nd ProMED-mail post of cases of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in India, and the 1st report in India of flaccid paralysis due to infection by that virus.

The USA CDC indicates that WNV infection can cause acute flaccid paralysis that is usually clinically and pathologically identical to poliovirus-associated poliomyelitis, with damage of anterior horn cells, and may progress to respiratory paralysis requiring mechanical ventilation. WNV poliomyelitis often presents as isolated limb paresis or paralysis and can occur without fever or apparent viral prodrome (http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/healthCareProviders/healthCareProviders-ClinLabEval.html). In addition to WNV infections, acute flaccid paralysis, with clinical and pathological features similar to those of poliomyelitis, has also been associated with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection (http://www.cdc.gov/japaneseencephalitis/healthCareProviders/healthCareProviders-ClinLabEval.html).

With both Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus circulating in India, diagnosing which of these 2 viruses is responsible for a given encephalitis or flaccid paralysis case serologically can be a challenge due to cross reactions between these 2 flaviruses. Virus isolation or demonstration of viral RNA by PCR is more reliable. It would be of interest to know which tests were used to establish the WNV diagnosis in the above cases. The differential diagnosis is important given that, as the above report states, India is listed as in polio free status, a laudable and noteworthy achievement.

Manipal is a suburb within Udupi city and is administered by Udupi City Municipality. It is located in the rocky hinterland of the Malabar Coast of southwest India.
