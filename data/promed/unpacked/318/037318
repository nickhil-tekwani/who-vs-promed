Indigenous populations from Australia, Canada, and New Zealand have
been found to have a 3 to 8 times higher rate of hospitalization and
death associated with infection with the 2009 pandemic influenza A
(H1N1) virus (1). In October 2009, 2 U.S. states (Arizona and New
Mexico) observed a disproportionate number of deaths related to H1N1
among American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs). These observations,
plus incomplete reporting of race/ethnicity at the national level,
led to formation of a multidisciplinary workgroup composed of
representatives from 12 state health departments, the Council of
State and Territorial Epidemiologists, tribal epidemiology centers,
the Indian Health Service, and CDC. The workgroup assessed the burden
of H1N1 influenza deaths in the AI/AN population by compiling
surveillance data from the states and comparing death rates. The
results indicated that, during 15 Apr to 13 Nov 2009, AI/ANs in the
12 participating states had a [pandemic] H1N1 mortality rate 4 times
higher than persons in all other racial/ethnic populations combined.
Reasons for this disparity in death rates are unknown and need
further investigation; however, they might include a high prevalence
of chronic health conditions (e.g., diabetes and asthma) among AI/ANs
that predisposes them to influenza complications, poverty (e.g., poor
living conditions), and delayed access to care. Efforts are needed to
increase awareness among AI/ANs and their health-care providers of
the potential severity of influenza and current recommendations
regarding the timely use of antiviral medications. Efforts to promote
the use of 2009 H1N1 influenza monovalent vaccine in AI/AN
populations should be expanded.

In November 2009, all state health departments were invited to
participate in the workgroup investigation by providing data on
influenza-related deaths among their residents. 12 states (Alabama,
Alaska, Arizona, Michigan, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma,
Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming) chose to
participate, representing 50 percent of the AI/AN population in the
United States. An H1N1 death was defined as a death in a resident of
a participating state reported during 15 Apr to 13 Nov 2009 with any
positive result from an influenza test, including rapid enzyme
immunoassay, direct or indirect influenza fluorescent antibody,
real-time reverse transcription--polymerase chain reaction assay
(rRT-PCR), or viral culture. Because greater than 99 percent of
influenza specimens tested during the study period had been found to
be H1N1, all cases with a positive influenza test were presumed to be
[pandemic] H1N1 and not seasonal influenza. Race/ethnicity and
influenza risk status* of decedents were determined through review of
death certificates, medical records, or death investigation reports.
CDC-defined groups at higher risk for influenza complications were
used to classify decedents as at high risk for influenza
complications. Bridged-race vintage 2008 postcensal population
estimates** were used by all states to determine population data for
rate calculations. Death rates by race/ethnicity were age adjusted to
the 2000 U.S. standard population. Using rate ratios, AI/AN death
rates were compared with death rates for all other racial/ethnic
populations, including deaths in persons of unknown race.

A total of 426 H1N1 deaths were reported by the 12 states during 15
Apr to 13 Nov 2009 (tabulated in the original text). 42 deaths (9.9
percent) occurred among AI/ANs, although AI/ANs make up approximately
3 percent of the total population in the 12 states. The overall AI/AN
H1N1-related death rate was 3.7 per 100 000 population, compared with
0.9 per 100 000 for all other racial/ethnic populations combined,
resulting in a mortality rate ratio of 4.0. Age group-specific
H1N1-related death rates were 3.5 for persons aged 0 to 4 years, 1.1
for persons aged 5 to 24 years, 4.2 for persons aged 25 to 64 years,
and 7.2 for persons aged 65 years or older. In all age groups, the
AI/AN death rate was higher than the rate for all other racial/ethnic
populations combined.

Among the AI/AN deaths related to H1N1, 81.0 percent of decedents had
high-risk health conditions, compared with 77.6 percent of persons in
all other racial/ethnic populations combined (data tabulated in the
original text). In addition, greater percentages of AI/AN decedents
had asthma (31.0 percent) and diabetes (45.2 percent) than decedents
in all other racial/ethnic populations combined (14.1 percent asthma
and 24.0 percent diabetes).

MMWR Editorial Note:
----------------------
The AI/AN population is culturally diverse and spread among
approximately 560 federally recognized tribal communities in 34
states and multiple urban areas (2). Health disparities between the
AI/AN population and other racial/ethnic populations are well
documented (3). Mortality rates and trends for respiratory diseases
indicate that AI/ANs are at increased risk for death resulting from
pneumonia and influenza (4,5). Although AI/AN death rates varied
among the 12 participating states in this study, the aggregate AI/AN
H1N1-related death rate from 12 states was 4 times higher than that
of all other racial/ethnic groups combined.

The higher mortality rate among AI/ANs observed in this investigation
is consistent with reports of increased influenza-related morbidity
and mortality among indigenous populations in other parts of the
world during the current H1N1 pandemic and also is consistent with
observations from previous pandemics (1,2). After the influenza
pandemic of 1918-19, U.S. government investigators reported that
influenza-related mortality rates among AI/ANs were 4 times higher
than the rates observed among persons in general urban populations (2).

The factors that produce a higher influenza mortality rate among
AI/ANs are unknown but might include higher prevalence of underlying
chronic illness such as diabetes. The age-specific prevalence of
diabetes in AI/AN adults is 2-3 times higher than for all U.S. adults
(6). In addition, AI/ANs are twice as likely to have unmet medical
needs because of cost (7). AI/ANs also have the highest poverty rate
(30 percent), which is twice the national rate and 3 times the rate
for whites among households with children aged less than 18 years
(8), suggesting that delayed access to medical care and living
conditions associated with poverty might contribute to their higher
influenza mortality rate.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 5 limitations.
1st, AI/AN decedents often are mis-classified as persons of other
races on death certificates, decreasing the number of A1/AN deaths by
as much as 30 percent in some reports (9). 2nd, the time lags in
reporting of deaths and the manner in which states collect death data
and classify decedents as at high risk for influenza complications
might vary and affect rate ratios in an unpredictable manner. 3rd,
race and ethnicity were unknown for 19 deaths, although for a
conservative comparison, these deaths were included with the combined
group of all other racial/ethnic populations. 4th, greater incidence
of influenza disease among AI/ANs might have contributed to the
higher mortality rate; however, the incidence of disease among AI/ANs
is unlikely to be so much greater than all other populations that it
could account for a mortality rate that is 4 times higher. Data on
race/ethnicity are not collected consistently for influenza patients.
Finally, although over 99 percent of all identified influenza strains
in the United States during the investigation period were thought to
be H1N1, confirmation by rRT-PCR or viral culture was not required
for inclusion in this analysis.

Effective public health responses to influenza will depend on
accurate and complete reporting of race/ethnicity in all state and
federal mortality surveillance systems. Community education regarding
the risk for influenza mortality among AI/ANs should be expanded.
Increased efforts should be made to promote awareness among AI/ANs
and their health-care providers about the signs and symptoms of
influenza and recommendations for vaccination and the use of
influenza antiviral medications early in the course of suspected
influenza illness for those at increased risk for complications.
Finally, factors that might contribute to increased influenza-related
mortality in the AI/AN population, including the role of underlying
chronic medical conditions and social determinants of health, should
be topics for future investigation.

[This report demonstrates that American Indian/Alaska Natives
(AI/ANs) in the participating 12 states had a pandemic (H1N1) 2009
mortality rate that was 4 times higher than the rate for all other
racial/ethnic groups combined. If other disadvantaged ethnic groups
had been withdrawn from the comparison, the differences might well
have been more stark. Perhaps a comparison of American Indians,
Alaskan natives and other ethnic groups might provide an estimate of
any genetic component in pandemic H1N1 disease susceptibility.

Health professionals and agencies should endeavor to expand community
education regarding the risk for influenza mortality, ensure access
to and early empiric use of influenza antiviral medication, promote
H1N1 vaccination, and investigate factors contributing to a higher
influenza-related mortality rate among AI/ANs. - Mod.CP]
