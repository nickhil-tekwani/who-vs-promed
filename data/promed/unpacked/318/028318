Re: replies from Infection Control teams:
I notice that they're all heavily oriented toward antibiotic
resistant BACTERIA, as opposed to viruses. And one of them was shrewd
enough to wonder if a real control program would require a separate
e-mail list. It may be too early for that decision, but I'd bet that the
majority of them would include viruses in their activities if they just
had the data.
1. For me, it's a given that most doctors don't know much about
viruses, and hence don't have much interest in them. HOWEVER!
if they had reliable epidemiologic information, I have little
doubt that their interest would pick up. For example, suppose
it's January, and they're seeing a lot of red throats. At the
same time the data posted in their Medical Staff Lounge by
their Infection Control People shows a large increase in
adenovirus type 24, along with a notation that it tends to cause
pharyngitis. I'd bet that the incidence of "strep throat" would
plummet, along with the use of penicillin.
2. Similarly, at any time of year, if the Staff Lounge chart showed
that something definite was "going around," I'd bet that control
measures in both hospitals and doctors' offices would get beefed
up sharply. I recall one ophthalmologist who was an absolute
fanatic about having "infected" people in the same semi-private
room with his surgical patients.
3. I've already seen that when a doctor knows something is "going
around" and learns what symptoms it causes, it will improve his
diagnostic accuracy.
4. Similarly, once he begins to learn a little something about
viruses, he will inevitably start including them in his
differential diagnoses.
5. The ultimate acceptance of a VIRUS-WATCH will come when we have
better drugs or vaccines to treat viruses with. However, until
that time, A GREAT DEAL can be accomplished in terms of awareness,
diagnostic accuracy, and control measures.
6. There's no point in stalling until everything is just peachy keen
and perfect before getting started. Maybe I'm a little slow in
the head, but I've NEVER been able to plan ANY kind of new
program and have it turn out perfectly. It always EVOLVES from
the original, sometimes to the point where the original is hardly
recognizable. Evolution, however, requires some sort of an
embryo to start with, so my vote is definitely to give birth and
let the evolution begin!
