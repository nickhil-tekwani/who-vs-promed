Situation update
----------------
Between 31 Oct and 7 Nov 2019, EU Member States reported a total of 4 human cases: 2 in Italy and one each in Germany and Greece. No cases were reported from EU neighbouring countries. A human case was reported for the 1st time from an area in Germany. This week, 2 deaths were reported by Greece.

In the same time period, one outbreak among equids was reported by Austria to the Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS).

Since the beginning of the 2019 transmission season and as of October 2019, EU Member States and EU neighbouring countries reported 456 human infections. EU Member States reported 404 cases: Greece (223), Romania (66), Italy (48), Hungary (36), Cyprus (16), Bulgaria (5), Austria (4), Germany (3), France (2), and Slovakia (1). EU neighbouring countries reported 52 human cases in Serbia (27), Israel (10), Turkey (9),and North Macedonia (6).

To date, 47 deaths due to West Nile virus infection have been reported by Greece (32), Romania (7), Italy (4), Cyprus (1), Bulgaria (1), North Macedonia (1), and Serbia (1).

During the current transmission season, 85 outbreaks among equids have been reported by Germany (29), Greece (21), France (11), Italy (8), Hungary (7), Austria (4), Spain (4) and Portugal (1). In addition, Germany reported 53 outbreaks among birds to ADNS.

["West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that is related to Japanese encephalitis, St Louis encephalitis, and Murray Valley encephalitis viruses. As the names of the viruses imply, WNV can cause encephalitis, however, as with most infectious diseases, clinical disease is relatively rare. Approximately 75 percent of infections are asymptomatic; 25 percent will be an influenza-like fever (known as West Nile fever/WNF); about 1 percent will be neurologic disease (known as West Nile neurologic disease/WNND); and about 0.1 percent will proceed to a fatal neurologic infection.

"Like many flaviviruses, WNV has a transmission cycle involving mosquitoes and vertebrate hosts. In the case of WNV, it is _Culex_ mosquitoes and birds are the amplifying host. Although Culex mosquitoes can transmit the virus to a variety of vertebrate hosts, these are dead-end hosts due to low viremias and cannot transmit the virus to other vertebrates nor can the virus be transmitted to uninfected mosquitoes. Nonetheless, vertebrate hosts, including human and horses manifest clinical disease."

The West Nile virus "has emerged in both Europe and the Americas to cause periodic large outbreaks. It is difficult to predict where West Nile activity will take place as mosquito activity varies according to climatic conditions and, since the vertebrate hosts are birds, migratory birds have the potential to carry the virus long distances. With increasing global travel, the spread of West Nile infections in travelers will also increase."

In Europe, "West Nile emerged in Romania in 1996 with 393 WNND cases and this was followed by another major outbreak in southern Russia in 1999. Since 1999, there has been WNV activity (that is, reports of the virus being detected in either mosquitoes, birds or mammals, including humans) recorded in Europe most years and every year since 2010 with the European West Nile season normally running from June to November."

"There are no human vaccines but there are veterinary vaccines used for horses and animals in zoological gardens in both North America and Europe. Development of a human live attenuated West Nile, DNA and other vaccine platforms for West Nile infections are underway."

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) provides weekly updates during the West Nile season and information on outbreaks and risks of West Nile activity and is an outstanding resource for the current status of West Nile activity in Europe (https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/west-nile-fever/surveillance-and-disease-data/disease-data-ecdc). - Mod.UBA
