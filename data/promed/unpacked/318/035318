There are more than 20 cases of facial paralysis in federal hospitals in Guanajuato.

Daniel Alberto Díaz Martínez, Secretary of Health of Guanajuato, points out that until now the causes have not been found, but overall the cause of the paralysis continues to be investigated, which were publicly reported last week, although they have been detected for the past one month, to date.

The state official explained that so far the investigation does not point to a relationship with the cases of aseptic meningitis that have been detected in Durango state and that have left several people dead.

"We have not identified any case that is related to what we have seen in Durango; we are investigating whether these neurological manifestations are atypical behavior and ruling out that they have to do with an infection associated with medical care, but we haven't found cases of encephalitis, meningitis, and possibly aseptic, as such, in the state. I thank the IMSS for reporting the cases," declared the Secretary of Health. He added that the investigation is continuing and until there is a result, it is not possible to speculate on the reasons, and also asked the population not to panic.

"We have been working since Friday, Saturday, and Sunday [2-4 Dec 2022] and we have no elements to say that there is any relationship with what is happening in Durango and no reason to worry the population. If there is something we will make it known (...) they are more than 20 cases, but they are not similar to what is happening in Durango; once we finish the investigation we will let you know the results," said the health official.

[The outbreak in Durango, Mexico referred to in the news report above is fungal meningitis due to epidural injections of a contaminated anesthetic drug at several different hospitals in Durango City that involved 59 patients, including 9 deaths, when ProMED last posted a report of this outbreak (ProMED post Fungal meningitis - Mexico: (DU) fatal, epidural anesthetic, RFI 20221123.8706866). The article at https://www.publimetro.com.mx/guanajuato/2022/12/01/guanajuato-investigan-paralisis-faciales-en-pacientes-ante-alerta-de-meningitis-en-durango/ reports more than 60 cases and 18 deaths as of 1 Dec 2022.

Facial paralysis means the inability to move the muscles on one or both sides of the face, resulting in drooping of facial features and problems with speaking, blinking, swallowing saliva, and eating. Paralysis of the face may be temporary or permanent, depending on the etiology.

The muscles involved are innervated by the motor portion of the 7th cranial nerve. Swelling of the peripheral portion of the facial nerve in reaction to an infection can cause pressure on the portion of the 7th cranial nerve within the bony canal through which the nerve travels to reach the side of the face, leading to the restriction of blood and oxygen to the nerve cells and resulting facial paralysis of both the upper and lower half of the face, with smoothing of the brow, open eye or incomplete lid closure, flattened nasolabial fold, and drooping of the mouth on the same side of the lesion.

Supranuclear (or "central") lesions in the brain spare the muscles on the forehead; there is only flattening of the lower half of the face, that is, the nasolabial fold and drooping of the mouth on the side opposite of the brain lesion. This condition is often caused by a stroke.

Most cases of facial paralysis are unilateral. However, Guillain-Barré syndrome, a postinfectious autoimmune disease, usually causes bilateral facial palsy as a result of a demyelinating neuropathy. Facial palsy is also the most common manifestation of Lyme neuroborreliosis, which can be either unilateral or bilateral. About 5 percent of patients with Lyme disease will develop some degree of sudden facial paralysis (https://focus.masseyeandear.org/lyme-disease-and-facial-weakness-what-you-should-know/). Most patients in the northern hemisphere with Lyme-related facial paralysis present between June and November, often preceded by systemic prodrome, including fever, malaise, headache, myalgias, and/or arthralgias, 1 to 3 weeks after being infected with _Borrelia_ spirochete following a tick bite.

Reactivation of latent Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the geniculate ganglion is believed to be a common cause of Bell palsy in adults. The geniculate ganglion is located in the bony facial canal; it is a sensory ganglion of the facial nerve, responsible for conducting taste sensation from the anterior 2/3 of the tongue. Fibers of the facial nerve that travel adjacent to the geniculate ganglion have involvement in all other functions of the nerve and lesions at the level of the ganglion can interfere with both sensory and motor components of the facial nerve (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK555950/). Murakami et al performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay testing on the endoneurial fluid of the facial nerve in patients who underwent surgery for Bell palsy and found HSV in 11 of 14 cases, but not in 9 patients with the Ramsay-Hunt syndrome or in 12 other controls (https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/0003-4819-124-1_Part_1-199601010-00005).

Varicella zoster virus reactivation, with and without the Ramsay Hunt syndrome with accompanying zoster lesions, is an important cause of acute peripheral facial paralysis. It can occur in children, especially those between 6 and 15 years of age (https://journals.lww.com/pidj/Abstract/2005/02000/Varicella_Zoster_Virus_Reactivation_Is_an.2.aspx). Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus) facial palsy, accompanied by a painful blistering rash on the eardrum, ear canal, earlobe, tongue, and roof of the mouth on the side with the affected nerve.

Physical trauma to the base of the skull can damage the facial nerve within the bony facial canal and cause facial palsy.

However, none of these unusual causes of facial paralysis could easily explain an outbreak of more than 20 cases of facial paralysis in the past month in Guanajuato (pop., about 1.6 million in 2020), Mexico. Bell's palsy, an acute onset unilateral facial paralysis of unknown cause, is the most frequent cause of facial paralysis (https://www.ninds.nih.gov/bells-palsy-fact-sheet) and affects about 40 000 people in the United States every year (http://www.neurocntr.com/bells-palsy.php).

However, common exposure to a transmissible virus or toxin is possible. ProMED previously reported a case of meningoencephalitis with central facial paralysis, without fever, due to Toscana virus, an arthropod-borne virus that belongs to the genus _Phlebovirus_ that was acquired near Marseille, in southern France in 2014 (Toscana virus - France: (southeast), transient central facial paralysis 20141204.3012272). A case of facial paralysis was associated with the use of the antibiotic linezolid (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16863496/). A case of facial paralysis was reported to have followed acute dichloromethane exposure, indicating a possible peripheral neurotoxic effect of this solvent (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16254952/, as well as having followed organophosphate exposure (https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/american-medical-association/bell-s-palsy-following-organophosphate-poisoning-BCwJNo6GrZ), ethylene glycol exposure (https://www.hindawi.com/journals/crim/2013/460250/), and polyethylene glycol exposure (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2487768/).

We are given no information concerning patient characteristics, clinical manifestations (other than facial paralysis), the timeline over which the cases of facial paralysis in Guanajuato have occurred, or any epidemiologic linkages among the more than 20 cases. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Guanajuato, in central Mexico, is one of the 32 states in the Federal Entities of Mexico; Guanajuato's capital city is Guanajuato. A map showing the location of Guanajuato can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Guanajuato,+Mexico. - Mod.ML
