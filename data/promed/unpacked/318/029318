Five more children in San Diego have tested
positive for measles, bringing to 11 the total
number of cases in a month-long outbreak that has
[affected] schools, supermarkets, the Del Mar
fairgrounds and Hawaii, county officials said
Friday [15 Feb 2008]. Public health experts are
awaiting test results for a 12th case. They also
have discovered 2 more children suspected of
having measles but who don't seem to be linked to the outbreak.

One of the newly confirmed patients is an
8-year-old who may have spread the virus during a
31 Jan 2008 visit to the fairgrounds to see
"Corteo," a performance by the group Cirque du
Soleil. He or she may have infected spectators
and employees at the 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. shows. The
child also may have infected people during [visits to 2 local supermarkets].

"It is extremely important that people,
particularly children, are aware that they may
have been exposed to measles," said Dr. Wilma
Wooten, the county's public health officer. The
potentially fatal and highly contagious disease
takes several weeks to run its course. Wooten
said there's no longer an infection risk at the
fairgrounds and 2 supermarkets because the
measles virus can't survive for more than 2 hours
after it is expelled by a cough or sneeze.

The outbreak -- San Diego County's 1st since 1991
-- began in Switzerland and has spanned about
half the globe. All the patients, from infants to
a 9-year-old, were not vaccinated either because
they were younger than one -- the minimum age for
measles inoculation -- or because their parents
objected to having them vaccinated. Health
officials in San Diego and Hawaii have been
toiling into the night to contact the hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of individuals potentially
exposed to measles. These health officials are
seeking prospective patients linked to the San
Diego Cooperative Charter School in Linda Vista;
Children's Clinic of La Jolla in Bird Rock;
Alcott Elementary and the School of the
Madeleine, both in Clairemont; Baldwin Academy
and Murray Callan Swim School, both in Pacific
Beach; the fairgrounds; and 2 supermarkets in
Hillcrest. They also are contacting the roughly
250 passengers who may have been exposed to
measles from an infected child aboard Hawaiian
Airlines Flight 15, which left Lindbergh Field on
9 Feb 2008. Also potentially affected are people
who were at the airport's Terminal 2, Gate 41
between 8:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. that day.

The outbreak began when a 7-year-old returned
from a family vacation in Switzerland on 15 Jan
2008 infected with measles. More than 400 cases
of measles occur in Switzerland each year, about
triple the total in the United States. The
7-year-old goes to the charter school in Linda
Vista. He or she set off a chain reaction that
has infected 2 siblings and at least 4
classmates. The 8-year-old patient identified
Friday [15 Feb 2008] is a classmate of the
7-year-old. On 25 Jan 2008, the 7-year-old's
parents took the youngster to the Children's
Clinic of La Jolla. The child may have coughed
and sneezed in the office, thus infecting 4 other
children. Those 4 patients returned to the clinic
between 5 and 8 Feb 2008, possibly spreading the virus to 60 other children.

Dr. Alisa Lawrie, a pediatrician at the
Children's Clinic of La Jolla, said Wednesday [13
Feb 2008] that "the outbreak should send a clear
message to parents about the danger of not
vaccinating their children. This could have been
prevented if we had a fully vaccinated public;
there's a lot of misinformation about vaccines,
and more and more parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children."

[The message that is clearly taken from this
outbreak is that measles is a highly
transmissible disease. It has a documented 90
percent attack rate among secondary susceptible
contacts -- via respiratory droplet route.
Airborne transmission via aerosolized droplet
nuclei has been documented in closed areas (e.g.,
office examination room) for up to 2 hours after
a person with measles occupied the area. (see CDC
Pink Book, Measles chapter
<http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/meas.pdf>).
Cases are shedding virus during the prodromal
period up through 3-4 days following onset of
rash. Hence, most frequently when patients are
taken to the health sector for diagnosis and
treatment, they are often in the most highly
infectious stage of the illness. Unvaccinated
individuals are at high risk of infection when
exposed to the virus, and serve as further
transmitters of the virus when they become infected.

Cases that have occurred in the less than one
year of age cohort had not as yet reached the
recommended age for starting vaccination with
measles containing vaccine. Those cases who were
school age, whose parents decided the risk of
vaccine was too great, even in the absence of
good scientific data supporting that belief, are
in the cadre the public health sector refers to
as "preventible cases" as the current vaccine
used has been demonstrated to produce serologic
evidence of immunity in 95 percent of recipients
who receive a single dose at 12 months of age, 98
percent of recipients who receive a single dose
at 15 months of age, and 99 percent of those who
receive 2 doses of vaccine (provided the 1st dose
is received no earlier than 12 months of
age). With today's marked reduction in measles
activity, the general population does not
know/remember that measles carries a significant
risk of adverse events associated with the actual
disease with children less than 5 years of age
and adults greater than 20 years of age at higher
risk. Approximately 30 percent of measles cases
have some complication: diarrhea occurring in 8
percent, otitis media in 7 percent and pneumonia
(either primary viral pneumonia or secondary
bacterial pneumonia) in 6 percent with pneumonia
being the most common cause of death related to
measles. Other complications include acute
encephalitis (0.1 percent of cases but carrying a
15 percent fatality rate), seizures (0.6-0.7
percent). In the USA, the overall case fatality
rate for measles was 0.2 percent, but in
developing countries with high rates of
malnutrition, the case fatality rate has been
reported to be as high as 20 to 30
percent. Another mostly forgotten complication
of measles was subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE) -- a degenerative
neurologic disease felt to be due to persistent
central nervous system infection with measles
virus that appeared an average of 7 years
following initial infection, and was reported at
a rate of 5-10 cases per million reported. SSPE
has virtually disappeared since the widespread use of measles vaccine.

The data are clearly there to support the measles
vaccination programs. This moderator will stop
here, letting the readers come to their own
conclusions about the impact of the antivaccination movement.
