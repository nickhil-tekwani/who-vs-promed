Rift Valley fever in Madagascar
-------------------------------
As of Thu 17 Apr 2008, the Ministry of Health, Madagascar, has
reported a total of 418 suspected cases including 17 deaths (CFR 4
percent) of Rift Valley fever from Alaotra Mangoro, Analamanga,
Itasy, Vakinakaratra and Anosy Regions.

Infection with Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) has been laboratory
confirmed in 59 human cases by the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar, a
WHO Collaborating Centre for Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers and partner in
the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.

The Ministry of Health, Madagascar, has established an
inter-ministerial committee to oversee the response to the outbreak.
Control measures implemented have included case management,
surveillance, social mobilization, provision of medicines, prevention
and strengthening of hospital infection control.

The Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) has reported the RVF in animals to
the OIE on 9 Apr 2008.

The MoH and MoA have requested the support of a joint WHO, FAO, OIE
mission to support outbreak response efforts.

[The following information is taken from the WHO "Overview of Rift
Valley fever" which is available in full at
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs207/en/>.

"Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects
animals but also has the capacity to infect humans. Infection can
cause severe disease in both animals and humans, leading to high
rates of disease and death. The disease also results in significant
economic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected
livestock."

(Human disease is preceded by animal disease and the cases of human
disease described in the preceding report are indicative of the
existence of extensive disease in livestock. Rift Valley fever virus
has circulated in livestock in Madagascar for several years -- see
the ProMED-mail references listed below. - Mod.CP)

"RVF virus is a member of the genus _Phlebovirus_, one of the 5
genera in the family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus was 1st identified in
1931 during an investigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm
in the Rift Valley of Kenya. Since then, outbreaks have been reported
in sub-Saharan and North Africa. In 1997-98, a major outbreak
occurred in Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania and in September 2000, RVF
cases were confirmed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, marking the 1st
reported occurrence of the disease outside the African continent and
raising concerns that it could extend to other parts of Asia and
Europe.

"The vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect
contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can
be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during
slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting
veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.

"Certain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse
workers and veterinarians are therefore at higher risk of infection.
The virus infects humans through inoculation; for example, via a
wound from an infected knife or through contact with broken skin, or
through inhalation of aerosols produced during the slaughter of
infected animals. The aerosol mode of transmission has also led to
infection in laboratory workers.

"There is some evidence that humans may also become infected with RVF
by ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals.
Human infections have also resulted from the bites of infected
mosquitoes, most commonly the _Aedes_ mosquito. Transmission of RVF
virus by hematophagous (blood-feeding) flies is also possible.

"To date, no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented,
and no transmission of RVF to health care workers has been reported
when standard infection control precautions have been put in place.
There has been no evidence of outbreaks of RVF in urban areas. In
mild form of RVF in humans the incubation period (interval from
infection to onset of symptoms) for RVF varies from 2 to 6 days.
Those infected either experience no detectable symptoms or develop a
mild form of the disease characterized by a feverish syndrome with
sudden onset of flu-like fever, muscle pain, joint pain and
headache.Some patients develop neck stiffness, sensitivity to light,
loss of appetite and vomiting; in these patients the disease, in its
early stages, may be mistaken for meningitis. The symptoms of RVF
usually last from 4 to 7 days, after which time the immune response
becomes detectable with the appearance of antibodies and the virus
gradually disappears from the blood.

"While most human cases are relatively mild, a small percentage of
patients develop a much more severe form of the disease. This usually
appears as one or more of 3 distinct syndromes: ocular (eye) disease
(0.5-2 percent of patients), meningoencephalitis (less than 1
percent) or haemorrhagic fever (less than 1 percent).

"The total case fatality rate has varied widely between different
epidemics but, overall, has been less than 1 percent in those
documented. Most fatalities occur in patients who develop the
haemorrhagic icterus form. An inactivated vaccine has been developed
for human use. However, this vaccine is not licensed and is not
commercially available. It has been used experimentally to protect
veterinary and laboratory personnel at high risk of exposure to RVF.
Other candidate vaccines are under investigation.

"Forecasting can predict climatic conditions that are frequently
associated with an increased risk of outbreaks, and may improve
disease control. In Africa, Saudi Arabia and Yemen RVF outbreaks are
closely associated with periods of above-average rainfall. The
response of vegetation to increased levels of rainfall can be easily
measured and monitored by Remote Sensing Satellite Imagery. In
addition RVF outbreaks in East Africa are closely associated with the
heavy rainfall that occurs during the warm phase of the El Nino/
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. These findings have enabled
the successful development of forecasting models and early warning
systems for RVF using satellite images and weather/climate
forecasting data. Early warning systems, such as these, could be used
to detect animal cases at an early stage of an outbreak enabling
authorities to implement measures to avert impending epidemics."

[Madagascar submitted to the OIE an "immediate notification" on this
outbreak on 9 Apr 2008; see, including map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6952>.
According to the report, there were 2 cases (out of 9 susceptible
bovines); no mortality and no destruction or slaughter of any animal.
The diagnostic methods, applied by the National laboratory, were
antibody detection ELISA, IgM-capture ELISA and nested RT-PCR. The
diagnosis was confirmed by OIE's Reference Laboratory in the
Veterinary Institute, Onderstepoort, South Africa. - Mod.AS]
