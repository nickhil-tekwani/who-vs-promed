["West Nile fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease that can affect birds, humans and horses causing inapparent infection, mild febrile illness, meningitis, encephalitis, or death. West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ in the family Flaviviridae. The arbovirus is maintained in nature by cycling through birds and mosquitoes; numerous avian and mosquito species support virus replication. For many avian species, WNV infection causes no overt signs, while other birds, such as American crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_) and blue jays (_Cyanocitta cristata_), often succumb to fatal systemic illness. Among mammals, clinical disease is primarily exhibited in horses and humans.

Clinical signs of WNV infection in horses arise from viral-induced encephalitis or encephalomyelitis. Infections are dependent on mosquito transmission and are seasonal in temperate climates, peaking in the early autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. Affected horses frequently demonstrate mild to severe ataxia. Signs can range from slight incoordination to recumbency. Some horses exhibit weakness, muscle fasciculation, and cranial nerve deficits. Fever is not a consistently recognised feature of the disease in horses.

WNV was recognised as a human pathogen in Africa during the 1st half of the 20th century. Although several WN fever epidemics were described, encephalitis as a consequence of human WN infection was rarely encountered prior to 1996; since then, outbreaks of human WN encephalitis have been reported from France, Greece, Israel, Italy, North America, Romania, Russia and Tunisia. During the 1960s, WN viral encephalitis of horses was reported from Egypt and France. Since 1998, outbreaks of equine WNV encephalitis have been reported from Argentina, Canada, France, Israel, Italy, Morocco, Spain, and the United States of America. In 2011, an outbreak of equine encephalitis due to Kunjin virus, a lineage 1 subtype of WNV, was reported in Australia. There was no evidence of disease in humans or birds caused by this virus.

The occurrence of disease in humans and animals along with bird and mosquito surveillance for WNV activity demonstrate that the virus range has dramatically expanded, including North, Central, and South America as well as Europe and countries facing the Mediterranean Basin."
