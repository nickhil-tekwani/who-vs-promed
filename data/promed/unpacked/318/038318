Authorities say 2 children have died and another 30 are sickened in a mass poisoning at a kindergarten in southwestern China.

Investigators identified the toxic substance as a powerful rat poison, but do not yet know how it was administered Wednesday [19 Mar 2014] in the kindergarten in Yunnan province's rural Qiubei county. State broadcaster CCTV says the school began accepting students last year [2013?] despite not being fully licensed.

Along with the victims, aged 4 and 5, 12 others remained hospitalized Friday [21 Mar 2014], 3 of them in serious condition.

Chinese schools have suffered a series of mass stabbings and other attacks by mentally disturbed people or those bearing grudges. There have also been incidents of school staff administering medication without authorization.

[One has to wonder how the children got exposed to rat poison (rodenticide) at school. Was it something the custodial staff placed that the children found? Or was this an intentional poisoning? Was this one of those grudges?

How did this many children all ingest rodenticide? Was it something that was included in their food? Did they believe it to be some type of candy?

There are numerous rodenticides, or rat poisons as they are commonly called. The most common ones are anticoagulant-based products, meaning they cause some kind of bleeding or clotting disorder. Anticoagulants act by blocking vitamin K clotting factors, especially factors II (prothrombin) and VII (proconvertin), causing the body to be unable to produce clotting factors.

There are 1st and 2nd generation anticoagulant rodenticides; 2nd generation rodenticides are more potent than 1st generation ones. Rodenticides are also divided by class of compound. The coumarin class includes warfarin and coumatetraly. Also included in this class as 2nd generation are difenacoum, brodifacoum, flocoumafen, and bromadiolone. The next class are the 1,3 indandiones. This includes chlorophacinone and diphacinone. Difethialone is also regarded as a 2nd generation anticoagulant.

The most effective treatment for anticoagulants is vitamin K. Hopefully, these children will get appropriate treatment and be healthy soon.
