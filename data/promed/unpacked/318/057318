A massive died-off of the fish called tilapia has been reported in
the river Coco in the Municipality of Santa Rita Uno. Witnesses are
reporting that members of the public are collecting the dead fish.
There are no reports of intoxicated people and the cause of the fish
deaths is still unknown.
Local people blame illegal fishing.

[It is curious why the locals would blame illegal fishing. It is also
curious that this die-off involves only tilapia. Generally, a toxic
or environmental event will affect more than one species. Likewise,
if the fisherman were exploding dynamite in the river, there would be
more than one species affected.
If anyone can provide some accurate information on this situation, we
would appreciate receiving it. - Mod.TG]
