[There is no mention of this man receiving post-exposure treatment for rabies, so one must presume he did not receive any treatment, once again demonstrating how lethal it can be to forego or be denied proper prompt treatment when exposed. As the incubation period was so very short, the dose must have been high, and the virus had but a short distance to reach his brain.
