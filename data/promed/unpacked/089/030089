A team of Argentinian scientists identified the 1st case in Latin America of a patient infected with a fungus commonly associated with plants. The pathogen bears the scientific name of _Pseudozyma aphidis_ and has been isolated from the leaves of cherries, apples, and grass in different parts of the world.

There are very few cases reported of human beings affected with that pathogen. "The patients infected with this fungus often suffer from some form of immunosuppression which predisposes them to suffer opportunistic infections. That is the situation with this patient, who suffers from a form of bone cancer," indicated the biologist Maria Eugenia Bosco Boregeat, who is in charge of the Yeast Laboratory of the Micology Department of the Dr Carlos G Malbran National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID).

The patient was admitted to the Children's Hospital of the Holy Trinity of Cordoba with a high fever and low count of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell which increases in the presence of bacterial and fungal infection and diminishes the effect of the underlying disease, like chemotherapy treatment). "In these cases, it is fundamental to implement as soon as possible a correct antimicrobial therapy to eliminate the infection," said Bosco Borgeat.

The fungus _Pseudozyma aphidis_ could not be identified by the routine tests used at a hospital laboratory, and so samples were sent to NIID for more specific analysis. "We were able to isolate the pathogen from the blood and determine its species by sequencing specific regions of DNA," explained Bosco Borgeat. After 14 days of treatment with antifungal drugs, the patient no longer presented symptoms of infection and was confirmed to be infection-free with blood samples, and so was released from the hospital.

Some of the possible points of entry of fungus into an organism are venous catheters paced in patients, inhalation, and penetration through the gastrointestinal mucus, according to the specialist, who added that the prevalence of infections caused by this pathogen is unknown. "However, it is important to remember that it circulates in our region. We have to pay attention, not underestimate the possibility of infection, and implement treatment in time, as was done with this case," she affirmed.

[The report is actually not the 1st Latin American case of infection due to this organism, but rather the 1st with fungemia in Latin America and is published as: Orecchini LA, Olmos E, Taverna CG, et al. First Latin American case of fungemia due to _Pseudozyma aphidis_ in a pediatric patient with osteosarcoma. J Clin Microbiol. 2015 Aug 19. pii: JCM.01095-15.

_Pseudozyma_ spp. are yeast-like fungi, classified in the Ustilaginales, which are mostly epiphytic or saprophytic and are not generally pathogenic to plants. - Mod.LL
