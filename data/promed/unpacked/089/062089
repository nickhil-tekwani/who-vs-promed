[A request for more information on cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province, Pakistan, was sent to the EpiCore surveillance project volunteers based in Pakistan; below is a synopsis of the responses received. ProMED-mail is grateful for the rapid responses to help clarify the ongoing response effort and is impressed with the detail and speed of the responses received from the EpiCore members in Pakistan. - Mod.EP]

Cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic in some districts of Province KPK and Agencies of FATA [Federal Administrated Tribal Areas] since 2008-9 or probably before that, but after the end of the DEWS [Disease Early Warning System] WHO program it came to surface and limelight as well.

According to DHIS [District Health Information Software] Program and data from the Integrated Vector Management Program (IVMP) this year [2016] so far, 758 cases have been reported from District Karak, while 129 cases from Nowshehra District and around 50 cases from District Mardan in the same time period.

Medicines, mainly Glucantime, were initially provided by WHO, ICRC [International Committee of the Red Cross] and MSF [Médecins Sans Frontières] but later on the Health Department included this [Glucantime] in their regular procurement of yearly medicines, but the amount of government procurement was not enough to cover the burden.

Health Department is still asking for support from the WHO at times, but with the closure of EHA fund of WHO (DEWS), now even they cannot offer support. New government procurement of medicines will be followed in a few months and will help in catering the issue to an extent.

Regarding vector control activities, the best way is to do IRS [indoor residual spraying] inside the houses but that's again a costly activity which needs reasonable funds in government machinery or support of any NGO.

Disease is endemic in different parts of KPK including district Karak. The disease is spreading continuously in Pakistan and neighboring country Afghanistan. Most of the cases are presenting from FATA and KPK.

Some cases have also been reported from Punjab, Baluchistan and Sindh [provinces]. According to the health department record there were more than 3200 cases in 2014 and 2500 cases in 2015; the most affected districts are Chitral, Karak, Kohat, Nowshera and Peshawar.

WHO and health departments are in close coordination to solve the issue. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has launched a DFID [Department for International Development] funded Integrated Disease Surveillance System in 6 districts including district Karak, to ascertain information about health indicators and take desired measures to prevent outbreak of diseases. Improved surveillance is probably the result of this pilot project to detect more cases in the area. Under the same project, preventive and control activities have been launched in the district to overcome the situation.

[ProMED thanks the EpiCore network for the comments to our posting on cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The incidence is increasing and it seems that a combination of inadequate government support, paired with decreasing international support primarily through the WHO, explains the lack of treatment facilities and vector control. The reports mention an increased surveillance, which is important, but without support for vector control at the same time and provision of treatment of the cases, surveillance alone will not solve the problem. - Mod.EP
