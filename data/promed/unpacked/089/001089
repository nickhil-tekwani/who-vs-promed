Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever in Iran; 1 Jan to 31 Dec 2002
---------------------------------------------------
This is the last report on Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in
Iran from the Pasteur Institute of Iran in Tehran and the Pasteur
Institute of Dakar for the period 1 Jan to 31 Dec 2002, which
completes our report of Tue 27 Aug 2002 to ProMED-mail [see:
"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever - Iran (05) 20020827.5163"].
In 2002, we tested serologically by ELISA and molecularly by RT-PCR
556 sera from 252 patients. Sera were tested for IgM and IgG against
the following viral antigens: Rift Valley fever virus, yellow fever
virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus type 2, chikungunya virus, and
CCHF virus. RT-PCR for CCHF virus was performed on negative,
IgM-positive, and double IgM/IgG positive sera. Among the 252
patients, we found 104 IgM positive patients (41.26 percent)
(confirmed); 7 persons among the confirmed cases died (6.73 percent).
Among the confirmed cases, 19 tested RT-PCR positive (18.26 percent).
During this period, the patients were from 8 of the 28 provinces of
Iran. However in the 104 IgM-positive patients we found that the most
infected province in Iran is Sistan-Baluchistan with 80 IgM-positive
patients (76.92 percent). Sistan-Baluchistan borders on Afghanistan
and Pakistan. The other infected provinces are Isfahan, Fars, Tehran,
Khuzistan, Yazd, Chaharmahal-Bakhtiyari, and Hormozgan.
In 148 IgM-negative patients we detected 8 RT-PCR positives (5.4
percent). All tested sera were negative for the other viral antigens.
