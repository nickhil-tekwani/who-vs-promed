45 die from Lassa fever in Sierra Leone
---------------------------------------
Health officials in Sierra Leone on Thursday [8 Oct 2010] said 45
people had died from Lassa fever in the 1st 9 months of the year
including a woman who ran a rat meat restaurant.

The head of the health ministry's national disease surveillance unit,
Foday Dafae, said that up to 152 cases of Lassa fever, which can be
transmitted by bush rats, had so far been confirmed for the same
period. Dafae said tests showed 21 people had come into contact with
the woman and her 6-year-old son, who also died, in the northern city
of Makeni. All others survived after emergency treatment.

According to the official, the disease which has migrated from the
forest region of the east to the savannah grasslands of the north,
causes fever, sore throat, chest pain, diarrhoea and loss of hearing.
Medical experts here said the disease was 1st discovered in the
northern Nigerian village of Lassa in 1969 and it was now endemic in
parts of West Africa including Liberia, Guinea, Senegal and rural Sierra Leone.

[The death of the woman and her son and 7 other cases (3 in serious
condition) were reported on 27 Sep 2010 in the north of the country.
Now it is revealed that in all 21 people contracted Lassa fever
through contact with the deceased woman and all (except her son) have
survived following emergency treatment.

It is now revealed that that during the past 9 months there have been
in total up to 152 cases and 45 deaths in Sierra Leone. It is clear
that a major outbreak of Lassa fever has occurred since normally
about 80 percent of human infections are asymptomatic. Those affected
suffer severe multi-system disease, where the virus affects several
organs in the body, such as the liver, spleen and kidneys. The
incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from 6-21 days. Deafness
occurs in 25 percent of patients of whom half recover some function
after 1-3 months. Transient hair loss and gait disturbance may occur
during recovery. The overall case-fatality rate is 1 percent, and up
to 15 percent among hospitalized patients. Death usually occurs
within 14 days of onset in fatal cases. The disease is especially
severe late in pregnancy, with maternal death and/or fetal loss
occurring in greater than 80 percent of cases during the 3rd trimester.

Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease. The animal reservoir of the virus
causing Lassa fever are rodents of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly
known as the multimammate or bush rat. These rodents when infected
with Lassa virus do not become ill, but they can shed the virus in
their excreta.

Human outbreaks occur in relation to the prevalence of Lassa virus in
the rodent population. Humans usually become infected with Lassa
virus casually from exposure to excreta of infected Mastomy and by
the snaring and preparation of these animals as a source of food.

There is no protective vaccine available but the antiviral drug
ribavirin is an effective treatment for Lassa fever if given early on
in the course of clinical illness.
