When you bring together a large number of bovines, you always stand the
risk of outbreaks of viral diseases as BVD, BRSV and IBR. I think it is
unlikely not to have infections with these viruses, and possible outbreaks
of disease, if you do not take specific precautions. Suboptimal conditions
during transport, such as deprivation of water for -very- long times,
enforce the possibility of all sorts of pathogens to cause problems. As a
third factor there is the "kindergarten-effect". (A great many mild
pathogens are brought together in a group in which a great many individuals
have not had earlier contact with these micro-organisms).
BVD (Bovine Viral Diarrhea) can be introduced by immuno-tolerant
persistently infected animals, or by animals that are viremic because of a
first infection. One to two percent of the dairy cow population are
estimated to be persistently infected with BVD. Roughly said, if you import
more than 50 heifers to your farm, you most likely introduce BVDV (Bovine
Viral Diarrhea Virus) in your herd (if it is not already there).
IBR is a herpesvirus and an infection results in latency of the virus in
the body of the infected animal. Stress, such as shipment and regrouping,
triggers reactivation of IBR virus. These animals start shedding IBR virus.
In a large group of heifers coming from several farms, there will most
likely be a carrier of IBR virus.
BRSV is mildly pathogenic, but can and will cause respiratory disease in
periods of immunodeficiency. Stress, shipment, regrouping, infections with
IBR and BVD all cause immunodeficiency. Also BRSV is likely to give
problems on farms where you bring in large numbers of cows. BRSV is a very
common pathogen worldwide. In the Netherlands close to 100% of bovines
older than 1 year of age have antibodies against BRSV.
And there are more pathogens that will cause pathologic respiratory
changes, after periods of major stress! Think of Parainfluenza virus and
bacteria such as _Pasteurella_ spp., _Haemophilus somnus_, etc.
So we can discuss for a long time about which pathogen causes respiratory
problems on what farm, after shipment and regrouping. The disease is
multifactorial and every event will have it's own pathogens that stand on
the foregrounds. Only good laboratory research and pathology can identify
the specific pathogen(-s) in specific cases. But the greatest challenge is
in preventive measurement. Optimal transport husbandry, good use of
quarantine facilities, vaccination and early detection of disease, etc. are
key words.
I think veterinary advice is often too low on the shopping list of starting
farms, that are in the process of purchasing materials and animals.

As an OIE - IBR representative my initial response (even when the death
rate was much lower than the latest figures -- and I understand no new
deaths have occurred since the turn of the year) was that there was
something other than IBR involved. From the information I have received
from Ms Martynuik it would appear that BVD (types I and II) was probably
not a significant player in the disease scenario.
However, PI3 (a respiratory disease) has been isolated and I have strongly
suggested that BRSV was also involved. No testing facility for BRSV
antibody exists in the local area and so Ms Martynuik is arranging for BRSV
serology on paired acute and convalescent phase samples.
If as seems likely, serological results show BRSV involvement in this case,
and no further losses occur in the immediate future, then pro tem [for the
moment the situation is resolved. However, Ms Martinuik is concerned to
get some "on-site" help and advice to reduce the possibility of a
repetition of this damaging outbreak. We have investigated a few leads in
this direction but there may be other agencies who can help.
