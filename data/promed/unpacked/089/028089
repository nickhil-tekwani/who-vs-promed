Serous [more formally called aseptic or viral - Mod.LL] meningitis rates have increased in Armenia, the press office of Armenia's ministry of health reported. In May-June 2014, a total of 38 cases of acute meningitis were recorded, mainly in the 3-8-years-old age group. No group cases were recorded, according to the report.

The report says enteroviral infections have become more common in a number of countries in May-June 2014, in Georgia, Moldova and Kyrgyzstan in particular.

Instructed by the minister of health, the respective bodies are taking preventive and anti-epidemic measures.

Enteroviral infections cover a wide range of illnesses that are caused by a group of viruses called enteroviruses (EVs). They are members of the Picornaviridae family and are small, icosahedral, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses.

[Although in spring and summer, enteroviruses such as Coxsackie and ECHO are common causes of viral meningitis worldwide, they were not the 1st viruses to be associated with a non-purulent (serous) and generally less pathogenic form of meningitis. It was lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus that was the 1st, and prototypic, agent to cause viral meningitis. Previously, however, a variety of viruses were known to cause an encephalitis type of illness. - Mod.LL
