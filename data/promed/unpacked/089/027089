Thanks for your enquiry re cholera imported into the UK from Pakistan.
I have looked into the case that was reported in July but unfortunately
have been unable to ascertain the area visited by this individual. The
dates of his travel were from 3 Apr - 3rd July 1998.
It may be of interest to you that today we received a further report of
_Vibrio cholerae_01 El Tor Ogawa in a traveller returning from Pakistan.
The dates of travel were 3 - 20 Aug. Again, we were unable to ascertain the
area of travel of this individual.

from countries that are not officially reporting diseases such as cholera
are valuable 'sentinels' - Mod.JW
