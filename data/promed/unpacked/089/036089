Ebola-Reston virus: disease situation in Philippine swine -- an
unfolding situation
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Over the last few weeks, FAO has been engaged with officials at the
Department of Agriculture in Manila and other national and
international agencies (World Health Organization, World Organisation
for Animal Health, US agencies -- Department of Agriculture and
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Australia's Animal
Health Laboratory) to better understand the laboratory findings of
Ebola-Reston virus in pigs. It is the 1st time that this virus, a
known primate pathogen, has been identified in a food-producing animal.

This laboratory finding came about after field investigations and
sample collection was undertaken by the Bureau of Animal Industry
(BAI), Department of Agriculture of the Philippines, because of
suspected outbreaks of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
(PRRS), which had been affecting several swine production areas in
the Philippines characterized by greater virulence then that
described decades earlier in North America and Europe. Such increased
virulence in the PRRS virus (an arterivirus) has also been seen in
China and Viet Nam recently.

The increased awareness and investigation, prompted the BAI to send
samples to a laboratory with experience in PRRS characterization, as
well as rule out other swine pathogens, such as porcine circovirus,
classical swine fever (a pestivirus), or Nipah virus (a
paramyxovirus) using classical and molecular diagnostic laboratory techniques.

During the laboratory investigations, viral particles and generic
sequencing results showed that several of the swine samples were
indeed infected with PRRS virus, circovirus, other agents..., and
Ebola-Reston. No ebolavirus had ever been found in swine tissues before.

[The submitter added the following comment: "Now that we know that
the pathogen has been isolated in the mixing vessel of the pig
populations, what new genomic challenges may evolve that might
present a threat to the international community? -- One thing is
clear, we need to be on top of this game."

The FAO-EMPRES website above includes also the following Q & A, where
subscribers may find useful additional information on the issue:

- What is Ebola, what is Reston, what is Ebola-Reston?
- Sudan Ebola virus
- Tai (Ivory Coast) Ebola virus
- Bundibugyo (Uganda) Ebola virus
- And what is Marburg?
- Hunting for the Ebola reservoirs
- So what is happening in the Philippines?
- Does Reston-Ebola cause disease in pigs?
- Can humans become infected with Reston-Ebola from eating pork?
- What precautionary measures should be observed throughout the food chain?
- What about exports and imports?
- What other animals are known to be infected?

In order to evaluate the realistic animal and public health
implications of the recent findings in the 4 Luzon pig farms, a
scientific report by the investigating laboratory at the Plum Island
Animal Disease Center, including data on the agent's genotyping and
its pathogenicity in animal models, is requested.

According to an APHIS (Animal and Public Health Information System)
Emerging Disease Notice "Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory
Syndrome (PRRS) in Vietnam and China" of August 2007, samples of the
virus from the PRRS outbreak in Viet Nam "were being sent to an
international laboratory for further testing and characterization;" see
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/ceah/cei/taf/emergingdiseasenotice_files/prrschinavietnam2007.pdf>.

Detailed results of the said investigations (published or otherwise)
will be highly appreciated. It will be also interesting to note if
the samples from Viet Nam included tissues of affected porcines; in
case affirmative -- were they tested for other disease agents in
addition to the PRRS virus, and what were the results? - Mod.AS]
