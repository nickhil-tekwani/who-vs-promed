Conservationists at Essex Wildlife Trust fear that myxomatosis -- a disease that up until now has only impacted the rabbit population -- may now have jumped across to hares.

Essex Wildlife Trust has urged people to be vigilant after it said a suspected case of myxomatosis in a hare was reported in north Essex.

A member of the public contacted the Trust after finding the animal near Halstead and should the cause of death be confirmed as myxomatosis it would be the 1st record of a hare with the disease in Essex.

Myxomatosis typically affects rabbits and up until now has not been known to jump across to hares. A number of suspected cases have also been reported in Norfolk and Suffolk in recent weeks and the wildlife trusts from all 3 counties are working with Dr Diana Bell at the University of East Anglia to discover for certain what caused the hares' deaths.

Dr Bell has recently been studying the impacts of diseases on rabbit populations, including myxomatosis, and strains of rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD), but as yet has not confirmed that any of the recent hare deaths were down to myxomatosis.

Conservationists are particularly concerned about any mutation of the virus that might jump across to hares because of the fragility of the hare population. In the past century, hare numbers have declined significantly, especially in the west of the UK, making the relatively healthy hare population in the East region that more precious.

Darren Tansley from Essex Wildlife Trust said: "Hares have suffered from an 80% decline since the late 19th century and their population is not as robust as rabbits. Over time many rabbits develop a resistance to the disease, however there won't be any resistance in hares yet so this outbreak could be extremely detrimental."

Myxomatosis was originally introduced into Australia in 1950 in an attempt to control the rabbit population and 1st reached the UK in 1953, where it was initially considered an effective rabbit bio-control measure. Its deliberate use was banned several years later after it decimated the rabbit population.

The disease, caused by the myxoma virus, is spread by direct contact with an affected animal or from biting insects. Infected rabbits usually die within 14 days of contracting the disease, developing skin tumours, blindness, fatigue, and fever.

Mr Tansley said the Trust was monitoring the situation closely and called on members of the public to report any dead or sick hares which appear to show myxomatosis symptoms and send pictures to the trust. He said: "Nothing has been confirmed as yet but it is important we monitor any potential impact on the population. This is a new phenomenon and should it be myxomatosis we have no idea how rapidly it might spread across the hare population.

"Rabbits are more social than hares and live in large burrow systems where the disease can spread easily -- hares are more solitary and don't burrow, so any virus might take longer to spread."

[Myxomatosis is a viral disease commonly observed in European wild rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_). In case of high prevalence among rabbits, hares can also become infected by myxoma virus. The virus is a natural pathogen of the South American rabbit (_Sylvilagus brasiliensis_), where it causes a relatively localized fibroma. The myxoma virus is an example of a virus that has jumped to other species to produce an exotic disease and then coevolved with its new host. Hares (_Lepus_ spp) are in the same family as rabbits (Leporidae), and can be infected by myxoma virus. The virus is transmitted via blood-feeding arthropods or by close contact between hares and infected rabbits or their excretions. In hares myxomatosis follows a prolonged course with multiple firm subcutaneous nodular masses at the head, back, and limbs. Other viral pathogens that might affect hares are rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus and European brown hare syndrome virus. None of these have so far been confirmed in the dead animals. - Mod.PMB
