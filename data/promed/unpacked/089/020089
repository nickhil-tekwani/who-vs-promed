[1] Sierra Leone: official update
Date: 9 Aug 2014
From: Sidie Yahya Tunis <tunis@health.gov.sl> [edited]


The President of the Republic of Sierra Leone Dr Ernest Bai Koroma, on Saturday [9 Aug 2014], visited the Ebola Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) at the WHO Country Office in Sierra Leone. This is the 2nd visit of the President in 10 days. He made true his promise during his 1st visit on 31 Jul [2014] that he would be following up on the emergency response activities of the EOC.

President Koroma enquired about various response structures including the treatment centres, the laboratories, contact tracing, the emergency call centres, the current status of stocks of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and the training needs of the response personnel during his visit.

The President expressed strong interest in the establishment of 2 additional treatment centres in the Western Area covering the capital city [Freetown] and its suburbs and another in the north to strategically locate treatment facilities for ease of access. He mentioned that there is an ongoing negotiation by Dr Margaret Chan, the WHO Director General, for the establishment of an additional laboratory for the confirmation of cases. Currently, tests are conducted in 2 laboratories in Kailahun and Kenema, which are the 2 epicentres of the outbreak. However, the rapid spread of the disease to other parts of the country has necessitated the urgent need for additional treatment centres and laboratories to minimize the time for the laboratory confirmation of tests and transfer of confirmed cases (patients) to Kenema and Kailahun, both of which are located far away from other parts of the country.

During the briefing session, Dr Jacob Mufunda, WHO Country Representative, updated the President on progress and challenges that are being experienced by the EOC as well as by the field teams. He stated that there is currently a stockpile of 30 000 PPE that is enough for more than 2 months use. He further informed the President of plans by the Chinese government to provide additional 50 000 PPE in the coming week.

Meanwhile, Dr Bannet Ndyanabangi, UNFPA Country Representative, further informed the President of the ongoing training of 900 contact tracers to monitor people who have been exposed to the virus through infected relatives or family members or through other means. He noted that the plan is for each district to have at least 100 contact tracers.

The President visited the 24 Hour Emergency Call Centre within the EOC work station where he received briefing on the operations of the facility. There were more than 10 emergency hotline telephone operators on one of the 3 8-hourly duty rosters at the time of the visit. The President was informed of the flow chart of queries raised by callers through the toll free numbers and the relay of information to the district surveillance officers who are accountable for triggering of required interventions. There is feedback to and from the caller about the outcome of the request. The President expressed satisfaction with the operation of the call centre.

The EOC is the leading coordination centre in the Ebola outbreak response. The body meets every day to discuss the overall national interventions, progress in the response, resource and logistical needs, as well as gaps and challenges at the national level. The meetings are attended mainly by top management of the Ministry of Health, including the Minister, who chairs the meetings, and heads of local and international response partners, including the United Nations agencies, Doctors Without Borders [MSF], the Red Cross and other partners. The meetings are co-chaired by the WHO Country Representative.

[2] Media reports

Reuters roundup 10 Aug 2014 [edited]
-----------------------------------------
Sierra Leone: another doctor sick
---------------
Sierra Leone's Health Ministry said a senior physician had contracted the disease [Ebola] at the Connaught referral hospital in the capital, Freetown. Dr. Modupeh Cole contracted the disease "after treating a patient ... who was later proved to have the virus and died," said ministry spokesman Sidi Yahya Tunis.

Cole was taken to an EVD treatment centre in eastern Kailahun district, run by medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres [MSF], Tunis said. He is the latest Sierra Leonean medical practitioner to contract the virus. The country's leading EVD doctor, Shek Umar Khan, died of the disease last month [July 2014], and several nurses have died.

Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria: national emergencies
----------------
The disease has put a severe strain on the health systems of affected states, and governments have responded with a range of measures, including the declaration of national emergencies in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria, which confirmed 7 cases of Ebola in Lagos.

Liberia: healthcare workers
-------
President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf apologised on Sat 9 Aug 2014 for the high death toll among the country's healthcare workers who have fought an Ebola virus disease [EVD] outbreak which has killed nearly 1000 people in 3 countries. Liberia has lost at least 3 doctors to the virus and 32 health workers. She pledged up to USD 18 million for the EVD fight, part of which will be given to health workers to help with insurance and death benefits, to fund more ambulances, and to increase the number of treatment centres, [speaking to] hundreds of health workers who gathered at Monrovia's City Hall for a meeting with her government. The West African Ebola outbreak, centred on Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, is the worst in history. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Fri 8 Aug 2014 it is an international health emergency that will likely continue spreading for months.

Guinea borders to stay open
------------------
Guinea said earlier on Sat [9 Aug 2014] at a news conference attended by 4 government ministers that it had closed its borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia to halt the spread of EVD. Authorities said the decision was taken primarily to prevent infected people crossing into Guinea, where at least 367 people have died of Ebola since March 2014, and 18 others are being treated in isolation. However, state television later said the borders remained open, in an about-face that appeared to highlight the difficulties governments face in coordinating policy in the face of the fast-moving outbreak. "Guinea has not closed its borders with Sierra Leone nor with Liberia. It's rather that we have taken health measures at the border posts," the television channel said. A government source said the minister who made the original announcement had not been in possession of accurate information.

Quarantine
------------
The rigorous use of quarantine is needed to prevent its spread, as well as high standards of hygiene for anyone who might come into contact with the disease. These measures have proved hard to enforce given that EVD has spread in rural parts of some of the world's poorest countries. The task is made harder because of mistrust of health workers in areas with inadequate public health services.

Ghana: suspected case
---------------
Authorities in Ghana said they were testing samples from a man from Burkina Faso who died while being transported to hospital in the Upper East region. "He had fever and was bleeding from the nose, so we are testing him for Ebola because we don't want to take chances," Yaw Manu, medical head at Bawku Presbyterian Hospital, said by telephone. Ghana has previously conducted about 20 Ebola tests, though none has proved positive.

Benin: suspected case
----------------
Authorities in Benin also said they were testing a patient for EVD, the 2nd suspected case in the country [The 1st was a Nigerian, reported 8 Aug 2014 in ProMED Archive Number 20140808.2673098].

Zambia: travel bans
------------
Zambia said it would restrict the entry of travellers from countries affected by the virus and would ban Zambians from travelling to those countries, in one of the strictest actions by any nation outside of West Africa. Zambia's Health Ministry also advised against holding any "international events" such as conferences and other gatherings, citing concerns about controlling potential outbreaks.

Gambia: airline restrictions
---------------
Gambia's Ministry of Transport said any planes flying to the capital, Banjul, should not pick up passengers at airports in Conakry [Guinea], Freetown [Sierra Leone] or Monrovia [Liberia].

Liberia: demonstration (1)
-------------------
9 Aug 2014: In central Liberia on Saturday [9 Aug 2014], riot police raced to quell a demonstration by crowds who had blocked the country's busiest highway to protest the government's delay in collecting bodies of EVD victims. Several bodies had been lying by the roadside for 2 days in the town of Weala, about 50 miles (75 km) from the capital, Monrovia, residents said.

Liberia: demonstration (2)
-------------------
9 Aug 2014: Members of the Liberian Association of Metropolitan Atlanta (LAMA), a nonprofit representing Liberian citizens residing in Atlanta, are out in force [in front of Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia USA]. "We heard about KB and missionary NW and how they risked their lives to serve humanity and also us," says Leo Mulbah, president of LAMA. "On behalf of a very grateful nation and community, we came to say thank you to them. We don't have money to give them. We don't have anything to give them, but we can say thank you. Thanks to them, [Liberians] are getting the attention our downtrodden folks need, and for that, we tell their families we are in solidarity with them." The LAMA group has been holding frequent town hall meetings for their roughly 15 000 members to raise money to buy equipment that might help stop the spread of EVD in Liberia, where it has killed nearly 280 people and triggered a nationwide state of emergency.

Nigeria: burial restrictions
--------------------
10 Aug 2014: The newspaper Leadership reported Sunday [10 Aug 2014] that Nigerians would have to bury EVD victims in the communities where they die. So far, 2 people have died in Nigeria of EVD. ... "Henceforth, dead bodies will not be allowed to be transported from one part of the country to another," Dr. Khalliru Alhassan, the 2nd in command at the Health Ministry, said on Sat 9 Aug 2014 in Kano; 7 people are known to be infected in Nigeria, 6 cases remain unconfirmed; about 70 people remain under surveillance.

Saudi Arabia: suspected case tests negative
-----------------
A 40-year-old who died in Jeddah after returning from Sierra Leone did not have EVD, Saudi Arabia's Health Ministry announced on Saturday [9 Aug 2014]. According to officials, samples submitted to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a laboratory in Germany have come back negative for the Ebola virus.

Saudi Arabia: visas suspended
------------------
The Embassy of Saudi Arabia has suspended visas of 7200 pilgrims from 3 African countries -- Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia -- as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of the disease among the pilgrims during the forthcoming Haj season [1-6 Oct 2014]. Saudi Ambassador in Guinea Amjad Bedaiwi told local media that the Kingdom has put a condition that the suspension of visas will be reviewed only after WHO issues a clear cut statement that citizens in these countries are allowed to travel for Haj. Bedaiwi said the embassy extensively discussed the issue with the Guinean government, an Islamic state, where the number of its pilgrims comes to nearly 7000 as against 400 others from both Sierra Leone and Liberia.

China (Hong Kong): suspected case
------------------------
10 Aug 2014 : [A] 31-year-old Nigerian man suspected to have the ebolavirus was admitted to a Hong Kong hospital on Sunday [10 Aug 2014], the city's Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said. The Hong Kong centre is expected to announce test results in the next few hours.

The Nigerian arrived in Hong Kong from Nigeria on Thu [7 Aug 2014] and had been staying at a guest house in Chungking Mansions in Tsim Sha Tsui, according to reports in the Chinese-language press. He was sent to hospital this morning after experiencing diarrhoea, one of the fatal disease's early symptoms, hospital sources said. ... More than 10 000 travellers arrive in Hong Kong from the 4 countries every year. All would be placed under closer health surveillance upon arrival, and leaflets would be handed out at entry points. In the event of an ebolavirus case being identified, all those in close contact with the patient would be put in quarantine and banned from departing the city under the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance.

[It was probably just something he ate, but HK is right to take extreme precautions; 10 000 arrivals a year from those 4 countries is an average of almost 200 a week to be screened, a feasible number. - Mod.JW]

Spain: missionaries from Liberia
-----------------------------
10 Aug 2014: In Madrid, doctors will treat the priest MP -- infected in Liberia and the 1st known EVD carrier on European soil during the current outbreak -- with the experimental drug ZMapp, Spain's Health Ministry announced on Sunday [10 Aug 2014]. Doctors have determined that the 65-year-old Spanish nun JBB who worked at the same hospital as MP in Liberia, does not have EVD. The charity that MP and JBB worked for had petitioned Spain for permission to bring in 2 African missionaries who became infected with EVD while helping treat patients at the same hospital, but Spain turned the request down. One of those 2 missionaries, a Congolese nun, died of EVD on Saturday [9 Aug 2014], the charity announced.

[3] Australian advisory not to neglect more common illnesses

Date: 10 Aug 2014

Ebola Virus Fears in Australia May Lead Doctors to Wrongly Quarantine
Patients with Fevers
---------------------------------------
Australian hospitals were warned by leading experts in infectious diseases not to become overly concerned in detecting possible cases of the Ebola virus since it affects their ability to recognise other alarming but common diseases.

Since the start of the Ebola outbreak, health professionals have been on the lookout for signs and symptoms inpatients who came from West Africa. About 1,700 people are known to beinfected and the numbers continue to rise with no available cure or vaccine. The outbreak in West Africa is largest recorded, according to reports.

New South Wales department of health has issued information on the Ebola virus to state departments and clinicians. Ebola concerns have previously prompted Australia's national health department to issue information to doctors about the deadly haemorrhagic fever.

Professor Peter Collignon of infectious diseases at the Australian National University said the national government is only right to take the necessary precautions. However, he said fears of the virus may begin to overshadow reality since there are other patients who may be dying because they were not being treated as quickly.

Australia's heightened awareness of the Ebola virus may lead to cases of people with malaria returning from Africa may be wrongfully suspected of having Ebola. The patient might be subjected to quarantine while the correct treatment is delayed since Ebola is being ruled out.

The professor explained that doctors are "only human" and can become overly afraid. They may suspect an Ebola virus case too quickly. Collignon reminded health professionals that people with fevers do not necessarily have Ebola.

He recalled the same fears in 2003 when the SARS virus outbreak affected several countries.

He said even if a patient was infected with Ebola in Australia, the training in Australian hospitals would mean the virus cannot spread very far. The Ebola virus is not easy to spread in countries with strong healthcare facilities and hygiene practices. For a person to be infected, he or she must have direct contact with the virus in secretions, blood, organs and other bodily fluids of an Ebola patient.

[This is sound advice. The likelihood of more common and potentially rapidly lethal diseases such as malaria or bacterial meningitis in a traveler from Africa far exceeds that of an importation of hemorrhagic fever, an event which has been vanishingly rare. Fear of Ebola virus disease and reluctance to carry out routine laboratory testing from these patients is likely to adversely affect many with readily treatable and more common illnesses.

The "CNN effect" in the US, nearly continuous television coverage of the outbreak and the repatriation of two US healthcare workers, has led to strict isolation of patients who have merely transited an airport in Africa with essentially zero likelihood of EVD and even the quarantine of healthy returnees with no exposure to disease. - Mod.LM]
