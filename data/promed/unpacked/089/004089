India: Chikungunya scare in Orissa: 4 Die
-----------------------------------------------
On Sun 27 May 2007, panic gripped Kural village in Orissa's Nayagarh
district after 4 persons died from suspected chikungunya [fever] in
the past 4 days, a health official stated. The dead were among 642
persons affected by the disease in the village, nearly 120 km from Bhubaneswar.
The village is the biggest in Nayagarh district and has a population
of around 8000. "The disease [has] spread to other villagers due to
negligence on the part of health officials who didn't bother when the
1st case was reported," alleged Lokanath Sahu, Chairman of Odagaon block.
"Cases are increasing day by day. All the affected persons are
suffering from high fever and severe pain in limbs and joints," Bijay
Paikray, Sarpanch of Kural gram panchayat told IANS. "We were under
the impression that the disease will not lead to death. But we are
shocked by the incident (the death of the 4 persons). The problem of
lack of proper food and care is being faced by the affected," he added.
A team of specialists from Bhubaneswar visited the village Saturday
[26 May 2007]. "We have found _Aedes_ mosquitoes in the locality.
This mosquito is the carrier of the chikungunya and dengue viruses.
So from the symptoms of the disease, a possible outbreak of
chikungunya fever cannot be ruled out," B Nageswar Rao, chief of the
specialist team, told IANS.
"Orissa does not have adequate testing facilities. Serum has been
collected from 51 patients and sent to the National Institute of
Virology, Pune for tests," he added.
