At least 16 people, mostly children under the age of 5 have died in Far North Cameroon of a mysterious disease that affected a total of 54 people, sources said. The Disease Control and Epidemics Director (DLMEP) at the Ministry of Public Health, Dr. Etoundi Mballa said "We are dealing with a curious disease the symptoms of which suggest that it is atypical eruptive fever". He added: "Investigations are ongoing".

He said that officials of the Ministry of Public Health were of the view that the important was to know whether it is an infectious disease "and so far we know that is not something that contaminates." The fever which appeared in 6 health districts of Mayo-Tsanaga, in the Far North continues to claim victims.

Its frequent clinical manifestations are persistent fever, skin rashes, anemia, hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy.

[The etiology of this outbreak with a case fatality rate (CFR) of almost 30 percent is unclear. Bacterial diseases such as typhoid fever and leptospirosis might be considered but in general the CFR is quite high for those diseases. One of the viral hemorrhagic fevers could be considered by mosquito-borne viruses such as dengue. ProMED would appreciate more information about this outbreak from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.LL
