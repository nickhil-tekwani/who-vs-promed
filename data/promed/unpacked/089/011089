Nagana [African animal trypanosomiasis] is quickly spreading outside
the traditional known districts. The disease attacks cattle after
they have been bitten by carrier tsetse flies. At the moment, the
number of cases in Soroti and Teso in general have gone up, and there
is fear that if something is not done quickly, the disease may cut across Teso.

"At the peak of the war in Teso, cattle keepers fled to Busoga. Now
with the end of the war, they are returning with their animals, which
are infected," says Dr. Christopher Kyeswa, the programme development
officer for Send-a-Cow Uganda.

Kyeswa says while efforts to fight the disease have been bearing
fruit in the 7 high risk districts -- Iganga, Bugiri, Busia, Kamuli,
Mayuge, Manafwa and Tororo -- the disease has spread to other areas
like Acholi. "There is restocking in Acholi, and the uncontrolled
movement of cattle may increase cases there," Kyeswa says.

Cattle are also gotten from Southern Sudan and western Kenya into the
north and eastern parts of Uganda. Tsetse flies thrive on a
particular vegetation commonly known as akayukiyuki in Buganda and
Kapanga in Busoga region. It is planted by people for beautification
because of its flowers. "They grow it as a hedge around homesteads,"
says Kyeswa.

Concerted efforts under FITCA had helped reduce Nagana cases in the
high risk districts. However, there are fears of a new upsurge due to
the uncontrolled movement of cattle. For example in 2001, there were
421 cases reported, while only 48 cases were reported in 2008.

"Awareness outside the traditionally high risk districts should be
improved if the spread is to be stopped," Kyeswa says.

[Nagana is African animal trypanosomiasis, a disease of cattle caused
by _Trypanosoma congolense_, _Trypanosoma brucei brucei_ and
_Trypanosoma vivax_. Humans in Africa are affected by a similar
disease, often called sleeping sickness, caused by _T. brucei
rhodesiense_ and _T. brucei gambiense_. Both diseases are transmitted
by the tsetse flies of the _glossina_ species, and _T.vivax_ can be
also transmitted by tabanid biting flies.

Cattle can be reservoirs for human disease caused by _T. brucei
rhodesiense_, and _T. brucei gambiense_ can infect pigs, which can
also serve as reservoirs of zoonotic disease. The large number of
trypanosomes and their zoonotic potential can be complex and
confusing, but one thing is clear: this is a very important disease
in cattle and humans. An excellent summary of the disease by Corrie
Brown from the University of Georgia Veterinary College can be found
in USAHA's Grey Book (see
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/emergency_response/downloads/nahems/fad.pdf>).

The impact on human health is 2-fold, and such multiple impact
pathways are often discounted when research and program objectives
are set by development agencies or authorities. The direct impact of
trypanosomes is sometimes minimized, but the indirect impact on human
health through the effect nagana has on cattle is definitely
significant but often waved away by human health analysts and
development authorities. Nagana has a tremendous impact on lost
productivity of cattle, reducing milk and meat yields by 50 percent.
A 1999 book, Impacts of Trypanosomiasis on African Agriculture by
Brent Swallow and published by ILRI, introduces the topic this way:

Trypanosomiasis also affects where people live, the way they manage
their livestock and the number of animals that they keep. In the
tsetse-infested areas as a whole, trypanosomiasis reduces the offtake
of meat and milk by at least 50 percent. And by generally
constraining farmers from the overall benefits of livestock to
farming -- less efficient nutrient cycling, less access to animal
traction, lower income from milk and meat sales, less access to
liquid capital -- trypanosomiasis reduces yields, area cultivated,
and the efficiency of resource allocation. It is estimated that a 50
percent increase in the livestock population would increase the total
value of agricultural production by 10 percent.

Likewise, the historical impact of nagana and human trypanosomiasis
on denying large parts of Africa to settled agriculture is also
immeasurable but I guess the details of that is the subject of
another posting. - Mod.PC]
