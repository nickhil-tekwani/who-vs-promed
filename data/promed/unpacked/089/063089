On Sat 15 Nov 2014, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 3 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, including one death.

Details of the cases are as follows:

- A 54-year-old female from Shihezi City, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region who developed symptoms on 19 Oct 2014. The patient died on 1 Nov 2014. Exposure to live poultry is unknown.

- A 58-year-old female from Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province who developed symptoms on 24 Oct 2014. The patient was admitted to a hospital on 28 Oct 2014. She is now in critical condition. The patient has a history of exposure to a live poultry market.

- A 45-year-old female from Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province who developed symptoms on 3 Nov 2014. The patient was hospitalized on 5 Nov 2014. Her current condition is mild. The patient has a history of exposure to a live poultry market.

The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures: (1) Strengthen surveillance and situation analysis; (2) Reinforce case management and medical treatment; (3) Conduct risk communication with the public and release information.

WHO continues to closely monitor the H7N9 situation and conduct risk assessments. So far, the overall risk associated with the H7N9 virus has not changed.

WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and hygiene practices.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.

WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005) and continue national health preparedness actions.

[This is the WHO confirmation of the 3 cases previously reported by the relevant Chinese authorities. As commented previously, avian influenza A(H7N9) is a subtype of influenza virus that has been detected in birds in the past. This particular A(H7N9) virus had not previously been seen in either animals or people until it was found in March 2013 in China. However, since then, infections in both humans and birds have been observed. The disease is of concern because most patients have become severely ill. Most of the cases of human infection with this avian H7N9 virus have reported recent exposure to live poultry or potentially contaminated environments, especially markets where live birds have been sold. This virus does not appear to transmit easily from person to person, and sustained human-to-human transmission has not been reported. Reports of H7N9 avian influenza in humans began in February 2013. According to the CHP, to date [before the above cases], there have now been 448 cases in mainland China, 61 of them in Jiangsu province according to the Department of Health (although other sources give slightly different totals).

H7N9 avian influenza cases in humans remain sporadic and in general associated with poultry consumption and husbandry. Among actions being encouraged by DH are avoiding live-poultry markets and farms, thoroughly cooking eggs and poultry before eating them, washing hands often, and wearing a mask if respiratory symptoms develop.
