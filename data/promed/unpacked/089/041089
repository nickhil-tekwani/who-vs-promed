A 17-year-old has died of bird flu in Indonesia, the country's 6th fatality from the virus so far this year [2012]. Health ministry spokeswoman Murti Utami said Tuesday [27 Mar 2012] the boy from eastern Lombok island developed symptoms early this month [March 2012] after coming into contact with sick chickens. He died on 9 Mar 2012 after one week's hospitalisation. Ms. Utami says laboratory results came back several days ago confirming he had the deadly H5N1 virus.

Bird flu began ravaging poultry in 2003 and has killed 352 people worldwide. It is still present in some areas of Asia and the Middle East. Indonesia has been the hardest-hit country, accounting for 156 of the deaths.
