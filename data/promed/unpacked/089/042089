An outbreak of _Streptococcus equii zooepidemicus_ (strep zoo) reported in the 3rd quarter of 2022 in western Canada has demonstrated the value of African swine fever (ASF) rule-out testing. The Canada West Swine Health Intelligence Network's (CWSHIN) Swine Health Surveillance Report for the 3rd quarter of 2022 references a _S. zooepidemicus_ outbreak on a 5000 sow operation where 69 sows died over 7 days.

CWSHIN Manager Dr. Jette Christensen says because pigs on the farm responded well to antibiotics, the outbreak was not considered an ASF suspect case, but instead samples were submitted for ASF rule-out testing.

[Regarding _S. zooepidemicus_]: It's a very rare disease. It is very very severe. It causes sudden deaths in sows.

The additional problem is the signs are so severe they can mimic ASF, so the question was is this a suspect ASF case or is it something else. [So, it could also be said the 3 characteristics listed above could just as easily apply to African swine fever instead of _S. zooepidemicus_. - Mod.TG]

If it's an ASF suspect case, such a case needs to be reported to CFIA immediately and they will do a full investigation, but if it's not a suspect case, the other option is to make a rule-out test.

Because this case was likely a bacterial disease, as it responded to antibiotic treatments, they could say that this is not a suspect case but it should be tested for ASF just to be on the safe side, so they sent it for rule-out testing. It turned out, with the laboratory testing, it was not ASF but it was _S. zooepidemicus_.

Dr. Christensen says, when confronted with signs mimicking ASF, such as sudden death, internal bleeding and discoloring of the skin, to call your herd practitioner, who will investigate, submit samples and request an ASF rule-out test.

[Fascinating situation, as most people likely may not connect the clinical signs of African swine fever (ASF) with _S. zooepidemicus_. However, the consequences and the responses are quite different. While the clinical signs of both may include sudden death, differentiating them is very important.

ASF should trigger massive investigations as to how the disease got into the country and would result in a regulatory investigation. However, ASF does not usually respond to antibiotics.

Conversely, _S. zooepidemicus_ is not a common disease in swine, but when it occurs it is critical to rule out ASF, as the responses are very different. However, response to antibiotics is a good sign it is not ASF, but that may not always be the case. So please talk to your veterinarian and heed the advice to test and be sure.

ASF is a highly contagious and deadly viral disease affecting both domestic and feral swine of all ages. ASF is not a threat to human health and cannot be transmitted from pigs to humans. It is not a food safety issue.

_S. zooepidemicus_ may also cause infections in other domestic animals, such as cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, dogs, and cats. Diseases in your animals may have far reaching consequences, so please keep your veterinarian involved in the healthcare of your animals. - Mod.TG
