Wildlife experts are concerned about a rash of deer deaths just west
of the Hill Country. They seem to have identified the culprit.

Deer flourish in the Hill Country.

"They're not really a pest. They're not aggressive. They don't really
bother anybody," Oakridge resident Tom Hall said. From time to time,
nature thins the herd.

"You can see sometimes you'll come out, and there will be a dead deer
in your yard or something like that," Oakridge resident Jack Lacy said.

And now, a rash of deer deaths in west Central Texas has caught the
attention of wildlife experts. The cause could be epizootic
hemorrhagic disease. A biting fly is blamed for the outbreak.

Recent conditions could make the Hill Country a likely target this season.

"We're experiencing dry, drought conditions which reduces the quality
of the range or habitat for animals, so it makes them in less than
ideal health. That would make them more susceptible to natural
diseases," Kevin Schwausch with Texas Parks and Wildlife said.

Every year, officials expect to see at least some disease in the deer
population. Some years may be worse than others. Some of it has to do
with their close proximity to humans.

"When you have animals that are in high density or in close proximity
to one another, you have an increased opportunity for disease to be
spread from one animal to the next," Schwausch said.

Experts say there's no health threat to humans. Nonetheless, it is
natural to be cautious.

"Anytime you find an animal carcass or animal found dead, you want to
take precautions. Just not mess with them or handle the animal,
especially if you don't know why it died," Schwausch said.

High numbers of dead deer found by landowners in Schleicher and
Sutton counties have alerted Texas Cooperative Extension wildlife
experts about a possible outbreak of a viral disease.

''While some level of deer mortality is not newsworthy, it looks like
there could be a hotspot developing for epizootic hemorrhagic
disease,'' said Dr. Dale Rollins, Extension wildlife specialist at San Angelo.

''Epizootic hemorrhagic disease is a viral disease very similar to
bluetongue in sheep and cattle, but ... tends to be most common in
white-tailed deer.'' At the same time, he noted, deer dying from
epizootic hemorrhagic disease is expected, but it's impossible to
predict where deaths will happen from year to year.

''Hemorrhagic'' means to bleed; ''epizootic'' means an animal
epidemic. EHD is not contagious between animals or transferable to humans.

Dr. Don Davis, experiment station veterinary pathobiologist at
College Station, said bluetongue virus and epizootic hemorrhagic
disease are not a threat to public health, but since a definite
diagnosis is yet to be made, extreme caution should be used when
handling dead deer in the affected area.

Davis said the affected region encompasses an area roughly from Eden
westward to Ozona and northeast to Sterling City.

Corey Stevens, Schleicher County Extension agent, said he has seen a
lot of dead deer, primarily in July and August, but he attributes the
deaths to starvation because of the drought.

"The dead deer I've seen were real thin and appeared to be trying to
use all their strength to get to water,'' said Stevens, of Eldorado,
about 45 miles south of San Angelo. "When we see an abnormal number
of dead deer in August and September, and the mortalities are near
water holes, epizootic hemorrhagic disease is often the culprit," Rollins said.

Although Dr. William Edmiston's Eldorado veterinary office has
recorded no cases, Rollins said most of the calls he received came
from Schleicher County landowners who have found dead deer at water
sources, dirt tanks and livestock water troughs.

Davis said first-hand reports received from field sources indicate
bluetongue and/or epizootic hemorrhagic disease, which cause
hemorrhagic disease in white-tailed deer.

"Both diseases are viral in nature, and both are vectored or spread
by small biting flies called Culicoides," Davis said in a statement.
"Epizootic hemorrhagic disease is seen clinically only in
white-tailed deer, while bluetongue can affect other species,
including sheep and exotics. To my knowledge, only one necropsy by a
veterinarian has been made."

Signs, and particularly gross lesions, are consistent with both
diseases, Davis said after talking with wildlife biologists and
ranchers with experience or training who have observed the deer carcasses.

Anthrax was confirmed in several Val Verde County deer at mid-summer,
said Dr. Bob Hillman, state veterinarian and executive director for
Texas Animal Health Commission in Austin.

"A little rain, a lot of hot weather, and the invisible,
spore-forming bacteria _Bacillus anthracis_ resurfaced, putting
unvaccinated livestock and grazing wildlife at risk in the area," Hillman said.

An outbreak of anthrax occurred in Sutton County in 2005 for the
first time in more than 20 years, reducing the deer population on
ranches in the southwest corner of the county, said Pascual
Hernandez, Extension agent in Sonora, 65 miles south of San Angelo.

Hillman said proper precautions are to avoid touching or handling
sick or dead animals. When cooler weather and hunting season arrives,
anthrax cases will end.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease is common in white-tailed deer and
rarely affects other species. It occurs in the driest part of the
year when conditions are just right for biting gnats, the carriers of
the disease.
-The disease is not contagious from one animal to another, and it is
not transferable to humans. It comes from a virus carried by biting
gnats that live in or near water and wet, muddy areas. It is
transmitted to deer that congregate at such watering holes during
warm, dry weather.
- The spread of the disease is usually cut short with colder, wetter
weather that spreads deer out and away from gnat-infested areas, or
the first hard frost, which kills the disease-carrying gnats. Because
the incubation period for the disease is 5-10 days, afflicted deer
might be observed up to a couple of weeks after frost.
- Deer in the early stages of EHD might appear lethargic,
disoriented, lame or unresponsive to humans. As the disease
progresses, the deer might have bloody discharge from the nose,
lesions or sores on the mouth and swollen, blue tongues. They become
emaciated because they stop eating. Sometimes they even stop
drinking, although many die in or close to water.
- Domestic livestock could also be exposed, although cattle and sheep
are usually only carriers, not victims, of the ''bluetongue'' virus,
which is similar to EHD.
- Because deer-hunting season usually doesn't open until after the
first killing frost, deer hunters usually don't see live, infected
animals. Still, it is advisable to avoid shooting and consuming deer
that show any EHD symptoms, even though the disease cannot be
transmitted to humans.
