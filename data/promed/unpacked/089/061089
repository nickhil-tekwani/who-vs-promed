Information in the previous posting seems based on an incomplete
understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of EHV. The posting
states that 2 horses have been euthanized after testing. The number of
cases in which EHV is "deadly to horses" is in fact quite low, and a high
percentage of horses would be positive using standard serological tests.
Further details would be helpful, as it would be unnecessary to euthanize
on the basis of a positive test alone. Severe manifestations of
neurological disease would be a possible justification.

Infection with equine herpesvirus is very common in the equine population,
and most animals have neutralising antibody. Latent infection also occurs
in at least 70 percent of horses; recrudescence, shedding and repeated
infections during the horse's life are common. The precise reasons why the
nervous form of equine herpesvirus is so rare are not known, but may
include host and virus factors. Much current research is focused on
sequence differences between paralytic and non-paralytic viruses (contact
<nick.davis-poynter@aht.org.uk>). Older horses are more commonly affected
with the nervous form -- this has been related to the usual presence of
very high levels of circulating antibody and a circulating viraemia at the
onset of nervous disease.
