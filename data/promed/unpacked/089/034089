A Swedish man who died of parrot fever [psittacosis] in southern Sweden has transmitted the rare disease to at least 8 people, with experts pointing out that human-to-human transmission is exceptionally uncommon.

After a 75 year old man died in Kronoberg in March 2013 from parrot fever, the illness has spread among those who were near to him during his illness, including care personnel.

"This person was very sick and it was an extreme case. It's still hugely uncommon though, no one was infected 3rd hand from the secondary cases we had," Arne Runehagen, doctor at the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control (Smittskyddsinstitutet), told the TT [Tidningarnas Telegrambyra] news agency.

Human-to-human transmission of parrot fever [psittacosis] is exceptionally rare, with only one previous recorded case occurring, in Scotland. The disease is usually transmitted solely between birds. The illness gives pneumonia-like symptoms to human sufferers, and results in high fever, diarrhea, and severe headaches. The vast majority of the patients, however, survive the disease, and there are usually only 5 to 10 reported cases in Sweden each year.

Parrot fever [psittacosis] must be reported to the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control as well as to infectious disease specialists at local health authorities. The disease can be contracted after coming into contact with birds, their nests, or their droppings. The institute recommends that anyone coming into contact with birds or their droppings should wash their hands thoroughly. It is commonly spread by parrots, such as macaws, cockatiels and budgerigars, as well as pigeons, ducks, hens, and seagulls.

[It is unclear how much of this cluster was counted in the initial report of increased psittacosis in March 2013 (Psittacosis - Sweden: (SN, KR), alert, RFI 20130322.1599238). As stated, person-to-person transmission of this infection is quite uncommon but was reported in Tayside, Scotland and confirmed by PCR analysis (McGuigan CC, McIntyre PG, Templeton K. Psittacosis outbreak in Tayside, Scotland, December 2011-February 2012. Eurosurveillance 2012;17(22):pii=20186, http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20186). The transmission had been postulated previously but was confirmed in this Scottish cluster.

_Chlamydophila psittaci_ has been isolated from about 100 bird species, but most human _C. psittaci_ infections result from exposure to pet psittacine birds. Transmission has been documented from other birds, however, including doves, pigeons, birds of prey, and shore birds.

Psittacosis, also known as ornithosis or parrot fever, is a human disease caused by the bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. Classically associated with psittacine birds such as parakeets, parrots, and cockatiels, it may affect other avian species such as turkeys, ducks, pigeons, and pheasants. Human infection in general is caused by inhalation of dust containing the bacterium, which is shed in large amounts in the feces and secretions of the infected birds. Illegally imported decorative birds that have not been screened and/or treated can be a significant source of the pathogen.

The respiratory infection, usually diagnosed serologically, can be fatal if untreated. Although most diagnosed cases have direct exposure to birds, the infection may be acquired indirectly through the aerosolization of infective material in the grass or ground such as when mowing a lawn. Because of such outbreaks, protective equipment may be recommended for individuals in areas frequented by free-ranging birds, if contact with birds and their droppings is likely when performing outdoor activities such as lawn mowing. People who are occupationally exposed to psittacosis include pet store workers, poultry farmers, poultry processing workers, and veterinarians.

Historically
(http://animal-health.library4farming.org/Animal-Swine-Rabbits/DISEASES-AND-PARASITES-AFFECTING-poultry/Ornithosis-and-Psittacosis.html), the 1st description of a disease marked by an atypical pneumonia was reported in 1879 among persons having contact with sick parrots. A severe and sometimes fatal atypical pneumonia was observed in various European countries and the USA in later years. An unusually severe epidemic occurred in Paris in 1892. The name psittacosis was suggested for the disease in 1895. An epidemic involving more than 100 cases of atypical pneumonia, diagnosed as psittacosis, occurred in Argentina in 1929. A year later, outbreaks in Europe and the USA were traced to parrots newly imported from South America. - Mod.LL
