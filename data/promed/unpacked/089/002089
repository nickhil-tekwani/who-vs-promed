A team from the Agriculture and Irrigation Office in Sana'a Governorate, the General Administration of Animal Health at the Ministry of Agriculture and specialists from the FAO, today [18 Sep 2022] carried out a field visit to the Directorate of Al-Haima Al-Kharjiya as part of the emergency response to combat foot-and-mouth disease [FMD].

The Director of the Agriculture and Irrigation Office in the governorate, Engineer Ali Al-Qiri, explained that the field visit to a number of areas of the Directorate of Al-Haima Al-Kharjiya comes in response to a number of reports and complaints about the death of livestock and their infection with FMD.

He stated that the emergency response team, headed by the Director General of the Animal Health Department at the Ministry of Agriculture, Dr. Ahmed Al-Qadari, took samples from the affected livestock to be thoroughly examined to ascertain the nature of the disease they were exposed to, and work to provide the necessary treatments to combat this epidemic.

Al-Qiri indicated that the Agriculture Office will work within an emergency program in coordination with the concerned authorities to provide the necessary treatments for the affected livestock in the governorate.

[Official information about the FMD situation in Yemen is rather scarce. In fact, this is ProMED's 1st report on the issue since its inauguration in 1994; special thanks are due to the rapporteur. FMD data are also scarce from the neighboring Horn of Africa countries: Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Somalia.

In contrast with other countries in the Arab Peninsula, all of which are included in FAO's "FMD pool 3" (West Eurasia and Middle East; FMDV serotypes O, A, Asia 1), Yemen is included in "FMD Pool 4" (East Africa; FMDV serotypes O, A, SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3). According to the April-June quarterly report of EUFMD for 2022, this region underwent, during the months of April-June 2022, changes presenting increased risks from FMDV O EA.

According to the said quarterly, a batch of 48 samples were received on 18 May 2022 from Ethiopia, Yemen's neighbour within "FMD Pool 4", of which the results were "pending" (https://www.fao.org/3/cc1519en/cc1519en.pdf). Results from knowledgeable sources, as well as information on the species affected in Yemen (a photo included in the report presents a goat), from a knowledgeable source, will be appreciated. Hopefully, samples from Yemen have been shared with a reference laboratory.
