[1] North Korea: approach to outbreak

... North Korea experts said the nation is likely to continue abiding by its founding philosophy of self-reliance for now, but that its leader Kim Jong Un will have to make a crucial decision soon. After all, COVID-19 cases exploded following North Korea's massive military parade last month [April 2022], in which tens of thousands of young citizens attended from around the country. Earlier this week, Kim reprimanded a few officers for failing to deal with the initial phase of the outbreak successfully and professionally.

... Given North Korea's current health situation in which a majority of the people suffer from malnutrition and with almost no vaccines, experts said the repercussions of not moving fast enough could take a dangerous toll on the regime.

"North Korea faces a surge in pandemic patient numbers, even after voluntarily going into strong isolation for the last 2 years," Cha [Dr. Jiho Cha, professor at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology's Moon Soul Graduate School of Future Strategy] told ABC News. "There's a high chance they won't be able to prevent the majority of its people from catching COVID-19, even if they force additional lockdowns."

[2] Significance of BA.5 variant
Date: 21 May 2022

https://www.tf1info.fr/sante/covid-pourquoi-le-sous-variant-ba-5-au-portugal-pourrait-etre-a-l-origine-d-une-reprise-epidemique-en-europe-2220496.html


Since [12 May 2022], the spread of the omicron BA.4 and BA.5 variant sublines has been under increased surveillance at the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). This agency led by the European Union even calls on states to remain vigilant in the face of possible signs of emergence.

There is no apparent indication for the time being about the increased severity of these 2 new versions of the virus. Therefore, their presence and their spread would likely signal a "significant increase in cases of COVID-19 in the EU", warns the ECDC. In "the weeks and months to come", the outlines of a 6th epidemic wave could even take shape. On the Old Continent, all eyes are currently on Portugal, a country where BA.5 is rapidly gaining ground.

While this mutation accounted for 37% of positive cases on [8 May 2022], the variant very quickly became dominant in the country, rising to 63.5% on [15 May 2022]. Last week, however, analysts thought that this strain would not be majority before [22 May 2022], thus illustrating the great contagiousness and capacity of propagation of BA.5.

The BA.4 and BA.5 mutations, detected for the 1st time in South Africa in January and February [2022], respectively, can easily override the immune protection induced by a previous infection and a complete vaccination regimen. Another black point concerning BA.5, is that this cousin of omicron is able to reinfect people infected with the virus in the previous months. Outside Portugal, the presence of the BA.4 and BA.5 variants remains relatively uncommon in Europe for the time being, but the authorities are already preparing to deal with an epidemic rebound, in France in particular.

Currently, BA.4 and BA.5 are only detected in 1.8% of samples screened for these mutations. A figure still extremely low, even if according to the risk analysis of Public Health France dated 18 May 2022, "the frequency of detection of mutations" BA.4 and BA.5, "[...] is increasing since mid-April [2022]. The omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sublines are now subject to increased surveillance in France.

These mutations, under the radar of the health authorities, are proving for the moment "without major epidemiological impact at this stage", says Public Health France, but caution remains in order. Since French vaccination coverage is not the same as in Portugal, it is difficult to know whether the effects of the BA.5 variant will be identical. The immune status of the population in the 2 countries is very different, with Portugal enjoying excellent vaccination coverage. In France on [19 May 2022], only 78.3% of people had a complete vaccination schedule, compared with 85.9% in Portugal.

Portuguese companies are worried about a future paralysis of economic activity, due to high absenteeism to be expected due to the multiplication of work stoppages. But for now, and a few weeks before the opening of the tourist season, the Portuguese government does not plan to tighten the screws on health restrictions.

[As of 12 May 2022, ECDC has reclassified omicron sub-lineages BA.4 and BA.5 from variants of interest to variants of concern.

BA.4 and BA.5 were first detected in South Africa in January and February 2022, respectively, and since then they have become the dominant variants there. Both lineages contain the amino-acid substitutions L452R, F486V, and R493Q in the spike receptor binding domain compared to BA.2. Preliminary studies suggest a significant change in antigenic properties of BA.4 and BA.5 compared to BA.1 and BA.2, especially compared to BA.1. In addition, there is an increasing trend in the variant proportions for BA.5 observed in Portugal in recent weeks, accompanied by an increase in COVID-19 case numbers and test positivity rate [ECDC Update as of 13 May 2022; https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-sars-cov-2-omicron-sub-lineages-ba4-and-ba5].

The Portuguese National Institute of Health estimated that BA.5 already accounted for approximately 37% of the positive cases as of 8 May 2022. The estimated daily growth advantage for BA.5 over BA.2 is 13%, which is similar to the 12% daily growth advantage previously reported by South Africa. Assuming such a growth rate, BA.5 will become the dominant variant in Portugal in the coming weeks.

The currently observed growth advantage for BA.4 and BA.5 is likely due to their ability to evade immune protection induced by prior infection and/or vaccination, particularly if this has waned over time. There is currently no indication of any change in severity for BA.4/BA.5 compared to previous omicron lineages. As VOCs, these variants need to be monitored continuously with a view to their potential impact on health systems as a whole. - Mod.UBA]

[In the past 24 hours, 10 countries -- USA (136 222), Taiwan (89 420), Japan (77 813), Spain (58 839), Australia (49 365), Germany (40 651), Italy (26 818), France (24 332), South Korea (23 442), and Brazil (10 187) -- all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 1808 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 18 May 2022 to late 19 May 2022).

A total of 30 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 16 of the 30 countries are from the European region, 5 are from the Americas region, 0 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 63.3%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 2.4%. Comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 26.9% increase in daily reported cases and a 3.3% increase in reported deaths. This shows an overall global trend of increasing cases and deaths.

Impression: Worldwide, over 0.62 million newly confirmed infections were reported in the past 24 hours. Cumulative totals exceeding 526.48 million cases and 6.29 million reported deaths have been reported. - Mod.UBA]
