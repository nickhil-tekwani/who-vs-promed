Horse owners are being warned to get their steeds vaccinated against West Nile Virus after a horse in Prince George [British Columbia] was diagnosed with the deadly disease.

Prince George veterinarian Christine Murdoch recently faxed vets in the region saying that antibodies to the virus had been found in a horse that hadn't been vaccinated against West Nile virus.

It's likely just a matter of time before the disease is found here; it crossed the Rocky Mountains and was found in Kamloops last year [2011] and now Prince George, said local vet Dr David Farkvam.

"The scary thing is it causes [death] and the horses that survive often have neurological conditions and have to be put to sleep," he said. Horses should be vaccinated for West Nile in the spring, he said.

Infected horses might walk oddly, walk in a circle, become wobbly on their back legs, and do abnormal things like head pressing, he said.

West Nile virus is carried by mosquitoes. If the mosquitoes are out this early in the year, then it may be a very long season for the vector transmitted diseases.

West Nile virus is generally regarded as being preventable through vaccination. The vaccination is usually combined with the equine encephalopathies (Eastern, Western, and possibly Venezuelan). The vaccine should be given at least twice in a 3-4 week period to ensure adequate protection.
