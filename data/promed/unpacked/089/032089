Contaminated feed caused BSE outbreak
-------------------------------------
The outbreak of mad cow disease in Japan was probably caused by
contamination during the feed production process, a farm ministry panel
investigating the issue said Wed 27 Aug 2003.
The panel will finalize its findings during a meeting Thursday, after which
the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry will move to map out
measures to prevent a recurrence, according to ministry officials.
Japan's first case of mad cow disease, formally known as bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, was confirmed in September 2001. 7 Holsteins had been
confirmed as infected with the brain-wasting illness as of 31 Jan 2003, and
the farm ministry had been investigating the various elements that those
cows had in common, including the feed they were given.
Except for one cow born in December 1995, all infected bovines were born in
the spring of 1996. The proximity of the animals' birthdays led to
speculation that contaminated feed entered Japan during a specific time frame.
As a result of the panel's investigations, it was learned that a total of 5
feed production plants in Hokkaido, Gunma, and Ibaraki prefectures had been
manufacturing feed for cows and other animals, including pigs and chickens,
on the same production line without sufficient cleansing between production
runs.
Although meat-and-bone meal [MBM] had not been used in the production of
cattle feed, it was an ingredient in pig and chicken feed at those plants,
according to the panel's findings. MBM is made from slaughtered animals and
is seen as an infection route for BSE.
The panel determined that abnormal prions -- protein particles suspected of
transmitting BSE -- were in the MBM at some point, and this tainted feed
got mixed into the feed for cows. However, the panel was unable to confirm
where the tainted MBM originated.
Powdered animal-based oils imported from the Netherlands were used in
producing substitute milk that was given to the 7 cows, but the panel said
it doubts they were the cause of the BSE outbreak. The imported oils were
virtually free of such impurities as proteins, and there were no cases in
the Netherlands of BSE contamination through substitute milk, it said.
BSE was first confirmed in Britain in 1986. It is believed to be caused by
the consumption of MBM contaminated with abnormal prions.
Humans who have consumed tainted beef have developed variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Britain imposed a complete ban on the use of MBM
for cattle feed in 1996. The Japanese government did not impose a similar
ban until October 2001, following the discovery of the first BSE-infected
cow in Japan.
Beef sales and consumption dropped drastically as a result of the mad cow
outbreak, prompting the government to introduce stringent inspections of
all cow carcasses brought to slaughter that are destined for human consumption.

[Cross-contamination of cattle concentrates in Japanese feed plants may
have been a main cause of the dissemination of the causative agent. The
initial introduction of BSE into Japan might have been caused by imported
contaminated feed ingredients, most probably European MBMs, during the
1980s and early 1990s.
In January 2002, the Steering Scientific Committee of the EU published an
update of its opinion on the Geographical Risk of BSE (GBR). It indicated
that Japan posed a "likely" potential risk since 1990, i.e., about 2
incubation periods before the confirmation of the 1st case. A lower
("possible") risk could exist already one incubation period earlier, namely
1985-1989. See:
