Brazilian medical officials yesterday ruled out anthrax as the cause
of death of an Egyptian sailor, easing concerns about a merchant
vessel that had been quarantined off the Atlantic coast of Canada.
Officials in Brazil and Canada found no evidence of anthrax after
conducting a second examination of the man's body and doing tests on
the ship, although they still do not know what killed the sailor.
Ibrahim Saved Soliman Ibrahim was found dead in his cabin on the ship
11 Apr 2003, a few days after arriving in Brazil by plane from Cairo,
according to Brazilian police. A first autopsy of the man had turned
up an indication of anthrax, prompting speculation he was carrying
the substance to Canada, where his ship was headed after leaving
Brazil with a load of bauxite.
"What I can say is that it is not anthrax," said Claudio Guimaraes,
director of the Legal Medical Institute in the Amazon city of Belem.

Other information available to us at ProMED-mail indicated that the
initial IML diagnosis was based on an autopsy and histopathology
merely using a gram stain, not culture. Without a capsular stain,
there is a long list of rod-shaped gram positive organisms to choose
from.
Acapsular _Bacillus anthracis_ is not normally virulent, and
therefore the villain would have been one of the others, if he died
from an infection. Merely to tie up loose ends it would be
interesting to know, eventually, what this person actually died of. -
