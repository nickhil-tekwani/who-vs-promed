Humans
----------
In 2007, 6 cases were reported from 4 states: Amazonia, Para,
Roraima, and Goias. Simultaneous outbreaks in a humans and monkeys
were registered only in April 2007 in Goias state. [This was the only
report to come to the attention of ProMED-mail in 2007 -- see next
section, and comment at end. - Mod.JW]
Monkeys
-------
Until 1999, surveillance for yellow fever (YF) was done exclusively
for human cases. But in 1999, with the observation that in various
townships in Tocantins and Goias states, deaths of wild monkeys were
followed by the appearance of YF in the human population, such events
in monkeys were seen to be signals of YF risk to humans, and became notifiable.
In 2007, epizootics in monkeys were notified in 48 municipalities in
9 states: Goias, Tocantins, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso, South Mato
Grosso, South Rio Grande, Piaui, the Federal District, and North Rio Grande.
In Goias state, an epizootic of YF in monkeys was confirmed in a
small-holding in a suburban area of Aparecida de Goiania
municipality, and in a forest reserve in a residential condominium in
Goiania [capital of Goias state (see map and ProMED references
below). - Mod.JW]. As a result, more than 30 000 people have been
vaccinated against YF in Aparecida de Goiania, and in 2007, more than
1.5 million doses of the vaccine have been sent to the state. Control
of urban vector mosquitoes [_Aedes aegypti_. - Mod.JW] has been
stepped up. As a result, no human case of YF has been registered
[since April 2007] in either of those 2 areas of Goias.
Since 2003, the Ministry of Health has been vaccinating all residents
of states with areas at risk of sylvan YF (endemic, transition, and
of potential risk). People traveling to those states should be
vaccinated against YF at least 10 days before traveling there,
including tourists, ecotourists, and drivers who pass through such
states. In Brazil, vaccination is free and available nationwide at
the State Secretariats for Health and posts of Anvisa [National
Agency for Health Surveillance].

[The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Brazil showing the
location of Goias state and Goiania can be accessed at
<http://healthmap.org/promed?v=-10.8,-53.1,4>. - Mod.TY]
[The old International Health Regulations (1981 revision) required
countries to report any suspect case of YF in humans, monkeys, or
infected mosquitoes within 24 hours, to be followed as soon as
possible by confirmation or otherwise. According to the official
release above, in the case of monkey deaths this has been done by
Brazil since 1999. According to the above Ministry of Health
statement, the cases that occurred in 2007 were "not constituting a
public health emergency of international importance." However, the
Ministry recommends that, "People traveling to those states should be
vaccinated against YF, including tourists, ecotourists, and drivers
who pass through such states." It is important to note that
international tourists have died of YF in recent years (see
ProMED-mail references below for 1996, 1998, and 2002). - Mod.JW]
[The international risk comes in situations where YF virus infected
individuals with significant viremias end up in settings where (1)
there is an abundant _aedes aegypti_ vector population, and (2) where
the YF virus immunity of the human population is low. If the
Brazilian human YF herd immunity is high, then sporadic human and
monkey cases do not pose an international or even national epidemic
risk. That does not make the deaths of infected travelers any less
tragic. The above discussion raises the question: whose
responsibility is it to inform and advise travelers going into YF
endemic areas? The health authorities of the host country? Physicians
and other travel health advisors? International health agencies? The
individual traveler him or herself? All of these? - Mod.TY]
[At this juncture, it is important to emphasize that if tourists are
waiting for an official alert of YF activity in a known endemic zone
prior to getting vaccinated, they are running significant,
unnecessary risks. The importance of vaccination for all travelers to
known YF endemic areas cannot be overstated. A number of the YF cases
among tourists have occurred in areas that were known to be endemic
but where there were no known active YF cases in the primate
population or human population before the tourists became ill.
Perhaps travellers not relying upon an alert to trigger vaccination
but insistence on the general "get vaccinated before traveling to a
known endemic area" will work better. Information on YF risk zones
for travelers is available on the CDC (US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention) and WHO websites. Unfortunately there will always be
individuals convinced that they either "immune" or "exempt" from such
international health recommendations and may suffer the consequences
of such beliefs, and possible put others at risk resulting from their
behaviors -- in the case of YF, having an active case of YF returning
to an urban location where _Aedes agypti_ are resident (the vector
for urban YF), and potentially leading to an urban YF outbreak.
Perhaps the Bolivian government has the correct idea (see part 2
below). - Mod. MPP]

Traveler's Health Announcement [edited]
<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/contentBoliviaVaccineRequirments.aspx>

Effective 1 Dec 2007, the Bolivian Consulate General in the US has
advised that all persons older than 12 months traveling to Bolivia
must have a valid International Certificate of Vaccination or
Prophylaxis (ICVP) to ensure protection against yellow fever. If a
physician decides that for health reasons, a person cannot receive a
yellow fever vaccine, a medical waiver may be issued. A medical
waiver includes the completed medical waiver section of the ICVP and
a letter from the physician. The physician's letter must be
translated into Spanish. The traveler must submit both the ICVP and
the translation of the letter to the Bolivian Immigration
Authorities. This new vaccination requirement and other requirements
for obtaining a visa can be found on the Bolivian Consulate website
on the People's Diplomacy page [at
<http://www.bolivia-usa.org/consulares/consulares_VISA_english.htm>.]
On 30 Nov 2007, a Warden Message posted by the US Embassy in La Paz,
Bolivia, indicated that travelers who do not have a valid ICVP will
still be allowed to enter Bolivia if they are willing to sign an
affidavit exempting the Bolivian state from any liability in the
event the traveler gets sick with yellow fever within the Bolivian
territory. Travelers should note that not having a valid ICVP or
medical waiver may cause severe delays at the point of entry; to
ensure a quick transit, travelers are advised to have an ICVP or
medical waiver. This provision applies until further notice.
CDC is seeking further clarification of this policy. For questions
about these requirements, please contact the Bolivian Consulate in
Washington, DC or the US Embassy in Bolivia directly by using their
contact information at the links above.

medical waiver, see Yellow Fever (CDC Health Information for

[This is a good illustration of the kind of information that is
available to the potential traveler and to health advisors. This
again underscores the need for individuals traveling to endemic YF
areas to be vaccinated before their arrival.
