A child died from an "unknown disease" and around 40 people were affected in a span of 3 days in a small neighbourhood of Bandarban, said locals.

People have started falling ill in Puraton Lailiya Mro Para, a remote area in Lama upazila [sub district], since Friday [13 Mar], they said, adding that 1-year-old [child] died on that day.

His father said his other son, aged 3, is also in critical condition due to the same disease.

Almost half of the total of 82 people in the neighbourhood have been affected by the disease. All of them are illiterate, said one of the residents.

The nearby upazila health complex is 25 km [15.5 mi] from the area and there is no transport facility, which makes them reluctant to go to doctors to receive treatment, he said.

Affected persons' symptoms are high fever, cough, and rash all over the body, said Long Tung Mro Karbari, community leader of the area, adding that most victims are children aged between 3 months and 15 years.

"I cannot move as I feel pain in my whole body," a patient said.

Another resident said, "We all are in a panic as the situation is getting worse."

The community leader alleged that doctors or community health service providers never visit the area, which is out of vaccination coverage.

However, upazila health officer Dr Mahmudul Haque said they do so but not regularly, as the area is hard to reach.

Civil Surgeon Dr Aung Swi Prue Marma said, "We already sent a medical team to the affected area. Once they return, we will be able to tell the reason."

Lama Upazila Nirbahi Officer Nur-a-Jannat-Rumi told The Daily Star the team is monitoring the situation.

Mintu Kumar Sen, chairman of local union parishad [district council], said they have taken initiatives to raise awareness among the community about vaccination.

[Children between 3 months and 15 years old with a full-body rash and flu-like symptoms, including coughing and fever, may very likely have measles, especially in light of the lack of vaccination in the population.

According to the WHO, measles is the 5th leading cause of death among children under 5 years of age in Bangladesh. Annually, an estimated 20 000 children die from measles in the country which has a population of around 146 million. In response, the country has carried out a mass measles campaign, the largest in history. But according to this report, the area is so remote, it is hard to reach and community health service providers rarely if ever reach the area to administer vaccinations.

Since measles is so highly infectious, it spreads rapidly in a naive population such as this one. The basic reproduction number (R0) for measles is about 12-18, that is, each person with measles would, on average, infect 12-18 other people in a totally susceptible population.

ProMED welcomes any further information readers may have on these cases. - Mod.LK
