EU Audits ASF Controls in Poland, Latvia, Lithuania
---------------------------------------------------
Biosecurity measures in place in Poland, Latvia and Lithuania to keep African swine fever [ASF] out of their respective countries were generally approved by the Food and Veterinary Office [FVO], although it did find some deficiencies regarding feed and livestock vehicle controls.

The FVO carried out audits in Poland, Latvia and Lithuania in October 2013, with the aim to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the measures to prevent the introduction of ASF in each country.

In terms of scope, each audit focused on the cleaning and disinfection of livestock vehicles and the detection of consignments of products of animal origin imported in passengers' luggage for personal consumption.

After the confirmation of an outbreak of ASF in Belarus and Russia, the audit in Latvia focused on the operational criteria to implement the requirements of (i) Commission Implementing Decision 2013/426/EU in relation to cleaning and disinfection of livestock vehicles and (ii) Commission Regulation (EC) No 206/2009 in relation to the consignments of products of animal origin imported in passengers' luggage for personal consumption.

The competent authorities involved in planning and implementation of measures against ASF in Poland and Latvia have established means for cooperation and coordination within and between them. Resources are available for the controls, and planning takes into account the risk of introduction of the disease.

In Poland, FVO found there are no instructions for the officials.

The controls on the cleaning and disinfection of the livestock vehicles were generally carried out correctly for vehicles used to transport live animals in Poland and Latvia. However, in both countries, FVO found some weaknesses in the documentary checks relating to these vehicles and those transporting feed.

Controls on vehicles for live animals are implemented in Lithuania. Vehicles re-entering the Union after delivering feed to animal holdings are not subject to the required controls, contrary to the requirements of the Decision, because the officials at the borders cannot identify them.

Also in Lithuania, documentary checks were implemented as required but some declarations received with insufficient data to guarantee that the livestock vehicles had been satisfactorily disinfected were accepted. However, FVO found that the risk caused by inadequate drivers' declarations being accepted is mitigated by the routine disinfection of livestock vehicles.

Physical checks are also implemented as required. There are no facilities or provisions for cleaning of those vehicles at the Lithuanian borders, so vehicles without the adequate cleansing are refused from entering.

An additional safety measure has been put in place in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, by means of which when a livestock vehicle re-enters the Union, the border inspection post notifies this entry to the local veterinary unit and the vehicle is banned from visiting holdings for 48 hours.

Controls of passengers' luggage were carried out correctly and records are kept as required in Poland and Latvia. The decision to increase those controls to all luggage reduces the risk of the illegal introduction of products of animal origin in passengers' luggage, and therefore [reduces] the [risk of] introduction of ASF in this way.

The verification of the controls is currently based on direct supervision at the Border Inspection Posts. The effectiveness of this verification in Poland is reduced by the lack of instructions to implement the controls, according to FVO, so that corrective actions are not required when necessary. The audits in Latvia did not cover these controls.

In Lithuania, controls on personal luggage have been reinforced significantly since June 2013. Permission for passengers to return to their country with illegal products when detected reduces the effectiveness of the controls in deterring further attempts to illegally import products of animal origin.

The current system of verification of the controls on passengers' luggage has not included audits of such controls in Lithuania, according to FVO.

In its assessment of possible methods to control the spread of African swine fever [ASF] in Europe's wild boar population, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) finds hunting and artificial feeding unlikely to be effective, while it recommends a feasibility study on fencing.

EFSA prepared its scientific report in response to a request for urgent scientific and technical assistance under Art 31 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, in relation to possible mitigation measures to prevent introduction and spread of ASF virus (ASFV).

Specifically, it was requested to assess the feasibility to drastically reduce the wild boar population by hunting or by the use of traps, and to assess if prevention of movement of wild boars by feeding or by artificial physical barriers reduces the risk of spread of ASFV.

A review of the scientific literature on hunting and trapping of wild boar revealed that hunting and trapping has never achieved a drastic reduction in a wild boar population in Europe. Depopulation efforts can lead to adaptive behaviour of the hunted wild boar, compensatory growth of the population and the influx of wild boar from adjacent areas.

Introduction of ASFV through wild boar is a form of progressive spread of ASFV through the same wild boar meta-population, i.e. through direct or indirect contact transmission of ASFV between wild boar. Considering the above, drastic hunting is not a tool to reduce the risk for introduction and spread of ASFV in wild boar populations.

Furthermore, wild boar density thresholds for introduction, spread and persistence of ASFV in the wild boar populations are impossible to establish. This is due to the uncertainty on the extent of the spread and maintenance of ASFV in wild boar populations, the bias in population datasets and the complex population structures and dynamics. If depopulation attempts were to be undertaken, these can even increase transmission and facilitate progressive geographical spread of ASFV. It is well known that intensive hunting pressure on wild boar population leads to dispersal of groups and individuals.

Artificial feeding of wild boar might rather increase than reduce the risk of ASFV spread. Fencing can restrict wild boar movement but the practical feasibility of implementing (emergency) fencing in North East Europe is not clear at the moment. Better knowledge on the ASF epidemiologic situation and spatial distribution of the wild boars is required to identify the areas where fencing could be used as one element of a control programme and to assess the feasibility of its implementation.

ASF is a viral disease that is harmless to humans but deadly to pigs, and wild boar. At the end of January [2014], Poland and Lithuania reported cases of ASF in wild boar.

[Following the discovery of African swine fever (ASF) in wild boars in Lithuania during January 2014 and after neighbours banned pork imports from the Baltic EU state, Lithuania's Food and Veterinary Service made public plans of "a mass cull of wild boars due to an outbreak of African swine fever." As reported in 20140127.2236069, "The goal is to leave up to 10 percent of the current 60 000-strong (wild boar) population to prevent the virus from spreading." It will be interesting to note if the said plans are to be retained unchanged following the publication of EFSA's scientific report, the recommendations of which becoming issue for further discussion. The full report, titled "Evaluation of possible mitigation measures to prevent introduction and spread of African swine fever virus through wild boar," has been published in EFSA Journal 2014;12(3):3616 [23 pp.], available at http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/3616.htm. - Mod.AS]
