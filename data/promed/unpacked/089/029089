Influenza season has already hit northern Alaska, with cases confirmed for both the North Slope and Northwest Arctic.

"We have seen increased influenza activity in the northern region in the last month or so," said Donna Fearey, a nurse epidemiologist with the state of Alaska. "The way we learn about influenza activity is all flu reports are reportable [to the state], and, also, any reports of clusters of illness are reportable. So, if somebody calls and says there's a whole bunch of people with influenza [in an area], we will actually encourage testing and send supplies for testing. So, we actually outreached and worked to get additional specimens out of the northern region to see what was going on."

With more than 70 confirmed cases in September [2017], which was more than any other part of the state, the northern region was of interest to state health officials. The specimens out of the Arctic were sent to the state lab in Fairbanks for testing, where they were found to be just the seasonal strains of the flu and not anything unusual or unexpected.

The strains of flu found in the north were also confirmed to be the same ones for this year's [2017] flu vaccine, meaning the shot will work for the types commonly seen to date.

"For us, our messaging is that influenza season has started in Alaska, and in the north, it may have started a little earlier. The influenza vaccine for this season [2017-2018] is available, and we really encourage people who haven't yet been vaccinated this year [2017] to get vaccinated," said Fearey.

Flu season typically peaks during the winter months, she said, though there is often a wave of illness during the summer months, as well. Kids being back in school, and people spending more time indoors in close quarters because of the cold weather, can lead to spread of the illness at this time of year.

However, it's impossible to tell exactly when the annual peak season will be. In years past, the height of flu activity has been anywhere from the end of October to late spring. That's why it's important to get vaccinated as early as possible, Fearey said.

"Folks who are ill, we encourage them to stay home, cover your cough, wash your hands, because in addition to influenza in the winter months, we'll probably see a whole bunch more viral illnesses," she said.

The particular "recipe" for each year's flu vaccine is typically determined in the spring, she explained, based on early information about what strains of the illness are the most common. That information comes from data sent to the Centers for Disease Control by all of the states.

"The experts at CDC look at the most common strains that are circulating and make a decision of what components should be in the vaccine," she explained. It then takes about 6 months to mass-produce the vaccine and get it ready for distribution. It's usually available for people in late summer or early fall. Alaska has vaccines available now at hospitals and health clinics.

Even if someone got last year's [2016] shot, they'll still need to get the one specific to 2017, she said. "Influenza is constantly changing, and that's why we have to have a new vaccine each year," Fearey noted.

To stay healthy, people should remember to cough or sneeze into tissues or a sleeve and not their hands so germs aren't spread when they touch something else. Also, people with access to clean water should try to wash their hands frequently.

Keeping your hands away from your face can also help you stay healthy, as it will be less likely for germs on your hands to end up in your mouth, nose, or eyes.

"If they have an ill family member, and they're concerned, they should take them to the health aide and get evaluated," Fearey said. The best way of warding off the flu, though, is getting vaccinated early.

"For some people, at best, they're miserable and really sick for several days and maybe a week. For people who are medically fragile, it can cause severe illness, hospitalization, or death, so we really encourage people to take it seriously and get vaccinated," Fearey said. The flu shot is available for most people over the age of 6 months.

[According to the last biweekly WHO updates -- "In Europe and North America, little to no influenza activity was reported. RSV activity increased over the past few weeks in the United States of America (http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/latest_update_GIP_surveillance/en/) -- overall influenza activity has not picked up as yet in most of the Northern Hemisphere, but the increased number of cases detected in northern Alaska may be indicative of an early onset to the flu season. - Mod.UBA
