Health officials in San Mateo County say that while the cause of a
salmonella outbreak in the county in Jul 2005 remains under investigation,
almonds have been ruled out as the source. The outbreak, which was traced
back to La Tapatia restaurant in South San Francisco, affected 22 people
including 1 restaurant employee, according to San Mateo County Health
Services spokeswoman Beverly Thames.
In a communicable disease report issued to the Board of Supervisors, county
health officials initially leaned toward almonds as the cause, saying
specimens from the restaurant patrons matched a strain of salmonella found
in raw almonds.
However, Thames said on Wed, 24 Aug 2005, that it appears the salmonella
originated elsewhere. Testing to determine the source of the bacteria is
ongoing, she said.
Thames said that an environmental health specialist and public health nurse
visited the restaurant and recommended ways it can prevent future
transmission of harmful bacteria. "The public doesn't need to be
concerned," she said.
All of the people who contracted salmonella at the South San Francisco
restaurant have since recovered, Thames said.
