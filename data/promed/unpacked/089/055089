The Uruguayan government confirmed that the outbreak of brucellosis
was mistaken for foot-and-mouth disease [FMD].

The Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture, and Fisheries of Uruguay
confirmed today [7 Oct 2008] that the focus of infection detected in
the northwest of the country, near the border with Brazil, is
brucellosis and not foot-and-mouth disease as some official media reported.

Minister of Livestock, Ernesto Agazzi, said it will open an
investigation into the release issued Monday [6 Oct 2008] by the
veterinary authorities of his ministry in which he warned that there
could be an outbreak of FMD in the cattle population of Colonia de
Palma. This was denied later, after the relevant health analyses were received.

For his part, the director of Livestock Services, Francisco Muzio,
said that dissemination of this statement was "irresponsible" and
could have caused much harm to the export of Uruguayan beef.

According to the Ministry of Livestock the outbreak of brucellosis in
that locality of the Department of Artigas, located 40 kilometers (25
mi) from the border with Brazil had been reported days ago and
[measures were being taken to control it].

Currently, Uruguay is free from foot-and-mouth disease and statement
of an outbreak of the disease would impact very negatively on the
sales of beef abroad, one of the major items of export from this country.

[Brucellosis is an infectious disease of many ruminant species and of
swine. In ruminants, abortion is the most obvious manifestation.
Infections may also cause stillborn or weak calves, retained
placentas, and reduced milk yield. Usually, general health is not
impaired in uncomplicated abortions.

Seminal vesicles, ampullae, testicles, and epididymides may be
infected in bulls; therefore, organisms are present in the semen.
Agglutinins may be demonstrated in seminal plasma from infected
bulls. Testicular abscesses may occur. Longstanding infections may
result in arthritic joints in some cattle.

Given these as the most prominent clinical signs in cattle, it seems
a bit of a stretch to believe this was foot-and-mouth disease, whose
most prominent clinical include fever, sore feet, excessive
salivation, and vesicles in the mucous membrane areas to the point of
sloughing the epithelium on the tongue.

Announcements regarding an incorrect diagnosis or an unverified
diagnosis can cause much harm to the country's economy. We hope
Uruguay can resolve the issue quickly.
