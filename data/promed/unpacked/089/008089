Radio Marti reports that in recent weeks, dozens of people in several municipalities in the province of Matanzas have been admitted to health facilities or quarantined at home for diarrhea and other symptoms typical of cholera. Opponents and independent journalists quoted by the broadcaster said the outbreak is affecting at least 5 municipalities of the province: Cardenas, Union de Reyes, Jovellanos, Pedro Betancourt, and Marti. Independent journalist Oscar Sanchez Madan said 2 doctors, one them a gastroenterologist, who requested anonymity, confirmed some of the patients have cholera.

The doctors said they have been instructed not to inform the population and that the rest of the cases have diarrhea caused by other pathogens. The doctors work in Cardenas, where many people who work in the nearby tourist resort of Varadero live. According to Sanchez Madan, despite the secrecy with which the matter is being handled, sanitary measures that have already been seen in other parts of the country where cases of cholera have been detected, are being implemented in the city.

The delegate of the Patriotic Union of Cuba in Cardenas, Eduardo Marcos Pacheco Ortiz, described an atmosphere of nervousness among the people, who try not to eat anything on the street. He said that although local authorities refrain from mentioning cholera, everyone knows what it is because of the measures being implemented, such as urging people to wash their hands, dip their shoes in chlorinated water when entering public places, and enhance the repair of leaks in sewers. In several of the affected areas authorities have closed cafeterias and banned self-employed persons from selling refreshments.

Pacheco estimated at 30 the number of cases in Cardenas. An activist said in her Twitter account that about 33 people had been admitted to the local hospital. According to Pacheco, patients who arrive at the Julio Aristegui Villamil hospital in serious condition are hospitalized and the others are sent home and quarantined.

The wife of Juan Francisco Sigler Amaya, leader of the Alternative Action Movement, reported from Pedro Betancourt [municipality] that on Thu 4 Jul 2013, many people flocked to the local polyclinic with diarrhea.

Another member of Alternative Action Movement, said that last week the Community Services (including garbage collection) workers of Pedro Betancourt were transferred to Jovellanos, just 16 kilometers [10 mi] away, which was seen as an indication that the outbreak may have started earlier in the nearby locality.

Since the emergence of cholera in Manzanillo, Granma, in 2012, the disease has not been eradicated and cases have been reported in almost all provinces of the country.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dania Virgen Garcia for this report.

Cases and deaths from cholera continue to be reported by non-government sources. Most of the cases have appeared in the eastern provinces of Holguin, Guantanamo, and Granma, although some have occurred in the western capital of Havana. Granma province is the site of the original cluster of cases beginning in June 2012.

The provinces of Cuba can be seen at http://www.plazacuba.com/images/travel/cuba-provinces.gif. In May 2013, ProMED posted regarding cases of cholera in the more central Cienfuegos Province. As can be seen in the map, Matanzas Province lies to the west of Cienfuegos, between it and Havana. - Mod.LL
