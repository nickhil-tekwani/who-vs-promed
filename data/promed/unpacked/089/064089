Attenuated Smallpox Vaccine Development
---------------------------------------
An experimental smallpox inoculation may safely pre-vaccinate people in
case of biological attack and could also be used for those with damaged
immune systems who cannot use the current vaccine, U.S. researchers said on
Wed 10 Mar 2004. The experimental vaccine protected monkeys against a virus
related to smallpox without causing some of the dangerous side-effects of
the older vaccine, the researchers reported in 2 separate studies. This
might offer new hope for U.S. health officials who have been trying, with
only limited success, to vaccinate hundreds of thousands of health and
emergency workers in case of a smallpox attack.
"These findings are important to the search for a replacement vaccine for
people with health conditions that would prevent them from using the
current smallpox vaccine," Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a statement. The
current vaccine, Wyeth's Dryvax, uses a live virus called vaccinia virus
that is related to smallpox virus. It protects well against smallpox but
can cause severe side-effects and even kill some vulnerable people. The
vaccine was worth the risk when smallpox was a global threat. But smallpox
exists now only as a theoretical biological weapon, and researchers are
seeking a safer vaccine.
Modified vaccinia virus Anakara (MVA) is a much weakened version of the
vaccinia virus used to a limited degree before smallpox vaccination stopped
in the late 1970s. Teams of scientists at the NIAID, at the U.S. Army
Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, and colleagues tested
MVA in monkeys infected with monkeypox virus. This is the best experimental
model for human smallpox. MVA protected the monkeys and caused very few
side-effects, they report in this week's issue of the journal Nature [The
Abstract of this paper is reproduced below. - Mod.CP]. Monkeys that got MVA
first and then Dryvax also had fewer side-effects, they reported. "Because
an initial MVA injection may help lessen the side effects experienced from
Dryvax, MVA may serve as an important pre-vaccine for
large-scale vaccination efforts in the event of a bioterror threat
involving smallpox," Fauci said. This could be important for U.S.
government officials, who admit the smallpox vaccination effort is stalled.
Fewer than 40 000 health and emergency workers have volunteered for the
vaccine, although the goal was 500 000. Worries about side-effects and
compensation for lost time at work top their list of complaints. Of the 39
000 workers vaccinated, 48 have experienced side-effects, including 21 with
potentially dangerous side-effects such as heart inflammation and one with
the brain inflammation encephalitis.
"This study shows that the MVA vaccine holds great promise as an
alternative to the current vaccine," the NIAID's Dr. Bernie Moss, who led
the study, said in a statement. "Although MVA may not quite equal Dryvax in
its effectiveness, it did extraordinarily well, with all of the monkeys who
were vaccinated with MVA surviving a potentially lethal monkeypox infection
and, aside from a few minor lesions, showing no clinical signs of disease."
In addition, people with damaged immune systems, such a cancer patients,
those with the AIDS virus, or those being treated for autoimmune disease
cannot receive Dryvax because of their risk of serious side-effects.
The same team tested MVA on immune-compromised mice. Writing in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they said the nice
remained healthy even when given 1000 times the usual MVA dose.

Title: Immunogenicity of a highly attenuated MVA smallpox vaccine and
protection against monkeypox

of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health,

Abstract: "The potential use of smallpox as a biological weapon has led to
the production and stockpiling of smallpox vaccine and the immunization of
some healthcare workers. Another public health goal is the licensing of a
safer vaccine that could benefit the millions of people advised not to take
the current one because they or their contacts have increased
susceptibility to severe vaccine side effects. As vaccines can no longer be
tested for their ability to prevent smallpox, licensing will necessarily
include comparative immunogenicity and protection studies in non-human
primates. Here we compare the highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus
Ankara (MVA) with the licensed Dryvax vaccine in a monkey model. After 2
doses of MVA or one dose of MVA followed by Dryvax, antibody binding and
neutralizing titres and T-cell responses were equivalent or higher than
those induced by Dryvax alone. After challenge with monkeypox virus,
unimmunized animals developed more than 500 pustular skin lesions and
became gravely ill or died, whereas vaccinated animals were healthy and
asymptomatic, except for a small number of transient skin lesions in
animals immunized only with MVA." - Mod.CP]
