According to reports from the zoonoses section of the Ministry of
Health, during the past year [2006] there were 2264 incidents of
bites by domestic spiders (also known as _Loxosceles laeta_, but
better known as "violin spider" or "corner spider").
The specialist of the [zoonoses] section, Dr Ana Maria Navarro Vela,
indicated that among the country's departments [state or province
equivalents. - Mod.TY] Lima had a total of 375 cases, followed by
Arequipa with 338, La Libertad with 287, and Ica with 249 cases.
Some of these bites can produce serious intoxication, including
death, which was the case last year [2006] when 3 deaths from this
cause were registered.
When consulted about how and where a person might be bitten, Dr
Navarro said that these house spiders are found in quiet areas (such
as stored clothing and shoes) and in dark areas of the house. When
furniture is moved or clothing from these areas is put on, the person
is exposed to bites [by these spiders].
She added that this occurs with greatest frequency during the winter
or change of seasons when the people change their clothing. However,
she added that these spiders do not attack spontaneously, rather,
only when they feel attacked [or are pressed against the person's
skin. - Mod.TY].
The bites do not always manifest themselves as cutaneous lesions, but
there also can be visceral organ involvement with renal insufficiency
and red cell destruction, which can cause the death of the victim.

_Loxosceles laeta_ is the Chilean recluse spider, commonly know as
the violin, fiddleback, or corner spider. It is the most venomous of
the recluse spiders. Bites of these spiders can be minor, or cause
severe necrotizing ulcers that can take weeks to months to heal.
Death from renal failure may occur in 3-4 percent of cases. This
spider is related to the brown recluse spider found in North America.
