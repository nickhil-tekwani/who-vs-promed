Surge in rabies cases -- number may swell in monsoon
-----------------------------------------------------
With a rise in the dog bite cases in the city [Panchkula, Haryana state]
and its periphery, there has been a substantial increase in the number of
rabies patients in the recent past. According to sources, 5 to 6 rabies
patients visit the General Hospital, Sector 6, every day.

More than 100 cases of dog bites were reported at the hospital in May
[2010]. Come monsoon and the number may swell, say experts. Sources said
most of the patients came from rural areas, urban slums or the adjoining
towns such as Dhakoli, Zirakpur, and Baltana.

Dog or monkey bite cases were also reported from Madna, Morni, Berwala,
Nadda, Kalka, Raipur Rani, and Barwala. "Deforestation has forced monkeys
and other dangerous species to stray into these areas," said sources. A
monkey bite can also cause rabies -- a disease caused by [viruses
classified in the genus _Lyssavirus_], which has the tendency of hiding
itself from the immune system and not giving the body time to respond to
its attack. The immune system's inability to combat the virus allows it to
reach the central nervous system where it replicates quickly and spreads
all over the brain, causing inflammation and affecting its functioning.
Only a vaccine can prevent this from happening.

An affected person develops hydrophobia, becomes anxious, and hyperactive.
There is increasingly uncontrolled movement, confusion, and delirium. At
this stage, animals also go mad and bite.

Even though the municipal corporation has invited expression of interest
for vaccinating stray dogs in the district, which were estimated to be
about 5000 in number, people would have to suffer till a contract is
awarded to some organisation.

Confirming this, medical superintendent Dr VK Bansal said the hospital in
its stock had 589 [doses] of anti-rabies [vaccine] "Rabipur", of which
around 169 have been used for treating patients last month [May 2010].
[Rabipur is a cell culture-derived inactivated rabies virus (Fluty LEP
strain) vaccine. - Mod.CP] He said they were providing free treatment to
patients residing in urban slums and people belonging to below poverty line
(BPL). He said general patients were being charged Rs 100 [USD 2.15] per
injection. He added that depending upon the condition of patient 4 to 5
anti-rabies injections were given.

Dr Bansal said [the hospital clinic] anti-rabies injection was the cheapest
option, as chemists were selling these for Rs 350 [USD 7.5] or more. He
claimed that even the patients from Chandigarh were visiting the hospital
for treatment. He suggested that in case of monkey or a dog bite, a person
should immediately wash the wound with running water and detergent soap for
about 12 to 15 minutes. An antiseptic cream should be applied on the wound
and the victim should be rushed to a doctor for the administration of the
anti-rabies vaccine.
