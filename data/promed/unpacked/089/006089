Pink disease is ravaging citrus trees in the country. A citrus grower with 300 trees said if nothing is done about it, the disease will wipe out the citrus trees in the country. He said it is widespread in Eastern Highlands province and has been there for a long time, but no one has been doing anything about it. Citrus varieties such as mandarin, oranges, lemons, and lime are grown there. Many growers are neglecting their orchards because of diminishing returns and difficulties in management. The industry is now decimated by pink disease, and serious intervention is needed to save the trees from the devastating disease.

Although the Fresh Produce Development Agency (FPDA) may have some funds available for citrus, small growers to date have not received any word or support from them or any other key agencies within the agriculture sector. The Highlands Farmers Settlers Association said the disease raises a series of concerns that have not been addressed by relevant government agencies. FPDA or other relevant agencies have not commented so far.

[Pink disease of citrus is caused by the fungus _Necator salmonicolor_ (previously _Erythricium salmonicolor_). The pathogen also affects a range of other woody hosts, including tree crops (e.g., quince, custard apple, apple), but has also been found on herbaceous hosts such as capsicum. Several fungal groups have been identified in different locations and host species. Pathogen development is favoured by warm temperatures and high humidity, resulting in crop losses mainly for subtropical and tropical environments.

Symptoms on citrus may include wilting of twigs and leaves; die-back of branches; necrosis of leaves and bark; pinkish-white mycelium on affected branches; and longitudinal cracking and gumming on branches. Forest trees may serve as pathogen reservoirs for crops. Disease incidence is higher in densely planted groves due to increased air humidity. Spread can occur by air currents and with contaminated plant or other materials. Disease management may include plant hygiene measures (e.g., removal and burning of infected wood) and fungicide (e.g., copper) sprays.
