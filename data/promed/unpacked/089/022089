Herpes feared in 7 horse deaths
-------------------------------
Seven standardbred horses are dead and 220 more in this region are being
treated in a suspected outbreak of the equine herpesvirus following a sale
in London [Ontario]. Five of the dead horses, purchased for harness racing,
were sold at the Forest City Yearling Sale in London 3 weeks ago. The other
2 were in contact with the ill horses.
"It's serious," said Scott Weese, a clinician in infection control at the
Ontario Veterinary College in Guelph. "A few deaths came in around the same
time flagged it that we had to start investigating." Weese cautioned while
the herpes virus is suspected in all 7 deaths, it has been confirmed in
only 3. "We don't know if we're in a major outbreak in the grand scheme of
things," he said.
The Ilderton Equine Clinic has treated 220 horses and veterinarian Stan
Henderson said there's a lot of concern in the horse community. "This is an
especially serious form of this virus and where did it come from? I'm
trying to track down most of these horses that have been sold."
Signs of equine herpes include fever, difficulty breathing, coughing,
stumbling, and lack of appetite. There may be signs of impaired nervous
function. "The prognosis is good for the majority of horses with herpes,"
Weese said. "Most horses exposed to the virus . . . will get the very mild
disease." But herpes can cause pregnant mares to lose their unborn foals,
Henderson warned. "If it gets into a band of brood mares, it can have
really serious economic consequences."
Saying the herpes virus is more serious than West Nile, which killed 9
horses in Oxford and Brant counties in September, Henderson is urging horse
owners to have their animals vaccinated [against equine herpes]. But during
an outbreak, it's not advised [to vaccine against equine herpes] because it
can make a sick horse worse, he added. Henderson said owners should monitor
their horses' temperatures, keep the animals' stress level down and give
them lots of rest and fluids. "Stressful situations in a horse's life can
make the virus become a clinical situation." Weese said putting a recently
purchased horse in quarantine is also a good idea.
The Animal Health Laboratory at the University of Guelph said thoroughbreds
-- pure breeds -- also have contracted herpes in the suspected outbreak.

[Equine herpesvirus-1 can cause 3 different forms of disease:
rhinopneumonitis, a respiratory disease of mostly young horses; abortions
in pregnant mares; and a neurologic disease. There are at least 7 other
strains of equine herpesviruses, named in order of their discovery. - Mod.TG]
