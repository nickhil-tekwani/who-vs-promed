Kansas State University faculty has confirmed a case of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ in northeast Kansas. The affected patient [an animal - Mod.TG] showed signs of lethargy, decreased appetite, and pain before evaluation at Kansas State University Veterinary Health Center. CT [computerized tomography] scan showed generalized lymphadenopathy and a hypo-attenuating liver. Complete blood count revealed an inflammatory leukogram and mild normocytic, normochromic anemia with evidence of many trypomastigote organisms (Image 1) and a focal area of moderate amastigotes (Image 2) [see source URL above for images].

PCR testing confirmed _T. cruzi_, genotype 1. Full necropsy showed generalized parasitism (Images 3 and 4 depict the organism in skeletal muscle).

_T. cruzi_ is a protozoal parasite known to infect dogs, humans, and other mammals, resulting in Chagas disease. _T. cruzi_ is spread through the bite of its insect vector, the kissing (triatomine) bug (Image 5).

Dogs consuming kissing bugs may also become infected. The parasite may be spread congenitally or through blood transfusion or organ transplantation. Chagas disease is endemic in South and Central America and is becoming more prevalent in the southern United States, particularly in states bordering Mexico.

Chagas disease was last reported in Kansas in 2014. The acute phase of infection is associated with flulike symptoms, whereas the chronic phase can culminate in heart failure. Unfortunately, treatment options are not readily available, and no vaccination exists for this disease.

Treating the environment for insects is recommended to decrease exposure to kissing bugs, and thus _T. cruzi_. If you are concerned you have identified a kissing bug, you may reference <kissingbug@tamu.edu> or contact KSVDL Client Care at <clientcare@vet.k-state.edu> or 785-532-5650.

[This article mentions dogs, but the species of the nonhuman animal "patient" within the report is not specified. Generally, this disease is found more in the Southern region of the US. However, travel, weather, and a host of other conditions may facilitate movement of the insect vector, or the animal may have traveled or lived in a region where the vector is more common.

Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, is a zoonotic vector-borne disease transmitted by triatomine bugs and caused by the protozoan parasite _Trypanosoma cruzi_; it causes potentially life-threatening disease of the heart and gastrointestinal tract. All mammals are considered susceptible to infection, with infection demonstrated in more than 100 mammalian species. Avian species are not susceptible. The disease is best recognized in dogs and people, with dogs serving as a major domestic reservoir. Domestic pigs and cats can also be infected, but their role as reservoirs for human infection is limited. Wildlife reservoirs include opossums, armadillos, raccoons, woodrats, and nonhuman primates (https://www.merckvetmanual.com/circulatory-system/blood-parasites/trypanosomiasis).

The southern half of the US contains enzootic cycles of _T. cruzi_, involving 11 recognized triatomine vector species. The greatest vector diversity and density occur in the western US, where woodrats are the most common reservoir; other rodents, raccoons, skunks, and coyotes are also infected with _T. cruzi_. In the eastern US, the prevalence of _T. cruzi_ is highest in raccoons, opossums, armadillos, and skunks. A total of 7 autochthonous vector-borne human infections have been reported in Texas, California, Tennessee, and Louisiana; many others are thought to go unrecognized. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3194829/).

In the US, dogs, opossums, and armadillos are most likely to carry the protozoan that causes Chagas disease. Many other animals can serve as carriers (or reservoirs), including cats, rabbits, raccoons, and rodents. Generally, dogs are the only animals that show signs of disease.

Animals can get Chagas disease by living or sleeping outside in an area where the "kissing bug" (vector) lives. This bug lives in cracks and holes of old unkempt buildings or homes, as well as in wooded areas, and can be found in Latin America and as far north as Virginia in the US. The protozoa develop in the intestine of the kissing bug. This bug is a blood feeder and will bite its host (animal or human), then excrete feces after feeding. This fecal material contains the protozoa, which then enter the bite wound created by the kissing bug.

In dogs, the most common signs of infection are fever, sluggishness, and an unkempt hair-coat. Signs of heart failure may show up after an extended period. Other animals do not typically show any signs of illness (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/FastFacts/pdfs/chagas_F.pdf).

"[Chagas] disease is divided into acute and chronic phases, with the chronic phase further subdivided into latent and symptomatic chronic disease. Incubation ranges from 5-42 days before acute disease. Acute infections may be asymptomatic or consist of nonspecific febrile illness with a chancre at the site of parasitic entry. Dogs may also present with regional or generalized lymphadenopathy, anorexia, lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, and hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Rarely, acute clinical myocarditis is seen. Parasitemia peaks 2-3 weeks after infection and dissipates after the 1st month as the organism moves to predominantly tissue-borne disease.

"The latent phase can last for months to years. Chronic disease symptoms can include generalized weakness or sudden death. Symptomatic dogs commonly present with right-side congestive heart failure. This can progress to myocarditis, with arrhythmias and bilateral cardiac dilation. Histologic examination of cardiac muscle may contain unruptured pseudocysts without inflammation or contain ruptured pseudocysts with lymphocytic, monocytic, and/or neutrophilic inflammation. Death secondary to heart failure is common.

"Benznidazole is the drug of choice for treatment, but nifurtimox can also be used. In dogs, benznidazole is administered at 5-10 mg/kg/day, PO, for 2 months. In the USA, both of these drugs lack FDA approval, and their use requires permission from the CDC as investigational protocols. Symptomatic treatment for heart failure and arrhythmias is also recommended" (https://www.merckvetmanual.com/circulatory-system/blood-parasites/trypanosomiasis).

Sadly, there is no vaccine against this disease. - Mod.TG]

[The illness as described suggests an acute _T. cruzi_ infection. Many animals can be infected with varying degrees of natural immunity (resistance to clinical illness). The infection could happen through 2 routes: either the animal was eating infected triatomic bugs or the animal was given infected fruits to eat (fruits imported from Central or South America). The 1st option implies that _T. cruzi_-infected triatomic bugs are present in Kansas. If the animal was fed fruits imported from Central or South America, these could have been contaminated with _T. cruzi_. This is well documented for human infections: The outbreak in St. Catherina, Brazil, was caused by contaminated sugar cane, and the large outbreak in Caracas, Venezuela, was the result of contaminated guava juice.

ProMED-mail will be happy to post further information. - Mod.EP]

[Information on the species of animal involved and possible high-risk exposures (travel to known regions of high endemicity or exposure to food products from known highly endemic regions) would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP
