A virus killing Atlantic salmon but harmless to people is spreading in fish
farms in eastern Maine, forcing the destruction of hundreds of thousands of
valuable fish and threatening endangered wild salmon, state and federal
officials say.
The disease was first detected in the 1980's in Norwegian and Scottish fish
farms, then appeared in New Brunswick fish pens in 1996, and crossed the
border into Cobscook Bay in Maine in March.
The discovery in recent days of several more infected fish in pens in the
bay prompted state officials to impose emergency rules barring boats from
leaving infected areas and requiring fish farmers to notify officials
immediately when an infected fish was found. Infected fish and fish exposed
to them must be removed and killed, although some may still be sent to market.
The highly contagious disease, infectious salmon anemia (ISA), affects a
fish's kidneys and circulatory system. It causes the fish to bleed
internally and usually die. Much remains unknown about how the virus
spreads, although it is known to move in the water and from fish to fish in
crowded pens. Juvenile and adult fish are affected.
The anemia has forced the destruction of millions of fish in Europe and
Canada in recent years as fish farmers on both sides of the Atlantic have
tried to contain its spread. Maine fish farmers have killed more than 900
000 fish since March, state officials said.
Several fisheries experts said that in the countries where the disease was
most established, close surveillance had prevented large outbreaks. They
said it was likely to be kept at bay in Maine as well.
Fish having reached their adult size of 8 to 10 pounds can still be sold,
cutting the financial losses somewhat. So far, state and industry officials
said they had not been able to estimate the economic cost of fighting the
virus. The state's fish farmers plan to seek aid from a Department of
Agriculture program that compensates farmers for herds of livestock lost to
illness.
Biologists said it remained unclear whether the virus was accidentally
imported to North America from Europe or had always existed in the wild on
both sides of the Atlantic but had remained unnoticed, with widely
dispersed wild fish dying and disappearing unseen. Several experts said it
could be that the disease had only come to light with the recent burgeoning
of salmon aquaculture, which packs thousands of fish into floating cages.
Increasing attention has been focused on the problem in recent months
because of the threat the virus poses not only to the growing aquaculture
industry but also to the already imperiled stocks of wild Atlantic salmon.
Strains of native salmon breeding in 8 of Maine's rivers were given
endangered status by federal wildlife agencies last November.
Some scientists said the large populations in fish farms could serve as
breeding grounds for the virus, and occasional escapees from the floating
cages could spread it.
But other experts said it was unlikely that the virus would have a
significant impact outside the dense collections of raised fish, though
many said it was better to err on the side of caution by aggressively
culling fish when there was an outbreak.
Many private environmental groups have criticized the nascent aquaculture
industry as playing down the risk of disease and pollution from the moored
pens, where the fish are fed for a year or 2 until they reach market size.
"Density creates an environment in which a virus that might be very random
and rare in the wild can concentrate," said Peter Shelley, the vice
president of the Conservation Law Foundation in Boston. Mr. Shelley said
the industry in Maine had been in denial for years about diseases in farmed
fish.
