Fiji: Suspected Dengue Fever Outbreak in the Capital
--------------------------------------------------
Doctors at the Colonial War Memorial (CWH) Hospital and Suva's Private
Hospital yesterday said people are coming in big numbers with fever,
diarrhoea, joint pain, and vomiting -- symptoms of dengue fever. The
Private Hospital is recording 5 such cases daily, while the cases range
from 10 to 15 at the CWM Hospital and at Lautoka Hospital.
However, doctors say people could also be suffering from [another] viral
infection. Dr Wahid Khan, a private practitioner in Suva, said it would be
wise for patients to go through blood tests to [identify] the infection
they are carrying. He said it is important to know if they are carrying
dengue virus or another virus. Dr Khan said dengue fever should not be
taken lightly and people should take measures to prevent it.
"They should kill mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are causing a number of
infections; dengue fever and filariasis are just 2 of them. They need to be
controlled," he said. "People also need to drink a lot of water and live in
clean, healthy surroundings."

[A previous report from Fiji on 4 Dec 2002, stated that 4 people admitted
to hospital in the Western part of Fiji had been diagnosed with confirmed
cases of dengue fever. There seems to be uncertainty about the diagnosis in
the capital. - Mod.CP]
