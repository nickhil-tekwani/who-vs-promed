The [US Food and Drug Administration] FDA has received more than 325 consumer complaints of illnesses associated with Daily Harvest brand frozen French Lentil + Leek Crumbles. The 329 reports are up from the 277 reported by the FDA on 14 Jul 2022, according to an outbreak update from the agency. When the FDA first reported the situation on 28 Jun 2022 it had received 277 complaints.

The FDA's investigation into the situation is ongoing. Anyone who believes they have become ill because of consuming the crumbles should contact the FDA at https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigation-adverse-event-reports-french-lentil-leek-crumbles-june-2022.

Daily Harvest officials were aware of illness reports before the FDA and on 17 Jun 2022 initiated a recall of its Lentil & Leek Crumbles. All lot codes of the French Lentil + Leek Crumbles are affected. The product was distributed nationwide and in 2 retail locations; the Daily Harvest store in Chicago, Illinois, and a "pop-up" store in Los Angeles, California.

The company reports having received 470 consumer complaints of illnesses. Sicknesses have involved relatively minor symptoms to severe situations involving liver failure. The FDA reports that 113 patients have been hospitalized. At least 25 of the patients have had to have their gallbladders removed. The last illness onset was 16 Jul 2022.

Symptoms have included yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, itching with no rash, gastrointestinal illness, nausea, fatigue, body aches, severe abdominal pain, and/or fever after consuming this product.

The FDA advises anyone who has eaten the Daily Harvest product and developed symptoms to please consult with a healthcare provider and let them know you have recently consumed the recalled Daily Harvest French Lentil + Leek Crumbles. Healthcare providers should report these illnesses to their health department.

Since the recall, the company has announced that there may be a link to the illnesses from tara flour used in the crumbles. The company owner says no other Daily Harvest products have tara flour as an ingredient.

Daily Harvest CEO Rachel Drori admits her company has identified tara flour as the cause of more than 470 reported illnesses. Tara flour comes from the seeds of tara trees which are native to Peru. Tara flour is one of more than a dozen ingredients listed in Daily Harvest's recalled French Lentil + Leek Crumbles.

As of 14 Jul 2022 the Food and Drug Administration is reporting 277 reports from people who ate the frozen crumbles. Consumer Reports (CR) is the latest voice to advise people to not eat the product and to check their freezers for it.

Here are the highlights of the CR warning:
- "Because the reported symptoms have been so severe and so little is known, we're advising people to avoid tara flour until we understand what is causing the illnesses, and until consumers can be assured any products containing tara flour in the wider market are safe," says James E Rogers, PhD, director of food safety and testing at Consumer Reports.
- Last month [July 2022], Daily Harvest and the FDA announced a voluntary nationwide recall of 28 000 units of French Lentil + Leek Crumbles after multiple reports surfaced of people becoming ill after eating it.
- Daily Harvest claimed earlier this week tara flour was only used in their French Lentil + Leek Crumbles product -- not in any of their other 140 or so food items.
- A Daily Harvest spokesperson said, "Our investigation team will continue working with the FDA, the tara flour producer, and others to help determine what specifically made people sick.

Until more information is made available to the public, Consumer Reports' food safety and policy experts recommend that consumers stop eating products containing the additive called tara flour. This advice comes after a popular plant-based meal delivery service, Daily Harvest, named tara flour as the culprit behind a recent outbreak of illness related to its French Lentil + Leek Crumbles frozen product. The recalled product is known to have sickened almost 500 people so far.

Neither Daily Harvest nor the Food and Drug Administration has provided additional details about what specifically in the tara flour used in the French Lentil + Leek Crumbles made people ill. In some cases, consumers were reportedly so sick with fever, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, and high liver enzyme levels that they had to seek emergency care. At least 25 people are known to have had their gallbladder removed.

"Because the reported symptoms have been so severe and so little is known, we're advising people to avoid tara flour until we understand what is causing the illnesses, and until consumers can be assured any products containing tara flour in the wider market are safe," says James E Rogers, director of food safety and testing at Consumer Reports.

A spokesperson for the FDA confirmed the agency is working with Daily Harvest in an ongoing investigation involving "extensive testing for numerous possible adulterants, including microbial and chemical contaminants." They also noted this process "takes time, and there are no guarantees the information available to the agency will demonstrate a definitive link between illnesses and foods."

The company said earlier this week tara flour was used only in its French Lentil + Leek Crumbles product -- not in any of its other 140 or so food items. "Our investigation team will continue working with the FDA, the tara flour producer, and others to help determine what specifically made people sick," says a Daily Harvest spokesperson.

The product was distributed to consumers via online sales and home delivery and in retail locations in Chicago and Los Angeles. Daily Harvest ships its frozen, organic, premade food items to select ZIP codes around the US. The French Lentil + Leek Crumbles was first made available this past April [2022] as a food to saut√© and add to other dishes or products, the company said.

What is tara flour?
Tara flour is derived from seeds of the tara tree, common to South America. The seeds are harvested by hand, according to US-based company Westec, which sells tara products and has a page on its website exclusively promoting them. (The company did not respond to questions about whether it is Daily Harvest's supplier or whether it does any testing of its tara products.) A Daily Harvest customer service representative said tara flour has been used in North America for over a year as a plant-based source of protein.

"Tara flour doesn't appear to be commonly found in food products," says Amy Keating, CR's food test program leader. She says tara gum, a different ingredient made from the same plant, is more commonly used as a thickener or stabilizer in foods like ice cream.

Does the FDA regulate tara flour?
Tara flour is considered a food additive -- a substance added to food to flavor or preserve it, or to add nutritional properties, says CR's Keating.

The FDA does have a formal approval process to review food additives. In addition, there's a pathway known as GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe), which is essentially a voluntary industry repository of food additives considered to be safe, and the reason they are considered safe when used as intended.

Outside experts that CR consulted were unable to locate tara flour listed as a food additive at the FDA. "I can find no evidence that FDA ever reviewed tara flour for safety," says Tom Neltner, senior director for safer chemicals at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund. For consumers to have confidence that the food supply is safe, says Neltner, they need to know the FDA is watching over it.

What's more, not a lot is known about the additive. "This substance hasn't been in the US food supply for long," says Michael Hansen, CR's senior scientist for food policy. "There are gaps in the system allowing new additives to enter the market without going through any process. Unfortunately, that's what may have happened here."

CR asked the FDA whether tara flour is an approved ingredient for use in food, or whether it's listed as a GRAS ingredient, and whether it has undergone any FDA safety testing. After multiple requests, the FDA would not directly answer those questions.

Rather, a spokesperson said the regulatory status of a food has no bearing if a contamination happens because a food maker fails to follow good manufacturing practices, as they are required to.

Daily Harvest did not respond to CR's question about what safety testing the company did of tara flour before including it in its French Lentil + Leek Crumbles. [It seems this is a fair question. - Mod.TG]

What to do right now
Consumers should review the ingredient panels of packaged foods to check for the presence of tara flour, says Keating. If you visit a restaurant or deli or use a meal delivery service, ask whether any of its products contain tara flour.

If you feel symptoms arise shortly after consuming a food product containing tara flour or protein, contact your physician, or if your condition worsens or is severe, seek medical attention immediately.

If you experience an illness you think could be related to something you ate, it's always a good idea to report it to your state health department or to the federal government through its form on https://www.foodsafety.gov/food-poisoning/report-problem-with-food# Rogers says.

You can also speak directly to your state's FDA consumer complaint coordinator by calling the phone number listed for your state at https://www.fda.gov/safety/report-problem-fda/consumer-complaint-coordinators.

["Tara flour originates from seeds of the _Tara spinosa_ plant, also known as tara, Peruvian carob, or spiny holdback. This small tree is native to Peru and other parts of South America but has also "been introduced to Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. In the food industry, you can find tara in the form of flour, which is a white or beige powder that has been available in the North American market as a plant-based source of protein. Or as gum, which is used as a thickening agent, stabilizer, or gelling agent to improve the texture of food in certain products.

"According to the FDA's Department of Health and Human Services documentation, tannic acid obtained by solvent extraction of tara seed pods has been categorized as "direct food substances affirmed as generally recognized as safe." Tara seed flour is known for its high levels of protein, and some nutrients, containing about 12 grams of protein, 85 milligrams of calcium, and 729 milligrams of potassium per serving. This is, in part, why Daily Harvest looked to the ingredient when configuring a plant-based alternative meat product."
(https://www.wellandgood.com/how-to-wash-produce/)

When all is considered, I wonder if tara flour is the culprit, or what other contaminant has been ground into the flour? Perhaps a false tara plant, if there is such a thing?

Numerous other plants may be mistaken for a different plant. I wonder if the tara plant has been misidentified if indeed it is the true culprit. I don't see evidence of any genetic testing of the plant. Likely, there is some testing to ensure it is the tara flour, but I am curious if there is any other plant that could have unintentionally been harvested at the same time.

Hopefully, this will be resolved soon. - Mod.TG

Interestingly and with coincidental timing, a Revive Superfood's tara flour-containing product has also been implicated as causing illness/liver issues (https://abc7news.com/revive-superfoods-tara-flour-poisoning-mango-pineapple-smoothies-daily-harvest/12062344/). As noted in TG's comment above, tara plants contain tannic acid/tannins so one has to wonder if there are residual tannins in some batches of the flour product as acute ingestion of large amounts of tannins can cause gastrointestinal illness, abdominal pain, and liver damage (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/tannin#:~:text=Tannic%20acid%20is%20moderately%20toxic,result%20in%20centralobular%20liver%20necrosis). - Mod.JH

This story is emerging -- it seems -- entirely from consumer reports; I have seen nothing from clinicians, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or state epidemiologists. ProMED would be grateful for some hard data from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.SH
