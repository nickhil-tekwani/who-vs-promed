A man in his 60s from southeastern Massachusetts is the 4th Massachusetts resident to be infected with Eastern equine encephalitis [virus] and is currently hospitalized.

The case in a Plymouth County resident triggered state public health officials to raise the threat level for the mosquito-borne illness to "high" in the southeastern communities of Duxbury, Marshfield, Norwell, and Plymouth, and they are recommending that outdoor evening events be cancelled until the 1st hard frost.

"Today's announcement is yet another serious reminder that the threat of mosquito-borne illness is still with us, and will remain so until we see the 1st hard overnight frost," said state epidemiologist Dr. Al DeMaria in a statement. "People need to continue to use insect repellant, cover up exposed skin, and avoid being outdoors at dusk and after nightfall when mosquitoes are at their most active."

Last year, 2 people were infected with EEE [virus] in Massachusetts. A Bristol County man died of the disease and the other case was a tourist. Among the 4 people infected this summer was a Worcester man in his 70s who died of the disease.

[EEE virus infections are relatively uncommon but can be serious, leading to death or neurological damage in survivors. One hopes that the public in Massachusetts will heed the advice of public health authorities and take positive measures to avoid mosquito bites. - Mod. TY
