This year's [2012] "epidemic cycle" of dengue fever could result in the Kingdom's worst recorded epidemic of the disease, Ministry of Health officials said yesterday [28 Feb 2012].

There is an "unusual increase" in mosquito larvae in the 1st part of 2012, which could signal a pending mosquitoborne disease outbreak, dengue control program director Ngan Chantha said yesterday [28 Feb 2012]. "At the moment, it is an unusual increase, not an outbreak or high alert situation, but we need the public to be informed and aware," Ngan Chantha said.

"With dengue, it is mainly an issue in the cities and towns because the larvae grow in still water often in built-up areas," he said, adding that residents in all major cities should take care to keep clean households to prevent breeding grounds for the mosquito. Dengue mosquitoes are commonly found in urban areas, while malarial mosquitoes tend to be in rural or forested areas, he said.

According to government information published yesterday [28 Feb 2012], 2007 was the worst recorded outbreak of dengue fever in Cambodia. Some 40 000 children were infected during the epidemic and 400 were killed by the disease.

"With the dengue mosquito we all have to be aware," Ngan Chantha said. "The dengue mosquito bites everyone, old and young, rich and poor."

[According to the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office's (WPRO) report on the dengue situation, dated 10 Feb 2012, a total of 175 cases and one death due to dengue infection, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.5 per cent, were reported between 1 Jan 2012 and 24 Jan 2012. More cases were reported in Cambodia in 2012 than for the same period in 2011, when a total of 105 cases and one death, with a CFR of 1 per cent, were reported (see http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/1D7FE387-302A-485C-9417-C8D740B249A9/0/07_Feb_2012DengueBiWeekly.pdf).

High activity of dengue infection (39 851 cases and 407 deaths), with a CFR of 1.02 per cent, was reported in Cambodia in 2007. In 2011, a total of 15 980 cases and 73 deaths attributable to dengue infection, with a CFR of 0.5 per cent, were identified in Cambodia (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Cambodia 20120104.0020).
