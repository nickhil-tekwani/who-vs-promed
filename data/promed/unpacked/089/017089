Elephants are at risk for contracting tuberculosis, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It appears that the
pachyderms can pick up the disease from humans, and may also transmit it to
their keepers.
At least four animals in the US have tested positive for tuberculosis (TB)
and three have died. One elephant that died in March 1996 was in a group of
five elephants performing in a circus in California. A second in the same
group died during the return trip to their main residence, an exotic animal
farm in Illinois.
Of the 22 handlers that had contact with the elephants in Illinois, 12
showed signs of exposure to _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ and one handler had
an active infection. The strains of bacteria in elephants and humans were
identical, confirming that TB had been transmitted between the two species.
However, the risk to the public at large is small, according to the CDC.
"Because TB is transmitted through close prolonged contact with a person (or
animal) with active TB, the general public is not at high risk since their
contact is probably limited to brief encounters, such as watching a circus
act or receiving an elephant ride," according to a CDC report. "The risk of
TB transmission to animal handlers with close animal contract is higher than
to those with limited animal contact, and the researchers recommend that
handlers be regularly tested for TB."
Elephants with any symptoms of TB infection, such as weight loss, cough, or
runny trunk discharge, should be tested for the bacteria and treated if
necessary.

[The risk to dairy cattle of a tubercular stockman is a long recognised
problem. In this instance it would be of value to know the positive rates
for animal handlers not working with elephants (but who had presumably been
in social contact with the active human case), and the reactor rate for
elephants on the exotic animal farm which had not toured with the
circus-four survivors. Similarly, how many negative elephants had positive
handlers, and vice versa. These data would give a better appreciation of the
lateral spread risks from actively infected human(s) and elephants. mod MHJ
