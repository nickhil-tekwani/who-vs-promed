From: Guomundur Petursson <gpet@rhi.hi.is>

In response to your e-mail I am sending you a statement on the horse
disease in Iceland recently releases by the Chief Veterinary Officer of
Iceland. I can add that we at this institute have tried to isolated a virus
using primary horse fetal cells (kidney, lungs ovary) but without success.

UPDATE NO 4. ON A NEW DISEASE IN HORSES IN ICELAND.
1. ETIOLOGY.
In spite of extensive investigation in Iceland, Sweden, Germany, USA, UK,
the exact nature of the causal agent of this disease has not yet been
determined, but electron microscope pictures form the Animal Health trust
in UK and the behaviour of the disease strongly indicate that it is an
enterovirus belonging to the family of picornaviruses. The virus is most
likely common to horses in Europe and elsewhere without it being recognised
as a clinical entity.
2. EPIDEMIOLOGY.
2.1. Horses are the only species affected, morbidity is almost 100%, but
mortality is low or only ca. 0.2%.
2.2. The disease started in the Reykjavík area with the first cases being
identified in mid February. By now it has more or less spread all over the
country.
2.3. The causal agent seems to spread both by direct contact between horses
and with movement of people between stables. Last winter it seemed also to
be spread with wind or with small birds.
2.4. Our studies indicate that horses carry the infective agent for two to
three weeks, but it seems to be able to persist in horse stables for at
least four weeks.
3. CLINICAL SIGNS.
3.1. Clinical findings. Incubation time is from 2 to 8 days. Most horses
seem only mildly affected with slightly elevated temperature and some
degree of listlessness. However, some horses have temperature up to 42°C
and go off their feed for couple of days. No abnormal signs are seen from
the respiratory system. Some mares get eclampsia, but early cases can be
treated with calcium infusions. Foals born to mares that were infected
during pregnancy are born healthy and seem to get immunity with the
colostrum. So far horses that were infected in the first stages of the
epidemic, do not become affected again.
3.2. Post Mortem findings. Hyperaemia and bleeding of the mucosa is seen in
uncomplicated cases. Secondary bacterial infections are believed to be the
reason for various post mortem findings, such as swollen kidneys and
atrophy of the epithelial cells in the intestinal villi and crypts.
4. DIAGNOSIS.
On clinical signs, often only on elevated temperature and listlessness in a
number of horses in the same stables or herd. Early cases were mistaken for
listeriosis.

6. CONTROL.
To start with strict measures were taken in the attempt to contain the
disease to the Reykjavík area and all export was stopped. In spite of this,
the disease spread very rapidly to the whole of the South - West of
Iceland, with the rest of the country being unaffected for a long time.
Then one case came up in the North of Iceland and has spread very slowly
since to other areas in the North and the East. Export was resumed in June,
in accordance with a new regulation demanding, amongst other things, a 10
days quarantine in Iceland before export.
7. FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS.
All efforts are being made to discover the exact nature of the infectious
agent. It seems to be very difficult to culture this agent on various cell
lines. Nasal and throat samples from horses are being sent to Dr. Timoney,
Kentucky, USA. A complete account of this disease will be published later
this year.
