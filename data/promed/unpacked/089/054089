Bird flu hits Bengal again
--------------------------
A fresh outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (bird flu)
has been reported from West Bengal. About 20 backyard poultry birds
were reported to have died on [20 May 2009] in the rural areas of
Uttar Dinajpur in West Bengal, not far from the Assam and Bangladesh
border.

These birds were confirmed on 25 May [2009] to have died of the most
virulent H5N1 strain of bird flu. All the samples tested by the High
Security Animal Disease Laboratory, Bhopal, and the National
Institute of Virology, Pune, had tested positive for this virus.

The animal husbandry department formally notified the outbreak of
bird flu in the area to the World Organisation of Animal Health (OIE)
on 28 May 2009. It also told OIE that measures -- curbs on the
movement of poultry products, screening and culling of domestic
poultry in a 3 km [2 mi] radius around the outbreak spots -- have
already been taken.

No vaccination or treatment of the affected birds has been resorted
to, as part of the government's strategy to tackle bird flu. The
places of infection would be suitably disinfected.

The latest eruption of bird flu has occurred around 6 months after
the last outbreak of this disease in Hajo, Rajabazar, and Kamrup
areas of Assam. About 325 birds had died of H5N1 infection at the
time. Besides, over 52 000 birds in a 3 km area around these spots
were culled [but see commentary].

The 1st outbreak of bird flu in India had occurred in Navapur and
Uchchal around the Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh border in February
2006. Since then, there have been several outbreaks in different
parts of the country, causing huge economic losses to the poultry
industry. The organised poultry industry is currently believed to be
worth over Rs 30 000 crores [approx. USD 6.4 billion].

Following successful containment of the disease in the epicentres of
infection between 2006 and 2008, India had formally declared itself
bird flu-free country on 4 Nov 2008. But this status did not last
long. Barely 3 weeks later, the disease resurfaced in the Kamrup
(rural) district of Assam.

[The previous HPAI H5N1 outbreak in West Bengal, reported to the OIE,
took place in Uttar Dinajpur and reportedly started on 17 Mar 2009.

The current outbreak has been notified to the OIE in India's
follow-up report dated 28 May 2009. The report, including a map, is
available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=8139>.
It includes the following epidemiological comment:
"Epidemiological investigation is ongoing. Stamping out of all
domestic poultry is being applied in an approximately 3-km-radius
zone around the outbreaks followed by compensation of the owners.
An intensive surveillance campaign has been launched in a 10-km [6
mi]-radius zone including:
- closure of poultry markets and prohibition on sale and
transportation of poultry products in the infected zone;
- disinfection of premises after culling and sealing of premises
where appropriate.
Restocking will be permitted in accordance with protocol followed in
this regard."
