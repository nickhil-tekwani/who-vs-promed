Dr. Ian Lipkin of the University of California at Irvine [USA] and his
colleagues have identified 100 percent of the genome of the West
Nile virus that caused the encephalitis outbreak in New York in
August of this year. The report appears in this week's Lancet.
This study marks the first time any scientist has cloned a viral genome in
the human brain, using a technique which may help identify causes of
encephalitis in other outbreaks.
Using reverse-transcription PCR (polymerase chain reaction), the scientists
identify the virus as a West Nile virus (WNV) virtually identical to a West
Nile virus that was found in an outbreak in Israel in 1998. It is also very
similar to a virus found in Egypt, they report. These similarities suggest
a Middle Eastern origin for the New York outbreak.
Noting the existence of two international airports in the New York City
area where WNV was prevalent, the article suggests that potential routes
for introduction of the virus into the Eastern United States include
importation of infected birds, mosquitoes and viremic human beings.
Co-authors include Lipkin, Xi-Yu Jie, Thomas Brieze, Ingo Jordan,
Andrew Rambadt, Hen Chang Chi, John S. Mackenzie, Roy A. Hall
and Jacqui Scharret.

[As important as this work is, it is even more important with respect
to the possibility of using these same techniques to fish out sequences of
a variety of viruses from brain, lung, liver, and other tissues from
people who died with otherwise undiagnosed illnesses. - Mod.CHC]
