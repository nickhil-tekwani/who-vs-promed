Bulgarian health experts fear that the number of hepatitis patients will
double by the end of the year, bTV stated on Wed 30 Aug 2006. An epidemic
in Plovdiv's Stolipinovo district, populated by Roma, has continued to grow.
Health Ministry experts have reported 83 new cases in a single week. That
makes a total of 355 infected there, and there are surely some undiscovered
cases, too.
Meanwhile, medics are alarmed that the disease could be spreading to
non-Roma people in the city as well, because families of the infected did
not observe any special measures to prevent further infections.

[The etiologic agent is not specified, but it is likely to be a virus such
as hepatitis A virus or hepatitis E virus, which are spread by waterborne
routes and by contact, rather than one of the bloodborne types of
hepatitis. Further information would be appreciated from an informed local
source.
Plovdiv is located in south-central Bulgaria. A map of Bulgaria can be
