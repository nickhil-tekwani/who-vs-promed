A case of glandular bubonic plague in Gobisumber aimag was confirmed
this week. [In Mongolia, an aimag is the 1st level administrative
subdivision or province. Each aimag is again subdivided into sums. - Mod.LL]
A 16-year-old boy in Choir, the capital city of the aimag, showed
symptoms of the plague, some days after he had cut his finger while
skinning a marmot hunted by his father. The marmot is a primary
carrier of the plague bacillus in Mongolia.
The preliminary diagnosis was confirmed by tests at the National
Center for Infectious Disease with Natural Foci (NCIDNF). The boy's
condition is now stable, according to local authorities.
[The Center has sent] 5 veterinary surgeons to Choir to assess the
situation. Detailed investigations identified 57 persons with whom
the boy came into direct contact during the incubation period. Of
them, 54 found in the area were isolated and given preventive medical
treatment. [Of these,] 40 have been since released, as they showed no
symptoms during the incubation period.

[Uncomplicated bubonic (glandular) plague is not transmissible from
person-to-person. It is only when _Yersinia pestis_ bacilli spread to
the lungs through a bacteremia or is initially acquired from aerosol
spread that contacts would be at risk.
Choir (which is often spelled Tsoir or Chojr) is the capital of the
province of Gobisumber (also spelled Govisumber) and the province in
Mongolia can be found on a map at
<http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Govisumber>. - Mod.LL]
[Plague is endemic in Mongolian marmots and their fleas, but as roast
marmot ("boodog" in Mongolian) is a popular dish there, some unlucky
hunters catch it every year. See marmot photo at
