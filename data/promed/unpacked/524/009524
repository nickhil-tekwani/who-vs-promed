Cluster of travel-associated Legionnaires' disease in Lazise, Italy,
July to August 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 17 cases of travel-associated Legionnaires' disease have
been reported since 18 August 2011 that were associated with a stay in
several accommodation sites in Lazise, Italy. All cases -- 7 from the
Netherlands, 6 from Germany, 2 from Italy, one from Austria and one
from Denmark -- stayed at 5 different accommodation sites (2 campsites
and 3 hotels) in Lazise between the beginning of July and end of
August 2011. Dates of symptom onset ranged from 18 Jul 2011 to 25 Aug
2001 (Figure). The ages of the cases ranged from 42 to 78 years (mean:
57; standard deviation: 11.9) and the male to female ratio was 3.3 to
1.

Background
----------
Legionnaires' disease is a lung infection caused by _Legionella_
bacteria. The bacteria live in water or wet soil and must be inhaled
to cause infection. _Legionella_ can cause a severe form of pneumonia
(Legionnaires' disease), which in Europe can be fatal for about 5-15
percent of people with the disease, but it can also cause a mild
influenza-like infection without pneumonia, called Pontiac fever [1].

Over the last 10 years, the number of cases of Legionnaires' disease
in Italy has been steadily increasing, from 325 cases in 2001 to 1200
cases in 2009, with an incidence in 2009 of 2 per 100 000 population
[2,3]. The number of cases of travel-associated Legionnaires' disease
has also been increasing: every year, several clusters associated with
accommodation sites, involving tourists from Italy and elsewhere in
Europe, are reported [4,6]. Most of this increase has been attributed
to improved diagnostic tools, in particular the urinary antigen
detection test [7].

The European Legionnaires' Disease Surveillance Network (ELDSNet),
coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
(ECDC) since April 2010, carries out surveillance of Legionnaires'
disease, involving all European Union Member States, Iceland and
Norway. It aims to identify relevant public health risks, enhance
disease prevention and monitor epidemiological trends. In this
context, surveillance of travel-associated disease is carried out on a
day-to-day basis to inform urgent public health action, with the aim
of preventing subsequent cases. Each travel-associated case of
Legionnaires' disease diagnosed in a participating European country is
reported by national ELDSNet collaborators to ELDSNet as quickly as
possible. If other cases are found to have been associated with a
particular accommodation site within a 2-year period, a cluster is
identified. A rapid risk assessment of the accommodation site
associated with the cluster is undertaken by the country in which the
site is located: the results are reported to ECDC and shared with all
countries in the network [8,9].

Testing isolates and data collection
------------------------------------
Of the 17 reported cases reported in Lazise, 16 were confirmed by a
urinary antigen test and one case remained probable because diagnosis
was on the basis of a single high Legionella-specific antibody titre.
_Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 was isolated from 2 patients: one
had stayed at Campsite 1 and one at Campsite 2. There were no deaths.

Lazise is a small town located about 20 km (12.4 miles) north-west of
Verona, by Lake Garda (the largest lake in the country). It has 7000
inhabitants and there are an estimated 60 000 visitors during the
summer holiday period. Legionnaires' disease was not reported in
Lazise inhabitants in July and August 2011. The disease has been
reported in tourists staying in neighbouring villages in the Lake
Garda area, as expected based on the previous years' notifications
(unpublished data).

Patients were contacted by ELDSNet national collaborators in their
country of residence. Information about potential exposure in the 10
days preceding the onset of symptoms (incubation period for
Legionnaires' disease is 2-10 days) was obtained using a standardised
questionnaire: national ELDSNet collaborators of the countries where
cases were reported recorded the details in an ad hoc
restricted-access web-based database set up by ELDSNet. Analysis of
the data revealed common accommodation sites but no other common
exposure.

Ongoing investigations
----------------------
Epidemiological and environmental investigations, which started
immediately after notification of the cluster by ELDSNet on 19 August
2011, are ongoing. The Istituto Superiore di Sanita is supporting the
local health authorities in Lazise.

Of the 17 reported cases, 12 had stayed in Campsite 1 (accommodating
about 3500 people), 2 had stayed in Hotel 1 (with about 40 rooms), 2
in 2 different hotels (Hotels 2 and 3 with about 50 rooms each) and
one in Campsite 2 (accommodating about 1800 people).

Of the 5 accommodations sites, 3 (Campsite 1, Campsite 2 and Hotel 1)
were found to be within approximately 500 metres (1/3 mile) of each
other. The water sources for the 5 accommodation sites are different:
the 2 campsites are supplied by private wells while the 3 hotels are
supplied by the same public service. Local rapid risk assessment was
promptly carried out [10] and several water samples were collected for
testing by the regional and the national reference laboratories
according to procedures indicated for the control and prevention of
legionellosis [11]. In the 1st round of sampling, 56 samples of cold
and hot water were collected from water tanks, taps, shower heads,
swimming pools, water sprinklers, decorative fountains and jacuzzis at
the 5 accommodation sites. 2 samples from Campsite 1 were found
positive for _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, with a concentration of 900
and 4100 colony forming units per liter (CFU/L). These 2 samples had
been collected from distal water outlets in one of the 7 washing and
toilet facilities. In Hotel 2, 3 samples were found positive for _L.
pneumophila_ serogroup 1, at concentrations ranging from 2000 to 12
000 CFU/L. _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 2-14 was isolated from other
water points in all 5 accommodation sites.

No cooling towers were found in Lazise and its outskirts. To date, no
installations have been identified as a potential source of
Legionella.

Typing of Legionella isolates
-----------------------------
The 2 _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 clinical isolates were
characterised by sequence-based typing [12]: both were sequence type
(ST) 23, as were the 2 _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 isolates from the
environmental samples. Further molecular investigations are ongoing.

Control measures
----------------
A rapid risk assessment conducted promptly in all 5 accommodation
sites allowed us to implement control measures. Disinfection of the
water systems in all 5 accommodation sites involved was carried out as
a control measure and all devices generating aerosols (e.g. spa pools,
lawn sprinklers and decorative fountains) were immediately
deactivated. Hospitals and general practitioners (GPs) in the area
were alerted in order to enhance clinical surveillance of the disease.
People staying at Campsite 1 (which reported the greatest number of
cases) and for whom e-mail addresses were available were informed by
e-mail of the ongoing cluster of the disease and were encouraged to
contact their GPs if they developed symptoms. Managers of all the
accommodation sites, spas and other recreational sites in the
municipality were also informed through a note issued by the mayor of
Lazise and were made aware of the importance of adopting adequate
measures to prevent legionellosis.

Environmental sampling, repeated after disinfection of the water
systems, was negative for Legionella and no further cases have been
notified after the risk management measures were adopted.

Conclusion
----------
As a common source of infection in Lazise has not yet been identified,
there may be an ongoing risk of exposure to Legionella for persons
visiting or residing in the town. For this reason, we encourage timely
notification of further cases potentially associated with stay in
Lazise.

[The above Eurosurveillance report gives the latest findings on the
outbreak of Legionnaires' disease among tourists staying at 5
different sites in the northern Italian town of Lazise. There is now a
total of 17 cases; 16 were confirmed by a urinary antigen test for
_Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 and one case remained probable
because diagnosis was on the basis of a single high
Legionella-specific antibody titer. _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 was
isolated from 2 patients and from water samples at 2 locations. All
were sequence type 23. No common source of infection has yet been
identified. The water systems were disinfected in all 5 accommodation
sites.
