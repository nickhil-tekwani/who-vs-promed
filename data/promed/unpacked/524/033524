Rhode Island: 1st Death Due to West Nile Virus Infection
------------------------------------------------
The state Department of Health reported its first West Nile
virus-related fatality on Tue 25 Nov 2003, after a man who had been
ill for more than a month died from West Nile virus infection of the
brain. The man's identity was not released, but he was described as a
senior citizen from Providence County. He died on Fri 21 Nov 2003
from meningoencephalitis, a viral infection of the brain and
surrounding tissue, after contracting West Nile virus from infected
mosquitoes.
A Health Department spokesman, Robert Marshall, said that the case is
typical of other West Nile fatalities, in that it involved a victim
in the 65-and-above age group. Marshall said just 1 percent of those
infected with West Nile virus develop a severe disease, and most of
those who do are elderly. 3-15 percent of those who develop severe
disease die, Marshall said.
Rhode Island has reported a total of 7 confirmed cases of West Nile
virus infection in humans -- one in 2002 and in 2003 this year [The
CDC-ArboNET data (see below) list 7 cases in Rhode Island in 2003 -
Mod.CP]. Marshall said the other patients are recovering. The man's
illness was first reported on 5 Oct 2003. He was discharged from the
hospital into hospice care on 7 Nov 2003.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of 19
Nov 2003, there had been 189 fatalities from West Nile virus
infection nationwide in 2003. A total of 8470 cases of the virus had
been reported.
[As of Tue 25 Nov 2003 the CDC-ArboNET figures are now 8567 cases and
199 deaths. The Rhode Island fatality, which is not listed, increases
the deaths total for the year 2003 to 200. - Mod.CP]

[As of Tue 25 Nov 2003, in the USA only 4 states -- Hawaii, Alaska,
Nevada, and Oregon -- have remained entirely free of West Nile virus
infection of any animal species (apart from travel-related human
cases) since the appearance of the virus in North America.
The weekly counts of new human cases during the past 13 weeks have
been 414, 1046, 1214, 690, 1034, 646, 450, 429, 332, 502, 176, 77,
and now 98.
The 3 western/midwestern states of Colorado, Nebraska and South
Dakota, together with the state of Texas, have accounted for 67.3
percent (5763/8567) of the total number of confirmed human cases, and
53.8 percent (107/199) percent of fatalities during 2003. - Mod.CP]
