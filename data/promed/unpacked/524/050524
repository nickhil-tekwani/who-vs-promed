Avian influenza ï¿½ situation in Thailand 26 July 2006
---------------
The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has
confirmed a case of human infection with H5N1
avian influenza. The patient, a 17-year-old man
from Thap Khlo district of Phichit province in
the north, developed symptoms on 15 Jul [2006],
was hospitalized on 20 Jul [2006] and died on 24 Jul [2006].
On 10 Jul [2006], the young man had buried the
carcasses of dead chickens. This case coincides
with a recurrence of a confirmed H5N1 outbreak in
animals in the province. Control measures have
been implemented to contain the animal outbreak
and human surveillance has been strengthened.
Field investigations have not found any
indications of respiratory illness in close contacts of the young man.
This is the 1st human case of H5N1 infection reported from Thailand in 2006.

Thailand: Another Suspected Human Case of Bird Flu; 5 Others Unconfirmed
-----------------------------------------------
A 17-year-old youth from the northern province of
Phichit who died from acute lung infection and
flu-like symptoms on Mon 24 Jul 2006 had probably
been infected with the deadly H5N1 avian
influenza virus, a senior Public Health official
revealed yesterday [25 Jul 2006]. "There is a
high possibility that this man died from avian
influenza," the official said, adding that
doctors had failed to detect the virus because
the tissue samples from the patient had deteriorated.
The official said the youth, from Thap Khlo
district, was admitted to the hospital last
Tuesday after developing a high fever. His
condition deteriorated rapidly. The teenager had
buried about 20 fowl that had died of unknown
causes in his village shortly before he fell ill.
Post-mortem results on the cause of his death
would be released today [Wed 26 Jul 2006], said the official.
The announcement came a day after the Agriculture
and Cooperatives Ministry on Mon 24 Jul 2006
confirmed a fresh outbreak of the H5N1 bird flu
strain in Phichit's Bang Mun Nak district, the
1st in the country in 8 months. The virus was
found in a fighting cock carcass. The district
has been declared a bird flu-infected area, which
allows the authorities to employ full-scale
disease control measures, including eradication,
quarantine, controls on fowl movements and
disinfection of affected premises. The UN Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) yesterday [25
Jul 2006] called on Thailand to conduct an
"intense investigation" into the reemergence of
bird flu and trace the possible spread of the
virus from the northern province of Phichit. The
international body also emphasized the importance
of "early detection" and "rapid and transparent
international reporting" to curb the spread of
the virus. The recurrence of bird flu in Phichit
reaffirmed the FAO's concern about the potential
for the disease to resurface in high-risk areas,
said Laurence Gleeson, regional manager of the
FAO's emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal
Diseases yesterday [25 Jul 2006]. Further
investigations should be carried out to determine
the source of the infection, he said. "The FAO
will continue to closely monitor Thailand's bird
flu prevention and control programs and offer
assistance to the Livestock Development
Department (LDD) in its control efforts," he said
Meanwhile, the Department of Medical Sciences
yesterday [25 Jul 2006] announced that 5
suspected human bird flu cases from Phichit,
Uttaradit, Phitsanulok, and Phetchabun, had
tested negative for H5N1. Department chief Paijit
Warachit said the 5 patients, including a
12-year-old girl from Phichit, were only infected
with the human influenza virus.

Thailand: Local Test Confirms Avian Influenza Death
-----------------------------------------------
A 17-year-old Thai has died of the H5N1 bird flu
virus, the country's 15th death since the virus
swept across parts of Asia in late 2003, a senior
health official said on Wed 26 Jul 2006. The
young man died on Mon 24 Jul 2006 in the northern
province of Phichit, where the authorities have
confirmed the country's 1st outbreak of the virus
among poultry in 8 months. "The final lab test
confirmed that he died of bird flu," Kamnuan
Ungchusak, Head of the Health Ministry's
Epidemiology Bureau, told Reuters by telephone
from the hospital where the youth died. He is
believed to have caught the virus while helping
his father bury dead chickens last week. The
father remained healthy, Kamnuan said. "We have
quarantined the family, and there is no report of a new case yet," he said.
The last death in Thailand occurred in December
2005. Not including the latest death, bird flu
has killed 132 people worldwide since the virus
reemerged in Asia in 2003, the World Health
Organization says. At present, H5N1 remains
essentially a disease of birds and is hard for
people to catch. But scientists fear the virus
could mutate into a form that spreads easily
among humans and trigger a pandemic in which millions could die.

[These reports identify an 8th suspected human
case of H5N1 avian influenza in Thailand.
However, 5 other suspected cases previously
reported have now been diagnosed as cases of
seasonal influenza virus infection. Local
laboratory testing has confirmed that the death
of the 17-year-old youth in Phichit province is a
consequence of H5N1 avian influenza virus
infection. Confirmation of a case of human
infection is not unexpected now that a resurgence
of avian influenza in poultry in Thailand has
been described within the past few days (see:
Avian influenza (159) - Thailand, H5N1 confirmed 20060724.2042).
A final verdict from an international reference
laboratory is awaited on this case and that of 2
other outstanding cases associated with
consumption of a (wild?) dove. - Mod.CP]
