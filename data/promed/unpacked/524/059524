Report date: 11 Feb 2020
Date submitted to OIE: 11 Feb 2020
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: African swine fever [ASF] virus
Nature of diagnosis: Clinical, laboratory (basic)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (11)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 11
Outbreak cluster location: Western Area rural and urban, Western Area Rural, Western Rural (11 outbreaks)
Date of start of the outbreak: 20 Sep 2019
Outbreak status: Resolved on 30 Dec 2019
Epidemiological unit: Backyard
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 10 946 / 619 / 605 / 2 / 0
Affected population: The outbreak was in free-range backyards and confined in both Western Area Rural and Urban.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Swine / 5.66 / 5.53 / 97.74 / 5.55
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: An investigation was carried out in 12 communities in Western Area Rural and Urban; most farmers leave their pigs scavenging along the ocean in dumping sites. Farmers were disposing of dead pigs in the same ocean. Estimated herd mortality ranges from 0 to 99.4% in affected communities. Samples were collected and tested at the Central Veterinary Laboratory Teko-Makeni, where African swine fever virus was confirmed.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
USA Department of Agriculture Laboratory (foreign laboratory) / Swine / Real-time PCR / 4 Feb 2020 / Positive
Central Veterinary Laboratory (national laboratory) / Swine / Antibody detection ELISA / 12 Nov 2019 / Positive

["ASF has a severe socio-economic impact and implications for nutrition and food security, both in areas where it is newly introduced and where it is endemic. The high impact is most apparent in countries with a significant commercial pig industry, but this does not mean that smallholder pig farmers are in any way spared. In Africa, ASF has devastating effects on both the commercial and subsistence pig production sectors, but the greatest losses are usually inflicted on the poorer pig producers who are less likely to implement effective prevention (i.e., biosecurity) and control strategies. The consequences of ASF include major economic losses throughout the pig value chain and considerable social effects, such as loss of employment for farm workers and loss of income for farmers. Pig production is an important source of high quality and cheap dietary protein in many countries, particularly for poor communities, and the income generated is used to access a variety of dietary requirements. The farmers often lack financial resources to restart production following outbreaks in the absence of compensation schemes and recovery plans.

"Outbreaks of ASF in the recent past have resulted in losses of between 30% and 50% of the pig populations in a number of countries. In some cases, the entire village pig populations are wiped out either by ASF-related deaths or stamping out measures." (http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6053e.pdf).
