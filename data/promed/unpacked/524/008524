There were 2 cases of wound botulism in injection drug users in the Dallas/Fort Worth (TX) area. This is a life-threatening progressive disease.

Symptoms can worsen to respiratory failure. Injection drug users need to know that wound botulism can start with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, dizziness, dysphagia, and shortness of breath. They must seek medical care promptly.

Cases that are found will be reported to Texas Department of State Health Services.

[Wound botulism occurs when spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ contaminate a wound, germinate, and produce botulinum neurotoxin in vivo. Most of the wound botulism cases have been among injecting drug users (IDUs). Those IDUs who intentionally or accidentally inject subcutaneously or intramuscularly may be particularly vulnerable to infection.

Black tar heroin continues to be associated with clusters of wound botulism, both in the USA and in Europe. This form of heroin is a gummy black substance usually produced in makeshift factories, mostly in Mexico, adjacent to opium poppy fields (1). It is generally injected subcutaneously in a process referred to as skin popping. The local area may be unremarkable or may be necrotic or abscess forming.

The tarry nature of the drug has led to a number of diluents ("cutting" agents), which have been postulated to be the source of the _C. botulinum_ spores. In Passaro's study (1), the development of wound botulism was not affected by cleaning the skin, cleaning the injection paraphernalia, or sharing needles.

Clinicians should suspect botulism in any patient with a descending, flaccid paralysis. Botulinum antitoxin is effective in reducing the severity of symptoms for all forms of botulism if administered early in the course of the disease and should not be delayed for the results of microbiological testing.

In cases of wound botulism, antimicrobial therapy and surgical debridement are necessary to remove the organism and avoid relapse after antitoxin treatment. _C. botulinum_ is sensitive to benzyl penicillin and metronidazole.

Toxin type A (one of 7 types of botulinum toxin) causes most cases of both foodborne and wound botulism in the USA. The syndrome produced by toxin type A is most severe, with more rapid progression of paralysis and a higher proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. All toxin types exert their action on the cholinergic system at the presynaptic motor-neuron terminal by blocking acetylcholine transmission across the neuromuscular junction.
