Iowa: Mumps Outbreak Linked to Primary Vaccine Failure
-----------------------------------------------
The tally of mumps cases has climbed to 300 in an outbreak that started in
Iowa and has spread to all bordering states, with the exception of South
Dakota. Meghan Harris M.P.H., of the Iowa Department of Public Health, said
that the latest state affected by mumps is Missouri, which has reported a
single case. The tally, which was released here today [5 Apr 2006], has
increased by 55 cases since Fri 31 Mar 2006. Harris said she expects the
numbers to be higher when the next scheduled update is issued Thu 6 Apr 2006.
Follow-up reports have been completed on 154 cases. Of those, 68 percent
occurred in people who had received the recommended 2 doses of the
measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Iowa, according to Harris, is a state
with a high vaccination rate, and she anticipates the majority of mumps
infections will occur in people who are considered safe on the basis of
their immunization records. "But we know the vaccine doesn't work in
everyone," she said. Harris said published data suggest that the vaccine
failure rate for mumps is about 5 percent. "So by my estimate, there are
about 200 000 people in Iowa who have received the recommended vaccinations
but who have no immunity to mumps." The current recommendation is that a
1st dose of MMR triple vaccine be administered at age 12-15 months, with a
2nd dose at 4-6 years. But Blaise Congeni, M.D., director of infectious
diseases at the Akron (Ohio) Children's Hospital, said that if the 2nd dose
is missed, it can also be administered during adolescence.
The 300 confirmed, probable, or suspected cases of mumps represent the
nation's largest mumps outbreak in 17 years. Early on, most of the Iowa
cases were reported in college-age students. The mean age at onset was 21,
and almost 45 percent of the cases occurred in 19-year-olds. But Harris
said that no single college or university was implicated in the outbreak.
"We can assume that this outbreak is associated with some aspects of
college life, such as living in dorms or mixing together at the same
clubs," she said. The best explanation, according to Harris, is that
college students "in general have a higher risk of sharing saliva." But the
newer numbers confirmed that the outbreak is moving beyond the college
campuses. 21 percent of cases occurred in students attending college, down
from 23 percent of cases reported by 30 Mar 2006.
The public health data include confirmed, suspect and probable cases of
mumps. Probable cases are those that meet the clinical case definition but
have no confirmed serologic or virologic testing. Suspect cases are those
with positive IgM serology, and confirmed cases are cases that meet
clinical definition that are also laboratory-confirmed or epidemiologically
linked.
Dr. Congeni speculated that it may be difficult to identify an index case,
because the primary symptom of mumps, parotitis, is often not fully
evaluated by clinicians. "If the patient's record indicates that he or she
has been received 2 MMR doses, the assumption would be that this is caused
by another virus," he said. If the symptoms abate, the episode would be
little more than a notation in a medical record.
Harris agreed that Dr. Congeni's theory best explains what has happened in
Iowa, especially since the mumps strain is the same one that caused
outbreaks in England over the past few years. That suggests that mumps
arrived with a recent visitor from Britain, but "because these symptoms are
often overlooked -- especially in people who have received the required
vaccinations -- we doubt we will ever identify the index case," she said.
Dr. Congeni said, however, that a mumps outbreak does not carry the
potential for public health disaster that would be associated with a
measles or rubella outbreak. "There is a small risk that some kids will
develop viral meningitis, and orchitis is a concern, but we know that
orchitis doesn't cause sterility," Dr. Congeni said. As of today, 5 percent
of cases included orchitis among symptoms, and there was one case of
encephalitis being investigated.
