Background
----------
Bats have long been known as natural hosts for lyssaviruses, and more
recently are recognized to be potential reservoirs for emerging human
pathogens, including Ebola, Marburg, Nipah, Hendra viruses, and
SARS-CoV [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus]. Given the
association of bats with SARS-CoV, a study was conducted to detect
CoV [coronaviruses] among bats in Kenya.

Methods
-------
Specimens from 10 to 20 animals of each species present in each of 16
selected locations were collected. Each bat was measured, identified
to the genus or species level as far as possible, bled, swabbed by
the oral and fecal route, and then euthanized in compliance with the
field protocol. In total, we collected a total of 221 bat samples.
Their total nucleic acids (TNA) from fecal swabs were extracted from
200 microliters of a PBS [phosphate-buffered saline]-suspension of
each fecal swab and were screened for the presence of CoV RNA using 2
semi-nested RT-PCR [reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]
assays, the pan coronavirus RT-PCR and the pan bat coronavirus
RT-PCR. The positive PCR products were purified by gel extraction
using QIAquick Gel Extraction kit and sequenced on an ABI Prism 3100
automated sequencer. A phylogenetic tree of the 121 bp fragment of
RdRp was generated from positive Kenyan bat coronaviruses of this
study and 47 selected human and animal coronaviruses from the NCBI
[National Center for Biotechnology Information] database by the
Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain (BMCMC) method.

Results
-------
Of 221 bat fecal swabs examined, 41 (19 percent) were positive by one
or both of the 2 semi-nested RT-PCR assays. These include viruses of
Group I and II as well as viruses phylogenetically related to SARS
coronaviruses. The pattern of CoV detections by bat species and
location demonstrated that diverse CoVs in particular bat species
sampled in one location, and the same CoVs in bats sampled from
distant locations. Furthermore, similar CoVs were detected in
different bat species.

Conclusion
----------
These data demonstrate that the diversity of CoVs in bats, previously
detected in Asia, Europe, and North America, is also present,
possibly to a greater extent, in Africa. The extent of diversity
among CoVs is likely to expand further with additional study in bats.
This increasing diversity in CoVs sequences from bats may require a
reconsideration of how they should be grouped. The frequency and
diversity of CoVs detections in bats, now in multiple continents,
demonstrate that bats are likely an important source for introduction
into other species globally. Understanding the extent and diversity
of CoV infection in bats provides a foundation for detecting new
introductions that may, like SARS, present a public health threat.
