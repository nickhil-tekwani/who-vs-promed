Major concerns have been raised over the potential for African swine
fever [ASF] -- 1st discovered in Georgia and now spread to Russia --
to spread to other countries in Europe.

At the recent World Pork Conference, the head of the Russian
Veterinary Service, Rosselkhoznador, Sergey Dankvert, said that the
disease, which is in the Northern Caucasus region, is in danger of
spreading.

There are fears that the disease, which has seen outbreaks reported in
the Rostov region, could spread to the Ukraine and beyond.

During the same conference, Dr Alejandro Thiermann from the World
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), warned that the spread of the
disease could get out of control, and he said he was concerned that it
could spread to the wild boar herd in central Europe.

The concern is so great that the disease could spread to other
European countries that in Denmark between 11 and 13 Oct 2011, the
Danish veterinary authorities held a simulation exercise, looking at
what would happen if it appeared in the Baltic states.

The 1st part of the exercise was conducted jointly with the Nordic and
Baltic countries: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia,
Lithuania, Norway and Sweden. It included training and exchange of
information between relevant persons in the Nordic and Baltic
countries as well as investigating the exchange of resources within
the areas of personnel and equipment.

For the 2nd part of the simulation exercise, at the national level of
each of the Nordic and Baltic countries, the overall aim was to test
national contingency plans for control of ASF as well as for strategy
and resources. All regional veterinary control offices in each of
these countries will be involved in this exercise as well as part of
the pork industry.

The exercise focused on management of suspicion and outbreaks
including on-farm measures, cleansing and disinfection and crisis
organisation. There was also a jump in time, which made it possible to
focus on planning of screening activities, with the intention to lift
the restriction zones.

The start of the outbreak in Russia came from an incident 1st reported
to the OIE in 2007 in Georgia, the 1st occurrence of the disease in
this part of Europe. The outbreak then spread from Georgia to Russian
herds in the Kaliningradskaya Oblast towards the end of 2009.

Further outbreaks were reported in a wildlife sanctuary near the town
of Sochi in December of 2009, and then another incident was recorded
in a backyard farm in Mozdokskiy Rayon, the Republic of North
Ossetia.

During 2010, further cases of ASF were reported to Rosselkhoznador in
the Krasnodarsky Krai and in the Rostov region. Concerns about the
spread of the disease rose to such a degree last year [2010] that the
potential threat to Ukraine was raised in talks between Sergey
Dankvert and the Minister of the Agrarian Policy of Ukraine, Nikolay
Prisyazhnyk.

With further cases cropping up in the Volgograd and Rostov regions,
the Russian authorities started to raise concerns about how the
quarantine measures and the eradication methods that were being
instituted were also being flouted by many people.

In one incident, Rosselkhoznador reported: "The Territorial
Administration of the Rosselkhoznador for the Voronezhskaya and
Volgogradskaya Oblasts detected a serious violation in the procedure
of issue of veterinary accompanying documents at the SI Bogucharskaya
Regional Station for Animal Disease Control. Such violations may cause
introduction of African swine fever both into the territory of the
Voronezhskaya Oblast and into other Russian Federation Subjects."

The breach of the controls involved documents that had been prepared
for the export of feed grain from the region.

The Territorial Administration detected a violation at the SI
Bogucharskaya Regional Station for Animal Disease Control; a
businessman from the Rostovskaya Oblast had received from the chief
veterinarian of the station 2 veterinary certificates for export of
2000 tonnes of feed wheat by road from the company Stepnoye of the
Bogucharsky region. The investigation showed that more than 30 tonnes
had been shipped from the holding. As a result of the breaches, the
chief veterinarian of the station was dismissed from service, and the
investigation documents were sent to the law enforcement authorities.

In another case, the head of the Veterinary Department of the
Rostovskaya Oblast, who had taken no measures for the control of an
ASF outbreak, was taken to court. He was accused of not sending
samples taken from dead pigs for testing.

There were also accusations of the officials trying to cover up their
mistakes and also allowing animals that had been slaughtered because
of ASF to be sent for processing.

A disturbing jump in the spread of the disease came at the end of
2010, when infected pig carcasses were found dumped in the litter
storehouse of a poultry farm in the Leningraskaya Oblast and St
Petersburg region. Later, further carcasses were found in a rubbish
dump in the St Petersburg area.

Meanwhile, at the beginning of 2011, further cases continued to be
recorded in the Volgograd, Rostov, Kaliningrad and Krasnodar regions
in the south of Russia, and as well around Nizhny Novgorod. Further
reports were of cases found in the Arkhangelsk and Murmansk regions.

However, while measures have been instituted around each outbreak to
contain the disease and further criminal cases have been taken against
inspectors and farmers who have failed to implement the controls
fully, further cases have been reported throughout this year [2011],
and the disease is spreading unabated.

Sergey Dankvert, speaking at the World Pork Conference, gave no
indication that the Russian authorities were likely to get a grip on
the disease any time soon. He said the main problem is that there is
no vaccine to counter the disease. The preventative measures taken
include the destruction of all pigs in a 20-km radius of the
outbreak.

Despite the safeguards, Mr Dankvert's words to the conference left a
stark picture. "We don't know if and when it will spread to the Baltic
countries or through Ukraine to Hungary," Mr Dankvert said. "We can't
kill the disease, because there is no vaccine. "It is like cancer or
AIDS, and you can try to control it, but you can't kill it in nature.
"If you kill the whole herds, the ticks will be there infecting other
animals."

[The lack of ASF vaccine continues as a prominent concern to the pig
industry worldwide. ASF is not zoonotic.
