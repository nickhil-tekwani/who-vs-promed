A report published today [10 Mar 2015] by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) shows that raw milk can contain harmful bacteria and therefore, the consumption of raw (unpasteurised) milk increases the risk of developing foodborne illness. The FSAI continues to recommend that the sale of raw milk for direct human consumption should be prohibited in Ireland and advises that the most effective way to protect public health is to ensure that all milk is effectively heat-treated (for example, pasteurised or boiled), especially when served to infants, children, pregnant women, older people, and those with a weakened immune system or those suffering from a chronic disease.

The report details the results of an FSAI microbiological survey confirming the presence of pathogens in raw milk and the in-line filters used in the milking equipment. For raw milk samples, detection rates of _Listeria monocytogenes_ and _Campylobacter_ were 7 percent and 3 percent, respectively. However, detection rates in milk filter samples were considerably higher at 20 percent and 22 percent respectively, which suggests a greater potential for contamination of raw milk. In addition, _Salmonella_ was detected in 1 percent of raw milk filters and 0.5 percent of raw milk samples, while _E. coli_ O26 (VTEC, [verotoxigenic _E. coli_) was detected in 6 percent of raw milk filter samples showing its potential to contaminate raw milk.

Dr Wayne Anderson, Director of Food Science and Standards, FSAI, states: "Almost all milk on sale in Ireland is pasteurised and pasteurisation is the simplest and most reliable method to ensure that milk is safe to drink. While the market for raw milk is small, it remains a serious concern given the well-documented public health risks posed by the presence of pathogens in raw milk. We are therefore recommending that raw milk should be avoided by consumers, but for those who still wish to drink it, they should, at a minimum, boil the milk before drinking it to kill any potentially harmful bacteria."

Commenting on the ongoing risk to farm families who continue to consume raw milk in their own homes, Dr Anderson states: "The FSAI is aware that any ban on the sale of raw milk would not affect those farm families who choose to consume raw milk. But farm families should be particularly aware of the risk to young children and pregnant women posed by drinking raw milk and also the fact that farm visitors may not be aware that they are consuming raw milk. We therefore continue to recommend the use of home pasteurisers to ensure milk is safe."

Dr Anderson notes that, while on-farm hygiene and animal health on Irish farms have improved immensely over recent years, farms remain a significant reservoir for pathogens. Even under the best hygiene standards, it is possible that raw milk can become contaminated. Improving on-farm sanitation and hygiene will improve the quality of raw milk but will not always guarantee safety.

[Raw milk is produced on farms, not in a laboratory; it should not be expected to be sterile and may include pathogens from animal as well as from environmental source. Veterinary control upon the health of the lactating cows, upon the safety of their feed, combined with hygienic milking techniques, equipment and facilities, are intended to minimise raw milk's contamination but would not exclude it altogether. This will. however, be achieved by pasteurisation.

The findings described in the Irish report are all but surprising; similar and even worse findings are expected in raw milk anywhere. For comparison, the following findings from 2 papers.

In France (Ref 1), where raw milk from 27 farms was sampled, the following pathogens were demonstrated: _Staphylococcus aureus_ and other Micrococcaceae, Pseudomonas, coliforms, _Escherichia coli_, enterococci,
_Clostridium perfringens_. Two of the tested milks (2.9%) were positive for salmonellas, four (5·8%) for _Listeria monocytogenes_, 25 (36%) for _Yersinia enterocolitica_ and one (1·4%) for campylobacters.

In New Zealand (Ref 2), where samples of raw milk were collected monthly within 5 major dairying regions over one year. Each month, samples from 5 randomly selected farm vats in each region were collected for analysis (297 samples in total), the results were better. Campylobacter was isolated once (0.34%). E. coli O157:H7 was not detected whereas non-pathogenic E. coli O157 strains were detected in 1% of samples. _L. monocytogenes_ was isolated from 0.68% of samples. Though salmonella was not detected in this study, the authors concluded:

"The results demonstrate that raw milk sampled from farm vats in New Zealand, as in other countries, inevitably contains recognised pathogens and, hence, control by pasteurisation or an equivalent treatment of raw milk remains paramount. Even so, the prevalence of most of these pathogens was lower than those reported in many of the studies performed in other countries".

Concluding - the consumption of raw, unpasteurised milk is undesirable, even if its contamination has been reduced to the.
minimal achievable rate.

[Clearly, unpasteurized milk represents a risk for the transmission of a host of infections including salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, brucellosis, enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, and many others. Although said to be healthier than its pasteurized "cousin", there is little objective data to support this claim and the morbidity and mortality associated with some of these infections may be quite substantial. This is particularly true in the extremes of life and immunocompromised individual. - Mod.LL
