WHO Advises Africa Travelers to Take Extra Precautions Against Malaria
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned holiday travelers to Africa
to take "all possible precautions" in order to prevent malaria.
"The risk of malaria for travelers is real: each year thousands of
travelers fall ill with malaria, and a proportion of these die, " WHO
Executive Director for Communicable Diseases Dr David Heymann said Friday.
"Most of these deaths could be prevented by using repellents and taking
other measures to prevent mosquito bites in combination with the regular
use of the right anti-malarial drugs for prophylaxis."
According to WHO, it has received numerous reports in recent weeks from
Spain and Germany of travelers falling ill after returning from last minute
package holidays to destinations such as Senegal and Gambia. Similar
reports have come from the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark.
In Southern Africa, WHO said, there is a special need for vigilance over
the coming months as above-normal rainfall is forecast from December 2000
to March 2001, with a corresponding increase in malaria transmission over
most of the region up to May 2001.
WHO has recommended weekly mefloquine prophylaxis for most African
countries. Mefloquine prophylaxis should be started 2 to 3 weeks before
travel [One week before entry is usually sufficient. For travelers who
failed to start prophylaxis in time, daily doxycycline offers an
alternative, as it can be started the day before travel.
Both drugs should be continued during the stay and for 4 weeks after
leaving the endemic area, to cover the incubation period of the disease,
according to WHO.

[Whether the increased number of reports also represent an increased number
of cases is not known, except that the previous dispatch from the UK
indicated that the MRC in The Gambia had experienced an increased number of
expatriates with malaria which was more often resistant to chloroquine than
expected. There is also no doubt that malaria in South Africa towards the
border with Mozambique is on the increase, but there is few actual numbers
from the South African authorities. Some travellers from the Kruger
National Park have reported that the border area between South Africa and
Mozambique was previously sprayed with insecticides regularly, but that
this activity ceased completely a few years ago. A comment about this from
the South African authorities and some statistics on the number of malaria
cases diagnosed is strongly needed.
The WHO message mentions that lariam (mefloquine) should be started 2 - 3
weeks before entry into the malaria endemic area. The standard
recommendation is one week before, but it is common practice to start
lariam 3 weeks before if the traveller is concerned about possible side
effects. The WHO message does not mention malarone (atovaquone/proguanil)
as an alternative although it is registered in the USA and Denmark.
Malarone is highly efficient without the occasional neuropsychiatric
adverse reactions seen under lariam use. Malarone is especially efficient
against the liver stage and can therefore be used from the day before entry
and for only 7 days after departure from the malarious area. - Mod.EP
