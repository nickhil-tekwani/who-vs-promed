Spanish authorities have linked an outbreak of _Listeria_ [infection] that has affected more than 40 people to a brand of meat. La Consejeria de Salud y Familias de la Junta de Andalucia [The Ministry of Health and Families of Andalucia] reported those ill lived in Seville and Huelva and became sick in the past 3 weeks.

The agency connected illnesses to the product by interviewing patients. It has a commercial name of "La Mecha" and is made by the company Magrudis, based in Seville. The item has been withdrawn from sale.

Local media reported that 44 people were affected. Half of them needed hospital treatment.

Previously, 16 _Listeria_ infections were noted in 2 weeks in the 2 areas of Spain. Health authorities reported 12 listeriosis cases in Seville and 4 in Huelva with 4 people needing hospital treatment.

It can take up to 70 days after exposure to _Listeria_ for symptoms of listeriosis to develop. Symptoms of infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache and neck stiffness.

Pregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people who have weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of serious illnesses, life-threatening infections and other complications. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flulike symptoms, their infections can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth.

The Ministry of Health and Families has issued a health alert on Thursday [15 Aug 2018] and has withdrawn from the sale and consumption a meatloaf manufactured in Seville, with the commercial name La Mecha, which has caused an outbreak of listeriosis that has affected 40 people.

In the last 3 weeks, 40 cases of listeriosis have been recorded in the provinces of Seville and Malaga. Some of these people were hospitalized. As reported by the Ministry, the alert has been issued after verifying that this product, manufactured by the Magrudis firm, domiciled in Seville, is the causative agent of the listeriosis outbreak. The health alert, activated after the development of the protocols and the appropriate inspections, means the withdrawal of said product from the sale and consumption.

The company that manufactures this meat, which according to the Ministry has maintained a close collaboration with Public Health during the investigation, has already communicated these facts to its clients.

The meat company La Mecha reported on Thursday [15 Aug 2019] that it has found anomalies in some items: "After having detected anomalies in the preparation of some batches of our product, Mecha meat, La Mecha brand, we communicate that said product should not be consumed by our customers or final consumers."

Listeriosis is an infection caused by bacteria that may be present in uncooked meats. It causes fever and acute gastroenteritis, and is especially serious in cases of pregnant women, children and people with previous pathologies. The services of the Virgen del Rocio, Macarena and Juan Ramon Jimenez hospitals are attentive to the occurrence of possible cases of this disease.

[Huelva, with a population of 144 258 residents, is a city located along the Gulf of Cadiz coast in southwestern Spain in the autonomous community of Andalusia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huelva). Seville, with a metropolitan population of about 1.5 million, is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Andalusia, located about 80 km (50 mi) inland from the Gulf of Cadiz coast (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville). A map showing the location of Huelva and Seville can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Seville,+Spain.

The 1st news report above does not specify the type of meat involved in the listeriosis outbreak in Seville and Huelva, Spain, although the 2nd news report above says that it is a "meatloaf". Elsewhere it has been characterized as "shredded meat" (https://www.diariodesevilla.es/sevilla/listeriosis-Empresa-retira-mechada-investiga-contaminacion_0_1382861952.html). Adequate cooking of the meat before eating should have markedly reduced the risk for listeriosis. However, refrigerated ready-to-eat cold cut meats are well-recognized sources for listeriosis. Even if initial contamination added only a few _Listeria_ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods because _Listeria monocytogenes_ can subsequently multiply at refrigerator temperatures to sufficient number to cause disease. This type of meat product should not be served to people who are likely to be at increased risk for listeriosis, such as pregnant women, adults aged 65 years or older, and people with weakened immune systems.

The meat ("La Mecha" made by the company Magrudis, based in Seville) suspected to be the source has been recalled, but because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to _Listeria_ for symptoms of listeriosis to develop, more cases may be expected.

In the USA and Europe, clusters of related cases are identified based on clinical isolates of _L. monocytogenes_ that have similar genotypes. Food is confirmed to be the source if _Listeria_ isolated from it has a genotype that matches the genotype of the clinical outbreak strain. We await further developments in the investigation of this outbreak. - Mod.ML
