Detection of the first BSE case on the Canary Islands
---------------------------------------------------
Sources from the Department of Health and Consumer Affairs of the
government of the Canary Islands informed the EFE news agency yesterday
that the first case of "mad cow disease" registered in the archipelago had
been confirmed. The disease was detected in a cow from a cattle farm in the
locality of El Dragonal, in Palmas de Gran Canaria. The affected animal,
already slaughtered, was born in 1998. The diseased animal was discovered
during a routine inspection of a private farm with 1000 head of cattle.
The movement of the animals has been restricted as a precautionary measure.
The inspection was carried out on 3 Jul 2003 and, after determining that
the animal was affected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the
health department decided to send the test results to the reference center
of the health ministry in Getafe (Madrid), which confirmed the initial
diagnosis. The results were also sent to the reference center for
spongiform encephalopathies in Zaragoza, which provided a second
confirmation of the diagnosis.
Following these results, the health department decided to quarantine 1000
head of cattle from the farm where the diseased animal was detected, and to
intensify the sanitary controls that will be carried out in the said farm,
in order to detect any other possible existing cases.

[The age of the (clinically) affected cow is indicative of the fact that
BSE-contaminated animal feeds were used on the Canary Islands at least as
late as 1998. This agrees with observations on mainland Spain: out of 49
BSE cases reported during 2003 so far, 6 were born in 1998. A BSE case born
in 1999 was recorded there in 2002; see:
<http://www.eeb.es/pags/espana.htm#2003>.
Spain is one of the 5 countries with the largest number of adult cattle
within the EU (in millions): France (11.0), Germany (6.2), UK (4.9.), Italy
and Spain (3.4 each). - Mod.AS]
