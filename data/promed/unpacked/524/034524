Younger children with influenza A (H1N1) may have longer viral
shedding than older children and adults
-------------------------
Influenza A (H1N1) virus was detected by real time reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] in patients up to 13
days after onset of fever, according to results presented at the 47th
Annual Meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The
results were presented by Achuyt Bhattarai, MD, an Epidemic
Intelligence Service Officer at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC).

The researchers conducted a telephone survey to identify elementary
school students or household contacts of elementary school students
with influenza-like illness onset within 7 days of the survey. The
study was conducted in May - June 2009 in Pennsylvania. Among 36
specimens from students or contacts with influenza-like illness, 26
were identified as having influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus
infection by real-time RT-PCR tests. Specimens were also tested by
viral culture for the presence of H1N1 virus. Further analysis by
real-time PCR determined that the median duration of viral shedding
was 6 days (range 1-13 days) after the onset of fever. Further
analysis by culture determined that the median duration that viable
H1N1 was detected was 5 days (range 1-7 days) after the onset of
fever. Real-time PCR detected virus for a median of 3 days following
the resolution of fever. Virus was detected by culture an average of 2
days after the resolution of fever.

"In our study, younger children were observed to have prolonged viral
shedding, as compared to older children and adults, which is
consistent with earlier studies of seasonal influenza," Bhattarai
said. "However, I would like to emphasize that the results of our
study should be interpreted carefully, because detection of virus may
not mean that patients are likely to transmit the virus to others.

"This was one of the 1st studies to determine the duration of viral
shedding during the current pandemic and one of the 1st among
children," Bhattarai said.
