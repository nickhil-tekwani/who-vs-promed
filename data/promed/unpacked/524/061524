Kyrgyzstan officials on Tuesday, 27 Aug 2013, scrambled to control the spread of bubonic plague that killed a rural boy last week as 3 more people showed possible symptoms of the disease. The easternmost district of Ak-Suu [Issyk Kul province] in the Central Asian country was on lockdown while police guarded the hospitals where 15-year-old was treated and died last Thursday, 22 Aug 2013. The emergency ministry said that 3 more people from the same village as the victim were hospitalized Tuesday, 27 Aug 2013, suspicion of being infected with the deadly disease.

"Residents of Sary-Kamysh [Ak-Suu]... came to the hospital at 12:30 am," the ministry said in a statement. "They are now under medical care."
The 3 new patients, a woman with a toddler, and a teenager, exhibited symptoms of bubonic plague, namely a fever and swollen lymph nodes in their armpit and neck areas, an informed Kyrgyzstan government source told AFP on condition of anonymity. "They had contact with the deceased 15-year-old," the source said. The health ministry however denied that any new patients have been infected.

A herdboy from the village of Ichke-Zhergez [Ak-Suu], is thought to have become infected after being bitten by a flea carried by a marmot that he reportedly prepared for food. Officials had isolated 131 people as of Tuesday, 27 Aug 2013, to prevent the possible spread of the disease, said Asylbek Sydykanov, the ministry's public health official.

Emergency officials have also gone door to door in the boy's village to look for possible victims of the infection, but did not find signs of the disease, the emergency ministry said.

The Ak-Suu district, which borders Kazakhstan and China, lies close to the Issyk-Kul Lake and is a popular tourist destination.

Kazakhstan said that it is stepping up preventive measures to stop any possible outbreak on its territory, introducing "special monitoring" of people crossing the border from Kyrgyzstan. Kazakhstan's health ministry also warned its citizens against travelling to Kyrgyzstan "until the epidemiological situation regarding the plague is stabilized".

[The description of the patients thought to have been infected by exposure to the initial, fatal case is that of classical bubonic plague spread by bites of infected fleas, not pneumonic plague which can be transmitted directly from person-to-person. It is therefore likely to be the case that the other cases were also acquired from flea bites and not from exposure to the teenager who died. The death is likely to have been caused by septicemia from the infection or pneumonia.

Death from bubonic plague occurs after the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ escapes from the infected bubo into the bloodstream (septicemic plague) causing the manifestations of the sepsis syndrome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with subsequent cutaneous hemorrhage may well have been what was called the 'Black Death' in the Middle Ages. The bacterium can spread to the lungs, causing a secondary plague pneumonia (secondary to the bacteremia), or to the meninges, causing a plague meningitis. Both of these events have a high case fatality rate and the secondary plague pneumonia is the way the infection spreads (by aerosol) from person to person.

The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being infected.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. About 14 per cent (1 in 7) of all plague cases in the United States are fatal.

The marmot is the most common reservoir for _Yersinia pestis_ in eastern Asia. The etymology of the term "marmot" is uncertain (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot). It may have arisen from the Gallo-Romance prefix marm-, meaning to mumble or murmur (an example of onomatopoeia). Another possible origin is post-classical Latin, mus montanus, meaning "mountain mouse". Marmots are hunted for their food and fur, and hunters get bitten by their infected fleas, or infected from their blood when skinning them.
