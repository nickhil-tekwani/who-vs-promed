[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Over the past 4 days, 6 more Ebola cases have been confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), raising the outbreak total to 3043, including 2035 deaths. Officials are still tracking 327 suspected cases of the viral illness.

According to the most recent reports from the DRC's multisector Ebola response committee (CMRE), cases in the past few days have come from Kalunguta and hot spots in Ituri province.

The cases were confirmed during a weekend of unrest throughout the outbreak region, including Kalunguta, where a motorcycle was burned and several people clashed with local Ebola response agents who were attempting to perform a safe and dignified burial for a patient. According to translated media reports, the conflict began when family members protested the declaration of the deceased as an Ebola patient.

In the latest update from the World Health Organization's (WHO's) African regional office, the WHO says the new "hot spot" status of Kalunguta is highly worrisome. "A review of key performance indicators at week 34 (19--25 Aug 2019) shows, in comparison with the previous week, an increase in the number of new confirmed cases, a decrease in the proportion of deaths on notification, persistence of the low proportion of new confirmed cases listed as contacts and an extension of affected health areas," the WHO said. "All these, along with the addition of Kalunguta as a hot spot area, are of grave concern."

Transmission rates have fluctuated in the most recent 3 weeks, with an increasing trend seen in the last half of August, the WHO said. Beni still saw the most Ebola activity in the past 21 days, followed by Kalunguta and Mandima.

In other news, the WHO's regional office also offered more details about a 9-year-old girl who died from Ebola in Uganda late last week. The girl was from Rubiriha Mazango, DRC, and presented (accompanied by her mother) to the health checkpoint in Mpondwe border crossing on 28 Aug 2019 with a high fever and other symptoms, the WHO said. The girl died on 30 Aug 2019, and her body was repatriated to the DRC for a safe and dignified burial. Her mother and siblings have also returned to the DRC and are being followed closely.

The WHO said the girl had been sick for most of [August 2019], and in the middle of the month shared a room with an Ebola patient in a healthcare facility. Immediately prior to traveling to Uganda, the girl had been seen at another health facility in the DRC.

Uganda does not anticipate any more Ebola cases connected to this patient, the WHO said.

[The report states that the girl had been sick for most of August, and in the middle of the month shared a room with an Ebola patient in a healthcare facility. There has been little if any discussion of the ETC serving as the source of the girl's infection. It is not clear the girl had Ebola before entering the facility; we only know she was sick. This is a situation where a point-of-care assay would have been very helpful and possibly have saved her life. - Mod.LK]

Health officials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) confirmed 6 more Ebola infections, raising the overall outbreak total to 3049, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) online dashboard today. Also, outbreak responders are still investigating 327 suspected cases.

Ten more people died from their infections, raising the fatality count to 2045.

In an update today the DRC's multisector Ebola response committee (CMRE) said the 3 cases reported yesterday [Tue 3 Sep 2019] were in Kalunguta, Mandima, and Mambasa. It also noted the addition of 4 more probable cases, 2 each in Butembo and Kalunguta, raising the overall number of probable infections to 109.

Of 6 deaths reported yesterday [Tue 3 Sep 2019], 2 occurred in the community: one in Kalunguta and one in Mandima.

No new health worker infections were reported, keeping the total at 156, and the number of people who have received the VSV-EBOV vaccine has reached 211 635.

Meanwhile, UNICEF said yesterday [Tue 3 Sep 2019] that most schools in the Ebola-affected area of the DRC have reopened for the start of the new school year. It said there are 2 million children living in communities affected by Ebola and that, of 6509 primary and secondary schools, 3800 of them are in high-risk areas.

Fati Bagna Seyni, UNICEF's education lead, said in a news release yesterday [Tue 3 Sep 2019] that the Ebola outbreak was still new when school started last year [2018]. He said many parents were afraid that students could be infected in class and that teachers lacked information and training on how to educate children about the disease and help vulnerable children.

Over the past year, however, he said UNICEF has worked with the DRC's education ministry to deliver assistance to schools, teachers, parents, and students, including thermometers, hygiene supplies, and handwashing stations. It has also trained school administrators and teachers on topics ranging from prevention steps to basic case management.

1. Situation update
[Date of issue: 3 Sep 2019]
Data as reported by: 1 Sep 2019
-3036 Cases
-2035 Deaths

In the past week, from 26 Aug -- 1 Sep, 59 new confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases, with an additional 45 deaths, have been reported from 7 health zones in 3 affected provinces in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

In the 21 days from 12 Aug -- 1 Sep 2019, 58 health areas in 17 health zones reported new cases, (Table 1, Figure 2). During this period, a total of 193 confirmed cases were reported, with the majority coming from the health zones of Beni (20%, n=39), Kalunguta (15%, n=28), and Mandima (12%, n=23). The incidence of new cases in Beni Health Zone has improved, with 7 new cases reported in the last week, compared to up to 48 new cases per week observed 5 weeks ago.

Mambasa Health Zone, however, continues to show signs of an emerging hotspot, with 19 reported cases in the past 21 days in 5 health areas. In addition, sustained local transmission has been observed in Mutwanga Health Zone, with 13 cases reported in the last 21 days (Table 1). This health zone borders Uganda's Kasese District and the shores of Lake Edward, posing added risks of spread within the region.
This risk was highlighted this week by the confirmation of a case in Uganda on 29 Aug 2019. The case was a young child who was exposed and developed symptoms in Mutwanga Health Zone, before she was identified at the Mpondwe-Kasindi border point of entry (PoE) when travelling with her mother to seek medical care. The case was immediately transported to an Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) in Bwera, Uganda. While a limited number of potential contacts are currently under surveillance, there have not been any further cases confirmed in Uganda to date.

Two additional cases have been reported in South Kivu's Mwenga Health Zone, bringing the total to 6 confirmed cases since 15 Aug 2019. These new cases were from individuals who were under surveillance, and they were able to quickly receive care when they became ill. As of 1 Sep 2019, a total of 3036 EVD cases were reported, including 2931 confirmed and 105 probable cases, of which 2035 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases with reported sex and age, 58% (1763) were female, and 28% (857) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (156) were healthcare workers.

Under Pillar 1 of the current Strategic Response Plan, the estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July to December 2019 is USD 287 million, including USD 120--140 million for WHO. As of 27 Aug 2019, USD 45.3 million have been received by WHO, with further funds committed or pledged. Current available funds will close the financing gap up until the end of September 2019.

Further resources are needed to fund the response through to December 2019 and WHO is appealing to donors to provide generous support. A summary of funding received by WHO since the start of this outbreak can be found [in a link in the URL above.]

[Foreign Affairs (abridged, edited)]

[Byline: Laura Seay]

Two experimental drugs used to treat the Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are working, medical researchers say. Infected people who took the medications as part of a trial survived at rates of 66-71%, compared with 30% for those who were not vaccinated and did not receive medication;90% of patients who received treatment within the 1st days of showing symptoms survived. These therapies have the potential to transform Ebola from a near-certain death sentence into a difficult but survivable disease.

Congo especially stands to benefit. The country has experienced 10 Ebola outbreaks since 1976, and its health authorities are adept at identifying and isolating infected individuals, tracing and monitoring exposure networks, and controlling the spread of the virus. But as the current outbreak in the eastern province of North Kivu has shown, no amount of medical preparedness can overcome the difficulties of fighting an outbreak under conditions of insecurity.

The new drug therapies alone can't stop this or any future epidemic. Eradicating Ebola in Congo will require building public trust among Congolese and working with community organizations in order to reach vulnerable populations and overcome governance issues.

Insecurity has hastened the spread of the disease. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, a Geneva-based group that tracks people who flee their homes but stay in their country, more than 3 million Congolese are currently displaced as a result of conflict, and 1.8 million were newly displaced in 2018 alone. Another 850 000 Congolese are refugees in other African countries, according to the United Nations. All this movement raises the risk of Ebola transmission and increases the difficulty health officials encounter in determining who may have come into contact with the virus. ...-more

Published: 4 Sep 2019 DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(19)30313-5

Summary
-------
Background
A record number of people survived Ebola virus infection in the 2013-16 outbreak in west Africa, and the number of survivors has increased after subsequent outbreaks. A range of post-Ebola sequelae have been reported in survivors, but little is known about subsequent mortality. We aimed to investigate subsequent mortality among people discharged from Ebola treatment units.

Methods
From 8 Dec 2015, Surveillance Active en ceinture, the Guinean national survivors' monitoring programme, attempted to contact and follow-up all survivors of Ebola virus disease who were discharged from Ebola treatment units. Survivors were followed up until 30 Sep 2016, and deaths up to this time point were recorded. Verbal autopsies were done to gain information about survivors of Ebola virus disease who subsequently died, from their closest family members. We calculated the age-standardised mortality ratio compared with the general Guinean population, and assessed risk factors for mortality using survival analysis and a Cox proportional hazards regression model.

Findings
Of the 1270 survivors of Ebola virus disease who were discharged from Ebola treatment units in Guinea, information was retrieved for 1130 (89%). Compared with the general Guinean population, survivors of Ebola virus disease had a more than 5-times increased risk of mortality up to 31 Dec 2015 (age-standardised mortality ratio 5•2 [95% CI 4•0-6•8]), a mean of 1 year of follow-up after discharge. Thereafter (ie, from Jan 1-30 Sep 2016), mortality did not differ between survivors of Ebola virus disease and the general population (0•6 [95% CI 0•2-1•4]). Overall, 59 deaths were reported, and the cause of death was tentatively attributed to renal failure in 37 cases, mostly on the basis of reported anuria. Longer stays (ie, equal to or longer than the median stay) in Ebola treatment units were associated with an increased risk of late death compared with shorter stays (adjusted hazard ratio 2•62 [95% CI 1•43-4•79]).

Interpretation
Mortality was high in people who recovered from Ebola virus disease and were discharged from Ebola treatment units in Guinea. The finding that survivors who were hospitalised for longer during primary infection had an increased risk of death, could help to guide current and future survivors' programmes and in the prioritization of funds in resource-constrained settings. The role of renal failure in late deaths after recovery from Ebola virus disease should be investigated.
