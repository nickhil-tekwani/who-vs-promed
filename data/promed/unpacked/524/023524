Scientists have discovered a previously unknown species of Ebola virus, called _Bombali ebolavirus_, that's carried by at least 2 species of bats in Sierra Leone. This is the 1st Ebola virus species detected in a healthy animal before having been detected in sick animals or humans.

Although researchers believe the virus is capable of infecting humans, it's unclear if it would cause disease.

The _Bombali ebolavirus_ joins the 5 already-known Ebola virus species: _Zaire ebolavirus_, _Bundibugyo ebolavirus_, _Sudan ebolavirus_, _Taï Forest ebolavirus_, and _Reston ebolavirus_. Of those 5, all except the _Reston ebolavirus_ are known to cause severe and often fatal disease in humans.

The most devastating Ebola outbreak in recent history was caused by the _Zaire ebolavirus_ and lasted from 2013 to 2016 in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. In that time, more than 28 000 people were infected with Ebola and 11 325 died. And the current Ebola outbreak, which started in early August [2018] in the North Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of Congo, is also caused by the _Zaire ebolavirus_, according to the World Health Organization.

The source of Ebola viruses has been tricky for scientists to pin down, even after 4 decades of research. (The virus was discovered in 1976, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) The reservoir, or organism that the viruses naturally live and reproduce in, is still unknown. Previous research has made a strong case that bats are the primary reservoir species, but until now, scientists have been unable to isolate and recover a complete Ebola virus genome from bats.

So, in an effort to identify Ebola viruses in their host species before the virus spreads to humans, scientists with the US Agency for International Development's (USAID) PREDICT Ebola Host Project collected biological samples from 535 animals in Sierra Leone -- 244 bats, 46 rodents, 240 dogs, and 5 cats -- and tested them for the presence of Ebola viruses.

The PREDICT Ebola Host Project team processed samples collected safely and humanely from bats in the field. The team is active in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia, where they are sampling wildlife and domestic animals to learn more about potential host species for Ebola viruses.

"If you want to prevent Ebola outbreaks, it's important to know which species are hosts and can shed the virus," Tracey Goldstein, co-lead study author and an associate director of the One Health Institute at the University of California, Davis, said in a statement. "Then, we can help target changes in behavior [in those animals], so we can protect people that is the overarching goal of our work."

In the study, the scientists found 4 bats that tested positive for an Ebola virus; all other animals tested negative. These bats were captured inside 3 human dwellings within 12 mi (approx. 20 km) of one another, where livestock and crops were being raised for local consumption. Of these bats, 3 were little free-tailed bats (_Chaerephon pumilus_) and one was an Angolan free-tailed bat (_Mops condylurus_). Both species are widely distributed across Africa and often roost together.

When the team sequenced the genome of the bat-dwelling Ebola virus, the researchers found that the virus was different enough from previously identified Ebola viruses to represent a new species. The researchers named the new species after the location where they first detected it: the Bombali district of Sierra Leone.

Although the _Bombali ebolavirus_ has been detected only in bats thus far, the scientists identified a binding protein that would facilitate the transfer of the virus into human cells, suggesting that human infection is possible. But even if the virus is able to infect humans, there's no evidence that it will cause any symptoms. It's unclear whether the _Bombali ebolavirus_ will behave more like the _Reston ebolavirus_, which doesn't cause disease in humans, or the _Zaire ebolavirus_, which causes severe disease.

The authors of the study pointed out that the purpose of their work is not to incite panic or a fear of bats. These animals play an important role in the ecosystem as insectivores, pollinators and seed dispersers, the authors wrote. Previous studies showed that killing bats doesn't reduce disease transmission but instead can increase the number of susceptible bats and enhance disease transmission.

The researchers published their findings [on 27 Aug 2018] in the journal Nature Microbiology [see reference below].

[Promed regrets the delay in receipt of this report. Although this article was published on 27 Aug 2018 and corrected on 8 Nov 2018, with the current outbreak of Ebola virus in the northeastern area of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the discovery of a new Ebola-related virus will be of interest to ProMED-mail readers. With the virus receptors for human cells and presence of the bats in human residences, one wonders if exposures might have taken place. It would be of interest to know if people living in the same houses with the bats have antibodies to _Bombali ebolavirus_. If there are human seropositive with no history of disease, that would suggest that this virus is less virulent to humans than _Zaire ebolavirus_, _Bundibugyo ebolavirus_, _Sudan ebolavirus_, _Taï Forest ebolavirus_ and more like _Reston virus_.

Abstract
--------
Here we describe the complete genome of a new ebolavirus, _Bombali virus_ (BOMV) detected in free-tailed bats in Sierra Leone (little free-tailed (_Chaerephon pumilus_) and Angolan free-tailed (_Mops condylurus_). The bats were found roosting inside houses, indicating the potential for human transmission. We show that the viral glycoprotein can mediate entry into human cells. However, further studies are required to investigate whether exposure has actually occurred or if BOMV is pathogenic in humans.

Abstract
--------
Putatively named _Bombali ebolavirus_ was identified in organs and excreta of an Angolan free-tailed bat (_Mops condylurus_) in Kenya. Complete genome analysis revealed 98% nucleotide sequence similarity to the prototype virus from Sierra Leone. No Ebola virus-specific RNA or antibodies were detected from febrile humans in the area who reported contact with bats.

[Results]
We identified Bombali virus in an adult female bat (B241) by reverse transcription PCR and next-generation sequencing. This bat was captured along with 15 others in a mist net in savannah habitat near a small river in May 2018; only this bat was Bombali virus positive; (6% prevalence). Viral RNA was present in lung, spleen, liver, heart, intestine, mouth swab, and fecal samples but absent from the brain, kidney, urine, and a few fleas found on the bat; viral loads were especially high in the lung (Appendix). These tissue-positive findings confirm that Bombali virus can infect _M. condylurus_ and is not an artifact of its insect diet, which could not be discounted from the previous analysis on the basis of mouth and fecal swabs (2). We also screened lung samples of sympatric _C. pumilus_ bats (n = 13) and other bat species (Appendix Table 2) captured from the same area in February 2016 and May 2018; results they were negative for Bombali virus RNA. Serologic analysis revealed antibodies against Ebola virus in the blood of the tissue-positive bat (Appendix Figure), but specific antibodies were not found in blood from the other bats (Appendix).

[Discussion]
Our tissue-positive findings provide a strong host association between Bombali virus and _M. condylurus_; it is possible that Bombali virus-positive findings from other bat species result from local spillover or contamination. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of the full Bombali virus genome from the bat lung revealed 98% nucleotide sequence similarity with the prototype reported in Sierra Leone (GenBank accession no. MK340750) (Figure 2). Considering the high sequence similarity between the 2 locations and that _M. condylurus_ bats, like most insectivorous bats, are believed to travel only short distances (8), Bombali virus is likely to be distributed throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa (7). However, further monitoring of _M. condylurus_ and _C. pumilus_ bats and other sympatric species across Africa is required to support this hypothesis.

_M. condylurus_ bats commonly roost in human structures, such as house roofs (8,9), creating greater potential for human exposure than for many other bat species. Therefore, we screened for markers of human infection with Bombali virus by studying serum samples collected from febrile patients who sought treatment at clinics in the Taita Hills area during April-August 2016. Clinics are located in the surrounding areas, all within 15 km [approx. 9 mi] of the Bombali virus-infected bat collection site (Figure 1). We screened patients for filovirus RNA (n = 81) and Ebola virus-specific IgG (n = 250) by an immunofluorescence assay using Zaire Ebola virus VP40-transfected VeroE6 cells as antigen (Appendix). Many samples, including all those screened for filovirus RNA, were from patients who reported contact with bats in the home or workplace. We found no evidence of filovirus infection by either screening method, providing no support that Bombali virus easily infects humans or is a common cause of febrile illness in the area. Ongoing surveillance is nonetheless necessary, and we cannot exclude the possibility that Bombali virus was a recent introduction to the Taita Hills area.

Our results markedly expand the distributional range of this new Ebola virus to eastern Africa and confirm _M. condylurus_ as a competent host. Like Goldstein et al. (2), we stress that the virus is not known to infect humans, a premise supported by our screening of febrile patients in the Taita Hills area. Potential efforts to eradicate bats are unwarranted and may jeopardize their crucial ecosystem roles and human health (10,11). [See references in the original URL. - CopyEd.AO]

[The observations provided by the above study indicate that _Bombali ebolavirus_ is very widely distributed across Sub-Saharan Africa. Interestingly, despite the findings with the Sierra Leone virus of the ability to enter into human cells, the Kenya study found no serological evidence of human infection in the localities where the positive bat was found. One hopes that the findings of these 2 studies will elicit additional studies in these countries and others across Africa to determine if bat species other than _M. condylurus_, as well as humans, are infected by this virus with or without resulting disease. It would also be interesting to screen parasitic bat flies taken from positive bats for the virus. - Mod.TY
