Livestock farmers in Kapchemukot location of West Pokot County have raised alarm over rapid spread of a disease they suspect to be goat's plague, also known as peste des petits ruminants (PPR).

Led by chief David Yarang'iro, the farmers appealed to the department of veterinary services to intervene and control the disease, which they said was spreading fast. "We have raised this complaint several times but nothing has been done to control the problem, which is quickly getting out of hand," he said. The chief disclosed that he had personally lost 120 goats in less than a month.

He approximated the number of livestock that have succumbed to the disease to be about 2000 over the last 2 months and expressed fear that the disease might claim more animals if it was not controlled.

In response to the farmers' cry, the department of veterinary services in Kapenguria said they had received the complaints. A veterinary officer confirmed that officers from the department were sampling animals to ascertain the cause of the deaths. "We are already on the ground to assess the magnitude of the problem and ascertain the cause of deaths, but in the meantime, we can not rule out that it is peste des petits ruminants," said the officer.

PPR is an infectious viral disease believed to have originated from West Africa and can kill numerous stocks within a short period.

In June [2013], the county veterinary officer James Merisya expressed optimism that the construction of a meat processing plant at Nasukuta, which is near completion, will help curb spread of infectious diseases transmitted as a result of movement of stock.
