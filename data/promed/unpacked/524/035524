Horse imported from Lebanon positive for glanders
-------------------------------------------------
A horse in the equestrian center St. Jacob in Baettwil, in the Swiss
canton of Solothurn, tested positive for the bacterium _Burkholderia
mallei_. The animal had been recently imported from Lebanon. The farm
is under quarantine.

The pathogen is the causative agent of the disease glanders. Humans
and other mammals may be similarly infected with this pathogen. [The
report includes description of the disease, its clinical signs, and
routes of transmission; for this information, subscribers are referred
to the commentary below. - Mod.AS]

Glanders is a zoonotic disease in humans and if untreated it is often
fatal. Antibiotic therapy takes an extended period and no vaccines are
available. Due to its zoonotic nature, _Burkholderia mallei_ is
counted among class B biological warfare agents [see commentary].

[Though not specified in the report, it may be assumed that the horse
was clinically sound but tested positive to routine mallein test
following its importation. The test used is not specified. A definite
lab result, details of the test applied, details of the animal
involved (a race horse?), and an official notification are
anticipated.

On 11 Jul 2011 Lebanon sent an immediate notification to the OIE
reporting the discovery of glanders in several horses (see ProMED-mail
no. 20110713.2122). From a reliable source we have noted that this
incident was similarly related to transboundary animal movements. A
follow-up report is expected.

The following summary is derived from OIE's terrestrial manual (2008;
chapter 2.5.11 Glanders):

"Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and
mules, and is caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia
mallei_ (the name recently changed from _Pseudomonas mallei_ and was
previously classified as _Pfeifferella_, _Loefflerella_,
_Malleomyces_, or _Actinobacillus_). The disease causes nodules and
ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form also
occurs, known as 'farcy'. Control of glanders requires testing of
suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and
elimination of positive reactors. It is transmitted to humans and all
infected/contaminated or potentially infected/contaminated material
must be handled in a laboratory that meets the requirements for
Containment Group 3 pathogens.

"Identification of the agent
----------------------------
"Smears from fresh material may reveal Gram-negative nonsporulating,
nonencapsulated rods. The presence of a capsule-like cover has been
demonstrated by electron microscopy. The bacteria grow aerobically and
prefer media that contain glycerol. Unlike the _Pseudomonas_ species
and the closely related bacterium _Burkholderia pseudomallei_,
_Burkholderia mallei_ is nonmotile. Guinea pigs are highly
susceptible, and males can be used, if strictly necessary, to recover
the organism from a heavily contaminated sample. Commercially
available biochemical identification kits lack diagnostic sensitivity.
Specific monoclonal antibodies and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as
well as real-time PCR assays are available. The latter have also been
evaluated in recent outbreaks.

"Mallein and serological tests
---------------------------------
The mallein test is a sensitive and specific clinical test for
hypersensitivity against _Burkholderia mallei_. Mallein, a water
soluble protein fraction of the organism, is injected subcutaneously,
intradermo-palpebrally, or given by eyedrop. In infected animals, the
skin or the eyelid swells markedly within 1-2 days. Complement
fixation test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays are the most
accurate and reliable serological tests for diagnostic use. A rose
bengal plate agglutination test has recently been developed in Russia;
it has been validated in Russia only.

"Requirements for vaccines and diagnostic biologicals
-----------------------------------------------------
There are no vaccines. Mallein purified protein derivative is
currently available commercially from the Central Veterinary Control
and Research Institute, 06020 Etlik, Ankara, Turkey."

According to Switzerland's reports to the OIE, glanders has not been
recorded there since 1937.

There are 2 OIE reference laboratories for glanders: in Jena, Germany
and in Dubai, UAE. For details refer to
