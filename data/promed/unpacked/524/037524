Wild birds likely cause of avian flu outbreak
---------------------------------------------
A recent bird flu outbreak was likely caused by droppings from
migrating wild birds rather than from smuggled ones, experts believe.
A government-appointed committee has completed its initial
investigation into the deaths of 200 chickens in a Yuen Long farm
early last month [December 2008], which led to a cull of 100 000
birds and a 21-day ban on the sale of fresh fowl. The report will be
submitted to the Food and Health Bureau this week.

According to a source, the report studied several possible factors
behind the contamination but concluded there was no evidence linking
it to smuggling activities. It was more likely caused by contaminated
feces dropped by migrating birds inside the farm or nearby area, the
report said. It may have stuck onto a worker's garment and was
carried into the farm, it said.

Veterinarians and experts of the Agriculture, Fisheries and
Conservation Department (AFCD) who visited the farm found room for
improvement in some of the biosecurity measures already in place.
They made 10 suggestions to prevent another outbreak.

Another source said biosecurity and vaccines are the 2 most important
things farms need to control in order to prevent bird flu outbreaks.
The source said it was questionable whether all chickens on the farm
were vaccinated, but that trying to identify the real cause of the
infection was challenging since much of the evidence had been lost
during the cull. The owner, Wong Yee-chuen, said the farm is still
being sanitized and cannot resume operations until the government is
satisfied with the hygiene conditions.

The AFCD suggested that a metal cover be built for the chicken houses
to avoid droppings of migrating birds. It also suggested workers
change gloves when handling different lots of chickens to prevent
cross contamination. Wong said he welcomed all suggestions made by
the committee as long as they were viable and reasonable. Workers,
from now on, will wear thin plastic gloves on top of cotton ones. He
said the outbreak and the aftermath has cost him HKD 2 million to HKD
3 million [USD 257 949 to USD 386 934].

12 Dec 2008: Highly pathogenic avian influenza, Hong Kong (P.R.
China), (Immediate notification)
29 Dec 2008: Highly pathogenic avian influenza, Hong Kong (P.R.
China), (Follow-up report No. 1)
Unfortunately at this point we have only the apparent conclusions of
the investigating team. From other information it seems that the
"migrating birds" may have been sparrows:

As sparrows do not migrate but are essentially resident in an area or
set of buildings, they therefore merely reflect the neighbourhood
level of exposure and risk. We must await a more authoritative report
on this investigation. HPAI has been a problem in Hong Kong since
April 2001. - Mod.MHJ]
