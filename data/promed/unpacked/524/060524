By the end of February 2011, New Caledonia faced its 1st
autochthonous case of chikungunya (see ProMED-mail archive number 20110308.0759).

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is transmitted to human by the bite of
_Aedes_ mosquitoes. Symptoms of CHIKV infection include mainly acute
fever associated with severe joint pain. Since the 2005-2006 epidemic
that occurred in the Indian Ocean Islands (Reunion, Madagascar,
Seychelles), outbreaks of chikungunya re-emerged in India, Malaysia,
and Thailand. Phylogenetic analyses have demonstrated 3 distinct
lineages of CHIKV strains: West Africa, Asia, and East/Central/South
Africa (ECSA). Strains from Indian Ocean Islands presumably derive
from the ECSA group. The analysis of E1 gene sequences from strains of
Indian Ocean Islands indicated the substitution of an alanine to
valine in position 226 (E1-A226V). This substitution enhanced the
transmissibility of CHIKV by _Aedes albopictus_ (shortening of
extrinsic incubation period and increased replication rate of the
virus within the vector) in Indian Ocean Islands, secondly in Asia and
even in Europe (Italy). This key evolutionary event has contributed to
the transmission and spatial distribution of CHIKV in these regions.

In New Caledonia, the putative vector of CHIKV is _Aedes aegypti_
since _Ae. albopictus_ has never been described there. Sequence
analysis of E1 gene of the 1st New Caledonian autochthonous isolate of
CHIKV has been conducted by the National Reference Centre of
Arbovirus, WHO collaborating Centre, Institut Pasteur, Paris. The New
Caledonia/2011 CHIKV strain has alanine at position E1-226.
Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that this viral isolate belongs to
the Asia lineage, which corroborates the Indonesian origin of the
imported cases (ProMED-mail Archive Number 20110226.0631).

Further investigations are currently in progress to assess the risk
of a chikungunya epidemic in New Caledonia.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Dupont-Rouzeyrol and colleagues for sending in
this interesting analysis of the CHIKV isolates from New Caledonia.
This is an excellent illustration of application of molecular
genotyping to an understanding of virus movement in human
populations.

It would be interesting to know how the _Aedes aegypti_ control
efforts are progressing on New Caledonia, since that is an essential
component of epidemic risk.
