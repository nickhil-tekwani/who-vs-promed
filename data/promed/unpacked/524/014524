Luis Mar Serrano, director of the Epidemiology department of Sanitary
Jurisdiction No. IV of the Health Secretariat, reported that the National
Reference Institute of Epidemiology confirmed a horse died in August 2002
from WNV infection in Ciudad Victoria, where it had been for 15 days since
being transported from the frontier [with Texas, USA] township of Rio
Bravo, Tamaulipas state.

[This is the first report ProMED has seen of not-unexpected horse infection
with WNV in Mexico. Note it occurred last year. - Mod.JW]
[During the course of 2002 there were 1597 confirmed cases of West Nile
virus infection of horses in Texas (10.9 percent of the total for the USA).
Consequently the occurrence of a West Nile virus-positive equine case in
the border region is not unexpected. - Mod.CP]
