Measles in Victoria Australia
An outbreak of measles in Victoria is now entering its fourth week with 48
laboratory confirmed cases to date and new cases continuing to occur. The
index case was a female adolescent recently returned from Bali, Indonesia.
Fourteen subsequent cases have had known exposure to this index case, most
as patrons of a cinema where the index case sold tickets. Additional cases
have occurred among their contacts. All but four cases have been in the age
range 18-27 years. There have been 16 hospitalisations. Of concern is the
number of cases among health care workers: 1 doctor, 2 nurses and 1 social
worker.
Urine, throat and nose swabs and peripheral blood leucocytes have been
obtained from almost every case for detection of virus. All 16 cases whose
specimens have been tested to date by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
have been positive using primers targetting the nucleoprotein gene (Rota et
al 1994 Virology 198: p724-730). Of these 11 have been sequenced so far,
and 4 of these have been analysed. All are genotype D5 which appeared in
Victoria for the first time in 1998 and had been detected in January 1999,
prior to this outbreak, in a Victorian returned traveler from Bali. Further
PCR and sequencing and results of viral culture are pending.
The Department of Human Services Victoria is making free MMR vaccine
available for those in the 18-30 year age group who do not have
documentation of receipt of at least one dose of measles containing vaccine
or a definite history of measles. At risk health care workers have also
been advised to check their immunisation status.
