The Institute of Public Health confirmed the 1st case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the O'Higgins region in a 7-year-old boy, a resident of the San Vicente community in Tagua Tagua.

The child is hospitalized in the Fusat clinic in Rancagua, in the intermediate unit in pediatrics.

According to the background given by the institution, the child currently is in good health condition, and now currently is not on mechanical ventilation and is without fever.

[The above report indicates that the boy is no longer on mechanical ventilation or has fever. That implies that he had been and was febrile. If so, this is a case of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. As noted in previous comments, much of central and southern Chile, including the O'Higgins region, is endemic for Andes hantavirus. The report above provides no information about the circumstances under which the boy acquired his hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta in his environment. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
