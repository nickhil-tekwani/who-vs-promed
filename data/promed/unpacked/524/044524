Toronto: 6 Schools & 8 Hospitals Affected by Viral Gastroenteritis
--------------------------------------------------
At least 6 Toronto schools have been hit by Norwalk virus infection,
prompting the public school board to send letters to parents warning
them to keep their children at home if they show any signs of the
highly contagious pathogen. The absentee rate is about the same as it
was at this time last year, said public school board spokesperson
Jennifer MacIntyre. Schools that have reported children with diarrhea
or vomiting have had extra cleaning, she added.
The outbreak that has so far hit 8 Greater Toronto Area (GTA)
hospitals. Like most GTA hospitals, Toronto General saw sporadic
cases of Norwalk virus infection over the past couple of weeks as
patients made miserable from the virus infection (which lasts 24 to
48 hours) dragged themselves to the emergency room. But that created
a perfect climate for the bug -- riding on microscopic droplets of
vomit, saliva or feces -- to hop from one patient to another and to
staff. "Wave after wave of patients were coming in, 10 to 12 patients
a day, and were getting violently ill in the emergency room," Dr.
Michael Gardam said. By last Sunday, the hospital was so
short-staffed it was becoming impossible to care for patients. "We
had to close. We couldn't, in good conscience, stay open," Gardam
said. Since November 2002, Norwalk virus has hit Sunnybrook hospital,
Mississauga's Credit Valley Hospital, Richmond Hill's York Central,
The Scarborough Hospital, and the Etobicoke and Brampton campuses of
the William Osler Health Centre.
Toronto Public Health reports there are at least 50 outbreaks in the
city. For now, no new patients are being admitted into Toronto
General's emergency ward, where 10 patients are confined until the
outbreak is over. They were receiving treatment when the ER closed
and can't be transferred to another bed for fear of spreading the
virus. Toronto Western and Mount Sinai hospitals were taking
emergency patients who would otherwise go to Toronto General, and
Emergency Medical Services said ambulances were coping with the loss
of an emergency room. The emergency room won't reopen until 2 days
after the last symptom disappears in the last [viral gastroenteritis]
patient.
