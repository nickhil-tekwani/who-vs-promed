A new endemic cluster of _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ infection has appeared
near Melbourne, Australia. The town of Point Lonsdale is a coastal resort,
an approximately one hour drive south of central Melbourne on the Bellarine
Peninsula. 6 infections in visitors or residents of Point Lonsdale have
been diagnosed in the last 2 months [June and July 2004].
Although _M. ulcerans_ has been present on the Bellarine peninsula for the
last 6 years, including some cases from Point Lonsdale, the close temporal
and geographical clustering of these recent cases is a cause for concern. A
similar cluster occurred at a nearby town, St. Leonards, in 2001. A team of
health department officials and researchers are about to visit the area in
an attempt to identify a point source. However, as the incubation period
for _M. ulcerans_ has a median of around 13 weeks, transmission probably
occurred in late summer or autumn 2004. It is now winter in southeastern
Australia, with typical daytime temperatures of 12-14 degrees Celsius
[53-57 degrees Fahrenheit]. _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ infection (also known
as Buruli ulcer) is most prevalent in rural west and sub-Saharan Africa,
and, it is not known why this tropical disease also occurs in temperate
southeastern Australia.
The precise mode of transmission is also unknown, but the endemic areas in
Victoria are, typically, low-lying coastal regions with tidal and/or swampy
features, lakes, or slow flowing rivers. Possible modes of transmission
include, mosquitoes, sand flies, tabanids (March flies), aerosol contact,
or direct contact with contaminated soil or vegetation.
At least 2 other cases of _M. ulcerans_ infection not linked to Point
Lonsdale have been reported to the Victorian Department of Human Services
during 2004. People who live on, or visit, Point Lonsdale, or other known
endemic areas in the state of Victoria -- including east Gippsland, the
Gippsland lakes, Phillip Island, the Mornington peninsula, and the
Bellarine peninsula -- should report unusual slowly progressive skin
lesions to their doctors and ask that the diagnosis of _M. ulcerans_
infection be considered. Treatment is relatively straightforward when the
diagnosis is made early. [The treatment, as discussed below, is primarily
surgical. - Mod.LL]

Rare ulcer outbreak in coastal town
---------------------------------
Victorian health authorities are investigating a suspected outbreak of a
rare ulcer condition in a coastal holiday town.
6 people -- residents of Point Lonsdale on Victoria's Bellarine Peninsula,
and visitors to holiday homes in the area -- have been diagnosed with a
condition known as the Bairnsdale ulcer, the state's chief health officer,
Robert Hall, said today, Thu 15 Jul 2004.
The condition, also known as _Mycobacterium ulcerans_, is a rare infection
that causes chronic, progressive skin ulcer on exposed parts of the body,
such as the arms or legs, Dr. Hall said.
"It can begin as a painless, or itchy, lesion that breaks down to form an
ulcer."
Dr. Hall advised anyone who had a skin sore, lump, or ulcer that was not
healing to contact a doctor for testing.
The Bairnsdale ulcer, which is not thought to be contagious, gets its name
from the local area in which an outbreak among farmers was documented in
1948. Between 5 and 20 cases are reported in Australia each year. The
bacteria are found naturally in the environment, but the way it infects
humans is unknown.

Footy great is among 8 people infected by flesh-eating bacteria
-----------------------------------------------
Doctors are investigating 8 cases of infection by the mysterious
_Mycobacterium ulcerans_ or Bairnsdale ulcer. The latest outbreak of the
disease, which eats away skin, flesh, and fat has again been linked to
Victoria's Bellarine Peninsula. [Although the infection is locally erosive
to the tissues, it does not cause necrotizing fasciitis, the so-called
flesh-eating disease - Mod.LL]
Victoria's chief health officer, Dr. Robert Hall, confirmed that 6 of the 8
victims lived in, or had stayed at, Point Lonsdale. Authorities know the
Bairnsdale ulcer is related to tuberculosis and leprosy, but are unsure
about how it is transmitted to humans.
One of those afflicted is a well-known Australian footballer, who is a
former Hawthorn and Carlton premiership coach. He became infected in a
wound behind his knee.

[The following is part of the WHO fact sheet on this process:
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs199/en/>
"Buruli ulcer, a disease caused by _Mycobacterium ulcerans_, has, since
1980, emerged as an important cause of human suffering. The causative
organism is from the family of bacteria which causes tuberculosis and
leprosy. It destroys skin, underlying tissues, and causes deformities.
Lesions occur mainly in the limbs.
Buruli ulcer is the 3rd most common mycobacterial infection in healthy
people, after tuberculosis and leprosy, and the most poorly understood of
these 3 diseases. It was 1st detected in 1948 among farmers in Australia
(where it is known as Bairnsdale ulcer). However, cases were described, as
early as 1897, in Uganda, by Sir Albert Cook. Most patients are women and
children who live in rural areas near rivers or wetlands. Not much is known
about the mode of transmission to human beings.
Buruli ulcer, named after an area of Uganda that was the site of many cases
in the 1960s, is most common in West Africa. All countries along the Gulf
of Guinea are now affected. In Cote d'Ivoire, approximately 15 000 cases
have been recorded since 1978, where up to 16 percent of the population in
some villages are affected. In Benin, 4000 cases have been recorded since
1989. In Ghana (6000 recorded cases in a national survey in 1999), up to 22
percent of villagers are affected in some areas. There is evidence of huge
under reporting of the disease.
It is found in marshy parts of the tropical and sub-tropical regions of
Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Western Pacific. Cases have been
reported, or suspected, in Angola, Australia, Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso,
Cameroon, China, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo,
Equatorial Guinea, French Guyana, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, India, Indonesia,
Japan, Liberia, Malaysia, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Sierra Leone, Sri
Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Togo, and Uganda. A few cases have been reported in
non-endemic areas in North America and Europe linked to international travel.
The disease often starts as a painless swelling on the skin. A nodule
develops beneath the skin's surface teeming with mycobacteria. Unlike other
mycobacteria, _M. ulcerans_ produces a toxin, which destroys tissue and
suppresses the immune system. Massive areas of skin, and, sometimes bone,
are destroyed causing gross deformities. When lesions heal, scarring may
cause restricted movement of limbs and other permanent disabilities. One
important feature of Buruli ulcer is the minimally painful nature of the
disease, which may partly explain why those affected do not seek prompt
treatment.
Treatment of Buruli ulcer with antibiotics has been unsuccessful to date,
although the organism is sensitive, in vitro, to some of the antibiotics
used for treatment of tuberculosis. Current research findings indicate that
a combination of an aminoglycoside (amikacin or streptomycin) and
rifampicin cures Buruli ulcer in mice. At the present time, the only
treatment available is surgery to remove the lesion, followed by a skin
graft, if necessary. This is both costly and dangerous, leading to the loss
of large amounts of tissue or permanent disability. Early detection, and
surgical removal, of small lesions could prevent many complications.
BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guerin) vaccination appears to offer some short-term
protection from the disease. At present, BCG vaccination is the only
biomedical intervention that may help control Buruli ulcer in the highly
affected areas.
Access to health services is restricted in endemic areas. Patients often
seek treatment late, causing frequent, and severe, complications, and,
prolonging costly hospitalization. Treatment cost per patient far exceeds
annual per capita health spending. In Ghana, the average cost of treatment
is estimated at USD 780 per patient. Alternatively, treatment for early
lesions could cost about USD 20-30 per patient, with very limited
hospitalization. In some areas, about 20-25 percent of people with healed
lesions are disabled. With an increasing number of cases, and associated
complications, the long-term economic and social impact of Buruli ulcer on
rural populations could be substantial." - Mod.LL]
