In a follow-up on the shigellosis outbreak in Eureka, California, Humboldt County Public Health Nurse Daniel Tran reported Friday [4 Mar 2022] that the outbreak in the greater waterfront area has grown to 5 confirmed cases and 11 currently under investigation.

"_Shigella_ is a gastrointestinal bacterium, which is really just a fancy way of saying that it causes diarrhea, upset stomach, gas, and that kind of stuff," Tran said. "Typically, this bacteria is found within a person's feces or stool, and even though that's where it's typically found, you could still spread it if you've made contact with different surfaces that are not clean and disinfected."

_Shigella_ is transmitted by oral ingestion, meaning it must travel into the body through food or drink. The bacteria can come into contact with food and drink through contact with surfaces where the bacteria are located. "That means you do not have to worry about it being transmitted through the air, like if someone sneezed on you or any of that. This is really a surface problem," Tran said.

[In late 2021, an outbreak of shigellosis occurred in San Diego County in Southern California. This increasing cluster is in Humboldt County, which is in the far north of the state.

_Shigella_ was discovered more than 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach because they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10-100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices commoner in men who have sex with men. Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

The bacterium is the classical cause of bacterial dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux), an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing diarrhea). - Mod.LL
