Parasite Outbreak Puts Swimmers At Risk, 9 People Fall Ill, One Hospitalized
-----------------------------------------------
A dangerous parasite prompted the closing of hundreds of Hamilton County
swimming pools on Tuesday [23 Aug 2005], and at least 9 people are already
sick, News 5 reports.
8 children are ill, and an adult has been hospitalized after an outbreak of
cryptosporidosis at Powel Crosley Y.M.C.A. in Springfield Township, health
officials said.
"Crypto" will give you cramps and severe diarrhea that can last up to 2
weeks, or even worse. The local water supply has been tested and given the
all-clear, but Hamilton County health officials are worried that swimmers
could spread the outbreak to other pools, News 5 reports. The bug is spread
by ingesting fecal matter.
The Hamilton County Health Department mailed letters to 320 pool operators,
asking them to put up a "No Swimming" sign for 8 hours and to
super-chlorinate the water. "You can't kill it with normal doses of
chlorine, and that's what we do when we ask people to super-shock their
pools," said Kathy Lordo of the Hamilton County Health Department. At Powel
Crosley, they used 10 times the normal amount of chlorine, just to be sure,
and they cleaned the slides and railings, trying to reassure members.
The symptoms can be tricky, and victims and doctors may not suspect
"crypto." "You can have diarrhea for a day or 2, and it kind of goes off
for a little bit, and it may flare up again," Lordo said.
The best ways to avoid "crypto:" Wash your hands often. Avoid swimming.
Anyone who is infected can be contagious for up to 2 weeks. They are
advised not to swim and not to work in daycare or restaurant facilities
during that time.
