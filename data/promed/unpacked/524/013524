New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks (3)

Outbreak location 1: Boyeros, [Havana]
Started: 14 Jun 2021
Epidemiological unit: Backyard
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Rabbits / 1441 / 511 / 479 / 962 / 0 / 0

Outbreak location 2: Boyeros, [Havana]
Started: 14 Jun 2021
Epidemiological unit: Backyard
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Rabbits / 157 / 21 / 21 / 136 / 0 / 0

Outbreak location 3: Boyeros, [Havana]
Started: 14 Jun 2021
Epidemiological unit: Backyard
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Rabbits / 76 / 69 / 66 / 10 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: All categories have been affected. The animals are vaccinated (Cunipravac and rabbit haemorrhagic septicaemia). Among the clinical signs, there were shrieks, tremors, kicking and sudden death. Epidemiological links between the units have been evidenced due to the fact that they are often in the same areas for fodder cutting and have links for transporting food and other inputs.

Control measures at event level
Control measures applied, domestic: Control of wildlife reservoirs; quarantine; disinfection; disinfestation; official destruction of animal products; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; movement control inside the country; stamping out; traceability; surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone; surveillance outside containment and/or the protection zone

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National Center for Agricultural Health (CENSA) (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Outbreaks / Test date / Result
Rabbits / Histopathological examination / 3 / 17 Jun 2021 / Positive
Rabbits / Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 3 / 17 Jun 2021 / Positive

["Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly contagious and acute fatal hepatitis of the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_), caused by a calicivirus (genus _Lagovirus_). Up to 2010, all RHD viruses (RHDV) isolated belonged to one of the 6 identified genotypes (GI-GVI), among which the GVI is an antigenic subtype (RHDVa). In 2010, an additional RHDV was identified, phylogenetically and antigenically distinct from RHDV and provisionally called RHDV2 or RHDVb. A similar disease, termed European brown hare syndrome (EBHS), has been described in the hare (_Lepus europaeus_).

"RHD is characterised by high morbidity and a mortality of 70-90% for RHDV/RHDVa and 5-70% for RHDV2. Infection mainly occurs by the oral route. In wild rabbits in particular, insects are considered an important route of infection or transmission and are often the source of long-distance spread. The incubation period of RHD varies from one to 3 days, and death usually occurs 12-36 hours after the onset of fever. The main clinical manifestations of the acute infection are nervous and respiratory signs, apathy and anorexia. In rabbits younger than 4-6 weeks, the RHDV/RHDVa infection course is subclinical, but when the causative agent is RHDV2, clinical signs and mortality are observed even in young animals from 15-20 days of age onwards" (Source: OIE Terrestrial Manual 2019, Chapter 3.6.2 Rabbit haemorrhagic disease https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.06.02_RHD.pdf).

"Classical RHDV and/or RHDVa are endemic in some areas with wild European rabbits, including Australia, New Zealand, some islands (e.g., Cuba), parts of Asia and Africa, and most of Europe. Susceptible wild lagomorphs do not exist in most of North America, though feral European rabbits do occur in a few locations. RHDV was found in both domestic and wild rabbits in South America (Uruguay) in 2005, but there are no reports of its occurrence since that time, and Uruguay reported itself to be free of rabbit hemorrhagic disease as of 2012.

"As of 2020, RHDV2 has become established in wild lagomorphs in a number of European countries, Australia and parts of Africa. In some locations, RHDV2 has largely replaced classical RHDV or RHDVa. Outbreaks have also been reported in New Zealand and some countries in the Middle East, Asia and North America, but whether the virus will persist in some of these locations is not yet certain. In North America, this virus was found in both domestic and feral rabbits."

"There is no indication that any lagoviruses infect humans" (Source: Spickler AR. 2020. Rabbit hemorrhagic disease factsheet. Retrieved from https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rabbit_hemorrhagic_disease.pdf). - Mod.CRD
