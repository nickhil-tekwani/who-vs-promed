A duck farm in central France has detected a low-pathogenic H5 bird flu virus, the World Organisation for Animal Health confirmed. The mild strain of the virus was found among a flock of 2600 ducks in Marolle-en-Sologne, Loir-et-Cher administrative department.

In a report, the French agriculture ministry said the free-range ducks are to be culled. It added that the disease was found as part of planned surveillance and the ducks had shown no clinical signs.

It comes as UK poultry farmers and backyard keepers were urged by the government to prepare for winter's avian influenza threat. The chief veterinary officers across the UK are urging for action to be taken now to reduce the risk of disease in their birds over the winter.

No cases of the disease were found in domestic poultry [in the UK], either in commercial or small holdings, last year [2018]. However, the H5N6 strain of avian influenza was confirmed in 21 wild birds between January and June 2018.

The government said it is continuing to monitor for avian flu and is working with the poultry and game bird industries to help prevent incursions.

[The above LPAI H5 event in France has been reported to the OIE in an immediate notification submitted 9 Oct 2019. According to the report, the event, which had started on 3 Oct 2019, involved susceptible mallards kept on a free-ranging farm; the birds were intended for hunting in a natural environment. The farm included 2600 mallards with 4 different batches: ducks ready to be released, breeders to be culled and 2 batches of future breeders. The virus was detected as part of the official planned surveillance without any clinical signs. Neuraminidase could not be determined during confirmation. At the time of report submission, the mallards were alive; stamping out was included among "measures to be applied." The report, with a map presenting the location, is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=32007.

The mallard (_Anas platyrhynchos_) is a dabbling duck that breeds throughout the temperate and subtropical Americas, Eurasia, and North Africa. For a video showing mallard ducks swimming and feeding, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVlq3Ypi2Xg. - Mod.AS
