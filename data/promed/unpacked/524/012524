After reporting a record 31 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) in 2021, Chinese health officials are reporting the first case of 2022 in Guangdong Province.

According to the Guangdong Provincial Health and Health Commission, the patient is a 43-year-old female from Zhongkai District, Huizhou City. The patient is currently in critical condition and is being admitted to a designated hospital in Huizhou. Health authorities were notified of the case on [7 Jan 2022].

Experts believe that the cases that appear this time are sporadic cases, and the risk of transmission of the virus is low at this stage. Experts remind: the public should continue to remain vigilant and take the following measures to prevent H5N6 and other bird flu.

- Wash hands frequently: wash hands after touching birds, before meals and after toileting.
- To be cooked: Poultry and eggs should be cooked before eating.
- Seek medical treatment early: If you have respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, headache, general malaise, etc., seek medical treatment at the nearest medical and health institution as soon as possible. If you have been in contact with birds before, you should take the initiative to tell your doctor.
- Do not eat dead poultry.
- Do not buy poultry products from unknown sources.
- Avoid going to live poultry markets as much as possible.

This is the 58th human H5N6 avian influenza case reported in China since 2014.

[To date, a total of 58 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N6) virus including 27 deaths have been reported to WHO in the Western Pacific Region since 2014. The rise in numbers of reported human cases of A(H5N6) infection may reflect the continued circulation of the virus in birds, and enhanced surveillance system and diagnostic capacity as a direct outcome from the response to the COVID-19 pandemic (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai-20211224.pdf).

The zoonotic threat remains elevated due to the spread of the viruses among birds. However, the overall pandemic risk associated with A(H5) is considered not significantly changed in comparison to previous years. WHO recommends Member States to remain vigilant and consider mitigation steps to reduce human exposure to potentially infected birds to reduce risk of additional zoonotic infections.
