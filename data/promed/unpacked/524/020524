Doses of anti-rabies vaccines are running out in Surigao City at a time when cases of rabies are rising, causing city health officials to worry, a Mindanao news site reported.

City Health Office Animal Bites Treatment Center head Garrote Menor said they cannot give all necessary vaccines to bite victims, according to MindaNews. "We don't have ample supply of these vaccines to give each patient all the necessary vaccines, especially those categorized as level 3," Menor said. Category 3 patients are those bitten near the brain, like in the neck, head and face, she said.

Menor said anti-rabies vaccines cost P 2800 [USD 62.00] per vial, with Category 3 patients needing "at least 3 doses of anti-rabies vaccines." But the city government allocated only P 100 000 [USD 2200] for the anti-rabies vaccines this year [2014], she said.

The CHO recorded at least 1241 cases of animal bites from January to September 2014. Last year [2013], the CHO recorded 1510 animal-bite cases, including 1210 dog bites. Of this year's cases, 973 are dog bites. Some 196 other cases were cat bites, while the rest involved rats, monkeys, and rabbits.

Menor said the CHO is subsidizing the anti-rabies vaccines, with the patients not needing to pay for the 1st dose. But if a dog dies after the bite, the patient needs the 4 complete sessions. Menor said the patient must then buy the vaccine after the 1st dose. "Indigent or not, we give them the vaccine and that is free of charge," she said.

She said the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. also offers free vaccines to its members.

Meanwhile, MindaNews said CHO records show zero incidence of rabies cases from 2008 to 2013 in Surigao City but 4 rabies-related deaths this year [2014] alone.

CHO head Dr. Emmanuel Plandano said his office is short of anti-rabies vaccines. "There are many times that cases of dog bites may reach up to 10 a day," he said.

Menor said the city government will double its budget for anti-rabies vaccines in 2015.

[For a map of the Philippines and Mindanao, go to: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/islands_oceans_poles/philippines.gif. Surigao is in the top NE corner of this province; see: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RP/F9/Surigao.html.

In 2011, the latest year that the Philippines reports any human cases, there were 296 544 reported cases of human rabies with 202 deaths (under one percent case fatality); as recovery from clinical rabies is rare, I think we can presume that the number of "cases" is in relation to bites by "rabid" dogs. There were 361 animal outbreaks reported in 2012, and 300 in January-June 2013; details are scant, but most involved dogs.

Rabies in all its forms is clearly a major problem in the Philippines. A coordinated strategy to annually vaccinate dogs would have an immediate pay off. An efficient urban canine rabies programme can, from my experience with PAHO in Brazil, reduce the number of rabid dogs to zero within 3 years. It has very significant social and community benefits and is very cost effective. Retroactive human vaccination does nothing to reduce the community risk of this disease, though it can skirt the human death that would have occurred without this vaccination. Human vaccination is the most expensive way of dealing with this zoonotic disease. - Mod.MHJ
