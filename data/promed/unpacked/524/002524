SARS: Availability and Use of Laboratory Testing
------------------------------------------------
As of 17 Apr 2003, research workers in several countries are working
towards developing fast and accurate laboratory tests for SARS.
However, until those tests have been adequately field-tested and
shown to be reliable, SARS diagnosis remains dependant on the
clinical findings of an atypical pneumonia not attributed to another
cause and a history of exposure to a suspect or probable case of SARS
or their respiratory secretions and other bodily fluids. This
requirement is reflected in the current WHO case definitions for
suspect or probable SARS. However several countries (Canada, France,
Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, United
Kingdom, and the United States of America) are testing samples for
suspected and probable SARS cases in research settings.
Interpretation of test results
Positive test results: A positive test result indicates that a SARS
patient is, or recently was, infected with the SARS virus. The
specificity of the different tests still needs to be established.
Negative test results: A negative SARS virus test does not mean that
the patient does not have SARS. The reasons for negative test results
in a patient with SARS include the following: (1) The patient is not
infected with the SARS virus; (2) the illness is caused by another
infectious agent (virus, bacterium, fungus) or non-infective cause;
(3) the test results are incorrect ("false-negative") -- current
tests need to be further developed to improve sensitivity; (4)
specimens were not collected at a time when the virus or its genetic
material was present (pertains to PCR and cell culture) -- the virus
and its genetic material may be present for a brief period only,
depending on the type of specimen tested; (5) specimens were
collected early in the course of the illness and before antibodies
had been produced (pertains to ELISA and immunofluorescence assays).
Sampling for research
To enhance the future understanding of the SARS disease process, WHO
recommends that clinicians collect and store sequential samples from
patients with SARS for testing when diagnostic tests become readily
available. This is particularly important for the first case(s)
recognised in countries that have not previously reported SARS.
Guidelines on sample handling of suspected or probable SARS patients
can be found at the website of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), United States of America.
Status of laboratory tests currently under development
(1) Antibody tests:
-- ELISA (Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) detects antibodies in
the serum of SARS patients reliably as of day 21 after the onset of
clinical symptoms and signs.
-- Immunofluorescence Assays detect antibodies in serum of SARS
patients after about day 10 of illness onset. This is a reliable test
requiring the use of fixed SARS-virus, an immunofluorescence
microscope, and an experienced microscopist. Positive antibody tests
indicate that the patient was infected with the SARS virus.
(2) Molecular tests (PCR):
Polymerase chain reaction( PCR) tests can detect genetic material of
the SARS-virus in various specimens (blood, stool, respiratory
secretions, or body tissue). [The sequences for oligonucleotide]
primers, which are the key components for a PCR test, have been made
publicly available by WHO network laboratories on the WHO web site.
The primers have since been used by numerous countries around the
world. A ready-to-use PCR test kit containing primers and positive
and negative control has been developed. Testing of the kit by
network members is expected to quickly yield the data needed to
assess the test's performance, in comparison with primers developed
by other WHO network laboratories. Existing PCR tests are very
specific but lack sensitivity. That means that negative tests cannot
rule out the presence of the SARS virus in patients. Various WHO
network laboratories are working on their PCR protocols and primers
to improve their reliability.
(3) Cell culture:
Virus in specimens (such as respiratory secretions, blood, or stool)
from SARS patients can also be detected by infecting cell cultures
and propagating the virus. Once isolated, the virus must be
identified as the SARS virus with further tests. Cell culture is a
very demanding test, but the only means to show the existence of a
live virus.

Testing for the SARS Virus: Hopes - and Realities
-------------------------------------------------
The SARS virus has struck Singapore and Asia with a vengeance. Since
it was first described in February 2003, more than 3200 individuals
worldwide have been afflicted with the severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS), and over 150 have [died]. The international medical
and research communities responded with unprecedented speed so that,
within 2 months, they unequivocally identified the causative agent as
a new coronavirus, now called the SARS virus, and confirmed its mode
of infection. Just this week, scientists from Canada, Hong Kong,
Singapore, and Atlanta in the United States each simultaneously
reported the entire sequence of the SARS virus genetic code. This
knowledge paves the way for the development of sensitive diagnostics
and even therapeutics.
It was no wonder then that when a DNA-based test to detect the SARS
virus was announced, hopes rose. Is there now a single test that can
definitively identify those infected with the virus before the
symptoms appear? The answer, however, is more complex than a simple
yes or no. Although we can now construct an extremely sensitive test,
factors beyond human control, such as the natural course of the
disease, the timing of viral shedding, and statistical realities,
will decide the ultimate usefulness of such a test. In truth, the
perfect diagnostic test -- which can tell with certainty, with just
one examination, whether someone has a disease or not -- simply does
not exist.
What makes a good diagnostic test? First, there is a need to [ensure]
biochemical specificity. This means that the chemicals used must
react only with the targets in the virus. In the case of the DNA
diagnostic test for the SARS viral genes, there is no doubt that
specificity is there. Second, there needs to be sensitivity. Again,
using current DNA diagnostic approaches (such as polymerase chain
reaction, or PCR) we can detect down to 500 to 1000 particles per
millilitre. Biochemical specificity and sensitivity are real and can
be provided now. The difficulty lies, however, in the behavior of the
virus. The amount of virus actually shed can vary 10 000-fold in any
one patient, and one million-fold between patients. When and where
the virus is shed is also unclear, but we know that there is only a
window of time that the virus can be detected from various body
fluids -- first in the sputum, then in the blood, and lastly in the
stool.
Unlike [influenza] virus, which has been studied for decades, SARS is
so new that little is known about its infectious course. So, as the
first SARS diagnostic tests are used, we will also be learning how to
use them wisely. For example, while a positive SARS-PCR result from
the sputum of a sick patient very likely means he has SARS, a
negative result may simply mean that we missed a window of viral
shedding. Therefore, a single negative test does not mean that the
person is disease-free. Does a positive test mean that someone is
infectious? We simply do not know. Our PCR tests detect viral nucleic
acids and cannot tell us whether the infectious particle is still
intact. So if a recovered SARS patient still excretes viral nucleic
acids in his stool, does this mean he is still infectious? And if so,
how infectious? We will need to continue the study of these
individuals as we treat them.
Do we stick with one test 'kit' or use others? As our understanding
of the SARS virus is still changing day by day, it would be a grave
error to believe in one test and not explore others. A simple reality
is that there are more than 29 000 [nucleotides] in the SARS virus
genome. Our current PCR diagnostics only test for 200 to 500 of these
[nucleotides]. It remains to be determined which genomic segment
[region; coronaviruses are not segmented genome viruses - Mod.CP]
would be the best target for the diagnostic reagent, so changes in
the diagnostic tests should be expected. The medical community must
develop a strategy that will quickly operationalise the best test at
any one time, and have systems to switch when a better one emerges.
Can we detect people who carry and excrete the virus but who have no
symptoms -- that is, asymptomatic carriers? Again, we do not know
right now, but we need to study this problem immediately. Here,
however, the use of a SARS-PCR test for asymptomatic carriers will be
different from its use on clinically active and sick patients. The
difference is due to statistical and technical realities.
Statistically, the less likely that the SARS virus is present in a
tested population (individuals without symptoms), the higher the
false positive rates (that is, the test results indicating that the
individual has SARS when he/she does not), lowering the usefulness of
the test.
Cost is also a consideration. Testing 100 patients hospitalised for
SARS symptoms at $200 a test (using a commercial diagnostic test) is
well within the means of the health-care system, even if multiple
tests need to be drawn. But the cost of following 1000 asymptomatic
individuals over a single quarantine duration, testing them every day
for 10 days, would be astronomical. The cost of the tests alone would
be $2 million, and this does not include funding for more laboratory
workers, space, and specialised equipment. Within the context of the
public health-care system, therefore, the use of commercial
diagnostic kits is not financially wise. For this reason, common
reagents dedicated for public health screening are often used instead
of commercial kits.
With recent diagnostics developments, we have much to hope for in the
battle against SARS. The key has been the identification of the virus
and the sequencing of its genome. These have enabled Singapore and
others to develop sensitive diagnostic tests. Who has the best test
now is irrelevant because, no matter what, the tests will improve
over time. Our challenge now is to use these tests to better
understand the course of SARS, and the nature of the infection. Here
is where the most important message must be taken to heart. We have a
good test, but we do not have a clinically 'hardened' test - that is,
a diagnostic that has been battle-tested for a long period of time.

[Some of these considerations in the application and interpretation
of SARS diagnostic tests were discussed in the preceding post (SARS -
worldwide (57): cases 20030418.0952) by moderator MPP in relation to
a SARS case reported from India with confirmation by PCR. The patient
was a New Zealander arriving from Bangkok, which to date has not been
reported as having areas of local transmission. The point was made
that a PCR test is capable of producing not only false negative
results (negative when there is a real infection), but also false
positives (positive when the individual is not infected with the
virus). Isolation of virus in cell culture remains the gold standard,
as it is the only test that indicates (albeit in retrospect) the
ability of an individual to transmit infection. - Mod.CP]
