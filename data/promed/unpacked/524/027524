A contagious disease is causing major concerns for horse owners in the Grand Valley [Colorado]. Owners are on high alert of a serious outbreak of what's called equine strangles disease.

It's one of the biggest outbreaks vets and owners have seen in a couple decades.

Vets said it's like the flu or strep throat for horses, and it spreads very quickly from horse to horse. People who care for animals can also spread the infection on their shoes and tools.

"Everyone is very concerned, about what's going on," said Shane Prentice [manager at Reimer's Rainbow Ranch]. "It has the potential to spread across the valley, if we aren't on top of it."

"This is by far the most I've ever seen in the valley... it's a significant number of cases, and it's something people should be aware of," said Dr Dominic Carrica, owner of Amigo Animal Clinic.

Once horses are diagnosed, they require mandatory quarantine, because it's such a contagious disease.

"Infected horses develop fevers, they stop eating, they may develop a cough, a snotty nose, and large abscess underneath the nose by the jaw, in the throat area," said Dr Carrica.

[Prentice] said they've had about a dozen cases and are taking proper precautions. "We started monitoring all the horses because of contagious manner [of the disease]. We take their temperatures' twice a day, on all horses. We take special care, to disinfect everything in this barn," he said.

Fearing the spread could go valley wide, horses at the ranch will not be allowed to do much until they are cleared with a vet.

"It could ruin our summer, for horse people anyway," said Prentice. "We are going to miss shows, but that is secondary to the health of the animal."

Vets recommend watching animals' behavior and if there is a noticeable changes to contact a vet right away to determine what are the best treatment options for the specific case.

Vets said even the general public can pick up a few tips to learn how to keep all pets healthy.

[While this article sounds quite serious, it does not tell us how many horses are affected. It grabs the attention with words like the 'largest ever', but it offers no supporting evidence for that. While the Grand Valley area of Colorado is nice horse country, and this disease is very contagious, there nevertheless remains little supporting evidence for the claims of the article. If this were a reportable disease in the state of Colorado, then the evidence may mount in a hurry. If it is not as large as this article purports, then we hope it does not spread. If it is in reality quite large, we hope it is rapidly contained.

_S. equi equi_ is highly contagious and produces high morbidity and low mortality in susceptible populations. Transmission occurs via fomites and direct contact with infectious exudates. Carrier animals are important for maintenance of the bacteria between epizootics and initiation of outbreaks on premises previously free of disease. Survival of the organism in the environment is dependent on temperature and humidity; it is susceptible to desiccation, extreme heat, and exposure to sunlight, and must be protected within mucoid secretions to survive. Under ideal environmental circumstances, the organism can survive 7-9 weeks outside the host. Paddocks and barn facilities used by infected horses should be regarded as contaminated for about 2 months after resolution of an outbreak.

The incubation period of strangles is 3-14 days and the 1st sign of infection is fever (103-106 deg F/39.4-41.1 deg C). Within 24-48 hours of the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs typical of strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal discharge, depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy.
