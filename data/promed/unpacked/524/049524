Rwanda: Sleeping sickness
--------------------------------------
A total of 25 people Bulongo and Butansi, Luuka county, Iganga
district, have been confirmed to be suffering from sleeping sickness,
reports Moses Nampala. A medical clinical officer, James Zironda, said
several cases handled by his unit had sleeping sickness, a disease
caused by the bite of a tsetse fly. "The biggest percentage of the
patients we are handling have fresh irritations that developed as a
result of recent bites from tsetse flies," Zironda said.
He attributed the re-emergence of sleeping sickness to the presence of
a vast thicket of Lantana Camara, a wild plant that harbours the
tsetse flies. Local Council officials in Rwanda village, Bulongo
county blamed the re-emergence of the disease to delays by vector
control authorities in administering preventive measures. "The last
time we had an aerial spray was 6 years ago," Ibrahim Kyoka, a
resident, said.
Residents said tsetse fly traps provided 6 years ago needed to be
replaced. Zironda regretted that some sleeping sickness victims
avoided medical treatment and sought help from native herbalists,
mistaking the disease for lunacy. As a result, some patients
reportedly died.

[With the emergence of sleeping sickness in the neighbouring countries
Tanzania, Uganda and the Democratic Republic Congo, it is not
surprising that sleeping sickness is also being experienced in Rwanda.
As pointed out in the message, rigorous vector control is as important
as ever. - Mod.EP
