Six people who recently traveled to the United States after fleeing the Taliban in Afghanistan have been diagnosed with measles, officials said Tuesday [14 Sep 2021]. The cases in Virginia and Wisconsin are being reported 4 days after the US halted inbound flights of Afghan evacuees following the discovery of a few cases of measles among new arrivals.

One case was confirmed [5 Sep 2021] at Fort McCoy, an army base in western Wisconsin that is temporarily housing 8000 people as they prepare to settle throughout the country.

Cheryl Phillips, a spokeswoman for a task force overseeing the refugees at Fort McCoy, said one person showed symptoms [4 Sep 2021] after arriving at the base earlier that day. The person was placed in isolation and others who were potentially exposed were quarantined and given measles vaccinations, Phillips said.

The Virginia Department of Health initially said Friday [10 Sep 2021] that 3 people who arrived from Afghanistan had been diagnosed with measles in northern Virginia. The agency said it was informing people who risked possible exposure at places that included Dulles International Airport and 2 local hospitals.

The agency updated its count of measles cases to 5 in a news release Tuesday [14 Sep 2021]. Health officials said they were working to notify people potentially exposed at an unidentified Richmond hospital as well as Fort Pickett, an Army National Guard base southwest of Richmond that is providing temporary housing to recently arrived evacuees.

Measles is a highly contagious disease that can be spread through coughing, sneezing, and contact with droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat. Most Americans are vaccinated against it as children.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday [10 Sep 2021] that all arriving Afghans are required to be vaccinated for measles as a condition of entry into the US. She said immunizations are being administered at military bases in the US, while officials are also exploring measures to vaccinate people while they're still overseas.

The measles cases in Virginia and Wisconsin have been reported in the wake of the US government halting US-bound flights of Afghan evacuees Friday [10 Sep 2021]. The decision was made by US Customs and Border Protection on the recommendation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Psaki said Friday [10 Sep 2021] that the halt stemmed from the discovery of measles among 4 Afghans who had arrived in the United States. The development had American officials overseas Friday removing from planes Afghan families who already had struggled through a grueling, dangerous escape to safety after Kabul fell to the Taliban on [15 Aug 2021]. Afghans faced Taliban checkpoints and crushing crowds to enter the Kabul airport. A suicide attack at an airport gate killed 169 Afghans and 13 US military members.

A government document viewed by The Associated Press said the halt would "severely impact" operations at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, one of the biggest transit sites. It also said US-bound flights would stop from the US al-Udeid base in Qatar.

Many thousands of Afghan evacuees airlifted out of Kabul are still en route to new homes in the United States. Some face relocation for further screening in Kosovo.

[A paper that informs on the infectious diseases endemic to Afghanistan not generally found in the West is recommended reading. Doctors in countries and U.S. states where the refugees have relocated should be made aware of these diseases. An excerpt from Wallace MR, Hale BR, Utz GC, et al. Endemic infectious diseases of Afghanistan. Clin Infect Dis. 2002; 34(Suppl 5): S171-207; https://doi.org/10.1086/340704 follows:

"This review surveys the literature concerning the infectious diseases of Afghanistan and south-central Asia, with particular emphasis on diseases not typically seen in the Western world....[While the political situation has changed in Afghanistan, the diseases remain the same.]

"Available data suggest that the Afghan population is greatly affected by infectious diseases, with reports of excess mortality from diarrheal disease (including cholera), respiratory tract infections, and measles.

Measles
-------
"Measles is one of the most serious disease threats to the local population of Afghanistan. This disease has the capacity, in the setting of overcrowding and malnutrition, to cause epidemics resulting in massive morbidity and mortality. A measles epidemic was most recently reported in April 2000, with at least 1200 fatalities and a case fatality rate of 8%-13% (324). Most of the deaths were reported from Badakhshan, bordering Tajikistan.

Epidemiology. Humans are the only species infected by this virus, which causes one of the most communicable diseases known. Natural transmission has been interrupted in the United States and is uncommon in other industrialized countries. The illness is still common in the developing world, where it is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality. In a recent household survey in the Kohistan district of Afghanistan, measles was 1 of the top 2 causes of death in children <10 years (2). Measles is also a leading cause of blindness among children. The number of cases peaks in the winter and early spring.

Clinical findings. Measles in the developing countries is much more severe than most Western physicians would recognize. Among refugees and those compromised by inadequate nutrition, the case fatality rate can exceed 20%. The illness should be easily diagnosed from the constellation of signs, including the maculopapular rash, starting on the face and proceeding inferiorly and to the extremities. The rash can become petechial or even purpuric in the compromised host. Coryza and conjunctivitis are prominent, and patients may experience significant diarrhea or respiratory complaints. Pneumonia is the most common severe complication, either primary measles pneumonia or superinfecting bacterial pneumonia with streptococci, staphylococci, or Haemophilus influenzae. Bacterial lymphadenitis is also a possible complication, as well as croup and otitis media (322). The neurological sequelae may include encephalitis. Measles can become hemorrhagic in the compromised host and may resemble a hemorrhagic fever. Koplik's spots should be sought for diagnostic purposes, because they are essentially pathognomonic if found.

Diagnosis. The most common means of diagnosis is serology. Detection of IgM antibody by ELISA is the preferred method and is diagnostic of acute measles in a person who has not recently received live attenuated measles vaccine. False-negative testing can occur, particularly if the sample is taken in the first 72 h after rash onset (325); acute and convalescent IgG can also be diagnostic if a 4-fold increase in titer occurs. Histological demonstration of multinucleated giant cells in sputum or mucosal swab specimens can be a practical means of making the diagnosis in the field.

Treatment. There is no specific treatment of measles, but many complications of measles in the malnourished child can be ameliorated by the administration of vitamin A. 2 consecutive doses of 200 000 IU orally (100 000 IU in those <1 year) should be given to those with severe symptoms (322). In the refugee setting, it is prudent to give vitamin A to all with measles.

Prevention. The current measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is safe and effective. If given within 72 h of exposure, it can also prevent disease. Immunoglobulin, which is usually given as immune serum globulin, can modify or prevent disease when administered within 6 days of exposure, at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg (immunocompromised, 0.5 mg/kg) up to a maximum dose of 15 mg (322). It should be noted that immunoglobulin will interfere with the immune response to the measles vaccine, so administration of the vaccine should be delayed if immunoglobulin has been given. Vaccination of populations at risk before outbreaks of disease is much preferred."
