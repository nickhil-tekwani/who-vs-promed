Cross-reactivity of antibodies to viruses belonging to the Semliki
Forest serocomplex.

We read with interest the paper by Receveur et al. describing an
infection with Mayaro virus in a French traveller returning from the
Amazon region [1] [See ProMED-mail archived 20100507.1481]. We agree
that this communication is of clinical relevance because Mayaro virus
infections are relatively unknown and easily misdiagnosed on clinical
grounds as dengue fever.

Although Mayaro virus has been reported to be a member of the Semliki
forest serocomplex [2] -- clustering with old world alphaviruses such
as chikungunya virus, with their clinical manifestations of fever and
arthralgias -- Mayaro virus infections are as yet confined to South
America. The other alphaviruses that occur in South America belong to
the so-called New World alphaviruses such as Eastern equine
encephalitis virus, Western equine encephalitis virus and Venezuelan
equine encephalitis virus. The clinical manifestations are
characterised by central nervous system symptoms but not by arthralgias.

Small outbreaks of Mayaro virus infection have been registered in
areas near tropical rain forests in various South American countries
including Brazil, Suriname [3] and Venezuela (see ProMED archive
20100606.1889), but infections outside these endemic foci are rare,
particularly in travellers. In 1966, Metselaar described a Mayaro
virus infection in a son of a Dutch military man, living in the
Coronie District in Suriname [4]. In January 2008, we diagnosed Mayaro
virus infection in a Dutch couple who presented with intractable
arthralgias after visiting the interior of Suriname (manuscript
submitted). In serological tests using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA), we detected cross-reactivity of antibodies for
chikungunya virus and Mayaro virus. As mentioned earlier, both these
alphaviruses belong to the same antigenic complex, the Semliki forest
serocomplex. Seroneutralization tests were therefore necessary to
demonstrate the specificity of the antibody for Mayaro
virus.

Receveur et al. seem not to have used these seroneutralization tests.
Currently, cross-reactivity in serological tests does not seem to be
of major importance for diagnosis, since chikungunya viral infections
do not occur in South America. However, with the increase of
international travel and the spread of potential vectors as a
consequence of global warming and intensification of trade, infections
caused by arthropod-borne viruses are likely to expand on a global
scale and may result in overlapping regions of endemicity. This
cross-reactivity between alphaviruses should be borne in mind, in
particular when ELISA is used for serological diagnosis of the
causative virus. Additional seroneutralisation tests should be carried
out to establish the virus specificity of the antibody.

[As a consequence of increasing international travel and the spread of
potential vectors by climate change, more refined diagnostic methods
may become necessary to distinguish viruses of the Semliki forest
serocomplex. In particular, it may be epidemiologically relevant to
distinguish Mayaro virus infections from other epidemiologically
unrelated arthralgia-associated alphavirus infections (e.g.
chikungunya virus infections). - Mod.CP]

[Since there was no evidence of virus by isolation or PCR, no IgG at
all, even more than 3 months after onset and the IgM antibody was
apparently of very low titer at both 2 months (O.D. 0.34) and more
than 3 months (O.D. 0.49) -- by 2 months the O.D. should be way up,
maybe more than 4.0 -- this sounds more like a heterologous reaction,
not antibody to whatever agent it might have been. However, if the
IgM is persisting after 3 months and there is still no detectable IgG
antibody, either this is a unique case or the IgM assay is not
specific, at least in this instance. The patient might actually have
had a Mayaro virus infection but they have not proven that beyond
"probable", not "confirmed".

In the light of the recent spread of chikungunya virus to the Indian
Ocean islands and of the spread of other arboviruses from the Old
World to the New (e.g. West Nile virus), it seems important, as the
writer of the article suggests, to verify that the infection reported
was really due to Mayaro virus. Alternatively, this may be the first
indication that CHIK virus has spread to the Americas. - Mod.JW]
