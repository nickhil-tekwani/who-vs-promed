[Note: the official name of the disease is "Venezuelan equine
encephalo-myelitis", but it has always been abbreviated to
"encephalitis" in ProMED archives. - ProMED]

[The location of the outbreak is just on the northern edge of the
Darien Gap, the often referred to as the animal buffer zone for
foot-and-mouth Disease between Central America and South America. The
epidemiologic pattern in the region is interesting according to data
provided by OIE WAHID. However, never recently has this disease
approached the historic and massive dimensions of the 1969-1971
pandemic.

Some countries such as Belize and Colombia report regularly. Belize,
for example, has reported VEE every year since 2005, except 2006, with
the maximum number of cases being 8 in 2009. Guatemala and Colombia
have reported every year prior to this year since 2005. On the other
hand, some countries will only report an occasional outbreak. Costa
Rica only reported in 2009 with 3 outbreaks, a singule report from
Honduras indicated 8 outbreaks in 2007. Venezuela reported an outbreak
in 2005 but not since then. El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Mexico have
not reported outbreaks during this period. Panama only previously
reported in 2005 but lacked quantitative data on the outbreak.

For an excellent summary of control and surveillance issues in horses
in the region, ProMED-mail previously referred to a summary by Dr
Belloto at the Veterinary Public Health Program, PAHO. Interested
readers can see the material copied below or see
<http://www.paho.org/english/dd/PED/te_equi.htm>.

"Equine encephalitides are viral zoonoses that occur episodically and
cause outbreaks in equines and, less frequently, in humans. The
etiological agents are viruses belonging to the genus _Alphavirus_ in
the _Togaviridae_ family. Infection is maintained in natural foci
between wild reservoirs and mosquitoes. Three viruses are important:
Western equine (WEE), eastern equine (EEE) and Venezuelan equine
encephalomyelitis (VEE). A 4th member, Highlands J virus, occurs in
the eastern United States, primarily in Florida.

"In Central America, a growing activity of syndromes compatible with
equine encephalitis has been observed in horses during the last 3
years, particularly in Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama.
Laboratory isolations of the virus and/or serological typing have
shown EEE and VEE viral infection. These 2 agents are known to cause
high morbidity and mortality among horses, donkeys and mules that, in
turn, become amplifiers of the infection that eventually spreads to
humans by mosquito bites.

"The VEE virus has caused major epidemics in the Americas. In 1969, an
outbreak started in Ecuador and spread through Peru, Colombia,
Venezuela, Central America, and Mexico reaching finally Texas in 1971.
Close to 50 000 equines died. In Ecuador alone, 31 000 human cases
were reported and 310 deaths.

"In 1995, an outbreak occurred in Venezuela and Colombia that affected
7 states in Venezuela and the department of La Guajira in Colombia.
This outbreak registered more than 40 000 human cases and 46 deaths.
The outbreak was associated with a period of unusually intense rain
with a subsequent increase of mosquito vectors of VEE virus and the
lack of vaccination among the equine population.

"The current situation in Central America is similar:

- The existence of natural foci where viral infection persists in wild
reservoirs, which include rodents, wild birds and bats.
- An increase in the population of mosquito vectors. Stagnant waters
in flooded lands favor an increase in mosquito breeding sites and
consequently, the growth of their population and a greater exposure of
the domestic animals and humans to mosquito bites and infections
carried by them.
- A susceptible equine population. With the exception of a few areas
in Guatemala and Belize, registries of horse vaccinations against VEE
and/or EEE in the last 4 years are non-existent in the countries
affected by Hurricane Mitch. A population that is entirely
susceptible to the infection can be implied. The displacement of
humans and their congregation in vulnerable areas, such as overcrowded
refugee camps, surrounded by infected domestic animals, stagnant
waters, and poor hygienic conditions, will be part of the scenario of
a possible epidemic.

"We [PAHO] are alerting the health authorities in these areas to
improve surveillance of neurological syndromes compatible with equine
encephalomyelitis in equines and to strengthen coordination among
sectors for this purpose. Special consideration should be given to
high-risk areas where there are larger numbers of horses, mules and
donkeys (late predictors of equine encephalitides epidemics) and no
history of vaccination against EEE and/or VEE exists, in order to take
timely and adequate preventive and control measures such as:

1. Immediate vaccination of horses mules, and donkeys.
2. Detection and treatment of mosquito breeding sites, especially
those close to permanent and temporary human settlements (refugees).
3. Equine case monitoring and reporting, characterized by:
- Fever, anorexia and depression accompanied by nervous signs such as:
deep depression, difficulties with equilibrium, resting the head on
objects, insomnia. Some animals might show hypersensitivity to touch
and sound, excitation, walk in circles, blindness, and bumping into
obstacles. They often fall and are unable to get up.
4. Monitoring of probable human cases, characterized by:
- Fever headache, nausea, vomiting, pains in the muscles and joints,
chills, photophobia and prostration, convulsions or alteration of the
state of consciousness, somnolence, hyperacusia [abnormal acuteness of
hearing] and coma.
- In people under 3 years of age: fever, alterations of the state of
consciousness or convulsions."
