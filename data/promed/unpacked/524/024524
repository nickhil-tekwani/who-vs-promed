ENTEROVIRUS OUTBREAK - BELARUS: REQUEST FOR REAGENTS
****************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

We are engaged in investigations of viral water contamination. Nowadays, we
have some difficulties with enterovirus detection because of great outbreak
of serous [sic] meningitis in Gomel (the city is situated within the
Chernobyl area). We suppose that the source of this outbreak is contaminated
drinking water. Up to now there are 205 patients (children and adults) in
Gomel.

We would be very thankful if anyone finds it possible to send us the primers
for enteroviruses and some other reagents to identify the outbreak agent(s).

attachment by which this request was sent; on 3 separate occasions on 2
different computers, once editing was complete and we tried to post it, the
system froze. A computer enterovirus? - Mod.JW]
