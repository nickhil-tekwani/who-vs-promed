Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have
released genetic blueprints for over 650 genes of influenza viruses into a
database accessible to researchers worldwide. The action marks the
beginning of a collaboration between the CDC and the Association of Public
Health Laboratories (APHL) that will allow for greater access to data on a
variety of influenza virus samples obtained from patients in the United
States, including avian influenza H5N1 if it should arrive here.
Through the new collaboration, CDC expects to provide genetic information
for several hundred influenza viruses per year as a way to encourage more
research on influenza. The sequence data will be available in nearly real
time through GenBank, the public-access library for virus sequences managed
by the National Institutes of Health, and through an influenza database
housed at Los Alamos National Laboratories (LANL). The information added
will include viruses from the annual flu season in the United States, any
animal influenza viruses that infect humans and any novel strains that may
emerge such as avian influenza H5N1. The new agreement will only apply to
viruses isolated in the United States.
"CDC has long supported the timely and open sharing of influenza virus
information to foster new research on influenza. We're excited that this
historic collaboration with APHL provides a way to make international
exchange of this information possible," said Dr. Nancy Cox, Director of the
CDC's Influenza Division. "With more information, the world's influenza
experts can advance our understanding of the viruses circulating,
potentially create new prevention strategies and treatments, and ultimately
help us better protect the health of people around the world."
The sequence information, which is like a DNA fingerprint of each virus,
allows researchers to determine more about a virus's origin and to compare
it to other influenza viruses. This will help scientists determine whether
the virus is susceptible to antiviral drugs and, in the case of avian
influenza currently circulating in much of the world, to assess whether
it's changing in a way that might make the virus more easily transmissible
among people -- a key property the virus would need to acquire to spark a
pandemic. In addition, the sequences can be used to better identify the
strains that should be included in the yearly flu vaccine.
Previously, the influenza sequences were available to a small number of
influenza researchers who work together with WHO to recommend which
influenza viruses should be included in influenza vaccines around the
world. The sequence data will now be available through GenBank to anyone
with Internet access.
APHL, the national association representing public health laboratories,
collaborated with its members to gain approval from all 50 state
laboratories to make sequence data from influenza viruses tested in these
labs publicly available. APHL promotes effective programs and public policy
to strengthen laboratory capacity to protect the health of U.S. residents
and to prevent and control disease globally.
"State health department laboratories analyze and subtype thousands of
influenza viruses each year. If a novel virus is out there, we will likely
be the first to detect it. This is why public health labs are a critical
part of our country's early warning system for pandemic influenza, and why
this collaboration with CDC is so important," said APHL President Dr. Jane
Getchell.
State public health laboratories participate in national influenza
surveillance efforts by subtyping viruses and routinely submitting some
influenza viruses to CDC for more in-depth characterization. CDC asks
public health labs to submit samples of influenza viruses from the
beginning, peak, and end of each flu season, as well as any samples that
are unusual. Under the new agreement, if a novel strain is identified at
CDC, the state laboratory which submitted it would be notified prior to the
posting in Genbank or LANL databases.
CDC has been actively working with the World Health Organization to
encourage sharing of viruses from countries with avian flu activity. After
the Indonesian government recently agreed to make available the sequences
for viruses from Indonesian bird flu patients, CDC placed total genome
sequences for over 40 H5N1 viruses into a public-access database.
"We hope these initiatives will set the stage for other countries to adopt
similar approaches to the release of Influenza virus sequence data that
they manage" Cox said.

devalued by its restriction to viruses isolated in the United States. - Mod.CP]
