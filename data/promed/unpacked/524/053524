A domesticated cat that bit a woman in the Dawnville area Tuesday night [28 Feb 2017] has testified positive for rabies, the Whitfield County [Georgia] rabies control officer said [Fri 3 Mar 2017].

David Hedden said the incident happened on Mark Brown Road off of Mitchell Bridge Road. The woman is having to take rabies shots, he said. [This is the post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) series to prevent the rabies virus from killing her. - Mod.TG]

Hedden said officials are encouraging everyone to make sure their pets are vaccinated against rabies, which is required under state law.

He said it is important that people do not approach any animal that is acting in a strange manner. If you see such an animal, call 911, he said.

The North Georgia Health District said on 24 Feb 2017 a Whitfield County dog was recently bitten by a raccoon that had since tested positive for rabies. The dog was unvaccinated and is undergoing a 6-month quarantine. That incident happened at a residence on Dogwood Drive off Pine Hill Road and East Morris Street in Dalton. The dog fought back and killed the raccoon.

Hedden said this is the 5th case of rabies detected in the county in the last 8 or 9 months.

Hedden and officials with Whitfield County Environmental Health and Whitfield County Animal Control have been passing out fliers in these areas to warn residents of the presence of rabies.

The North Georgia Health District said in the press release on 24 Feb 2017, "Residents should be wary of unfamiliar animals, and parents should take special care to inform their children about rabies, telling children to avoid stray dogs and cats, as well as wild animals, and to report any such contacts or bites at once."

Ray King, director of Environmental Health for the North Georgia Health District, said, "The chance of dying from rabies is almost 100 percent if the exposed person is not given preventive treatments soon after exposure. Rabies is a horrible way to die."

Raccoons are the most common animal found with rabies in Georgia, the health district said, but many other species can contract rabies such as skunks, foxes, bobcats, coyotes, and bats. Livestock can also contract rabies from wild animals and it is "strongly recommended" that livestock that have regular contact with humans be vaccinated.

Suspicious animals that appear aggressive or sick can also be reported to Whitfield County Animal Control.

http://rare.us/rare-animals/man-out-for-a-morning-jog-attacked-by-rabid-coyote/


A man is recovering after being attacked by a coyote Monday morning [27 Feb 2017] in Roswell [Fulton County], Georgia.

[A man] said he was out for a run when the animal attacked. "I looked down and grabbed him by the neck and pushed down trying to get him off the leg. And then when I got him pinned down I realized it wasn't a dog. It was a coyote," he said.

"I've been jogging for 5 years, never imagined that I would be taken down by an animal, least of all a coyote," the victim said. "He was growling when he was biting on my leg." A bandage remains on the victim's leg where the coyote bit him.

While a neighbor called 911, the victim pinned the animal to the ground for 20 minutes until help arrived. "I had him pretty well dazed. I was choking him pretty tightly. I didn't want to let go and have him bite me again," the victim said.

Darryl Carver with the Fulton County Department of External Affairs said in an emailed statement that police "responded, fatally wounding the animal and calling Fulton County Animal Control officers to the scene to remove it."

Carver said the coyote "was sent to a lab for testing where it was determined that it tested positive for rabies. The victim is currently receiving treatment for exposure to rabies as a result."

[The jogger] said Roswell police and animal control both told him that coyote attacks are extremely rare in the area.

Fulton County Animal Control will be distributing flyers in the area to alert residents and provide information on rabies and how to respond to any animals with the disease.

[3] Florida: raccoon, human exposure

http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article136385048.html


A local veterinarian attacked by a rabid raccoon in Kendall says Miami-Dade County may have botched the 1st alert in 16 years.

The veterinarian believes Miami Dade College students and teachers are at risk and should be notified after a rabid raccoon was discovered nearby. Yet the college and surrounding homes and businesses are being excluded from a public health alert.

CBS4 met the veterinarian in his driveway [Fri 3 Mar 2017] where he had caught another raccoon.

"In the last 15 minutes I caught one outside," he said. Cute? Absolutely. But the veterinarian warns to not be fooled. It could have rabies just like the one that woke him up a week ago at 4:30 a.m.

"I hear a scream. A rabid scream," he explained. He walked outside to find "a raccoon chewing, literally trying to eat my cat."

"So I walk over and the raccoon jumps in the pool and starts swimming like a snake in the water," he explained. "I'm standing there and it comes out and attacks me. Physically attacks. Saliva everywhere. Broken teeth. Spit out a plant."

The veterinarian said he kicked it and it attacked him 3 times before it died. He alerted animal control, who after testing confirmed it was indeed rabid.

The Miami-Dade Health Department issued a rare 60-day rabies public health alert for homeowners in the area. But oddly enough, they choose to include only the homes north of [the veterinarian's] house.

"Raccoons only walk north? They don't go south at all? There has to be a reason it stops here," he said.

To the south are homes and Miami Dade College. "Miami Dade is right over there. Thousands of students," the veterinarian said.

"That's what I'm worried about. I'll be OK. I'm concerned that the boundary is right here. Yet over there, where the raccoons are breeding, people are exposed," he said. "And raccoons don't just stay in the 500-foot [150 m] area, 1000-foot [300 m] area. 75 acres [30 ha] wide is where they travel, 5 miles 8 km] in any direction."

It turns out the Health Department did alert Miami Dade College. A statement from the college said:
"We were notified by the Health Department immediately. The Kendall Campus facilities team is aware. Independent of this incident, the campus, because of its location near natural areas, we always takes precautions with regard to the proper containment of trash and food waste. We don't have any reports raccoon sightings on the actual campus but have pledged to report any if seen." [But the campus statement does not say they notified the students. This could be an oversight on the part of the college - Mod.TG]

Animal control is now calling and handing out these flyers to the homeowners in the public health alert zone. [Why are they not including the campus and surrounding campus areas? Do they think students don't have pets? - Mod.TG]

The veterinarian says it's not enough. He wants the alert area widened to include the college and wants someone to start trapping animals. [If the area has as many raccoons as many urban/suburban areas, the veterinarian is likely right. - Mod.TG]

Animal service told CBS4 they do not have plans to trap.

With regard to the boundaries of the alert, the Health Department said the current perimeter was based on the advice of staff epidemiologist. They did not elaborate.

[This article does not tell us the veterinarian had a high titer to rabies, as many veterinarians are vaccinated against rabies. It also does not tell us if he required PEP (post exposure prophylaxis).

However, with rabies in the area it is better to cast a wide net, erring on the side of caution, than to be to lax and have someone else bit. The campus did not indicate it notified the students and this could be problematic.

One has to wonder why the epidemiologist did not include the campus in the alert? - Mod.TG

A fox that repeatedly bit a 71-year-old woman before trying to attack a couple and their cat tested positive for rabies and has been euthanized.

The 1st attack occurred [Mon 6 Mar 2017] in Fairfax County, when the fox bit the elderly woman on the arms, legs, and hands. The woman was badly injured but is expected to survive. The fox then traveled about a mile away and attacked a cat, whose owner was able to knock the fox out and put it into a cage.

[5] South Carolina: feline, possible human exposure

http://wbtw.com/2017/03/14/stray-cat-tests-positive-for-rabies-after-biting-florence-county-resident/


A Florence County resident may have been exposed to rabies after being bitten by a stray cat.

The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DEHC) says the person was bitten by the cat on their property on 7 Mar 2017. The incident happened at a home just north of the Florence Regional Airport.

The cat was placed under quarantine and died 9 March 2017, according to DHEC. Lab results released 10 Mar 2017 confirmed the cat had rabies. The victim was referred to their personal doctor by DHEC to be tested for the disease and treated as needed. [Hopefully they fully assessed this person and determined if PEP was needed. - Mod.TG]

"Rabies is transmitted when saliva or neural tissue of an infected animal is introduced into the body of a healthy person or animal. This usually occurs through a bite, however, saliva contact with open wounds or areas such as the eyes, nose or mouth, could also potentially transmit rabies," said Craig.

DHEC also recommends keeping your pets up-to-date on their rabies vaccination.

The stray cat is the 1st animal in Florence County to test positive for rabies in 2017. There have been 7 confirmed cases of animal rabies statewide this year. In 2016, one of the 94 rabies cases in South Carolina was in Florence County.

One person has been referred to receive medical attention after potentially being exposed to rabies.

According to the Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC), a raccoon was found injured near Mt Hermon Lutheran Church in West Columbia on 10 Mar 2017. Officials said the potentially infected raccoon was taken to a wildlife rehabilitation facility, where the raccoon bit the victim while the animal was being evaluated.

The raccoon was taken to a DHEC lab and later confirmed to have rabies.

"Rabies is transmitted when saliva or neural tissue of an infected animal is introduced into the body of a healthy person or animal. This usually occurs through a bite; however, saliva contact with open wounds or areas such as the eyes, nose or mouth could also potentially transmit rabies," said Sandra Craig of DHEC's Bureau of Environmental Health Services.

Officials said the raccoon is the 2nd animal in Lexington County to test positive for rabies in 2017. South Carolina has had 10 confirmed cases of animal rabies this year [2017].

Last year [2016], 5 of 94 statewide rabies cases were in Lexington County.

[7] New York: raccoon, domestic animals, human exposure

https://www.tapinto.net/towns/greater-olean/articles/portville-incident-is-eighth-confirmed-case-of-ra


A rabid raccoon attacked a person and several domestic animals at a private residence on Whitehouse Road [Portville, Cattaraugus County] on [6 Mar 2017] before it was captured.

Laboratory testing by the New York State Department of Health confirmed that the animal was infected with the rabies virus. The incident is the 8th laboratory-confirmed case of rabies exposure in Cattaraugus County in the past 12 months.

Rabies is common in the wild and is found throughout the county, and the Health Department asks all residents to be aware of any unusual behavior in animals, both domestic and wild.

Signs of rabies in animals include unusual behavior (passive or aggressive), staggering, convulsions, and neurological symptoms such as partial paralysis or seizures. The rabies virus is transmitted via the saliva of a rabid animal, primarily through a bite or scratch. Immediate medical treatment is required.

Infection by the rabies virus can be fatal for mammals, including cats, dogs, and humans, [and any other mammal. - Mod.TG]. Any resident believing themselves or their pets may have been in contact with a rabid animal should contact the Cattaraugus County Health Department immediately.

The Health Department would like to remind all cat and dog owners to ensure that their pets are current on their rabies vaccinations. New York State requires rabies vaccinations for all cats, dogs and domestic ferrets over 4 months of age, including indoor animals.

Authorities say that a bat that bit an 11-year-old girl in Arkansas has tested positive for rabies.

A news release from the city of Hot Springs [Garland County] says the city's animal services department has been notified by state health officials that the bat is rabid.

The release says the girl and her mother were visiting a dam in the area when the girl found the bat lying on a rock. The girl picked up the bat and threw it into the water, but not before it bit her.

The bat swam back to shore and was collected by the mother, who took it to animal services for testing.

The names of the girl and her mother and their hometown were not released.

[9] Ontario): bovine, possible human exposure

http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/another-cow-tests-positive-for-rabies-in-perth-county-1.4035999


Another cow has tested positive for the Arctic fox strain of rabies in Perth County, bringing the total number of rabies cases in the region to 6 since 2015.

The young heifer was located on a farm in Elma Ward near Listowel where another cow contracted the disease in November 2016.

Elma Ward is a rural farming community including Atwood, Britton, Donegal, Gotham, Newry, and Trowbridge in the municipality of North Perth.

"This positive result continues to remind us that rabies is still present in Perth County," Dale Lyttle, senior public health inspector, said in a press release.

The infected calf most likely contracted rabies by coming into contact with a rabid wild animal, such as a skunk or fox.

The local health unit is currently working with the farm to determine potential human exposure.

The Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs has placed the remaining farm animals under a 40 day period of confinement, until it is determined that no other cattle have contracted the disease.

So far, the following animals have tested positive for rabies in Perth County:
- the 1st animal, a calf, tests positive in December 2015;
- a skunk located in Ellice Ward tests positive in April 2016;
- a cow from a dairy farm in Elma Ward tests positive in November 2016;
- a calf from a beef farm in Wallace Ward tests positive in January 2017;
- a 2nd calf from the same beef farm in Wallace Ward tests positive in January 2017;
- a young heifer from a dairy farm in Elma Ward tests positive in March 2017.

Some of these articles were great at mentioning pets need to have up-to-date rabies vaccinations. This is critical for your pet, and for your protection as well.

Large animals, such as cattle, horses, and others need rabies prevention vaccination as well. Many handle their animals on a regular basis, such as dairy animals, show animals, FFA (Future Farmers of America), 4-H, other school project animals, horses for riding or showing, all represent a means of joy, but also a means of exposure for humans. It is cheap insurance to vaccinate your animals, save their lives, and potentially yours.

Rabid animals are unpredictable as many of these articles show. Even if you are in an urban/suburban/city area, your pet still needs a rabies prevention vaccine.

Most all mammals are susceptible to the rabies virus. Build a wall between the virus and yourself by vaccinating your pets, regardless of their size or use. - Mod.TG]
