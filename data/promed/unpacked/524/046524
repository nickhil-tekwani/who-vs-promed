State health officials have issued a warning to consumers about beef
linked to several _E. coli_ cases in Washington and Oregon.
The Washington State Department of Health says the illnesses were
reported in late July & the 1st week of August 2007. A child and 5
adults were sickened in King, Island and Clallam counties; 2 people
were hospitalized but have since recovered, the department said.
The beef was sold in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Alaska. In
Washington, distributed to QFC, Safeway and Fred Meyer stores.
Officials said the potentially contaminated beef is no longer on
store shelves, but they urged consumers to check their freezers.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection
Service (FSIS) is issuing a public health alert for approximately 41
305 pounds of ground beef products that may be contaminated with _E.
coli_ O157:H7 that were produced at Interstate Meat Dist. Inc., a
Clackamas, Oregon establishment.
Each package also bears the establishment number "Est. 965" inside
the USDA mark of inspection as well as a sell-by date between
"08/01/07" and "08/11/07."
The ground beef products were produced on various dates between 19
and 30 Jul 2007 and were distributed to retail establishments in
Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
Based on product shelf life, these products would no longer have been
sold in grocery stores after 5 Aug 2007. However, these products
could be in consumers' freezers, and it is important that consumers
look for and return these products if they find them.

[Recalls are difficult to perform effectively since in many
situations, the end stage of distribution (the consumer) never hears
about them. The recent canned food botulism recall illustrated the
problems even related to small retail establishments.
Fortunately, with contaminated ground beef, appropriate cooking and
good kitchen hygiene to prevent cross contamination can prevent this
potentially lethal illness. - Mod.LL]
