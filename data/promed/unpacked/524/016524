Stingrays in central Queensland could be showing signs of the same
illness that is killing fish in the Gladstone Harbour.

The government banned fishing in the harbour [since week of 19 Sep
2011] after sick fish with cloudy eyes and sores were found.
Biosecurity Queensland say initial tests found red-spot disease
[epizootic ulcerative syndrome] and a parasite were the cause.

Capricorn Conservation Council coordinator Michael McCabe says 2
stingrays have been found about 90 kilometres [56 mi] north of
Gladstone Harbour at Emu Park and Yeppoon with similar red spots.
"There is a lot of anxiety in the community about what is causing
this," Mr McCabe told AAP [Australian Associated Press]. "We've got
photos of a dead stingray with a red rash. Our concerns are it could
be linked to what's happening to the fish at Gladstone."

Fisheries Queensland says it has not received samples of any stingrays
with lesions and cannot confirm whether they are also diseased.

A spokeswoman said red spot disease had been found in a range of
native fish species in Queensland, including mullet, bream, whiting,
pikey bream, eels, and catfish, but not stingrays. "There is no
evidence that red spot disease occurs in sharks and stingrays," she
said.

The Gladstone Ports Corporation has said there is no link between
massive dredging work being undertaken in the harbour and the diseased
fish.

Mr McCabe is urging the community to take photos of any sick marine
life and send it to authorities. He said his attempts to obtain
monitoring information on marine life from port authorities and
industry groups to understand the bigger picture have been
unsuccessful.

[Red spot disease (epizootic ulcerative syndrome) is quite a serious
ulcerative disease of many (more than 100) species of freshwater and
estuarine fish. The causative agent of red spot disease is a fungus,
_Aphanomyces invadans_. The infection has not been documented in
cartilaginous fish (sharks, rays).

Red spot disease outbreaks are associated with stress. This episode is
associated with environmental disruption (dredging work) and die-off
of other unrelated species, that is, dugongs (mammals) and turtles
(reptilians). The whole ecosystem health appears to be compromised.
Another example where the "One health" concept becomes highly
relevant. Human health hazards from red spot disease outbreaks are
related to secondary bacterial infections. - Mod.PMB]
