A Moore baby is hospitalized after contracting _E. coli_. The State Health Department confirms they are investigating several cases in children in the Moore area. The department says this is not related to the nationwide romaine lettuce _E. coli_ outbreak but instead, the bacterium can be traced back to a Moore day care.

Earlier in April 2018, it was obvious that something was very wrong with a young child. "She wouldn't even lift up her head, she was not eating anything. She wouldn't play with her toys. She just wanted to be held," said the grandmother and guardian.

The day before, Neveah came home sick from day care. "She had some diarrhea that was pretty violent and had blood," said the grandmother. The child was admitted to the hospital and doctors eventually confirmed she had _E. coli_.

The State Health Department says they have identified 5 cases of _E. coli_ that can be traced back to a Moore day care. But say that's not all that unusual. "Clusters of cases happen in group settings, especially in child care facilities that are interacting on a daily basis," explained Laurence Burnsed and Epidemiologist with the Oklahoma Department of Health.

After 2 weeks in the hospital, the child has fully recovered. But her grandmother says it was a very scary time.

The Health Department says they had reports of 100 cases of _E. coli_ in 2017.

[It is not specifically stated that a strain of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ was involved here but with the bloody diarrhea, it is most certainly the case.

This cluster is not related to the ongoing romaine lettuce-associated EHEC outbreak. Day care centers can be sites for person-to-person transmission clusters of a variety of enteric illnesses such as EHEC rather than the cluster being entirely food-related. Indeed, in most outbreaks, secondary household-related transmission of EHEC occurs.
