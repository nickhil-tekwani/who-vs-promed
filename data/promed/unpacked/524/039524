Dutch authorities on Sunday [16 Nov 2014] banned the transport of poultry throughout the Netherlands after finding a strain of bird flu that can jump the species barrier to humans at a farm in the middle of the country. "This highly pathogenic variant of avian influenza [AI] is very dangerous for bird life," the government said in a statement. "The disease can be transmitted from animals to humans."

The disease was 1st identified at a battery poultry farm with 150 000 hens in the village of Hekendorp late on Saturday [15 Nov 2014]. Authorities are currently destroying the birds. The variant, which has not been named, is dangerous for all birds and fatal for chickens.

Earlier outbreaks of bird flu in Europe and Asia have been highly contagious and have infected humans, prompting fears that bird flu outbreaks could spark a major epidemic.

Authorities on Sunday [16 Nov 2014] morning imposed a 72-hour ban on transporting all poultry products, including birds, eggs, dung and used straw to and from poultry farms throughout the country. They also imposed a countrywide ban on all kinds of hunting. The ban will remain in force for 30 days for the 16 poultry farms within a 10-km radius of the site of the outbreak, and all of them will be subject to enhanced security measures for visitors and regularly checked for signs of bird flu.

Some 10 000 chickens were destroyed in March 2014 after bird flu was found at a farm in the eastern Dutch province of Gelderland. Earlier this month [November 2014], Germany detected cases of the highly pathogenic H5N8 bird flu strain which has hit Asia but has never been reported in Europe. In September 2014, Russia reported the 1st cases of H5N1, another dangerous strain, in nearly 2 years.

[Thanks to subscriber Y Shamir, DVM, for drawing our attention to this information.

The Netherlands, a prominent poultry producer/exporter, suffered a devastating HPAI H7N7 epizootic in 2003, with some human infections, one fatal. Since then, all published Dutch avian influenza outbreaks have reportedly been caused by various AI strains of low pathogenicity.

Laboratory results of the current strain are anticipated soon. The Dutch media underlined the information on "this variant being dangerous for human heath".

The village of Hekendorp is in the province Utrecht, central Netherlands. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2959714,104. - Mod.AS]
