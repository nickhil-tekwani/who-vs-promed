Hong Kong health officials reported today [9 Apr 2022] on a human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in the mainland.

The case involves a 53-year-old female living in Zhenjiang City in Jiangsu Province who had visited a live poultry market before onset. She developed symptoms on 24 Mar [2022] and was admitted for treatment on 26 Mar [2022]. She is in critical condition.

This is the 12th case reported in China this year [2022] and 76th case reported since 2014.

Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans may range from flu-like symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) to severe respiratory illness (e.g., chest infection). Eye infection (conjunctivitis) and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) have also been reported. The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and even death.

Two people who are hospitalized in critical condition in mainland China have tested positive for H5N6 bird flu, raising the number of cases so far this year [2022] to 19, officials say. The spike in human cases has led to calls for increased surveillance.

The 1st case, a 28-year-old man from Puyang in Henan Province, developed symptoms on 18 Mar [2022] after exposure to live poultry, according to the Hong Kong Health Department. He was hospitalized the next day and remains in critical condition.

The other case, a 53-year-old woman from Zhenjiang City in Jiangsu Province, fell ill on 24 Mar [2022] after visiting a live poultry market. She was hospitalized 2 days later and is still in critical condition.

Other details about the cases were not released by the Chinese government, which often takes weeks or months to announce new cases.

The Chinese government disclosed last month [March 2022] that a 12-year-old girl and a 79-year-old man died of H5N6 bird flu in December [2021]. Both lived in Liuzhou, a city in the Guangxi region, and visited a live poultry market before falling ill.

Only 78 people have been infected with H5N6 bird flu since the 1st confirmed case in 2014, but most infections were diagnosed during the past year. At least 19 cases, including 5 deaths, have been reported so far this year [2022].

H5N6 bird flu is known to cause severe illness in humans of all ages and has killed nearly half of those infected, including children and young adults. The outcome in most of the other cases has not been disclosed, and only 8 people are known to have recovered.

There are no confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission, though a woman who tested positive last year [2021] denied having contact with live poultry.

"The increasing trend of human infection with avian influenza virus has become an important public health issue that cannot be ignored," researchers said in a study published by China's Center for Disease Control in September [2021]. The study highlighted several mutations in 2 recent cases of H5N6 bird flu.

Thijs Kuiken, a professor at Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, expressed concern about the rising number of cases. "It could be that this variant is a little more infectious (to people) ... or there could be more of this virus in poultry at the moment and that's why more people are getting infected," Kuiken told Reuters in October [2021].

Earlier that month [October 2021], the World Health Organization said the risk of human-to-human transmission remains low because H5N6 has not acquired the ability for sustained transmission between humans. However, increased surveillance is "urgently required" to better understand the rising number of human cases, the spokesperson said.

[The above report mentions 2 new cases of avian influenza A/H5N6 who are in critical condition in mainland China, increasing the total cases in 2022 to 13. Accordingly, from 2014 to date, 77 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by health authorities in mainland China.

According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia.

Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as the frequency of cases appears to be increasing. - Mod.UBA
