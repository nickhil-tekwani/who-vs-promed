Source of spoonbill botulism deaths traced to fish ponds
--------------------------------------------------------
TAIEPI: The latest crisis involving the mass die-off of black-faced
spoonbills in southern Taiwan's Tainan County will be over soon "if no new
cases are reported," an expert said yesterday.
Veterinarian Chi Wei-lien, who is helping an emergency center deal with the
latest crisis, said the source of the botulism that has been blamed for the
death of 71 birds so far can be traced to an area of fish ponds located
several kilometers north of the black-faced spoonbills preservation area in
the Chiku wetland reserve at the mouth of the Tsengwen River. "The reserve
and the fish pond are now environmentally safe for the birds," he said.
Judging from the locations of the three waves of deaths and the birds'
feeding patterns, he said, it can be assumed that one location in the fish
pond area is the source of infection, as 13 out of 20 specimens of clams,
fish, and soil collected there contained traces of botulinum [_Clostridium
botulinum_ bacteria? toxin? both? - Mod. AS], the pathogen that causes
botulism poisoning.
He said that among the first 53 deaths reported on 9 Dec 2002, 48 were in
the northern fish pond area and only 5 were in a fish pond area to the east
of the preserve. The number of birds in the second wave of deaths was
fewer, and they were found mostly in the eastern fish pond area. The third
and latest round of sick birds occurred mainly in the preserve area itself
between 1 and 5 Jan 2003.
National Taiwan Normal University, Professor Wang Ying, said that more than
80 per cent of the birds hunt for food in the evening and usually go to the
northern fish pond first and fly to the eastern one later. They return to
feed again just before dawn before flying back to the wetlands to spend the
day.
Chi said that it can be presumed that the endangered birds were most likely
to have eaten fish infected with botulism in the northern fish pond, as
most of the birds that died in the first wave of deaths were unable to
leave the northern fish pond. After volunteer firefighters and bird lovers
were mobilized to clean up the fish ponds, the botulism became less
virulent and the birds in the second wave managed to fly to the eastern
fish pond area, although they were still unable to return to the wetlands.
During the third round of deaths, the illness had become even more mild,
and the infected birds became sick only after returning from their feeding
grounds, Chi said.
He said that according to the measures for an epidemic, if no new cases are
reported after two incubation periods, it means that the epidemic has
ended. The incubation period for botulism can last as long as 7 days, so if
no new cases are reported since the latest cases 12 days ago, it can be
assumed that by Sunday, the crisis will be over.
Each year, a large number of the endangered birds migrate from the Korean
peninsula and northeastern mainland China to spend the winter at the Chiku
wetlands. A record number of 700 have arrived so far this year, but this is
the first time that the birds have died en masse.

[From this item it seems that "clams, fish and soil" are suspected by the
Taiwanese investigators to be the toxin source. It is not clear whether
this conclusion was based upon bacteria isolates or demonstrated toxin.
Previous press items (see 20030101.0001) mentioned Cl. botulinum type C as
the causative agent. - Mod.AS]
