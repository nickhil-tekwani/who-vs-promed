A mule deer buck harvested in hunt area 39 near Bull Mountain, about
23 miles north of Lysite, has tested positive for chronic wasting
disease (CWD), a brain disease known to affect some deer, elk and
moose. This is the 1st time that CWD has been detected in hunt area 39.

Personnel at the Wyoming Game and Fish Department Laboratory analyzed
samples taken as part of the department's annual CWD survey and
discovered positive results for the deer.

Hunt area 39 is bordered by endemic areas 164 and 37 that have had
deer test positive for CWD in previous years.

After a review of available scientific data, the World Health
Organization in December 1999 stated, "There is currently no evidence
that CWD in cervidae (deer and elk) is transmitted to humans." In
2004, Dr. Ermias Belay of the Center for Disease Control said, "The
lack of evidence of a link between CWD transmission and unusual cases
of CJD, [Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a human prion disease] despite
several epidemiological investigations, suggests that the risk, if
any, of transmission of CWD to humans is low." Nonetheless to avoid
risk, both organizations say parts or products from any animal that
looks sick and/or tests positive for CWD should not be eaten.

[This represents only a slight expansion of the disease. As this area
is bordered by 2 areas where the disease is believed to be endemic,
the slight expansion may not be unexpected. The press release kindly
documents where the numbered area is in relationship to other
landmarks, but it is not clear to this moderator where within that
numbered area the animal was harvested. Was it near the border of
that area? Or was it in the center of that area? Knowing that would
help explain whether this is a slight expansion or an unexpected
finding. - Mod.TG]
