70 percent of onion crop in Maharashtra damaged by disease
----------------------------------------------------------
Diseases caused by unseasonal rains have ruined almost 70 percent of
the kharif (July to November) onion crop in Maharashtra in 2010.

The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) will now prepare a
list of do's and don'ts for farmers to avoid such a situation in
future, Umesh Shrivastava, ICAR, said. Improper action to ward of the
ill-effects of untimely rains led to 2 diseases -- anthracnose and
purple blotch -- infecting onion crops, he said.

Water-logging in the "flat beds" of onion fields in the state, which
accounts for 30 percent of production of the staple vegetable in the
country, caused the 2 diseases, resulting in widespread damage, he
added. The problem was compounded by cloudy and humid weather
afterwards. ICAR said that even though farmers sprayed their onions
with fungicide this proved to be futile, as rains washed [it] away.

The diseases have reduced onion yields by almost 50 percent
triggering a drastic shortfall which in turn drove [up] prices in
retail markets.

[Purple blotch of onion is caused by the fungus _Alternaria porri_.
Crop losses depend on environmental conditions and may range from 25
to 90 percent. The damage may continue to develop post-harvest.
Symptoms include small, water-soaked lesions with purple centres on
leaves, leaf bases, and flower stalks, which expand and result in
necrotic patches. The disease is favoured by high humidity and often
occurs as a secondary infection on plants already affected by other
pathogens or pests (for example, onion thrips). The pathogen is
mostly spread with infected plant material and by mechanical means
(including insects and human activities). Disease management may
include fungicides, clean planting material, phytosanitation to
minimise inoculum, and crop rotation.

Anthracnose of onion (also called smudge, twister) is caused by the
fungi _Glomerella cingulata_ or _Colletotrichum circinans_. An
additional species (_Gibberella moniliformis_) has recently been
identified to be associated with a severe form of the disease in the
Philippines (see link below) where up to 100 percent crop losses have
been reported. Symptoms include water-soaked, pale yellow spots on
leaves, which expand lengthwise until covering the entire leaf blade;
affected leaves shrivel and droop. The pathogens survive on crop
debris and spread occurs mainly with infected plant material and by
mechanical means. Disease management may include removal of infected
crop debris to reduce inoculum, crop rotation, fungicides (although
effectiveness may be limited), biocontrol organisms (for example
_Trichoderma_), and cultural measures (reduction of moisture in the
crop). Some resistant or tolerant onion cultivars are being developed.
