What is unusual about this year's [2013-2014] flu season in Central New York is not the number of deaths, but the age of the people the virus is killing, says Dr Cynthia Morrow, Onondaga County's health commissioner. There have been 7 reported flu deaths in Onondaga, Madison, and Oswego counties. On average Onondaga County sees about 5 flu deaths each year, Morrow said. Typically more than 90 percent of the deaths occur in people over 65, she said.

This year all of Central New York flu deaths have occurred in middle-aged people. That's because the most widely circulating flu strain, H1N1 [influenza H1N1(pdm09) virus] is disproportionately affecting young and middle-aged adults nationwide, Morrow said. Some of the people who died had not been vaccinated. Last year in Onondaga there were no reported flu deaths in that age group, Morrow said.

No one knows for sure why H1N1, originally called "swine flu" when it surfaced in 2009 and caused a global pandemic, is hitting this age group so hard. Morrow said there has been speculation that older people may have been exposed to a comparable virus when they were younger and developed some immunity to H1N1. "While the number of deaths is not unusual, who is being impacted is very unusual," she said.

The flu vaccine is reformulated every year long before the flu season begins to target flu strains that may circulate. The reformulation process is based on educated guesswork. Some years the vaccine is very effective, other years not. The vaccine's effectiveness generally ranges from 50 percent to 70 percent. Data on the effectiveness of this year's [2013-2014] vaccine will not be released by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention until the end of the flu season.

The vaccine available this season does protect against H1N1. "The message we are trying to get out is the flu can be deadly to anybody," Morrow said. It's not too late to get vaccinated, she said. It takes about 2 weeks to build up immunity after getting a flu shot.

[As stated above, data on the effectiveness of this year's [2013-2014] vaccine will not be available from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention until the end of the flu season. Until these data are available, it will not be possible to determine whether the data from New York state are in any way exceptional. - Mod.CP
