The [deceased] uncle of an Iraqi girl who died [in January 2006] after
contracting the [H5N1 avian influenza] virus also had the disease, said US and
UN officials on Thu 16 Feb 2006, citing results of samples tested at a UN-
approved laboratory in Egypt.
The man died on 27 Jan 2006 in Iraq's northern Kurdistan region and lived in
the same house as his 15-year-old niece, who was confirmed as the country's
1st avian influenza-related death. They died 10 days apart.
"We learned today that the uncle's samples came back positive from Cairo for
avian influenza H5N1," said a US official, who declined to be identified
further because he was not authorized to release the information to the media.

_flu-10>
The US official said the tests did not indicate if the uncle had caught the
virus from his niece. To date there have been no confirmed cases that H5N1 has
mutated into a virus capable of being passed directly between humans. Experts
fear such a development could lead to a global pandemic.
An official from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization office confirmed
that the sample from the uncle had tested positive for H5N1 when analyzed by
the US Navy Medical Research Unit laboratory in the Egyptian capital. The Navy
lab is certified by the World Health Organization to conduct such tests. But
one further test must be carried out by a London laboratory certified by the
World Health Organization before the world body confirms that the uncle did in
fact have bird flu H5N1.
Talib Ali Elam, FAO's Cairo-based regional officer for animal health, said the
girl's family and uncle kept poultry in the district of Serkapkan in
Sulaimaniyah, a Kurdish province in northeastern Iraq. After their deaths, the
family "culled all chicken, geese, turkey, ducks in Serkapkan and 36 villages
around," said Elam, who visited the area as part of a UN-led delegation. Elam
said the U.S. Navy laboratory is working through more than 100 human samples
from Iraq and at least 24 samples from birds and cats.

The Ministry of Health in Iraq has confirmed the country's 2nd case of human
infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case, which was fatal,
occurred in a 39-year-old man from the northern province of Sulaimaniyah. He
developed symptoms on 18 Jan 2005 and died on 27 Jan 2006. He was the uncle of
the country's initial case, a 15-year-old girl who died 17 Jan 2006, and
provided care for her during her illness. He also had a documented history of
exposure to infected domestic birds.
Problems with the shipment of patient specimens for external diagnostic
confirmation have been solved. Samples from an initial 15 patients under
investigation for possible infection were tested today at a US Naval Medical
Research Unit located in Cairo, Egypt. Apart from the 39-year-old fatal case,
all test results were negative.
A 2nd shipment of samples from additional patients under investigation arrived
yesterday in Cairo. Results are expected within the next few days. Duplicate
samples are being sent to a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom
for further testing and analysis.

[3] "Genetic risk"
Date: Fri 17 Feb 2006
From: Emily Beeler <ebeeler@ladhs.org>

In regard to the family clusters of human H5N1 sparing one spouse:
Perhaps childhood exposure to a weaker form of H5N1 (or H9N2) would confer
immunity on one spouse and not the other. It would be interesting if this
apparent immunity of one spouse only occurs when the husband and wife grew up
far apart -- in separate towns or villages.

[4] "Genetic risk"
Date: Fri 17 Feb 2006
From: "Ernest Gould" <eag@ceh.ac.uk>

With reference to the ProMED-mail avian flu comments on the family in which
the mother did not become infected but the children and the father developed
the disease, is it possible that there is some form of antibody-mediated
enhancement occurring, i.e. in a manner similar to what happens with dengue
haemorrhagic fever? If something of this nature was happening, a genetic risk
could be an additional contributory factor.

[The original report, (07) below, said:
"...the mother suggested she was spared because she did not eat chicken when
the rest of the family feasted on the sick birds. She said she had high blood
pressure and avoided meat. But ... her mother-in-law [70, recalled] "Many
people ate that chicken. I ate the chicken..."
My comment is that either it was a very large chicken, or the infectious virus
dose is rather low. In the latter case, there ought to be very many more human
cases occurring in countries with infected poultry. - Mod.JW]
