Infected garlic from China stirs up trouble
-------------------------------------------
The customs department in Malda [West Bengal] today [18 Jun 2009]
dropped the process of destroying infected garlic that was being
imported to India from China illegally. Though the district
administration had provided a burning ghat, hundreds of locals
protested and did not allow the customs department to quarantine the
fungus-infected garlic.

Identifying the seized garlic as infected by harmful fungus, the
plant quarantine departmental officials claimed that: "This Chinese
produce may badly affect agriculture activities in India."

Following the directives of the Central government, the assistant
commissioner of customs in Malda had informed the district
administration, seeking barren land to quarantine the seized garlic.
While the land and land reforms department selected land, it had been
decided that on [16 Jun 2009] the infected garlic would be burnt and
buried properly at the burning ghat.

At present, the administrative and customs officials are in search of
barren land on which to quarantine the garlic.

[A number of fungi can affect garlic (_Allium sativum_), including
_Botrytis_, _Penicillium_, _Sclerotium_, and _Peronospora_ species
causing rotting, decay, or mildew symptoms. Most of the major
diseases of this crop are soil borne.

It is not possible to guess the pathogen involved in West Bengal, but
even if the fungal species detected on the imported consignment is
already present in India, a new incursion must be prevented since it
may involve a different strain, for example with increased virulence
or fungicide resistances. The initial plan of burning and burying the
infected garlic would have been the most effective way to prevent
spread of the fungal incursion. Unfortunately, lack of public
awareness has interfered with this.

Quarantining the material on vacant land could only be effective if
sufficient distance and/or barriers to garlic and related crops
(onion, leek) can be achieved and spread of the fungus for example by
wind, insects, or human activities can be prevented. The consignment
could then only be used safely if processed by methods, which
reliably destroy fungal pathogens and their spores (such as some high
heat or radiation treatments), and the site as well as all materials
would have to be kept under quarantine or sanitised afterwards. These
efforts appear to be out of proportion in the situation described
above.
