SINGAPORE: The Environment Ministry (ENV) said that 892 cases of dengue
fever were reported in the first 6 months of this year, compared to 291
last year. None of the cases this year have been fatal so far, but this
year's weekly average of 34 is 3 times last year's and about 30 per cent
more than 1999's. At the peak of a dengue outbreak in 1998, 100 cases were
reported each week.
At present, cases have been reported in 10 areas - Bedok North Road/Bedok
North Avenue 1, Lorong 40 Geylang, Joo Chiat Place/ Mangis Road, Hougang
Avenue 3/Tampines Road, Race Course Road/Rangoon Road, Newton Road/ Surrey
Road, Gloucester Road/Dorset Road, Jalan Binchang/Jalan Berjaya near
Bishan, Lorong 8 Toa Payoh and Little India MRT site. Two weeks ago, in
Thomson Walk in Upper Thomson, ENV officials found mosquito breeding spots
after residents there complained about a rise in the number of insects,
which they blamed on a nearby construction site. Breeding spots were also
found at the site. The Ministry has taken action against the contractors.
Symptoms of dengue include fever, severe joint aches, headaches, skin rash,
nausea, and vomiting. The ministry has advised the public to check their
premises for stagnant water daily and to remove any found, as the _Aedes_
mosquito, which carries the dengue virus, breeds in clean water, such as in
vases, plant bowls, pails, jars, and choked drains.
