24 Oct 2015 Ghana: Bad science and toxic politics; misstep that ruined Ghana's Ebola vaccine trial http://graphic.com.gh/features/opinion/52057-bad-science-toxic-politics-misstep-that-ruined-ghana-s-ebola-vaccine-trial.html#sthash.lCtza43p.dpuf
[Much of Ghana's leadership has staunchly denied their support to the planned Ebola vaccine trial. This has left the trials -- already planned and ready to go -- unable to move forward. According to the principal investigators, "We have cancelled 2 of the Ebola vaccine trials, and are about to cancel the last of the trials. Our colleagues in other African countries have recruited more than enough participants needed for the 2 trials, so the companies developing these vaccines have moved on. We are waiting for Parliament and the GAAS [Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences] to make up their minds. The FDA refused to provide us with the permit to import the vaccines although we had approval for the protocol we submitted."]

22 Oct 2015 Liberia: Health education gaps in post-Ebola Liberia
http://allafrica.com/stories/201510230999.html
[According to Liberian journalist Samuel G Dweh, there is a need for health education in schools, so Liberians can better understand the medical names of conditions, their treatment, and their causes.]

21 Oct 2015 Nigeria: Nigeria celebrates 1st anniversary of Ebola-free declaration
http://allafrica.com/stories/201510211133.html
[1 year ago Nigeria was declared Ebola-free by the World Health Organization (WHO). Ebola virus was introduced into Nigeria on 20 Jul 2014 when an infected Liberian man arrived by air in Lagos, Africa's most populous city. The man, who died in hospital 5 days later, set off a chain of transmission that infected a total of 19 people, of whom 7 died. - Mod.LK]

21 Oct 2015 Sierra Leone: Loss, health, and money -- Ebola survivors' greatest concerns
http://allafrica.com/stories/201510231429.html
[It is now more than a year following the onset of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in Sierra Leone. EVD survivors find the loss of loved ones, their own health, and access to money to be their greatest concerns. However, the stigma of having survived EVD also haunts them, and prevents them from truly reentering society in a meaningful way.]

22 Oct 2015 UK: Doctor treating Ebola nurse had to make mercy dash across Atlantic after she had relapse
http://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/doctor-treating-ebola-nurse-made-mercy-dash-across-atlantic-after-she-had-relapse-a3096666.html
[Dr Michael Jacobs, the doctor leading the Royal Free London Hospital team treating the Ebola-virus-disease (EVD)-relapsed nurse made an immediate return to Britain as soon as he learned of her relapse, interrupting his speech on EVD at a doctor's conference. [The nurse] remains in isolation in a protective plastic "tent" in the isolation room, and the Ebola virus remains in her brain and spinal column. However, she is able to talk to staff, she has started to eat again and to use an iPad. According to Dr Jacobs, "We are delighted with her progress. I think she has got a long recovery ahead of her. She has had some serious neurological complications from the meningitis. She will be with us in the Royal Free Hospital for quite a while still." Because previously used antibody therapies are not suitable to be used on the brain, the nurse was the 1st patient in the world to be treated with the experimental antiviral drug GS-5734.]

[Gilead Sciences, Inc. fulfilled a request for compassionate access to GS-5734, a novel nucleotide analogue in development for the potential treatment of Ebola Virus Disease... EVDGS-5734 was discovered as part of Gilead's program to screen compounds in its libraries for activity against a range of potential emerging viruses, including Ebola. In collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), the company identified GS-5734 in vitro activity against the Ebola virus. In animal studies conducted at USAMRIID, treatment initiated on day 3 post-infection with Ebola virus resulted in 100 percent survival of monkeys. (Excerpted from http://www.gilead.com/news/press-releases/2015/10/gilead-provides-update-on-investigational-compound-gs5734-for-the-treatment-of-ebola-virus-disease) ] - Mod.LK

22 Oct 2015 UK: Ebola nurse [PC] faces long recovery, says doctor - video
http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/oct/22/ebola-nurse-pauline-cafferkey-faces-long-recovery-says-doctor-video
[According to Dr Michael Jacobs, the lead doctor in the Royal Free London Hospital's care of the nurse who suffered a relapse of Ebola virus disease (EVD) which the hospital thought she had cleared in January 2015 and discharged her from the hospital "Ebola-free," she not only gave consent for her medical information to be shared, but she wants the information to be shared because it will help others dealing with post-Ebola symptoms. She was not "re-infected" with the virus, but the virus remaining in her body after she was discharged as "Ebola-free" became reactivated. She cannot get out of bed, but can eat a little. Ebola virus is in the central nervous system (CNS). Early on in the current hospitalization, there was a low level of Ebola virus in her blood, but Dr Jacobs is not sure if the virus is actually replicating or "spilling over" from the CNS.]

["In most cases, there is no specific treatment for viral meningitis. Most people who get viral meningitis completely recover on their own, within 7 to 10 days. However, people with meningitis caused by certain viruses, such as herpesvirus and influenza, may benefit from treatment with an antiviral medication. Antibiotics do not help viral infections, so they are not useful in the treatment of viral meningitis. However, antibiotics are very important when treating bacterial meningitis."

21 Oct 2015 UK: Ebola nurse [PC] nearly died from meningitis, doctors say
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/21/ebola-nurse-pauline-cafferkey-condition-serious-but-stable-royal-free-hospital
[According to doctors, the British nurse who contracted Ebola 9 months ago in West Africa, came close to death from meningitis caused by the lingering virus. Her condition has significantly improved, and she is now able to talk with medical personnel, sit up in bed, and use her iPad. Her doctors say they expect her to make a slow, but full, recovery.
According to Dr Michael Jacobs, the lead specialist treating her, "The virus re-emerged around the brain and around the spinal column to cause meningitis. She developed some serious neurological complications. We didn't know what the trajectory was -- if the virus in the blood was heralding the fact that something was going to happen or was it just what we would call incidental, because we have never seen anything like this before, we were not sure what was going to happen, whether this was going to turn into full-blown Ebola virus -- and let's be absolutely clear about this: it did not." Dr Jacobs also said he hoped PC's immune system would fight off and eliminate the virus entirely.
The latent Ebola virus has not previously been known to trigger a life-threatening illness so long after the original infection. Dan Bausch, who leads the epidemic disease team for the World Health Organization (WHO), said meningitis had been caused in the acute stages of the virus, but this had only happened in the initial infection. However, there may have been similar complications in survivors in West Africa that have gone undetected because of poor medical systems.

21 Oct 2015 USA: Top US Ebola doctor: country not ready for next outbreak http://dc.medill.northwestern.edu/blog/2015/10/21/ebola-one-year-later-preparedness-not-enough/#sthash.Ln0b1Aqo.dpuf
[According to Dr Bruce Ribner, who was named "America's Top Ebola Doctor" by Time Magazine and who is head of the infectious disease unit at Emory University Hospital, speaking on behalf of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), the Ebola outbreak of 2014, as well as outbreaks of other diseases, remain a real threat to the USA. Now that the Ebola virus disease (EVD) pandemic has retreated to the background, AAMC states maintaining funding and education to better respond to the next pandemic is imperative.]

23 Oct 2015 USA: Doctor to patient: an Ebola survivor's odyssey
http://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/news/bedside-patient-ebola-survivors-odyssey
[Dr Ian Crozier is a walking example of the issues involved with contracting Ebola virus disease (EVD), both during infection and post-infection, and he presents a vivid example of the damaging, long-term consequences of EVD, which are still inadequately understood.
Dr Crozier was a volunteer physician with the World Health Organization (WHO) in Sierra Leone, where he diligently worked with EVD patients in the fall of 2014. At the outbreak's peak, the team helped care for overwhelming numbers of EVD patients and those suspected of having EVD. Then, on 7 Sep 2014, he developed a fever, headache, and extreme fatigue. On 9 Sep 2014, he was air-lifted to Emory Hospital (USA, Georgia). He developed multisystem organ failure.
According to Dr Crozier, he still suffers from an array of disturbing consequences, including eye problems, hearing loss with tinnitus, short-term memory loss, seizures, and sleep regulation problems, he said.
Dr Crozier was one of the sickest patients to survive EVD. However, even months after his apparent recovery, EVD still had a few surprises for him, one of which was the disturbing finding of live replicating EBOV in his vitreous humor (clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina), months after his blood tested negative for EBOV, which turned his naturally blue eyes to green. Yet, he continues to have a positive attitude towards his EVD infection.
During an appearance at Stanford University (California), Dr Crozier recounted his astonishing recovery, during which he rebounded from a tortuous period of being hooked to a ventilator and a kidney dialysis machine, experiencing abnormal heart rhythms, and developing severe encephalopathy that left him delirious and then unconscious for weeks, ultimately suffering several hemorrhagic strokes. According to Dr Crozier, "This virus is teaching us in this last 10th of this last mile, as it stutters along, that we have a lot to learn."

22 Oct 2015 USA: Just why has Ebola been so terrible in West Africa?
http://www.digitaljournal.com/science/just-why-has-ebola-been-so-terrible-in-west-africa/article/447313
[According to Michael Kurilla, MD, PhD, the director of the Office of Biodefense Research Affairs and associate director for Biodefense Product Development for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), there are 5 reasons why the 2014-2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic has been so devastating and difficult to bring under control:
1. The areas affected had no previous experience with Ebola.
2. The outbreak occurred in an urban setting whereas the preceding 23 EVD outbreaks had been in rural areas. Because of this difference, there have been more potential new virus victims. In previous EVD outbreaks, 1 infected person would come into contact with an average of 8 people. However, with the current outbreak, at its peak, a typical person would come into contact with between 50 and 75 people.
3. There were very poor-to-nonexistent public-health infrastructures which could not adequately treat the larger numbers of EVD patients.
4. Institutional support was lacking. As an example of this problem, Dr Kurilla relates a situation when the South African government sent medical supplies to Sierra Leone in December 2014, yet the cargo sat, unpacked [sic - probably meaning unopened], until March 2015.
5. "Unique cultural practices" also became an issue in dealing with the 2014 EVD outbreak. One result of this is the lack of undertakers in most West African regions, with funerals being handled by families. Some of the problematic local customs dictate cadavers lie in homes for several weeks before being buried. Some customs require the body is to be washed prior to burial, a time when infections of family members and others handling the body can occur. Incineration is, from an infectious disease point of view, the best way to handle a burial. However, incineration also requires a break with established traditions.
In addition, the EVD itself is a difficult disease to address because of the very nature of the virus, including it being an rNA virus with the ability to rapidly replicate, and the virus's ability to remain in immune-privileged areas of the body (including the vitreous humor of the eyes, gonads, central nervous system, and breast milk), long after blood tests have shown no virus present.]

Research, funding
-----------------
23 Oct 2015: NEI team studying Ebola's impact on the eye
https://nihrecord.nih.gov/newsletters/2015/10_23_2015/story3.htm
[The US National Eye Institute (NEI) will be sending a team of clinicians and technical experts from the National Eye Institute to Monrovia (Liberia) where the team will be investigating the long-term effects of Ebola virus disease (EVD) on the eye among hundreds of survivors following the 2014 West African outbreak. The NEI research is part of a larger study, PREVAIL III (Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines in Liberia), sponsored by NIAID (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) and the Liberian Ministry of Health.
The study will be conducted at multiple sites in Liberia, where PREVAIL III will aim to enroll 7500 people, including 1500 survivors and up to 6000 of their close contacts to serve as controls. It is hoped the findings will determine if survivors are immune from future Ebola infections and will assess the risk of transmission of the virus to close contacts and sexual partners.]

23 Oct 2015 Regional: AfDB approves a USD 33.3-million regional Post Ebola Recovery Social Investment Fund
http://allafrica.com/stories/201510231507.html
[On 21 Oct 2015, the African Development Bank (AfDB) Board of Executive Directors approved a USD 33.3-million grant to set up a Post Ebola Recovery Social Investment Fund (PERSIF) intended to support the implementation of the National Post Ebola Recovery strategies of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.
The fund combines contributions from the African Development Fund, which is the AfDB's fund for emerging markets as well as countries in transition (a USD 25 million grant); the US State Department (USD 5 million grant); and AfDB's Rural Water and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI) Trust Fund (USD 3.4 million).
Funding from the US State Department will support economic and livelihood development for women, girls, orphans, and vulnerable children from Ebola communities in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia.]

23 Oct 2015: The role of connectivity in emergencies: a case study of Ebola
http://www.ictworks.org/2015/10/23/the-role-of-connectivity-in-emergencies-a-case-study-of-ebola/
[The Ebola epidemic showed a shortage of ICT (information and communications technology) capability in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. This prevented or greatly minimized access to -- and the exchange of -- information, real-time case management and contact tracing, outbreak mapping, community mobilization, supply, and logistics management, and the day-to-day operations of relief organizations.
In May 2015, Inveneo -- in partnership with Facebook, the Paul G Allen Family Foundation, Cisco, EveryLayer, and NetHope -- was successful in completing its efforts to deliver 100 new high-speed Internet connections to government and non-government organizations in Sierra Leone and Liberia as part of the joint Ebola Response Connectivity Initiative (ERCI).
Inveneo's model is based on working closely with local partners (usually IT [information technology] companies and entrepreneurs) to build and expand using local and established capacity. Whenever possible, the broadband and towers from in-country mobile network operators (MNOs) are used to reduce costs and expand the existing infrastructure.]

24 Oct 2015: 4 new viruses found in hunt for 'next Ebola'
http://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-independent/20151024/282041915985363/TextView
[Scientists leading global efforts to prevent "the next Ebola" have found 4 new viruses in Borneo's wildlife with the potential to ignite new disease outbreaks in humans. According to the US government-backed researchers who uncovered the viruses, their discovery strengthens the argument for cracking down on the illegal wildlife trade.]
[One virus is a SARS-like coronavirus that was discovered in 2 species of bats sampled in Malaysian Borneo. Also identified were 2 previously unknown enteroviruses in Borneo orangutans and a new rhabdovirus. - Mod.LK]
