There has been no direct response to the request appended to the preceding
post in this series for information on the identity of the etiological
agent responsible for the suspected outbreak of hantavirus-associated
disease in Taiwan. The initial reports suggested that Seoul virus might be
the hantavirus responsible for this outbreak, despite the fact that this
virus is less often associated with respiratory involvement than renal and
hemorrhagic manifestations. ProMED-mail has now heard indirectly that
samples from the affected individuals have proved to be seronegative.
Consequently confirmation is lacking that this outbreak is a consequence of
hantavirus infection.
