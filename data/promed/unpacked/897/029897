Two cattle in south central North Dakota's Emmons County have died of
anthrax, the 1st cases in North Dakota this year [2006]. State
veterinarian Susan Keller said on Wednesday [21 Jun 2006?] that the
cattle were in a herd south west of Linton that has now been
quarantined. "This is a warning for North Dakota producers to talk
with their veterinarians about having their animals vaccinated,"
Keller said.
"This is especially true for producers in areas of the state that
have recorded anthrax in the past." Last year [2005], more than 500
animals in 16 North Dakota counties died from anthrax, the worst
outbreak in state history, according to the state Agriculture
Department.
Last week, 6 cattle in north western Minnesota's Kittson County --
across the Red River from North Dakota's Pembina County -- died of
the disease. Keller said anthrax usually appears in very wet or very
dry conditions, when dormant bacteria spores in the soil are
disturbed. Animals that consume the spores are exposed to the
disease. "Several different anthrax vaccines are effective and
readily available," Keller said. "It usually takes about a week for
immunity to be established."
