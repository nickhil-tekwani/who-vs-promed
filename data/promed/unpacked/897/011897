Burma denies bird flu report, but on alert
------------------------------------------
Officials in Burma have denied reports of a possible outbreak of
Asia's deadly bird flu, but are on alert against it.
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation had asked
Rangoon to check a report on an opposition web site that thousands of
chickens had suddenly died in southern Burma.
However, a director of the Livestock Breeding and Veterinary
Department, says no trace of the disease has been found in the
country.
Avian influenza, which has killed 47 people in Asia, has ravaged
poultry flocks in neighbouring Thailand and other countries in the
region for more than a year.
The Norway-based opposition Democratic Voice of Burma reported at the
weekend that thousands of chickens had suddenly died in Mon State and
local residents feared it could be bird flu.

[On 16 Feb 2004, the Livestock Breeding and Veterinary Department
(LBVD) in the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, Government of the
Union of Myanmar, sent to the OIE an official report about the
absence of HPAI infection. It would help if a similar reassuring
notification could be sent now. - Mod.AS]
