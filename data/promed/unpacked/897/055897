[As we have seen previously in South Africa, and significantly in the
Garissa area of Kenya, heavy rainfall, as indicated in the report, often
but not always precedes an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (see Zimbabwe
reports below). It is also important that humans don't act as sentinels for
animals, which occurs when veterinary services are weak and human cases
alert local veterinary authorities to take action. It appears that an
effective vaccination program may be getting under way, and, hopefully,
this will nip the spread of this disease. - Mod.PC]
