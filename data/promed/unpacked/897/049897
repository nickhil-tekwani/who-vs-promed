Sea star wasting disease is a general description of a set of symptoms that are found in sea stars. Typically, lesions appear in the ectoderm followed by decay of tissue surrounding the lesions, which leads to eventual fragmentation of the body and death. A deflated appearance can precede other morphological signs of the disease. All of these symptoms are also associated with ordinary attributes of unhealthy stars and can arise when an individual is stranded too high in the intertidal zone (for example) and simply desiccates. "True" wasting disease will be present in individuals that are found in suitable habitat, often in the midst of other individuals that might also be affected. The progression of wasting disease can be rapid, leading to death within a few days, and its effects can be devastating on sea star populations. The proximal cause of the disease, when pathological studies have been done, is typically a bacterium (_Vibrio_), although a recent wasting event on the east coast of the United States has been attributed to a virus. The ultimate cause is not clear, although such events are often associated with warmer than typical water temperatures, as was the case for the major die-off in southern California in 1983-1984 and again (on a lesser scale) in 1997-1998. Following the 1983-1984 event, the ochre star, _Pisaster ochraceus_, was virtually absent along southern California shorelines for years.

As of summer 2013, there is evidence that we are at the onset of another wasting event and one that is particularly troubling because of its spatial extent. MARINe monitoring groups have documented wasting in _Pisaster ochraceus_ from Alaska through California. Two common attributes for many of the sites are: (1) the period prior to wasting was characterized by warm water temperatures, and (2) the effects are dramatic.

Sea stars and _P. ochraceus_ in particular have effects on the community that are vastly disproportionate to their abundance. _P. ochraceus_ was the basis of the keystone species concept because of its potential to dramatically alter the rocky intertidal community in which it occurs. Our long-term monitoring data, including population estimates prior to the wasting event, in combination with our biodiversity surveys, will allow us to interpret change to communities that might result from severe population declines of _P. ochraceus_. The collected information will also be used to document recovery of both sea star populations and the community affected by way of the loss of sea stars.

Long-term trends in _P. ochraceus_ numbers at our monitored sites can be viewed by using our Interactive Map and Graphing Tool: http://data.piscoweb.org/marine1/seastardisease.html. Under "Long Term Graph Type" select "species counts data," and under "plot type" select "pisaster": http://data.piscoweb.org/marine1/intertidalmap.html.

Our research group is concentrating on:

Documenting the presence of sea star wasting symptoms by means of submitted reports, our own sampling as part of MARINe [<www.marine.gov/>] Long-Term Monitoring, and our newly established Rapid Assessment Surveys of the outbreak.

Developing a spatial/temporal map of the outbreak showing the location of affected populations and (when possible) the onset of symptoms for each location. This will allow for an evaluation of potential hypotheses concerning the cause of the disease. For example, if the outbreak started from a single location, its cause is likely to be different from a situation where there were multiple initiation points.

Other research groups are addressing the pathology and infectiousness of wasting. These groups include Cornell University (Harvell and Hewson), the University of Rhode Island (Gomez), Brown University (Wessel), Western Washington University (Miner), and the Seattle Aquarium.

[Mass mortalities of echinoids (starfish) as a result of disease have been widely reported from all over the world. Wasting disease has been observed in sea stars in southern California periodically during warm-water years since it was 1st recognized in 1978 and was especially prevalent during the 1982-1984 El Nino.

The MARINe team would like to increase the number of sites where long-term sea star data are collected, and thus they welcome information from individuals who spend time diving. But in order to ensure data consistency from outer contributors, they have put together a set of sampling protocols as a PDF: http://www.eeb.ucsc.edu/pacificrockyintertidal/data-products/sea-star-wasting/WastingDiseaseDataSheetAndProtocol_2013_1119.pdf.
