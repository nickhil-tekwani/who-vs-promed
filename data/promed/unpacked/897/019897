The 1st case of murine typhus occurring in New South Wales (NSW),
Australia since the 1940s has been reported in a 20 year old rural man
who became ill after contact with a pet rat. The case is the 1st in
Australia of murine typhus causing isolated meningoencephalitis with
raised intracranial pressure, neurologists said.

The man, from the mid-north coast of NSW, recovered after antibiotic
treatment and 17 days in hospital, according to the report in today's
[20 Jun 2011] Medical Journal of Australia [Med J Australia 2011;
194(12): 652-4]. "The case illustrates that murine typhus should be
considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with
'aseptic' meningitis or meningoencephalitis with or without raised
intracranial pressure," the authors said.

Murine typhus has been largely confined to south west Western
Australia but outbreaks have occurred in south east Queensland, and
the 1st case of murine typhus in [the state of] Victoria was reported
7 years ago [Med J Australia 2004; 180(9): 482. Available at
http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/180_09_030504/letters_030504_fm-1.html].
However, neurological complications were uncommon, the specialists
said.

[_Rickettsia_ are small obligate intracellular parasites that are
maintained in animal and arthropod reservoirs and transmitted by
arthropod vectors (ticks, fleas, lice, or mites) to humans.

Murine typhus, which occurs throughout the world, is a fleaborne
rickettsial disease caused by the _Rickettsia typhi_. Rats are the
primary animal reservoir of _R. typhi_; however, other mammals, such
as free-ranging cats, dogs, and opossums and their fleas can maintain
this microorganism in areas where rats and rat fleas are absent (Azad
AF, Radulovic S, Higgins JA, et al: Flea-borne rickettsioses: ecologic
considerations. Emerg Infect Dis 1997; 3(3): 319-27; available at
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627639/).

Humans are usually infected by contact with infected flea feces,
either by inoculation into excoriated fleabites, inhalation, or
ingestion. Symptoms include fever, headache, chills, vomiting, nausea,
myalgias, and rash. The illness usually resolves within 3 weeks, even
if untreated. Some patients are sick enough to be hospitalized in an
intensive care unit, however, and up to 4 per cent of hospitalized
patients will die from the infection. Treatment is doxycycline.
Prevention is directed at control of flea vectors and animal
reservoirs.

Neurologic complications are considered rare in murine typhus and
include meningitis and/or encephalitis
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9776466). Analysis of
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may show a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis,
normal glucose, and mildly elevated protein
(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1469-0691.2002.00502.x/pdf).
However, patients with epidemic typhus often have neurologic symptoms
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627627/pdf/9284381.pdf).

Epidemic typhus, caused by _Rickettsia prowazekii_, is a severe acute
febrile illness that is often life-threatening. Outbreaks of epidemic
typhus occur in developing countries, where the human body louse,
_Pediculis humanus_, has been associated with human-to-human
transmission. Epidemic typhus is rare in developed countries and is
said not to occur in Australia
(http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/180_09_030504/letters_030504_fm-1.html).
However, in the US, the eastern flying squirrel, _Glaucomys volans_,
has been shown to harbor _R. prowazekii_, and sporadic infections of
humans in the US have been attributed to transmission to humans by
squirrel ectoparasites or their feces
(http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/6/979.full.pdf).

Although the treatment for murine typhus and epidemic typhus is the
same, DNA sequencing of PCR products has been used to provide a
definitive differentiation of these closely related etiologic agents
that are cross-reactive serologically
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC95923/) and that can
both cause infections with similar clinical presentations
(http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/6/979.full.pdf).
