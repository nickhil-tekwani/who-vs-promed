North Korea has confirmed 15 more deaths and hundreds of thousands of additional patients with fevers as it mobilizes more than a million health and other workers to try to suppress the country's first COVID-19 outbreak, state media reported on Sunday [15 May 2022].

After maintaining a widely disputed claim that it's been coronavirus-free for more than 2 years, North Korea announced on Thursday [12 May 2022] that it had found its first COVID-19 patients since the pandemic began. It said a fever has spread across the country "explosively" since late April [2022] but hasn't disclosed exactly how many COVID-19 cases were found. Some experts say North Korea lacks the diagnostic kits needed to test a large number of suspected COVID-19 patients.

The additional deaths reported on Sunday [15 May 2022] took the country's reported fever-related fatalities to 42. The official Korean Central News Agency also reported that another 296 180 people with fevers had been tallied, taking the reported total to 820 620.

The outbreak has triggered concern about a humanitarian crisis in North Korea, because most of the country's 26 million people are believed to be unvaccinated against the coronavirus and its public health-care system has been in shambles for decades. Some experts say North Korea might suffer huge fatalities if it doesn't immediately receive outside shipments of vaccines, medicines, and other medical supplies.

Since Thursday [12 May 2022], North Korea has imposed a nationwide lockdown to fight the virus. Observers say that could further strain the country's fragile economy, which has suffered in recent years due to sharply reduced external trade caused by pandemic-related border shutdowns, UN economic sanctions over its nuclear program, and its own management. In a meeting on the outbreak on Saturday [14 May 2022], North Korean leader Kim Jong Un described the outbreak as a "great upheaval" and called for unity between the government and people to stabilize the outbreak as quickly as possible.

The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said on Sunday [15 May 2022] that more than 1.3 million people have been engaged in works to examine and treat sick people and raise public awareness of hygiene. It said everyone with fevers and others with abnormal symptoms were being put in quarantine and treated. Of those with symptoms, 496 030 have recovered, while as of Saturday [14 May 2022], 324 550 were still receiving treatment, KCNA reported, citing the country's emergency epidemic prevention center.

State media reports said Kim and other senior North Korean officials are donating their private reserve medicines to support the country's anti-pandemic fight. During Saturday's [14 May 2022] meeting, Kim expressed optimism that the country could bring the outbreak under control, saying most transmissions are occurring within communities that are isolated from one another and not spreading from region to region.

North Korea on Monday reported 8 new deaths and 392 920 more people with fever symptoms amid a growing COVID-19 outbreak as leader Kim Jong Un blasted officials over delays in medicine deliveries and ordered his military to get involved in the pandemic response in the country's capital, Pyongyang.

The North's emergency anti-virus headquarters said more than 1.2 million people fell ill amid a rapid spread of fever since late April [2022], and about 564 860 are currently under quarantine. The 8 new deaths reported in the 24 hours through 6 pm Sunday [15 May 2022] brought its death toll to 50.

State media didn't specify how many of the fever cases and deaths were confirmed as COVID-19 cases. Experts say North Korea likely lacks testing supplies and equipment to confirm coronavirus infections in large numbers and is mostly relying on isolating people with symptoms at shelters. Experts say the failure to slow the virus could have dire consequences for North Korea, considering its poor health-care system. Its population of 26 million people are believed to be mostly unvaccinated after their government had shunned millions of shots offered by the UN-backed COVAX distribution program, likely over concerns related to international monitoring requirements.

North Korea acknowledged its 1st COVID-19 outbreak last Thursday [12 May 2022] when it announced that an unspecified number of people in Pyongyang tested positive for the omicron outbreak. It had previously held for more than 2 years to a widely doubted claim of a perfect record keeping out the virus that has spread to nearly every place in the world.

While North Korea could suffer huge fatalities if it doesn't quickly receive international shipments of medical supplies, it's not immediately clear whether the North's admission of the outbreak communicates a willingness to receive outside help.

South Korea has offered to send vaccines and other supplies, but Seoul officials say the North has not made such a request. But some experts say Kim's comments last week during another Politburo meeting, where he praised China's pandemic response and urged his officials to learn from it, suggest that the North could be more willing to accept help from its major ally. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said last week that Beijing was ready to offer North Korea help but said he had no information about any such request being made.

[2] Exit from the pandemic

As the virus accelerates its evolution, the humans capitulate. For 2.5 years, COVID-19 has been outrunning our response, getting more and more transmissible, reaching a level of infectiousness that few pathogens have ever attained. Instead of taking a stance of getting ahead of the virus, and outsmarting it, people have succumbed.

In recent months, we experienced a striking jump in transmissibility when the omicron (BA.1) variant became dominant, with at least a 3-fold increase in reproductive number beyond delta. Despite the hope that this might be reaching the upper limit of the virus's spreadability, we quickly transitioned to a BA.2 wave, with at least another jump of about 30% transmissibility, and now we are heading, in the United States, to a dominant subvariant known as BA.2.12.1, which is another 25% more transmissible than BA.2 and already accounting for close to 50% of new cases.

This surely constitutes a meaningful acceleration of the virus's evolution. There have been thousands of variants over the course of the pandemic, but only 5 major variants, affecting large populations of people, received Greek letter designations (alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron). Each of these previous variants had numerous sub-lineages, or mutations that might be considered relatives of the main variant but had no functional consequence: they did not increase transmissibility or pathogenicity. But with omicron, we have already seen multiple subvariants with heightened infectiousness: not just BA.2, BA.2.12.1, but also BA.4 and BA.5, which are leading to a new wave in South Africa.

As we watch the virus strikingly improve its ability to find new or repeat hosts, you would think it would be considered an urgent call for action. But instead, there has been a public perception that the pandemic is over, while at the same time, public health agencies are adopting the policy that we must "live with COVID".

No, we don't have to live with COVID, because the COVID we are seeing now is deeply concerning. While there has not been a surge in hospitalizations, they are clearly on the increase, with more than a 20% rise in the United States over the past 2 weeks. The proportion of people getting hospitalized and dying among the vaccinated, as compared with the unvaccinated, has substantially increased. As have the deaths: during the delta wave in the United States, vaccinated individuals accounted for 23% of the deaths, whereas this nearly doubled to 42% during the omicron wave. Many of these hospitalizations and deaths among vaccinated people can be attributed to lack of a booster shot or the substantially waned effectiveness that sets in by 4 months after a booster.

Moreover, a major misconception is that the vaccines are holding steady to protect against severe disease, hospitalizations, and deaths. They are not. When a booster was given during the delta wave, it fully restored protection against these outcomes, to the level of 95% effectiveness. But for omicron, with a booster (or 2nd booster), the protection was approximately 80%. While still high, it represents a major, 4-fold (lack of effectiveness of 55% v 20%) dropdown. Accordingly, the confidence that our vaccines, directed to the original strain from 2019, are highly protective from severe illness is exaggerated. No less are the clear signs that the durability of such protection is reduced. All of this is tied to the marked evolution of the virus, and we yet lack any data on vaccine effectiveness versus the BA.2.12.1 variant, soon to be dominant here.

With the prospect of more noxious variants ahead, it is unfathomable that we now surrender. No more funding from the government. The only new vaccine in the hopper is an omicron booster, but since that is based on the BA.1 variant, it may not provide much protection against what we are seeing now (BA.2.12.1 has reduced cross-immunity) or where the virus will be come this summer, when that vaccine may become available. We even face a shortage of vaccines in the months ahead.

Rather than giving up, it is time to double down on innovations that have a high likelihood of anticipating the further evolution of the virus and facilitating the end of the pandemic. First on the list is the development of nasal vaccines that are variant-proof. A nasal spray that induces mucosal immunity would help to block transmission, for which we have minimal defense now from the hyper-transmissible omicron family of variants. Three such nasal vaccines are in late-stage clinical trials, but unlike the shots, there has not been any Operation Warp Speed or governmental support to expedite their execution or success. Next, with so many candidate drugs that have promise, is to speed these clinical trials. Recall that Paxlovid is the most rapid small molecule (pill) program in history: less than 2 years from design of the molecule to the completion of definitive randomized trials showing high efficacy and its commercialization. Why hasn't such aggressive pursuit been applied to so many other antivirals, which include pills, inhaled nanobodies, and ACE-2 decoys?

The concept of a pan-β-coronavirus or pan-sarbecovirus vaccine is alluring and has been pursued by academic labs throughout the world over the past 2 years. Tens of broad neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have been discovered, which have high likelihood of protecting against any future variant. But there is nearly a void of developing and testing a vaccine based on these bnAbs. Such vaccines are clearly in our reach, but the lack of investment in a high priority and velocity initiative is holding us back. A combination of nasal or oral vaccines, more and better drugs, and a variant-proof coronavirus vaccine would likely catalyze a definitive pandemic exit.

The public perception that our vaccines are "leaky" is true, but it's off-base to assign the fault to the vaccines, which have saved millions of lives around the world. It's the virus's accelerated evolution -- that it's sneaky and has become more formidable over time -- that is at the root of our problem now. We can outsmart and finally get ahead of the virus if we don't submit to fatigue instead of rugged perseverance, and to foolishness rather than intelligence.

[3] Vaccine: youth

Two new observational studies detail Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine protection among US children and adolescents amid the omicron variant surge, one finding 71% efficacy against infection after a 3rd dose in 12-15 year olds, and the 2nd showing lower risks of infection and hospitalization in vaccinated youth aged 5-17 in New York state. The studies were published late last week in JAMA.

In the 1st study [ref 1 below], researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed data from 74 208 drive-thru polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 test results from children aged 5-11 years, and 47 744 tests from aged 12-15 from 26 Dec 2021 - 21 Feb 2022. The tests were conducted by a single pharmacy chain at 6897 sites in 49 states; Washington, DC; and Puerto Rico.

The researchers compared the effectiveness of 2 Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses at least 2 weeks before testing with no vaccination in children, and 2 or 3 doses 2 or more weeks earlier in adolescents. Overall, the study involved 30 888 positive tests and 43 209 negative tests from children aged 5-11 and 22 273 positive tests and 25 471 negative tests from 12-15 year olds. Median age was 10 years, 50.2% were girls, 70.1% were White, and 25.7% were Hispanic or Latino.

Among the younger age group, 78.4% of test results were from unvaccinated children, and 21.3% were from 2-dose recipients. In test results from those aged 12-15 years, 51.9% were from unvaccinated participants, 46.2% from 2-dose recipients, and 1.9% from those who received a 3rd dose.

Two to 4 weeks after the 2nd dose in children, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of symptomatic infection was 0.40 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35-0.45), and estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) was 60.1% [CI 54.7%-64.8%]). Among adolescents, the OR was 0.40 (CI 0.29-0.56), and estimated VE was 59.5% [CI 44.3%-70.6%]).

In the 2nd month after the 2nd dose among children, the OR was 0.71 (CI 0.67-0.76), and estimated VE was 28.9% (CI 24.5%-33.1%). Among adolescents, the OR was 0.83 (CI 0.76-0.92), and estimated VE was 16.6% (CI 8.1%-24.3%). The OR 2-6.5 weeks after the booster dose in adolescents was 0.29 (CI 0.24-0.35), and estimated VE was 71.1% (CI 65.5%-75.7%).

"Among children and adolescents, estimated VE for 2 doses of BNT162b2 [Pfizer] against symptomatic infection was modest and decreased rapidly," the authors wrote. "Among adolescents, the estimated effectiveness increased after a booster dose."

A research team from the New York State Department of Health used 4 state COVID-19 databases to evaluate infections and hospitalizations among vaccinated children aged 5-11 years (2 doses) and adolescents aged 12-17 (2 or 3 doses) who had completed the series at least 14 days earlier, and those who were unvaccinated from 29 Nov 2021-30 Jan 2022 [ref 2 below].

A total of 365 502 children 5-11 years old (mean 8.3 years) were fully vaccinated, and another 997 554 (mean 7.8 years) were unvaccinated. Among adolescents, 852 384 (mean 14.6 years) were fully vaccinated, and 208 145 (mean 14.6 years) were unvaccinated. Over the study period, 140 680 COVID-19 infections and 414 hospitalizations occurred in the younger age group, while there were 154 555 infections and 671 hospitalizations in older participants.

Among adolescents, the unvaccinated versus vaccinated incident rate ratios (IRRs) against infection fell from 6.7 (CI 6.2-7.2) on 29 Nov [2021] to 2.9 (CI 2.8-3.0) by 13 Dec [2021] and then to 2.0 (CI 1.9-2.2) by 24 Jan [2022]. Omicron made up 19% of sequences in the 1st period and greater than 99% in the later period.

Among 5-11 year olds, the IRR against infection in unvaccinated versus fully vaccinated children was 3.1 (CI 2.7-3.6) the week of 13 Dec [2021], falling to 1.1 (CI 1.1-1.2) by 24 Jan [2022]. Hospitalizations were higher in unvaccinated than in fully vaccinated participants by 24 Jan [2022], with an IRR of 1.9 (CI 0.9-4.8) in the younger age group, compared with 3.7 (CI 2.1-6.5) in the older age group.

Within 13 or fewer days of full vaccination, the IRR for infection for unvaccinated versus vaccinated 5-11 year olds was 2.9 (CI 2.7-3.1) and was 2.3 (CI 1.9-2.7) and 1.1 (CI 1.1-1.2) at 28-34 days. At the same time points, the IRRs among 12-17 year olds were 4.3 (CI 1.1-1.2) and 2.3 (CI 1.9-2.7) at 28-34 days.

The risks of infection and hospitalization were higher for unvaccinated than vaccinated participants in both age groups, although the risk declined as omicron circulated more widely. Protection declined over time since vaccination. "These results complement recent findings of reduced vaccine effectiveness for adolescents against the delta variant and the dual effects of the variant and waning protection against infection, with sustained protection against hospitalizations," the researchers wrote. "These findings support efforts to increase vaccination coverage in children and adolescents and review dosing strategies for children aged 5-11 years."

In a commentary on both studies [ref 3 below], Sophie Katz and Kathryn Edwards of Vanderbilt University, asked whether the appropriate doses of COVID-19 for children have been chosen.

"During the pivotal clinical trials submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the EUA [emergency use authorization], the immune responses observed in adolescents at the 30-µg [microgram] dose were nearly 2-fold higher than the immune responses observed in adults 16-32 years of age," they wrote. "Receipt of the 10-µg dose in children 5-11 years old was comparable to the immune responses in adults, but less than the immune responses to the 30-µg dose for adolescents."

But Katz and Edwards pointed out that while children can have severe COVID-19 infections, they generally are milder than in adults, and a previous study [ref 4 below] published on a preprint server suggested that 75% of US children have already been infected. "An acceptable balance between safety and effectiveness of pediatric vaccines is paramount, particularly because many children will likely have preexisting natural immunity," they wrote.

"The encouraging message should be that although vaccine protection for children and adolescents was lower in the omicron era than with previous variants and that such protection wanes rapidly, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization remains high and booster doses confer additional protection," they concluded.

[4] US deaths
Date: Fri 13 May 2022

Among wealthy countries, the United States has been notably unsuccessful at persuading residents to get fully vaccinated and boosted. Today [13 May 2022], about a third of people across the US have not been fully vaccinated, and some 70% of the population has not received a booster. (By contrast, 17% of people in Canada have not been fully vaccinated, and 46% have not had boosters.)

Nearly half of the deaths from COVID in the US occurred after vaccines were made widely available. The failure to vaccinate, epidemiologists say, contributed to hundreds of thousands of deaths. During the omicron wave in December 2021 and January 2022, for instance, the COVID death rate in the US was higher than in Germany, France, Britain, or Canada, which had each fully vaccinated and boosted larger shares of their populations.

Older people tend to have weaker organ function and immune systems, leaving them more vulnerable to disease and less likely to respond to vaccines. Indeed, age has sometimes been a bigger risk factor than vaccine status during the pandemic. People 80 and older who had gotten shots were almost twice as likely to die at the height of the omicron wave as those in their 50s or early 60s who had not, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

But public health experts said the reluctance of others to adapt their behavior was a contributing factor to the large number of deaths among older people over the course of the pandemic. Lower incomes also correlate with a lower likelihood of vaccination, which is in turn associated with COVID deaths. For example, while Republicans have been far more likely to go unvaccinated than Democrats, a divide also exists between high-earning Republicans and poorer ones. ...there is little doubt that America fared worse than almost all wealthy nations, with one of the highest rates of infection, according to an analysis in The Lancet.

[In the past 24 hours, 10 countries -- the USA (126 778), Australia (68 391), Taiwan (61 714), the UK (43 994), South Korea (35 072), Japan (34 845), Argentina (33 989), Germany (29 394), Brazil (13 510), and Italy (13 776) -- all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 2125 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 14 May 2022 to late 15 May 2022).

A total of 27 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 13 of the 27 countries are from the European region, 5 are from the Americas region, 0 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, and 1 is from the African region.
