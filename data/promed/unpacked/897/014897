[1] Long COVID
Date: Sun 13 Jun 2021

In June 2020, as the first reports of long COVID began to filter through the medical community, doctors attempting to grapple with this mysterious malaise began to notice an unusual trend. While acute cases of COVID-19 - particularly those hospitalised with the disease - tended to be mostly male and over 50, long COVID sufferers were, by contrast, both relatively young and overwhelmingly female.

Early reports of long COVID at a Paris hospital between May and July 2020 suggested that the average age was around 40, and women afflicted by the longer-term effects of COVID-19 outnumbered men by 4:1. [Rubin R. As Their Numbers Grow, COVID-19 "Long Haulers" Stump Experts. JAMA. 2020;324(14):1381-1383. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.17709]

Over the past 12 months, a similar gender skew has become apparent around the world. From long COVID patients monitored by hospitals in Bangladesh and Russia to the COVID Symptom Tracker app, [https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/COVID-long-haulers-are-often-women-maybe-it-ll-change-ncna1259686] from the UK-wide Phosp-COVID study [Torjesen I. COVID-19: Middle aged women face greater risk of debilitating long term symptoms BMJ 2021; 372 :n829 doi:10.1136/bmj.n829] assessing the longer-term impact of COVID-19, to the medical notes of specialist post-COVID care clinics across both the US and the UK, a picture has steadily emerged of young to middle-aged women being disproportionately vulnerable.

Dr. Sarah Jolley, who runs the UCHealth post-COVID care clinic in Aurora, Colorado, told the Observer that about 60% of her patients have been women. In Sweden, Karolinska Institute researcher Dr. Petter Brodin, who leads the long COVID arm of the COVID Human Genetic Effort global consortium, suspects that the overall proportion of female long COVID patients may be even higher, potentially 70-80%.

"This pattern has been seen in other post-infectious syndromes," says Dr. Melissa Heightman, who runs the UCLH post-COVID care clinic in north London. "Around 66% of our patients have been women. A lot of them were in full-time jobs, have young children, and now more than a quarter of them are completely unable to work because they're so unwell. Economically, it's a bit of a catastrophe."

As Heightman points out, this is not a new trend when it comes to infectious diseases, rather one which has historically been neglected. Women are known to be up to 4 times more likely to get ME/CFS (myalgic encephalomyelitis, or chronic fatigue syndrome), a condition believed to have infectious origins in the majority of cases, while studies have also shown that patients with chronic Lyme disease are significantly more likely to be female.

But despite this, there have been relatively few attempts to drill down into why this is the case. Instead, because these conditions predominantly affect women, they have more often been dismissed as being psychological in origin. Over the years, both ME/CFS and chronic Lyme disease have been ridiculed by sectors of the medical community as forms of hypochondria.

"In general, there's not as much research money and attention on conditions that primarily affect women," says Julie Nusbaum, an assistant professor at NYU [Langone] School of Medicine. "That's just a general disparity in medical research. I think certain biases persist that when women present with a lot of body aches or pains, there's more often an emotional or personality component to it than medical origin."

Worryingly, signs of these age-old biases have crept in over the past year with long COVID. There are anecdotal reports of female patients complaining that their persistent symptoms have been dismissed or attributed to anxiety. Dr. Janet Scott, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Glasgow, says that there remains a school of thought within the academic community that the long COVID gender skew may simply be an artefact of women being more likely to report symptoms than men.

"I don't buy it myself," says Scott. "I think it plays into the narrative of, 'Don't worry about long COVID, it's just a bunch of hysterical, middle-aged women.'"

But Scott and other scientists around the world are trying to delve into the different factors which make women more prone to developing long COVID. Understanding them could be crucial to shedding a light on this mysterious condition in general, as well as other illnesses which can be triggered by an infection.

The Pregnancy Compensation Hypothesis
-------------------------------------
At Yale School of Medicine, Connecticut, immunologist Prof Akiko Iwasaki has spent much of the past year trying to tease apart the differences between how men and women respond to the Sars-CoV-2 virus. One of her early findings was that T cells - a group of cells important to the immune system which seek out and destroy virus-infected cells - are much more active in women than men in the early stages of infection. One component of this is thought to be due to genetics.

"Women have 2 copies of the X chromosome," says Iwasaki. "And many of the genes that code for various parts of the immune system are located on that chromosome, which means different immune responses are expressed more strongly in women."

But it is also linked to a theory called the pregnancy compensation hypothesis, which suggests that women of reproductive age have more reactive immune responses to the presence of a pathogen, because their immune systems have evolved to support the heightened need for protection during pregnancy.

This robust immune response is thought to be one of the reasons why women are much less likely to die from COVID-19 during the acute phase of the infection - but it comes with a catch. One of the major theories for long COVID is that fragments of the virus manage to linger in remote pockets of the body, known as reservoirs, for many months. Iwasaki says that remnants of Sars-CoV-2 have been discovered in almost every tissue from the brain to the kidneys.

Because women react so strongly to the presence of a virus, some scientists think that these viral reservoirs are more likely to trigger waves of chronic inflammation throughout the body, leading to the symptoms of pain, fatigue and brain fog experienced by many with long COVID.

Evidence to support this idea has been found in studies of chronic Lyme disease. The bacterium _Borrelia burgdorferi_, which causes Lyme disease, is also capable of burrowing into tissue and nerves and hiding out in the body, leading to chronic symptoms. Research has shown that women have a more intense response to the presence of _B burgdorferi_, producing much higher levels of inflammatory cytokines - small proteins - than men.

"There's increasing evidence that women respond more to this kind of persistent, low-grade infection than men," says Dr. Raphael Stricker, a Lyme disease researcher based in San Francisco. "And so they're much more likely to have chronic inflammation."

Autoimmune disease
------------------
This is unlikely to be the sole explanation, however. Many scientists studying long COVID believe that, in a proportion of cases, the virus may have triggered an autoimmune disease, causing elements of the immune system to produce self-directed antibodies known as autoantibodies, which attack the body's own organs. Since December last year [2020], Iwasaki and others [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00149-1] have published studies that have identified elevated levels of more than 100 different autoantibodies in COVID-19 patients, directed against a range of tissues from the lining of blood vessels to the brain. While the level of some of these autoantibodies subsided naturally over time, others lingered. Iwasaki believes that if these self-directed antibodies remain in the blood of long COVID patients over the course of many months, it could explain many of the common symptoms, from cognitive dysfunction to clots, and dysautonomia - a condition where patients experience an uncomfortable and rapid increase in heartbeat when attempting any kind of activity.

There have previously been indications of this in studies of ME/CFS [https://www.meresearch.org.uk/sex-differences-in-mecfs/]. Female patients have been found to be far more likely to experience autoimmune-related ailments, ranging from new allergies to muscle stiffness and joint pain, a similar symptom profile to many of those with long COVID.

Iwasaki is now conducting another study looking to examine whether certain autoantibodies are present in particularly high levels in female long COVID patients. If this proves to be the case, it would not come as a complete surprise. Viruses have long been linked to the onset of autoimmune diseases ranging from type 1 diabetes to rheumatoid arthritis, and all of these conditions are far more prevalent in women, with surveys finding that women comprise 78% of autoimmune disease cases in the US.

"Viral infections prompt the immune system to respond," says Nusbaum at NYU. "And for many women, particularly if they're genetically predisposed, that immune response can be so robust that you enter into this kind of dysregulated immunity, which doesn't get turned off even after the virus is cleared."

Women are more prone to autoimmune problems for a number of reasons, ranging from a molecular switch called VGLL3, which women have in far higher levels than men and which can tip the immune system into overdrive, to the sex hormone estrogen, which can increase inflammation. Men on the other hand are more protected against developing autoimmune-related problems due to their higher levels of testosterone, which suppress the number of autoantibody-producing cells called B cells. Iwasaki believes that this tendency may well be the major factor that explains the long COVID gender skew.

"In the case of long COVID, the virus may tip the balance towards autoimmunity in people who already have that tendency to begin with," she says.

Some scientists have already begun to describe long COVID as an estrogen-associated autoimmune disease, calling for more research dedicated to identifying both personalised and gender-specific long COVID treatments. [Ortona, E., Buonsenso, D., Carfi, A. et al. Long COVID: an estrogen-associated autoimmune disease?. Cell Death Discov. 7, 77 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-021-00464-6]

If autoantibodies are consistently found in particularly high levels in female long COVID patients, one approach could be to treat them with immunosuppressive medications, such as steroids.

"We need to try and identify the underlying causes in each case," says Iwasaki. "That could be one approach, while in other cases where the problem is a persistent COVID-19 infection, you might want to treat those patients with antivirals. We'll continue to get more information on this over the next few months."

Many hope that the answers gleaned from understanding the long COVID gender skew could also help provide more insights into treating other conditions that are particularly prevalent in women, such as ME/CFS, and even certain autoimmune illnesses.

"A lot of the symptoms being experienced by the COVID long haulers are very similar to chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia and some of these other chronic conditions that we don't fully understand," says Nusbaum. "I do think it's possible that the attention now being placed on long COVID could help provide an insight into that, which would be a very welcome benefit."

["Hormonal therapies may prove useful against COVID-19, given the varied impact of the male and female endocrine axis on immune health. Estrogen and progesterone stimulate the immune system, with progesterone having anti-inflammatory properties. Opposingly, testosterone suppresses the immune response. Given the sex gap in COVID-19 mortality rates, the immune-modulatory effects of estrogen and progesterone are now being studied as potential therapeutics even for male patients."

[2] Russia: surge
Date: Sat 12 Jun 2021

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/12/world/russia-covid-surge.html?searchResultPosition=1


Russian officials scrambled on [Sat 12 Jun 2021] to slow the spread of a new wave of the coronavirus, ordering workers in Moscow to take next week off and pleading with the populace to make use of widely available vaccines.

The biggest spike appeared to be in Moscow, the Russian capital, which reported 6701 new cases on [Sat 12 Jun 2021] -- more than double the rise 5 days ago, and the highest single-day total since December [2020]. Mayor Sergey S. Sobyanin said the situation had "sharply worsened" in the past week, and that thousands of hospital beds were being repurposed to provide care for COVID-19 patients.

"According to epidemiologists, it is now necessary to at least slow down the speed of, if not stop, the spread of the virus," Mr. Sobyanin said on his blog. Bars and restaurants will be required to stop serving customers at 11 p.m., food courts in shopping malls will be closed, and public playgrounds and athletic grounds will be closed, Mr. Sobyanin said. Most employers will be required to keep workers home -- with pay -- next week. However, Mr. Sobyanin did not impose new restrictions on indoor dining beyond the 11 p.m. cutoff, reflecting the Kremlin's prioritization of the economy in its policies during the pandemic.

Overall, Russia reported 13 510 new cases on [Sat 12 Jun 2021], the highest number since February [2021] and a 50% rise from a week earlier. Just as worrying to epidemiologists is that Russia's vaccination campaign appears to be stalling. President Vladimir V. Putin said on [Sat 12 Jun 2021] that 18 million people had been vaccinated in the country, which is less than 13% of the population, even though Russia's Sputnik V shots have been widely available for months.

"Right now, we can vaccinate everyone in Russia given the volume of vaccine being produced," Mr. Putin said at an annual state awards ceremony at the Kremlin on Sat, according to Interfax. "The question is that, as always -- it's a typical phenomenon here -- people are cautious about all such procedures."

The 2-dose Sputnik V vaccine is 91.6% effective against the coronavirus, according to peer-reviewed research published in The Lancet in January [2021] [Loqwesgunov DY, Dolzhikova IV, Shcheblyakov DV et al. Safety and efficacy of an rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine: an interim analysis of a randomised controlled phase 3 trial in Russia. Lancet:397 (10275):671-681, 2021. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00234-8].

But polls show that nearly 2-thirds of Russians say they do not plan to get the vaccine. Analysts attribute Russians' hesitancy to a seemingly contradictory mix of factors: widespread distrust of the authorities on the one hand, and frequent state television reports describing the coronavirus as mostly defeated or not very dangerous on the other.

Russian officials frequently claim that the country has handled the coronavirus better than the West. There have been no large-scale lockdowns in the country since last summer [2020]. The official death toll stands at 126 073, but the unusually high number of deaths in the past year suggests that the real toll is several times higher.

Now, with Western countries emerging from lockdowns, Russia runs the risk of entering a vicious new wave of the virus. And officials are starting to acknowledge that the pandemic will not end in the country anytime soon unless the vaccination rate accelerates drastically.

"Until we have truly mass vaccination, the city will constantly be getting sick," Mr. Sobyanin said on [Sat 12 Jun 2021].

Date: Sat 12 Jun 2021

https://amp.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3137083/coronavirus-guangzhou-patients-thought-they-had-flu-delayed?__twitter_impression=true


Nearly 2-thirds of the COVID-19 patients diagnosed in an outbreak in a southern Chinese city thought they had the flu and delayed seeking treatment, public health officials said on [Sat 12 Jun 2021] amid signs of easing in the disease's spread.

Yang Zhibin, director of the centre for disease control and prevention in Guangzhou, said nearly 60% of the latest patients confirmed with COVID-19 self-medicated with flu drugs after experiencing symptoms including fever, coughing, fatigue, a sore throat and a poor sense of smell.

The city reported just 8 new cases of the coronavirus, taking its total in this outbreak to 136. Of those, 129 were confirmed cases and seven were asymptomatic.

Chen Bin, deputy chief of Guangzhou's health commission, said all of the 8 new cases were identified during screening of residents quarantined in a hotel.

Chen said 7 of the cases were residents from the Baihedong area in Liwan district and the other lived in Nanshan district's Zhujiang Street community. Close contacts of the patients had also been quarantined, he said.

The outbreak began on [Fri 21 May 2021] and has been dominated by the Delta strain of the coronavirus.

All the cases can be traced to a 75-year-old woman in Liwan district. The woman did not have a history of travel outside Guangzhou but was infected by the highly transmissible strain first detected in India. She was discharged from hospital on [Thu 10 Jun 2021].

The city then embarked on a programme of mass testing, carrying out more than 32 million tests in an area with a population of 18 million people. A further 10 million tests were carried out in the neighbouring city of Foshan to detect asymptomatic carriers. Guangzhou's Tianhe Stadium was converted into a massive temporary testing centre, performing 1.5 million tests a day.

On [Sat 12 Jun 2021], police in Guangzhou's Nansha district said they were formally investigating a couple accused of hiding their visits to high-risk areas, China News Service reported.

The couple lived in the Zhujiang Street area and ate at a Liwan district restaurant on [Fri 25 May 2021]. They sought hospital treatment on [Thu 3 Jun 2021], tested positive on [Sat 5 Jun 2021] and were accused of hindering disease prevention and control efforts by failing to detail their movements in a hospital questionnaire.

Provincial health authorities said the 8 cases in Guangzhou were the only local ones reported in Guangdong on [Sat 12 Jun 2021] - no recent new cases were found in Maoming, Foshan or Shenzhen.

Meanwhile, the province confirmed 2 more imported cases on [Sat 12 Jun 2021] - one was a passenger from Nepal who arrived in Guangzhou and the other was a person from South Africa who travelled to Shenzhen.

In addition, there were 2 imported asymptomatic cases - one was a person in Guangzhou who travelled from Cambodia and another travelled from the United Arab Emirates to Zhongshan.

As of Sat, Guangdong province had a total of 2605 cases, of which 1065 were imported and 182 are still in hospital.

[Here again is a good illustration of how rapid tests could help prevent spread of virus. These individuals who thought they had flu could easily have self-tested had rapid home tests been available, and then determined they needed to quarantine. The early symptoms of both flu and COVID and many other diseases are non-specific and not diagnostic without an assay. - Mod. LK]

[4] Severe COVID: T cell cytotoxicity

Summary
-------
Severe COVID-19 is linked to both dysfunctional immune response and unrestrained immunopathogenesis, and it remains unclear if T cells also contribute to disease pathology. Here, we combined single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics with mechanistic studies to assess pathogenic T cell functions and inducing signals. We identified highly activated, CD16+ T cells with increased cytotoxic functions in severe COVID-19. CD16 expression enabled immune complex-mediated, T cell receptor-independent degranulation and cytotoxicity not found in other diseases. CD16+ T cells from COVID-19 patients promoted microvascular endothelial cell injury and release of neutrophil and monocyte chemoattractants. CD16+ T cell clones persisted beyond acute disease maintaining their cytotoxic phenotype. Age-dependent generation of C3a in severe COVID-19 induced activated CD16+ cytotoxic T cells. The proportion of activated CD16+ T cells and plasma levels of complement proteins upstream of C3a correlated with clinical outcome of COVID-19, supporting a pathological role of exacerbated cytotoxicity and complement activation in COVID-19.

Discussion
----------
Taken together, particularly severe COVID-19 leads to an elevation of activated CD16+ T cells that link the elevated complement cascade via TCR-independent cytotoxic T cell functionality to endothelial damage and patient survival, thereby establishing a novel immunopathological link between the innate immune system, the adaptive immune compartment, and endothelial injury, which might constitute an important molecular axis explaining the vast spectrum of organ damage observed in COVID-19.
