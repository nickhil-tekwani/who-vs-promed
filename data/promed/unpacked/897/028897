The Role of Norwalk-like Virus in Outbreaks of Nosocomial Gastroenteritis
---------------------------------------------------
Norwalk-like virus is now commonly isolated from outbreaks in chronic care
facilities and nursing homes. Its role in nosocomial (hospital-acquired)
gastroenteritis is still not well established.
Therefore we investigated the role of Norwalk-like virus in outbreaks of
nosocomial gastroenteritis. Of 12 nosocomial outbreaks we investigated, 7
were caused by Norwalk-like virus; 1 by rotavirus; 1 by _Salmonella
enteritidis_; and the causation of 3 was unclear.
An estimated 515 [cases were [involved. Kitchen workers were concerned
in 4 (58%) of the 7 Norwalk-like virus outbreaks. All the Norwalk-like
virus outbreaks [conformed to an epidemiologic curve of a point source
with secondary cross-infections.
Our findings suggest that Norwalk-like virus is the most frequently
isolated pathogen in nosocomial outbreaks of gastroenteritis. Most cases
seemed to be due to primary or secondary contamination of food.
Cross-infection via staff is a frequent route of secondary transmission.
Establishment of routine viral diagnosis in implicated foods and water is
necessary to confirm the data. Until routine diagnosis of Norwalk-like
virus in foods and water becomes standard procedure, outbreak
investigations have to focus on stool diagnosis of patients and food
handlers/kitchen workers in addition to standard epidemiological [approaches.
