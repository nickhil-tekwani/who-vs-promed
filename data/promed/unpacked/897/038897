Parents are very sad due to the sudden death of 3 siblings in Morena [Madhya Pradesh]. One after the other, the health of all the 3 children suddenly worsened, fever came, then tremors started coming, and soon all 3 children fell asleep. The villagers are being told that 3 out of 5 children of a resident of Bhilsainya village of Kailaras development block of Morena district, have died. A few days back, a 3-year-old [girl] had a fever. After this, she started having tremors, was given medicine, and also got exorcised [she was admitted to hospital and died during treatment]. Meanwhile, on 19 Dec 2022, her 6-year-old [sister] also started having tremors; she died during treatment in the hospital. After this, their 17-month-old brother fell ill 2 days ago and died in front of his parents.

Relatives say that when the 3-year-old girl fell ill, she was having tremors. Her elder sister had swelling in her head and was having tremors. She was admitted in Gwalior [Madhya Pradesh]. After this, the 17-month-old brother died in his mother's lap.

The parents are in shock due to the loss of all 3 children. 3 out of their 5 children have died. The health of both the elder daughters is bad.

There is mourning in the village after the death of the 3 children. Everyone is reaching the family's house to console. Here the villagers are saying that even a few years back, 2-3 people had died in the same way in the village.

In this case, doctors say that all 3 children may have nervous system illness or fever. Due to this, the children were getting tremors. CMHO [Chief Medical and Health Officer], Dr Rakesh Sharma, told that it is difficult to say how the children died. In detecting disease, possible brain fever (acute encephalitis syndrome [AES]]) [is suggested].

[Acute encephalitis syndrome and Japanese encephalitis in children are not as frequently reported in Madhya Pradesh state as they are in northeastern states such as Bihar and Assam states. The report indicates that the children had CNS disease and suggests that acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) was the cause of the fatal disease. AES is not a specific etiologic diagnosis.

Dr T Jacob John offered the following comments (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (04): comment 20220425.8702831), "WHO has been promoting syndromic diagnoses for a variety of conditions, but this one, AES, has led to death due to misdiagnosis in many children. Such a diagnostic term to cover acute encephalitis (mostly viral such as JE, herpes simplex, West Nile), acute encephalopathy (mostly biochemical and non-infectious, such as hypoglycemic encephalopathy, heat hyperpyrexia, Reye syndrome), pyogenic meningitis (pneumococcal or _H. influenzae_ b, occasionally _N. meningitidis_), cerebral complications of systemic diseases (scrub typhus, leptospirosis, chikungunya), TB meningitis, viral meningitis, cerebral malaria, brain abscess, etc., is not only unscientific but also unethical as it condones lack of further investigations, even a lumbar puncture.

"When clusters of cases are reported, the disease is taken as JE without protocol-based investigations. Acute encephalopathy and scrub typhus also may occur in clusters.

"I had repeatedly condemned this shortcut diagnostic term, which I declare is not a diagnostic term at all. Each child with brain fever (translation of 'chamki buckar') deserves an etiology-specific diagnosis, and the term AES is better avoided in clinical practice.

"There are 2 useful references:

Dr John's declaration that AES, "is not a diagnostic term at all. Each child with brain fever deserves an etiology-specific diagnosis, and the term AES is better avoided in clinical practice" should be heeded. - Mod.TY]
