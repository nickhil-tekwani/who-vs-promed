In the past 15 days, the number of cases of confirmed toxoplasmosis has increased from 594 to 621, according to a new epidemic bulletin. The number of confirmed cases of toxoplasmosis in Santa Maria totals 621, according to the latest bulletin of the government of Rio Grande do Sul and the city council on the epidemic facing the region. Since 2 weeks ago [29 Jun 2018], the date of the previous report, 27 new cases have been counted. The newsletter is published every 2 weeks. Of the more than 600 confirmed cases, 54 are pregnant women, with 3 fetal deaths and 3 abortions.

The number of suspected cases increased from 1291 on [29 Jun 2018] to 1486 on Friday [13 Jul 2018]. Of these, 350 were rejected and 515 are still under investigation. The total number of cases related to the disease is 1786, according to the latest newsletter.

The causes of the epidemic, confirmed by the State Secretariat of SAR in April this year [2018], are still unknown, and the authorities continue to investigate the event, under the supervision of the federal prosecution. Last Friday [6 Jul 2018], an examination detected the presence of the protozoan responsible for the disease in the water tank of a town residence. But the relationship between the protozoan and the epidemic has not been confirmed. In the house live 2 people who have been infected and 2 others who do not have the disease.

Toxoplasmosis, popularly known as cat disease, is an infectious disease caused by a protozoan called _Toxoplasma gondii_. This protozoan is easily found in nature and can cause infection in many mammals and birds around the world.

According to the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases, the disease can occur through the ingestion of oocysts (where the parasite grows) from soil, sand, and bins contaminated with feces from infected cats; ingestion of raw and undercooked meat infected with oocysts, especially pork and mutton; or by transplacental infection, occurring in 40% of fetuses of mothers who contracted infection during pregnancy. The incubation period of toxoplasmosis ranges from 10 to 23 days when the cause is meat consumption, and from 5 to 20 days when the reason is contact with cat feces oocysts.

The Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases suggests some preventive measures. Do not eat raw or malnourished meats, and eat only well-washed vegetables and fruits cleaned with running water. Avoid contact with cat feces. In addition to avoiding contact with cats, pregnant women must undergo appropriate medical (prenatal) monitoring. Some countries have prevented intrauterine contamination by performing laboratory tests in all pregnant women. In immunocompromised individuals, prevention may be necessary with the use of drugs based on an individual analysis of each case.

[The first report of the outbreak in ProMED is from the 27 April 2018, when the number of suspected cases was 199. At that time, we pointed out that the diagnostic criteria were not described, but toxoplasmosis is well known in Brazil and we assume that the diagnosis is correct.

An outbreak of this size can only be waterborne, and waterborne outbreaks are well known in Brazil [de Moura L, et al. Waterborne toxoplasmosis, Brazil, from field to gene. Emerg Infect Dis 2006;12:326-329]. Surface water is most certainly infected, but an outbreak of this size over an extended period points to contamination of the city's water sources, most probably surface reservoirs that can be contaminated by felines that defecate in the reservoir. This happened in Vancouver [Bowie WR, et al. Outbreak of toxoplasmosis associated with municipal drinking water. The BC Toxoplasma Investigation Team. Lancet 1997;350:173-177] when a water reservoir was contaminated by cougars [Aramini JJ, et al. _Toxoplasma gondii_ in Vancouver Island cougars (_Felis concolor vancouverensis_): serology and oocyst shedding. J Parasitol 1998;84:438-440].

It is correct as pointed out in the text that _T. gondii_ is also transmitted by infected meat if eaten raw or undercooked, but it is unlikely that meat could infect so many people over such a long period. The best advice to the people of Santa Maria would be to boil water used for consumption before use. - Mod.EP
