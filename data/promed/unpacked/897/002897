The European ban on British cows has left many farmers in financial
difficulties. Harry Goode admits his idea to make ends meet is a bit
of a gimmick. He is selling advertising space on his cows, which graze
near the Birmingham motorway. Goode has already sold eight ads,
charging 300 pounds (US$450) per week for the cow placards. "They are
losing money while they are feeding so they might as well start paying
for their upkeep."
