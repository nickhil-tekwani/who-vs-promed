The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has announced 2 new but unrelated

The 1st case is a 2-year-old male from Depok City, West Java
Province. He developed symptoms on 3 Feb 2011, was admitted to a
private clinic on 5 Feb 2011, and was referred to a hospital on 6 Feb
2011. He died on 6 Feb 2011. Prior to his illness, sick and dead
poultry were reported in his neighborhood [previously reported by

The 2nd case is a 31-year-old female from Bekasi City, West Java
Province. She developed symptoms on 23 Feb 2011, was admitted to a
private clinic on 25 Feb 2011, and was referred to a hospital on 28
Feb 2011, where she received oseltamivir treatment. She died on 1 Mar
2011. Initial investigations indicate the case visited a traditional
market where live poultry were sold [previously reported by
