Thai Binh province has recorded nearly 18 000ha [44 500 acres] of black-striped streaky rice. Heavy infections and loss of about 2400ha [5900 acres] were concentrated in 4 districts.

Since the end of July [2017], the phenomenon of dwarf rice has appeared scattered in many fields. When the black dwarf was discovered, the area of infected rice was very large. At present, the treatment of eradication and destruction of severely damaged rice is a big problem for farmers.

[In July 2017,] Nghe An [province] announced an epidemic of black dwarf rice disease.

[The report above refers to black streaked dwarf disease (BSDD) of rice. BSDD due to _Rice black streaked dwarf virus_ (RBSDV; genus _Fijivirus_) is known to cause serious crop losses in South East Asia. Symptoms include darkening and distortion of leaves, black streaked tumours along leaf veins, as well as severe stunting of plants. RBSDV also affects some other gramineous hosts including maize, wheat, oat and barley. It is spread by planthoppers including _Laodelphax striatellus_ and _Unkanodes_ species.

However, in 2009, the spread of a new virus associated with BSDD symptoms, but transmitted by the white backed planthopper (WBPH, _Sogatella furcifera_) which is not a vector of RBSDV, was reported from southern China and northern Viet Nam (where the provinces in the report above are situated). The new virus was named _Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus_ (SRBSDV) and also assigned to genus _Fijivirus_. RBSDV and the closely related _Maize rough dwarf virus_ (MRDV) have both been classed into the serogroup 2 of the genus, and SRBSDV appears to belong to the same group.

Disease management for rice viruses includes cultural practices, vector control and use of cultivars with resistance to the virus, the vector, or both. However, since genetic traits for resistance against the new SRBSDV have not yet been analysed, insecticide sprays against the vector are currently the only available avenue. The new SRBSDV and an increase in WBPH numbers are a major concern in the region where the crop is already frequently affected by other diseases including several viruses (for example, ragged and grassy stunt, see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).
