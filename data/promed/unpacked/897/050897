Romania has identified an outbreak of bird flu at a poultry farm
close to Ukraine and enforced a 20 km [12.5 mi]-wide surveillance
zone around it, the European Union's executive said on Tuesday [16 Mar 2010].

The outbreak of the H5N1 virus in the commune of Letea near the
Ukrainian border is the first detected in Europe since it was found
in a wild duck in Germany a year ago [2009].

"Romania's national laboratory confirmed yesterday [15 Mar 2010] that
the outbreak concerns the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian
influenza," the European Commission said in a statement.

"In order to limit the spread of the virus, the Romanian authorities
applied immediately the necessary control measures laid down in EU
legislation," it added. All birds in the farm will have to be
slaughtered, a 6 km [4 mi]-wide protection zone will have to be
enforced around it, surrounded by a 20 km-wide "high risk"
surveillance zone with strict movement controls.

"Gatherings of poultry and other birds are banned, and on-farm
bio-security measures must be strengthened," said the Commission.

[Similarly to the initial H5N1 outbreak in Romania, in 2005-06, this
outbreak, in Letea (Letti) is situated in the East Romanian Tulcea
County, within the Danube Delta, adjacent to the Ukrainian border.
The Delta is characterised by the plentiful avian population in an
expanse of wetlands and a flyway for migrating birds; see map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RO/00/Letea.html>.

The last HPAI H5N1 outbreak in Romania was reported in
November-December 2007, similarly in the Tulcea county; see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6525>.

Later, in February 2009, an outbreak of a low-pathogenicity avian
Influenza (H5N3) was recorded in the same region, affecting domestic
ducks and geese, which had been introduced as sentinel birds in the
Danube Delta to be in contact with wildlife; see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7803>.
