Texas poultry and game bird owners urged to check flocks
----------------------------------
Texas animal health officials are urging poultry, fowl, and game bird
owners to check their flocks and report signs of illness among birds after
exotic Newcastle disease (END), a highly contagious virus among birds, was
confirmed on 1 Oct near Los Angeles, California. While END poses no threat
to human health, some strains of the virus can kill nearly 100 per cent of
affected birds.
"California's disease investigation was initiated in late September after
nearly 200 game birds died on a premise near Los Angeles," said Dr Max
Coats, assistant deputy director for Animal Health Programs at the Texas
Animal Health Commission (TAHC), the state's livestock health regulatory
agency. "The National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa,
has completed tests on samples collected from the birds and confirmed the
Exotic Newcastle Disease (END) diagnosis. As of 3 October, 6 California
premises are involved in the poultry disease situation, and infected flocks
are being depopulated to prevent spread of END. Fortunately, none of the
affected premises are near commercial poultry operations, and regulatory
veterinarians from California and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)
say there is no indication of additional infected farms."
Dr Coats pointed out that a wide variety of pet and wild birds can carry
END. He urged flock owners to check birds and report signs of illness to
the TAHC at 1-800-550-8242. TAHC or USDA veterinarians can work with
private practitioners at no charge to collect samples for testing.
Signs to watch for include:
- birds that gasp and cough
- birds that exhibit central nervous system disorders, such as circling,
depression, paralysis, drooping wings, or dragging legs
- birds that produce fewer eggs
- birds with greenish diarrhea
- birds that develop swelling of tissues around the eyes and neck
- unusually high death losses in the flock
Dr Coats said laboratory testing is needed to confirm a clinical diagnosis
of the Newcastle Disease, as signs can also mimic those of other poultry
diseases. In Texas, tests can be run by staff in the poultry diagnostic
laboratories in Center and Gonzales. These are part of the Texas Veterinary
Medical Diagnostic Laboratory system, headquartered in College Station.
Carrier birds can spread the virus through respiratory discharges or feces.
Caretakers can also become mechanical carriers of the disease, as the virus
can be picked up and carried on shoes and clothing, feed trucks, or
equipment. In warm, humid weather, the virus can survive several weeks; in
cold temperatures, it can remain alive indefinitely. Viral disinfectants,
dry weather and sunlight kill the virus. "This is a good time to step up
biosecurity practices on farms and ranches. Routine measures should include
disinfecting footwear prior to entering or leaving a poultry facility,
wearing disposable coveralls, or at least putting on clean clothes prior to
entering a poultry site," said Dicky Richardson, a TAHC animal health
programs specialist who works with poultry disease.
"We require our staff also to wear disposable hair covers and gloves as
added protection against disease transmission. Producers should consider
disinfecting tires on vehicles, bagging dirty clothing prior to leaving a
premise, and monitoring visitors, including feed providers, service
personnel and poultry buyers to ensure they are following disinfecting
procedures. Anyone in contact with backyard poultry or game bird flocks
should shower and change their clothes before coming into contact with
commercial poultry."
Richardson said producers who visit a feed store, a neighbor's farm, coffee
shop, or grocery store should change their clothes and disinfect footwear
before returning to their poultry houses. "It's just too easy to get
clothing or footwear contaminated with a disease-causing virus and then
carry it home," he said.
"If END is introduced into an area, it is critically important to address
the outbreak immediately with depopulation of infected flocks, strict
quarantines in affected areas and surveillance in neighboring areas," said
Dr Coats. He said an outbreak in southern California in 1971 resulted in
the depopulation of nearly 12 million birds on 1341 farms. That outbreak,
which cost taxpayers $56 million, took 3 years to eradicate, and disrupted
poultry production and trade, and impacted prices of poultry products. "By
reporting signs of disease immediately, the effects of outbreaks can be
minimized," said Dr Coats. "We depend on the partnership of producers,
veterinary practitioners, the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic
Laboratory, and the public to keep livestock and poultry free of disease
and to maintain our trading opportunities."

[Clearly the outbreak in California is serious and it is likely other
states will take the same stance of warning to their producers as Texas
has. Education regarding clinical signs and the seriousness of the
situation are certainly appropriate. With increased awareness, it is hoped
the disease can be contained more quickly.
According to the USDA: "Exotic Newcastle disease is a contagious and fatal
viral disease affecting all species of birds. Previously known as velogenic
viscerotropic Newcastle disease (VVND), exotic Newcastle is probably one of
the most infectious diseases of poultry in the world. Exotic Newcastle is
so virulent that many birds die without showing any clinical signs. A death
rate of almost 100 per cent can occur in unvaccinated poultry flocks.
Exotic Newcastle can infect and cause death even in vaccinated poultry.
An outbreak of exotic Newcastle today would affect the US poultry industry
severely. In 1971, a major outbreak occurred in commercial poultry flocks
in southern California. The disease threatened not only the California
poultry industry but the entire US poultry and egg supply. In all, 1341
infected flocks were identified, and almost 12 million birds were
destroyed. Eradication efforts cost taxpayers $56 million, severely
disrupted the operations of many producers, and increased the prices of
poultry and poultry products to consumers. Exotic Newcastle has not
infected commercial chicken flocks in the United States since that outbreak
was eradicated in 1974." (From the website:
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/oa/pubs/fsend.html)>.
Newcastle disease virus can produce a transitory conjunctivitis in man, but
the condition has been limited primarily to laboratory workers and
vaccination teams exposed to large quantities of virus and before
vaccination was widely given to crews eviscerating poultry in processing
plants. The diseases has not ben reported in people who care for poultry or
consume poultry products. - Mod.TG]
