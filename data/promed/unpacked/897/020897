An attending veterinarian has confirmed a horse with respiratory equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) at a Montgomery County, Maryland boarding facility. An additional 60 horses have been exposed, and all are now under a voluntary quarantine, according to a 5 Mar 2020 Equine Disease Communication Center report.

South Dakota Animal Industry Board officials have confirmed that one Jerauld County mare tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1). Four of 10 unvaccinated mares, including the mare that tested positive, aborted their foals.

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and equine herpesvirus myeloencephalitis (EHM, the neurologic form).

In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with EHM usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help prevent disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

[Since current EHV-1 vaccines may help reduce viral shedding, please vaccinate your horse.

This disease is very difficult for the animal and the owner. While some horses recover, some become so profoundly affected they are euthanized. We really do need a vaccine for this form of the disease. - Mod.TG
