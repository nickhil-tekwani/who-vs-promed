A pink eye disease [conjunctivitis] outbreak has prompted throngs of worried families to crowd a Hanoi hospital over the last week.

Doctor Nguyen Hoang Cuong from the National Ophthalmology Hospital in Hanoi said on Monday [6 Aug 2012] that the outbreak was spreading. The hospital was crowded with people waiting for pink eye examinations that day, and doctors said it had been that way for at least a week.

A local Hanoian woman said she took her sick 8-year-old son to the hospital early in the morning, but he had to wait until noon to see a doctor. A 26-year-old factory worker from nearby Hai Duong Province said his colleagues began to get itchy and watery eyes 3 days ago and that the symptoms soon spread throughout the company, forcing many workers to take days off. Doctor Cuong said the hospital has received more than 100 people for pink eye examinations every day, around 10 percent of all outpatients.

He said the viral disease always peaked in the humid climate of August, but that the problem would probably linger after that. Many people have treated themselves at home with eye drops that actually only make things worse. "We have received patients who treated themselves with eye drops with corticoid, which, when not used at the right phase, can reduce immunity and worsen the condition, leading to cornea damage, weaker eye sight, or even vision loss," Cuong said. He said the virus can spread via a sick person's saliva.

[Conjunctivitis (pink eye) can result from many causes. These causes include viruses, bacteria, allergens, contact lens use (especially the extended-wear type), chemicals, fungi, and certain diseases. The cause of the current outbreak in the Hanoi region of Viet Nam has not been determined, but the disease is being treated as a viral infection. Many viruses can cause viral conjunctivitis, adenoviruses of different serotypes are perhaps the most common. Consequently, there is no specific therapy, other than alleviation of the symptoms. Conjunctivitis is often associated with climatic event such as sandstorms and high humidity.

Investigation of an outbreak of conjunctivitis in Hanoi in 2003 established that the predominant pathogen at that time was human adenovirus type 8, and to a lesser extent human adenovirus type 3 (HX Jin et al., Molecular epidemiology of adenoviral conjunctivitis in Hanoi, Vietnam. Am J Ophthalmol. 2006 Dec;142(6):1064-6).

Further information concerning the aetiology and course of the current outbreak would be welcomed.
