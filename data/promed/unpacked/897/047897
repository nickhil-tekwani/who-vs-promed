H7N9 bird flu case confirmed in 2nd BC [Canada] patient
-------------------------------------------------------
A British Columbia [province, Canada] man has been confirmed as Canada's 2nd case of H7N9 bird flu. The unidentified man and his wife [the 1st case] are believed to have contracted the virus during a recent trip to China [see ProMED-mail 26 Jan 2015 Avian influenza, human (23): China (GD) H7N9, Canada 1st case 20150126.3120361]. They are the 1st North Americans known to have been infected with this virus.

BC's deputy provincial health officer says the positive test result was confirmed late Thursday [29 Jan 2015] by the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg [Manitoba province]. But Dr. Bonnie Henry says the province does not expect to see more cases associated with this event. She says none of the couple's contacts have become ill, and if they were going to, they would have by now.

The couple returned to Canada on 12 Jan 2015 and became ill a couple of days later. Both have since recovered.

[Michael Coston, Avian Flu Diary [edited] (http://afludiary.blogspot.com/2015/01/h7n9-confirmed-in-2nd-bc-patient.html): "It is remarkable that these cases were diagnosed at all, given their mild symptoms and their occurring during the midst of a very busy regular flu season. While 30 percent of known H7N9 cases have died, this is essentially the mortality rate among those sick enough to be hospitalized and tested. Unknown is how many mild or moderate cases occur each winter in China, that are never picked up by surveillance.

That 2 travelers should return from China with mild symptoms suggests that mild or moderate cases are more common than we know, something that the researchers at the University of Hong Kong have been saying for the past 18 months. In [H Yu, BJ Cowling, L Feng et al. 2013. Clinical severity of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. Lancet. July 13; 382(9887): 138-145. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3801178/], the investigators proposed, after roughly 130 cases were confirmed in the spring of 2013, that: 'Our estimate that between 1500 and 27 000 symptomatic infections with avian influenza A H7N9 virus might have occurred as of 28 May 2013, is much larger than the number of laboratory-confirmed cases.' How accurate these estimates are is unknown, but it is highly likely that the official case counts under-represent the real burden of H7N9, perhaps by a sizable margin.

Somewhat more reassuring, we've seen a relatively low number of family clusters or contacts of known cases test positive for the virus, suggesting a low human-to-human transmission rate. For now, direct contact with infected birds is believed the primary route of infection.

[Further support for that being the primary mode of transmission comes from a study reported in ProMED-mail earlier this week: Avian influenza, human (26): China (GD) H7N9, serologic study 20150128.3126626 (Ma MJ, Ma GY, Yang XX, et al. 2014. Avian Influenza A(H7N9) Virus Antibodies in Close Contacts of Infected Persons, China, 2013-2014. Emerg Infect Dis. Nov. DOI: 10.3201/eid2104.141442 http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2104.141442), which reported elevated levels of subtype H7N9 antibody among 6.7 percent of contacts during this epidemic in China (2013-2014). - Mod.LK] All of these seropositive contacts were asymptomatic.

All of which means we still have major gaps in our understanding of how fast and how far this virus is spreading in China. And given the amount of travel to and from Asia, we should not be surprised to see future introductions of H7N9, and other novel flu viruses, to North America."
