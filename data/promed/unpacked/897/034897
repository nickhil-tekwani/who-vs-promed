potato in Poland. Plant Dis 2010; 94, 920; DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-94-7-0920A]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
_Potato mop-top virus_ (PMTV) is a serious pathogen occurring in Northern
Europe, North and South America, and Asia that significantly reduces potato
(_Solanum tuberosum_) production. PMTV is transmitted by _Spongospora
subterranea_, the causal agent of potato powdery scab, and causes
characteristic brown arcs and circles (spraing symptoms) in potato tubers,
stunting of stems, shortening of internodes, and mosaic patterns (V-shaped)
on leaves, as well as leaf necrosis. _S. subterranea_ and PMTV are mainly
associated with cool, humid environments.

Between 2005 and 2009, extensive surveys for PMTV were conducted in Polish
potato fields with an emphasis on areas neighboring countries where the
virus had previously been reported. About 18 000 tubers from 39 cultivars
from different regions of Poland were collected. Tubers were first visually
inspected for symptoms within the flesh and then selected tubers were
analyzed by double-antibody sandwich (DAS)-ELISA. Symptomatic samples
tested by ELISA gave signals about 3-fold higher than negative controls and
about 2- to 5-fold lower than PMTV-positive controls.

RT-PCR on tubers testing positive for PMTV by DAS-ELISA amplified a 530-bp
product. No PMTV was detected in Poland between 2005 and 2007. In 2008, one
tuber (cv. Inwestor) from central Poland tested positive for PMTV and the
sequence and was submitted to GenBank. In 2009, additional infected tubers
were found in 3 Polish cultivars (Bartek, Glada, Ruta) from the same
county. Sequence comparisons revealed 99 per cent nucleotide identity and
approximately 98 per cent amino acid identity to Czech, Swedish, and
Finnish PMTV isolates.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of PMTV in Poland. Poland is one
of the major potato-producers in Europe with the 2008 crop around 10
million tonnes. If PMTV spreads in Poland, the virus could threaten potato
production.

[Potato mop-top virus (PMTV; genus _Pomovirus_, unassigned to a family)
spreads in Eurasia, South, and Central America. Other than potato, some
weed species of _Chenopodiaceae_ and _Solanaceae_ are commonly infected in
the Andean region but not elsewhere. Tuber yield may or may not be reduced,
but economic losses are due to quality being severely affected.

Tuber symptoms called "spraing" include brown lines, rings, and flecks.
They normally remain internal but occasionally may extend to the surface,
and some PMTV affected tubers may not show any symptoms. Spraing increases
in cool temperatures and with storage. Leaf and stem symptoms only appear
if infected tubers are planted. They depend on variety and environmental
conditions but may include yellow leaf blotches, leaf distortion, and
shortened internodes (mop-top).

PMTV is spread by the potato powdery scab pathogen _Spongospora
subterranea_ (recently reclassified from fungus to protozoan) where it is
retained in the sponge-like spore balls. The virus can survive in the
vector for up to 18 years in the soil. Viruliferous vector can be spread
with soil by human activities. PMTV transmission through tubers is variable
and not all stems produced by a PMTV-infected tuber may become infected. In
the absence of the vector it is thought that plants may become free of the
virus after 3 generations.

Disease management is difficult and generally directed at the vector. It
may include phytosanitation to minimise soil being carried on tubers or
equipment, cultural techniques, chemical treatments of seed tubers, soil
treatments to reduce spore numbers of the vector, and crop rotation
(particularly with _Brassica_ species).
