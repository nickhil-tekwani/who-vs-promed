Rift Valley fever in Mauritania
-------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MoH) in Mauritania declared an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) on 4 Oct 2012. From 16 Sep 2012 (the date of detection of the index case) to 30 Oct 2012, a total of 34 cases, including 17 deaths have been reported from 6 [of the 12 regions of Mauritania]. The last case was notified on 27 Oct 2012 from Magta Lahjar in the Brakna region. The 6 regions include Assaba, Brakna, Hodh Chargui, Hodh Gharbi, Tagant, and Trarza. All the cases had history of contact with animals.

In humans, 25 samples tested positive by ELISA and PCR at the National Reference Laboratory of the National Institute of Public Health Research (INRS) in Nouakchott [the capital city of Mauritania] and at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar. In the animal population, analysis conducted by the National Veterinary Research Laboratory shows virus circulation in several regions of the country.

A multi-sector task force has been jointly established by the MOH and the Ministry of Rural Development to respond to this outbreak. WHO and partners, including the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), are working within the task force to strengthen epidemiological surveillance in both human and animal health, strengthen capacity in case management at health care facilities, strengthen health measures in slaughterhouses, and raise awareness among farmers.

A multi-sector investigation team has been deployed to conduct a detailed outbreak investigation among humans and animals in the affected areas. An international team of experts will be deployed to provide technical assistance from 3 to 10 Nov 2012.

Mauritania experienced an outbreak of RVF in 2010. With regard to this outbreak, WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied.

[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects livestock but also has the capacity to infect humans. Infection can cause severe disease in both animals and humans. The disease also results in significant economic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected livestock. The vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses. Certain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians are, therefore, at higher risk of infection. There is some evidence that humans may also become infected with RVF by ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals. Human infections can also result occasionally from the bites of infected _Aedes_ spp. mosquitoes. Human-to-human transmission of RVF has been not been documented.

On 24 Oct 212 the Mauritanian Ministry of Health reported 30 human cases of Rift Valley fever infection, 13 of whom died. As of 1 Nov 2012 the number of confirmed cases has risen to 34, and the number of deaths to 17. It was suggested in the previous report that the outbreak was in decline now because the rainy season, which is one of the factors favouring the spread of the disease, has ended. However, no information has been provided, then or now, concerning the progress and extent of the outbreak in the animal population.
