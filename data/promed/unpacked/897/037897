Schmallenberg virus [SBV], which infects cattle, sheep, and goats has been detected for the 1st time in the Czech Republic.

So far, only 2 sheep farms, near the border with Germany, have been found affected. They are located in Smolne in Kraslice [Karlovy Vary region] and in Mosna in Prachatice [South Bohemia region].

The information published by Radiozurnal has been confirmed by the State Veterinary Administration.

Farmers in Smolne first noticed the disease about 14 days ago, but initially they did not pay attention because birth of deformed lambs is an occasional [incidental] event. But when it came to the 5th similarly damaged lamb, they thought it could be SBV. The State Veterinary Administration confirmed the diagnosis after an autopsy was performed.

A Czech Republic State Veterinary Administration web-page addressing SBV in Europe has been available since early 2012, last updated on 28 Feb 2012. Currently, it does not include information on the event reported above; see at http://www.svscr.cz/index.php?art=5368.]

[In case the findings above are officially confirmed, the birth of malformed lambs 14 days ago, may indicate that infection had taken place earlier, during the fall months, probably when the ewes were at their 2nd or 3rd month of pregnancy (average length of pregnancy for sheep is 147 days, in fact from 144 to 151 days). Such virus activity is likely to have similarly affected other susceptible ruminants, including cattle.

It would be interesting to note if surveillance in ruminants (bovines, ovines, caprines) has been undertaken by the veterinary authorities during 2012 and what results have been obtained. The published presence of SBV in neighbouring counties (Germany since 2011, Poland and Austria -- reportedly -- since September 2012) was predictive of its presence for some time also within the territory of the Czech Republic. Official confirmation, laboratory test results, and notification are anticipated. - Mod.AS
