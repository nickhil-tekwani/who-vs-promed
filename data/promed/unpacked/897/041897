SARCOCYSTIS NEURONA IN OPOSSUMS (2)
===================================
[1]

As one of the primary researchers in the study of EPM, I urge you
to reread your Equus article. While Dr. MacKay has recently emerged
on the EPM research scene, the laboratory of Dr. David Granstrom
has been working on this disease for years. I work in this laboratory
and the research to which you refer is my own.
Horses actually pick it up from ingesting sporocysts from tainted
anything, most likely in the pasture. The only treatment is pyrimethamine
(Daraprim) and a sulfa for four or more months (again, my research,
NOT Dr MacKay's).
Treatment is certainly effective as long as the duration of treatment
is sufficient, and the cost has come down to $200-300/mo, and can
be achieved in some areas for less than $200/mo.
The only Sarcocystis spp. that I am aware of in Didelphis
virginiana are S. falcatula and S. rileyi. My research has shown
that opossum sporocysts that have almost identical small ribosomal
subunit gene sequence to S. neurona are likely to be S. falcatula,
and cannot possibly S. rileyi.
As regards your questions:
[1] Are there any figures available with which to extrapolate rate of
occurence/infection among pops of D. virginiana?
So far, of mature opossums, I have personally found 60-80%
infected.
In what geographic regions has this been found?
The geographic range of opossums closely matches the geographic
distribution of EPM. This includes all of the US east of the
Rockies, and the west coast. Only the states between the Sierras
and the Rockies are free.
[2] Potkay's meager findings reported that symptoms were inapparent in
opossum carriers, and that only with heavily infected animals,
grey-white streaks were visible in affected muscle tissue at pathology.
Findings still hold?
I am unfamiliar with Potkay's work. However, the parasite is
restricted to the intestines of the definitive host (opossums),
and in non-pathogenic in opossums.
[3] Are there any prophylactic measures that can be taken with the resident
equines?
Search out and destroy opossums. Several other methods of control
have been recommended, but DO NOT work. Opossums can be live trapped
easily using apples, peanut butter or oatmeal cookies for bait.
Baiting with meat products is not recommended, because you will
attract a lot of other things. A few mls of euthanasia solution
injected intrathoracicly is very effective in killing them. (Check
with state and local fish and wildlife officials to find out how
and where you can trap them. In some states, killing them is
restricted to certain times of the year.)
>From an environmental standpoint, opossums are not actually native
to most of the US, despite their extensive range. Therefore, you cannot
upset any ecological balance by eliminating them. They are native
to the Southeastern states, however.

With the recent reports of opossums being the definitive host for
Sarcocystis neurona, will there be any attempt to limit the exposure
of foreign horses to possum feces while in Georgia for the Olympics?
