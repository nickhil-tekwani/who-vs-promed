The Health Ministry has discovered that a
46-year-old man who died in February [2009] in
the northwestern district of Bartyn was infected
with the hantavirus, a virus carried by rodents
that causes epidemic hemorrhagic fever and severe
respiratory infections in humans, making him the
first known victim of the virus in Turkey.

The man, who was hospitalized with symptoms of
fever, chills and nausea, died on 20 Feb [2009]
of "multi-organ failure in connection to acute
renal failure," according to his doctors. The
Health Ministry, however, recently announced that
the hantavirus was found in the man's blood and
was the cause of his death. Describing the virus
in a statement made about the death, the Health
Ministry said: "Some rodents carry the virus, and
it spreads through inhaling their droppings.
There are 2 types of hantavirus infections. One,
which causes lung failure, is widely seen in
America; the other, which causes renal failure,
is seen in Asia and Europe. The infection, which
is known to be seen in southern Russia and the
Balkans, has been discovered for the 1st time in
our country."

In the meantime, 12 people in Bartyn and 4 in the
city of Zonguldak have been hospitalized for
possible hanta virus infection. Including this
patient, the virus has been discovered in 8
people in the region so far.

The disease associated with the hantavirus is
called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome
(HFRS), a term that is accepted by the World
Health Organization (WHO). It was formerly called
Korean hemorrhagic fever. The appearance of the
virus causes flu-like symptoms in those infected.
The disease spreads through the saliva, urine and
droppings of deer mice, not through
person-to-person contact. The virus can be spread
through bites, but is typically is contracted
through inhaling dust from rodent droppings,
urine and saliva stirred into the air of garages,
cabins and other closed-off areas.

[It is unfortunate that this report refers to "a
hantavirus" as though there was just one such
virus, when, in fact, there are 4 recognized Old
World or European hantaviruses that could be
responsible for these hemorrhagic fever with
renal syndrome cases in Turkey. These, and their
rodent hosts, include: Dobrava virus (_Apodemus
flivicollis and _A. agararius_), Seoul virus
(_Rattus norvegicus and R. rattus_) and Puumala
virus (_Myodes glareolus_; synonymous with or
formerly classified as _Clethrionomys
glareolus_). _Apodemus agrarius_, the rodent host
for Hantaan virus, has also been reported from
Turkey.

In an article published in 2006, a field study of
rodents in Turkey reported, "Antibodies to
Puumala virus (family Bunyaviridae, genus
Hantavirus, PUUV) were detected in four of 65
_Microtus_ voles tested. Of the PUUV-IFA-positive
voles, one _Microtus guentheri lydius_ was caught
from Izmir, and one _Microtus roberti_ and two
_Microtus rossiaemeridionalis_ were captured near
Trabzon. All 264 _Apodemus_ spp. mice tested
negative for antibodies to Saaremaa virus (family
Bunyaviridae, genus Hantavirus, SAAV); the single
_Dryomys nitedula_ tested negative for both PUUV
and SAAV antibodies.
