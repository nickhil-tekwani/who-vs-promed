The specialists of Rospotrebnadzor [Territorial Directorate of the
Federal Services for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare] are
taking part in the investigation of the causes of an outbreak in
[Khanty-Mansi] among 14 people, who were admitted to the hospital
recently with the diagnosis of botulism. One of the patients died on
5 Feb 2008. According to preliminary data, the source of the outbreak
was homemade canned tomatoes.

The analysis of the events says that the relatives gathered for a
feast on 3 Feb 2008 and all ate canned tomatoes. The specialists of
Rospotrebnadzor and other agencies have taken specimens to
