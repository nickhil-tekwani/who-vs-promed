2002/076 Survey on _Erwinia amylovora_ in Slovakia: 2001 results
In 2001, a survey [for fireblight caused by] _Erwinia amylovora_ [Ea]
(EPPO A2 quarantine pest) was carried out in Slovakia. Visual
inspections and laboratory tests were done on host plants of
fireblight (_Malus_, _Pyrus_, _Cydonia_, _Mespilus_, _Sorbus_,
Crataegus_, _Pyracantha_, _Chaenomeles_, _Cotoneaster_,
_Amelanchier_) grown in ... fruit / ornamental nurseries, mother
stock orchards, commercial orchards (classic and high density) [and]
small fruit gardens, public parks [and] natural habitat of wild host
plants.
In 2001, 2 207 604 plants [7 311 ha] were inspected. Apple ... (1 821
000 trees, 6676 ha), ... pear ... (159 000 trees, 428 ha) and quince
trees (153 000, 29 ha) were the main species tested. 69 samples were
tested in the laboratory according to the EPPO Phytosanitary
Procedure no. 40. [No fireblight was detected].
The situation of Ea ... in Slovakia can be described as follows:
Absent: confirmed by survey.

[This is an encouraging development because Ea can cause very severe
disease, sometimes killing fruit trees. However, disease occurrence
can be erratic and freedom from fireblight in one year does not
guarantee freedom in the next year. The disease is exacerbated by
rainfall and high humidity, availability of overwintering inoculum on
infected source trees, and tree cultivar. Disease management involves
use of chemicals (copper sprays, antibiotics) and biological control
(protective bacteria such as _Pseudomonas fluorescens_ A506); pruning
of infected limbs; insect control (pathogen-contaminated insects
carry Ea to blossoms); cultural practices (induction of early
cessation of tree growth, avoidance of heavy applications of
fertilizer); and resistant cultivars.
