An apparent _Salmonella_ outbreak at a resort in Jamaica has ruined vacations for potentially dozens of holiday travelers -- and now some sickened guests are considering legal action, The Post has learned.

"It was a nightmare," a traveler from Lincoln, Nebraska, told The Post of her experience at the Grand Palladium Resort and Spa, which was echoed by other people online. "I don't know how many people go on an all-inclusive vacation and lose weight." She and her husband, secured their room at the 537-room beachside resort, which boasts 11 restaurants, 17 bars and "one of the largest swimming pools in the Caribbean," in February 2020 before the pandemic hit. But the island getaway dissolved into severe stomach and body cramps and diarrhea within 2 days of their arrival on 13 Dec 2020 -- tethering them to a bathroom at all times, the husband told The Post.

Another couple also had trouble in paradise. The couple, who live in Pittsburgh, squeezed in about 48 hours of fun before they were both felled by unrelenting diarrhea and vomiting on [14 Dec 2020], they said. They booked their $4000 honeymoon trip to the Palladium resort in 2020 after getting engaged in Jamaica, and held on to the reservation despite being forced to postpone their wedding. "My fianc√© was so weak and feverish, she could barely stand up," the man told The Post.

<Iwaspoisoned.com>, a platform that tracks food-borne illnesses, has tallied the number of guests who have allegedly become ill at the resort in December 2020 at close to 100, said the site's founder Patrick Quade, who based the tally on reports to websites like TripAdvisor, Orbitz, Booking.com and the resort's Facebook page. "We have never seen an outbreak this size in the past for Jamaica," he said.

The hotel is owned by the Palladium Hotel Group, a privately held Spanish hotel company that operates more than 50 properties in 6 countries, including Fiesta Hotels & Resorts and Hard Rock Hotel & Resorts, which didn't respond to multiple emails from The Post. The Jamaican Health Ministry also did not respond to queries from The Post.

The hotel's general manager, however, has offered online apologies to guests who complained publicly about their ordeal and has said "the situation" was being investigated. "We sincerely apologize for the experience and assure you that we will share your concerns with our food and beverage and accommodations management team so that they can follow up and take actions accordingly!" wrote Enrico Pezzoli in response to a poor review on TripAdvisor in December 2020.

A 22 year old, from Cleveland, Ohio, and her boyfriend were also still nursing weak digestive systems on [30 Dec 2020] after returning from their week-long stay at the Palladium on [19 Dec 2020]. Her boyfriend was also informed by a doctor here that he had contracted _Salmonella_. But they consider themselves among the lucky ones. "We spoke with other guests on the airplane and learned that 5 people from their group were hospitalized."

The outbreak comes at a time when food-borne illnesses have been on the decline in part because fewer people are eating in restaurants and more people are practicing better hygiene, said Hal King, founder of Public Health Innovations, a consulting firm.
