New cassava illness strikes in Mara
-----------------------------------
Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) is spreading at an alarming rate
in almost all districts of Mara Region, thus threatening the major
food crop that is widely grown in the lake zone, researchers from
Ukiruguru Institute [for agricultural research for the Lake and
Western Zone] have warned. They have now recommended alternative food
crops to be grown without delay, warning that there will be no
cassava plants in the area a year from now.

The new cassava disease threatens food security in the region with
over 1.6 million population, according to the Regional Agricultural
Advisor, Mr Samweli Sasi. "Earlier, CBSD was reported in the
neighbouring Ukerewe District of Mwanza Region but it has spread very
fast in Rorya, Musoma, and Bunda districts [of Mara region].
Ukiruguru has conducted the study now in all districts of Mara region
and the problem is big because they have not yet come up with
alternative cassava seeds to meet the demand," Mr Sasi said in a
regional business council meeting.

The report shocked the meeting with the Mara Regional Tanzania
Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture leader Mr Lazaro Magira
calling for a quick permanent solution in preventing further spread
of the diseases. "Growing alternative food crops is not a permanent
solution," he said.

Mara regional commissioner (RC) Mr Issa Machibya banned transporting
cassava seeds in a bid to contain the disease in the area. Bunda
district commissioner Mr Chiku Gallawa said all kind of cassava seeds
available in the region are in danger of being affected by the
disease.

[Cassava brown streak (or root rot) disease (CBSD) is caused by
_Cassava brown streak virus_ (CBSV; tentative member of genus
_Ipomovirus_) and is considered a threat to the whole of sub-Saharan
Africa. In Tanzania, the disease is reported to be the most limiting
factor for food security causing an annual loss of about USD 50
million.

Symptoms of CBSV may include leaf chlorosis, stem necrosis, and a
brown corky necrosis of the tubers resulting in root rot. However,
leaves may remain symptomless so that the problem is only discovered
at harvest, unlike for the very conspicuous cassava mosaic, another
viral disease of the crop (see recent ProMED-mail post no.
20081119.3647).

Total crop losses of 20-80 percent due to CBSV have been reported.
The virus is transmitted by the whitefly vector _Bemisia tabaci_ and
is spread to new areas by infected cassava cuttings. Disease
management includes pathogen exclusion, removal of infected plants,
use of virus-free seed tubers for planting, and vector control, but
these measures may be difficult to implement in developing countries.
Resistant varieties are being developed for specific local
requirements and are the best option for CBSV control in the long
term. From the report above it appears that at present susceptible
varieties are used in Mara Region.
