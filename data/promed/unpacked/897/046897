[The Sindh Province has historically had the highest incidence of malaria
in Pakistan. Epidemics have occurred at 6- to 10-year intervals, the last
one in 1972-73, and the present outbreak could be the start of a new
epidemic. About 40 percent of cases are due to _P. falciparum_, which is
significantly more common in the Sindh Province (64 percent). _P.
falciparum_ has developed resistance to chloroquine. The 2 main malaria
vectors -- _An. culicifacies_ and _An. stephensi_ are both resistant to
organochlorines and the latter has also developed resistance to an
organophosphate (Malathion). There is also massive importation of malaria
from Afghanistan. According to the recent Malaria Review Mission Report,
1998, malaria -- especially _P. falciparum_ -- is on the increase in
Pakistan. Slide-confirmed cases in the last 5 years have varied from a low
of 73 516 in 1998 to a high of 111 836 in 1995. Pakistan's population is
139 million, and therefore the annual parasite incidence is less than one
case per 1000. However, the actual level of malaria is at least 5 times
higher than suggested by official records, since these are based on the 20
percent of clients who use government services. According to a conservative
estimate, about 500 000 malaria cases occur per annum. Pakistan's malaria
control programme is also facing organisational problems due to
insufficient rapport between central headquarters and malaria control
programmes in provinces, rapid turnover of staff, and relocation of
recently trained specialists

Whether the present outbreak is related to change in insecticide spraying
policy is not known. - Mod.EP]
