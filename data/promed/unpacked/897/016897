This winter, common redpolls -- small red-capped finches that flock at
feeders -- have swarmed into Minnesota from Canada, delighting birdwatchers.
But in the past 3 weeks, birds have been dropping dead near feeders all over
the state, victims of salmonella.
People are being urged to remove finch feeders, clean them with a mild bleach
or vinegar solution and not replace them for a while to force the birds to
forage more widely, lessening the spread of the disease.
"Probably in the next 2 to 3 weeks they'll be moving north, spreading out
over thousands of miles of northern forest, and that will help greatly," said
Carrol Henderson, supervisor of non-game wildlife programs for the Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources.
Henderson urged cat owners to keep their pets inside for a while. Cats that
catch and eat sick birds can catch salmonella and become seriously ill.
Common redpolls are brownish finches with pale bellies and bright cherry-
colored caps. Males have rosy breasts. Usually full-time Canadian residents,
they move south in large numbers every 5 or 6 years during the winter because
of food shortages, Henderson said.
The birds are "beautiful little things and feed in swarms," thrilling
birdwatchers and driving up sales of thistle seed and ground peanut hearts,
he said. But last month, people all over Minnesota began reporting that
redpolls, some pine siskins and even a few native goldfinches were dying. The
Park Rapids area, in the northern part of the state, has seen evening
grosbeaks affected by the mystery disease.
Tests revealed the culprit to be salmonella B, a bacterial disease
transmitted by contact from bird to bird, from infected feeders and from
droppings that fall on seed on the ground. Henderson recommended cleaning up
the ground below feeders to reduce chance of transmission. Dead birds should
be disposed of.
It's a coincidence that the salmonella outbreak coincided with one of the
redpoll's periodic migrations into the United States, Henderson said. Similar
die-outs have been reported from Quebec to New York to Virginia and North
Carolina, he said. But he said the overall population should be fine because
birds that survive have more resistance and because they will scatter when
they migrate north again.

[This information seems strikingly similar to a previous posting on redpoll
finch mortality in Alaska (see ref).
A possible spread of Salmonella by finches should worry public health folks
at least to the same degree as it seems to worry cat lovers. Among the
Salmonella group B bacteria there are notorious pathogens such as _S.
typhimurium_, _S. agona_, _S. heidelberg_ and _S. brandenburg_.
If this is salmonellosis, are the bacteria the primary, direct cause of
disease and mortality among the birds, affecting all or most of them, or just
a secondary finding? Interestingly, during the 1997-1998 epizootic of
salmonellosis affecting several species of songbirds over a large area of the
eastern North American continent, the common redpoll (_Carduelis flammea_)
was found to be the species most often affected. (Daoust et al, 2000.
Salmonellosis in songbirds in the Canadian Atlantic provinces during winter-
summer 1997-98. Can Vet J. 41(1):54-59.)
1st-hand information from professional investigators and the veterinary
laboratories involved, including identification of the bacteria, will be
helpful. - Mod.AS]
[To quote from the post on the Alaska outbreak (ref. below):
"... if the Washington lab does not get a salmonella culture, it will
continue to work on the sample until it isolates the cause. Whatever the
outcome, ... it is likely the culprit is being passed from bird to bird at
feeders and that bird enthusiasts should continue to take precautions as if
the outbreak was salmonella. That includes cleaning feeders frequently and
disposing of dead birds so that pets do not become infected." Meaning that
the birds could be salmonella carriers but that salmonella is not the cause
of death. I suppose they should have the lab results by now. - Mod.JW]
