At least 10 cattle have died in Cobquecura due to an outbreak of anthrax or "la mancha" disease this fall [it is Autumn in the Southern Hemisphere. - Mod.MHJ]. According to Soy Chile, the outbreak would have cost the lives of about 10 head of cattle. Officials of the Local Development Program (Prodesal) - part of the Institute of Agricultural Development (Indap) - would have been vaccinating the animals in the area even before these cases appeared.

Claudio Campos, technical director of Prodesal, explained that this disease is present in the soil. "It is a bacterium that is present in the soils of this area and at certain times of the year it manifests with greater crudity, also when the animals are weaker or more vulnerable," said Campos.

The outbreak, according to Campos, would have started in the sector Talcamávida and then would have appeared in other areas. Once the emergence of the disease was known, the officials returned to the same places offering the vaccine to the farmers who had not accepted it the 1st time.

"This vaccination operation we are developing throughout the commune, the farmers who own animals are who have been asking for it," said Mayor Julio Fuentes. In this process the owners of cattle can buy, if they wish, the vaccine for 400 pesos [0.62 USD] or this plus some vitamins for 2500 pesos [4 USD]. They have already vaccinated some 700 animals and are expected to vaccinate another 200 in this new stage.

[Livestock anthrax is a constant sporadic problem in Bio Bio province. In 2009 there were 3 outbreaks involving cattle, horses, and sheep; in 2012, one bovine outbreak; in 2013, one sheep outbreak; in 2014, 2 bovine outbreaks; and in 2015, one sheep outbreak. As we have seen elsewhere, for example in North Dakota -- to take but one successful example --, one makes cattle vaccination compulsory, and have targeted vaccination for sheep. Eventually the farmers realise that the required vaccination has real advantages, comply, and the disease disappears. The anthrax spores are not immortal -- it is around 30 percent per year -- and eventually there are not enough to trigger a new case. But you have to vaccinate until you reach this state and any latent infections have gone. Once you are down to truly infrequent sporadic outbreaks, one can shift to targeted vaccination on and around problem farms.

From the Prodesal/Indap description the authorities are having problems getting the Bio Bio farmers to listen. While free vaccine works better, the Chilean price of 400 pesos or US 66c/individual dose is fair. The herds in Bio Bio are modest in size. - Mod.MHJ
