The Turkish press agency Anadolu has announced there is FMD in the district
Aksehir in the central Anatolian province Konya.
The Dutch news radio stated it was found on calves in 4 villages and the
Turkish government says everything is under control and they will vaccinate
where necessary. Next Monday and Tuesday a lot of animals will be
transported and slaughtered to celebrate an Islamitic feast, at the end of
Ramadan.

[It would be helpful to know what strain of FMD is in Turkey. However, I
understand the Turkish authorities have not released the strain. There are
implications to vaccination. Often at the end of an outbreak, vaccinated
animals are slaughtered as well. Antibodies produced by the vaccination are
indistinguishable from the antibodies produced by the natural disease.
Consequently, from an eradication standpoint, most governmental agencies
consider these animals to be infected.
ProMED-mail wishes to extend is wishes of deepest gratitude to the Pig
Disease Information Centre. The Center has been on top of a number of these
outbreaks, throughout the UK, and now Turkey, and has provided factual and
up to the minute information. Please accept our grateful thanks. The
website <http://www.pighealth.com> is an excellent source of information. -
