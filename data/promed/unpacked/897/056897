Five months after the death of a Warren County [New Jersey] woman, the state Department of Health has confirmed she died of a rare tick-borne disease never before seen in New Jersey. Her death in early May [2013] was caused by Powassan virus [infection], an illness so uncommon that just 8 other cases have been diagnosed in the United States this year [2013]. The unnamed 51-year-old woman had developed symptoms that included fever, headache, a rash, and encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain. She was taken and treated at an unnamed hospital and died there, a health department spokesman said. The physician treating the woman notified the state on 11 Nov 2013 that a tissue sample that had been sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had been confirmed for Powassan. The department declined to disclose the woman's hometown, citing privacy concerns.

The disease [virus] is spread by 2 kinds of ticks: the black-legged, or deer tick, which can also carry Lyme disease, and the woodchuck tick. While Lyme disease is rarely fatal, Powassan virus [infection] is fatal in 10 percent of cases, said Tom Mather, director of University of Rhode Island's Center for Vector-Borne Disease and its Tick Encounter Resource Center. Of the survivors, half will experience neurological complications, such as paralysis or cognitive problems. However, very few of the ticks New Jersey residents are likely to encounter are infected with the virus, he said. While more than half of adult-stage ticks are infected with the Lyme disease agent, only an estimated 1 percent have the Powassan virus.

"To put it in perspective, the tick infection rate with that virus is quite low," Mather said. It is not transmitted from person to person. The state decided against making any kind of announcement in mid-November [2013] about the confirmed case because tick season was over, according to spokesman Daniel Emmer.

That's an incorrect assumption, said Mather, a public health entomologist. "To say it's no longer tick season, it's just irresponsible," he said. "There's hardly a month where you couldn't encounter a tick." Ticks are not killed off by cold weather. They merely become so sluggish they no longer "quest," or search for food, Mather said. So-called tick season does flourish in the summer months, mostly because ticks are then in their smallest nymphal stage, so their presence goes unnoticed, he said. Tick activity slows once the temperature drops below 20 degrees, but will bounce back after just a few days of above-freezing weather.

Nationally, about 50 cases of Powassan have been reported in the United States over the past decade [2003-2013]. Most were in the northern woodlands of Minnesota, Wisconsin and New York. So far this year [2013], the CDC has confirmed 8 other cases: 4 in Wisconsin, 3 in New York and 1 in New Hampshire. One of the New York cases killed a teenager in Poughkeepsie, according to news reports. Symptoms may show up one week to one month after being bitten by an infected tick. While an infected tick has to stay attached to a person for at least 24 to 48 hours to transmit Lyme disease, that timetable is thought to be shorter for the Powassan virus. The CDC states there is no specific treatment for Powassan [virus infection]. Those with a severe case of the illness may need to receive respiratory support, intravenous fluids, or medications to reduce swelling in the brain.

Powassan is named for the Ontario [province, Canada] community where it was 1st discovered in 1958. Prevention advice is the same as that for avoiding Lyme disease: long-sleeved clothing and pants while walking in tall grass or woods, and insect repellent.

[Human Powassan (POW) virus infections have been recognized in the United States, Canada and Russia. In the United States, cases of POW virus disease have been reported primarily from northeastern states and the Great Lakes region. These cases occur primarily in the late spring, early summer and mid-fall when ticks are most active.

According to the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/powassan/): Powassan (POW) virus is transmitted to humans by infected ticks. Approximately 50 cases of POW virus disease were reported in the United States over the past 10 years. Most cases have occurred in the Northeast and Great Lakes region. Signs and symptoms of infection can include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, seizures, and memory loss. Long-term neurological problems may occur. There is no specific treatment, but people with severe POW virus illnesses often need to be hospitalized to receive respiratory support, intravenous fluids, or medications to reduce swelling in the brain. - Mod.CP
