The Western Cape Agriculture Department has imposed an embargo on the
movement of horses into the province. This follows an outbreak of African
horse sickness (AHS) in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape.

Spokesperson for the provincial Agriculture Ministry, Alie van Jaarsveld,
says the decision was taken to protect horses currently in the Export Zone.
He says more R200 million [25 417 172.70 USD] was lost a few years ago due
to a ban placed on imports by the European Union.
