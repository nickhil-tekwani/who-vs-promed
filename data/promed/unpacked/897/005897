Study: Ebola outbreak in DRC not related to West Africa epidemic
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ebola virus responsible for an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that began in July [2014] bears similarities to previous outbreaks in equatorial Africa but is distinct from the virus causing the ongoing epidemic in West Africa and has a different zoonotic origin, say results of a study today [15 Oct 2014] in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The DRC outbreak began near the town of Boende in the Equateur province and has remained confined to that province. From 26 Jul through 7 Oct [2014], there have been a total of 69 suspected or confirmed cases, 8 of them among healthcare workers, says the study. Case numbers peaked in the 2nd half of August and have now fallen. 49 deaths have been reported.

The most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report on the outbreak, from 9 Oct [2014], says there have been 68 cases and 49 deaths.

The study authors say genome sequencing of samples from DRC patients revealed a local variant of Ebola Zaire as the cause. It showed 99.2 percent identity with the most closely related variant from a large outbreak in Kikwit, southwest of Boende, in 1995. The virus showed 96.8 percent identity to the strain now circulating in West Africa.

The index case was in a pregnant woman who cut up a dead monkey that her husband had discovered. She became ill and died about 2 weeks later. A doctor and 3 health workers who did a postmortem cesarean section on her also became ill and died. Further cases followed.

The authors speculate that among the reasons the current and past DRC Ebola outbreaks have stayed more contained than the West African outbreak is that the former have occurred in more remote areas with fewer human contacts and that the response in the DRC has been rapid, with more experience gained with each one (the DRC has had 6 previous Ebola outbreaks since it was 1st seen there in 1976).

[The cited New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) paper provides succinct background, epidemiology and viral genome sequencing from the outbreak, which appears to be nearing its end. As previously reported in ProMED and elsewhere, the outbreak is distinct from and unrelated to the one in West Africa.

The abstract of the NEJM paper (the full paper with figures is available at the URL above):

"Background
-----------
The 7th reported outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the equatorial African country of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) began on [26 Jul 2014], as another large EVD epidemic continued to spread in West Africa. Simultaneous reports of EVD in equatorial and West Africa raised the question of whether the 2 outbreaks were linked.

"Methods
-------
We obtained data from patients in the DRC, using the standard World Health Organization clinical-investigation form for viral hemorrhagic fevers. Patients were classified as having suspected, probable, or confirmed EVD or a non-EVD illness. Blood samples were obtained for polymerase-chain-reaction-based diagnosis, viral isolation, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis.

"Results
-------
The outbreak began in Inkanamongo village in the vicinity of Boende town in Equateur province and has been confined to that province. A total of 69 suspected, probable, or confirmed cases were reported between [26 Jul and 7 Oct 2014], including 8 cases among health care workers, with 49 deaths. As of [7 Oct 2014], there have been approximately 6 generations of cases of EVD since the outbreak began. The reported weekly case incidence peaked in the weeks of [17 Aug and 24 Aug 2014] and has since fallen sharply. Genome sequencing revealed Ebola virus (EBOV, Zaire species) as the cause of this outbreak. A coding-complete genome sequence of EBOV that was isolated during this outbreak showed 99.2 percent identity with the most closely related variant from the 1995 outbreak in Kikwit in the DRC and 96.8 percent identity to EBOV variants that are currently circulating in West Africa.

"Conclusions
--------------
The current EVD outbreak in the DRC has clinical and epidemiologic characteristics that are similar to those of previous EVD outbreaks in equatorial Africa. The causal agent is a local EBOV variant, and this outbreak has a zoonotic origin different from that in the 2014 epidemic in West Africa.
