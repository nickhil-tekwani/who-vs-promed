CJD-BSE CONNECTION? - UK (6)
============================
Subject: A Clarification
Hello All,

In a message that I posted on Sunday 14 January, I included an item
that read --

"At the time of the IFST Position Paper, (7 December), the most that
scientific knowledge could say was that there was no evidence that
BSE could be transmitted to humans. Even then, the research of Prusiner
was suggesting that the species barrier between cattle and man was
very much more difficult to cross than between cattle (or sheep) and
other animals. At that time the possibility of BSE transmission to
humans was therefore judged to be very small and remote. The
regulations prohibiting entry into the human food chain of certain
specified parts of the cow including those shown to be capable of
carrying the BSE infective agent, were judged to be a desirable
"belt-and-braces" approach in the unlikely event of even that very small
and remote possibility occurring. These bans need to be rigorously
applied and enforced, and strengthened where experience shows the need
to do so. The publication in Nature, on 21 December, of the research of
Collinge et al, indicates that the possibility of transmission to humans
(even by intracerebral injection) now looks even smaller and more remote."

I am grateful to a fellow-subscriber who has drawn my attention to the
possibility that the phrase referring to Prusiner's research was open to
misinterpretation, and he is quite right to do so and thus give me the
opportunity to clarify the phrase. Although the phrase referring to
Prusiner did not say, and was not intended to imply, that Prusiner's
research was on BSE, it was indeed open to that misinterpretation. The
phrase did not occur in the Position Statement itself. Prusiner (in which
I include his colleagues) may or may not have done research on BSE during
the past twelve months, but the latest of which we were aware at the time
of the Position Statement or at the time of my posting was the paper in
Scientific American of January 1995. The relevant research reported in
that paper was carried out with scrapie, not BSE, but the results obtained,
and Prusiner's interpretation of their significance, did "suggest" that
the species barrier for prion diseases between animals and humans was much
harder to cross than those between animals. It was only with the results
of Collinge et al, published two weeks after the Position Statement, that
this was actually demonstrated with BSE.
