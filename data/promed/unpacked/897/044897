According to Yonhap News, Korean health authorities on Friday [19 Feb
2010] confirmed the country's 1st cholera patient of 2010. The
unidentified patient who had visited Jakarta and Bali showed symptoms
of the disease upon arrival and was checked by the quarantine office
at Incheon International Airport, the Korea Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention [KCDC] said.

The checkup showed the person testing positive for _Vibrio cholerae_
O1, biotype Ogawa. The KCDC said it has acquired the list of 22 people
who had traveled with the cholera patient to check if they had caught
the disease as well.

As a short review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _V. cholerae_ are
shared with many water vibrios and, therefore, are of no use in
distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic)
antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139
known serotypes. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are
nonvirulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which is
"non-O1"), a single serotype, designated O1, has been responsible for
epidemic cholera.

There are 3 distinct O1 biotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima,
each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype. The
biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A,
B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba antigens A and C; and
Hikojima antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare.

[2] Cholera - Cambodia (Phnom Penh)

The Pasteur Institute in Phnom Penh reported 3 more cases of cholera
on Monday [15 Feb 2010] and health officials continued to urge the
public to wait for more data before speculating about the prospect of
an epidemic.

Muy Sovann, director of administration at the Pasteur Institute, said
the institute had been receiving between 3 and 5 samples positive for
cholera from medical facilities in Phnom Penh every day for the past 2
weeks.

"We don't know the number of patients who have died from this disease,
because we only receive samples from the hospitals and private
clinics, not detailed information about patients," he said.

Ly Sovann, deputy director of the Health Ministry's Communicable
Diseases Control Department, said most Cambodians did not understand
the technicalities of epidemics and should refrain from speculation.

From 12 to 18 Feb 2010, 7 cases of cholera, of which 2 resulted in
deaths, were recorded at the district hospital of Bocoio, 102 km [63
mi] northeast of the city of Benguela. In declarations to ANGOP, the
local supervisor of the cholera treatment centre, Samuel Kaputula,
said that the cases were diagnosed at Lukunga village, in the commune
of Passe, and the 5 hospitalized patients are already out of danger
and receiving medical treatment at the aforesaid center.

He stressed that the consumption of non-treated water and poor basic
sanitation in the region are the main factors that led to the
outbreak. Samuel Kaputula, who did not disclose data relating to the
same period of 2009, said that to avoid the spread of the disease at
Lukunga village, the health sector is distributing treatment for
drinking water.

Health officials in Zimbabwe said Wednesday [17 Feb 2010] cholera had
killed 9 people in the southern district of Mwenezi, and that it
appeared to be spreading to neighboring regions. Provincial medical
director Robert Mudyiradima said medical teams had been dispatched to
the district and surrounding areas to contain the disease.

He said a further 8 cases of cholera were under treatment in Mwenezi,
and there were signs the disease was spreading. "We are doing all that
we can to make sure that the situation is under control and at the
moment we have been disinfecting several wells in areas affected by
the outbreak," he said.

In 2009, cholera killed more than 4000 people and infected over 100
000 others in an outbreak which drew the attention of the whole world.
