Dr. Sheeja said the increasing number of leptospirosis cases in the district was another major public health concern. She said a total of 69 leptospirosis cases had been reported from the district as on Thursday [21 Jun 2018].

Dr. Sheeja said most of the leptospirosis cases had been found in workers attached to the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and Kudumbasree Mission, who work in waterlogged areas.

Callous dumping of waste in public places and clogged canals had made many parts of the district safe breeding grounds for mosquitoes and rodents. Polluting fresh-water sources with waste from chicken stalls, slaughterhouses, hotels, and markets had become a major public health menace in Pathanamthitta.

It is high time the district administration and the local self-government institutions initiated effective punitive measures to contain the pollution problem, Kurien Oommen, senior medical consultant, said.
