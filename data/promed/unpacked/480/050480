_Listeria_ outbreak linked to fresh express salads
--------------------------------------------------
Total illnesses: 10
Hospitalizations: 10
Deaths: 1
Last illness onset: 19 Oct 2021
States with cases: Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.

A full list of recalled products is available on FDA's website [https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/fresh-express-announces-recall-fresh-salad-products-due-potential-health-risk].

The FDA and CDC, in collaboration with state and local partners, are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections [https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/outbreak-investigation-listeria-monocytogenes-fresh-express-packaged-salad-december-2021]. According to the CDC, as of 21 Dec 2021, 10 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 8 states. Illnesses started on dates ranging from 26 Jul 2016 to 19 Oct 2021.

As a part of routine sampling, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) collected a product sample of Fresh Express Sweet Hearts salad mix with a Use-By-Date of 8 Dec 2021 for testing. The sample tested positive for _L. monocytogenes_ and subsequent whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis determined that the _L. monocytogenes_ present in the samples matches the strain that has caused illnesses in this outbreak.

In response to the sample results and the ongoing outbreak investigation, Fresh Express voluntarily ceased production at the Streamwood, Illinois, facility and initiated a recall of certain varieties of its branded and private label salad products produced at the company's Streamwood, Illinois facility. The recall includes all Use-By Dates of fresh salad items with product codes Z324 through Z350. Product codes are located on the front of the packages below the Use-By Date, as shown above.

[In the USA, the CDC identifies a listeriosis outbreak when a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates have the same molecular pattern based on whole genome sequencing (WGS), suggesting a common food source. Epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the _Listeria_ case report from patients in the cluster to identify the common source.

Food items likely to be contaminated with _Listeria_, include soft cheeses and ready-to-eat (RTE) refrigerated meat products that do not require further cooking before eating, such as smoked salmon, sushi, and cold cut meats. Even if initial contamination adds only a few _Listeria_ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods because _L. monocytogenes_ can multiply at refrigerator temperatures to a sufficient number to cause disease when the food is ingested.

People at increased risk for disseminated listeriosis, which include pregnant women (and their newborns), adults aged 65 years or older, and people with weakened immune systems, should avoid eating food potentially contaminated with _Listeria_. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, their infections can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or even stillbirth.

PulseNet (a national laboratory network that collects information about _Listeria_ isolates) works with other federal food regulatory agencies (the US FDA and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA/FSIS) to find isolates found in food-monitoring programs that have similar genotypes, which would implicate them as the common source.

In the current multistate listeriosis outbreak, 10 patients, with illness onsets between July 2016 and October 2021, had clinical isolates with similar genotypes, based on WGS. Routine sampling of Fresh Express Sweet Hearts salad mix with a Use-By-Date of 8 Dec 2021 tested positive for the outbreak strain of _L. monocytogenes_ by WGS, confirming this as the common source. In response, salad products produced at the company's Streamwood, Illinois facility were recalled. Since listeriosis has an incubation period of up to 70 days, more cases are possible. How the food items became contaminated was not disclosed. The outbreak investigation is said to be ongoing. - Mod.ML
