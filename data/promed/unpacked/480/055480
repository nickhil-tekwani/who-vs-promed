A warning has been issued over [a] virus infection threat to cereal harvests. Growers should be aware of the higher risks of barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) infection in crops sown this autumn [2017] and were advised by Hutchinsons' [Crop Consultants] Cam Murray to make every effort to mitigate the possible impacts.

He said that pressure in several areas of Scotland had been "excessive" after large flights of aphids through spring, with classic yellowing symptoms found in spring oats, barley, and wheat. "This means that early-sown winter barley crops will be at particularly high risk this autumn," he said. The most effective way to protect early growth was to use a seed treatment and well-timed follow-up spray.

Oat fields in central Manitoba are fighting off barley yellow dwarf virus. ManÂ­itoba Agriculture's Holly Derksen said, "I think this is probably the most severe that I've seen it." It is unclear if there are other, unreported, cases. The virus also may take root in its namesake barley or other cereals like wheat.

"It does seem like this year [2017] there are some bigger patches and when it is a severely infected plant you will not have seed production," she said. "It really depends on the incidence in the field, but if there are big patches that are affected, there could be some significant yield loss."

[Barley yellow dwarf (BYD) disease occurs worldwide and affects a wide range of grass species (Gramineae) including cereal crops like barley, wheat, oats, rice, maize, and rye. It is the most destructive of the virus diseases for wheat. Grain yields may be reduced by 1/3. Symptoms include leaf discolouration from yellow to purple (depending on the host species), stunting, reduced tillering, and empty seed heads. Plants infected in autumn may not survive the winter or show severe symptoms when growth resumes. Diseased plants often occur in circular patches within a field, which are associated with colonisation by the aphid vectors.

BYD viruses have now been split into several species in the family Luteoviridae (mostly in the genus _Luteovirus_). They are differentiated by their ability to be transmitted by various aphid species (family Aphididae) and their virulence on a selected variety of oats. Some of the viruses are transmitted equally well by several aphids, whereas others can be transmitted by only one or 2 species. The bird cherry(-oat) aphid (_Rhopalosiphum padi_) and grain (wheat) aphid (_Sitobion avenae_) are vectors of the severe _Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV_ (type member of genus _Luteovirus_). Coinfections of several BYD viruses may occur in one plant, which can result in either more severe (synergistic) or milder (due to cross protection) symptoms, depending on the virus partners.

The viruses cannot be transmitted by seed, pollen, or mechanical means and cannot survive in stubble or in the soil. Volunteer cereal plants or grassy weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management includes use of crop cultivars with reduced sensitivity to the viruses and control of the aphid vectors.

In Europe, a current outbreak of BYD is also being reported from Ireland (ProMED-mail post 20170609.5094454).
