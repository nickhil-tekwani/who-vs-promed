India: Hepatitis E virus outbreak in Dum Dum district, West Bengal
----------------------------------------------
More than 800 persons have been infected with hepatitis E virus in South
Dum Dum in West Bengal, India, during the past 3 weeks. The affected areas
are Chasipara, Lalgarh, Moyrapara, Azadgarh, Burmanpara, Sethbagan,
Chasirmat, Goalabagan, Basakbagan, and Swamiji colony of the Municipal
areas of South Dum Dum. The outbreak appears to be due to contamination of
the water supply in the affected areas. The main manifestation was
jaundice. Although at least 15 relapse cases were reported in Moyrapara,
Azadgarh, and Goalabagan areas, there was no report of any death from the
disease. It has been observed that about 30 percent of the cases have
already been cured.
Virologists attached to the School of Tropical Medicine, Kolkata have
examined 20 blood samples from the affected persons, out of which 15
samples were positive for hepatitis E virus IgM antibody. At present,
drinking water is being supplied by 12 large tankers, halogen tablets are
being distributed, and health workers have already visited at least 280
houses. Municipality engineers are now planning for the replacement of 1000
meters of asbestos water supply pipeline -- where contamination was
suspected -- with iron pipes.

[Like many enteric viruses, hepatitis E virus possesses a single-stranded
positive-sense RNA genome within an icosahedral particle. However, it is
not closely related, phylogenetically, to other enteric viruses but is
classified as a unique virus genus. Hepatitis E virus displays a strong
tropism for hepatocytes, and it is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. It
is responsible for an acute self-limited infection characterized as acute
hepatic inflammation. It has been claimed, however, that in endemic areas
in India, hepatitis E virus may be a common cause of acute liver failure.
The earliest documented cases of hepatitis E virus infection occurred in
India (Dehli) in 1955 after heavy flooding. Subsequently sporadic outbreaks
have been recorded throughout Asia, Africa, and Central America, usually in
association with contaminated drinking water. Pigs, rats, deer, and some
other animals may act as alternate hosts. No vaccine is available at
present. - Mod.CP]
