[There was an outbreak of a purportedly novel serotype of bluetongue
in Russia within the last month - see reference below. For those
interested in details, I recommend reading Mod. AS comments covering
the history of bluetongue in Russia that also calls for additional
information on the "chronology, geography, epidemiology and on the
animal population involved" in the current outbreak in the Smolensk
region. Some of that information is provided in this report but a more
comprehensive explanation of the epidemiology and extent of spread
since first reported last month would be helpful. Furthermore, only
subclinical disease and no other locations involved would be helpful
in understanding the dimension of this potentially novel virus. -
