The Netherlands has confirmed its 11th case of foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD). This follows the 3 new cases on Thursday, and comes amid a cull of
100 000 animals designed to prevent the spread of the disease.
In Germany, an alert was sounded after pigs at Goch, near the Dutch border,
showed signs of the illness. Test results are due on Saturday.
The latest Dutch case was discovered in the eastern province of Gelderland,
where the disease first struck last week, and has been linked to animals
imported via the French department of Mayenne. The central province of
Veluwe is the only other region of the country affected, after a case not
linked to Mayenne imports was discovered in Kootwijkerbroek on Thursday.
Angry farmers there briefly held hostage 3 workers from the country's Meat
and Animal Inspection Service, and erected blockades to protest against the
preventive slaughter of thousands of healthy livestock, on Friday.
The Dutch Agriculture Minister, Laurens-Jan Brinkhorst, said he wanted
Europe to revisit the idea of mass vaccination of livestock to avoid such a
slaughter in future. He said, "I believe that increasingly, at least in
this country, there is growing resistance to hundreds of thousands of
animals which are perfectly healthy for human consumption should be
slaughtered...Many people do not understand in this country why one should
slaughter massively if by simple vaccination one could avoid the outbreak."
He said the Netherlands would not take unilateral action, but that European
agriculture ministers would return to the issue at a meeting in Sweden next
week.
Until last week, Dutch officials had believed their early crackdown on the
movement of animals, coupled with a vaccination program, had been enough to
protect the country from the spread of FMD. The UK has not yet begun
vaccination, with the government continuing to insist its mass burning of
slaughtered animals is the answer. The UK's total has passed 770 cases and
is still rising daily.
In France, where 2 cases have been confirmed, an uneasy waiting game is
still going on amid hopes the virus has been stopped in its tracks. The
suspected case in Germany concerns 2 pigs imported from the Netherlands
before 1 Feb 2001.
