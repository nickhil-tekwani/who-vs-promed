Preparing for West Nile fever
-----------------------------
The government confirmed yesterday [26 Jun 2002] unanimously a budget of
10.5 million NIS [appx 2.15 million US dolars] for the preparations facing
a renewed outbreak of West Nile fever. The disease, transmitted to humans
by mosquitoes bites, is expected during late summer.
The money is needed for preventive activities, including improved vector
eradication, virus monitoring in the mosquitoes, virus identification in
the lab and early detection of virus in domestic poultry and wild avians,
which are the source of virus transmission to man through the mosquito. In
addition, the budget should serve the local authorities for public
information and extension activities. The budget will be divided between
five State ministries: Environment, Defence, Interior, Health and Agriculture.
Following the decision, the Minister for the Environment, Zachi Hannegbi,
expressed the hope that the early deployment will help "soften the blow"
and "repeat last year's success".
During 2001, 3 WNF patients died, compared to 29 who died from the virus
during 2000.

Mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus found in southern Israel
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry for the Environment said Thursday [18 Jul 2002] that checks by
its department for pest control have revealed mosquitoes carrying the West
Nile virus in the Yotvata region, which is located in the southern part of
the Arava, and in Mitzpeh Shalem, north of the Dead Sea.
This is the second time this year that mosquitoes infected with the virus
have been found in the area. Infected mosquitoes were found 2 months ago
close to Kibbutz Or Haner in the northern Negev.
In light of the most recent discovery, the Environment Ministry proposed
that the local regional council spray the area in an effort to reduce the
mosquito population.
The virus is a mosquito-born ailment that is picked up from infected fowl.
It can be fatal to the elderly and young babies and can result in spinal
meningitis. The disease is treated symptomatically for its high fevers and
vomiting.
According to Dr. Emilia Anis, the deputy head of the Health Ministry's
epidemiology department, for every case of the illness that requires
hospitalization, there are 4 cases that are not diagnosed as West Nile
fever and another 140 cases in which no symptoms of the disease appear.
The disease was first diagnosed in Israel in 1953 and over the next 3
decades there were a number of outbreaks. By the end of the 1970s, however,
no significant outbreaks of the illness occurred, until manifestations
began again in the late 1990s. In 2000, the disease reached epidemic
proportions, with some 452 cases and 29 deaths reported.

[No clinical case of West Nile fever has been recorded (yet) this year in
Israel; the disease season might begin soon. According to the Public Health
Services, the diagnosis rate of clinical cases is estimated to be
approximately one to 10 (and not one to 4, as stated in the news item). We
are grateful to Dr Emilia Anis, Director of the Department of Infectious
Diseases in the Public Health Services, Ministry of Health, for her kind
update. - Mod.AS]
