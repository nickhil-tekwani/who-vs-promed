WHO: Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo stabilises
--------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo [Congo DR] has stabilised, with no new deaths or cases in more than a week, the World Health Organisation (WHO) stated on Tue 23 Oct 2012. For the past 10 days, the death toll from the haemorraghic fever has remained at 36 and no new cases have been registered, the WHO said in a bulletin. The last case of hospitalisation dates back to 11 Oct 2012, according to the statement released to the press on Tuesday [23 Oct 2012]. A total of 75 people are believed to have been infected and the fatality rate in the outbreak went to 48 percent.

"We are very, very vigilant," WHO Kinshasa representative Leodegal Bazira told AFP. "It takes just one case to start up a cycle of transmission." The fact that the disease had been confined to the town of Isiro and its neighbourhood was a positive factor, he added. An epidemic was declared in mid-August [2012] in the northeastern Orientale Province. But researchers have dated the outbreak back to May.

The Ministry of Health, the WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) based in Atlanta, Georgia, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), [and the USAID PREDICT project] have been working in close cooperation to combat the outbreak. To date, there is no treatment or vaccine for Ebola [virus disease], which kills between 25 and 90 percent of those who fall sick, depending on the strain of the virus, according to the WHO. The disease is transmitted by direct contact with blood, faeces, and sweat, by sexual contact and by unprotected handling of contaminated corpses.

Congo DR has recorded 8 outbreaks of Ebola virus disease, one of the world's most virulent diseases, since the virus was first reported near a Congolese river that gave the disease its name in 1976.

[The previous confusion over the extent of the outbreak and the numbers of cases and fatalities, is now resolved. A total of 75 people are believed to have been infected, 36 of whom have died, giving a fatality rate of 48 percent.

A map of the provinces of DRC is available at http://www.mapsofworld.com/democratic-republic-of-congo/democratic-republic-of-congo-political-map.html and the interactive ProMED-mail/HealthMap of Congo DR can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/35-r. - Mod.CP]

[The difficulty of getting outbreaks reported from remote areas of the country is shown; this one perhaps began in May 2012 but was only reported in August. There must be at least 21 days -- one maximum incubation period -- after the last case before the outbreak can be declared over. - Mod.JW]
