The Institute of Public Health (ISP) confirms the detection of a case of atypical rabies in a bat discovered on [14 Oct 2017] by an individual in Etalle (province of Luxembourg). A 1st case of this viral disease had already been spotted at Bertrix [province of Luxembourg] a year ago.

After several laboratory tests, the ISP confirms on its website that it has diagnosed rabies in a bat (_Eptesicus seronitus_ or common serotine). This is the 2nd proven case of the presence of the atypical rabies virus (European bat lyssavirus) in this species in the Belgian territory.

Discovered on [14 Oct 2017] by an individual in the town of Etalle in the province of Luxembourg, the suspect animal was sent for analysis to the ISP, the only scientific institution officially authorized to confirm the diagnosis of this fatal disease in Belgium.

Apart from the 2 people who handled the bat when it was sent to the ISP -- and who wore suitable protective gloves -- no human or animal contact was reported. Therefore, any risk of contamination, seems reasonably discarded.

[The 1st case of European bat lyssavirus (EBLV) in Belgium was reported in September 2016 (see ProMED archive no. 20161104.4607552). EBLV constitute a separate group of lyssaviruses. Infections by European bat lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1) appears to be the most prevalent variant, and have been reported in bats and humans in Northern Europe. Within this group there is a further division into subtypes (genotypes) 1 and 2. Phylogenetic analysis has identified 2 lineages within the EBLV-1 genotype, supported by geographical separation. EBLV-1a is distributed over northern Europe between the Netherlands and Russia, whilst EBLV-1b is found only in Western Europe along an axis from Spain to the Netherlands. This is why it was expected to be present in Belgium. - Mod.PMB
