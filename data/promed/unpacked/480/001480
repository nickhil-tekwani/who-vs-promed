Two hospital admissions for anthrax in the Tambov Region
--------------------------------------------------------
Two inhabitants of the Sosnovskaya district of the Tambov Region have been
admitted to the Tambov Infectious Diseases hospital with a diagnosis of
anthrax. The information came from Vladimir Pominov, the director in charge
of the Regional Veterinary Agency, according to an ITAR TASS report.
Mr Pominov said that a man and a woman came from the villages Andreevka and
Zelenoe, where a couple of days ago, cattle had been slaughtered. One of
the patients, Mr Pominov said, is in a serious condition.
The response of the Veterinary Service of the Sosnovskaya district was very
prompt, and the infected meat has been collected. The carcasses of the
animals have been burned. Now measures are being taken to localize the
source of the infection, quarantine has been established, and the places of
slaughter of cattle are being covered by concrete.

[In some countries, they slaughter animals sick with anthrax. Why, I don't
know, as cattle do respond well to treatment, and it just increases the
mess and contamination and just disinclines owners from reporting disease.
Also, if you are burning carcasses, one can shovel up any bloody soil and
throw it into the fire. For disinfecting soil, refer to WHO's Anthrax
Guide:
