Russia: Rotavirus outbreak in Khabarovsk
---------------------------------------
More than 50 children with classical symptoms of gastrointestinal
illness caused by rotavirus infection have sought medical attention
in hospitals and out-patient departments in Khabarovsk during the
past week [11-17 Mar 2007]. Epidemiologists believe that the cold
seasons of the year are the most favorable time for outbreaks of
rotavirus infection.
Tatyana Karavjanskaja, Head of the Epidemiological Department of the
Khabarovsk branch of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for
Surveillance of Consumer Rights and Human Welfare - Mod.NP] recalled
that in recent years, rotavirus infection had replaced bacterial
dysentery as the prime cause of gastroenteritis during the cold
seasons of the year in the Khabarovsk region. This has been apparent
throughout the whole country and not just in the Khabarovsk region.
Interestingly, adults who contract rotavirus infection do not as a
rule become ill and are unaware of the infection. Thus, they become
vectors of rotavirus, and involuntarily become dangerous to children.
Infants up to the age of 3 are especially susceptible to rotavirus
infection and may exhibit high temperature, vomiting and diarrhea.
Some patients require admission to infectious disease wards in hospitals.
Rotaviruses are resistant in the environment and survive on surfaces,
utensils, toys, and inadequately washed fruit and vegetables. It is
possible to contract rotavirus disease if elementary rules of
personal hygiene are ignored. Epidemiologists believe that not all
mothers wash children's toys on a regular basis or wash fruit such as
bananas and tangerines. For prevention of rotavirus disease,
physicians emphasize the need to observe basic rules of hygiene and
in an affected household to allocate separate utensils and materials
to a sick child.

[An increase in rotavirus morbidity is observed usually during winter
and early spring. Children of preschool age are the most vulnerable.
Rotavirus infection is transmitted by infected products and water. In
the city of Khabarovsk and throughout the Khabarovsk and Nanaian Amur
districts, an increase in morbidity has been observed from the end of
December 2006, mainly in children under 3 years old: see
<http://www.regnum.ru/news/769925.html>.
The Khabarovsk region is in the far eastern part of Russia, bounded
in the east by the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan. In the south,
the Khabarovsk region borders the Heilongjiang province of China. In
the southwest and west, it borders the Amur region; in the northwest
and north, the Republic of Sakha and in the northeast, the Magadan
region. The mountain ranges of Sykgote-Alin, Jzhugzhur, and
Suntar-Khayat occupy the greater part of the territory. The capital
is Khabarovsk (Lat 48o 30'N; Long 135o 5'60"E), with 58 300
inhabitants (2003 census). - Mod.NP]
[Rotavirus infection is ubiquitous throughout the world.
Consequently, in future, ProMED-mail will not routinely post
notification of outbreaks unless precise epidemiological information
is available concerning the characteristics of the strain involved,
or unless there are unusual features relating to virulence, host
range and number of victims involved. At least one vaccine is now at
a late stage of evaluation; see: Rotavirus vaccine, intussusception
(02): active surveillance 20070315.0917. - Mod.CP]
