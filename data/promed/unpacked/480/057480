USA (Nevada): Norovirus Outbreak at High School Volleyball Tournament
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The number of people who say they got sick last week during a high
school volleyball tournament in Reno has now passed 300, and health
officials say they're still no closer to pinpointing a source of the
outbreak. "There are so many possibilities for transmitting this
highly contagious virus, we may never be able to pinpoint where it
started,"said Bob Sack, director for environmental health services of
the Washoe District Health Department.
Since many of the people who got sick were attending the tournament,
officials said it was possible the norovirus infection was brought in
from another city or even another state. "The source could have come
from almost anywhere at this point, including here," said Tracie
Douglas, spokeswoman for the department's environmental division.
"The only fact we have right now is we have [a confirmed norovirus
infection]." Many of the 2160 players in 360 teams from throughout
the West stayed at the Reno Hilton, and they played in the tournament
that ran Thursday through Sunday at the Reno-Sparks Convention
Center. Health officials have said that the virus could have been
spread by any of a number of sources, including the volleyballs used
in the tournament.
Inspectors have said that people who didn't play in the volleyball
tournament or stay at the Reno Hilton have reported symptoms of
norovirus infection. As the health department's search for a virus
cause goes on, the Reno Hilton continues to sanitize all of its 2000
hotel rooms in an attempt to eliminate possible sources of the
illness.
An outbreak in 1996 at the Reno Hilton, northern Nevada's largest
hotel casino, was attributed to norovirus infection.

Multiple Factors Involved in Resistance to Norovirus Infection
-------------------------------------------------
Scientists are learning more about why some individuals appear to be
resistant to norovirus infection and others are not. "Although
noroviruses are highly infectious, volunteer studies have shown that
some subjects remain uninfected even after challenge with high
doses," Dr. Lisa Lindesmith of the University of North Carolina in
Chapel Hill and colleagues explain in an advance [Apr 14 2003] online
publication of Nature Medicine.
They analyzed saliva samples collected from 77 individuals
participating in 2 norovirus volunteer challenge studies. After
challenge with _Norwalk virus_, 44 percent of the volunteers
developed infections. They identified 2 mechanisms of Norwalk virus
resistance: "Innate genetic resistance mediated by inactive
[alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase gene] (FUT2) alleles" and "acquired
immunity characterized by rapid Norwalk virus-specific mucosal IgA
production in some [secretor] Se+ volunteers. Both resistance
mechanisms seemed to provide complete protection at every dose level
studied, suggesting that both mechanisms are dose-independent," they
write.
These findings support the theory that a functional FUT2 gene and
positive secretor status are susceptibility markers for Norwalk virus
infection. However, "Of the susceptible population that encoded a
functional FUT2 gene, a portion was resistant to infection," they
note. This suggests to the team that a "memory immune response or
some other unidentified factor also affords protection against
Norwalk virus infection."
The researchers also found, as have others, that norovirus-like
particles bind more efficiently to O and A antigens than to B-antigen
saliva specimens. Supporting a prior study, group-O individuals were
more susceptible to Norwalk virus infection than group A or B
individuals. They conclude that: "Although additional human challenge
studies with other noroviruses are needed, our data suggest that
norovirus vaccines may elicit protective immunity and reduce the
substantial disease burden associated with these viruses."
