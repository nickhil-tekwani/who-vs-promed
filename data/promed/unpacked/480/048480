Since the beginning of 2013, 3 cases of rabies in humans have been recorded in Ukraine (specifically in the Donetsk, Kharkiv and Kyiv regions), according to the press service of the State Veterinary and Phytosanitary Service of Ukraine.

Every year in Ukraine, about 120 000 to 140 000 people seek medical attention for animal bites, of whom 60 percent are referred for treatment on suspicion of being infected with rabies, according to this report.

Rabies is prevalent in all geographic areas and regions of Ukraine, but a geographical shift has been observed recently. Between 2006 to 2008, the largest number of patients seeking treatment for suspected rabies infection was recorded in the eastern and northeastern regions of Ukraine. But by 2009, rabies treatment requests began to shift to the northwestern regions of Ukraine, namely the Khmelnytsky, Vinnytsia, and Zhytomyr regions. During the period 2010-2012, due to the rapid development of an epizootic of rabies in the adjacent areas, concern shifted to the Ternopil, Kirovohrad, Cherkasy and Odesa regions.

The State Veterinary Service has issued a statement reminding the population that Sat 28 Sep 2013 is World Rabies Day, which aims to increase awareness of the effects of rabies in humans and animals and the problem of preventing disease where control of rabies virus infection in animals is neglected.

[This report lacks any record of the extent of animal rabies in Ukraine or of the reasons for the movement of the epizootic. It is unclear to what extent rabies is present in the domestic animal population relative to domestic livestock. It is not revealed in what manner the 3 rabies cases became infected. Further information would be welcomed clarifying these issues.
