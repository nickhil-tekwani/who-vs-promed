A comment on the moderator's statement that: "It is difficult to comprehend the reluctance of the local population to make use of the free canine vaccination service available in the City."

Philippine humane investigators have told me that there is an active clandestine traffic in backyard-reared dogs for human consumption in Cotabato, and a vaccinated dog is believed to be unsafe for consumption.

A related issue is believed to be behind the reluctance of some of the local animal control contractors to stop using "tambucho gassing," meaning gassing with vehicle exhaust, to kill stray dogs. This has been a public issue at least since 2006.

If the animal control operators use pentobarbital to kill dogs, the remains cannot be sold out the back door to illegally operated dog meat restaurants.

Of course nobody admits to either selling dog carcasses out the back door, or to running dog meat restaurants, or to bribing public officials to look the other way, all of which makes dealing with the rabies problem and related issues more difficult.
