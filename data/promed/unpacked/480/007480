-----------------------------------------------
The newspaper article quoted in the above ProMED-mail message
included a statement that "researchers had detected antibodies to
classical swine fever in wild boar in The Netherlands." To my
knowledge, this is incorrect.

[Dr. Kuiken's clarification falls in line with ProMED-mail's
commentary in the above posting, which indicated that the disease was
eradicated and has reportedly been absent in the Netherlands since
March 1998. - Mod.AS]
