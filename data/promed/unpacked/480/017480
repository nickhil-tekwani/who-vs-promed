The health centers are packed with people, children and adults alike. The reception rooms and hospital rooms are packed. Children (mostly), women and men. Nobody is spared. The symptoms are the same for everyone: high fever, flu, cough, headache, vomiting, fatigue, pain in the joints. It has been almost 3 weeks since the citizens started living this situation, but nobody seems to know what it is. Some call it an epidemic. While some doctors think it is seasonal flu, others refuse to give it a name and refute the idea that it would be an epidemic. As for the treatment, it is ... symptomatic.

Yesterday [22 Nov 2017], at around 10 am, the reception room of the Caritas Comoros Sister Colette health center, was crowded. All the hospital rooms were full. Dr Habraji Mohamady says he and his colleagues have been working hard for 3 weeks.

The cause? "The disease" that rages. But no one can give it a name. Is it "seasonal flu"?, he asks. However, according to him, the Caritas Comoros health center in partnership with the health authorities have taken samples that are sent to the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar and the results of the assessment are still expected.

According to him, the symptoms are the same, fever of 40 deg C [104 deg F], influenza symptoms, cough, headache and pain in the joints." Also according to the doctor, the number of consultations has doubled in this period. "We do 50 to 60 consultations a day, apart from emergency consultations. And the capacity is less than 40 beds. Patients are hospitalized for 3 days." The doctor said the treatment is symptomatic while waiting for the results of the analyses. The doctor advises to take hot drinks, to cover oneself against the dust and the wind, and to take vitamin C.

For his part, the director of the Caritas health center, Said Abdillah, said his service is "saturated" with 12 to 13 hospitalizations on average per day. "We have a capacity of 38 beds that are all occupied daily. Sometimes we send patients away for lack of space. To others, we prescribe treatment and ask them to go home and return the next day."

He adds that the majority of patients are children from 7 months to 8 years old. "The treatment remains symptomatic and the patient is strengthened with vitamin C," he says. [A patient] from Sidjuwu is on his 3rd day in hospital. He has pain, headache, and a sore hip.

For his part, the national head of epidemiological surveillance, Dr Saindou Ben Ali Mbae, said that samples will be taken and sent to Madagascar next [Mon 27 Nov 2017] for analysis. According to him, the disease that plagues the region of the Indian Ocean and from communications he has had with colleagues from the sister island Mayotte, where it is also prevalent, is an influenza type A/H1N1. He calls on the population to strengthen hygiene measures.

[The news report above describes an undiagnosed outbreak in Comoros. The main symptoms are fever (40 deg C/104 deg F), headache, cough, vomiting, fatigue, and joint pains. Although all age groups are affected, the patients are mainly 7 months to 8 years of age. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

The Union of Comoros, with a population of 795 601 residents, is a nation comprised of 3 islands in the Indian Ocean located at the northern end of the Mozambique Channel off the eastern coast of Africa between northeastern Mozambique and northwestern Madagascar; its capital is Moroni, on Grande Comoros (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comoros). Caritas Comoros runs one health center and 12 first aid posts on the 3 islands of the Union of Comoros (https://www.caritas.org/where-caritas-work/africa/comoros/). Maps of Comoros can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_the_Comoros#/media/File:Cn-map.png and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5471334,175. - Mod.ML]

[A diagnosis of influenza A is a likely diagnosis here, although the focus on joint pains makes one wonder about other possible explanations, such as chikungunya. Of note, there was a major outbreak of chikungunya in the Comoros Islands in 2005 -- approximately 12 years ago (see ProMED-mail Chikungunya - Comoros (Ngazidja) 20050405.0986 for details). The mention that the most affected population in this current undiagnosed outbreak is the 7-months to 8-year-old population may well be a reflection of building up a susceptible population for another significant outbreak of chikungunya. It will be interesting to hear the results of the tests on the etiology of this outbreak. - Mod.MPP]

[The clinical presentation of high fever with respiratory symptoms is highly suggestive of a viral illness such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or adenoviruses infections (https://www.cdc.gov/adenovirus/about/symptoms.html). However joint pain is not a common feature but it is reported in arboviral infections (such as chikungunya, as mentioned by Mod.MPP above), involving the small joints of the hands and feet, wrists, elbows, ankles, and knees.

According to the latest WHO influenza update, "In Eastern, Middle and Western Africa, influenza detections continued to be reported, with all seasonal influenza subtypes present in the regions" (http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/latest_update_GIP_surveillance/en/). Laboratory diagnostic results can help confirm whether influenza is indeed the underlying cause or if further investigation is required. - Mod.UBA
