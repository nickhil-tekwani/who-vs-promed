Federal officials have banned imports of Mexican orange juice suspected in
a _Salmonella_ outbreak traced to Sun Orchard Inc.
And a top Maricopa County health official says unpasteurized orange juice
production could resume at the Tempe plant as early as next week.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration found _Salmonella_ in a tanker load
of juice from Citro Tam Sociedad at the Pharr, Texas, port of entry after
the outbreak in late June, FDA spokesman Gil Meza said Thursday.
Blended juice from Mexico has been identified as the source of diarrhea and
vomiting that struck more than 200 people throughout the West, including 32
in Arizona. Sun Orchard officials said it stopped accepting juice from
their Mexican supplier after the outbreak was reported.
Before the outbreak, the FDA border inspection of orange juice included
pesticides but not a test for _Salmonella_ because it was not believed to
be a hazard in a product as acidic as orange juice, Meza said.
Sun Orchard recalled the tainted juice and stopped unpasteurized orange
juice production in Tempe when the first illnesses were reported June 23 in
Seattle.
Then the FDA changed its test procedure at the border.
"They decided to test for _Salmonella_ since the recall was under way,"
Meza said. "Apparently, three shipments tested positive."
The juice was sent back to Mexico and an "import alert" was issued July 16.
The Mexican producer must pass inspection for _Salmonella_ five times
before the juice will be allowed into the United States again, Meza said.
Meza said he did not know when the FDA would complete its investigation of
the outbreak or take any action against Sun Orchard. The firm was exempted
from a federal requirement for warning labels because its methods of
providing unpasteurized juice were considered extremely safe.
Al Brown, Maricopa County Environmental Services director, said that the
plant has been cleaned, and that he is awaiting laboratory results from
samples on the production line to determine when unpasteurized juice can be
shipped from Tempe again.
"It looks like it's going to be next week," Brown said. "We're not waiting
around for the FDA."
Brown said his jurisdiction only extends to products distributed in the
county. But he said the recall begun by Sun Orchard and adopted by the FDA
only applies to the batch of unpasteurized orange juice produced for
consumption by July 7 and half-gallons of "fresh" Sun Orchard margarita mix
with an "enjoy by" date of Aug. 5.
The recalled product has been removed from the market, Brown said.
"The epidemic is over."
