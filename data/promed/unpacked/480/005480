San Diego's ongoing hepatitis A outbreak has now killed 20 people in San Diego and, with the number of cases still on the rise, concern continues that the health emergency could reach new populations. The county Health and Human Services Agency published new weekly totals Tue 31 Oct 2017, which add 1 to the number of deaths recorded since the health crisis started in November 2016. The running tally of confirmed cases also continues to increase, reaching 536 from a previous total of 516.

Dr Eric McDonald, chief of the county's Epidemiology and Immunization Services Branch, said that the latest fatal case was a 67-year-old man who died on 26 Oct 2017. The man, McDonald said, was previously infected with hepatitis A but seemed to recover before symptoms returned. Like most of those who have died during the outbreak, the man had underlying liver problems. It was not clear if he was homeless or an illicit drug user, the populations most affected by the disease along with those who have contact with them. Relapse is a known occurrence with hepatitis A. Medical literature indicates that the virus comes back after appearing to be vanquished in between 3 percent and 20 percent of cases.

Though case totals are growing more slowly than they were over the summer, the county health department remains concerned that the outbreak could spread to gay men. Several outbreaks in this population are ongoing in Colorado, New York and Paris but are not connected to San Diego. San Diego public health officials have noted that a large ongoing outbreak in Southeast Michigan, which had been largely contained to drug users, recently showed signs of an increase involving men who are sexually active with men. According to the Detroit Free Press, the Michigan outbreak generated 11 cases among gay men in October 2017, compared with 10 in the preceding 14 months.

McDonald said that there has been no similar escalation in San Diego. So far, he said, 10 of the outbreak's 536 confirmed cases have been among gay men. "Right now we have no evidence of crossover to this community, but it is something that we're continuing to do outreach on. It's something that we want to prevent," McDonald said. He added that the county is working with existing vaccination programs run by San Diego's Family Health Services and The Center, a LGBT outreach nonprofit, to enhance vaccination efforts.

McDonald said the county's recent efforts to vaccinate thousands of food service workers, first responders and others who have direct contact with the public are a big part of the effort to keep the outbreak from reaching a wider demographic group.

While there is concern about hepatitis A infections moving into new communities, there continue to be signs that the pace of new infections is slowing. In recent weeks the number of new cases reported to the county health department has been slower than it was in the summer and late spring. "We were getting 20 to 25 confirmed cases per week, and now we're down to half that," McDonald said. Last week [week of 23 Oct 2017], Dr Wilma Wooten, the county's public health officer, said that the outbreak had produced no new cases from 8-19 Oct 2017. McDonald said that information was a "misstatement." To date, he said, there has not yet been a week without hepatitis A cases being reported to the county health department.

While cases among the homeless and drug users have been getting most of the attention, there has been a steady increase in the number of local food handlers testing positive for hepatitis A infection. On 15 Sep 2017, the county notified the public that a worker at World Famous restaurant in Pacific Beach had tested positive. The news sent hundreds to a special vaccination clinic to receive the hepatitis A vaccine which can help prevent infection if administered within two weeks of exposure. At the time, 7 food-service workers had been infected. Today, 31 Oct 2017, McDonald said, that number has increased to 17. The county has not notified the public of any other food service worker infections.

McDonald said the health department is following a notification protocol created by the CDC. That protocol recommends public notice only if certain factors are present such as lack of sanitation among workers and exposure within a time frame where administration of vaccine could help prevent infection. "The other food handler cases did not meet the criteria that requires public notice," McDonald said.

He added that the infected World Famous worker does not appear to have spread his or her infection to anyone else. The 50-day maximum incubation period for the hepatitis A virus has passed in that case. However, one of the other 16 food handler cases -- one of those that the public has not been notified about -- did cause a secondary case. Currently, McDonald added, three food handlers who are hepatitis A positive are still within the 50-day window where secondary cases could appear.

[Mr Sisson continues to aggressively document many issues regarding the San Diego county outbreak. The county's decision to modify the prevention paradigm for hepatitis A by addressing sanitation as well as strongly recommending immunization of food handlers is appropriate. The next few weeks will show whether these modalities have had a lasting effect on the outbreak. As noted here and above, there appears to be a spillover of HAV cases into the MSM community in Michigan which, to this point, has not seem to have occurred in Southern California. A close analysis of the about 1/3 of cases that have not fallen into the homeless and illicit drug cohorts may further elucidate risk factors such as common restaurants.

Little information in either the California or Michigan outbreaks has been released regarding risk factors in the now 38 deaths occurring in the two outbreaks. It is certainly likely that the deaths occurred in individuals with underlying liver disease such as chronic hepatitis B or C or NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis -- fatty liver). That the death noted above occurred during a "relapse" of HAV is interesting. A 2012 paper describes what the authors call "endogenous reinfection" related to IgA anti-HAV antibodies:

Dotzauer A, Heitmann A, Laue T, et al: The role of immunoglobulin A in prolonged and relapsing hepatitis A virus infections. J Gen Virol. 2012; 93(Pt 4): 754-60. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.038406-0

Abstract
--------
"Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infections result in different courses of the disease, varying between normal, prolonged and relapsing. However, the reason for these heterogeneous clinical appearances is not understood. As HAV-anti-HAV IgA immunocomplexes (HAV-IgA) infect hepatocytes, IgA was postulated as a carrier supporting hepatotropic transport of HAV, and it was speculated that this carrier mechanism contributes to the various clinical outcomes. In this study, the IgA-carrier mechanism was investigated in a mouse model. We show that HAV-IgA immunocomplexes efficiently reached the liver not only in HAV-seronegative mice, but also, and this is in contrast to free-HAV particles, in immunized HAV-seropositive animals. This IgA-mediated transport of HAV to the liver in the presence of immunity depended on the stage of development of the immune response. We conclude that over a period of several weeks after infection, anti-HAV IgA is able to promote an enterohepatic cycling of HAV, resulting in continuous endogenous reinfections of the liver. Our experiments indicate that highly avid IgG antibodies, which are present at later times of the infection, can terminate the reinfections. However, the endogenous reinfections in the presence of a developing neutralizing immunity might contribute to prolonged as well as to relapsing courses of HAV infections. Furthermore, the results show that serum IgA may act as an infection protracting factor." - Mod.LL

[2] Michigan: HAV Emergency Plan

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services [MDHHS] is activating an emergency plan in response an outbreak of hepatitis A. The number of cases continues to rise in Michigan. The department is activating what is called the Community Health Emergency Coordination Center.

"To help coordinate Michigan's response to the hepatitis A outbreak, we are opening the Community Health Emergency Coordination Center to assist the multiple local public health jurisdictions involved in the response and prevention of further cases," said MDHHS Director Nick Lyon.

The emergency coordination center will provide support to health departments, hospitals, EMS and other health care providers. Health care providers are asked to encourage hepatitis A vaccination.

"We know that the hepatitis A vaccine is more than 90 percent effective in protecting someone who may be exposed to hepatitis A," said Dr Eden Wells, Chief Medical Executive with the MDHHS. "Without a single source associated with these cases, the importance of vaccination and proper hygiene is vital to ensuring we stop the person-to-person spread of hepatitis A."

There have been 457 confirmed cases of hepatitis A since 1 Aug 2016. This number includes 18 fatalities associated with the outbreak and affected a number of cities; City of Detroit, Huron, Ingham, Lapeer, Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, Sanilac, St Clair, Washtenaw, and Wayne Counties reported to MDHHS.

To reduce the risk of contracting hepatitis A, health officials recommend the following points of emphasis:
- Wash hands frequently, especially after using the bathroom, changing diapers, and before preparing and eating food.
- Clean and disinfect all surface areas if someone in the household or workplace has symptoms., especially areas such as toilets. sinks, trashcans, doorknobs and faucet handles.
- Do not prepare food if you have symptoms and refrain from food preparation for at least 3 days after symptoms have ended, or two weeks after onset of clinical symptoms, whichever is longer.
- Get the Hepatitis A vaccine.

[With more than 450 cases and 18 deaths over more than a year and no sign of lessening of the outbreak in southeastern Michigan, such an emergency declaration seems overdue. Approaching the outbreak, as San Diego county has done, by adapting the prevention paradigm to address sanitation and strongly recommending immunization of food handlers may have an effect, but it is not clear that those modalities are to be considered. Again, unlike San Diego, the outbreak here, which was more prevalent in drug abusers, seems now to have had increased spillover into the MSM population. It is not clear that the issues with lead in Flint's water and the cluster of legionellosis possibly linked to contaminated water (Legionellosis - USA (02): (MI) genotyping, RFI Archive Number: 20170217.4846471), which has now resulted in legal action against some officials, may have diverted attention from the HAV outbreak. - Mod.LL]

Two cases of hepatitis A have been verified in connection with Detroit [food] service employees at a Little Caesars Pizza store and Firewater Bar and Grill, according to Detroit health officials. "The Detroit Health Department is conducting a thorough investigation of both establishments to ensure appropriate food handing and cleaning protocols are being followed," says a statement issued [Mon 30 Oct 2017]. "The Detroit Health Department has notified both establishments that infected employees are not to return to work until approved by their doctor."

The Little Caesars is located at 12712 Fenkell, and Firewater Bar and Grill at 6521 John R. "Those who patronized Firewater Bar and Grill from 15 Oct 2017 through 24 Oct 2017, or consumed food from Little Caesars Pizza at 12712 Fenkell in Detroit from 15 Oct 2017 through 26 Oct 2017 should consult their primary care provider to receive the hepatitis A vaccine as early as possible, and before 7 Nov 2017," Detroit health officials said.

The city is offering free hepatitis A vaccinations this week, on [Tue 31 Oct, Thu 2 Nov, and Fri 3 Nov 2017], from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and [Wed 1 Nov 20178], from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Samaritan Center, 5555 Conner in Detroit; and the Family Place, 8726 Woodward in Detroit.

The number of hepatitis A cases in Southeast Michigan has continued to rise as the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services investigates possible sources of the outbreak.

Detroit health officials say there is a "low" risk of transmission by a food handler.

[In the past, unless there have been secondary cases of hepatitis A related to the infected food handler, I have avoided posting such cases but, especially in outbreak settings such as San Diego and southeast Michigan, the infected food handler may become a significant factor in feeding the outbreaks. The cases reported relate to overt clinical cases usually with jaundice in the food handler but even in adults, many cases of acute HAV infection are totally subclinical (no symptoms at all) or anicteric (nonspecific symptoms without jaundice) and these episodes are not found. Healthcare workers are required to be immunized against a variety of infections in part to protect the patients. Consideration of requiring HAV immunization in all food handlers has occurred in the past, perhaps now would be the time to reconsider. - Mod.LL
