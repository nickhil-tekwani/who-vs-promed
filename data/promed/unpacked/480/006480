Cheboygan County deer tests positive for TB
-------------------------------------------
The Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DNRE) has
confirmed a deer in Cheboygan County has tested positive for
tuberculosis (TB).

A 3-and-a-half-year-old doe shot by U.S. Department Agriculture of
Wildlife Services in mid-January [2010] at a private livestock farm
near the eastern Cheboygan County line near Presque Isle County
tested positive for the disease. The department officers were working
under a disease control permit, issued by the DNRE to minimize the
amount of bovine tuberculosis occurring in the area.

"The (tuberculosis) was identified in a single abscess in one of the
lymph nodes in (the deer's) head," said Mary Dettloff, public
information officer for the DNRE.

The deer tested positive on 16 Feb 2010 at the DNRE wildlife disease
lab in Lansing and was sent out for a final culture test which on 8
Apr 2010 confirmed the positive test. The DNRE will conduct testing
on at least 300 deer in a 10 mile radius around where the deer was
found. Continued testing will go on for 5 years after the last
tuberculosis-positive deer is found.

Due to the large amount of public land in the vicinity of the eastern
Cheboygan County area, Dettloff said, the DNRE will be relying on
assistance from hunters next fall.

"We're going to really need deer hunters to help in the fall, if they
are successful in that area, to turn their deer heads in for
testing," Dettloff said.

The DNRE will provide check stations in the area during the season to
assist in the process.

In March [2010], a cow from a cattle herd in Emmet County was found
to be positive for bovine tuberculosis, resulting in testing for all
the cattle in a 10 mile circle of the infected farm. The DNRE is
still in the process of gathering information about the case.

A public meeting to discuss the cattle population will take place at
7 p.m., 21 Apr 2010, at the West Traverse Township Hall, located at
8000 M-119 in Harbor Springs, Michigan.
