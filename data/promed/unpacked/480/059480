A surge in the contagious 'hand, foot and mouth disease' (HFMD) among children is keeping doctors busy at the private hospitals in Oman. Dr A Parthasarathi, specialist paediatrician and neonatologist at the Badr Al Samaa Hospital, said the virus is spreading in Oman. "We are currently seeing around 10 to 12 cases in our outpatient department every day," he revealed.

Dr Santosh Ramaswamy, paediatrician at the Atlas Medical Hospital, said the disease is characterised by a mild fever, painful sores in the mouth and rashes with blisters on hands and feet. "It comes in specific areas where sores may be painful," he stated. Ramaswamy also said the virus is easily spread through coughing and sneezing, and often the disease breaks out within a community. "Initially, your child may feel tired, get a sore throat, or have a mild fever. Then, sores or blisters may appear in the mouth, feet, and sometimes the buttocks," doctors said.

Since most HFMD symptoms resemble those of chickenpox, another contagious viral infection, many parents can be easily misled, warned experts. "Although this disease runs its course without requiring any treatment, it is important for parents to still visit a paediatrician," doctors said.

In case of chickenpox, children develop rashes, mainly on the body near the abdomen areas and head. "The blisters look different from those in the case of HFMD," Ramaswamy said. Though hand-foot-and-mouth disease is common among children, it can also occur in adults during periods when the weather is changing.

Cases of chicken pox and scarlet fever have also been reported in various parts of the country. "The infections and fever are common, as winter is setting in. The number of people taking to bed will keep increasing whenever there is a gap between maximum and minimum temperatures," doctors said. "The best thing to do this season is to practice good hygiene and wash hands regularly, as a good hand wash will kill the virus," they added.

The Indian School Jaalan Bani Bu Ali had to recently declare a 10-day holiday for 1 class after more than 15 students in 1 particular grade had contracted chicken pox.

[The following has been mostly extracted from the comments of moderator Craig Pringle in prior ProMED-mail posts on this subject:

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is caused by a group of RNA viruses called enteroviruses that includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of HFMD in the United States, but other coxsackieviruses can also cause the illness. Only rarely is the precise agent identified because the outcome of infection is generally benign. However, enterovirus 71 has been associated with more severe disease, such as encephalitis.

HFMD is characterized by fever, malaise, painful sores in the mouth and a rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, as well as a rash around the mouth, over the knees, and on the buttocks or genital area. Pictures of the oral and skin lesions can be found at http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2013;volume=79;issue=2;spage=165;epage=175;aulast=Sarma. Temporary fingernail and toenail loss, called onychomadesis, have been reported, occurring mostly in children within a few weeks after having HFMD.

HFMD is commonly spread via the fecal-oral route, blister fluid, and respiratory secretions. Generally, a person with HFMD is most contagious during the 1st week of illness. People can sometimes be contagious for days or weeks after symptoms go away. Some people, especially adults, may not develop any symptoms, but they can still spread the virus to others. This is why susceptible individuals should always try to maintain good hygiene to reduce exposure to any of the enteroviruses associated with HFMD. HFMD is not transmitted to or from pets or other animals. There is no specific vector.

Regarding grading of HFMD, from the Academia website:
"Grade 1 is uncomplicated fever along with rash on the hands, feet and mouth; grade 2 shows twitching in the ﬁngers indicating nervous system afﬂiction. In Grade 3 disease manifests with more serious symptoms: persistent fever, lethargy, irritability, limb weakness, meningism, and seizure. Grade 4 is the most serious level of disease, presenting with cardiorespiratory compromise. Grading is useful for deciding treatment options: child presenting with grade 2 should be hospitalized and carefully observed for further progression. At grade 3 and 4, the child's life is seriously at risk, and intensive care becomes a necessity."
