At least 32 people in the US have been sickened by _Listeria_-tainted caramel apples -- including 6 who have died -- even as firms nationwide continue to recall the treats sold this fall, health officials said Wednesday [31 Dec 2014].

Officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] updated their figures in the growing outbreak, reporting that 31 of 32 victims have been hospitalized in 11 states. In addition, 2 cases related to the outbreak have been reported by the Public Health Agency of Canada.

Of the 6 deaths tied to the outbreak, all of the victims were confirmed to be infected with the outbreak strain of bacteria, but [listeriosis] contributed directly to only 3 of the deaths. It's unclear whether [listeriosis] contributed to 2 others, and 1 death wasn't related to the infection, health officials said.

The CDC continues to warn consumers not to eat any prepackaged caramel apples while the investigation into the [listeriosis] outbreak continues. That includes plain caramel apples and those decorated with nuts, sprinkles or chocolate.

3 firms have issued voluntary recalls for commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples in connection with the outbreak that led to illnesses reported from [17 Oct to 11 Dec 2014]. Happy Apples of Washington, Missouri, issued a recall on [24 Dec 2014] for packaged apples sold at grocery stores, discount stores and club stores in more than 30 states. California Snack Foods of South El Monte, California, issued a recall [27 Dec 2014], for all styles of its Karm'l Dapples products sold in Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas and Utah. And Merb's Candies of St. Louis, Missouri, issued a recall of its Bionic Apples and Double Dipped Apples sold in St. Louis stores and by mail order nationwide.

All of the retailers said they were issuing recalls after learning that Bidart Bros., a Bakersfield, California, apple producer, had voluntarily recalled fresh apples because they may be contaminated with _Listeria_. In a letter to suppliers dated [22 Dec 2014], company president Leonard Bidart said the firm had consulted with the federal Food and Drug Administration [FDA] and California public health officials.

"Out of an abundance of caution tempered by our deep concern for public safety, we are instituting a recall of the processor apples we shipped to you during the 2014 season," the letter said. However, no formal notification of the Bidart recall has been issued by the FDA or the California Department of Public Health.

In the Northwest, the Bidart move forced the recall of about 220 cases of prepackaged caramel apples distributed by Pacific Coast Fruit Company, said Ted Hendryx, executive vice president.

Caramel apples are typically a fall treat and the products should not remain on retail store shelves, health officials said.

_Listeria_ bacteria can cause life-threatening infections in young children, pregnant women, the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. Symptoms can show up weeks or even months after exposure.

The FDA, CDC and state and local officials are investigating an outbreak of listeriosis linked to commercially-produced, prepackaged whole caramel apples. [Listeriosis is caused by the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_.]

According to the CDC, as of [30 Dec 2014], 32 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 11 states. The CDC reports that 31 ill people have been hospitalized. 6 deaths have been reported. Listeriosis contributed to 3 of these deaths and it is unclear whether it contributed to 2 others. The 6th death was unrelated to listeriosis. 10 illnesses were pregnancy-related, with 1 illness resulting in a fetal loss.

The CDC reports that 23 of the 26 ill people interviewed reported eating commercially-produced, prepackaged whole caramel apples. To date, caramel apple brands named in interviews include Happy Apple, Carnival and Merb's Candies. However, the investigation is ongoing and other brands may be identified. No illnesses related to this outbreak have been linked to apples that are not caramel-coated and are not prepackaged, and no illnesses have been linked to caramel candy.

On [18 Dec 2014], the Minnesota Department of Health reported 4 illnesses. The Minnesota cases purchased caramel apples from Cub Foods, Kwik Trip, and Mike's Discount Foods, which carried Carnival brand and Kitchen Cravings brand caramel apples. These 2 brands are no longer available for purchase at retail locations.

3 companies have issued voluntary recalls of caramel apples because they have the potential to be contaminated with _Listeria monocytogenes_. These companies are: Happy Apple Company of Washington, Missouri; California Snack Foods, of El Monte, California; [and] Merb's Candies of St. Louis, Missouri. Each company reported receiving notice from Bidart Bros., an apple supplier headquartered in Bakersfield, California, that there may be a connection between the listeriosis outbreak and the apples supplied to them by Bidart Bros.

The FDA has traced the distribution of the caramel apples eaten by 8 ill people involved in the outbreak. Although the Happy Apple Company and Merb's Candies receive apples from other growers, the FDA's ongoing traceback investigation has confirmed that Bidart Bros. is the only apple grower that supplied apples to both companies.

On [22 Dec 2014], the FDA briefed Bidart Bros. on the status of the investigation. On [22 Dec 2014], Bidart Bros. issued a recall of Granny Smith apples it sold in 2014 to those customers known to produce caramel apples. Then, on [24 Dec 2014], Bidart Bros. notified all customers receiving Granny Smith apples in 2014 to recall those apples if they had been used to make caramel apples.

The FDA is continuing its investigation into whether there are common sources of caramel, caramel ingredients, sticks, or packaging to these caramel apple makers. Additionally, FDA and state investigators are working to identify the source of the contamination and determine what products may be contaminated. New information will be provided as it becomes available.

[The outbreak caused by 2 genotypically distinct strains of _Listeria_ linked to eating caramel apples has now involved 32 cases, including 6 deaths, in 11 US states. In addition, 2 Canadians have also developed listeriosis caused by _Listeria_ with the same genotype as one of the US outbreak strains. No illnesses have been associated with uncoated apples or caramel candy, or with caramel apples that are not prepackaged, according to the CDC. All the companies involved obtained some of their apples from the same apple supplier headquartered in Bakersfield, California (Bidart Bros.). (However, the news reports above do not say if _Listeria_ has been isolated from any Bidart apples.) The FDA is continuing its investigation into whether there are additional common sources of caramel, caramel ingredients, sticks, or packaging material that may be contaminated with _Listeria_.

For a discussion of listeriosis, please see my comments in ProMED-mail post Listeriosis, fatal - USA: (CO) 20110605.1719. - Mod.ML

In July 2014, peaches & plums were recalled from stores nationwide in the USA because of _Listeria_ contamination http://edition.cnn.com/2014/07/22/health/costco-fruit-recall/index.html. The likelihood is that the apples used (from California) were contaminated by soil containing _Listeria_ and not properly washed before caramel was added. _Listeria_ can grow at refrigerator temperatures.
