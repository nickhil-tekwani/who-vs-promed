Tabuk City [in Kalinga province] health authorities are alarmed by the climbing chikungunya-suspect cases that added to the already endemic level in dengue-suspect cases here.

Although most hospitals here are fully occupied with admissions, the City Health Office cannot declare yet if there is an outbreak in Tabuk pending laboratory results from patients' blood samples sent to Manila for confirmation.

City Health Officer Henrietta Bagayao explained that Chikungunya, like dengue, is a mosquito-borne viral infection brought by _Aedes_ mosquitoes. The chikungunya strain is very similar to that of dengue and flu characterized by high fever, skin rashes, vomiting, and joint pains; however, it has no effect on the patient's blood platelets.

Compared to dengue, chikungunya is less fatal, but could lead to further complications if the patient's resistance drops to critical level, Bagayao noted.

Based on the case study of concerned physicians here, the chikungunya syndrome started to manifest in Tabuk as early as May this year [2013], but were reported as cases in the dengue monitoring due to very similar strains.

The CHO warned residents in Tabuk to scale up their efforts against mosquitoes through the Health Department-led drives on clearing of surroundings and elimination of mosquito breeding sites. Patients are also advised to seek immediate medical care to avoid any complications that may cause further problems.

[Although the report indicates that the number of suspected cases of chikungunya virus infection is climbing, there is no mention of the numbers of cases that are occurring. This is doubtless complicated by the simultaneous occurrence of dengue cases in this mixed outbreak. Chikungunya virus infections are characterized by acute joint pain that may persist for weeks or even months, and may incapacitate affected individuals. Interestingly, a mixed dengue/chikungunya virus outbreak has been reported currently going on in Antique province, Philippines (http://www.tempo.com.ph/2013/07/chikungunya-dengue-have-same-symptoms/#.UdWSBDu-2So).
