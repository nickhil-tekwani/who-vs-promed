We are told here that there is evidence that skunks and raccoons are
carrying it [rabies]. There are signs posted in the grocery stores
around the Tennessee/Alabama/Mississippi border region (Pickwick
Lake/Tombigbee waterway area) giving the symptoms for rabies. Signs
say that that if anyone should see an animal displaying it that they
should monitor them while someone calls animal control. If they are
unable to get them and the animal is getting away then they are to
shoot and kill it if able.
No one knows why it keeps turning up with all of the vaccinations
that have taken place. Is there such a thing as an asymptomatic
rabies carrier other than bats?

Concerning the 3 exposures reported, considered to be associated with
the same cat, how was the time interval between exposures? For a
non-veterinarian, it is difficult to judge the many "rules of thumb"
circulating about survival times of infected animals. Would an
observation time of, say, 5 days post-bite be enough to rule out
rabies in the cat, if it survives? Or rule out being infectious at
the time of the bite? This one was killed and found out to be rabid,
in which case there are no [questions]. But imagine those killed and
not found rabid.

[I tried to obtain some up-to-date information on rabies in Tennessee:
CDC Rabies Epidemiology Page
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/rabies/Epidemiology/Epidemiology.htm>
Statistics up to 2001; some data on 2002. Shows TN at risk of skunk
rabies; raccoon rabies is in the Carolinas to the east.
TN Dept of Health ... only an information sheet on rabies, but
<http://www2.state.tn.us/health/CEDS/WebAim/interactive.htm
Communicable & Environmental Disease Statistics: one human case in
2002 (data only available up to 2003)
TN Dept of Agriculture, Animal Health: Not very informative, but
there was an 1 Oct 2005 Newsletter (vol 1, issue 1) posted
<http://www.state.tn.us/agriculture/regulate/animals/newsletter.pdf
So taking advantage of professorial privilege, I contacted an ex-grad
student, Dr. John Dunn, Assistant State Public Health Veterinarian,
TN Dept of Health, for an informed update on the rabies situation in
Tennessee, which follows. - Mod.MHJ]

The Tennessee SHD, East and Northeast Regional Offices conducted
rabies testing and provided consultation following the human
exposures to the rabid cat subsequently reported in ProMED-mail
(Rabies, feline, human exposure - USA (TN) 20060201.0326).
The 2 exposure incidents occurred on consecutive days, 13 and 14 Jan
2006, approximately 3 blocks apart. Testing in the state public
health laboratory indicated that the cat (no vaccination history, no
owner identified) was infected with raccoon variant rabies.
Tennessee has had long-standing bat rabies and endemic terrestrial
skunk rabies. In 2003, raccoon variant rabies was first documented in
northeastern Tennessee as part of the expanding raccoon rabies
epizootic in the eastern US (See 2004 rabies maps,
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/rabies/professional/publications/Surveillance/Surveillance04/RabSlideSet2004.ppt>).
The recent human exposures to the rabid cat highlight a couple of
important aspects of rabies surveillance and control in TN.
Surveillance activities for rabies in southeastern and eastern border
counties, where raccoon rabies is spreading, has been enhanced
through submission of animals to the TN SHD and USDA-Wildlife
Services. Additionally, from 2002 to present, Tennessee has conducted
the Oral Rabies Vaccination (ORV) program in collaboration with CDC
and USDA-WS (<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ws/rabies/orv/dist/tn.html>)
in an effort to control the westward spread of raccoon rabies into
TN. In addition to public health measures targeting animal control,
vaccination of domestic animals, and education of the public
regarding rabies risks and wildlife rabies, expanding the USDA-WS ORV
program will be important in slowing the spread of raccoon rabies
into Tennessee and reducing human rabies exposures.
