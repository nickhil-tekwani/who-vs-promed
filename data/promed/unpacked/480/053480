Novel coronavirus summary and literature update - as of 17 May 2013
-----------------------------------------------
Since April 2012, there have been 40 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with novel coronavirus (nCoV) [note there are presently 41 confirmed cases as mentioned in ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean: Saudi Arabia, new case, RFI 20130518.1721601, earlier today 18 May 2013] - Mod.MPP]. Several countries in the Middle East have been affected, including Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Qatar. Cases have also been reported by 3 countries in Europe: France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. All of the European cases have had a direct or indirect connection to the Middle East. However, in France and the United Kingdom, there has been limited local transmission among close contacts who had not been to the Middle East but had been in contact with a traveler recently returned from the Middle East.

The most recent case reported had onset on 10 May 2013. Most patients are male (79 percent; 31 of 39 cases with sex reported), and range in age from 24 to 94 years (median 56 years). All of the laboratory confirmed cases had respiratory disease as part of the illness, and most had severe acute respiratory disease requiring hospitalization. Reported clinical features include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure requiring hemodialysis, consumptive coagulopathy, and pericarditis. Many patients have also had gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea during the course of their illness. One patient, who was immunocompromised, presented with fever, diarrhea and abdominal pain but had no respiratory symptoms initially; pneumonia was identified incidentally on a radiograph. 20 of the 40 patients have died.

Since [6 Apr 2013], 21 cases of infection have been confirmed and reported in the region of Al-Ahsa in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia (16 males and 5 females, median age 56 years) [22 cases including the newly reported case of today, 18 May 2013 - Mod.MPP]. Nine of these have died, and 6 remain critically ill. Most patients were reported to have at least one comorbidity. The majority of the initial cases were associated with a single health care facility in Al-Ahsa. Additional cases have subsequently been identified who were not patients at the facility. Three family members of cases linked to the facility and 2 health care workers not associated with the Al-Ahsa facility but who had contact with laboratory confirmed cases have become infected. Two additional cases have been identified in the community that did not have any links with other cases from the Al-Ahsa healthcare facility. Although investigations are still ongoing into the source of this outbreak, early information indicated that only a small minority of these cases had contact with animals in the time leading up to their illness.

Since 8 May 2013, 2 cases have been reported by France. The 1st case became ill after a 9-day vacation to Dubai, UAE. The 2nd case, reported on 12 May 2013, is a patient who shared a room at a health care facility with the 1st case. Investigations to look for additional cases among fellow travelers of the 1st case and close contacts of both cases are currently underway, but no further cases have been identified. Of note, the patient's initial nasopharyngeal swab was negative, but a bronchoalveolar lavage was found to be positive for nCoV [newly named MERS-CoV].

All clusters reported to date have occurred among family contacts or in a health care setting. Human-to-human transmission occurred in at least some of these clusters; however, the exact mode of transmission is unknown. So far, no evidence of sustained transmission beyond the clusters into the community has been observed.

Recent peer-reviewed papers published since the last update:
The Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has published a proposed new designation for the novel coronavirus, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Reference: De Groot RJ, et al. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV): Announcement of the Coronavirus Study Group. J Virol. Published ahead of print 15 May 2013. doi:10.1128/JVI.01244-13. [available at: http://jvi.asm.org/content/early/2013/05/08/JVI.01244-13.abstract].

Summary assessment
The nCoV [MERS-CoV] is thought to be of animal origin and to be sporadically transmitted to humans through an as yet unknown route. However, it is clear that the virus can also be transmitted between humans. So far, human-to-human transmission has only been observed in health care facilities and close family contacts, and sustained transmission in the community has not been observed. The continued appearance of cases that are not part of larger clusters, and who do not have a history of animal contact, increases concerns about possible community transmission. This possibility is being investigated by authorities in Saudi Arabia.

The infection of 2 health care workers who had contact with infected patients and other examples of nosocomial transmission re-emphasize the need for meticulous adherence to appropriate infection control measures when nCoV is suspected, beginning with initial patient triage. Current infection control recommendations can be found at: http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/.

The large number of cases with reported co-morbidities suggests that increased susceptibility from underlying medical conditions may play a role in transmission. In addition, it has now been demonstrated that nCoV [MERS-CoV] infection may present atypically, and initially without respiratory symptoms, in immunocompromised individuals.

Limited evidence suggests that the use of nasopharyngeal swabs for diagnosis may not be as sensitive as the use of lower respiratory specimens. Lower respiratory specimens should be used for diagnosis in addition to nasopharyngeal swabs when they are available. If [a] nasopharyngeal swab tests negative, consider retesting using lower respiratory specimens such as sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage. Clinicians should take care to follow strict infection prevention and control guidelines when collecting respiratory specimens of any kind.

The recent increase in cases may in part be related to increased awareness among the medical community; however, the demonstrated ability of this virus to transmit between humans and to cause large outbreaks has increased concerns about the possibility of sustained transmission. Countries in the Middle East in particular should maintain a high level of vigilance and a low threshold for testing of suspect cases. Current surveillance recommendations can be found at:
http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/.

WHO expects that more cases will be identified. Control of the disease will require urgent multisectoral investigations aimed at identifying the source of the virus and the exposures that result in infection. It is critical for member states to report these cases and related information urgently to WHO, as required by the International Health Regulations, to inform effective international alertness, preparedness and response.

[Important points to be highlighted in the above summary include the identification of 2 cases in the Eastern Province in Saudi Arabia that are presently considered to have been community acquired and not directly related to the outbreak in the health care facility. Another key point is the recommendation to use lower respiratory tract specimens rather than nasopharyngeal swabs for laboratory diagnosis of the MERS-CoV infection, an observation that may explain why some earlier contacts of confirmed cases who did have respiratory illnesses temporally consistent with infection, but were milder illnesses and had nasopharyngeal swabs taken that were negative for the MERS-CoV (see prior ProMED-mail report Novel coronavirus - Saudi Arabia (11): clin. lab. & epi. investigations 20121004.1324712).

[2] ECDC Risk Assessment
Date: 17 May 2013

http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/risk-assessment-middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-MERS-CoV-17-may-2013.pdf


Summary:
- As of 14 May 2013, 38 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported worldwide, including 20 deaths. All cases remain associated (including indirect association following secondary person-to-person transmission in the UK and France) with transmission in the Arabian Peninsula and Jordan. The age of cases ranges from 24 to 94 years (N=34 cases), with a mean of 55.5 years and a male/female ratio of 1:0.2.
- The report of 19 new infections in Saudi Arabia in the past 2 weeks -- including one infection with the novel coronavirus [now known as EMC-CoV] acquired in the United Arab Emirates and later imported to Europe -- indicate that there is an ongoing source of infection and risk of transmission to humans in the Arabian Peninsula and Jordan.
- The most recent imported case, which resulted in a nosocomial transmission, originated in the United Arab Emirates and then moved to France. Both patients had underlying conditions and a degree of immunosuppression. One of the transmissions in the UK also affected an immunosuppressed person. These underlying conditions may be increasing vulnerability and the risk of transmission.
- The 1st French case raises the possibility that presentations may not include respiratory symptoms initially, especially in those with immunosuppression or underlying chronic conditions. This needs also to be taken into account when revising case-finding strategies.
- The confirmed infection in France of a patient who shared a hospital room with a patient returning from the United Arab Emirates indicates the risk of nosocomial transmission. This is the 2nd nosocomial transmission in Europe. The 1st one took place when an imported case in the UK visited a relative in the hospital in February 2013.
- These conclusions should be seen in the light of the many uncertainties that still continue with the investigation of cases in the Arabian Peninsula and Jordan. It is unusual to have such a degree of uncertainty at this stage in an outbreak.

Recommendations
- Healthcare workers in the EU should be vigilant in identifying patients that may require further investigation; they should also follow ECDC and national guidance for case finding. Patients developing severe respiratory infections and who have been in the Arabian Peninsula or neighbouring countries in the preceding 10 days should be investigated rapidly. Special attention should be given to medical evacuated patients from the Arabian Peninsula and neighbouring countries.
- Patients with chronic underlying conditions who develop severe infections (not just respiratory infections) should also be investigated rapidly for novel coronavirus if they have been in the Arabian Peninsula or neighbouring countries in the preceding 10 days.
- Since routine microbiological sampling (nasopharyngeal swabs) may give misleading negative results in persons later shown to be infected with the coronavirus, tests should be repeated with deeper respiratory sampling if a person fits into a category that requires investigation, especially if their condition is worsening.
- As demonstrated by a case with dual influenza and novel coronavirus infections, there is a possibility of co-infection, and this should be considered by healthcare personnel. Identification of one causative agent should not exclude testing for novel coronavirus where indicated.
- Mapping of international routes of medical evacuation or emergency medical care from the Arabian Peninsula and neighbouring countries to the EU could be considered in order to determine the most vulnerable centres in the EU where these cases might arrive.
- Companies undertaking medical evacuations from affected areas should be reminded of the risk of transferring infections across borders and of their obligations to protect staff engaged in the transfer; the same holds true for the staff of institutions which receive patients.
- Healthcare workers caring for patients under investigation for MERS-CoV should exercise standard infection control measures following national or international guidance.
- Close contacts of confirmed cases must be monitored for symptoms for 10 days after the last exposure, and should be tested, and should be informed what to do should they become ill. This should be carried out according to guidance, such as that developed by Public Health England UK (See "Sources of additional information" below).
- Healthcare workers caring for confirmed cases should be monitored for early symptoms of infection and advised to seek testing and thereafter self-isolate if they become unwell.
- Clusters of severe acute respiratory infections in the community or in healthcare settings, either among patients or healthcare workers, should always be reported rapidly and investigated for a range of pathogens, regardless of where in the world these infections occur.
- ECDC does not currently consider a need for testing individual patients with unexplained pneumonias or other respiratory symptoms unless they fall under one of the above categories.
- Any probable or confirmed case being diagnosed in the EU/EEA should be reported to national authorities through the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) and to WHO under the International Health Regulations (2005). Reporting through EWRS qualifies as IHR notification and avoids double reporting. Patients still under investigation do not need to be reported internationally before confirmation, but information on outcomes of such testing exercises should be shared with ECDC.
- ECDC supports the WHO travel advice which imposes no travel or trade restrictions in relation to novel coronaviruses. However, EU citizens travelling to the Arabian Peninsula and neighbouring countries need to be aware of the presence of MERS-CoV in this geographical area and of the small risk of infection. Member States may consider active information efforts for travellers to areas most at risk.
- Although the reservoir of infection in the Middle East is unknown, other novel coronaviruses are zoonoses and have come from animal sources. Travellers should, therefore, follow standard good hygiene practices and avoid contact with animals or their waste products.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka

[For those readers who are interested in an excellent review of the current state of knowledge on the epidemiology and laboratory aspects of the MERS-CoV, reading the full report of the ECDC risk assessment, available at http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/risk-assessment-middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-MERS-CoV-17-may-2013.pdf is highly recommended. There is an excellent epicurve by month of onset available on page 5 of the report, along with a mapping of cases by location of presumed exposure in the Arabian Peninsula available on page 6.

Reviewing the epicurves, this moderator is very much struck by the similarities with the initial stages of the SARS outbreak in 2002/2003. In the early stages, the cases appeared to be sporadic, until amplification in the healthcare setting occurred. One difference in the epicurves is seen in the X-axis. In the SARS outbreak, the epicurve was plotted by week of onset, whereas in the MERS-CoV, the plotting is by month of onset, probably related to the absence of information on exact dates of onset of many of the earlier confirmed cases.

The concerns raised in the above risk assessment for Europe are similar to those that would be raised elsewhere: concerns of importations of cases either through apparently healthy travellers (at the time of crossing international borders) and/or those of ill travellers seeking medical care outside of the country where the illness began. - Mod.MPP]

Date: 18 May 2013
Source: CTV News / Canadian Press [edited]
http://www.ctvnews.ca/health/who-warns-saudi-coronavirus-may-be-spreading-seeks-urgent-search-for-source-1.1287364#ixzz2TeiGnbft


The World Health Organization has issued a blunt assessment of the coronavirus outbreak in Saudi Arabia, acknowledging for the 1st time that there are concerns the virus may be spreading from person to person, at least in a limited way.

The statement called for urgent investigations to find the source of the virus and how it is infecting people. And it reminded countries they have a duty to the international community to rapidly report cases and related information to the WHO.

The worrying appraisal of the situation was echoed in a revised risk assessment issued Friday [17 May 2013, see below] by the European Centre for Disease Control. It warned hospitals in Europe to be on the lookout for coronavirus cases coming in by air ambulance, saying the numbers of such patients may rise if the public in affected countries are afraid to seek care in their own hospitals.

The warnings come as health leaders from around the world are gathering in Geneva for the World Health Assembly, the annual general meeting of the WHO. The 8-day meeting begins Monday [20 May 2013].

Though other nations have not publicly pressed leaders of coronavirus-affected countries for more transparency to date, it is likely that concerns about the virus and the opaque way investigations into it are being handled will be aired during the meeting.

"There is no formal agenda for novel coronavirus, but I would be surprised if it didn't come up," WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said in an interview.

Saudi Arabia, after all, is the home of Mecca. The holy site draws roughly 3 million Muslims from around the world every year to the Hajj, a mass pilgrimage Muslims are meant to perform at least once in their lifetimes. As well, nearly one million international tourists travel to Mecca during Ramadan -- the Muslim month of fasting -- to take part in another pilgrimage called Umrah.

Ramadan starts in the 2nd week of July this year [2013]. And the 2013 Hajj will take place in mid-October [2013], only 5 months from now. Experts watching the coronavirus situation are already worried about the potential for spread of the new virus, both within Saudi Arabia and internationally.

"I don't think anyone necessarily knows for certain what is or isn't happening," said Dr. Kamran Khan, an infectious diseases specialist at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. In his research, Khan tracks global travel patterns as a tool to predict and interpret spread of diseases.

"I'm not sure that there's an easy way to get at this information unless it's more forthcoming from within Saudi Arabia or any of the partners that are working with Saudi Arabia inside the country."

To date, the WHO has been notified of 40 confirmed infections with the virus [see ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean: Saudi Arabia, new case, RFI 20130518.1721601 for a report on the 41st case reported earlier today (18 May 2013). - Mod.MPP], which has been recently named MERS, for Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Of those cases, 20 have been fatal.

The bulk of the infections have occurred in Saudi Arabia, which is investigating a large and potentially ongoing outbreak in the eastern part of the country, near the Persian Gulf.

In its statement, the WHO said 2 of the cases in that outbreak have no links to either other coronavirus patients or a hospital where some transmission is known to have occurred. These unconnected cases suggest 2 possibilities. They could have contracted the virus from its as-yet unidentified reservoir, which is thought to be one or more animal species. Or these cases could be a signal that undetected human transmission is happening there.

"The continued appearance of cases that are not part of larger clusters, and who do not have a history of animal contact, increases concerns about possible community transmission. This possibility is being investigated by authorities in Saudi Arabia," the WHO statement revealed.

Other countries that have reported cases are Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Germany, Britain and France. But the infections in the European countries all had their origins in the countries on the Arabian Peninsula.

The statements from the WHO and the ECDC both underscored how little the world has learned about the new virus since its existence was 1st publicly announced last September [2012; see ProMED-mail post Novel coronavirus - Saudi Arabia: human isolate 20120920.1302733 for the 1st public announcement. - Mod.MPP].

"It is unusual to have such a degree of uncertainty at this stage in an outbreak," the European health agency's statement noted. It called the information that has been shared about the cases, including the current Saudi outbreak, "insufficient."

Illustrating the problem, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health changed the count on its coronavirus website on Friday [17 May 2013], adding another case, which brings the global total to 41. The ministry revealed only that an infected person had been found in the eastern region and was receiving care.

The ECDC statement also said that at this point, it cannot exclude the possibility that the virus is acting in a SARS-like manner, especially given that outbreaks in hospitals have now occurred in several instances.

Hospitals played a key amplifying role during the 2003 SARS outbreak, with undetected cases infecting other patients, visitors and health-care workers. The MERS virus is from the same family as the SARS virus.

The criticisms and concerns embedded in the 2 statements might appear mild, but in the world of public health diplomacy, they are unusually frank.

One expert called the WHO statement a shot across the bow for the countries that have been the sources of MERS infections.

"When you see those words, you realize that this is not being handled," said Michael Osterholm, director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.

"The WHO statement and the ECDC's, both, they're really important statements." But even at that, Osterholm fears the time for carefully worded warnings may be running out.

"You've got to kind of call the code," he said. "Either there is going to be an intensive effort made to understand what's going on in the Middle East and appropriate control measures brought to bear, or potentially we're going to be asking a lot of questions one day as to why we didn't do more."

Neither the WHO nor the ECDC is currently calling for the type of travel advisory the WHO levied on Toronto during the SARS outbreak. At the height of SARS, the WHO urged world travellers to stay away from afflicted areas, including Toronto.

But the ECDC said European travellers to the Arabian Peninsula and surrounding countries should be informed of the infection risk. And companies that operate medical evacuations should be reminded of their responsibility to try to prevent transmission of infections across borders.

It suggested that mapping the medical evacuation routes from that region would help to identify which centres in Europe might be at greatest risk of receiving unidentified coronavirus cases.

[New information contained in the above documents includes the 1st good epicurve and mapping of reported cases thus far (in the ECDC risk assessment document) and the mention by WHO that 2 of the cases of MERS-CoV associated illness in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia did not have a history of exposure related to the ongoing nosocomial outbreak associated with a single health care facility (HCF) in the province. Specific information on these non-HCF cases was not provided in the above documents.

The newswire report raises the potential concerns about upcoming pilgrimages to Saudi Arabia, the Umrah during Ramadan, (approximately 10 Jul 2013 - 10 Aug 2013, and involves approximately one million incoming pilgrims from around the world) and the Hajj (13 Oct 2013 - 18 Nov 2013, although 1st date for arrival of pilgrims in Saudi Arabia begins on 7 Sep 2013, and involves approximately 3 million incoming pilgrims from around the world http://dobuy.co.uk/cbhuk/?p=3462). For the map of Saudi Arabia, showing the location of Mecca, see http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mecca,_Saudi_Arabia_locator_map.png.

If one looks closely at the map of confirmed MERS-CoV cases in the middle east, one sees that where location of exposure is known, the cases occurred in the eastern regions of the Saudi Arabian Peninsula, including Riyadh, and the Eastern Province in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the UAE (Dubai and Abu Dhabi) and Qatar. Working under the presumption of a non-human animal intermediate host, this mapping suggests this intermediate host is more likely found in the eastern portion of the Saudi Arabian peninsula.

As is well stated in all 3 of the above reports (the WHO, ECDC and the newswire reports), more information on the findings of epidemiologic, laboratory, and environmental investigations of these cases is eagerly awaited. - Mod.MPP]
