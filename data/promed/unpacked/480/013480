1st report of rust caused by _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ on soybean in
Democratic Republic of Congo
---------------------------------------------------------------
Nigeria (1) and Uganda (3) are the closest countries to the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) where soybean rust caused by _Phakopsora
pachyrhizi_ has been reported. In February 2007, during a disease survey in
DRC, soybean (_Glycine max_) leaves with rust symptoms (tan, angular
lesions with erumpent sori exuding urediniospores) were observed in 10
fields in the following areas in Bas Congo Province: Bangu, Kimpese,
Kolo-Fuma, Lukala, Mbanza-Ngungu, Mpalukide, Mvuazi, and Ntemo. Rust
incidence in these fields ranged from 85 to 100 per cent, while severity
ranged between 3 and 35 per cent of the leaf area on infected plants.
Urediniospores were hyaline [transparent], minutely echinulate [set with
small spines], and 23 to 31 by 16 to 20 micrometers. Within a week of
collection, infected leaf samples were sent to the USDA-ARS [USA Department
of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service] Foreign Disease-Weed Science
Research Unit (FDWSRU) for pathogen identification. DNA was extracted from
sections of leaves containing sori, and all 10 field samples amplified in a
real-time fluorescent PCR [polymerase chain reaction] with _P.
pachyrhizi_-specific primers (2).
Infected leaves of cultivar Vuangi collected from one field each in the
INERA [Institut de l'Environnement et Recherches Agricoles] Research
Station, Kimpese-Crawford, and Kimpese-Ceco were separately washed in
sterile water to collect urediniospores that were used to separately
inoculate 3 detached leaves of susceptible cultivar TGx 1485-1D (4).
Lesions on inoculated leaves developed 5 days after inoculation (DAI), and
pustules (110 to 130 micrometers) formed 7 DAI and erupted 2 days later
exuding columns of urediniospores similar in size to the initially
collected isolates. Inoculation of another set of detached leaves with a
spore suspension from the 1st set of detached leaves resulted in typical
rust symptoms.
Seedlings of cultivar Williams also showed typical rust symptoms when
inoculated separately with urediniospores collected from 9 fields (that is,
all except Kimpese-Ceco, which was infective in the detached leaf assay).
Inoculation and incubation were carried out at the FDWSRU Plant Pathogen
Containment Facility at Fort Detrick [Maryland, USA] as described earlier (2).
The PCR assay, morphological characters of the isolates, and pathogenicity
tests demonstrate that _P. pachyrhizi_ occurs in DRC. To our knowledge,
this is the 1st report of _P. pachyrhizi_ infecting soybean in DRC.

[The fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ was identified in Japan in 1902 as the
cause of soybean rust. It was 1st confirmed on the African continent on
soybean in central Uganda in 1996, although several unsubstantiated reports
suggest an earlier presence on other legumes. The fungus can cause
premature defoliation, with yield losses of up to 80 per cent reported in
Asia. It is now widespread in Australasia and parts of Africa and has
recently been reported from a number of countries in the Americas, but data
are lacking concerning its establishment in Europe. It has a wide host
range unusual for rust fungi, and besides soybean, a number of other
species in the family of _Fabaceae_ can also be affected. Weed species can
serve as pathogen reservoirs, and spores are spread by wind over long
distances. Fungicides may be used in disease management and partially
resistant soybean lines are available.
A less virulent related species (_P. meibomiae_) is found in South America
and the Caribbean and causes rust symptoms on a similar range of hosts.
Previously, these 2 species were considered strains of the same species,
with _P. pachyrhizi_ called the very aggressive Asian strain, and _P.
meibomiae_ called the mild American strain. New strains of _P. pachyrhizi_
with increased virulence and fungicide resistances are emerging.
TGx lines are newly developed African soybean cultivars known as Tropical
Glycine cross (TGx). They are able to nodulate with _Brachyrhizobium_ spp.
that are indigenous to African soils.
