ProMED circulated a request for further information through the Epi-Core network, and this is a summary of the various responses we received:

Reconstruction of the history
1. Prior to onset of illness, the family was staying at Bibione, Province of Venice (seaside resort) and on [13 Aug 2017], the girl was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus at the Portogruaro hospital (40 km [approx 28 mi] north of Venice).
2. The family including the girl returned to Trento where they live on [16 Aug 2017] and she was admitted to the hospital for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. She was discharged on [21 Aug 2017].
3. On [16 Aug 2017], 2 children from Burkina Faso with falciparum malaria were admitted to the same children's ward in Trento hospital.
4. Fever was reported in the girl on [28 Aug 2017], the fever then disappeared but returned on [30 Aug 2017] when she was again hospitalized at Trento hospital. Malaria was diagnosed and treatment was started. On [2 Sep 2017] she was air-lifted to the University Hospital in Brescia with a diagnosis of cerebral malaria.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank all of the EpiCore members who responded to the request for more information on this event.

The overlap with the 2 cases from Burkina Faso was 5 days and thus infection would have had to have beeen through direct transmission by blood and not through mosquitoes. If the needle used for blood sugar testing in some manner was shared between the known malaria patients and the young girl who had been hospitalized for diabetes, then nosocomial transmission is a possibility.

An alternative possibility is that the infection occurred from local Italian mosquitoes that had been infected by an asymptomatic gametocyte carrier. This is well known to happen and malaria was endemic in northern Italy in the past especially in the period between both world wars when there was a high prevalence of the disease, but it was _P.vivax_ and not _P. falciparum_. Whether the local mosquitoes (_A. maculipennis_ complex) are capable of transmitting _P. falciparum_ malaria is not known, but the possibility is not excluded.

From infection to the debut of symptoms, the incubation period is usually 7 - 10 days in non-immune individuals. If the hospitalization for the suspected diabetes mellitus in Portogruaro hospital was in fact when she presented with the 1st symptoms of malaria, then she was most likely infected 7 - 10 days previously, however, fever would have been a key presenting symptom.

Thus the key question is when did the 1st symptoms of malaria actually appear -- and the only certain point in the information we presently have is that she was febrile on 28 Aug 2017.

There is a huge variability from the time the symptoms started to the time of death in imported (non-immune) malaria cases. A large study of 22 fatal outcomes of patient with _P. falciparum_ malaria returning to Switzerland (Christen et al. Am J Trop Med Hyg 2006;75:1188-94) reported an average of 8 days with a low of 3 days. Thus if the 1st symptoms of malaria were on 28 Aug 2017, the date of actual infection must have taken place within the 10 prior days.

Does the climate allow development of the malaria parasite in the mosquito? The average temperature for Trento in August 2017 is found here: https://www.accuweather.com/en/it/trento/216357/august-weather/216357.. The average night temperature is only reaching 20 C (approx. 68 F) on 18 Aug 2017, otherwise it was well below 20 C (approx. 68 F) with a low of 13 C (approx. 55 F). In order to allow _P.falciparum_ to develop in mosquitoes, the average night temperature must be 20 C (approx. 68 F) or more for 8 - 10 days. Thus the temperature in Trento in August 2017 excludes the possibility the 2 patients from Burkina Faso infected local mosquitoes, which then infected the patient.

The average temperature for Bibione in August 2017 is found here: https://www.accuweather.com/en/it/bibione/2550920/august-weather/2550920. From 1 Aug 2017 to 20 Aug 2017 the average night temperature was above 20 C [approx. 68 F] except for 2 days (12 and 13 Aug 2017) and thus the _P. falciparum_ parasite had the climatic conditions to develop in the mosquito if local mosquitoes are able to transmit _p. falciparum_ and were infected by a gametocyte carrier.

The risk of reintroducing malaria in Italy was discussed in Romi et al. in 2012 (Romi R et al. Probable autochthonous introduced malaria cases in Italy in 2009-2011 and the risk of local vector-borne transmission. Euro Surveill. 2012 Nov 29;17(48). pii: 20325). In Trento (Province of Trentino) the _Anopheles_ species in _A. maculipennis_ complex is present which is regarded as zoophilic (not preferring humans).

In conclusion, it is a possibility that the girl was infected by mosquitoes during her stay in Bibione, but nosocomial infection in Trento is an alternative explanation. - Mod.EP
