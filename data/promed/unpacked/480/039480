The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has established a 2nd Avian Influenza Control Zone in Ontario to control the movement of animals, products, and equipment within the zone to minimize disease spread. The boundary of this 2nd Avian Influenza Control Zone covers a 10 km [6 mi] radius from the 2nd premises confirmed to be infected with avian influenza. The zone spans across a portion of Oxford County and Waterloo County, Ontario.

All premises having poultry on site located within the 2nd Avian Influenza Control Zone have now been placed under quarantine; however, only the 2nd infected premises has shown any signs of illness. The Agency is monitoring the additional quarantined premises closely for any signs of disease.

The establishment of individual quarantines and the Avian Influenza Control Zone is part of an internationally accepted practice to allow trade to continue from non-infected areas of a country. The establishment of this second zone will continue to contribute to the alleviation of market access restrictions.

Some of our trading partners, including the European Union and the United States, have recognized our 2nd control zone and trade in products originating outside the 2 zones will be able to resume shortly. We are working closely with industry and the remainder of our international partners to reaffirm continued trade based on ongoing effective control measures and certification requirements.

The CFIA has completed scientific testing at the Agency's National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (NCFAD) to sequence the virus of this particular H5N2 strain of avian influenza. This strain of the virus currently present in Ontario is nearly identical to the strain identified at the initial infected premises, as well as in British Columbia at the end of 2014. It also closely matches the strain isolated in Washington State, US. Avian influenza strains circulate in migratory wild birds and waterfowl, which pose a risk for spreading the disease.

Avian influenza does not pose a risk to food safety when poultry and poultry products are properly handled and cooked. Avian influenza rarely affects humans that do not have consistent contact with infected birds.

As the CFIA's investigation progresses, any additional control measures will be assessed and put into place as appropriate. Poultry farmers are reminded to practice a high level of biosecurity to reduce the risk of disease spread, and report any suspicious symptoms in their flocks to the CFIA.

[This virus continues its march. One has to wonder as the wild birds migrate north, and now we are seeing a slight uptick in the cases in Canada, if the wild birds are still not responsible for starting the spread of this virus, and perhaps are partly or wholly responsible for its continuing spread.
