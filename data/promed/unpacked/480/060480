Jose Arturo Velasquez, executive director of Community Health of the Puno Regional Health Directorate, reported that a total of 6 cases of rabies have been recorded so far in 2012 in Puno region.

The official indicated that one of the 6 cases, a person from Macusani, died after being bitten by a dog on the 3rd floor of the Carlos Monge Medrano Hospital in the city of Juliaca [see ProMED-mail posting 20121002.1319488]. Of the 6 cases, 3 were bitten by dogs and the other 2 by a pig and a cow.

In light of these events, a dog vaccination campaign will be carried out on Sun 30 Sep 2012, for which about 23 000 doses [of rabies vaccine] were distributed among the different health networks in the region.

[In ProMED-mail post 20121002.1319488 it was reported that the person referred to above, who bitten by the dog, had stopped his treatment. Stopping post exposure prophylaxis has proven to be an unwise move.

We do occasionally hear of cattle getting the virus. They are also capable of transmitting the virus. One of the most common ways that cattle transmit the virus is because veterinarians, owners, and other animal caretakers believe the animal has something lodged in its throat and reach in to attempt to dislodge it. Cattle have a uniquely peculiar bellow when they are afflicted with this disease. Some people mistake it for something lodged in the throat.

Any mammal, especially warm-blooded mammals are susceptible to rabies. We do not often get reports of pigs with rabies, but they can get the disease and are as capable as any mammal of transmitting the virus.
