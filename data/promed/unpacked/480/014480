[The original email version of this report had 19 currently active cases/infections. This was erroneous and has been changed to the correct total of 22 currently active cases/infections. - Mod.MPP]

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections. - Mod.MPP]

Saudi Arabia
Between [21 Apr 2017] and 29 May 2017, 25 cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported in Saudi Arabia including 6 fatal cases. Twelve of the 25 reported cases during this period were associated with 3 simultaneous yet unrelated clusters of MERS cases. The Ministry of Health is evaluating each case and their contacts and implementing measures to limit further human-to-human transmission. A description of the 3 clusters is below.

Cluster 1
A cluster of cases has been identified at a hospital in Bisha city, Assir Region. Cases associated with this cluster are:

1st identified fatal case: A 71-year-old male reported on 9 May 2017.
Secondary case - Healthcare contact: A 54-year-old male reported to WHO on 13 May 2017.
Secondary case - Healthcare contact: A 57-year-old male reported to WHO on 17 May 2017.

Cluster 2
A cluster of cases has been identified in a hospital in Riyadh city, Riyadh Region. Cases associated with this cluster are:

1st identified fatal case: A 55-year-old male reported to WHO on 14 May 2017.
Secondary case - Healthcare contact: A 33-year-old male reported to WHO on 15 May 2017.
Secondary case - Healthcare contact: A 30-year-old female reported to WHO on 15 May 2017.
Secondary case - Healthcare contact: A 25-year-old female reported to WHO on 16 May 2017.
Secondary case - Healthcare contact: A 38-year-old male reported to WHO on 17 May 2017.

Cluster 3
A 3rd cluster was detected at a hospital in Wadi Aldwaser city, Riyadh region. This outbreak is believed to be over based on the follow-up period of all contacts. The 4 newly identified cases associated with this outbreak are listed below. In total, 5 cases were associated with this outbreak:

1st identified case: A 55-year-old male previously reported to WHO on 19 Apr 2017 (see Disease Outbreak News published on 27 Apr 2017).

Secondary case - Household contact: A 50-year-old male reported to WHO on 21 Apr 2017.
Secondary case - Household contact: A 58-year-old male reported to WHO on 21 Apr 2017.
Secondary case - Healthcare contact: A 31-year-old male reported to WHO on 21 Apr 2017.
Secondary case - Household contact: A 26-year-old male reported to WHO on 26 Apr 2017.

United Arab Emirates
On 16 May 2017, 2 cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported in the United Arab Emirates. Both cases were reported from Al Ain city and both have reported direct links to dromedary camels. The 1st case that was identified, a 69-year-old male farmer, is in critical condition in hospital, and the 2nd case, a 45-year-old male butcher, is asymptomatic and identified during contact tracing of the 1st case. Contact tracing and dromedary investigations are ongoing.

Qatar
On 23 May 2017, one case of MERS-CoV infection was reported in Qatar. The case, a 29-year-old male from Doha, has reported frequent contact with dromedary camels. The Department of Health Protection and Communicable Disease Control in the Ministry of Public Health and animal health resources are currently carrying out case investigation and contact tracing.

Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1980 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 699 related deaths reported.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[According to the above WHO update, as of 29 May 2017, there had been a total of 1980 laboratory confirmed cases of infection with the MERS-CoV reported to WHO, including 699 related deaths (reported case fatality rate of 35.3 percent). During the same period (2012 through 29 May 2017) there were a total of 1614 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 665 deaths reported by Saudi Arabia. Hence, Saudi Arabia represents 81.5 percent of the total number of cases of MERS-CoV infection and 95.1 percent of the total number of deaths attributable to MERS-CoV infection reported to WHO during this period.

All of the cases reported in the above WHO report (including those from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE), have been reported previously in ProMED-mail posts (see references below).

Since 29 May 2017, there have been an additional 18 laboratory confirmed cases and 3 deaths reported by Saudi Arabia, with no additional cases reported by other countries during this same period.

Additional information on the cases listed in the above WHO report include official outcome information from the Saudi MOH website with recoveries reported on cases 3, 7, 10 reported on 30 May 2017, case 4 on 29 May 2017, case 6 on 28 May 2019, case 8 on 24 May 2017, case 9 on 27 May 2017, case 14 on 15 May 2017, cases 17, 22 on 12 May 2017, case 18 on 11 May 2017. case 19 on 19 May 2017, case 21 on 2 May 2017, and case 24 on 9 May 2017.

In addition, case 5 was reported on 5 Jun 2017 as having died.

Additional official outcome information is still pending on cases 1, 2, 24, 25.

While transmission of the MERS-CoV documented in Bisha and Wadi Aldawasir appear to have been interrupted, nosocomial transmission is still continuing in Riyadh as seen in section [1] above. With today's [6 Jun 2017] addition of 2 more nosocomial infections, the tally of cases/infections related to the nosocomial transmission in Riyadh is now up to 16 cases (11 of whom are identified as asymptomatic contacts), with an additional 3 cases identified in Riyadh still under investigation for possible high risk exposures.
