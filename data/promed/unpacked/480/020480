A new case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has been detected in
the western French region of Vendee, the 10th this year and the 59th since
1990, the Agriculture Ministry said Monday.
It was the second case of BSE reported in the Vendee region. The entire
herd of 49 cattle was slaughtered.

A new case of mad cow disease has been discovered in western France. This
is the 10th case this year of cattle found to be suffering from bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the Agriculture Ministry said on Monday.
The case is the 59th to be detected in France -- which has a total cattle
herd of 21 million -- since health authorities began tracking the disease
in 1990.
The animal and the 75 others in its herd, in the Vendee region along the
Atlantic coast, were destroyed during the weekend.
The ministry said the number of fresh cases should disappear after 2001 as
the disease's incubation period is 5 years and all cases could be traced
back to events which took place before late 1996, when tough controls were
slapped on animal feed.
In the second half of 1996, France banned the use of animal nervous tissue,
ground bone and certain organs in feed for pigs and poultry as well as
cattle.

The Dutch Agriculture Ministry said on Saturday it was probing reports that
some compound feed still contained banned animal by-products.
An independent agriculture organization reported that about one third of 62
feed samples it took contained animal by-products, a ministry spokesman
said.
"We are investigating this. If it is true that animal parts are still in
feed, then we will hand it over to the legal authorities," he added.
Animal by-products such as bone meal have been forbidden in compound feed
for about 5 years and in March regulations were further tightened. Most
feed makers were working to comply with the new regulations.
"Some companies, we still don't know how many, are still not doing it and
we will take strong measures against them," the spokesman said. The
practice of feeding cattle meat and bone meal is widely believed to have
been responsible for spreading the BSE (mad cow disease) epidemic in Britain.
The Netherlands has had a handful of BSE cases over the past two years.

[It is interesting that there are two reports of 49 animals and one of the
herd consisting of 75. I wonder which it really is. The spokesman statement
of BSE disappearing by 2001 may be optimistic, especially in light of the
feed incident in the Netherlands. Ultimately, it would appear this disease
is not about to go quietly. - Mod.TG
