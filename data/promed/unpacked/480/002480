Cattle die of unknown disease in Nuwakot
----------------------------------------
Farmers have been worried after an unknown disease killed cattle in
Chauthe and Kumari VDCs of Nuwakot district.

Around 30 cattle in Biruwatar, Dandagau, Phalamechaur of Kumari and
Chauthe, Gaurikharka, Manekharka, Dhunganagau, Kalimare, Dhulepur of
Chauthe VDC die of the unknown disease one after another, said local
resident Janardan Dhungana.

Farmers said the cattle develop symptoms of passivity and ultimately
die within 2 days after suffering from the diseases.

Farmers complained that animal doctors have not reached the affected
areas yet. The site is some 5 hours trek from the district
headquarters of Nuwakot, Bidur.

["Symptoms of passivity" (paresis? paralysis? inappetance?) in cattle
followed by death within 2 days?... This sounds more like a toxic or
metabolic condition; however, following the declared eradication of
rinderpest - undiagnosed mortality in cattle will obtain more
attention by ProMED-mail than in earlier years. A more detailed
description of the observed clinical signs, and results of veterinary
investigation, are requested.
