The Department of Forests Conservation in Ghardaia province has announced that more than 1800 dead birds have been collected since September [2016] to date in the wetland of Lake "Sebkhet El-Melah" ["The salt marsh" or "salt wetland"], located at the southern exit from the capital of the administrative district of El-Menia (275 km or 171 mi south of Ghardaia). [The capital of the Menia district is the Oasis town El Gol√©a; map at http://tinyurl.com/h77zsex].

These birds have been of different species -- most of them being ruddy shelducks, moorhens, marbled teals, and mallard ducks. They were found dead in the lake area "Sebkhet El-Melah", a wetland of international importance as classified in 2004 by the Ramsar Convention [see site no 3, central Algeria, on the map at http://www.ramsar.org/wetland/algeria, zoom-in. - Mod.AS].

Services of the forest conservation and veterinarians in the province of Ghardaia have opened an investigation into the cause of the "mysterious" deaths in the bird population and samples were sent to the regional laboratory of Laghouat and the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Algiers last October [2016], the source said.

The results of the investigation have not been made public yet [but see comment below]. The bird's bodies were buried after liming and sprayed with chlorine by the services of forest conservation. Almost daily surveys are organized by the concerned services at the lake site to detect new mortalities or find clues to the origin of the mysterious death of birds, according to the source.

A warning system for avian influenza and exotic diseases was set up last June [2016] following the flare-up of bird flu in neighboring countries. Surveys were carried out by the veterinary services of Ghardaia and no cases were suspected so far.

According to the news agency "Anatolia", Issa Hammad, a doctor from El-Menia, said: "The Algerian authorities have formed groups of medical doctors, veterinarians, and specialists in epidemiology to work near the epicenter and deal with the crisis generated by the current wild bird flu epizootic, which was discovered a few days ago near the city.

Kadir Muammar, a doctor from the same city, said: "the Ministry of Health announced a contingency plan to contain the outbreak" and added that "the Ministries of Health and Agriculture sent a group of specialists to verify the non-transmission of the disease from migratory birds to domestic birds."

In turn, Taheri Abdel Moneim, head of the Health Assembly, expressed his concern about the situation and said: "We live these days in the region a state of fear that the authorities may have been acting slowly for the detection of the disease." He said that "dead birds have been detected several times since September 2016, including in agricultural sites where farmers and peasants are settled, which means that the risk is still going strong."

[Algeria submitted recently an immediate notification to the OIE on mass mortality in wild birds at the salt marsh south of El-Golea (El-Menia), attributing it to infection by HPAI H7N1 (see 20161103.4605750). Since H7N1 strains have been found, in the past and in other sites, to be primarily of low pathogenicity in wild birds, confirmation of the above serotyping results by a reference laboratory is warranted.

Subscribers are reminded of the recent international spread of HPAI H5N8 in wild, migrating birds, with significant mortalities. See item 3 and commentary in archive no. 20161110.4618279. On top of HPAI H5N8, other possible causes, infectious and otherwise, for the extended mass bird mortality in Algeria deserve to be excluded. - Mod.AS]
