Here is the report by Dr Roger Highfield, in today's (27 February 1998)
Telegraph about yesterday's UK Government announcement re use of blood for
vaccines.

Curb on blood use after CJD fear
By Roger Highfield, Science Editor
VACCINES and other products derived from blood plasma should not be made
from British blood donations as a "precautionary" measure to prevent the
spread of human BSE, the Government said yesterday.
Companies using blood products were told to avoid using UK stocks if
possible to protect patients from the "theoretical risk" of contracting new
variant CJD. Frank Dobson, the Health Secretary, said that there was no
evidence that human BSE could be spread through blood and the measures did
not mean that British blood and blood products were unsafe.
The Government also stressed that no vaccines used on children, such as MMR,
[Note: MMR is the Measles, Mumps and Rubella combined vaccine for children
-- JRB contained UK blood products and that it was still safe to donate
blood, adding that supplies were at a critical level. The action follows
three recalls of blood products last November after donors had developed the
new CJD.
"We must proceed on the principle that it is better to be safe than sorry,"
said Mr Dobson. "If there is even a hypothetical risk and there are
available safe alternative sources of products, then it makes sense to use
them." Blood consists of a fluid, plasma - from which 33 licensed products
such as clotting factors, albumin and immunoglobulins are derived - and
cells, such as platelets and white and red blood cells.
Although transfusions of contaminated whole blood pose the same risk as
receiving contaminated plasma products, many more units of plasma products
are derived from a single donation and so thousands of people could be
affected. The measures were announced after advice from the UK Committee on
Safety of Medicines, which has advised the Government to rely on imported
plasma. But there may not always be a choice, said Prof Mike Rawlins,
chairman of the committee.
Plasma-derived products are used by 100,000 surgical patients each year in
England, 90,000 pregnant women, 90,000 travellers who receive hepatitis
jabs, 80,000 who receive tetanus jabs, 50,000 who use diagnostic products
and 3,400 haemophiliacs.
The blood products that should now be manufactured from imported plasma of
"proven provenance" include a range of coagulation factors; immunoglobulins,
which are used for rabies vaccine, for example; albumin, used to treat
burns; and a stabiliser in some vaccines, such as polio.
Mr Dobson has decided that the NHS Bio Products Laboratory, part of the
National Blood Service, will be allowed to import plasma to manufacture
blood products. The changeover will cost ?35 million. He also announced that
all children under 16 with haemophilia and all new patients can be treated
with the more expensive genetically engineered blood clotting agent, which
is said to be purer than Factor VIII derived from donated blood.
Dr Jeremy Metters, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said the use of imported
plasma was a purely precautionary public health measure. "There is no new
evidence about new variant CJD being transmitted by blood products," he
said. But he added that experimental animal data does (sic) not rule out the
possibility of transmission by blood products".
Dr Sandy Macara, chairman of the British Medical Association, supported the
new measures. "Although the risks are very, very tiny, the public has a
right to be informed and to be reassured that the Department of Health is
taking effective action to secure a safe supply of blood products," he said.
"I urge people who are blood donors to continue to give it in the normal
way. Their blood is still vitally needed. For most clinical purposes, whole
blood is not required. People know that if they need a blood transfusion
they must go ahead because it is a life-saving measure. I am sure that in an
emergency they will put worries about this slight, theoretical risk into
perspective. "For our part, the medical profession must ensure that blood
products are only used when they are strictly
necessary."

End of Telegraph report

My comments:
Having had a life-saving major operation exactly a year ago today, involving
a blood transfusion, I can certainly empathise with that final comment by Dr
Macara.
This development is of course a logical sequel to the report of SEAC from
its meeting of 26 October 1997, consideration by the Advisory Committee on
Microbiological Safety of Blood and Tissues, the subsequent statement by
Frank Dobson on 7 November and the risk assessment that he asked Professor
Swales, the Health Department's R&D Director, to commission. Since the SEAC
report, which referred to "recent research, much of it unpublished" there
have been publication of relevant research reports, which have been noted
here.
I am dubious about the suggestion that there is "safe blood" from any
"proven provenance" source, not only safe as regards CJD but also as regards
HIV, hepatitis, etc , particular in countries where blood is sold. Even
where safeguards nominally exist (USA for example) there is evidence (some
of which I posted some months ago), that there is extensive evasion.
I would suggest that the leuco-depletion of blood supplies, as also
recommended by SEAC, is the more promising path, and now look forward to
publication of the National Blood Authority's programme in that respect,
which Dobson instructed them to carry out.
