The government has constituted a 3-man committee to investigate the quality of foot and mouth disease (FMD) vaccines for animals following media reports about their quality. An official press release said the government had also decided to issue notices to the 3 companies involved in manufacturing and supply of the vaccines.

The committee will be headed by Dr Gaya Prasad, additional director general (AH) of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, and include Dr Ravinder Sharma, director (Research), LLUVAS [University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences], Hisar [Haryana], and Dr B Pattnaik, director, PD-FMD [Project Directorate] as members.

According to the release, the terms of reference of the committee are:
(i) to conduct sterility test on the samples of the same FMD vaccine batches used by National Institute of Animal Health and Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bengaluru. The test will be conducted in the Standardization Division of IVRI [Indian Veterinary Research Institute], Izatnagar [Uttar Pradesh]. Fresh samples will also be drawn from all FMD vaccine manufacturers for testing.
(ii) To examine the protocol followed and competence of staff of NIAH [National Institute of Animal Health], Baghpat [Uttar Pradesh] for conducting FMD vaccine sterility and stability testing and its validity.
(iii) To examine the issue of emulsion stability as per IP [international programs] Vet requirements.
(iv) To examine the issue of use of enrofloxacin antibiotic as preservative in FMD vaccines by M/s. Intervet, Pune.
(v) To investigate the role of Dr BR Singh, acting director, NIAH, Baghpat in leaking test report findings to print and electronic media without approval of the competent authority.
(vi) The Committee will submit its report within 45 days.

[India's annual OIE report provides the following FMD "routine vaccination" (preventive vaccination, as opposed to "vaccination following an outbreak") statistics for 2013 (in brackets, number of animals reported as dead):
Bovine: 15 722 693 (7736),
Buffalo: 3 332 185 (574),
Ovine/caprine: 351 923 (508).

According to the report, 238 outbreaks were recorded during 2013; the 1st semi-annual report for 2014, covering the months Jan-Jun, has not yet been submitted, but according to the media the epizootic has been continuing its spread, causing heavy economical losses and animal suffering.

According to the official press release mentioned above (original available at http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=111247), the committee is to investigate the quality of the vaccines applied.

The FMD epizootic in India has, reportedly, widely spread in spite of the preventively applied vaccination. While the quality of vaccines is obviously of paramount importance, 2 other factors deserve to be addressed if the investigation is expected to be fruitful: the rate of vaccination coverage (= percentage of vaccinated animals within the population at risk) and the matching rate of the selected vaccine strains included in the vaccines applied.

During the last 2 years, the majority of the outbreaks in India were caused by FMDV serotype O. Sequences recovered during 2013 demonstrated the dominance of the "O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d" strain. This strain has also been identified in Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and it spread as far as Libya, Saudi Arabia, and more recently Tunisia and Algeria. According to a recent publication (September 2014, monthly report) of the world reference laboratory for FMD at Pirbright, "in general, 3 vaccine antigens (O/TUR/5/09, O-3039 and O/TAW/98) are matched against [viruses of the lineage "O/ME-SA/Ind2001"] while the in-vitro tests indicate a poorer match for O-Manisa and O-BFS. In view of the threat posed by this lineage, these findings may warrant further studies including in-vivo potency test evaluation against vaccine antigens that might be used to control these outbreaks."

It will be interesting to note which vaccine strains have been included in the Indian vaccines. Even a vaccine of high quality will not (fully) protect in case the strain(s) of which it is composed is/are not matching the field strain.

The Indian investigation will be followed with interest in the Maghreb. According to available information, preventive vaccinations in Tunisia and Algeria were initially performed with vaccines, which included the Manisa and/or O-BFS vaccine strains; the disease spread extensively and is still not definitely controlled.

The said and additional current FMD information has recently been presented and discussed by FMD experts from all parts of the globe in the "EuFMD Open Session", a conference organised in Dubrovnik (Croatia) by the European Commission for FMD (EUFMD) from 29-31 Oct 2014. The conference was attended by 240 participants; its online site has currently 460 registered users.

ProMED-mail subscribers are encouraged to register at https://eufmd.rvc.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=1388. After registering, the Online Conference Manager will grant access to the site usually in a few hours (it is not automatic), and then participants can access
- all presentations as movies,
- download the PPT presentations,
- click to join forums or discussion on any talk,
- start discussion with the presenter through the forums.

There is an amazing set of talks on the site, from speakers from across the world on almost all technical disciplines in FMD control and research. Several papers address the Indian and Maghreb FMD epizootics. The vaccine matching issue is included as well. This site will remain open a few more weeks to cope with demand and ensure access to quality presentations and discussions. - Mod.AS
