FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE IN CHINA (PEOPLE'S REP. OF ~)

----------------------------------------------------
Information received on 26 May 2005 from Mr Jia Youling, Director General,
Veterinary Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing:

End of previous report period: 13 May 2005 (see Disease Information, 18
[19], 125, dated 13 May 2005).

End of this report period: 26 May 2005.

New outbreaks:
Location/ Affected population/ Date of initial detection of lesions or
clinical signs/ Date of laboratory testing results
1. Beijing municipality, Yanqing county/ cows/ 5 May 2005/ 25 May 2005
2. Hebei province, Sanhe city/beef cattle/no clinical signs/25 May 2005
3. Xinjiang Autonomous Region, Hebukesaier county/"yellow cattle"/18 May
2005/26 May 2005

Number of animals in the new outbreaks:
Location of the outbreak/ species/ susceptible/ cases/ deaths/ destroyed/
slaughtered
Yanqing/ bov/ 2464/ 252/ 0 /2464/ 0
Sanhe/ bov/ 512/ 0*/ 0/ 512/ 0
Hebukesaier/ bov/ 308/ 75/ 0/ 308/ 0

* The virus was identified in a serum sample during routine surveillance,
but no clinical signs were observed.

Diagnosis:

A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: national reference laboratory for
foot and mouth disease, Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese
Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

B. Diagnostic tests used: liquid-phase blocking ELISA and RT-PCR.

C. Causal agent: foot and mouth disease virus type Asia 1.

Epidemiology:

A. Source of agent / origin of infection: under investigation.

B. Mode of spread: under investigation.

Control measures during reporting period:

- stamping out;

- ring vaccination;

- quarantine;

- movement control inside the country;

- zoning.

-- ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org> [The identification of FMDV serotype Asia 1 as the causative agent was lacking in our previous posts on these 3 outbreaks. It now emerges that the said serotype has recently infected bovines in at least 3 separate regions, namely Jiangsu and Shandong provinces, in the east and north respectively, as well as the Beijing area. This seems to be indicative of a significant spread of FMDV Asia 1, justifying enhanced, energetic monitoring, animal movement control and other control methods, including mass vaccination. The immunity status of the affected bovines is of interest. Have they been vaccinated prior to the outbreak? If affirmative, what serotypes were included? The outbreak in Sanhe involved a cattle herd where, reportedly, no clinical signs of FMD were observed but "the virus was identified in a serum sample during routine surveillance". This finding led to the destruction of the entire symptomless herd of 512 head. China maintains the largest pig industry in the world. Pigs are highly susceptible to FMD; the Asia 1 serotype is traditionally known to clinically affect pigs. One may assume that surveillance activities are essential and routinely applied in pigs in China. A system which succeeds in detecting infected bovines with such dedication and preciseness, should be able to accurately monitor the disease situation in porcines. Information on such monitoring and surveillance activities and their results would be helpful. - Mod.AS].
