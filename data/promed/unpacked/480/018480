Re: _Southern tomato virus_
-----------------------------
The statement [in the source media report ProMED-mail post 20190523.6483054] that "The virus displays symptoms akin to _Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ or _Pepino mosaic virus_" is inaccurate. STV [_Southern tomato virus_] was initially reported from symptomatic tomatoes in the US, but its link to the symptoms never proven. In several cases where it has been described since that initial report, it was in symptomless plants. As far as I know, there is to date no good demonstration that STV causes symptoms in tomato.

There are at least 3 reports that come from asymptomatic plants. Of course, these could correspond to seedlings from infected seeds. On the other hand, the virus is not mechanically transmissible nor transmissible by grafting. So it would appear to parallel the biology of cryptic viruses. In any case, if the virus is not transmissible otherwise than through seed/pollen, then it is not very relevant whether symptoms are from infected seeds, because there is no other transmission route.

Also, in most cases where STV was discovered associated with symptoms, it was found to be in mixed infection with clearly pathogenic viruses, so that it is not possible to conclude on its pathogenicity: in France with _Tobacco mosaic virus_ and _Potato virus Y_; in Spain with _Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_; in China with _Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_, _Cucumber mosaic virus_, and _Tomato chlorosis virus_.

STV was described [recently] from the United States in tomatoes. It had not been established whether [fruit] discolouration was caused by STV or by other viruses found in the same plants. The authors were unable to transfer the virus by mechanical means or by grafting, nor could they purify it. The virus did not cause any symptoms in seedlings of various cultivars. [STV] was also discovered in France and the Canary Islands, but always in combination with other viruses.

Because STV accompanies the embryo in the seed, it infects tomato lines and varieties as a whole. There are strong indications that the virus itself is not responsible for any tomato disease. But because it is so widespread, it also appears alongside all other tomato viruses. Nothing is known, however, about the possible effects of mixed virus infections or the impact of external stress factors.

STV has probably been present in tomatoes for a long time but was simply never detected. With new techniques we are now finding more and more (new) viruses whose biological significance is often not clear. Cryptic viruses such as STV are common, but we do not know yet what their role or function is. There is growing evidence that cryptic virus can even be beneficial for plants.

[Our grateful thanks are due to Dr Candresse for this most interesting additional information and discussion!

Next-generation sequencing of total host nucleic acids is increasingly providing molecular evidence of virus-like sequences associated with the hosts. However, the presence of such sequences does not automatically prove that they represent a viable, pathogenic virus. Evidence of biological activity, ability to be replicated by the host cell, demonstration of infectivity and/or presence of viable virus particles are required to identify a virus species and distinguish it from remnant, inactive sequences left behind as traces of a pathogen association earlier in the evolutionary process of the host (see also ProMED-mail post 20190528.6490717). These requirements are often much more difficult to fulfill than detection of unusual sequences, because they depend on biological systems that may be influenced by external factors other than the pathogen as well.

Thus, in cases where STV has been reported in tomato plants showing stunting, fruit discolouration, and size reduction, the question is not only if STV alone causes these symptoms, but the following points should also be considered in assessing the potential impact of this virus:
(1) Symptom development may depend on host variety, virus strain, environmental conditions, other external factors, and possible interactions of all of these;
(2) Even visually asymptomatic infections may lead to a significant reduction of plant vigour and yield losses;
(3) Viruses that indeed do not seem to impact their hosts in single infections may still act as synergistic partners in coinfections with one or several other viruses; in such cases, they may either enhance disease development, leading to more severe damage to the host, or act as a protective agent for the host by competing with a disease-causing partner for replication processes in the host cells.

Much more information is needed to assess the role and possible implications of plant cryptoviruses in general and STV in particular, both alone or in combination with other viruses, in diseases and disorders of their hosts. Molecular diagnostic methods are now available to increase our knowledge of biology, epidemiology, and economic significance of this fascinating group of pathogens.
