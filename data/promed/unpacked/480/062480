Hantavirus doctor could be disciplined
----------------------------------
A Texas Panhandle physician could receive disciplinary action for
failing to report a case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome involving
a Castro County farmer.
State law requires physicians to report cases of infectious
diseases to the Texas Department of Health.
In the Castro County case, the doctor who made the hantavirus
diagnosis didn't report the infection because the patient requested
that he not report the case.
According to a report submitted to ProMED, an Internet site for
medical information, the Texas Department of Health reminded the
physician of the statutory requirement to report the hantavirus
case.
Beverly Ray, a nurse epidemiologist with TDH, said failure to report
an infectious disease is a Class B misdemeanor.
"As far as I know no one has ever been charged with failure to
report," Ray said. "There are several other sources that also have
a responsibility to report a case. The hospital where a patient is
treated and the laboratory that conducted any tests."
Jill Wiggins, public information officer at the Texas State Board of
Medical Examiners, said the board could discipline a doctor for
violating a Texas law.
The board's provisions list "committing any act that is in violation of
the laws of the state of Texas if the act is connected with the
physician's practice of medicine," as a possible reason for
disciplining a doctor.
This is the first case of the deadly virus reported in Texas since
October 1997. TDH officials first learned of the case on 8 July
1999 and testing 23 July confirmed the hantavirus infection.
According to health reports, the Castro County man, 51, became
sick in April. He was diagnosed and successfully treated at an
Amarillo hospital in May.
Twelve cases of the disease have been reported in Texas. Of
those, 5 died and 7 survived. One person in Potter County died of
hantavirus infection in April 1996 and one person in Randall County
diagnosed in May 1997 survived the disease.

[It should not need a law & disciplinary action to motivate a
physician, hospital or laboratory to report a case of an emerging
infectious disease such as this.
There seems to be a failure in the basic education of health
workers about public health & prevention. All physicians & health
workers should realise, without having to be told, that although
reporting may be a pain in the anatomy, early warning is essential
to limit spread of any infectious disease, & to alert other health
workers to the appearance of an infection in their community, so
that they can be on the lookout for it & take the appropriate steps.
This is what ProMED tries to do - Mod.JW
