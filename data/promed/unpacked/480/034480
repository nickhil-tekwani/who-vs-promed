By late December 2005, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will
change Minnesota's bovine Tuberculosis (TB) status to Modified Accredited
Advanced. The USDA's move places the state one level below TB Free Status.
There are numerous status levels within the bovine TB eradication program.
The USDA will require that all breeding cattle 18 months of age and older
be tested for bovine TB within 60 days of shipment. Cattle are exempt from
the testing requirement if they are moving interstate directly to
slaughter, a feedlot, or if the animals are from a TB-accredited herd.
Producers shipping animals across the Minnesota border should contact the
state they are shipping to for their import requirements, as they may
differ from the USDA's requirements. At this time, cattle moving within the
state of Minnesota will have no additional testing requirements.
Minnesota's bovine TB investigation continues to make substantial progress.
To date, 42 herds have been quarantined as a result. 32 of these operations
have been removed from quarantine, as testing showed no infection in the
herd. Of the 10 remaining, 4 herds are infected, 3 have been depopulated,
and 6 herds are in the process of completing testing. Counties with
quarantined herds include Roseau, Beltrami, Polk, and Todd.
The Board, along with the USDA Veterinary Services (VS), is offering free
bovine TB testing to any cattle operation located within 15 miles of a
TB-infected herd. Producers located within this testing radius should
contact their local veterinarian or the Board to discuss having their
entire herd tested for bovine TB. The state will pay all veterinary fees.

Thousands of beef cattle are being destroyed in Minnesota as authorities
try to stop the first outbreak of bovine tuberculosis in the northwestern
US state in 34 years.
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is set to strip
Minnesota of its bovine-TB free status, making it the 4th US state bumped
from the roster alongside Michigan, Texas and New Mexico.
Agriculture officials stressed that this is not a human health threat and
so was unlikely to affect trade.
US cattle are routinely checked for TB before they are exported. Minnesota
exports small numbers of live cattle to countries such as China and Cuba,
but generally not to Europe.
The outbreak, with nearly 5000 head of Minnesota cattle destroyed or soon
to be destroyed, comes as US farmers anticipate Japan reopening its borders
to US beef within days, following a mad-cow scare.
Since discovering a case of bovine TB in a cow from Roseau County, near the
Canadian frontier in February 2005, Minnesota officials have moved quickly
to detect and contain the disease, so far quarantining 42 herds. 10 remain
quarantined.
On Wednesday, the last of 3080 head of cattle in 4 herds were destroyed in
Roseau County. Another 1000 head in Beltrami County in northwestern
Minnesota are also set to be destroyed.
Officials say consumers have little risk of catching the respiratory
illness. But farmers will be required to pay for mandatory testing of any
cattle that are to be shipped out of state for breeding or to feedlots.
Now, animal-health officials in a half dozen other states are tracing
exposures that their cattle may have had with tuberculin cattle in
Minnesota. "I don't think tuberculosis is going to be very widespread in
the United States," said Kevin Elfering, director of the dairy and food
inspection division of the Minnesota Agriculture Department. "I think there
are going to be isolated cases."
Meanwhile, consumers have little to worry about, unless they drink
unpasteurized milk, eat under-cooked beef, or rub noses with a cow,
officials said.
In Michigan, white-tailed deer are blamed for an outbreak that cost farmers
an estimated 156 million dollars in lost cattle sales in the past decade.
Regaining TB-free status is not easy for states that have had the disease.
It generally takes 2 years once a state finds no more TB cases to be deemed
disease-free.

[Tuberculosis develops very slowly and is not obvious by looking at the
animal. However, lesions can be detected when the animal is sent for
slaughter. The disease is most often observed in the lungs and/or lymph nodes.
TB can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals. No other
TB organism has as great a host range as bovine TB, which can infect all
warm-blooded vertebrates. The causative agent of TB in animal is
_Mycobacterium bovis_. It can be transmitted by close contact such as
nose-to-nose contact or through nasal/oral secretions. - Mod.TG]
