Britain's honeybees have suffered catastrophic losses this year
[2008], according to a survey of the nation's beekeepers,
contributing to a shortage of honey and putting at risk the
pollination of fruits and vegetables. The survey by the British
Beekeepers' Association (BBKA) revealed that nearly one in 3 of the
UK's 240 000 honeybee hives did not survive this winter and spring
[2008]. The losses are higher than the one in 5 colonies reported
dead earlier this year by the government after 10 percent of hives
had been inspected.

The BBKA president, Tim Lovett, said he was very concerned about the
findings: "Average winter bee losses due to poor weather and disease
vary from between 5 and 10 percent, so a 30 percent loss is deeply
worrying. This spells serious trouble for pollination services and
honey producers."

The National Bee Unit [NBU] has attributed high bee mortality to the
wet summer in 2007 and in the early part of this spring, which
confined bees to their hives. This meant they were unable to forage
for nectar and pollen, and this stress provided the opportunity for
pathogens to build up and spread.

But the BBKA says the causes are unclear. Its initial survey of 600
members revealed a marked north-south divide, with 37 percent bee
losses in the north, compared to 26 percent in the south. "We don't
know why there is a difference and what is behind the high
mortality," said Lovett.

The government recognises that the UK's honeybee hives -- run by 44
000 mostly amateur beekeepers -- contribute around UKL 165 million
[USD 308 million] a year to the economy by pollinating many fruits
and vegetables. "30 percent fewer honeybee colonies could therefore
cost the economy some UKL 50 million [USD 93 million] and put at risk
the government's crusade for the public to eat 5 portions of fresh
fruit and vegetables a day," Lovett warned.

The Honey Association warned last month [July 2008] that English
honey will run out by Christmas [2008], and no more will be available
until summer 2009. It blames the shortage on fewer honeybees and on
farmers devoting more fields to wheat, which has soared in price but
does not produce nectar.

Although British honey only accounts for 10 percent of the 30 000
tons of honey consumed in the UK, other major honey producing
countries have also been severely hit by poor weather and bee
diseases. Argentina is the world's honey pot, producing up to 75 000
tons a year, 3 times that of its nearest rival, Mexico. But Argentina
has suffered a 27 percent drop in yield due to droughts and the
planting of huge swathes of land with soya beans for biofuel. As a
result, there has been a 60 percent rise in the price of raw honey.

DEFRA said a further UKL 90 000 [USD 167 800] had been allocated to
the NBU this year [2008] to expand investigations into colony losses.
It is currently consulting on a honeybee health strategy, with
responses required by the end of this month [August 2008].

In the US, honey yields have been decimated by honeybee loses of 36
percent, many due to colony collapse disorder (CCD), a mysterious
disappearance linked to the blood-sucking varroa mite, lethal
viruses, malnutrition, pesticides, and a lack of genetic diversity.
CCD has spread to Canada, France, Germany and Italy but has not yet
been confirmed by the government in the UK [see ProMED ref. below].

[Note the knock-on effects on bees, fruit, vegetables and honey of
planting more wheat in the UK and more soya in Argentina. UK Farming
minister Lord Rigg has stated that if no solution is found, UK
honeybees will become extinct in a decade. - Mod.JW]

[It is likely the decrease in bees is some form of colony collapse
disorder. As this article notes, there may be multiple causes, or the
causes may be cumulative. Scientists, perhaps with government
funding, would do well to look seriously into this disease and
possible solutions, as pollination for food crops is also at stake
here. - Mod.TG]
