A Winkler [southern Manitoba] mom wants everyone to get vaccinated after her 4-month-old daughter was hospitalized. The infant had her 1st whooping cough vaccination at 2 months of age. A month later, she started to cough. "It really just started with a cough here and then and then progressively got worse throughout the day." The mother took her to the walk-in clinic. The doctor did a swab, and 2 days later, she was diagnosed.

And she's not alone. Manitoba Health says the Southern Regional Health Authority [RHA] would typically see a handful of cases per year. But in 2015, there are more than 40 cases.

Whooping cough (pertussis) is highly contagious disease that can cause severe coughing spells with a "whoop" sound between as people try to take a big breath. The cough can last 6 to 12 weeks. It is most common among infants.

Dr Tim Hilderman, Manitoba's Medical Officer of Health for Vaccines, says in some cases it can be life-threatening. "One of the most complications is a severe pneumonia that can result in hospitalization and, in rare cases, death."

This infant had to be hospitalized. "We went over to the Children's Hospital where they put her in isolation and then because she was not breathing. There are a few times where she would go blue. They put us into 24-hour monitoring and isolation, so we were in a plastic-wrapped room basically and they were all gowning up... It was pretty horrible for us," she said. The infant was in the "danger zone" for 2 days and was in the hospital for a week.

Hilderman says pertussis is cyclical -- there was a larger outbreak in Manitoba in 2012. But he says most of the patients they are seeing in the Southern RHA are not vaccinated. Others, like this infant, have had some of the vaccine. But immunity built up over time. So he says cases are more prevalent among infants less than 6 months, even those following the vaccine schedule, like this infant.

"They haven't had enough vaccine and enough time to build up that immunity so this is where it become very important to have high levels of immunization in a community to prevent spread," he said. "I think what we're learning here is that the coverage rates that we have aren't high enough to prevent these kinds of clusters or outbreaks from occurring. It's very difficult for me to say whether or not that's a phenomenon that's due to the rate today or whether that's more of a phenomenon of the cyclical nature of the disease and the rates over time," he said.

Hilderman says adults who haven't been vaccinated should get a booster shot. He says they also try to boost infant caregivers as well.

Health officials are warning parents and guardians of children at Range Lake North School in Yellowknife [Northwest Territories, NT] that their child may have been exposed to a student with whooping cough. The school sent out a letter today [3 Nov 2015] about the bacterial infection, also called pertussis, which is transmitted though sneezing and coughing. Symptoms include a persistent cough, fever, runny nose, and sneezing.

The risk of serious and sometimes deadly complications is highest in babies and young children, especially those who have not been vaccinated. The Public Health Agency of Canada recommends adults be immunized against whooping cough if they are in regular contact with an infant.

The pertussis vaccine is part of the routine NT immunization schedule, but according to the health authority the protection from immunizations can start to wane or be less effective by age 9 or 10. The immunization schedule calls for booster vaccinations for tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis in Grade 9 and every 10 years for adults over 18.

A similar letter was sent out to parents of students attending Yellowknife's William McDonald school in September 2015 after a child at that school was diagnosed with pertussis.

Alberta Health Services declared a pertussis outbreak in northern Alberta in August 2015.

Dr Yves Lager, the medical officer of health in the eastern region, released the updated numbers on the whooping cough outbreak on Thursday morning, 29 Oct 2015. He said most of the whooping cough, or pertussis, cases are in the greater Moncton area [southeastern New Brunswick].

"The profile of the cases we've seen in the last week remains really similar to what we've seen so far in this outbreak," said Lager. "Most cases have been in children and adolescents. Most cases for which we have vaccine information indicates that they are up to date with their pertussis vaccine."

Lager said with this outbreak, public health has been closely monitoring its supply of the vaccines due to an increase in demand. "We've received a large shipment on [Tue 27 Oct 2015], which will be more than enough to meet both our routine and outbreak needs," said Lager. Approximately 12 000 doses of whooping cough vaccine were delivered in that shipment.

While confirmed cases have been reported among people who have been vaccinated, Lager said that likely has to do with a decreased effectiveness. He said this can happen as people get closer to the time when they are due for their next pertussis booster immunization.

Lager said the number of confirmed cases in October 2015 is similar to the number of confirmed cases in September 2015.

[In the latest Public Health Agency of Canada's Update on Pertussis Vaccination in Pregnancy http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/naci-ccni/acs-dcc/2014/pvip-vcpg_0214-eng.php published in 2014, it is stated:

"National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) does not recommend a universal program for vaccination of pregnant women given the current epidemiology in Canada.

In special circumstances, such as a regional outbreak situation, immunization with Tdap may be offered to pregnant women (26 weeks or more of gestation) irrespective of their immunization history.

Every effort should be made to administer one dose of pertussis containing vaccine in adulthood. Therefore, one dose of combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis containing vaccine (Tdap) can be offered to pregnant women (at 26 weeks of gestation or more) who have not been previously vaccinated against pertussis in adulthood."

In the USA, however, the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6207a4.htm) states:
"In October 2011, in an effort to reduce the burden of pertussis in infants, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that unvaccinated pregnant women receive a dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap). Vaccination of women with Tdap during pregnancy is expected to provide some protection to infants from pertussis until they are old enough to be vaccinated themselves. Tdap given to pregnant women will stimulate the development of maternal antipertussis antibodies, which will pass through the placenta, likely providing the newborn with protection against pertussis in early life, and will protect the mother from pertussis around the time of delivery, making her less likely to become infected and transmit pertussis to her infant. The 2011 Tdap recommendation did not call for vaccinating pregnant women previously vaccinated with Tdap. On 24 Oct 2012, ACIP voted to recommend use of Tdap during every pregnancy. This report summarizes data considered and conclusions made by ACIP and provides guidance for implementing its recommendations. These updated recommendations on use of Tdap in pregnant women aim to optimize strategies for preventing pertussis morbidity and mortality in infants."

Most of the morbidity and mortality from pertussis occurs in infants less than 6 months of age, especially neonates. Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different with periods of apnea [breathing arrest] sometimes with hypoxia-induced [low oxygen] seizures usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000 and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs for mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental oxygen in the hospital and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care.

A recent publication confirms that safety of maternal pertussis immunization: Kharbanda EO, Vazquez-Benitez G, Lipkind HS, et al: Evaluation of the association of maternal pertussis vaccination with obstetric events and birth outcomes.
