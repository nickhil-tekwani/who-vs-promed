EMERGENCE OF PLANT DISEASES
===========================
Date: 5 March, 1997
From: Pamela Anderson <p.anderson@cgnet.com>

The following is taken from: Anderson, P.K. & F.J. Morales. 1994.
The emergence of new plant diseases: the case of insect-transmitted
plant viruses. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 740:181-
194. [Special edition, Disease in Evolution, Eds. M.E. Wilson, R.
Levins, A. Spielman]
If any ProMED-mail/ProMED-plant subscribers have additional cases -
especially for plant fungi, bacteria, phytoplasmas, viroids or
phytomonas - that you believe fit into the catorgories below, or if
you would like to propose additional conditions for the emergence
of plant disease, we would welcome your postings!

Conditions giving rise to disease
---------------------------------
In their working paper on preparing for new infectious disease,
Levins et al. (1) identified numerous conditions which they believe
may give rise to disease emergence in humans. The same conditions
may be considered to explain the emergence of plant viruses.

Ecological or social change brings host (plant species) into
contact with unknown vector or pathogen
-------------------------------------------------------------
Cacao is native to South America. It was introduced into West
Africa where most of the cacao is currently produced. The first
introductions of cacao into West Africa occurred in the latter part
of the 19th century. In Ghana, for instance, cacao production
increased from 0.3 tons of cacao beans in 1891, to over 40,000 tons
in 1911. The swollen shoot disease was first noticed in 1936 (2)
after the virus had been introduced into cacao plantations by mealy
bugs from indigenous trees (3). Since that year, over 160 million
trees, affected by cacao swollen shoot virus, have died or have
been eradicated in West Africa (4).

New habitats are created which permit a rare or remote
microorganism (virus) to become abundant and in contact with plants
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Rice yellow mottle sobemovirus, was originally restricted to the
Kisumu district of Kenya (5). Following large irrigation projects
in East Africa, rice and other grasses became extensively
cultivated or disseminated, respectively, in the region, persisting
through dry seasons. These intensive rice cultivation practices
and an abundance of diverse grass species lead to a build up of the
virus and its beetle vectors in the irrigated areas, resulting in
the dissemination of the virus throughout West Africa (6).

The pathogen is introduced into previously unexposed populations
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Citrus tristeza closterovirus (CTV) was probably introduced into
South America (via Argentina) from Africa, between 1927 and 1930
(7). The presence of an efficient aphid vector, _Toxoptera
citricidus_ (Kirkaldy), also introduced from Asia into South
America, accelerated the dissemination of CTV in this continent.
The vectors occurring in the United States, _Aphis gossypii_ Glover
and _A. spiraecola_ Patch, are inefficient by comparison. By 1950,
over 6 million citrus trees had been destroyed in a single state of
Brazil (Sao Paulo), and several million more citrus trees have died
or declined in South America and the United States (California,
Florida) since 1930 (8).

Population movements bring non-resistant (plant) populations in
contact with populations that harbor pathogens without severe
morbidity
----------------------------------------------------------------
Potato Y potyvirus (PVY) is common in commercial potato-growing
areas, where this virus is found with the absence of noticeable
symptoms. These PVY strains are readily transmitted by aphids from
potatoes to several non-cultivated hosts. The wild PVY sources are
responsible for the severe epidemics that have occurred in
commercial plantings of tobacco, tomato, and pepper, in areas with
a history of potato production (9).

(Plant) populations become more vulnerable to disease through
drugs, malnutrition, or environmental stresses
---------------------------------------------------------------
Bean common mosaic is the most widely distributed disease of the
common bean Phaseolus vulgaris. Pathogenic variability is
represented by at least 10 well-characterized bean common mosaic
potyvirus (BCMV) strains, which interact with specific recessive
genes present in some bean genotypes in a gene-for-gene fashion.
Disease (common mosaic) occurs when the virus strain possesses
matching pathogenicity genes or when bean genotypes do not possess
genes for resistance to the virus. However, incorporation of a
single non-specific dominant gene effectively prevents the chronic
systemic infection of all bean genotypes by any of the known
strains of the virus. Furthermore, the virus cannot become seed-
borne in bean genotypes possessing the dominant gene. Because BCMV
has a restricted host range outside _Phaseolus vulgaris_, the
monoculture of bean cultivars possessing monogenic dominant
resistance should result in the eradication of the disease.
However, this type of resistance can 'break down' when common
mosaic-resistant cultivars are grown under high temperature
conditions, characteristic of tropical summer-time seasons as well
as some marginal areas where beans have been displaced by more
profitable cash crops. When challenged by certain BCMV strains,
the bean common mosaic-resistant plants grown under high-
temperature stress develop systemic necrosis (hypersensitivity)
that results in total yield loss (plant death) (10).

Pathogens spill over from other species
----------------------------------------
Cucumoviruses are multi-component isometric plant viruses that
contain genomic, subgenomic, and sometimes other RNA species known
as satellite RNAs, which may significantly modify pathogenicity.
Cucumoviruses have a broad pathogenicity spectrum, infecting no
less than 775 species in different plant families, particularly
species of the Cucurbitaceae (11). Since the 1970s, several
cucumoviruses have been isolated from severely affected species of
the Fabaceae. The pathogenic specialization of cucumoviruses to
legumes is now a well documented phenomenon, which continues to
grow in complexity due to the seed-transmission of cucumoviruses
and continuous attack of cultivated legumes by cucumoviruses
transmitted by aphids from other crops, mainly cucurbits.

Pathogens 'evolve' towards greater virulence
----------------------------------------------
Plant pathogens in general have demonstrated their ability to
overcome vertical resistance conditioned by single resistance genes
in plants. A gene-for-gene relationship has been demonstrated for
bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) and its host _Phaseolus vulgaris_,
the common bean. Briefly, pathogenic variants of BCMV have been
arising as a result of the cultivation of bean genotypes possessing
strain-specific recessive genes for BCMV resistance. The most
recently characterized strains of BCMV have the ability to attack
most recessive resistance genes present in bean cultivars.
Additionally, necrosis-inducing BCMV strains capable of challenging
non-specific dominant resistance, are now predominant in certain
bean-growing regions, particularly in East Africa.

Mixed pathogen communities allow for hybridization or recombination
creating new pathogenic types
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The possibility of creating infectious pseudo-recombinants between
the DNA A and B components of the bean golden mosaic, African
cassava mosaic and tomato golden mosaic geminiviruses has already
been demonstrated (12, 13, 14).

Bioengineered organisms escape or are released into the environment
and evolve
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The introduction of an avirulent mutant (strain 1) of tomato mosaic
tobamovirus in northern England, during 1972-1974, in order to
protect tomato seedlings from more virulent strains (cross-
protection phenomenon), resulted in the appearance of virulent
forms of strain 1 in all commercial plantings where the mutant had
been released (15, 16).

It is clear, that under appropriate conditions, new diseases have
emerged and will continue to emerge. The critical issue is not the
emergence of new diseases, per se, but rather the rate of emergence
of new plant diseases. Over the last two decades, epidemics caused
by insect-transmitted plant viruses, in crops of economic and
nutritional importance, have increased both in frequency and
severity.
