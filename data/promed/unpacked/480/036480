Several outbreaks of a disease in cattle holdings have allegedly been
observed recently in the Turkish province of Sanliurfa, southeast
Anatolia. According to the source, the main observed signs of the
disease are fever, being recumbent, a lack of appetite, and -- in
dairy cattle -- a sudden drop of milk production. The disease affects
a considerable proportion of the animals in the affected herds, is of
a short duration and, in most cases, the recovery seems to be complete.

Such signs may probably be indicative of bovine ephemeral fever
(BEF), an arthropod-borne viral disease, also called three days
sickness. BEF is known to occur in most tropical and subtropical
areas of Africa, Australia, the Middle East and Asia but is not found
in Europe, North or South America, or New Zealand. The disease is
caused by an arbovirus of the family _Rhabdoviridae_, a member of the
genus _Ephemerovirus_, and is spread by the movement of the host or
by vectors. Final diagnosis can be achieved by serology and PCR; if
possible, the virus should be isolated from the blood of viremic
animals, but this is, in many cases, unsuccessful. BEF is not zoonotic.

Firsthand confirmation or otherwise, and laboratory results if
available, are requested. Likewise, information on similar recent
observations from other middle eastern countries will be appreciated.
