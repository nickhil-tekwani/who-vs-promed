An outbreak of anthrax has been registered in the town of
Novotroizkiy in Minusin. In one household, a hog has become ill.
Later, veterinary scientists diagnosed anthrax. As required, the
carcass was burnt and all nearby buildings were disinfected with
chlorine solution. Tissue samples have been sent to Minusin district
laboratory for further analysis and confirmation [of the anthrax
diagnosis].
A few days later, the owner of the hog had felt ill, suffering from
fever and rash. The man was urgently hospitalized to the infectious
diseases hospital. According to physicians he is currently in serious
condition.
Quarantine has been declared in Novotroizkiy. According to the chief
veterinary physician Nikolay Molin, the key thing now is to identify
the source of infection; otherwise an epidemic is unavoidable. It
[could] affect the 2000 people residing in Novotroizkiy and 700
livestock.

[It is clear that this report is incomplete. If the disease was
diagnosed early, e.g., before the index carcass was butchered, an
area-wide quarantine would be a stretch. On the other hand if the
reported sick pig was the 2nd or 3rd animal affected, the response
makes more sense, as the earlier cases might well have been butchered
and the meat sold in a local street market or wherever. Also at this
time, a formal diagnosis of human cutaneous anthrax has not been
released -- the report has symptoms of a fever and "rash" -- but this
could otherwise be any of a number of clinical conditions unrelated
to anthrax. Note the earlier outbreak in Novosibirsk eventually
diagnosed as a _S. aureus_ and _S. epidermidis_ infection.
Krasnoyarsk is in Eastern Russia, east of Novosibirsk and north of
western Mongolia. Not normally a hotbed of anthrax. - Mod.MHJ]
