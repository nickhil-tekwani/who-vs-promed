of fatalities is in Uttar Pradesh, where 231 deaths and 1315 cases
have been reported. In Assam, 23 children died and 103 were affected.

[This report implies that Japanese encephalitis has definitely
occurred in Uttar Pradesh, whereas previous reports (see ProMED

that the cases of encephalitis have been laboratory confirmed.
