[1] WHO recommends new name for monkeypox disease
Date: Mon 28 Nov 2022

Following a series of consultations with global experts, WHO will begin using a new preferred term "mpox" as a synonym for monkeypox. Both names will be used simultaneously for one year while "monkeypox" is phased out.

When the outbreak of monkeypox expanded earlier this year [2022], racist and stigmatizing language online, in other settings, and in some communities was observed and reported to WHO. In several meetings, public and private, a number of individuals and countries raised concerns and asked WHO to propose a way forward to change the name.

Assigning names to new and, very exceptionally, to existing diseases is the responsibility of WHO under the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and the WHO Family of International Health Related Classifications through a consultative process which includes WHO Member States.

WHO, in accordance with the ICD update process, held consultations to gather views from a range of experts, as well as countries and the general public, who were invited to submit suggestions for new names. Based on these consultations, and further discussions with WHO's Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO recommends the following:

- Adoption of the new synonym mpox in English for the disease.
- Mpox will become a preferred term, replacing monkeypox, after a transition period of one year. This serves to mitigate the concerns raised by experts about confusion caused by a name change in the midst of a global outbreak. It also gives time to complete the ICD update process and to update WHO publications.
- The synonym mpox will be included in the ICD-10 online in the coming days. It will be a part of the official 2023 release of ICD-11, which is the current global standard for health data, clinical documentation, and statistical aggregation.
- The term "monkeypox" will remain a searchable term in ICD, to match historic information.

Considerations for the recommendations included rationale, scientific appropriateness, extent of current usage, pronounceability, usability in different languages, absence of geographical or zoological references, and the ease of retrieval of historical scientific information.

Usually, the ICD updating process can take up to several years. In this case, the process was accelerated, though following the standard steps.

Various advisory bodies were heard during the consultation process, including experts from the medical and scientific and classification and statistics advisory committees which constituted of representatives from government authorities of 45 different countries.

The issue of the use of the new name in different languages was extensively discussed. The preferred term mpox can be used in other languages. If additional naming issues arise, these will be addressed via the same mechanism. Translations are usually discussed in formal collaboration with relevant government authorities and related scientific societies.

WHO will adopt the term mpox in its communications, and encourages others to follow these recommendations, to minimize any ongoing negative impact of the current name and from the adoption of the new name.

[4] Spain: monitoring monkeypox virus in saliva and air samples

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
The transmission of monkeypox virus occurs through direct contact, but transmission through saliva or exhaled droplets and aerosols has not yet been investigated. We aimed to assess the presence of monkeypox virus DNA and infectious virus in saliva samples and droplets and aerosols exhaled from patients infected with monkeypox virus.

Findings
Between [18 May and 15 Jul 2022], 44 patients with symptomatic monkeypox attended 2 health centers in Madrid and were included in the study. All were cisgender men, with a median age of 35 years (IQR 11·3). We identified high loads of monkeypox virus DNA by qPCR in 35 (85%) of 41 saliva samples. Infectious monkeypox virus was recovered from 22 (67%) of 33 saliva samples positive for monkeypox virus DNA. We also found a significant association between the number of affected cutaneous areas or general symptoms and the viral load present in saliva samples. Droplets exhaled from patients with monkeypox, detected inside a mask, contained monkeypox virus DNA in 32 (71%) of 45 samples, with 2 of the 32 positive samples showing the presence of the infectious virus. Monkeypox virus DNA in aerosols, collected from the medical consultation room, was detected in 27 (64%) of 42 samples, despite patients wearing an FFP2 mask during the visit. Infectious virus was not recovered from aerosol samples. High levels of monkeypox virus DNA were identified in aerosols collected from a hospital isolation room housing a patient with monkeypox.

Interpretation
The identification of high viable monkeypox virus loads in saliva in most patients with monkeypox and the finding of monkeypox virus DNA in droplets and aerosols warrants further epidemiological studies to evaluate the potential relevance of the respiratory route of infection in the 2022 monkeypox virus outbreak.

[5] China: new mRNA vaccines development
Date: Fri 25 Nov 2022
Source: China Daily [edited]
https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202211/25/WS63801623a31057c47eba0fed.html


Chinese drugmaker Sinopharm said on [Wed 23 Nov 2022] that it is developing 3 potential mRNA vaccines for monkeypox. The experimental vaccines have been shown in a study to significantly evoke specific antibodies against monkeypox in mice, the company said in a statement.

Compared with attenuated virus vaccines, which are currently available, the new vaccines are believed to be safer and capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies that can prevent infection more quickly, it said.

The research is being led by Yang Xiaoming, chairman of China National Biotech Group, a unit administered by Sinopharm. Research results were published on bioRxiv, a preprint platform on [Tue 22 Nov 2022].

"The release of these data has filled a gap in monkeypox-specific vaccines based on mRNA technology and helps prepare for the possible spread of monkeypox virus," Sinopharm said.

The company made a key step in vaccine development in late October [2022] when it announced having successfully isolated monkeypox virus strains from clinical samples of infected patients. However, developing new vaccines typically requires years of research and clinical trials before reaching the public. Animal studies and 3 phases of human trials are some of the prerequisites for gaining market approval in China.

The mRNA technology behind the vaccine candidates contains genetic instructions for cells to make viral proteins that prime the immune system. Messenger RNA vaccines attracted considerable interest since the COVID-19 pandemic for their high efficacy and safety despite being a relatively novel tool. China is also developing homegrown COVID-19 vaccines using mRNA technology, but no injections have gained approval so far.

Because monkeypox and smallpox viruses are highly similar in genome makeup and their antibodies have shown significant cross-protection, it is widely believed that smallpox vaccines can provide some immunity against monkeypox.

Currently, there are 3 smallpox vaccines available worldwide. One of them, called Jynneos, was approved for monkeypox around 2019 and is being widely deployed to battle monkeypox outbreaks in some regions.

[6] Pre- and asymptomatic viral shedding in high-risk contacts of mpox

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Epidemiological data suggest that clade IIb monkeypox virus (MPXV) is readily transmitted during sexual contact, even before symptom onset. However, presymptomatic shedding of MPXV remains to be demonstrated. Here, we prospectively followed up 25 individuals after high-risk exposure to MPXV. Daily anorectal, genital, and saliva samples and weekly blood and oropharyngeal samples were collected along with clinical information. During follow-up, 12/18 (66%) sexual and 1/7 (14%) non-sexual contacts showed evidence of MPXV infection by PCR, 5 of whom had low viral loads and no typical MPXV symptoms. In 5/6 (83.3%) patients with typical symptoms, viral DNA was detected as early as 4 days before symptom onset and in 3 of them, replication-competent virus was found. These findings emphasize the high risk of MPXV transmission during sexual contact and confirm the existence of presymptomatic viral shedding of MPXV. Sexual contacts of an MPXV-infected partner should abstain from sex irrespective of symptoms.

Conclusion
--------
First, our findings indicate that the risk of infection after exposure to clade IIb MPXV through sexual contact is much higher than previously appreciated. In contrast, the risk for household and other non-sexual contacts is low. Unfortunately, due to the waning epidemic in Belgium after July 2022, we could not recruit the predefined sample size of 140 participants, which would allow us to estimate the risk of infection more accurately.

Second, our data demonstrate that even though skin lesions and proctitis were common features in MPX cases reported during the 2022 global outbreak, such clinical presentations may be less common than generally assumed, as less than half of the infected cases in our study presented with typical monkeypox symptoms, and only one 3rd had skin lesions. Notably, the atypical cases reported here generally had low viral loads, and most were vaccinated either through PEV or during childhood. They might, therefore, have been able to suppress viral replication and the development of full-blown disease.

Last, we detected presymptomatic MPXV DNA and even replication-competent virus in 5 out of 6 participants with typical MPX symptoms, as early as 4 days before symptom onset. In reality, presymptomatic shedding might start even earlier, as 7 cases in our study were already PCR-positive at inclusion. The existence of presymptomatic transmission was suggested by an epidemiological study of surveillance and contact tracing data in the United Kingdom, which found that the median serial interval in 79 case-contact pairs was shorter than the median incubation period of 54 cases in the data set and that exposure of the contact took place during the presymptomatic phase of the index case in 10 out of 13 case-contact pairs. We now provide biological evidence that infected individuals are infectious during the presymptomatic phase, corroborating the epidemiological evidence of presymptomatic transmission. Moreover, we show that anorectal and, to a lesser extent, saliva and genital self-sampling are useful to detect such early-stage infections.

In conclusion, our data emphasize the high risk of infection during sexual contact, even in the presymptomatic phase. Contacts of MPX cases should be aware of the possibility of presymptomatic viral transmission and advised to abstain from sex irrespective of symptoms.
