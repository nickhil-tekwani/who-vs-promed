A Victorian farm is in quarantine after a suspected case of deadly anthrax disease, the 2nd case in the area in just over a week. Agriculture Victoria confirmed on Saturday [11 Mar 2017] that a farm in Nyah, in the state's north west, has been quarantined and a suspected infected carcass destroyed.

Results from testing are expected on Sunday [12 Mar 2017], and an Agriculture Victoria team will remain at the property until "no further infected animals are detected". All at-risk animals have also been vaccinated. The latest suspected case comes after 34 sheep died at a Swan Hill farm on 3 Mar 2017, with testing confirming that anthrax was present in one of the sheep.

Anthrax is a bacterial infection commonly found in the soil during hot, dry conditions, and it causes a rapid death once animals are affected.

[There are, unfortunately, no details indicating how this case may have come about. But I suspect that if this case is confirmed that the Victoria veterinary service will very seriously consider advising all stations with anthrax cases in the last 10 years not only to be more watchful over their stock but also to plan for revaccinating their livestock. - Mod.MHJ
