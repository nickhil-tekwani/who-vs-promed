Given the paralytic bovine rabies outbreak detected in the ejido [communal lands] of San Pedro in the town of Anonas, Aquismon municipality, it is not necessary to declare an alert, but it is a call to farmers to continue vaccinating their herds against "derringue" [local Mexican term for vampire bat transmitted bovine rabies. - Mod.TY]

This was stated by the president of the Huasteca Potosina Regional Livestock Union, Angel Pineda de la Vega, in order to avoid [rabies] infections such as those in Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon, where the mortality is quite high. Granted that there have been cases in the Huasteca region for a while, but with the vaccination an outbreak has been avoided; in 2012 there are just 30 laboratory-confirmed positive cases.

Although there are state government subsidies [for vaccines], more help is needed so that livestock owners can have access to the vaccine that costs 4.50 pesos [USD 0.34], and to continue capturing [and eliminating] the bats that transmit "derringue" in order to avoid a more serious situation that affects livestock production.

In just 3 months there were more than 2000 cases reported in Tamaulipas, as there were in Nuevo Leon, indicating that the situation is difficult.

He said that in 2011, the Huasteca region livestock producers applied 350 000 doses of vaccine, but greater coverage is needed for general reinforcement in order to avoid more outbreaks, and livestock producers must participate more actively in the campaign.

Currently, it is difficult to eradicate this problem, but it can be controlled, so they have to continue working to combat the bat that causes [transmits] this disease [virus] in the Huasteca region.

[Vampire bat transmitted paralytic bovine rabies is an ongoing problem in the Huasteca region. This is an area located in parts of the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Puebla, Hidalgo, San Luis Potosi, and Queretaro. It is a major livestock raising area in Mexico.

Although the cost of a dose of the vaccine appears to be low, when many head of livestock are involved, the total expense can be considerable, particularly for those livestock raisers of limited financial means. However, the value of one lost animal greatly exceeds the cost of vaccinating a small herd.

The bat involved in this area is _Desmodus rotundus_. Bat control has been a common practice in the attempt to prevent rabies transmission to livestock. However, a recent field study casts doubt about its effectiveness as a rabies control measure.
