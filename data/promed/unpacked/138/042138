A rabies-infected dog on Sunday [8 Jan 2012] bit 16 persons at Jamunagachhi. Two people thrashed the animal to death. Of the bite victims, 10 received post-exposure vaccination against rabies virus infection at Koshi Zonal Hospital, while the rest were administered vaccine at private medical centres. Most of the victims are students and government employees.

Sources at Koshi Zonal Hospital said they administered anti-rabies vaccine to 35 dog bite victims from Biratnagar and its adjoining areas.

[Biratnagar is a sub-metropolitan city in southeast Nepal. Biratnagar is an industrial centre with many industries located in and around its suburbs. It is near the border with India and is, therefore, a major centre for trade and commerce with India. A map showing its location can be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biratnagar.

Canine rabies remains endemic in Nepal and is a serious problem in urban as well as rural areas despite continuous surveillance control activities. In this respect, it would have been appropriate to have recovered neural tissue from the rabid animal for genomic analysis. - Mod.CP]
