A mass wild bird die off has occurred in the Ukrainian part of the
Sea of Azov near the Berdyansk spit [Zaporizhia region]. About 1500
birds were found dead, among them, about 1000 cormorants and 500
silver sea gulls. The Ukrainian Ministry of Emergencies has informed
that the incident was discovered last Friday (22 Oct 2010).

The dead birds were seen on an island in the northern part of the Sea
of Azov. The Zaporizhia regional office of the Ministry of
Emergencies has assumed control of the investigation to determine the
cause of the die off. Specialists have collected specimens from the
birds and from the sea for laboratory analysis.
