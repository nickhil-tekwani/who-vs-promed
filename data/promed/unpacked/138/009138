I do not have my own data on incidence of rodentborne disease in humans,
but I can contribute some data on sigmodontines. Our group has been
trapping mice in north western Argentina, Salta province. The species we
trapped belonged mainly to the genus _Akodon_ (spegazzini, simulator, and
others), but we also trapped _Oryzomys legatus_, _Oligoryzomys chacoensis_,
_Calomys venustus_, and _Oxymycterus paramensis_.
Trapping was scarce in spring, when animals were principally adults; peaked
in summer with a majority of juveniles; and slightly declined during fall,
when mainly young adults were captured.
Only 0.5 per cent of the mice died in the trap. We attributed these deaths
to hyperthermia. In the rest we did not find any apparent disease, only
external parasites including fleas, mites, lice, and ticks.
In a few mice, we found botflies (_Cuterebra_ spp.) and _Tunga penetrans_.
All of them tested negative for hantavirus. Around 40 per cent were
Leptospira seropositive, but kidney cultures were all negative.
Other agents for which they were tested included _Rickettsia rickettsii_,
_Anaplasma phagocytophila_, and _Ehrlichia canis_. Antibodies against the
first were found in 15 per cent of the mice in summer and in 51 per cent in
fall.

Various species of _Akodon_ (I'm not sure what the original author is
including when she says Akodontines) and _Oryzomys_ (some include
_Oligoryzomys_ as a subgenus of _Oryzomys_) are considered to be the
primary sylvatic reservoirs in various regions of South America. _Oryzomys_
also has been reported to be infected in Bolivia. With the exception of
some more recent work in Brazil (see Almeida and colleagues 1980s, 1990s),
most of the South American references are quite dated and should be viewed
with caution.
Nevertheless, I think the evidence for the involvement of _Oryzomys_ in
sylvatic plague cycles in some regions of South America (Brazil especially)
is pretty solid. Also, Dr Emmons was trapping rice rats when she came down
with plague in 1989. If you need a description of rodents reported to be
involved in plague foci in different regions of the world, see the chapter
I wrote for Topley and Wilson's Microbiology and Microbial Infections -
Bacterial Infections (volume 3), which is on the web and can be downloaded
from Norm Gratz's chapter from the WHO Plague Manual (go to the World
Health Organization site and do search for plague; the manual should pop
up. It's downloadable as PDF files).
Epizootics involving _Oryzomys_ have been noted in Brazil (De la Barrera,
1960). With the possible exception of Brazil, it's difficult to find hard
data for plague foci in South America. In general, I think it's safe to say
that these rodents are involved in sylvatic plague cycles and that severe
epizootics are likely to occur among susceptible populations. This will be
especially true when populations of these rodents increase to high numbers
for one reason or another.
Severe epizootic equals massive die-off. _Oryzomys_, like _Sigmodon_ and
many other species, can experience irruptions followed by rapid declines in
population densities. These might be due to starvation, stress, other
diseases, etc. Plague could cause a huge die-off.

[This would seem to close this thread. Die-offs within a rodent population
may be caused by plague as well as other causes, but so far no infectious
disease or toxin has been related to this rodent die-off. Unless other
information becomes available, this thread is cut. - Mod.TG]
