Missouri's tick season officially got under way late last month
[April 2009] with the year's 1st confirmed case of a potentially
life-threatening tick-borne disease. The first illness involved a
woman in her 80s from south of St. Louis. The 1st was hospitalized,
but was later discharged and is now recovering. The woman contracted
the disease known as ehrlichiosis [also called human monocytotropic
ehrlichiosis], which can cause renal failure if left untreated.

Ehrlichiosis is transmitted by the lone star tick and symptoms begin
with a sudden onset of fever and headache. Patients often report
fatigue and muscle aches as well as other flu-like symptoms. Without
prompt treatment, ehrlichiosis can be fatal. The illness can be
treated with antibiotic doxycycline in both adults and children. Tick
bites caused a record number of tick-borne diseases last year [2008],
when the 1st case also was confirmed in late April. Missouri health
officials are urging people to check their bodies for ticks if they
have been outdoors.

State health department statistics show that the number of tick-borne
illnesses in Missouri grew to 668 last year [2008], up nearly 100
compared with 2007. That gave Missouri a rate of 11 tick-borne
illnesses for every 100 000 Missourians. The most commonly reported
tick-borne diseases in Missouri are Rocky Mountain spotted fever,
ehrlichiosis, and tularemia.

Tick checks are especially important for people over the age of 50,
who have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill and being
hospitalized if they are bitten by an infected tick. "After being
outdoors, even in your own yard, check yourself for ticks," Pue said.
"If you live alone, use a hand-held or full-length mirror to view all
parts of your body." Pue warned that Rocky Mountain spotted fever,
ehrlichiosis, and tularemia can lead to serious complications if they
are not recognized early. All 3, however, are effectively treated
with antibiotics. The key symptoms to watch for after a tick bite are
a sudden fever and severe headache, sometimes with chills, body
aches, nausea, or vomiting. The rashes that can occur with Missouri
tick-borne diseases usually do not appear until a person has been ill
for 4 or 5 days. People may want to think about contacting their
health care provider if those symptoms follow a tick bite or possible
exposure to ticks.

Tick bite prevention basics
---------------------------
- Reduce tick habitat around the home and avoid heavy brush and tall
grass elsewhere -- Keep the lawn cut short and cut back tall grass
and brush from around the property.
- Keep ticks off your skin -- Before spending time outdoors, apply a
repellent that contains 20 percent to 50 percent DEET, and read the
label to make sure you are using it correctly. Wear long sleeved
shirts tucked into pants, and tuck pants into your socks or boots.
- Perform tick checks -- After being outdoors, even in your own yard,
check yourself, children, and other family members every 2 to 3 hours
for ticks. Look at their clothes and run your fingers over scalp and
skin, looking for small bumps or new "moles," and check hair, ear,
and underarms. At night, before bathing and bed, use a hand-held or
full-length mirror to view all parts of your body.
- Promptly remove attached ticks -- Using a pair of fine-tipped
tweezers, grasp the tick by the head or mouthparts where they enter
the skin. DO NOT grasp the tick by the body. Without jerking, pull
firmly and steadily directly outward. DO NOT twist the tick out or
apply dishwashing soap, a hot match, alcohol, or any other irritant
to the tick in an attempt to get it to back out. Place the tick in a
small container of alcohol to kill it and later discard in the trash.
Clean the bite wound with soap and water and apply a commercial
topical antiseptic. If a portion of the mouthparts of the tick
remains embedded in the skin, it is not necessary to "dig" it out --
cleansing and disinfecting of the tick bite site is all that is recommended.
- Prevent family pets from bringing ticks indoors -- Discourage your
pet from walking through tall brush or grass and carefully check your
dog or cat for ticks before allowing them inside. The removal of tick
habitat around your home should include tall grass and weeds around
outdoor doghouses. Pesticide treatments for any type of tick should
be limited to those areas where pets spend the most time. If you find
ticks on your pets, contact your veterinarian for information about
an appropriate tick treatment.

[Human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (HME) is caused by _Ehrlichia
chaffeensis_, an obligately intracellular gram-negative
rickettsia-like bacteria. HME is an emerging infectious disease, in
part as a consequence of an exploding population of the natural
reservoir of _E. chaffeensis_, white-tailed deer, and the expansion
of the range and population of the vector tick _Amblyomma
americanum_. HME is a prevalent disease in southeastern and
south-central US, where _A. americanum_ is commonly found. Southeast
Missouri is similar to most of the rural southeastern United States
in terms of its white-tailed deer-lone star tick zoonotic cycle of
_E. chaffeensis_ and exposure to the bite of infected ticks.

In a study of HME in southeastern Missouri, 29 (28.4 percent) of 102
patients with a history of fever for 3 days (higher than 37.7 deg
C/99.9 deg F), tick bite or exposure, and no other infectious disease
diagnosis, who were enrolled in a 3-year study, were found to have
had eitherdefinite or probable HME. A definite case had either a)
serologic immunoglobulin (Ig) G rise from less than 1:64 to more than
1:64 with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result, or b)
IgG seroconversion (4-fold rise) to more than 1:128 without positive
PCR or c) positive PCR results in 2 separate laboratories or for at
least 2 target genes, or d) single serum Ig G titer of more than
1:256, or e) positive culture for _E. chaffeensis_. A probable case
had either a) single IgG titers of 1:64 or 1:128, or b) positive PCR
results in one laboratory for only one target gene. In this study,
the calculated incidence for HME for 1997, 1998, and 1999 was 2, 4.7,
and 3 per 100 000 population, respectively. Clinical and laboratory
manifestations included fever (100 percent), headache (72 percent),
myalgia or arthralgia (69 percent), chills (45 percent), weakness (38
percent), nausea (38 percent), leukopenia (60 percent),
thrombocytopenia (56 percent), and elevated aspartate
aminotransferase level (52 percent). Hospitalization occurred in 41
percent of case-patients.

In the United States, _Borrelia burgdorferi_ (the cause of Lyme
disease), _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ (a rickettsia-like
microorganism previously referred to as _Ehrlichia phagocytophila_ ,
the cause of human granulocytic anaplasmosis) and _Babesia microti_
(the cause of babesiosis) share a common arthropod vector, _Ixodes
scapularis_. This tick, along with the white-footed or 'deer' mouse
(_Peromyscus leucopus_), maintain these pathogens in nature. The
diseases these microorganisms cause have a common geographic
distribution in the Northeastern and upper Midwest United States
where this particular tick is commonly found; and patients ill with
anyone of the diseases transmitted by _I. scapularis_ may also be
concurrently infected with the other diseases transmitted by this
same vector. Because of different tick vectors, patients with HME are
unlikely to be co-infected with either _B. burgdorferi_, _A.
phagocytophilum_, or _B. microti_.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America and the CDC have developed
guidelines for the diagnosis and management of tick-borne rickettsial
diseases (Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, HME, and anaplasmosis) (see
MMWR 2006; 55(RR04); 1-27, available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm>. A detailed
discussion of these diseases can also be found in a prior ProMED-mail
post Ehrlichiosis, fatal - USA (MO) 20070607.1849.
