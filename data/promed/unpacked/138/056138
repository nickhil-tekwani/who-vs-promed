[All 4 PPR outbreaks in Morocco, reported since early July 2015, are adjacent to each other in the northwestern part of the country. A total of 10 sheep were affected out of a susceptible population of 1900 animals, without mortality. This is indeed a rather benign disease picture, in line with Mod.AB's comment in the ProMED-MENA posting, "PPR virus is known to cause rather mild disease in sheep in Morocco. On the other hand, since vaccination in response to the outbreak was launched in the affected area, this may explain the observed figures."

According to Morocco's official information to the OIE, PPR was recorded there for the 1st and, until now, the most recent time, between June 2008 and January 2009. Hundreds of outbreaks were reported. Mass vaccination (with a live-attenuated PPR vaccine) was subsequently applied.

According to the reports vaccination has been named as an official control measure each year since 2009 but figures for the recent 3 years are not available.

PPR, as one of the most damaging of all animal diseases, is among the priority diseases indicated in the FAO-OIE Global Framework for the Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases (GF-TADs) 5 Year Action Plan. In response to recommendations of GF-TADs, a resolution by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE (May 2014) and recommendations of the Committee on Agriculture (COAG) and the Council of FAO, the GF-TADs Working group has developed the PPR Global Control and Eradication Strategy, which has been presented at the FAO and OIE International Conference for the Control and Eradication of peste des petits ruminants held in Abidjan (Cote d'Ivoire), from 31 Mar to 2 Apr 2015. - Mod.AS
