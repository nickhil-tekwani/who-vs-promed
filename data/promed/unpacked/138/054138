[For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to the OIE Aquatic Manual 2016, Chapter 2.4.2 "Infection with _Bonamia exitiosa_" at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=2439&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_bonamia_exitiosa.htm from which the following commentary is quoted:

"_Bonamia exitiosa_ is a Haplosporidia protozoan parasite infecting haemocytes of several oyster species and inducing physiological disorders and eventually death of the animal."

Infection with _B. exitiosa_ is found in _O. chilensis_ in the Foveaux Strait and other locations around South Island, New Zealand; in _O. angasi_ in Australia (Port Philip Bay, Victoria; Georges Bay, Tasmania; and Albany, Western Australia); in _O. edulis_ in Galicia (Spain), in the Adriatic Sea in Italy, in the Mediterranean Sea in France and in Cornwall in the United Kingdom; and in _O. stentina_ in Tunisia."

The European flat oyster is found along the western European coast from Norway to Morocco in the north-eastern Atlantic and in the whole Mediterranean Basin. Natural populations are also observed in eastern North America from Maine to Rhode Island, following intentional introductions in the 1940s and 1950s (http://www.fao.org/fishery/culturedspecies/Ostrea_edulis/en#tcNA0078). - Mod.CRD
