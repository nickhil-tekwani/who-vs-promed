FBI Says Second Anthrax Letter Sent to Senator
----------------------------------------------
FBI and U.S. Postal Service investigators, sifting through unopened letters
to members of Congress, have found a letter addressed to the chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee that appears to contain anthrax spores, the
FBI said on Friday.
The letter addressed to Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, appeared to
be almost identical to another anthrax-laced letter sent last month to
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat. Two postal
workers employed at the facility that processed the 2 letters died last month.

Latest anthrax letter points to US terrorist
--------------------------------------------
An anthrax-laced letter sent to Senator Patrick Leahy and discovered in a
batch of quarantined congressional mail last week could strengthen the
theory that an American extremist is behind the biological terrorism,
writes Sarah Baxter.
Why Osama Bin Laden and his Al-Qaeda network would harbour a grudge against
Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, is far from clear to investigators. But as a
strong advocate of civil liberties Leahy is regarded as the sort of
politician who might be targeted by a home-grown terrorist.
The FBI revealed last week that the letter sent to Leahy was strikingly
similar to that sent to Tom Daschle, the Democrat Senate majority leader.
They were posted on the same date, 9 Oct 2001, and both postmarked Trenton,
New Jersey. The handwriting also appeared to be the same. Investigators
hope the latest find will provide clues to the identity of the sender.

Except for the name and address, the 2 envelopes were similar: They had
block printing with a slight slant to the right; a 9 Oct 2001 postmark from
Trenton, N.J.; and the same, nonexistent school listed as the return address.
All congressional mail set aside after discovery of the Daschle letter has
been inspected, and the Leahy letter was the only suspicious piece, said
Van Harp, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington Field Office.

[When you check the AP photograph of the Leahy letter, it is very clearly
by the same hand that addressed the other known anthrax spore laden
letters. That Leahy was targeted would suggest that he was probably
selected by the terrorist at the time of the improvement of his political
standing in Washington as a result of the changes in the US Senate and the
Democrat party's majority. - Mod.MHJ
