Authorities of the Ministry of Health, through its provincial office in Puerto Plata, denied on Tue [9 Jun 2015] the presence of Zika virus in its jurisdiction.

In the face of the commotion caused by this information, the provincial health director in Puerto Plata, Wadi Musa Valerio, said it was all a false alarm by a young mother, whose 12-year-old child was admitted to a private clinic in Puerto Plata, and whose family mistakenly believed it could be Zika virus.

Valerio Musa said that Zika is a viral disease like dengue and chikungunya, transmitted by the vector mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, but that, in spite of the existence of that mosquito in our country, for months the authorities of the Health Ministry have activated protocols to prevent the entry into the country of Zika, Ebola, and other tropical diseases.

Besides this, epidemiologist Dr Eliza Polanco emphasized that it is not true that this city of Puerto Plata has the 1st recorded case of Zika virus in the country and attributed the rumor to the desperate state of the mother.

The epidemiologist told this writer that from the moment the information was disclosed, the health authorities in Puerto Plata began investigations and verified that in the area of the patient's residence in the south of the municipality, nobody had traveled to countries where there could have been Zika virus [therefore could not have infected local mosquitoes. - Mod.JW], thus epidemiological evidence officially contradicted this rumor and this girl was sent home fully healthy and never had symptoms of the viral disease in question... - more

[This is a confusing report which says that on the one hand the mother was desperate but on the other that the child never had any relevant symptoms. But it shows the strength of rumor and how misleading information can be spread through the news media.

Also, no protocols can prevent the entry of a disease or a mosquito from entering a country undetected; prevention must be at the level of local hospitals to lookout for illness in people who have returned from travel to a country where there is an outbreak, and vector control people looking for mosquito breeding places in and around houses. - Mod.JW
