The Official Bulletin of Castile and Leon [BOCyL] officially declared
the presence of _Erwinia amylovora_ [fireblight] in the localities of
Cacabelos, Sancedo, and Congosto. They are the 1st 3 foci announced
during the summer [2008], the period with greater presence of this
disease, which results in a drying of fruit trees. With these 3
municipalities there are now more than 10 municipalities affected.

According to BOCyL, analyses of specimens taken in Cacabelos,
Sancedo, and Congosto were positive [for fireblight], [making it
necessary] to "tear out the affected trees before 31 Dec [2008]" in
order to prevent further spread of the bacteria. To date, the disease
has already destroyed 25 000 fruit trees in the region.

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_ and is
considered the most destructive disease of pome fruit trees
worldwide. Many varieties of pear, quince, and apple are susceptible,
although the level of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only
members of the _Rosaceae_ sub-family _Pomoideae_ are affected and the
host range covers more than 180 species from 39 genera.

The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of
the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. The bacteria are highly
infectious and are spread by insects, wind, water, mechanical means,
and on plant material (including budwood). They enter the host plant
through wounds. The pathogen has been placed on the quarantine alert
list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). For more
information on fireblight please see links and previous ProMED-mail
posts listed below.
