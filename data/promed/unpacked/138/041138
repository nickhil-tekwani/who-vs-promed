Mesa County Public Health officials said a dead rabbit in Whitewater tested positive for tularemia, also known as rabbit fever. A Mesa County couple called health officials after finding the rabbit on their property. "We've lived out here for over 20 years," said [CW]. "We have a lot of coyotes, bobcats different things, badgers are out here."

Health officials said they have discovered rabbit fever in neighborhoods east and west of the Colorado National Monument.

"This particular rabbit like to go underneath my car; he hung out there most of the day. One day I came out here and he was dead," said [W]. "I bagged it up and took it to the health department, so they examined it and they called me a couple days later saying it was positive for the rabbit disease."

Homeowners who see multiple animals on their properties should call Mesa County Public Health right away, as it could be a sign of unusual disease activity in the area. "In the last few years, we've seen an uptick in detecting it in wildlife and in people," explained Thomas Orr, an epidemiologist with Mesa County Public Health. "We really want to get the message out so people don't get ill with this. If they do have sick pets or get sick themselves, it is treatable."

Bureau of Land Management spokesperson Chris Joyner said the disease is most common near the river. "We've seen a lot of cases of Tularemia connected to the river corridors in our high use areas along the river. We have a lot recreation that takes place there," he said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said to use masks when mowing the lawn to reduce inhaling bacteria. Experts also suggest cooking game meat thoroughly before eating. Tularemia is treatable, according to health officials. They said to contact your health care provider if you notice symptoms including infected ulcer-like bite, swollen glands, fever, dry cough, body aches and headaches.

[A few days ago, there was a report of another dead rabbit infected with _Francicella tularensis_ in Whitewater, CO, about 250 miles west (see ProMED-mail post no. 20170423.4988936).

Tularemia is caused by the Gram negative bacterium _Francisella tularensis_. Tularemia is largely confined to the northern hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the southern hemisphere._Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis_(Type A) is associated with lagomorphs (rabbits and hares) in North America. It is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits.

In addition to vector transmission, tularemia may be spread contact with infected animals or environmental fomites by inhalation, or by ingestion of the poorly cooked flesh of infected animals or contaminated water.
