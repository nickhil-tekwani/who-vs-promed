Tests in Italy have confirmed the 1st poultry outbreaks of H5N1 avian
influenza in the West African country of Benin, according to news services.

Agriculture minister Robert Dovonou said that suspected cases found on 2
farms earlier this month [December 2007] were confirmed by the World
Organisation for Animal Health (Office International des Epizooties; OIE)
in Padua, Italy, according to a 15 Dec 2007 report by Agence France-Presse
(AFP).

The farms are north of Porto Novo, the capital, and in Cotonou, the
commercial capital, both in Benin's southern coastal strip, AFP and Reuters
reported.

Benin is surrounded by countries that have faced poultry outbreaks within
the last 2 years: Nigeria, Togo, Niger, and Burkina Faso. Nigeria has had
one human H5N1 case. Ivory Coast and Ghana are other West African states
that have had poultry outbreaks.

Benin officials reported the 2 suspected outbreaks to the OIE on 5 Dec
2007, saying 100 birds had died and 245 had been killed to stop the
outbreak. Most of the birds were chickens, but 8 turkeys were among
affected poultry on the Cotonou farm.

According to the Reuters report, published today [17 Dec 2007], health
experts have expressed concern that Benin's Voodoo priests could be at risk
for avian flu because of their practice of tearing out the throats of live
chickens in ritual sacrifices.

[In its "immediate notification" to the OIE on 5 Dec 2007, Benin reported
the identification of 2 outbreaks caused by the highly pathogenic avian
influenza virus (see 20071206.3934). One outbreak involved a layer chicken
flock into which there had been illegal introduction of poultry from Ghana.
The other (earlier) outbreak occurred in a small flock wandering in the
village.

The diagnosis was performed by the national laboratory; the serotype of the
virus was, reportedly, "pending". ProMED-mail commented: "It may be assumed
that the virus involved is similar to the one in neighbouring Ghana, namely
H5N1; however, this should be verified and confirmed by a reference
laboratory." The current information provides the said anticipated piece of
information. - Mod.AS]
