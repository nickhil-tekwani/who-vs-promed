Bilharzia Spreading In Swaziland
---------------------------------
Bilharzia [schistosomiasis has been detected among primary school students
in Swaziland's Shiselweni region and health officials in the country warn
that it may be spreading over a wider area.
Regional health inspector William Shongwe said that a diagnosis carried out
at Mhlanga Methodist primary school showed that about 70 percent of the
pupils were infected with bilharzia parasites.
He said many pupils at the school had complained of passing red urine
before their head teacher, Glen Hlophe, called in health inspectors to
carry out the diagnosis.
Shongwe said the number of sufferers might increase as many pupils from at
least 4 primary schools in the same area wade through the snail-infested
Umthobo River which meanders through several communities, including the
town of Nhlangano. He said other pupils at risk were those of Ekuthuleni,
Nsongweni and Ensigweni primary schools.
Health officers are currently conducting an educational survey in the
region before taking action to eradicate the disease.
Shongwe has advised people to report to nearest health centres for
treatment whenever they notice symptoms of the disease which are red urine,
pain after urinating, and kidney failure.
Health officials in Manzini and Hhohho region have also confirmed treating
many bilharzia cases recently. A senior medical officer in the health
ministry, Precious Dlamini, said bilharzia was likely to spread to many
locations because the chemical which the ministry applied in the past to
combat the disease was no longer in use.
The chemical, Baylucide, was withdrawn in 1984 after the environment
department warned against its use. According to Dlamini, out of 8914 pupils
examined last year, 5805 were positive with bilharzia infection.

[Schistosomiasis is endemic to Swaziland. Smaller and larger outbreaks can
be expected according to change in the ecology of an area, e.g., irrigation
systems. - Mod.EP
