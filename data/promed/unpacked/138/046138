Health authorities here [Aleosan, Cotabato Province] Monday, 15 Dec 2014, said they have contained the outbreak of suspected amoebiasis over the weekend that sent 72 villagers to the hospital due to stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Dr. Miguelita Patinio, of Aleosan District Hospital, where the victims were rushed over the weekend, said of the 72 patients, 29 remained in the hospital for a day.

"We have 4 patients still confined and may be discharged today," Dr. Patinio said of the victims all from Sitio Bliss, Barangay Pagangan, Aleosan, North Cotabato. "We learned the patients' source of drinking water came from a communal and open water well," Patinio said, adding that all were positive of amoebiasis.

On Friday [12 Dec 2014], the villagers started experiencing abdominal cramps, diarrhea, vomiting, and fatigue. About 20 of the patients were minors aged 18 and below. Amoebiasis is an infection of the intestines caused by the parasite _Entamoeba histolytica_.

Mayor Vicente Sorupia has ordered chlorination of the current water source while the local government unit (LGU) will look for other water sources. In the meantime, residents were ordered to boil drinking water, he said.

In May 2014, at least 8 persons were killed and about 700 others were hospitalized in an outbreak of cholera in remote villages of Alamada, also in North Cotabato.

Patinio recommended to village officials to direct residents to refrain from taking drinking water from the open well and boil all drinking water before taking them. "This is to prevent the outbreak of another disease that can be taken from contaminated water sources," she said.

[This outbreak seems to be the same one previously reported as cholera (Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (81): Africa, Asia 20141214.3032623). Clinically, the illnesses are quite different with amoebic dysentery causing fever, abdominal pain and tenesmus (pain on passing the stool) with blood and mucus in the stool, and cholera often without fever, minimal abdominal pain and watery diarrhea without blood or mucus. - Mod.LL
