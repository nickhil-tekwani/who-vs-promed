CAMEL POX - SAUDI ARABIA (03): SUSPECTED, DISCUSSION

The posting [20050117.0151] is a highly edited, translated version of the
Arabic original ["Death of camels and cows due to pox near Tabuk, Saudi
Arabia", Okaz, issue 1310, 17 Jan 2005, translated from Arabic], and seems
to have omitted some of the information -- though not detailed -- initially
included. <http://www.okaz.com.sa/okaz/Data/2005/1/17/Art_182380.XML>
Firstly, the original contained a statement from an official of the
Ministry of Agriculture clearly explaining that camel pox was not
transmissible to man or to other animals. This indicates they did not
consider that camel pox was a cause of morbidity or mortality in cows.
The translation omitted the mention of the epidemiologically important
season referred to -- the hail season -- which, according to the report,
predisposes to camel pox in that region. It is also possible that the cows
came down with disease related to the inclement weather. It should be noted
that the original described the farm as a camel farm. The veterinary
intervention mentioned was the use of antivirals (unspecified) and advice
to isolate sick camels from healthy ones. The statement of a camel owner
"that he feared for his gravid animals that were near term" could indicate
that no abortions had been observed thus far and, possibly,
abortion-inducing pathogens could be ruled out.
In addition to the comment of Mod.AS on Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) in the
Arabian Peninsula, it is highly pertinent to note that LSD antibodies had
been detected in the serum of Arabian oryx (_Oryx leucoryx_) at the
National Wildlife Research Centre in Taif, Saudi Arabia, collected as far
back as 1987(1). A full-blown clinical case of LSD was diagnosed and
documented in our centre in a captive-bred female Arabian oryx in 1991(1).
Transmission from local livestock -- sheep, goats and camels -- was
strongly suspected and vector transmission by arthropods fully considered,
though never proven. The said female oryx aborted but was negative for
endemic abortion-inducing diseases such as Brucellosis and Q fever. A
serological test for LSD, carried out in a subset of the same animal group
about 5 years later, was negative for LSD (Ostrowski, S. personal
communication). Furthermore, according to the said paper, and to its
references, LSD may occur in sheep and goats and has been transmitted from
sheep to cattle.

[Dr Shamsudeen Fagbo is gratefully acknowledged for these helpful
explanatory remarks.
Regarding the relationship between the capripox viruses of Lumpy skin
disease and sheep pox: it is generally agreed that LSD virus is
host-specific. For further information, the reader is referred to chapter
2.1.7 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial
Animals: <http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00030.htm> and to M.Hosamani
et al. (2004), Differentiation of Sheep Pox and Goat Poxviruses by Sequence
Analysis and PCR-RFLP of P32 Gene; Virus Genes 29:1, 73-80.
Results of the veterinary investigation into the described outbreak, in
camels and possibly cattle, are cordially anticipated. - Mod.AS]
