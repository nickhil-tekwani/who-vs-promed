The latest victims of El Nino are the coral reefs in the Indian Ocean,
which have suffered considerable bleaching during the first six months of
1998. Scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
have been measuring sea surface temperatures with satellites. They report
the migration of extremely high ocean temperatures from south to north
throughout the Indian Ocean has caused the bleaching and raised concerns
for the reefs' fragile ecosystems.
In 1987 El Nino caused similarly high temperatures in the Indian Ocean;
however, in 1988 the water cooled enough that the reefs in the Indian Ocean
north of the equator were spared heavy bleaching. In 1998, this has not
been the case. Bleaching has been reported in the Indian Ocean reefs of
Seychelles; Kenya; Reunion; Mauritius; Somalia; Madagascar; Maldives;
Indonesia; Sri Lanka; Gulf of Thailand [Siam; Andaman Islands; Malaysia;
Oman; India and Cambodia.
Coral reefs -- the "rain forests of the oceans" -- form the structural and
ecological foundation of the reef system. Every coral species, as well as
numerous other reef inhabitants, maintains a symbiotic relationship with a
microscopic zooxanthallae algae. The zooxanthallae provide their hosts with
oxygen and some organic compounds they produce through photosynthesis. When
stressed, many reef inhabitants have been observed to expel their
zooxanthallae en masse. The polyps of the coral are left without any
pigmentation and appear nearly transparent on the animal's white skeleton.
This is "coral bleaching".
Corals can recover from bleaching unless high ocean temperatures persist
for too long a period or become too warm to permit recovery. The coral's
ability to feed itself in the absence of zooxanthallae seems to be a key to
survival, and reestablishing the symbiotic relationship with zooxanthallae
can take from two months to a year. When the level of environmental stress
is high and sustained, death of the coral may result. This will negatively
affect the rest of the reef ecosystem.
The bleaching events reported prior to the 1980s were generally attributed
to localized phenomena such as major storm events, severe tidal exposures,
sedimentation, rapid salinity changes, pollution, or thermal shock. The
events since 1980 have not been so easily explained. Numerous laboratory
studies have shown a direct relationship between bleaching and water
temperature stress.
Presently the waters in the Indian Ocean appear to be cooling and the area
covered by "Hot Spots" is now only in the northernmost fringes of the
Indian Ocean. However, during June the Philippines and the Florida Keys
regions have been seeing sea surface temperatures high enough that
bleaching has been reported and biologists are concerned for reefs there.
