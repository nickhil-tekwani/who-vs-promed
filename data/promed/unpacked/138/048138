First report of Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus in North Carolina,
United States
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Identity
Name: Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus
Taxonomic position: _Closteroviridae_
Common names: SPCSV
Significance
Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV) was detected for the 1st
time in North Carolina, United States. Sweet potato chlorotic stunt
virus, when found in association with Sweet potato feathery mottle
virus (SPFMV), causes sweet potato virus disease (SPVD), a serious
disease originally described in Africa in the 1970's. Sweet potato
chlorotic stunt virus is the whitefly-transmitted component of the
disease. Sweet potato feathery mottle virus is transmitted by aphids.
The only other U.S. report of SPCSV was from a single accession in
the USDA Sweet Potato Germplasm Repository. No other detections of
SPCSV have been reported in the United States. In both cases of U.S.
SPCSV detection, SPFMV was also present.
Two isolates of SPCSV were collected in North Carolina in 2001 and
2003. The isolates were collected from separate fields of cultivar
Beauregard sweet potatoes; however, they differed by only 6
nucleotides and were identical at the amino acid level. Additional
molecular work suggests this U.S. population is not a recent introduction.
Symptoms of the infected plants were typical of SPVD, including
stunting, leaf narrowing and distortion, vein clearing, and chlorotic mosaic.
Issues of concern
When in association with SPFMV, SPCSV can cause serious yield losses
in susceptible cultivars. Control measures are limited to using clean
planting material and the use of resistant or tolerant cultivars.
Host: _Ipomoea batatas_ (sweet potato)
Dispersal: transmitted by the insect vectors _Bemisia tabaci_ and
_Trialeurodes abutilonea_. Can be spread by infected planting
material and grafting but is not seedborne or likely to be
transmitted by contact between plants.

[Thank you to A. Dodds for supplying this note. SPCSV was previously
known as Sweet potato sunken vein (?) closterovirus but has now been
classified as belonging to the genus _Crinivirus_ in the familiy
_Closteroviridae_. By itself it is symptomless or causes mild vein
yellowing, some sunken secondary veins on adaxial leaf surfaces and
swollen veins on abaxial surfaces in sweet potato. Very severe
diseases occur, however, when the virus is in mixed infections with
Sweet potato feathery mottle virus. The co-infection is called sweet
potato virus disease (SPVD), a devastating disease originally
described in Africa.
Sweet potato is a vitally important food for resource-poor farming
families in Africa. Sweet potato virus disease (SPVD) is its most
damaging disease and affected plants produce only very small tubers.
Resistant local landraces do exist, but these give much lower yields
than susceptible varieties. High-yielding resistant cultivars are needed.
