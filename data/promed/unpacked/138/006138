Bird flu kills more than one thousand chickens in East Lampung
--------------------------------------------------------------
Bird flu (Avian Influenza or the H5N1) virus has stricken 3 sub
districts in East Lampung District, killing at least 1176 chickens.

"In the current rainy season, chickens are prone to various diseases,
including bird flu," Dewanto, head of the East Lampung district
animal health unit, said here on Friday [29 Jan 2010].

Some 1176 chickens had died in 7 villages since early January 2010,
while in 2009 there had been only 708 dead chickens in 11 villages.
The affected villages include Sukadana, Purbolinggo, and Marga Tiga,
East Lampung.

[Lampung (commonly known as Southeast Sumatra) is a province of
Indonesia, located on the southern tip of the island of Sumatra; see
map at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IndonesiaLampung.png>. East
Lampung is one of its 12 regencies.

Indonesia continues to report a high number of H5N1 HPAI outbreaks in
poultry since 2005. HPAI H5N1 is endemic on Java, Sumatra, Sulawesi
and probably Bali islands, with sporadic outbreaks reported
elsewhere. Indonesia leads the world's list of countries with human
H5N1 cases, with 162 out of the world's total of 472 cases, of which
134 were fatal (out of the world's total of 282 reported fatalities);
Vietnam and Egypt are number 2 and 3, respectively.

According to the FAO, village prevalence in Indonesia varies widely.
Only 2 of its 33 provinces have not reported the occurrence of H5N1
HPAI. The high number of reported outbreaks each month is partially
explained by the implementation of the participatory disease
surveillance and response (PDSR) programme that targets village-type
poultry production systems (mainly backyard) and reports evidence of
virus circulation in the village environment.

The programme is financially supported by FAO with USAID and AusAID,
and is operating in 331/448 (74 percent) districts through 31 Local
Disease Control Centres (LDCCs) in 27 out of 33 provinces in Java,
Sumatra, Bali, Sulawesi and Kalimantan, including all known
endemically infected areas. Larger and less densely-populated
provinces report HPAI outbreaks less often than more densely
populated provinces. For additionmal background information, see
commentary in 20090902.3089. - Mod.AS]
