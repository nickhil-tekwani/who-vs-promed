[Note that the reporting interval is now midnight to midnight, presenting the full calendar day. In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 516 cases and 11 deaths.

Daegu province and Gyeongbuk provinces continue to have reported the highest number of cases, 4006 and 774, respectively. Dae-gu is completely surrounded by Gyeongbuk province in the central eastern part of South Korea. Dae-gu has been the epicenter of this ongoing outbreak. While several provinces are at or approaching 100 cases (Gyeonggi: 101, Seoul 99, Busan 93), the rate of growth in numbers of daily new cases appears to be at a slower pace than that seen in Daegu and Gyeongbuk.

C. Iran: 2336 cases, 77 deaths
Date: Tue 3 Mar 2020 12:24 AM MYT
Source: The Star, Associated Press (AP) report [edited]
https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2020/03/04/iran039s-military-on-alert-as-virus-kills-77-sickens-leaders


Iran put its armed forces on alert on Tuesday [3 Mar 2020] to assist health officials in battling the new coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] that has killed at least 77 people, an outbreak that has sickened top officials and pushed even its supreme leader into wearing disposable gloves while trying to reassure the nation. Even as government officials sit metres away from each other at meetings now in an effort to stop its spread, the virus is ravaging both its civilian leadership and its Shiite theocracy. A top emergency official and at least 23 members of parliament reportedly contracted the virus and now suffer from the COVID-19 illness it causes. Others have died.

There are now over 2540 cases of the new virus across the Middle East, with 2336 in Iran alone. Of those outside Iran in the region, most link back to the Islamic Republic. Experts worry Iran's percentage of deaths to infections, now around 3.3%, is much higher than other countries, suggesting the number of infections in Iran may be far greater than current figures show.

Meanwhile, a gloved Ayatollah Ali Khamenei sought to minimise the virus while praising the doctors and nurses combating the outbreak. He urged the nation to pray. "This disaster, in our opinion, is not such a big disaster, there have been and there are bigger disasters than this," Khamenei said. "Of course I don't want to downplay the issue, but let's not exaggerate it much either. Something has happened, it will exist in the country for a time, which hopefully will be short, and then it will go away."

The death of Expediency Council member Mohammad Mirmohammadi on Monday [2 Mar 2020] makes him the highest-ranking official within Iran's leadership to be killed by the virus. State media referred to him as a confidant of Khamenei. The virus earlier killed Hadi Khosroshahi, Iran's former ambassador to the Vatican, as well as a recently elected member of parliament. Ahmad Tuyserkani, an adviser to Iran's judiciary chief, died on Monday night [2 Mar 2020] from the virus, semiofficial media reported. Those sick include vice president Masoumeh Ebtekar, better known as "Sister Mary", the English-speaking spokeswoman for the students who seized the US Embassy in Teheran in 1979 and sparked the 444-day hostage crisis, state media reported. Also sick is Iraj Harirchi, the head of an Iranian government task force on the coronavirus who tried to downplay the virus before falling ill.

On Tuesday [3 Mar 2020], lawmaker Abdolreza Mesri told Iranian state television's Young Journalists Club programme that 23 members of parliament had the coronavirus. He urged all lawmakers to avoid the public. "These people have a close relationship with the people and they carry different viruses from different parts of the country, which may create a new virus, so we recommend the lawmakers to cut off their relationship with the public for now," Mesri said.

Members of Iran's Supreme Council of Economic Coordination, including president Hassan Rouhani, met on Tuesday [3 Mar 2020] and sat metres apart from each other. State media did not comment on the move, nor the fact the meeting appeared attended by fewer officials than normal. Iran's state-run IRNA news agency also reported that Pirhossein Koulivand, head of the country's emergency services, had come down with the new virus. It said he was undergoing treatment.

Khamenei ordered Iran's armed forces to be ready to help health workers, but it wasn't immediately clear what the order entailed. Officials previously said they had plans for 300 000 soldiers and members of the Basij, the all-volunteer force of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, to sanitize public areas, direct traffic and trace contacts that sick people had with others. The Guard also has been spraying down streets in major Iranian cities. "Whatever helps public health and prevents the spread of the disease is good and what helps to spread it is sin," Khamenei said at an annual tree-planting ceremony. He had never worn gloves at the ceremony in recent years.

However, life has slowed in Iran's capital, Tehran, where a perfume seller simply stood at her stand at an upscale mall with no one to offer samples. "People are afraid to touch anything or take anything from us," she said. "Everyone is at a loss."

Meanwhile on Tuesday [3 Mar 2020], the Middle East's largest airline, Emirates, said it had to reduce or ground flights due to the new virus. Because of the slowdown, the government-owned carrier has asked its employees to take paid and even unpaid leave for up to a month at a time. Emirates operates out of Dubai, the world's busiest for international travel. "We have been tested before and Emirates will come out stronger," chief operating officer Adel Al-Redha said.

The world's largest airline trade association, IATA, says Middle East carriers have already lost around USD 100 million in revenue due to a drop in ticket sales because of disruptions caused by the virus.

[In the past 24 hours, the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran has grown from 1501 to 2336, an increase of 835 newly confirmed cases. The number of deaths has also increased from 66 to 77, an increase of 11 new deaths. The number of MPs (members of parliament) in the country who have been infected is curious, 23 out of 290 parliament members (7.9%).

Qom, the apparent epicenter of this outbreak, is located to the south west of Tehran in central Iran. Other media reports have mentioned that Tehran has become a major focus of cases.

Egyptian premier Mostafa Madbouli said Saturday [29 Feb 2020] that Cairo had been informed of the cases, "part of a tourist group visiting in Egypt between [5-16 Feb 2020]".

"Workers at the site where the group stayed have been tested" for the virus, the statement said without revealing its location.

Five new cases of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) were confirmed on Saturday [29 Feb 2020], taking the total for Taiwan to 39, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC). One of the new patients had visited Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, while the 4 others amounted to a hospital cluster outbreak as they had been in contact with case no. 34 at a hospital in north Taiwan.

Authorities in Qatar have temporarily banned all arrivals from Egypt, except Qatari citizens, over fears of the spread of deadly coronavirus.

"As a public health measure, the State of Qatar has imposed a temporary entrance restriction to its territories on all those who are coming from Egypt through intermediate points," the Government Communications Office of Qatar said in a statement sent to Al Jazeera on Sunday [1 Mar 2020]. The measure is temporary due to the spread of COVID-19."

A picture is emerging here... 4 different countries have identified travel from Egypt as the travel preceding onset of COVID-19 illness, somewhat circumstantial evidence that there is transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in Egypt. The action on the part of Qatar, while possibly politically motivated, is highly suggestive of real concerns on the part of countries in the region. Reliable sources in the region have echoed the same concerns.

Another observation is that most of the media reports mentioning numbers of suspected cases in Egypt who tested negative for the SARS-CoV-2, are mentioned to be foreign nationals.

It is very reminiscent of days of yore when Island nations were hesitant to report dengue virus transmission for fear that tourism, a major source of revenue for those islands, would be negatively impacted. The way we would know there was dengue activity was through confirmed cases in travelers returning from those islands. - Mod.MPP]

A. Taiwan: nosocomial cluster
Date: Tue 3 Mar 2020 05:19 PM CST

A woman in her 50s is the nation's 42nd COVID-19 patient and is believed to have contracted the virus while taking care of her husband in a northern Taiwan hospital where a cluster infection occurred, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said on Tuesday [3 Mar 2020]. The latest patient, who has no recent overseas travel history, was taking care of her husband in the hospital from [17-24 Feb 2020]. She sought medical attention at a clinic on [23 Feb 2020] after becoming fatigued and developing a cough, said health minister Chen Shih-chung, who heads the CECC.

The hospital is the location of Taiwan's 1st hospital cluster where authorities believe cases 34 to 38, and 41 contracted the coronavirus, Chen said. The woman's husband was on the same ward, though in a different room, as case 34. The husband, who has already been discharged from the hospital, has tested negative for the virus, according to the CECC.

Health authorities on [1 Mar 2020] decided to have the woman tested after she developed respiratory symptoms and was deemed a potential patient due to her contact with one confirmed case, a nurse who took care of case 34 and became infected, CECC said. The woman has been hospitalized in an isolation room since [1 Mar 2020] and test results confirmed her as having the COVID-19 earlier Tuesday [3 Mar 2020], according to CECC.

The 42nd case is the 7th confirmed case in the hospital cluster. The other patients in the cluster are a female janitor at the hospital -- the 35th case -- 3 nurses, patients 36 to 38, and the daughter of case 34 (case 41), according to the CECC. The CECC said 295 people who came into contact with case 34 have been identified, 6 tested positive for the virus, 206 tested negative, and the others are awaiting their results.

Chen said the health authorities are still trying to confirm the source of the hospital cluster. The hospital has disinfected and temporarily closed the ward where case 34 was treated from [14 to 28 Feb 2020] before being confirmed as infected with COVID-19. Patients who stayed in the ward with case 34 have been moved to isolation rooms, he added.

Meanwhile, the CECC said aside from 1 death, 12 of the total 42 confirmed COVID-19 cases have already fully recovered and left hospital.

[Nosocomial transmissions have been significant events in the epidemiology of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It is also appearing with the SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19. It is time for the global health care profession to stress the importance of using PPE [personal protective equipment] when confronting patients with febrile respiratory illnesses and not rely on second-guessing who may be infected and who may not be infected. These clusters are not unique to Taiwan; there are clusters in South Korea, in the USA, in Japan, in Italy, to name a few countries. - Mod.MPP]

Of the more than 120 cases of novel coronavirus in the United States, at least 21 of them are in the Seattle area [Washington state], according to King County health officials. That total includes 9 people who have died and others who have gotten sick at a nursing care facility in Kirkland. It is unclear whether it includes a person who works for Amazon in a downtown office building. According to a company email for staff members in Seattle and Bellevue, the employee infected with the novel coronavirus became ill [25 Feb 2020] and has not been to work since then. The company said it notified coworkers who had been in close contact with the patient. The worker was based at an office building the company refers to as Amazon Brazil, according to the email.

[Washington] has had at least 27 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 7 of which were King County cases announced on Tuesday [3 Mar 2020]. 8 of those who died were from King County, and one was from Snohomish County, county officials said. At least 6 of the patients died at EvergreenHealth in Kirkland, where some federal health experts are being sent.

Dr Robert Kadlec, the assistant secretary of preparedness and response for the US Department of Health and Human Services, described to a US Senate committee the type of experts he was hoping to send across the country. "We're looking to employ and deploy some of our national disaster medical system personnel as well as other federal health care personnel to assist at the Evergreen long-term treatment facility," he said.

At the nursing home, a Life Care Center in Kirkland, which county officials say was home to at least 9 of the patients who came down with coronavirus, more than 50 residents and staff members were experiencing symptoms and were tested for the virus, King County health officer Jeffrey Duchin said on Monday [2 Mar 2020]. "Current residents and associates continue to be monitored closely, specifically for an elevated temperature, cough and/or shortness of breath," executive director Ellie Basham said in a statement on the Life Care website. "Any resident displaying these symptoms is placed in isolation. Associates are screened prior to beginning work and upon leaving."

A North Carolina resident who visited the facility and returned to the Raleigh area is now in isolation at home after a test indicated the person has coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] should confirm the result in the next few days, officials said.

A US Department of Homeland Security facility in King County was shut down on Tuesday [3 Mar 2020] after officials learned an employee had visited a relative at Life Care, acting Homeland Security secretary Chad Wolf said during a House hearing.

The situation has residents frightened, US senator Patty Murray said during the Senate hearing, expressing concerns about testing protocol and the length of time it takes to get results. "I'm hearing from people who are sick, who want to get tested, (who) are not being told where to go," she said. "I'm hearing that even when people do get tested -- and it's very few so far -- that results are taking way longer to get back to them."

As many as 1 million tests for coronavirus could be administered by the end of week, the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] said, as cases across the United States rose to more than 100 and health officials warned the number will keep climbing. More than 120 cases of the virus have now been reported in 13 states -- with many of the patients in California and Washington. Cases have also been detected in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin.

About a quarter of the current cases were likely transmitted through US communities, officials have said, meaning they were not travel-related. "My concern is as the next week or 2 or 3 go by, we're going to see a lot more community-related cases," Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a news conference on Monday [2 Mar 2020]. "That's of great concern." The number of cases has been on the rise as new guidelines from health officials gave more labs the go-ahead to conduct tests. Faulty kits from CDC initially led to delayed and inconclusive results.

Over the weekend [29 Feb-1 Mar 2020], the FDA further expanded who could test for the virus by allowing additional labs to develop their own tests for the virus. The move, FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn said, would enable academic centers and private companies to develop and use tests. "We believe this policy strikes the right balance during this public health emergency," Hahn said in a statement. "We will continue to help to ensure sound science prior to clinical testing and follow-up with the critical independent review from the FDA, while quickly expanding testing capabilities in the US." With more labs testing for the virus, CDC stopped publishing the number of patients tested in the country -- a figure it had kept track of on its website. "Now that states are testing and reporting their own results, CDC's numbers may not represent all of the testing being done nationwide," the agency said in a Tuesday [3 Mar 2020] email.

Meanwhile, state and health officials maintain there is no need to panic. "We've seen an increase of cases in the United States over the weekend," surgeon general Jerome Adams said Monday [3 Mar 2020]. "I want folks to understand that we knew this was coming, we told folks that this was going to happen and it is why we've been preaching preparedness from the very start." He added, "Caution is appropriate. Preparedness is appropriate. Panic is not."

Of the 124 cases, at least 45 are repatriated residents from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which docked in Japan last month [February 2020] after an outbreak. More than 120 evacuees from the ship saw their scheduled Monday [2 Mar 2020] release from quarantine at Texas' Lackland Air Force Base delayed until Tuesday [3 Mar 2020]. Those who have shown no symptoms of coronavirus will be released on Tuesday [3 Mar 2020] "in an orderly way to minimize potential exposure to the San Antonio community," local health officials said.

So far, 25 cases of the virus have been reported in California, including the 1st one in the city of Berkeley. The resident, who returned to the city [23 Feb 2020], was concerned about being exposed through travel and stayed home in a self-imposed quarantine, according to a news release from the city.

Orange County has 2 people whose positive tests need to be confirmed by CDC. They are a woman in her 30s and a man in his 60s. They traveled to countries with widespread transmission, the Orange County Health Care Agency said. "The more you look for something, the more likely you are to find it," said Dr Nichole Quick, county health officer. "Now that our Public Health Laboratory is able to perform COVID-19 testing, we expect to see more cases here in Orange County."

In Northern California, 2 more cases were confirmed on Monday [2 Mar 2020], according to Santa Clara County Public Health Department, bringing the county's total to 11.

[The USA is seeking and the USA is finding. Now that there are more testing capabilities in the hands of the states, they have loosened their criteria for testing to a clinically compatible presentation, in addition to those with known contacts of confirmed cases and known travel to areas with known transmission. Yes, there is community transmission, but hopefully this recognition will lead to implementation of control measures. As mentioned in yesterday's post (20200303.7042402), strict quarantine or isolation measures is a challenge in a society that puts personal freedoms high on societal norms. - Mod.MPP

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 am CET.

Highlights
----------
- Eight member states (Andorra, Jordan, Latvia, Morocco, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, and Tunisia) reported cases of COVID-19 for the first time in the past 24 hours.

- The increase of COVID-19 cases in the Eastern Mediterranean Region is of great concern. The WHO regional director of the Eastern Mediterranean region reiterated the need to enhance surveillance and response activities, and share critical information, as being essential to containing the outbreak and strengthening health systems. More information can be found at http://www.emro.who.int/media/news/statement-by-the-regional-director-dr-ahmed-al-mandhari-on-covid-19-in-the-eastern-mediterranean.html.

- The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is implementing a comprehensive plan to support country preparedness and containment efforts for COVID-19. Barbados was one of the 1st Caribbean countries to acquire test kits and reagents for COVID-19 detection, and receive training on how to use them. More information can be found at https://www.paho.org/en/stories/paho-prepares-barbados-covid-19-testing.

- Real-time training is critical for effective preparedness and response. WHO has several COVID-19 online resources for health professionals, decision-makers, and the public in multiple languages. Please see the COVID-19 courses on OpenWHO at https://openwho.org/channels/covid-19.

*Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
**Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of sentinel samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

***Cases identified on a cruise ship currently in Japanese territorial waters.
****310 female / 416 male / 9840 unknown. 34 healthcare workers (9 female / 13 male / 12 unknown).

Erratum: transmission classification for the Dominican Republic, Israel, and Sweden have been corrected.

[The number of countries reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 72. This includes 9 countries from the Western Pacific region, 34 countries from the European region, 5 countries from the Southeast Asia region, 15 countries from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 countries from the Americas region, and 3 countries from the African region. 30 countries are listed as having local transmission within their countries. There has also been local transmission noted on the cruise ship quarantined in Japan (the Diamond Princess).

The total number of cases reported from outside of China is now 10 566 including 166 deaths.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. - Mod.MPP]
