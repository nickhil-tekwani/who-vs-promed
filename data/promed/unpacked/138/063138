The epidemic curve for rabies in the Chelyabinsk Oblast is going up
continuously. Since the beginning of the year [2008], 11 foci of infection
have been recorded, according to the Chelyabinsk Oblast department of
Roselkhoznadzor (agency for control of agricultural and farm production).
The years 2005 and 2006 were relatively favorable in the south Urals, but
last year's [2007] statistics were worse, with 142 laboratory confirmed
cases reported in 101 settlements. Rabies is spreading in foxes, but dogs,
cats, and farm animals are also involved. A total of 16 000 people suffered
animal bites during the past year, and 3000 of them received vaccination
against rabies. 300 to 500 people had to be admitted to hospitals for
medical care.

Roselkhoznadzor officials have declared that the most radical and effective
way of prevention is the culling of wild carnivores in their natural
habitats and the rounding up and destruction of stray dogs and cats. The
vaccination and revaccination of domestic and farm animals by the oblast
veterinary service must also play a major role in rabies control.

The rabies situation in the Kaluga Oblast is alarming. So far, 24 cases of
animal rabies have been recorded, including cases in a cow and an elk.
Quarantine measures are being imposed frequently. During the whole of 2007,
only 23 animal cases were recorded, whereas at the present time, the annual
"norm" has been exceeded. In the current year [2008], rabies has been
reported in 9 regions of the oblast and in the surroundings of Kaluga.
Alexandr Ovsyannikov, the local Rospotrebnadzor expert said that the main
source of the infections are foxes, but pets and domestic animals get the
infection as well. A total of 65 people who had been in contact with rabid
animals are receiving vaccination. In all areas where rabies has been
detected, quarantine measures are in force. The most recent animal cases
were 2 hunting dogs (Husky breed) reported on 13 Feb 2008.

A 10 year old girl who was admitted at the beginning of February 2008 to a
hospital in Ugledar in the Donetsk Oblast with a diagnosis of rabies died
on 11 Feb 2008. Galina Kolomiytseva, director of the dangerous pathogens
unit of the Donetsk regional public health department, stated that the girl
had been treated for 2 weeks in the intensive care unit. The final
diagnosis will be available after the pathology studies have been
completed. She also added that the cat, which was the source of the
infection, had not been identified, as it was a stray. She commented that
if a search had been carried out immediately, it might have been possible
to destroy the animal and [immediately confirm the diagnosis of rabies].

[Rabies is endemic throughout the length and breadth of Russia and in the
east of the Ukraine. These reports illustrate the magnitude of the problem
faced by the Russian authorities and the frequent failure of people to seek
medical treatment early enough for post-exposure vaccination to be effective.
