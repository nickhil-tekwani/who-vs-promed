Cow dung, widely used as a fuel and in rituals in India, is likely behind an epidemic of black fungus that killed or maimed thousands of patients treated in the country for COVID-19 in 2021, say medical researchers.

Mucormycosis, a dangerous infection caused by Mucorales fungi, has an overall mortality rate of 54%, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In May 2021, mucormycosis was declared an epidemic in India -- during a devastating 2nd wave of COVID-19 -- with the country accounting for 71% of all Mucorales infection cases worldwide.

The country had recorded 51 775 cases of mucormycosis as of November last year [2021]. Mucorales, a coprophilous (dung-loving) group of fungi, thrives on the excrement of herbivores and India has the world's largest population of bovine cattle, counting 300 million in its inventory.

The paper published April [2022] in mBio [see [2] below] a journal of the American Society for Microbiology, hypothesizes that "Mucorales-rich cow excrement, given its use in multiple Indian rituals and practices, especially during the pandemic, probably played a key role in India's COVID-19-associated mucormycosis [CAM] epidemic."

Jessy Skaria, an author of the paper and an independent researcher from Houston, Texas, tells SciDev.Net that the unusually high incidence of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis in India was attributed by most physicians and researchers to a combination of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection with diabetes and treatment using steroids. "However, since the same factors existed in other countries as well, we looked at unique local causes in India that could increase exposure to Mucorales spores, such as through fumes from burning cow dung," says Skaria. "Increased fungal spore burden in the Indian environment has been demonstrated in a recent multi-center study which showed the burden of Mucorales in areas close to hospitals to be as high as 51.8%." [Mucorales was actually reported to have grown from 21.7% hospital indoor and 53.8% outdoor air samples according to their reference 11. - Mod.ML]

Fungal spores disperse widely through the smoke of burning biomass, so the practice of burning mucorales-rich cow dung and crop stubble to dispose of it may lead to Mucorales spores being released into the environment, she explains. "This could potentially explain India's disproportionate case burden of mucormycosis at all times, even before the pandemic," says Skaria. She cited studies suggesting that Mucorales could be detected in 14% of patients in India's intensive care units and that an average of 65 500 deaths a year were attributable to mucormycosis. "Our hypothesis is also based on pioneering work that proved that fungal spores could travel long distances in smoke from biomass fires," she adds.

Cow excreta is a part of traditional life in India and used as an ingredient in many traditional ayurvedic medicines. Common rituals in parts of India include applying cow dung on bodies, drinking cow urine, and burning and inhaling cow dung fumes as a form of ritual purification during festivals, prayers, or cremations, the paper said.

Considered a sacred animal, cows are not slaughtered in many Indian states. "Notable exceptions are Kerala and West Bengal where the incidence of mucormycosis was far lower than in Maharashtra and Gujarat where the slaughter of cattle is strictly banned and where the use of cow excreta for fuels and rituals is popular," says Skaria. "It's hugely pertinent that in Kerala where there is no ban on slaughtering cows and no taboo on eating beef... and where cow dung is almost never used as fuel... the incidence of mucormycosis was found to be low."

During the COVID-19 pandemic, political and religious rhetoric inspired many Indians to liberally use cow dung and urine to prevent or treat COVID-19, including through mass fumigations with smoldering cow dung cakes, the paper observed. Similarly, in Iran an unusual spike in mucormycosis cases during the pandemic could potentially be attributed to the burning of donkey dung to produce "anbarnesa smoke", a traditional medicine, the paper said.

"To establish the role of herbivore dung in the causation of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis, case control studies, genetic (phylogenetic) studies, and other aerosol viability analysis of Mucorales spores, post-burning, is critical," Rodney Rohde, chair and professor of clinical laboratory science at Texas State University, tells SciDev.Net. "However, the hypothesis has strong support based on the epidemiological and case data that is occurring in India. The burning of cow dung is a possible vehicle for spore distribution and one that needs examining to help further the understanding of the ongoing and dangerously high prevalence of mucormycosis in India."

Judy Stone, a US-based infectious disease and clinical research specialist, tells SciDev.Net: "Exposure to Mucorales spores in cow dung is a very plausible hypothesis -- I think it is pretty clear that there is more to the mucormycosis epidemic than diabetes and steroids. Other countries (for example, China) have a much higher prevalence of diabetes, yet have not had the overwhelming numbers of patients with mucormycosis.

"I hope that this hypothesis, now embraced by academic physicians and published in a peer-reviewed journal, will finally prompt further study by aerobiologists and other scientists in India."

Abstract
--------
The exact cause of the disproportionate increase in COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM) cases in India remains unknown. Most researchers consider the major cause of India's CAM epidemic to be the conjunction of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated corticosteroid treatment with the enormous number of Indians with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, excess CAM cases were not seen to the same extent in the Western world, where diabetes is prevalent and corticosteroids are also used extensively for COVID-19 treatment. Herein, we hypothesize that previously overlooked environmental factors specific to India were important contributors to the country's CAM epidemic. Specifically, we propose that the spread of fungal spores, mainly through fumes generated from the burning of Mucorales-rich biomass, like cow dung and crop stubble, caused extensive environmental exposure in the context of a large population of highly vulnerable patients with DM and COVID-19. Testing this hypothesis with epidemiologic studies, phylogenetic analyses, and strategic environmental sampling may have implications for preventing future epidemics.

Opinion/hypothesis
------------------
"Compared with other countries, India has always had a disproportionate mucormycosis caseload (1), but why COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM) was seen in such large numbers and in so short a time span in only India remains somewhat unclear. The number of CAM cases in India increased sharply in late April 2021 (2), in conjunction with the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the government declared CAM an epidemic on 20 May [2021]. The number of cases in the country exceeded 41 000 by mid-July [2021] (3) and plateaued in August [2021]; currently, the country's average mucormycosis caseload is nearly the same as it was before the COVID-19 pandemic, albeit still significantly higher than the global average. In contrast, CAM remains relatively uncommon in other nations despite those countries' high prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and widespread use of corticosteroids for COVID-19 treatment, the factors most commonly cited as causes of the Indian epidemic (4-7). For instance, the prevalence of DM among adults is 13.6% in the United States, 13.0% in China, 10% in Germany, 8.6% in France, and 6.8% in the Netherlands but 8.3% in India (8). Although it does not have the highest prevalence of DM, India has 74.2 million adults with DM and another 39.4 million with undiagnosed DM and is, thus, second only to China in terms of people living with DM (8). Despite their unproven efficacy in non-hypoxic patients with COVID-19, corticosteroids are frequently used to treat patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 in other parts of the world as well (9, 10). This raises the question of whether excessive environmental exposure to Mucorales spores is the unacknowledged factor in India's CAM epidemic. One recent multicenter study from India showed that the Mucorales burden in the outdoor hospital environments in India is as high as 51.8% (11) [Mucorales was actually reported to have grown from 21.7% hospital indoor and 53.8% outdoor air samples according to their cited reference 11. - Mod.ML] Herein, we posit that important but overlooked cultural, religious, and social factors specific to India might be responsible for the excessive burden of fungal spores, including Mucorales spores, in the Indian environment. Specifically, we hypothesize that Mucorales-rich cow excrement, given its use in multiple Indian rituals and practices, especially during the pandemic, probably played a key role in India's CAM epidemic. We also posit that the dispersal of the fungal spores most likely occurs through fumes generated from the burning of Mucorales-rich biomass, such as cow dung and crop stubble. We believe that this dispersal likely resulted in a heavy load of Mucorales in and around vulnerable immunocompromised and diabetic COVID-19 patients, thus helping drive India's CAM epidemic (Fig. 1a)."

[Mucormycosis, also known as zygomycosis, are infections caused by fungi in the class Zygomycetes, composed of the orders Mucorales and Entomophthorales. The order Mucorales includes genera _Rhizopus_, _Rhizomucor_, _Mucor_, and _Cunninghamella_. These fungi are ubiquitous in the environment, found in soil and decaying vegetable matter. However, they are also found in the hospital environment, being isolated from nonsterile adhesive tape and tongue depressors, and being linked to nosocomial infections (1, 1a, 2). The clinical spectrum of mucormycosis ranges from cutaneous, rhino-orbital and rhino-orbito-cerebral, sinopulmonary, and disseminated infections, which are frequently fatal, especially in immunocompromised hosts.

Most human infections result from inhalation of fungal spores that have been released in the air or from direct inoculation of organisms into disrupted skin or mucosa. Although individuals are exposed to these fungi on a daily basis, usually only people with weakened immune systems or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus develop infections due to these organisms. However, contamination of devitalized tissue following traumatic injuries sustained during tornados, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions can result in mucormycosis even without underlying risk factors (3-5).

Nosocomial mucormycosis has been associated with a variety of healthcare-associated procedures or devices, such as cutaneous infection related to the direct inoculation of the fungus on the wound or skin surface, usually from contaminated wound bandages, contaminated karaya (a plant-derived adhesive used for ostomy bags), or contaminated medication patches. Mucormycosis has also followed the use of contaminated wooden tongue depressors to prepare oral medications given to patients through a nasogastric tube or to construct splints for intravenous and arterial cannulation sites, and aerosolized fungal spores in ventilatory systems as a result of construction (6). In another nosocomial outbreak, water damage to a linen store and patient shower room promoted fungal growth, which contaminated the surrounding air that circulated in close proximity to the infected patients' rooms (7). Nosocomial gastrointestinal mucormycosis has followed ingestion of contaminated food or medications.

These organisms characteristically are angioinvasive, often leading to thrombosis, infarction of involved tissues, septic embolization, and dissemination. Mucormycosis can have a rapid and often fatal clinical course. The diagnosis of mucormycosis almost always requires histopathologic evidence of fungal invasion of the tissues. Culturing these organisms from an infected site is rarely sufficient to establish the diagnosis because the fungus may colonize tissue without causing infection and is a relatively frequent laboratory contaminant.

Most cases of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM) have been reported from India, where it is said to be occurring in 0.27% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients (8-10). However, the prevalence of mucormycosis in India even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic was high, approximately 0.14 cases per 1000 population, about 80 times the prevalence in developed countries (https://www.mdpi.com/2309-608X/6/4/265/htm).

Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus is the most common risk factor among CAM patients and India is home to 77 million diabetics, 2nd highest to China with 116 million diabetics (https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/india-has-second-largest-number-of-people-with-diabetes/article29975027.ece), which may explain in part the high incidence of mucormycosis in India (diabetes mellitus being a major risk factor for mucormycosis).

However, a third of CAM cases are reported to have no underlying predisposition, other than COVID-19 (10). Severe COVID-19 is treated with high doses of steroids, and improper glucocorticoid use in COVID-19 (e.g., use of glucocorticoids in mild COVID-19 cases (without hypoxemia) or the utilization of higher than recommended doses of glucocorticoids) has been found to be additional risk factors for CAM in India (10).

Mucormycosis usually develops 10-14 days after hospitalization for severe COVID-19. Mucormycosis that presents before a diagnosis of COVID-19 is made appears unusual (11). Researchers hypothesize that the unusually high incidence of CAM in India is being caused by burning cow dung as fuel and in rituals unique to India, which they say releases fungal spores that then are inhaled to gain entry into the paranasal sinuses in these highly susceptible COVID-19 patients. Whether cow dung is the "missing link" in the pathogenesis of CAM awaits confirmation.
