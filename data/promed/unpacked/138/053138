Case of cat rabies raises concern
-------------------------------------
A case of rabies in a Bloomington house cat has the Quincy Humane Society
suggesting that all cat owners in Adams County get their pets vaccinated.
The Bloomington case, recently verified, is the 1st such case in Illinois
since 1996, according to the Illinois State Department of Health.
Historically, rabies outbreaks can follow distemper outbreaks. There was a
distemper outbreak in Illinois in 2004, said Sally Westerhoff, executive
director of the Quincy Humane Society. Rabies vaccinations are mandatory
for dogs. But Adams County is among the approximately 70 counties out of
102 in the state that does not require vaccinations for cats, said Ledy Van
Kavage, senior director of Regional Legislative Services for the National
Shelter Outreach, which is affiliated with the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
"There is no question cats should be required to be vaccinated, and why
they aren't, I do not know, but it is imperative they should be," said
veterinarian Drew Kaiser of Katherine Road Animal Hospital.
Kaiser said vaccinations for cats are equivalent to a low-cost insurance
policy. Annual vaccination for a cat normally costs between USD 12 and 20.
Van Kavage said cost is one of the reasons vaccination is not mandatory in
all counties. There are bills pending in both the Illinois House and Senate
that would help establish funds to assist low-income families with certain
animal treatments, including vaccinations.
"Cats should be vaccinated, even though some people have cats who never go
outside," Westerhoff said. "The cat in Bloomington was never outside and
never had been vaccinated."
The cat was bitten by a bat that had gotten into the house. An elderly
couple owned the cat. "The cat had been ill for several weeks, was seen by
a veterinarian and was initially diagnosed with liver disease," Westerhoff
said. "The couple was told to feed the cat, so there was a lot of mucus
membrane exposure to the couple, and the woman sustained a bite." Medical
treatment for the bite from the rabid cat will cost the couple USD 1500 each.
Rabies is a viral disease of the central nervous system and is one of the
oldest and most feared diseases reported in medical literature. Untreated,
rabies causes a painful death. In addition, the cat must be euthanized or
quarantined for 6 months. If it had been vaccinated, the quarantine would
have been only 45 days.
"Getting people to make sure their pets are vaccinated will also help keep
themselves and their children safe," Westerhoff said. She said 55 percent
of pets in the United States are now cats. And there are countless feral
cats that run wild which are even more susceptible to rabies bites from
bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, deer, large rodents and other animals. "Kids
should never mess with sick or wounded animals," Van Kavage said.
The 1st sign of rabies is usually a change in the animal's behavior. Other
signs include difficulty walking, general appearance of sickness or change
in the animal's normal behavior. An animal does not need to be "foaming at
the mouth" to have rabies.
Human infection can happen through a bite, scratch or saliva from an
infected animal. Infection can also come through contact with the animal's
mucous membranes (nose, mouth, eyes).

[Something is slightly off in this article. Rabies is a neurological
disease. The health department confirmed the cat had rabies. In order for
the health department to confirm the animal had the disease, it had to
examine the brain. In order to examine the brain the cat had to be dead.
The article states: "Untreated, rabies causes a painful death. In addition,
the cat must be euthanized or quarantined for 6 months. If it had been
vaccinated, the quarantine would have been only 45 days." If the cat had
rabies, it was euthanized in order for its brain to be tested. If a cat is
exposed but unvaccinated, it then may be quarantined for 6 months, whereas
a vaccinated cat would only be quarantined for 45 days. Exposed animals may
also be euthanized. The statement in the article was a little confusing by
not explaining that more fully. It should also be pointed out that there is
no treatment for rabies in cats as of this writing.
Cats should be vaccinated, regardless of their indoor/outdoor status. Many
states have enacted rules or legislation that requires that cats be
vaccinated with a 3-year vaccine once every 3 years. The rationale for this
requirement was that some cats suffer vaccine-related sarcomas which may
prove fatal to the cat. Although vaccine-related sarcomas are not pleasant,
it is better than exposing one's family to rabies. Vaccinating cats with a
3-year vaccine once every 3 years has reduced the rate of vaccine-related
sarcomas.
Rabies is a deadly disease, but it can present in several forms, one of
which is a change in behavior. Animals may become either aggressive or
withdrawn. Some may appear lethargic and ill, but are not recognized as
having a behavior change. Also, other diseases present in the animal, such
as liver disease, may confuse the diagnosis.
Since the couple was most likely exposed, I would hope the county health
department would be contacting them with regard to Post Exposure
Prophalaxis. - Mod.TG]
