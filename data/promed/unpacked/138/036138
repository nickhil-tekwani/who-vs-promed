Reported cases of pertussis are at their highest level in 50 years, a top official with the CDC said Thursday, 19 Jul 2012, adding that outbreaks in several states should encourage all children and adults to get vaccinated.

Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said doctors across the nation have reported more than 18 000 cases of pertussis so far in 2012. That is more than twice as many cases as there were at this time in 2011 and the 1st time since 1959 that so many cases have been reported by this time in the year.

Pertussis, or whooping cough, is a bacterial infection involving the respiratory tract that is easily spread by coughing and sneezing. It can start out like the common cold, but can be a very serious infection, particularly for infants under the age of one, who are too young to complete the full vaccination series.

While some doctors say that part of the surge in reported cases can be credited to better diagnostic tests and increased awareness, the casualties thus far underscore a very real problem. Nine infants have died from pertussis so far in 2012 in the USA. The 13-to-14-year-old age group has been hit particularly hard. In Washington State, the number of cases this year [2012] has surpassed 3000, already more than 3 times as many as all of 2011. Washington state Secretary of Health Mary Selecky declared a statewide pertussis epidemic on 3 Apr 2012.

The vaccine for pertussis, known as DTaP, should be given to all children as a series at ages 2, 4, and 6 months, 15-18 months, and 4-6 years, according to the CDC. An additional booster, known as TDaP, is needed at age 11-12.

"Unvaccinated kids are at 8 times higher risk for getting pertussis compared to kids who have been vaccinated," said Schuchat. "Vaccinated kids who do develop pertussis have a milder course. They're also less infectious than unvaccinated children."

Health officials added that all adults who have not been vaccinated against pertussis should receive the TDaP vaccine, especially pregnant women and those who will have contact with babies. Pertussis outbreaks generally occur in peaks and waves. Even with vaccination, immunity tends to wane over time.

An estimated 84 percent of toddlers in the USA have received their complete course of vaccination. However, only 8 percent of adults are currently vaccinated. "Our biggest work is to get adults immunized," said Dr. Mark Sawyer, chairman of the CDC's pertussis work group and professor of pediatrics at UCSD. "This is particularly relevant to pregnant women and new grandparents, who will have contact with infants."

What's unusual is the fact that so many 13- and 14-year-olds are falling ill with the infection. The CDC is looking into whether this could be attributed to a change implemented in 1997 that saw the vaccine used to immunize children change from a version that was taken off the market in the USA because of possible neurologic side effects.

The CDC is launching an investigation to find out what is contributing to the unusual features of this outbreak. Researchers are also looking at why the protection offered from the current vaccine is not complete.

Dr. Gregory Poland of the Mayo Clinic has had personal experience with pertussis, not only as a physician, but also as a father of a child who suffered through pertussis at the age of 13 despite being fully vaccinated. "When I 1st heard my son cough, I knew he had pertussis," Poland said. "Even though I treated him immediately, the cough lasted for 100 days. He literally kept the family awake for months."

Dr. Len Horovitz, an infectious disease specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, is frustrated that despite the prevalence of media coverage, adults are not requesting the vaccine. "How much relentless coverage and repetition of medical information [does it take] for the public to finally grasp an epidemic?" he asked. "People aren't listening, aren't watching, or aren't paying attention."

North Dakota health officials also are seeing a spike in cases of whooping cough, said Abbi Pierce, immunization surveillance coordinator in the Division of Disease Control, North Dakota Department of Health. So far in 2012, North Dakota has more cases of whooping cough than were reported in all of 2011. As of 23 Jul 2012, the health department has received reports of 79 cases, already surpassing 2011's total of 70.

North Dakota is in sync with the national trend of sharply escalating numbers of whooping cough cases that is causing serious concern among health care professionals.

"Several states are reporting incredibly high numbers of cases this year [2012]," Pierce said. In North Dakota, "we're experiencing higher levels of cases but nowhere near the levels they're seeing in Minnesota and Washington State," she said.

North Dakota's highest number of whooping cough cases, 757, was recorded in 2004, Pierce said.

The number of whooping cough cases has tripled in New York, and Sen. Charles Schumer is calling on health officials to provide free vaccinations.

On Sunday [22 Jul 2012], the senator urged the federal government to work with health officials in every state to make sure adults get vaccinated for free if they haven't been since age 18. He points out the cough is very contagious and especially dangerous if transmitted to young children.

This could be the worst year for whooping cough in this country in a half century, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So far this year [2012], 1288 cases have been reported in New York state, 3 times the number from 2011. There have been 187 cases in New York City and 333 on Long Island.

Maryland health officials say it appears whooping cough is on the rise. Kurt Seetoo, senior epidemiologist with the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said in 2011 there were 123 cases of the disease. In 2012, from 1 Jan 2012 to 30 Jun 2012, there have already been 133," Seetoo said of the preliminary numbers.

Seetoo said anyone who has contact with an infant should get immunized to prevent transmitting whooping cough. Family members, including grandparents, should get the booster, known as TDaP.

According to the DPHHS Communicable Disease Weekly Update (20 Jul 2012), so far in 2012, there have been 355 cases of pertussis in Montana, compared to 66 cases for the same period in 2011.

With school and athletics beginning soon, DPHHS is encouraging healthcare providers, schools, and sports teams to be aware of our continuing outbreak and consider the recommendations outlined on the attached information sheet.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Hector I. Ojeda-Martinez for contributing this post. - Mod.LL

In previous postings on pertussis, ProMED has highlighted research by both Dr Frits R Mooi from the Netherlands (Pertussis - Australia (04): newly emerging clones, discussion 20120322.1078115) and Dr Lyn Gilbert from Australia (Pertussis - Australia (03): newly emerging clones 20120321.1076103) that has been reflecting antigenic changes in circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, which may be causing the increased number of pertussis cases throughout the world. A recent in-press paper from the CDC (1) has also addressed these antigenic changes and also found the predominance of the fim3B allele but concluded that: "The changes in vaccine composition and schedule were not the direct selection pressures that resulted in allele changes present in the current _B. pertussis_ population."

Another recent paper from the CDC (2) discusses the apparent quicker wane in immunity against pertussis with the acellular vaccine and potential options, including an intranasal, live, attenuated _B. pertussis_ strain (3).
