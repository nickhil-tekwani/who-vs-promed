[1] UK: CJD surveillance as of Mon 6 Aug 2012
Date: Mon 6 Aug 2012
Source: UK National CJD Surveillance Unit, monthly statistics [edited]
http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/figures.htm


The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD as of Mon 6 Aug 2012 remains 176. No definite/probable patient remains alive, so the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and alive) remains 176.

The overall picture remains consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the UK is in decline, albeit now with a pronounced tail. The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, one in 2008, 3 in 2009, 3 in 2010, 5 in 2011, and none so far in 2012.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in 2012
---------------------------------------------------
During 2012 so far [as of 6 Aug 2012], there have been 58 referrals, 38 fatal cases of sporadic CJD, one case of GSS [Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease], 3 cases of familial CJD, no cases of vCJD or of iatrogenic CJD.

Since records began in 1990, there have been 2946 referrals, 1345 fatal cases of sporadic CJD, 176 cases of vCJD, 97 cases of familial CJD, 68 cases of iatrogenic CJD, and 47 cases of GSS.

A new case (the 27th) of Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in France
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A new case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [vCJD], the human form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy [BSE] has been diagnosed in France. The case is a 27-year-old under person who has been under observation since 1996. vCJD is associated with the consumption of bovine neural and other tissues. VCJD has now been diagnosed in 27 people in France. This case is the 2nd recorded in France during 2012. Both vCJD cases identified in France in 2012 remain alive, whereas the 25 cases diagnosed previously have all died.

[In June 2012 a new case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), was identified in France, being the 26th case since 1996, and the 1st new case for 3 years. Of these 26 probable or confirmed cases of vCJD in France (12 men and 14 women), all except the most recent case have died.

The 25 fatal cases prior to this year occurred in 1996 (1 case), 2000 (1 case), 2001 (1 case), 2002 (3 cases), 2004 (2 cases) 2005 (6 cases) in 2006 (6 cases), in 2007 (3 cases), and 2009 (2 cases). The median age at death or diagnosis was 37 years (ranging from 19 to 58 years). Of these 26 victims, 8 patients lived in the Ile-de-France and 18 in the provinces. One victim had regularly resided in the UK during a 10-year period since 1987.

For those interested, the Table of the Total Number and Distribution of Human vCJD Cases, worldwide, has been updated now to include these 2 new French cases and is available at http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/vcjdworld.htm.

[3] UK: incidence of vCJD, 1994-2011, statistical analysis
Date: Mon 2 Jul 2012

Incidence of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease diagnoses and deaths in the UK -- January 1994-December 2011 (statistical analysis)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary: In 2011 there were 2 new diagnoses of vCJD and 5 deaths. One of the new diagnoses related to a death in 2008. This brings the total number of cases reported in the UK to 176, who have all died.

Results from modelling the underlying incidence of diagnoses and deaths indicate that the epidemic reached a peak in about the year 2000 when there were 27 diagnoses and 28 deaths and has since declined to a current incidence of about 1 to 2 diagnoses/death per year. There is evidence that the epidemic curve is skewed with an extended tail. Looking at onsets shows similar results with evidence of an extended tail.

An analysis that looked at deaths by birth cohort (pre 1970, 1970s, 1980s) showed that the shape of the epidemic differs between cohorts, mainly due to the fact that deaths of individuals born in the 1980s were only seen from 1999 onwards.

It is important to note that although a peak in cases has been passed, it is possible that there will be future peaks, possibly in other genetic groups. To date, however, there is no evidence of a 2nd wave.

There is also the possibility of ongoing person to person spread as seen with 4 cases of transfusion association vCJD infection to date, who received blood in 1999 or earlier from donors who were later diagnosed with clinical vCJD. 3 of these individuals developed vCJD (one diagnosed in 2003 and 2 in 2006), whilst the 4th died from causes unrelated to vCJD, but was found on post mortem examination to have abnormal prion protein present in the spleen and a lymph node.

1. Introduction
---------------
Each year data on diagnosed cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in the UK are reviewed in order to investigate trends in the underlying rate at which deaths and diagnoses are occurring. The present report reviews the data for all individuals who had been classified as definite or probable cases by the end of December 2011.

2. Background information
-------------------------
Definite cases are those confirmed neuropathologically. To date all probable cases for which neuropathological data have become available have subsequently been confirmed as definite. The date of diagnosis is taken as the date when diagnosed as probable or, when this is not available, the date of confirmation of a definite case.

For these analyses we have included all cases notified to the National CJD Research & Surveillance Unit and classified as definite or probable by the end of December 2011 (Table 1).

2011 / 0 / 2 / 2 / 5 / 26
Total / 176 / 176 / 176 / 176 / 28
*3 cases have arisen to date who had a blood transfusion from earlier cases. These cases, who were all male, died (were diagnosed) in 2003 (2003), 2006 (2006), and 2007 (2006). These cases are included in the analyses although are likely to part of secondary spread.

3. Methods
----------
The incidence of deaths, diagnoses, and onsets was modelled by Poisson regression using polynomials. Most deaths and diagnoses are reported quickly so an adjustment for reporting delay is not necessary. For onsets 2011 is not included. The age at death has not increased as may have been expected, assuming that most exposure to BSE ceased in the early 1990s. In order to examine this further the cases were stratified by year of death and birth cohort (pre1970, 1970s, and 1980s). Trends in deaths over time were compared between these cohorts.

4. Results for diagnoses
------------------------
A quadratic trend model provides a good fit to the data (figure 1 [available at the source URL above]), however there was evidence (p less than 0.01) that a cubic model, which would give a longer tail to the epidemic, fitted better. This is due to the positive skew in the epidemic curve (long tail). The peak is estimated to have occurred mid 2000.

5. Results for deaths
---------------------
A quadratic trend model provides a good fit to the data (figure 2 [available at the source URL above]) , however there was evidence (p less than 0.01) that a cubic model fitted better. This is due to the positive skew in the data. The peak is estimated to have occurred in mid 2000.

The epidemic curves vary significantly (p less than 0.001) by birth cohort. The main difference is due to the fact that in the 1980s cohort no deaths were seen prior to 1999 (figure 3 [available at the source URL above]). This finding is consistent with those born in the 1980s being infected towards the end of the BSE epidemic when they were older rather than at the beginning. This requires a lower exposure/susceptibility in the very young, which is reasonable because no cases have been seen to date in individuals born in the 1990s.

6. Results for onsets
---------------------
[In modelling onsets for 1993-2010, the cubic model also gives a better fit (p=0.001), although neither has a very good fit. The cubic model is better in the tails (at the start and end) and the quadratic model better around the peak. Both models predict a low current incidence of onsets (0 for quadratic and 2 for cubic).

[4] UK: behavioral and psychiatric symptoms

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Behavioural and psychiatric symptoms (BPS) are major features of the prion diseases with a great impact on patients and carers, but up to now have been subjected to very little systematic clinical research. We have prospectively studied 368 patients, providing an unprecedented opportunity to study these symptoms across the range of prion disease types. The prevalence of BPS was high in all disease types, ranging from 70 percent in inherited prion disease due to PRNP [prion protein gene] point mutation (IPD-point) to 96 percent in variant CJD (vCJD). Prevalence at the onset of disease was more variable, ranging from 24 percent (IPD-point) to 92 percent (vCJD). We describe the clinical characteristics and natural history of the commonly occurring symptoms. Observational clinical data on 189 courses of symptomatic drug treatment shows that use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors was reported to be beneficial in a substantial proportion of patients (between 15 percent and 60 percent) and that no severe adverse events were reported.

We show that specific disease types and PRNP codon 129 genotypes independently predict the presence of psychotic symptoms and the presence of BPS at disease onset, suggesting that prion strain is largely responsible for the heterogeneity seen in these clinical features. However, we also show that, in sporadic CJD, younger age at onset independently predicts the presence of BPS at onset. We discuss the implications of these findings both for clinical practice and for our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying the complex symptoms of prion disease.

[5] USA (SC): brain surgery alert
Date: Wed 1 Aug 2012
Source: Fox 29 News, South Carolina [summ., edited]
http://www.wflx.com/story/19164044/11-upstate-brain-surgery-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-disease


Eleven Upstate brain surgery patients were put at risk for acquiring a fatal brain disease that affects only one in a million. The Greenville Hospital System (GHS) said they've told patients who were operated on in February [2012] that the same tools used for their surgeries were used on a patient doctors later found had Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD. In a statement, GHS said they always clean their tools according to US standards, but they didn't use the additional CJD sterilization because they hadn't known until later that one of their patients had it.

The release said they have since told each of the 11 who had surgeries in February, who may have been exposed. One of the patients has been a nursing home, barely able to communicate. Her husband says he's nervous, because he has no idea how anyone would know if his wife got the disease through surgery. He spoke with doctors on 13 Jul 2012 and then received a letter describing what they had discussed in brief. "Please know that the Greenville Hospital System stands ready to provide her with all reasonable and appropriate treatment, at no cost to you, if she is diagnosed by biopsy with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease," the letter read. The victim's husband said he's still not heard back from the hospital and doesn't know much of what is going on, aside from what he researched online. "Already I'm worried about what happened the 1st time, and now they throw this on top," he said.

CJD is like a very fast-acting dementia. It causes the brain to shut down, which eventually leads to a body shutdown. The National Institutes of Health, NIH, said it happens most often in people over 65. NIH said it's caused by an abnormal protein and usually [occurs] sporadically. Sometimes it's genetic, and fewer than one percent of cases are acquired, like this would be, if someone gets it. That concept of rare possibility is what GHS stressed in its letter to the husband.

In GHS's release, Dr Thomas Diller, vice president of quality and patient safety, said, "This is a very unusual event. After a full assessment and discussion with the CDC, we believe the risk of transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease to any patient is extremely small." Biopsies and autopsies are the only way to know for sure if someone has it, but there may be symptoms everything from a change in the way someone walks to confusion, hallucinations, muscle stiffness or twitching, and sleepiness.

[6] UK (Northern Ireland): vCJD incidence
Date: Mon 16 Jul 2012
Source: Londonderry Sentinel [edited]
http://www.londonderrysentinel.co.uk/news/local/six-mad-cow-deaths-1-4036219


The human variant of 'mad cow disease' was mentioned on 6 Northern Ireland death certificates over the past 3 years, the Finance Minister Sammy Wilson has revealed. The Minister provided details of the number of deaths registered in Northern Ireland between 2009 and 2011, where 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease' was mentioned on the death certificate.

Mr Wilson's colleague the Health Minister Edwin Poots said that of 176 deaths from [variant] Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease across the UK since 1995, just 3 had occurred in Northern Ireland. Mr Poots said none of the 3 deaths were due to blood transfusions and that it was impossible to say for sure if the 3 local deaths were due to the consumption of infected beef products.

"None of the 3 deaths in Northern Ireland was associated with blood transfusions. While there is good, although indirect, evidence that variant CJD originated from transmission of infection from bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle to humans via infectivity in food, the source of infection in 3 cases in Northern Ireland is not known," he added.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We describe an atypical neuropathological phenotype of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) in a 64-year-old man presenting with a 5-month history of rapidly progressive dementia, comprising behavioral disturbances, memory complaints, disorientation, and language alterations. MRI showed diffuse atrophy and hyperintensities in parietal, occipital, temporal, and frontal cortices and left caudate nucleus on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. No typical EEG alterations were observed. Repeated 14-3-3 assay was positive after a 1st negative test. Neuropathology showed classical CJD changes with small cortical foci of large confluent vacuoles and relatively well-preserved cerebellar cortex. The most striking feature was the presence of abundant Kuru-type plaques in both cerebral cortex and subcortical white matter. Sparse Kuru-type plaques were also seen in cerebellum, although only in white matter. Immunohistochemistry showed, in addition to unicentric plaques, diffuse synaptic and patchy perivacuolar, as well as plaque-like and periaxonal pathological prion protein deposits (PrPres). Western blot studies demonstrated the co-occurrence of PrPres types 1 and 2 in frontal cortex and a relatively weak type 2 signal in cerebellum. PRNP genotyping revealed methionine homozygosity at codon 129 and excluded mutations. This case shows a previously undescribed combination of histopathological features which preclude its classification according to the current phenotypic and molecular sCJD classification. The observation demonstrates that Kuru-type amyloid plaques mainly involving the cerebral white matter may also occur in sCJD cases with short clinical course and the co-existence of PrPres types 1 and 2. This case further highlights the complexity of the correlations between histopathological phenotype and PrPres isotype in prion diseases.

[The statistical analyses of the vCJD outbreak in the UK described in part [3] concluded that the peak in cases has passed and that there is no evidence of a 2nd wave of cases. It remains possible that there will be future peaks, possibly in other genetic groups. However, the conclusion that there is no evidence of a 2nd wave of cases has been placed in doubt now, by the identification of 2 new cases of vCJD in France after a gap of 3 years. Indeed the somewhat extended tail of cases in the UK may be a forewarning of a 2nd wave of vCJD cases with longer incubation periods. - Mod.CP]
