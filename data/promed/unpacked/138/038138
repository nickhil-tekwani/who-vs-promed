An outbreak of infection with _Bacillus anthracis_ in injecting drug users
in Scotland
--------------------------------------------------
An investigation is currently under way to explore and control an outbreak
of _Bacillus anthracis_ [infection] among drug users (mainly injecting) in
Scotland. Contaminated heroin or a contaminated cutting agent mixed with
the heroin is considered to be the most likely source and vehicle of
infection. Heroin users have been advised of the risk. The risk to the
general public is regarded as very low.

Progress of investigation
-------------------------
Given the confirmation of cases outside the Glasgow conurbation, the
outbreak investigation has now been upgraded to a national OCT [outbreak
control team], coordinated by Health Protection Scotland. Representatives
of agencies working with drug users have also been co-opted to the national
OCT including the Scottish Drugs Forum and Scottish Drug Deaths Forum. The
most likely cause of the outbreak is considered to be exposure by injection
(or other routes) to heroin either directly contaminated at the source or
contaminated as a result of mixing with other substances contaminated with
anthrax at some point in the supply chain. The distribution of cases
suggests either that small batches of contaminated heroin may still be
circulating in Scotland or that there is a continuing source of
contamination in material used to cut (dilute down) the heroin before
supply to end users. Further investigations are proceeding to try to trace
the supply network and validate the existing hypothesis.

Risk assessments have been undertaken regarding the potential risks to
others including health service staff, police and others involved in
searching premises and in handling the cases and belongings. To date, there
has been no evidence to suggest a risk to the general public or any other
parties who have had access to clothing, belongings or the living quarters
of cases. No special protective measures are, therefore, being advised at
present, and there are no plans to decontaminate any such personal items or
premises, on the basis that the risk to date has been confined to an
association with personal intake of heroin, not other casual exposures.

Discussion
----------
Although rare, outbreaks or cases of illness among injecting drug users
(IDUs) have been documented in recent years. In 2000, an outbreak among
IDUs, involving 60 cases and 20 deaths, occurred in Scotland. The most
frequently isolated pathogen among the cases was _Clostridium novyi_, and
transmission was believed to have occurred via a contaminated batch of
heroin [2,3]. Similarly in 2000, a case of injectional anthrax was
identified in a heroin-injecting drug user in Norway. A contaminated batch
of heroin was believed to be the source of the infection [4].

Between December 2003 and April 2004, reports of _C. hystoliticum_ from 12
cases of infection in IDUs were identified in England and Scotland. Again,
it was believed that the source of the infection was a contaminated batch
of heroin distributed across the UK [5].

Setting an appropriate diagnostic threshold for this outbreak is a
challenge in that about 34 per cent of IDUs per year report signs of an
infected injection site. Hence, wound infections in this population are not
unusual. However, none of the cases have presented with a classical
cutaneous anthrax pattern. It is perhaps surprising given the source and
nature of heroin preparation and anecdotal reports that heroin is
transported in animal skins that more cases of infections in heroin users
has not been identified before now.

Fife police have seized more than GBP 10 000 [USD 16 300] of heroin dumped
in Inverkeithing after an anonymous tip-off from a local resident. The
force acted on information that there was a suspicious number of packages
located on open ground in Inverkeithing and moved to recover the items. The
incident occurred last Friday afternoon, and the force is currently
investigating how the drugs came to be in the location and who they belong too.

Head of South West Fife Villages CID, DI Derek McEwan, said, "Thankfully
these drugs were able to be removed from circulation prior to exposing any
member of the public, whether it be adult or child, to the hazards of
coming into contact or taking this particular type of drug. I would
emphasise to any member of the public who believes they know the
whereabouts of any controlled drugs or persons involved in that drug trade
to contact Fife police, as we are committed to reducing the harm caused by
illegal drugs."

current batches available, by clients, or maybe just cannot shift it. It
will be interesting to see what impact the news release on the results of
microbiological testing of these dumped drugs will have. - Mod.MHJ]

The French health ministry issued a warning on Tuesday [19 Jan 2010] after
8 people died and [a further] 7 fell sick in 2 European countries from
using heroin contaminated by anthrax. "Since 6 Dec 2010, there have been 15
confirmed cases of anthrax among heroin users, 14 in Scotland and one in
Germany," the ministry's General Directorate for Health (DGS) said in a
statement. "Eight people died," it said. "The likeliest source is heroin
contaminated by anthrax spores." Most of the casualties had injected the
heroin, but others also inhaled it or smoked it.

The ministry said the contaminated drug may also be circulating in France
and other European countries. "There is no outward sign or colour enabling
the user to tell whether the heroin has been contaminated by anthrax, and
contaminated heroin dissolves or is used in the same way as uncontaminated
heroin," it said.
