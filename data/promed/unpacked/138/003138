Ebola in Uganda
---------------
The Ministry of Health (MoH) of Uganda has notified WHO of an outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Kibaale district in the western part of the country.

A total of 20 cases, including 14 deaths have been reported since the beginning of July 2012. The index case was identified in a family from Nyanswiga village, Nyamarunda sub-county of Kibaale district, where 9 of the deaths were recorded. The deceased include a clinical officer who attended to a patient, and her 4-month-old child. 9 of the 14 deaths have occurred in a single household. Laboratory confirmation was done by the Uganda Virus Research Institute in Entebbe.

Currently, 2 patients are hospitalized and are in stable condition. The 1st is a 38-year-old female who attended to her sister, the clinical officer who died. She was admitted to the hospital on 26 Jul 2012. The 2nd is a 30-year-old female who participated in conducting the burial of the index case. She was admitted to the hospital on 23 Jul 2012. Both cases were admitted to hospital with fever, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Neither of the cases has so far shown bleeding, a symptom that often appears in viral haemorrhagic fever patients.

The MoH is working with stakeholders and partners to control the outbreak. Response plans at the national and district levels are being finalised. A national task force coordinated by the MoH has been re-activated at the MoH headquarters and holds daily meetings. In Kibaale a district task force has been formed to better coordinate field response. The neighbouring districts have been put on high alert about the outbreak and to step up surveillance.

A team of experts from MoH, WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is in Kibaale to support the response operations. All possible contacts that were exposed to the suspected and confirmed cases since 6 Jul 2012 are being identified for active follow up. The necessary supplies and/or supportive management of patients are being mobilized.

Kibaale hospital has established a temporary isolation ward for suspected, probable and confirmed cases. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Holland, has mobilized necessary requirements for setting up isolation centre at the hospital. The MoH and Mulago Hospital have mobilized some staff to manage the isolation centre but more are urgently needed.

The MoH has advised the public to take measures to avert the spread of the disease and to report any suspected patient to the nearest health unit.

WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions are applied to Uganda.

[Other Information and comments extracted from current press reports and commentators:
- A total of 7 doctors and 13 health workers at Mulago hospital are in quarantine after "at least one or 2 cases" were taken there, with one later dying from the virus. (From The Standard, Mon 30 Jul 2012
http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking_news_detail.asp?id=22335&icid=4&d_str=20120730).
- A number of schools in Buyaga County have been closed following the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Kibaale district. There are 5 types of Ebola namely Ebola Zaire, Ebola Sudan, Ebola Cote d'Ivoire, Ebola Bundibugyo and Ebola Reston. The type confirmed in Kibaale is Ebola Sudan, which is less deadly than Ebola Zaire. When Ebola Sudan broke out in Gulu in 2000, about 4 out of every 10 patients were able to recover. On the contrary, Ebola Zaire inevitably kills most of the people who get it. (From New Vision, Mon 30 Jul 2012 <New Vision,Uganda

- The species of Ebolavirus responsible for the current Uganda outbreak has been identified as Sudan ebolavirus since early Saturday. The earliest mention that I can find currently is here:
http://www.sfgate.com/world/article/Deadly-Ebola-outbreak-kills-14-in-Uganda-3743722.php. They either overstate the average case fatality rate for that species, or are syntactically ambiguous. Sudan ebolavirus has a case fatality rate closer to 55% (see Field's Virology). This article has a more thorough discussion and more accurate case fatality rates:

- CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said Sunday that: "About 5 people from the Atlanta-based centers were expected to join a group of CDC staffers who are permanently based in Uganda. These outbreaks have a tendency to sort of stamp themselves out, if you will, if we can get in and sort of stop the chain of transmission," he said. Health Minister Dr. Christine Ondoa Ondoa described the Ebola-Sudan strain detected as "mild" compared to other types of Ebola, noting that victims' lives can be saved with intervention.

- A total of 7 doctors and 13 health workers at Mulago hospital are in quarantine after "at least one or 2 cases" were taken there, with one later dying from the virus. The latest outbreak started in Uganda's western Kibaale district, around 200 kilometres (125 miles) west of the Kampala, and around 50 kilometres from the border with Democratic Republic of Congo.
