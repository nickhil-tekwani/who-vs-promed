A woman who died mysteriously in Fiji along with her partner sent a series of text messages to her mother in which she revealed her hands had gone "numb" and that she was going to the doctor.

MP and DP died 2 days apart after arriving for a "dream" holiday to the South Pacific nation on 22 May 2019 and becoming ill soon after.

Fiji's health ministry has been working with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organisation to investigate what could have caused the seemingly healthy couple to become gravely ill.

Text messages sent to MP's mother in the United States and obtained by ABC News document how the pair's condition worsened.

"We are both going to doctor now," the 35-year-old texted her parents, who live in Nevada, soon after she and her husband arrived in Fiji.

We have been throwing up for 8 hours. DP has diarrhoea. My hands are numb. We will text when we can," she wrote.

Later that day, she texted her mother to update her on their condition. "We just got back from the clinic," she said. "They gave us fluids and anti-nausea drip. They gave us electrolyte packets and anti-nausea pills. We still don't feel 100 per cent. Going to rest in our room," she said.

MP's mother, responded: "Take care ... Drink a lot of fluid, bottled water. You need to rest."

MP died on 25 May 2019 and her 37-year-old husband passed away 2 days later. Fiji's health ministry said in a statement an investigation into the cause of death is ongoing.

"Influenza has been ruled out, and at this stage, we do not believe there is a risk to the public," the statement said.

[Vomiting for 8 hours, diarrhea, dehydration numbness and scant details. There is no mention of an odd smell, as in the cases in the Dominican Republic (see archive 20190609.6511612). Nevertheless, I would want to rule out organophosphates (OP). I would like to know what they had to eat or drink and if something harmful was slipped to them or some contaminated seafood was consumed?

The mnemonic used for the toxidrome or toxic syndrome in organophosphate (OP) toxicity or poisoning is SLUDGE, which stands for salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastric cramps, emesis (vomiting) symptoms. However, several other clinical signs and symptoms may be present.

I hope the investigation will help find where they were exposed to OP's or some other toxin if that is what this couple died of, or if not, the cause of death. - Mod.TG
