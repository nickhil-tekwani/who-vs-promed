The health minister [Brian Chituwo] announced Tuesday [27 Nov 2007]
that 4 people have died and 20 others were put under quarantine
following the outbreak of an unknown disease in southern Zambia.

Brian Chituwo said the government has dispatched medical experts to
investigate the cause of the disease and assess the situation in
Namwala, a small town in the southern province of Zambia.

"The 4 died before the medical team arrived in the area," Chituwo
said. The 20 patients have been quarantined in an effort to contain
the spread of the disease, which has symptoms of vomiting and
backache, the minister said.

Chituwo said the disease was detected last Sunday [?25 Nov 2007] by
local medical practitioners following the death of the 4 patients.

[Speculation on a differential diagnosis with the symptoms given
above -- vomiting and backache -- is a "fun" challenge. Checking the
possible list of infectious agents that would produce the clinical
spectrum of a cluster of severe, fatal infections associated with
vomiting and backache in Zambia using the GIDEON (Global infectious
disease and epidemiology network) database
(<http://www.gideononline.com>), comes up with a list of the
following possible diagnoses (and probability of occurrence) -- which
includes viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases:

Rift Valley fever (30.8 percent probability), leptospirosis (27.5
percent), influenza (2.4 percent), malaria (11.5 percent), meningitis
-- bacterial (9.2 percent), relapsing fever (3.2 percent), septicemia
--bacterial (1.8 percent), legionellosis (1.4 percent). Other
diseases mentioned with a less than one percent probability include:
typhoid and enteric fever, _Bunyaviridae_ infections -- misc.,
rabies, tuberculosis, typhus -- endemic, _Streptococcus suis_
infection, yellow fever, trypanosomiasis -- African, Q-fever,
brucellosis, yersiniosis, ornithosis, trichinosis, infectious
mononucleosis or EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) infection, poliomyelitis,
toxoplasmosis.

Even more fun is the possible list of other diseases that might
produce the same type of cluster, but anywhere in the world (not
necessarily seen in Zambia at present). This list (according to the
GIDEON network would include: hantavirus infections -- Old World,
Ebola, Lassa fever, typhus -- scrub, dengue, hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever to mention a few.

In the see also section below one can find a listing of prior
disease/outbreak related ProMED-mail postings from Zambia, going back
to 1995. Human and zoonotic diseases reported on ProMED-mail in this
period include: anthrax, cholera, rabies, plague, suspected Ebola
virus infection (a cluster of 3 suspected cases that were ultimately
diagnosed as schistosomiasis, gum disease, and pneumonia), measles,
polio, and undiagnosed deaths without any further information on the
clinical presentation of these undiagnosed deaths. There were also 2
undiagnosed veterinary outbreaks -- one involving bovines, one
involving wild birds. All of these prior reported outbreaks could
produce clusters of illness that might be associated with vomiting
and backaches as well.

The process of speculation on possible etiologic agents for this
above-mentioned outbreak would be even more "fun" if there were more
information available from knowledgeable sources in the region --
such as the age distribution of cases, possible common exposures,
other symptoms associated with the illness, and information on the
animal health in the surrounding region to help rule in or rule out
the possibility of a zoonotic disease outbreak. ProMED-mail would be
grateful to receive more information from knowledgeable sources.

Namwala can be seen in the northern part of the Southern Province in
