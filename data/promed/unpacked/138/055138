The deaths of thousands of chickens in the last 2 weeks have raised
public fears of avian influenza virus in Kupang, although local
authorities have said the deaths weren't related to the virus. The
true cause is still under investigation.

The head of the animal health unit of the East Nusa Tenggara
Husbandry Agency, Maria Geong, said Tuesday [6 Nov 2007] that 7000
chickens had died in Kupang in the last 2 weeks.

"Preliminary investigations suggest the chickens died of Newcastle
disease or chronic respiratory disease," she added.

The office sent specimens of dead poultry to 2 different
laboratories, the state-run Veterinary Diseases Investigation Office
and Udayana University's Biomedic Laboratory. Both are located in
Denpasar, Bali and are capable of detecting the avian influenza virus.

Previously, the East Nusa Tenggara Health Office confirmed it had
found avian influenza in chicken samples taken from 13 regencies
across East Nusa Tenggara.
