The latest word from Armenia, from Armenian colleagues who are involved in public health, is that 4 of the animals that tested positive for _Bacillus anthracis_ were [previously] vaccinated. This is probably nothing special but might hint that something is not right, either with the vaccine, the vaccination schedule, or the records.

[Tamas has been involved in projects in Armenia for some time now, so we can regard his comment as having some weight. If our Armenian readers can flesh out this preliminary information, it would be of value to us all.

While livestock vaccination with Sterne and its new Russian equivalent are normally very effective, not all vaccines in use are as good. And some like the Argentine vaccines consistently under-perform for reasons which defy investigation. A common cause of under-performance is when cows are receiving mastitis treatment when vaccinated with a competent vaccine; remember it is a live vaccine and is antibiotic-sensitive. So when one has an outbreak in the face of vaccination, it is well worthwhile investigating what might have gone wrong, whether it is the vaccine's fault, animal management, faulty animal immunogenesis, just a duff batch of vaccine, or the commonest everyday cause: the farmer had failed to vaccinate the batch of animals that came down, either through laziness, lack of funds, or that they were recently bought, and he hadn't got around to doing it yet. - Mod.MHJ
