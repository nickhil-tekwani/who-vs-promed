Low Levels of Influenza Activity in Europe and the First
B/Shanghai//361/2002-like Viruses Detected in Norway
--------------------------------------------------------

Summary
-------
Influenza activity has continued to decrease throughout Europe, and only 2
countries reported any regional activity. 10 percent of virological
specimens collected this week were positive for influenza. 2
B/Shanghai/361/2002-like viruses have been isolated in Norway (these are
the first reported in Europe this winter). Among the sub-typed viruses,
A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2)-like viruses remains predominant.

Epidemiological and virological situation
-----------------------------------------
Regional activity (i.e. activity above baseline levels in one or more
regions comprising less than 50 percent of the country's population) was
reported in Germany and Italy. Sporadic activity was reported by 12
networks and no influenza activity by 8. Activity further decreased in the
East of Europe and remained around baseline levels in other parts of Europe.

The total number of respiratory specimens collected by sentinel physicians
in week 10/2004 was 358; 35 (9.8 percent of total) were positive for
influenza virus. Of the 49 detected influenza viruses (35 sentinel and 14
non-sentinel), 22 influenza A viruses were not subtyped and 26 were H3 [5
of these were A(H3N2)]. Influenza B was detected once. Influenza A(H3) was
predominant in 2 networks, influenza A(H3N2) in 2 and influenza A not
subtyped in 3. 12 networks did not report a dominant (sub)type.

Based on the (sub)typing data of all influenza virus detections up to week
10/2004 (N=12567; sentinel and non-sentinel data), 8222 were A unsubtyped,
4227 were A(H3) [2910 of these were A(H3N2)], 32 were A(H1) [14 of these
were A(H1N1) and 8 A(H1N2)] and 86 were B.

Based on the characterisation data of all influenza virus detections up to
week 10/2004 (N=12 567), 2226 (18 percent) have been antigenically and/or
genetically characterised; 1895 (85 percent) were A/Fujian/411/2002
(H3N2)-like, 298 (14 percent) were A/Moscow/10/99 (H3N2)-like, the
haemagglutinins of 26 A(H1) isolates [one of these was A(H1N1) and 13 were
A(H1N2] were A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)-like, 3 were
B/Sichuan/379/99-like, 2 were B/Hong Kong/330/2001-like and 2 were
B/Shanghai/361/2002-like. The predominant viruses recently circulating in
most countries were A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2)-like.

Comment
-------
Levels of influenza like illness were generally low throughout Europe. Most
of the networks reported declined or unchanged levels of influenza
activity. The first B/Shanghai/361/2002-like viruses have been reported by
Norway. This virus is recommended to be used in the influenza vaccine for
the 2004-2005 season. The predominant virus circulating in Europe remains
influenza A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2)-like.

[While Influenza A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2)-like viruses remain predominant
in the European region, influenza A viruses of H1N1 and H1N2 antigenic
types were also present. The most significant report is the first isolation
of influenza B/Shanghai/361/2002-like viruses in the European region for
the first time this winter. - Mod.CP]
