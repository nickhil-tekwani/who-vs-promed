New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Ubsu-Nur, Ovyursky, Respublika Tyva [Tuva]
Date of start of the outbreak: 9 Jun 2016
Outbreak status: resolved 15 Jun 2016
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Grey Heron: _Ardea cinerea_ (Ardeidae) / - / 4 / 0 / 4 / 0
Great crested grebe: _Podiceps cristatus_ (Podicipedidae) / - / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Black-headed gull: _Larus ridibundus_ (Laridae) / - / 6 / 0 / 6 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species
Epidemiological comments: during the active monitoring of the ornithofauna in the surroundings of Ubsu-Nur Lake, a few wild birds were shot. Genome of H5 avian influenza virus was detected in 17 samples from carcasses of birds [black-headed gull (_Larus ridibundus_), grey heron (_Ardea cinerea_), common tern (_Sterna hirundo_), great crested grebe (_Podiceps cristatus_), great cormorant (_Phalacrocorax carbo_), duck (_Anatidae_). Sequence analysis of the isolates showed that they belonged to the Asian HPAI virus H5 lineage A/Guangdong/1/96, clade 2.3.4.4.

Control measures
Measures applied: control of wildlife reservoirs, screening, no vaccination, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

[It is noteworthy the variety of aquatic bird types in which HPAI H5 virus was detected; namely gull, heron, duck, tern, cormorant, and grebe.

Ubsu-Nur lake is a huge wetland that congregates a great abundance and diversity of aquatic birds. It is a stopover site for migratory birds using the central Asian flyway, which covers a large continental area of Eurasia between the Arctic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. This flyway comprises several important migration routes of waterbirds that migrate over immense distances, and therefore the finding of this HPAI H5 virus in so many species here is of concern for a vast territory.
