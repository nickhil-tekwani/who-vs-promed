MERS situation update, May 2018
-------------------------------
Highlights
- At the end of May 2018, a total of 2220 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), including 790 associated deaths (case-fatality rate: 35.6 percent) were reported globally; the majority of these cases were reported from Saudi Arabia (1844 cases, including 716 related deaths with a case-fatality rate of 38.8 percent). During the month of May [2018], a total of 12 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS were reported globally: 11 cases in Saudi Arabia including 1 associated death and 1 case reported in United Arab Emirates.

- A household cluster of 8 laboratory-confirmed MERS cases was reported in Najran Region during the last week of May [2018]. Apart from the index case -- who had history of contact with camels and also consumed raw camel milk before he was diagnosed --, none of the remaining 7 cases in this cluster had any history of contact with camels. The index case had a date of onset of symptoms on [17 May 2018] and by [31 May 2018], 7 symptomatic [secondary] cases were reported from this cluster. More cases are expected to be reported from this cluster as the close contacts are being followed up and the laboratory test results of some of the close contacts are awaiting.

- The demographic and epidemiological characteristics of reported cases, when compared during the same corresponding period of 2013 to 2018, do not show any significant difference or change. Owing to improved infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, the number of hospital-acquired cases of MERS has dropped significantly since 2015.

- The age group of 50-59 years continues to be at highest risk for acquiring infection of primary cases. The age group 30-39 years is most at risk for [secondary] cases. The number of deaths is higher in the age group 50-59 years for [primary] cases and 70-79 years for [secondary] cases."

[ProMED-mail would like to thank our Rapportuer Mary Marshall for sending a NewsScan report by CIDRAP flagging the update contained in the EMRO/WHO Situation Report above (http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/06/news-scan-jun-11-2018).

According to the tally on my spreadsheet, there were a total of 12 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported in Saudi Arabia during the month of May 2018, and 1 case reported by the UAE. Of the 12 cases reported by Saudi Arabia, 8 were associated with the Najran outbreak - the index case and 7 additional household contact cases and there was 1 additional primary community-acquired case reported (presumably with no direct known high risk exposures during the incubation period). The remaining 3 cases came from Sakaka (Al Jawf region), Hufoof (Ash Sharqiyah - Eastern region), and Tabuk (Tabuk region); 2 with a history of direct exposure to camels, and 1 with no high risk exposure identified (the case from Sakaka in Al Jawf region). The reported case from the UAE, in addition to having a camel farm with almost daily contact with camels, also had a history of travel to Saudi Arabia in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.

Information on the 8 cases associated with the Najran household cluster and the additional primary case was provided by the Saudi Ministry of Public Health. The latest report we have received was posted on ProMED-mail on 2 Jun 2018 and contained information on an additional 3 cases associated with the household cluster bringing the total number of cases associated with that cluster to 11. Recent rumor chatter in the media has suggested there were healthcare workers that were infected, but there has not been confirmation of this as yet.

For those who are interested in the Epidemiologic picture of MERS-CoV, I strongly recommend going to the original Situation Update where there are useful graphics and tables providing information on the known epidemiology of the disease based on the cases reported to WHO. A dynamic map showing a time series of the cumulative geographic distribution of MERS-CoV by country reported cases/infections can be found at: http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/map-20-april-2018.GIF?ua=1. - Mod.MPP
