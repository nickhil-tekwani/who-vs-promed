An enigmatic disease is raging in the department of Dianra in northwestern Cote d'Ivoire in the Bere region, especially in Yeretiele, where there have been 30 deaths since July 2019.

According to Blaise Kouadio Kouakou, a nurse at the Dianra Urban Health Center, "I was on leave last week and one of my colleagues informed me that he was receiving patients with edema (swelling) of the face, upper and lower limbs. When I returned on Tuesday [20 Aug 2019], I determined the facts. Indeed, it is going on in a single village, where there have been more than 30 [fatal] cases already. This is Yeretiele, located about 30 km [18.6 mi] from Dianra. All patients who come from this village have the same symptoms. We informed our departmental director of the Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene who came to see."

[The director stated]: "Upon the analysis of the facts, we do not know its origin, but we thought that it was related to herbicides that they used in the fields. However, the majority of the patients questioned refute this hypothesis. They say that they have never been in contact with these products this year [2019]. They consume only water from village pumps. So far, we do not know the origin of the malady," he observed his throat choking.

"We are therefore waiting for the results from the sample testing to better help the population. There are already several [fatal] cases in the department, including a case this Wednesday [21 Aug 2019] at the hospital. On Tuesday [20 Aug 2019], there was one [fatal] case from Dalagbe. Recently there was a death in Gbatosso, located 1.5 km [.93 mi] from Dianra, a case in Kansokoura, 2 cases in Fassonguikaha etc.," laments the nurse.

According to a resident of Linguvdougou, a village 2 km [1.2 mi] from Dianra, "the population is traumatized by this pandemic that continues to rage in our department. Here we recorded 3 deaths. Once in the hospital, the patient dies at 48 hours."

"They say that initially the edema is not accompanied by pain. It is only in the terminal phase that the person feels some pain and breathing becomes difficult. There is no diarrhea. We ask the population to come to the hospital at the 1st signs even if we do not have the appropriate treatment for now," invited Kouadio Kouakou.

A mysterious disease rages in a locality in the Ivory Coast, causing 30 deaths. The outbreak started in July 2019. But up until now, the health authorities do not know the nature of this disease. Symptoms found in the disease include facial and lower limb edema, chest pain, abdominal bloating, general fatigue, constipation and vomiting.

There is no mention of fever or bleeding, which could exclude an emerging or re-emerging viral disease. In all cases, caution must be exercised and the health authorities must make every effort to diagnose the pathology involved. There have already been 30 deaths since July (2019). No avenue should be left unexplored. Any information that can support the situation would be welcome. - Mod.BM

Although the original article was published more than 2 weeks ago on 21 Aug 2019, there has been very little if any further news on this outbreak. ProMED would appreciate any information regarding this outbreak, including additional cases, clinical details and laboratory results, and insights into the differential diagnosis and possible etiologies. - Mod.LXL
