[1] Plastic barriers
Date: Thu 19 Aug 2021

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/19/well/live/coronavirus-restaurants-classrooms-salons.html


COVID precautions have turned many parts of our world into a giant salad bar, with plastic barriers separating salesclerks from shoppers, dividing customers at nail salons and shielding students from their classmates. Intuition tells us a plastic shield would be protective against germs. But scientists who study aerosols, air flow and ventilation say that much of the time, the barriers don't help and probably give people a false sense of security. And sometimes the barriers can make things worse.

Research suggests that in some instances, a barrier protecting a clerk behind a checkout counter may redirect the germs to another worker or customer. Rows of clear plastic shields, like those you might find in a nail salon or classroom, can also impede normal air flow and ventilation.

Under normal conditions in stores, classrooms and offices, exhaled breath particles disperse, carried by air currents and, depending on the ventilation system, are replaced by fresh air roughly every 15 to 30 minutes. But erecting plastic barriers can change air flow in a room, disrupt normal ventilation and create "dead zones," where viral aerosol particles can build up and become highly concentrated.

"If you have a forest of barriers in a classroom, it's going to interfere with proper ventilation of that room," said Linsey Marr, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech and one of the world's leading experts on viral transmission. "Everybody's aerosols are going to be trapped and stuck there and building up, and they will end up spreading beyond your own desk."

There are some situations in which the clear shields might be protective, but it depends on a number of variables. The barriers can stop big droplets ejected during coughs and sneezes from splattering on others, which is why buffets and salad bars often are equipped with transparent sneeze guards above the food.

But COVID-19 spreads largely through unseen aerosol particles. While there isn't much real-world research on the impact of transparent barriers and the risk of disease, scientists in the United States and Britain have begun to study the issue, and the findings are not reassuring.

A study published in June [2021] and led by researchers from Johns Hopkins, for example, showed that desk screens in classrooms were associated with an increased risk of coronavirus infection (https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6546/1092). In a Massachusetts school district, researchers found that plexiglass dividers with side walls in the main office were impeding air flow (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.20.21253976v1.full.pdf). A study looking at schools in Georgia found that desk barriers had little effect on the spread of the coronavirus compared with ventilation improvements and masking (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7021e1.htm).

Before the pandemic, a study published in 2014 found that office cubicle dividers were among the factors that may have contributed to disease transmission during a tuberculosis outbreak in Australia (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.5694/mja12.11750).

British researchers have conducted modeling studies simulating what happens when a person on one side of a barrier -- like a customer in a store -- exhales particles while speaking or coughing under various ventilation conditions. The screen is more effective when the person coughs because the larger particles have greater momentum and hit the barrier. But when a person speaks, the screen doesn't trap the exhaled particles -- which just float around it. While the store clerk may avoid an immediate and direct hit, the particles are still in the room, posing a risk to the clerk and others who may inhale the contaminated air (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emg-role-of-screens-and-barriers-in-mitigating-covid-19-transmission-1-july-2021).

"We have shown this effect of blocking larger particles, but also that the smaller aerosols travel over the screen and become mixed in the room air within about 5 minutes," said Catherine Noakes, professor of environmental engineering for buildings at the University of Leeds in England. "This means if people are interacting for more than a few minutes, they would likely be exposed to the virus regardless of the screen."

Dr. Noakes said erecting barriers may seem like a good idea but can have unintended consequences. She conducted a study published in 2013 that looked at the effect of partitions between beds in hospitals. The study showed that while some people were protected from germs, the partitions funneled the air in the room toward others (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360132313000851).

So while a worker behind a transparent barrier might be spared some of the customer's germs, a worker nearby or customers in line could still be exposed. Dr. Noakes said most screens she has seen are "poorly positioned and are unlikely to be of much benefit."

"I think this may be a particular problem in places like classrooms where people are present for longer periods of time," Dr. Noakes said. "Large numbers of individual screens impede the airflow and create pockets of higher and lower risk that are hard to identify."

To understand why screens often have little effect on protecting people from aerosol particles, it helps to think about exhaled breath like a plume of cigarette smoke, Dr. Marr said. "One way to think about plastic barriers is that they are good for blocking things like spitballs but ineffective for things like cigarette smoke," Dr. Marr said. "The smoke simply drifts around them, so they will give the person on the other side a little more time before being exposed to the smoke. Meanwhile, people on the same side with the smoker will be exposed to more smoke, since the barriers trap it on that side until it has a chance to mix throughout the space."

Most researchers say the screens most likely help in very specific situations. A bus driver, for instance, shielded from the public by a floor-to-ceiling barrier is probably protected from inhaling much of what passengers are exhaling. A bank cashier behind a wall of glass or a clerk checking in patients in a doctor's office may be at least partly protected by a barrier.

A study by researchers with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in Cincinnati tested different sized transparent barriers in an isolation room using a cough simulator. The study, which hasn't yet been peer-reviewed, found that under the right conditions, taller shields, above "cough height," stopped about 70% of the particles from reaching the particle counter on the other side, which is where the store or salon worker would be sitting or standing (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.26.21261146v1.full.pdf).

But the study's authors noted the limitations of the research, particularly that the experiment was conducted under highly controlled conditions. The experiment took place in an isolation room with consistent ventilation rates that didn't "accurately reflect all real-world situations," the report said.

The study didn't consider that workers and customers move around, that other people could be in the room breathing the redirected particles and that many stores and classrooms have several stations with acrylic barriers, not just one, that impede normal air flow.

While further research is needed to determine the effect of adding transparent shields around school or office desks, all the aerosol experts interviewed agreed that desk shields were unlikely to help and were likely to interfere with the normal ventilation of the room. Depending on the conditions, the plastic shields could cause viral particles to accumulate in the room.

"If there are aerosol particles in the classroom air, those shields around students won't protect them," said Richard Corsi, the incoming dean of engineering at the University of California, Davis. "Depending on the air flow conditions in the room, you can get a downdraft into those little spaces that you're now confined in and cause particles to concentrate in your space."

Aerosol scientists say schools and workplaces should focus on encouraging workers and eligible students to be vaccinated, improving ventilation, adding HEPA air filtering machines when needed and imposing mask requirements -- all of which are proven ways to reduce virus transmission.

The problem, experts say, is that most people in charge of erecting barriers in offices, restaurants, nail salons and schools are not doing so with the assistance of engineering experts who can evaluate air flow and ventilation for each room.

People shouldn't panic when they see transparent barriers, but they shouldn't view them as fully protective, either. Workers and students who have transparent shields around them should continue to wear a mask to lower risk, Dr. Corsi said.

"Air flow in rooms is pretty complicated," Dr. Corsi said. "Every room is different in terms of the arrangement of the furniture, the height of the walls and ceilings, the vents, where the bookshelves are. All of these things have a huge impact on the actual flow and air distribution in a room because every classroom or office space is different."

More hospitalization, complications for kids with COVID-19 than with flu
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hospitalization and respiratory complications were more frequent in children and adolescents with COVID-19 during the early months of the pandemic than in those diagnosed as having influenza in past flu seasons, an international team of researchers reported today [20 Aug 2021] in Pediatrics (https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2021/08/18/peds.2020-042929).

The multinational cohort study reviewed 19 databases in the United States, Germany, France, Spain, and South Korea for data on patients under the age of 18 with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 or a positive test result from SARS-CoV-2 from January through June 2020. The researchers described baseline demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, and outcomes, and included a cohort of children and adolescents diagnosed with influenza during the 2017-18 flu season for comparison.

A total of 242 158 children and adolescents with COVID-19, and 9769 hospitalized for COVID-19, were included in the study. Most of the hospitalizations were seen in children ages 0-4. Comorbidities including asthma, heart disease, obesity, cancer, chromosomal disorder, and congenital malformations were more common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients than in those diagnosed as having COVID-19. The most commonly observed symptoms were fever and cough. Hospitalization was observed in 0.3%-1.3% of the cohort, with undetectable 30-day fatality. Hypoxemia and pneumonia were the most common complications.

Comparison of outcomes in those with COVID-19 vs more than 2 million children diagnosed as having flu in 2017-18 showed that hospitalization was between 5-fold and 13-fold higher for COVID-19. Pneumonia and hypoxemia were more common for children and adolescents with COVID-19, as was multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), which was rare among both cohorts. Children with COVID-19 also presented with higher rates of breathing difficulty, loss of smell, and gastrointestinal symptoms than children with seasonal influenza.

"Overall, all outcomes were more frequent in children and adolescents with COVID-19 diagnosis than those with a diagnosis of seasonal influenza in 2017-2018, suggesting more severe disease prognosis in children with COVID-19 than influenza," the study authors write. "Future research is needed to characterize and determine the long-term outcomes of children and adolescents affected with COVID-19."

Survey shows health not at baseline one month after COVID hospitalization
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Almost 85% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized said they were not back to their pre-COVID health one month after discharge, and even short hospital stays were tied to prolonged symptoms, according to survey results published in the Journal of Hospital Medicine yesterday [19 Aug 2021] (https://www.journalofhospitalmedicine.com/jhospmed/article/244270/hospital-medicine/continuing-cardiopulmonary-symptoms-disability-and).

The researchers interviewed US adults hospitalized for COVID-19 a median of 47 days after their hospitalization, which took place from 24 Aug 2020 to 26 Jan 2021. Respondents were a median of 60 years old and stayed a median of 5 days. More than half (54.9%) reported new or worsened cardiopulmonary symptoms, 16% had new or increased oxygen use, and 52.8% had problems with daily living. Overall, 84.2% said their health was not what it was pre-COVID, and 16.8% said that on a scale of 0-100, with 100 being pre-COVID health, they were at 50 or less.

A longer hospital stay was associated with increased odds of cardiopulmonary issues, such as coughing, and it was also linked to disability (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.82 per additional week and 2.06, respectively). Women were twice as likely to have new cardiopulmonary symptoms (aOR, 2.24), while Black and Hispanic people were less likely to report new symptoms (aOR, 0.31 and 0.38, respectively).

About 77% of patients with a new disability were discharged without home services, which the researchers say could have had an impact on their health. "This isn't patients saying, 'I can't run quite as far as I used to.' This is them saying 'I can't walk, I can't cook, I can't shower.' The effects are devastating," said co-lead author C. Terri Hough, MD, in a University of Michigan (U of M) press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/925859). "Unfortunately, we saw this even among patients with quite short hospital stays."

The survey also looked at financial stressors post-hospitalization and found that 23% had used up their savings, 20% had to change their job or become unemployed, and 40% needed a loved one to take time off from work to look after them.

[Also from the U of M press release: "'There are few other national studies that have both details about the hospital stay and are continuing to ask for patient perspectives like we are.'

"'While much attention has focused on deaths from COVID, these findings highlight the long-term consequences in survivors of COVID-19 and shed light on the public health crisis resulting from the disability and economic loss among COVID survivors,' said James P. Kiley, PhD, director of NHLBI's Division of Lung Diseases." - Mod.LK]

Study highlights racial/ethnic disparities in excess deaths from COVID-19
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A study today [20 Aug 2021] in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports (MMWR) highlights high excess mortality from COVID-19 among racial and ethnic minorities in the United States (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7033a2.htm).

Using data from the National Vital Statistics System, US researchers assessed US excess mortality incidence rates (IRs) by race/ethnicity and age-group from 19 Dec 2019 through 2 Jan 2021. Among all racial/ethnic groups, excess mortality IRs were higher in those ages 65 and older (426.4-1033.5 excess deaths per 100 000 person-years) than in those ages 25 to 64 (30.2-221.1) and those 25 years of age and younger (2.9-14.1).

Among those under the age of 65, Blacks and American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) had the highest excess mortality IRs, while Black and Hispanic persons had the highest excess IRs among those 65 and older. Among Black and Hispanic persons ages 65 and over, more than 1000 excess deaths occurred per 100 000 person-years compared with the number of deaths expected to occur.

The findings also illustrate the changing impact of the pandemic over time for different subgroups. Among those aged 65 years and older, excess mortality IRs peaked from April to June 2020 for Black adults, while remaining consistently elevated among Hispanic adults, and increasing from April-June 2020 to October-December 2020 for AI/AN, non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander (NH/PI), and White adults.

"These findings underscore the disproportionate prevalence of excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 among racial/ethnic minority groups of all ages in the United States, which have been driven, in part, by factors such as occupational risk, socioeconomic factors, housing conditions, reduced access to health care, and discrimination," the authors write.

"Identifying factors that contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in mortality, either directly or indirectly attributable to COVID-19, can help guide tailored public health prevention strategies and equitable allocation of resources, including COVID-19 vaccination (see related CIDRAP news at https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/08/new-strategies-could-boost-covid-19-vaccination-underserved), to achieve greater health equity."

[3] Delta variant: breakthrough infections
Date: Fri 20 Aug 2021
Source: National Geographic [abridged, edited]
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/evidence-mounts-that-people-with-breakthrough-infections-can-spread-delta-easily


A preliminary study has shown that in the case of a breakthrough infection, the delta variant is able to grow in the noses of vaccinated people to the same degree as if they were not vaccinated at all (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.31.21261387v3). The virus that grows is just as infectious as that in unvaccinated people, meaning vaccinated people can transmit the virus and infect others.

Previous studies in hospitals in India; Provincetown, Massachusetts; and Finland have also shown that after vaccine breakthrough infections with delta, there can be high levels of virus in people's nose whether they are vaccinated or not (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.08.443253v5, https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm, https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.30.2100636).

The next logical step was to determine whether vaccinated people could shed infectious virus. Many experts suspected they did, but until this study it hadn't been proven in the lab.

"We're the first to demonstrate, as far as I'm aware, that infectious virus can be cultured from the fully vaccinated infections," says Kasen Riemersma, a virologist at University of Wisconsin who is one of the authors of the study.

"Delta is breaking through more preferentially after vaccines as compared to the non-delta variants" because it's extremely infectious and evades the immune response, says Ravindra Gupta, a microbiologist at University of Cambridge. Gupta's lab was one of the first to document that fully vaccinated healthcare workers could get infected with delta and had high levels of virus in their noses.

If the Wisconsin study finding holds up, then people with breakthrough infections -- many of whom do not develop COVID symptoms -- can unknowingly spread the virus. "It [is] an alarming finding," explains Katarina Grande, a public health supervisor and the COVID-19 Data Team Lead of Madison & Dane County, who led the study.

What concerns Eric Topol, the founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, is that fully vaccinated individuals who are infected with the delta variant can transmit the virus and this can happen at a higher rate than previous strains in the days before symptoms, or in the absence of symptoms. "Which is why masks and mitigation measures are important, even for people [who are] vaccinated," he says.

Studies like these highlight that transmission of the delta variant can be much higher [than] currently estimated, according to Ethan Berke, chief public health officer of the UnitedHealth Group. Berke's research has shown that frequent testing with rapid results, even if preliminary, can be very effective in curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic. Berke was not involved in the Wisconsin study.

"Even though the study was based on one region, it offers important insight into how people can spread the virus to others whether they're fully vaccinated or not. This sort of insight, especially as it's tested and refined, is incredibly helpful as organizations develop policies around testing, social distancing, and vaccinations," Berke says.

How do we know the virus in the sample is infectious? "SARS-CoV-2 virus infects nose and upper airway. It is very difficult to get a very high level of antibodies for long periods of time in that area. The immune system is not really designed to put high levels of antibodies at those sites," Gupta says.

The Wisconsin study analyzed the nasal swabs from 719 cases of unvaccinated and fully vaccinated people who had all tested positive and found that 68% of the studied breakthrough patients had very high viral loads. High viral load is a sign that the virus is replicating, Gupta says.

To discover whether the nasal swabs had infectious virus, the Wisconsin researchers grew virus from 55 patient samples (from both vaccinated and unvaccinated people who tested positive) in special cells prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Grande's team detected infectious virus in nearly everyone: from 88% of unvaccinated individuals and 95% of vaccinated people.

"We put the samples onto cells, and the cells died when they got infected. And so that clearly demonstrates that there is virus there, and that it's infectious," Riemersma explains. If vaccinated people can still produce a lot of infectious viruses, it means they can spread the virus as easily as those who are not vaccinated.

Masks and vaccination needed to prevent viral transmission: "We have kind of a perfect storm of multiple things going on: super-infectious variants, really susceptible population, debates around masking," Grande says.

More than 93.8% of the USA is at substantial or high level of risk for community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC defines an area to be at high risk when either the number of new cases in a county exceeds 100 per 100 000 persons, or more than 10% of COVID-19 tests come back positive in the past 7 days. In those areas, CDC recommends wearing a mask indoors in public to maximize protection from the delta variant and prevent spreading it to others.

Although authorized vaccines prevent severe COVID-19 and death, they offer substantially lower protection among older people, those with weakened immune system, or with an underlying medical condition.

"We need more information about the delta variant to better understand how it works, can be transmitted, and ultimately informs how we protect ourselves at home, work and within our communities," Berke says. "In the meantime, basic hygiene, including masking, social distancing, regular testing and vaccines will continue playing a vital role in slowing transmission and preventing serious illness and death."

Despite the marginal increase in daily cases, the 7-day average continues to fall. With Jharkhand's number yet to come, Thursday [19 Aug 2021] saw 36 599 cases and 543 deaths. The 7-day average of cases however was 34 445 which has been declining since 5 Aug 2021. Also, cases have not breached the 40k mark in the last 7 days.

The decline in cases was reflected in most states. Except for the marginal increase in A&N [Andaman and Nicobar] Islands, Gujarat, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Puducherry, for all states and UTs [Union Territories] cases reported on Thursday [20 Aug 2021] were lower than the previous week's case count.

The decline was highest in Maharashtra where this Thursday [19 Aug 2021] reported 1163 fewer cases as compared to the last Thursday [12 Aug 2021]. The count declined by 425 in Karnataka, 358 in Andhra Pradesh, and 329 in Kerala.

Overall, Kerala reported 21 116 cases which were the highest among states. With 197 deaths reported on Thursday [19 Aug 2021], Kerala's death toll was also the highest among states. It was followed by Maharashtra where 154 people succumbed. The toll was 68 for Odisha, 29 for Tamil Nadu, and 27 for Karnataka.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 20 Aug 2021 at 05:16 GMT:
Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 32 358 829 / 433 622 / 311
Bangladesh: 1 447 210 / 24 878/ 149
Pakistan: 1 116 886 / 24 783 / 110
Nepal: 742 228 / 10 429 / 351
Sri Lanka: 373 165 / 6790 / 316
Afghanistan: 152 448 / 7054 / 177
Maldives: 79 659 / 222 / 403
Bhutan: 2580 / 3 / 4

Over the last 7 days, 241 003, 50 342, 26 973, 16 459, 28 047, and 678 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan, respectively, compared with 261 069, 74 214, 31 508, 17 690, 23 689, and 1964 in the preceding 7 days, revealing a slowly decreasing trend in India, the continuation of the decreasing trend in Bangladesh over the last 2 weeks, a slightly decreasing trend in Pakistan, a stable trend in Nepal, a decreasing trend in Afghanistan, but the continuation of the development of a sharp peak of new cases in Sri Lanka.

Live Situational Analysis on COVID-19 cases in Sri Lanka can be seen at https://hpb.health.gov.lk/covid19-dashboard/.

A total of 1170 people died in Sri Lanka attributed to the disease over the last 7 days, with 186 deaths yesterday (19 Aug 2021). If such escalation of new cases and deaths continues, the possibility of imposing a country-wide lockdown again might be on consideration, to curb the spread of the delta variant in the country.

Although a decreasing trend of the disease was recorded last week compared with the trend of preceding week, the daily case-positivity rate is still quite high in Pakistan, around 7%, as indicated in item [4] above. Because the delta variant of the virus is active in the country, the possibility of seeing a reverse trend in the next week or so cannot be ruled out.

The daily-case positivity and number of deaths associated with COVID-19 in Bangladesh are dropping sustainably even after relaxing the lockdown measures. However, the current case positivity is around 18%, as indicated in item [1] above, much higher compared to other South Asian countries. The beginning of an increasing trend again cannot be ruled out due to full relaxation in lockdown measures from yesterday (19 Aug 2021). Not only by laboratory confirmed cases but also by number of total deaths so far reported due to COVID-19, Bangladesh is now in the 2nd position in South Asia overtaking Pakistan last week by number of total deaths.

There is no visible sign yet in India that the slow and steady decreasing trend of the disease would again turn into a new wave in the country. The rate of daily laboratory-confirmed cases across the country is rather sustainably decreasing. The total daily case counts remained below 40 000 for the 7 days of the last week, as indicated in item [2] above. Mass vaccination along with a high level of seroprevalence to the causative virus induced due to its natural transmission could play roles in such persistent decreasing-trends being observed. Cumulatively, 566 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered across India, with 5 505 075 doses being administered in the last 24 hours (19 Aug 2021) (https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-coronavirus-live-updates-over-25-000-covid-cases-in-24-hours-in-india-18-august-2021-2512886).
