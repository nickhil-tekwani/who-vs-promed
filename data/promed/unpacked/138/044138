A rapidly spreading fungal disease affecting bats has been discovered in Daniel Boone National Forest. The US Forest Service says white nose syndrome was found on hibernating bats in 6 caves inside the forest. Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources confirmed laboratory findings.

Some 5.7 million to 6.7 million bats have died since the disease was 1st detected in New York in 2006. It has since spread across the eastern United States as far west as Missouri and into Canada.

Forest biologist Sandra Kilpatrick says 38 bat hibernation caves were surveyed over the winter, with white nose syndrome found in 6. Those 6 caves are in Jackson, Rockcastle, and Pulaski counties.

No human illnesses have been attributed to white nose syndrome, although people are able to spread the fungus.

[This does not represent an expansion of the disease into another state but rather into another large and important part of the shrinking bat population.

More information regarding the expansion of this disease, and about the disease itself, may be found in ProMED-mail post 20130328.1608158 and other postings within the ProMED-mail archives.
