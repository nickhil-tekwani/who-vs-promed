On 24 Oct 2012, the Portuguese Ministry of Public Health (Direccao-Geral da Saude) confirmed 52 cases of dengue fever and 404 probable cases, compared to 37 confirmed and 262 probable cases in their previous update of 17 Oct [2012]. 40 people required hospitalisation, and 5 are still admitted to hospital. No deaths have been reported. The 1st cases were reported to the Portuguese public health authorities on 3 Oct 2012.

The United Kingdom, France, and Sweden have reported 4 cases of dengue among travellers returning from Madeira likely to have been infected during their stay on the island. Additional cases may be expected in the coming weeks.

The recent 4 cases of dengue among returning travellers from the island highlight the need for travellers to Madeira to protect themselves from mosquito bites by taking the necessary precautions. The Autonomous Region of Madeira has also published recommendations on their website for individual protection measures. In light of cases among returning travellers, ECDC renews its advice to those who visited Madeira and who experience febrile symptoms with severe headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, and maculo-papular rash within 14 days of their trip to seek medical advice.

ECDC is supporting the public health authorities of Madeira. A team of ECDC experts has been deployed since 22 Oct 2012 to assess the epidemiological and entomological situation and provide advice for prevention and control activities.

[The dengue outbreak in Madeira continues. Fortunately, the cases in travelers who acquired their dengue infections there will not initiate ongoing transmission in the United Kingdom and Sweden, as the vector mosquitoes are not present there. If the other traveler became ill in southern coastal France, there is a risk of ongoing dengue transmission, because _Aedes albopictus_, a competent dengue virus vector mosquito, is established there (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100731.2564).

[This is a rather tardy alert, considering that the outbreak on Madeira was confirmed on 3 Oct 2012 -- see report in Spanish (not Portuguese) of 62 confirmed cases at
http://www.abc.es/20121105/sociedad/abci-dengue-madeira-201211051409.html
and ProMED update (48) below -- yes, we know Madeira isn't in the Americas, but we had nowhere else to put it at the time. - Mod.JW]
