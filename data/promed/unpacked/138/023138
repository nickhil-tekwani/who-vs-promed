India: Faulty HIV test kits may have spread disease
-----------------------------------------------
Faulty blood-testing kits for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and
hepatitis [hepatitis B virus and/or hepatitis C virus?] may have been
fraudulently sold to government clinics across India, possibly
resulting in people receiving transfusions of infected blood,
officials said on Thu 2 Nov 2006. The government is seizing kits
across the country and has ordered a probe into the possible fraud,
after 2 brothers appeared in a Kolkata court on Mon [30 Oct 2006]
accused of selling hundreds of thousands of blood-testing kits long
past their expiration dates. Govind and Ghansyam Sharma, whose
company Monozyme India has several contracts to supply the kits to
the government, deny charges of malpractice and forgery. Both are
still in police custody after being denied bail.
"The Kolkata police findings have a strong nationwide connection, and
we have ordered seizures of kits from every other state," said P K
Hota, who retired on Wednesday [1 Nov 2006] as India's Health
Secretary. "We will ... find out how many people have been infected
by HIV or hepatitis and rectify the mistakes," he added.
The news follows a report published by Britain's Royal Society of
Medicine that said that India dangerously underestimated the number
of its estimated 5.7 million HIV-infected people who caught the virus
through reused needles in hospitals and similar hygiene lapses. U.S.
researchers, writing in the society's International Journal of STD
(sexually transmitted disease) and AIDS, said India is placing too
much emphasis on preventing the sexual transmission of the virus.
India says more than 80 percent of HIV-infected people caught the
virus while having sex, much of the time with prostitutes. The report
says these figures are inflated and are blinding India to preventing
other routes of transmission.
A tip-off from an employee at Monozyme resulted in police in the
eastern state of West Bengal, of which Kolkata is the capital,
finding more than 100 000 obsolete blood-test kits in blood banks
across the state. Monozyme India had supplied the kits, which are
used to screen potential blood donors, to at least 9 other Indian
states, police in Kolkata said. Two other medical supply companies
are now also under investigation suspected of similar fraud. There
are already reports of people [contracting] HIV after receiving blood
from donors who were wrongly given the all-clear.
Sailen Ghosh, secretary of the Thalassaemia (a blood disorder) and
AIDS Prevention Society in Kolkata, told Reuters he knew of at least
6 people who [had contracted] HIV in the last year after receiving
routine blood transfusions. Police said the number of people infected
with HIV and hepatitis after receiving badly screened blood could run
into thousands.

Transmission of virus infection via blood transfusion is an
ever-present risk that is usually a consequence of lack of
understanding of the properties of the infectious agent. Only rarely
is it due to criminal negligence. In the present case, it is unclear
to what extent the Monozyme HIV and hepatitis (B, C or both?) test
kits used to screen blood donations had exceeded their shelf-life.
From the tone of the Reuters report, it seems likely that the test
kits may have retained some activity and that there were other
deficiencies in the screening of donated blood for use in transfusion.
ProMED-mail would welcome information from a local source on the
outcome of the prosecution proceedings, and the final apportioning of
blame, in due course. - Mod.CP]
