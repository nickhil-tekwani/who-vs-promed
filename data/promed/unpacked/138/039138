A 6 month old kitten obtained on Craigslist has turned out positive for the nearly 100 per cent lethal virus, rabies, requiring nearly 2 dozen people to receive rabies post-exposure prophylaxis. The family of 4 from northeast Colorado Springs named the kitten Jello. The owners said the cat was fine for 2 weeks, and then the black cat "took a turn for the worse" and got very sick. The family's 2 other dogs and a cat had to be put down since they were exposed.

El Paso County Public Health officials say the kitten tested positive for rabies late last week. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment Laboratory performed the initial test, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is in the process of determining the type of rabies the kitten had. To date, El Paso County Public Health has identified 20 individuals, including the family, who have possibly been exposed to the rabid kitten. They are being treated with preventive medication, a series of post-exposure vaccinations.

This is the 1st rabid domestic cat in El Paso County, Colorado since 1966. Other animals that have tested positive for rabies in the county in recent years include: 2014: 10 (bats), 2013: 8 (4 bats, 2 foxes, 2 skunks), 2012: 3 (3 bats), 2011: 15 (5 bats, 1 fox, 9 skunks) and 2010: 17 (8 bats, 4 foxes, 5 skunks).

According to the Control of Communicable Diseases Manual, all mammals are susceptible to rabies. Raccoons, skunks, foxes, bats, dogs, coyotes and cats are the likely suspects. Other animals like otters and ferrets are also high risk. Mammals like rabbits, squirrels, rodents and opossums are rarely infected.

Rabies infected animals can appear very aggressive, attacking for no reason. Some may act very tame. They may look like they are foaming at the mouth or drooling because they cannot swallow their saliva. Sometimes the animal may stagger (this can also be seen in distemper). Not long after this point, they will die. Most animals can transmit rabies days before showing symptoms. Initially, as in many diseases, the symptoms of rabies are non-specific: fever, headache, and malaise. These may last several days. At the site of the bite, there may be some pain and discomfort. Symptoms then progress to more severe ones: confusion, delirium, abnormal behavior, and hallucinations. If it gets this far, the disease is nearly 100 per cent fatal.

Although worldwide it is estimated that there are more than 69 000 deaths due to rabies annually, human rabies cases are extremely rare in the United States, which averages less than 5 human rabies cases annually. Human rabies is prevented by administration of rabies vaccine and rabies immune globulin [infused into the bite wound].

[I am puzzled why the 2 dogs and the one cat in the house had to be put down. In that the family apparently took the sick kitten into their vet, I think one might assume that their other animals would possibly have been up to date on their rabies shots. Secondly, vaccinating and holding them in quarantine at their veterinary clinic for 3 weeks would be adequate, and, if necessary, they could have been revaccinated before being released. Animal control often gives the impression of being hypercautious and over keen to euthanise.

Of course, it might also help if ownerless and feral kittens were held in quarantine before being put up for adoption. The consistent story with these rabid kittens is that they develop symptoms within a couple of weeks of being adopted. They need to be held back, checked for any diseases, vaccinated, and then observed for problems. - Mod.MHJ
