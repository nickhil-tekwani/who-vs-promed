The death of a confirmed patient of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) [in Rawalpindi, Punjab] at the Holy Family Hospital (HFH) on [Thu 8 Sep 2016], has turned the situation more alarming while raising so many questions in the minds of almost all stakeholders about what actually the concerned government authorities have been doing for prevention and control of the ongoing CCHF spike in the country.

The number of cases of CCHF is continuously on the rise all across the country though the most affected province is Balochistan. However, significant number of confirmed patients of the deadly infection has been reported in Sindh and Punjab provinces.

In Rawalpindi, as many as 4 patients have been tested positive for CCHF during the ongoing CCHF outbreak of which 2 died of it while 2 have been discharged after achieving complete cure at HFH. It is important that confirmation of even one patient for CCHF is considered an outbreak.

The death of a 25 year old at HFH on [Thu 8 Sep 2016] is the 1st death due to CCHF at the allied hospitals this year however, another confirmed patient of the infection died of it at Fauji Foundation Hospital in town [Rawalpindi] some 2 weeks back.

A worker at a furniture shop in Chah Sultan, a central market in town was admitted to the HFH on [5 Sep 2016] with a history of fever for 8 days along with myalgia (pains in muscles), nausea, and bleeding from gums. According to a top official at HFH, the patient was presented to the hospital with low blood in an irritable condition and he was shifted to medical ICU from isolation ward for management but he could not survive.

The patient was a resident of Hazro Bhangi near Haleem Baba Masjid in District Attock [Punjab]. It is important that 2 CCHF suspects from Attock have already been tested negative for CCHF while result in one case is yet to be received by the HFH. Data collected by 'The News' on [Sat 10 Sep 2016] reveal that to date, a total of 35 suspects of CCHF have been registered with the HFH of which 3 have tested positive, 28 negative, while results in 4 cases are awaited.

According to details, a total of 9 suspects have been reported from Rawalpindi, 4 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 8 from Azad Jammu and Kashmir [AJK], 6 from Chakwal [Punjab], 4 from Attock [Punjab], 2 from Mianwali [Punjab], and one from Jhelum [Punjab]. One CCHF suspect reached HFH after return from Saudi Arabia.

However, so far a total of 3 suspects have been tested positive including 2 patients from Chakwal and one from Attock.

At present, as many as 4 CCHF suspects including 2 patients from AJK and one each from Attock and Chakwal are undergoing treatment at the HFH. Their samples have been sent to National Institute of Health for confirmatory reports.

CCHF is caused by _Nairovirus_ of the _Bunyaviridae_ family and transmitted to humans by the bite of hyalomma ticks that are mostly found on the skin of animals including goats, sheep, and cattle. Exposure to blood or tissue of the infected animal during or post slaughtering and direct contact with blood or secretions of an infected person may also cause transmission.

The case fatality rate of the deadly infection ranges from 2 per cent to 50 per cent. The CCHF was first described in Crimea in 1944 and identified in 1956 in Congo.

Many health experts are of the view that before and on the festive occasion of Eidul Azha [or Eid al-Adha, Festival of the Sacrifice], the population in this region of the country is in a need of taking extraordinary precautionary measures while handling sacrificial animals to avoid further spread of the deadly infection.

[Public awareness messages on handling the sacrificial animals properly and observing precautions during slaughter and meat handling are being aired on the media more frequently this year (2016). Handling of animal hides after the rituals is also an important exposure source that must be highlighted. - Mod.UBA
