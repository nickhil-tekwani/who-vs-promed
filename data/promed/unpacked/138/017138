***************************
... the first indigenous cholera case in three decades in Taiwan ...
***************************
Health officials have advised local hospitals and medical centers in Hsinchu
County, northern Taiwan, to be on guard after an old woman in a Hsinchu
hospital was diagnosed with cholera. The 80-year-old woman was admitted to
hospital in shock, suffering serious diarrhea and dehydration. The case, the
first indigenous cholera case in three decades in Taiwan, has triggered
panic
among the residents of Hukuo township, where the woman's family sells iced
products in the local market. Hsinchu health officials went to the woman's
house and the surrounding area to disinfect and take samples for analysis,
but
no other cases have surfaced so far.
