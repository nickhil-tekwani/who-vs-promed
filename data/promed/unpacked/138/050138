The Health Ministry has confirmed 4 cases of people with tickborne spotted fever and 4 more that are likely, so a sanitary cordon has already been implemented in 4 colonies of Saltillo [Coahuila]. Of the 4 confirmed cases, one is located in Saltillo, another in Parras de la Fuente, and 2 in Torreon, while the 4 probable cases are of the state capital [Saltillo].

Faced with this emergency, which has killed at least 2 girls in the Valle de las Aves colony in this sector and in the colonies of Lomas de Zapaliname, Pedregal, and Nueva Imagen, preventive measures were undertaken since last weekend [10-11 Nov 2012].

Luis Armando Hernandez Perez, head of Sanitary District no 8 of the Ministry of Health, said that these areas lack services such as water, sewage, pavement, and that nearby there is a stream full of garbage, which becomes a breeding ground so that dogs that inhabit the area fill with these animals and transmit them to humans.

To receive adequate treatment the patient must be attended within the 1st 7 days of when symptoms first appeared. Treatment is mainly based on antibiotics and in some cases the patient must remain hospitalized.
