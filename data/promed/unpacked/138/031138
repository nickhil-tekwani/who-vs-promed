Subject: Foot and mouth disease in Aramshe - Message No. 4.

1. The virus from the outbreak in Arab El-Aramshe has been identified as FMDV serotype A. The last time FMDV-A was found in Israel was 2009.
According to initial RNA sequencing, the virus strain closest to the current isolate is a 2015 Saudi isolate (A/ASIA/GVII).

2. The said A/ASIA/GVII strain is known to have spread since 2015 from Central Asia, so far identified in Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Armenia. There is no well-matching vaccine for this strain.

3. In addition, today [Thu 11 May 2017], a message from the Palestinian authorities has been received about FMD outbreaks diagnosed in 4 animal units in 2 locations: in Yata, Hebron area (2 sheep/goat flocks) and in Ein Arik, about 18 km [11.18 mi] from Ramallah (a cattle herd and a sheep/goats flock). The serotype has not been identified.

Maps are attached.

[The circular further includes detailed instructions addressing control and quarantine measures within specified zones, animal movement restriction, etc.].

[The identification of this new FMDV-A strain is concerning news. In particular, in view of the information about its suspected poor matching with the FMDV-A vaccine strains included in the vaccine compulsorily applied in Israel. The composition of the vaccine is as follows:
1. Serotype O: O Manisa, O-3039, O-4625, O Israel 2007 (4 strains)
2. Serotype A: A - 4165, A Iran 05 (2 strains)
3. Serotype Asia 1: Asia1 Shamir (1 vaccine strain).

Several submissions from Saudi Arabia have been received at Pirbright (WRLFMD) since 2015, most recently in February 2017 (collected from cattle in October 2016). According to EUFMD monthly global report for March 2017, FMDV serotypes A and O were detected in the 25 samples collected in Saudi Arabia from cattle and sheep between October and December 2016. The viral lineages identified for these serotypes were respectively A/ASIA/G-VII and O/ME-SA/PanAsia 2ANT-10.

All Saudia's completed genotyping results are to be found at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/sau.htm.

For a recent detailed report, including listed reference strains and their relationship to the Saudi strain, see
http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2017/WRLFMD-2017-00002-Saudi-Arabia-A-approved.pdf. The 2 closest (A/ ASIA/ G-VII) reference strains were:

1. SAU/16/95 (90.3 percent identity),
2. IND/40/2000 (89.9 percent identity).

Serotyping of the virus circulating in the West Bank (Palestinian authority, PA) is urgently needed. The locations of Yata and Ein-Arik are to be seen, respectively, at http://tinyurl.com/mukxz8t and http://tinyurl.com/m3xfgng (note their proximity to central Israel).

Hopefully, samples have already been submitted from the PA to the Beit-Dagan FMD laboratory and /or to WRLFMD.

This virus is, most probably, currently circulating in Lebanon (from where it, most likely, came to Arab el Aramshe, 1 km [0.62 mi] from the border) and in other countries in the region.

The FMDV-A identified in Israel in 2009 was genotyped Iran-05BAR-08. - Mod.AS
