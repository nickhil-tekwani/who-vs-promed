Suspected acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome in the Republic of the
Congo - WHO Update 3
--------------------------------------------------
As of Thu 13 Feb 2003, a total of 61 suspected cases and 50 deaths of
acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome has been reported in the districts
of Mbomo and Kell in Cuvette Ouest Region (see previous report:
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_02_12b/en/>).
WHO and other international partners are assisting the National
Coordination Committee in containing the outbreak. Experts in case
management and social mobilization from the Global Outbreak Alert and
Response Network will be joining the team from the Congolese Ministry
of Health and WHO in Mbomo and Kelle districts. The case management
experts will train health care workers in the identification and safe
care of patients, and the social mobilization staff will work with
the local communities to inform them about the disease and its
transmission. WHO has sent additional protective equipment to the
country.
