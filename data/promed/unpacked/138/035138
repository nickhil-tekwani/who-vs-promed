Positive Initial Detection for Anthrax at Pentagon
--------------------------------------------------
During routine mail operations, the Pentagon had a positive detection for
the presence of anthrax bacteria at the Remote Delivery Facility (RDF). The
RDF was evacuated while tests were conducted to determine if anthrax was
present. Subsequent tests have proven negative. However, the Department is
taking precautionary measures while [yet] further testing is conducted.
Cultures are being taken from all personnel who may have had contact with
deliveries. Those personnel have also been given the option to begin
antibiotic treatment if desired.
The RDF will resume normal operations upon the conclusion of all testing.

Biological Alarm Shuts Down 2nd DoD Facility
--------------------------------------------
Local officials shut down 3 buildings leased by the Defense Department in
suburban Virginia after a biological-agent detection system sounded an alarm
in one of the buildings 14 Mar 2005.
Initial test results indicated the presence of anthrax in the building,
located in the Skyline office complex in Falls Church. "At this time, it is
not clear if this is a false positive or a true positive result," advised a
press release from the Fairfax County government. Officials said additional
tests are being conducted.
This alarm came just hours after a mail-handling facility in a Pentagon
outbuilding was shut down because of a similar incident. Employees of the
Remote Delivery Facility were evacuated after an alarm indicated the
presence of a chemical or biological agent during normal operations. That
facility remains closed for further testing.
As of this morning, all 3 Skyline buildings, which are interconnected,
remain closed as well. Fairfax County officials said this measure is a
precaution until more testing can be completed. "However, health officials
stress that the general public is not at risk of exposure," the county press
release stated. The Skyline office complex houses several DoD agencies.
County officials required employees there to stay inside their buildings for
several hours after the alarm sounded in the afternoon. They were later
advised to wash their hands and faces before departing.
Information provided to all employees told them to go directly home and
place their clothing in a plastic bag and tie it. A fact sheet employees
received instructed them to keep the bag in a safe place and not to disturb
or open it until they receive further instructions.
On a recorded information line, a Fairfax County official advised that the
initial test results at the site are preliminary and that "confirmatory
tests" are being conducted. "Decisions regarding the need for antibiotic
treatment and follow-up will be based on these test results," the official
said. The Fairfax County information line number is (703) 246-2411.
Employees of the Pentagon site that was evacuated were provided with a 3-day
regimen of antibiotics after nasal swabs were taken from all individuals for
culture to test for individual exposure to anthrax, DoD officials said.

Anthrax Tests at Pentagon Prove Negative
----------------------------------------
2 Defense Department mail handling facilities were shut down on Monday after
sensitive detection devices indicated the presence of anthrax, but mail at
the facilities had already been irradiated to kill any bacteria, Pentagon
officials said. Initial tests at a delivery security facility on the
grounds of the Pentagon and at a satellite facility in an office complex
several miles away returned preliminary positive results, the Pentagon said.
But further tests were negative.
"During routine mail operations, the Pentagon had a positive detection for
the presence of anthrax bacteria at the Remote Delivery Facility," the
Pentagon said in a statement. "Subsequent tests have proven negative. These
testing machines are very sensitive and we have had false alarms before. But
we take these matters very seriously and are investigating," Defense
Department spokesman Glenn Flood told Reuters.
More tests to confirm the results were being conducted at the U.S. Army
Research Institute for Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick in Frederick,
Maryland, said Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Commander Jane Campbell. The results
are expected in 2-3 days.
The Pentagon said it was working closely with the FBI and the U.S. Postal
Service.
About 175 people who normally work at the receiving facility -- designed to
check everything coming into the building from letters to packages and
construction materials -- were evacuated when the investigation was launched
after an alarm was triggered. The Pentagon said cultures were being taken
from workers and they were being offered antibiotic treatment.
Although the receiving facility at the outer edge of the Pentagon was
closed, the public post office inside the world's biggest government office
building remained open.
Some 3000 workers in 3 office towers connected to the Defense Department
satellite facility were held inside late into the evening while emergency
crews did their work, according to local television reports.
The Pentagon is considered a potential target after the 11 Sep 2001 attacks
on the building and the World Trade Center in New York using hijacked
commercial airliners.

The preliminary anthrax confirmation was done through polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) testing and confirmed the alert initially reported by a
defense contractor laboratory in Richmond last week.
Concerns were raised about the Pentagon mail facility after tests last week
came back positive for anthrax, officials said. Interim tests there were
negative, but officials yesterday closed the facility and evacuated
employees there.
Shortly afterward, a sensor at the Department of Defense mailroom on
Leesburg Pike in Fairfax signaled the presence of a suspicious biological
substance, forcing hundreds of workers to remain inside the three buildings
in that complex for almost six hours.
The Pentagon and Fairfax facilities remained closed today as officials
continued investigating.
[The situation is somewhat more complex than the initial calming DOD reports
suggested. There seems to be something going around that is successfully
triggering the sensors. The authorities want to find out what is doing this.
At this time there is no indication that it is _B. anthracis_ itself. -

Pentagon Mail Center Tests Positive for Anthrax
-----------------------------------------------
Samples collected from a Defense Department mail center near the Pentagon
building have tested positive for deadly anthrax bacteria in a preliminary
examination, the U.S. government said on Tuesday.
Bill Hall, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said
an additional, more definitive test was being conducted on the sample to
confirm whether it is anthrax. Results could be available later in the day.
Hall said federal health officials would send a bulletin to doctors,
hospitals and clinics asking them to watch for patients suffering from
symptoms of exposure to anthrax. "It doesn't mean we're expecting anything
out there, but it's just out of the abundance of caution," Hall said.
2 Defense Department mail-handling facilities were closed on Monday [14 Mar
2005] after sensitive detection devices indicated the presence of anthrax,
but mail had already been irradiated to kill any bacteria, Pentagon
officials said.
On Tuesday [15 Mar 2005], a Washington [DC] postal center also was closed
and about 200 employees offered antibiotics as a precaution in case it had
handled the Pentagon mail, officials said.
Hall said experts registered a positive indication for anthrax using a
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on a sample taken from the Defense
Department's remote mail distribution facility, located just outside the
Pentagon building in Arlington County, Virginia. But Hall said the test was
not considered definitive and the finding is considered preliminary. "That
doesn't mean there is live anthrax and it doesn't mean that there is
actually any anthrax," Hall said.
He said there were no results yet from either the preliminary or the
definitive test of samples taken from the other facility closed on Monday --
a separate satellite Defense Department mail center located in an office
complex several miles away.
The Washington [DC] postal center that was closed on Tuesday was being
screened for anthrax traces, said Dr. Gregg Pane, director of the District
of Columbia's Department of Health. He said there was "no confirmed
detection" nor had employees reported any illness. "This is a prudent course
of action," Pane said. "I don't think there's cause for alarm or panic or
undue worry."

Feds Close Another Postal Facility; Health Officials Distribute Antibiotics
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The U.S. Postal Service confirms that it has shut down the V Street postal
facility in northeast Washington [DC]. A spokesman said testing is under way
to see if there is any contamination in that building.
D.C. Mayor Anthony Williams said in a news conference outside D.C. General
Hospital that all mail headed to the Pentagon comes through the V Street
facility at 3070 V St., N.E. Williams said about 250 people are employed
there.
Dr. Gregg Pane, chief medical officer for the District, said employees will
be given the antibiotic Cipro[floxacin] as a precaution against possible
biohazards. Pane said the antibiotic would be distributed from D.C. General
Hospital and health officials will continue giving it out until it has been
received by all employees. But health officials said it is up to the
individual employee to decide whether s/he would take it. [Prolonged
courses of cipro have been associated with severe side-effects. - Mod.JW]
3 federal mailroom facilities in Fairfax County, VA, have been closed
indefinitely until officials in Virginia learn what caused sensors that
detect hazardous materials to sound off Monday. Fairfax County Fire and
Rescue spokesman Dan Schmidt said a lab [USAMRIID] is testing the substance
right now and officials hope to have results sometime on Tuesday [15 Mar
2005].
Schmidt said right now authorities don't know what triggered the alarms and
they won't know until final testing is complete. Virginia Department of
Health officials said there were signs of a suspicious substance at both a
Pentagon mail facility and a Fairfax County military mailroom in the
Bailey's Crossroads area.

[The Washington Post has a long article on this event, with a lot of human
interest: "Initial Pentagon Test Is Positive for Anthrax; Officials Trying
to Determine if Bacteria Were Live" By Spencer Hsu, Jamie Stockwell and Fred
Barbash, Washington Post Staff Writers
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35943-2005Mar15.html>
And in their hypersensitive manner the US stock prices fell in response to
this news:
<http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?
pid=10000087&sid=aZ8VvrjZSJa4&refer=top_world_news>
"U.S. Stocks Fall on Anthrax Report; AIG, Technology Shares Drop "
By all accounts the Pentagon responded in a very responsible manner, even
though there is a small measure of uncertainty as to the
confirmed "negative," which is sensible. We can assume that the sensors will
occasionally sound the alarm, and let us hope that they will continue to be
false positives. I am deeply appreciative to Joe Dudley for his phone call
and for sharing these reports with us. - Mod.MHJ]
