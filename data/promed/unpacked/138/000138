I don't get it. Recent reports still show >10% _Salmonella_ at the
processing plant -- it is not going to vanish by point of use. I am afraid
that our public health service are finding scapegoats (e.g.e Frank Bauer)
rather than admit their inherent inadequacies.

This is the reason I appended the note at the end of my post. The
difference here is that we're talking about _Salmonella_ contamination of
COOKED product, not of RAW meat. As the gentleman mentions, baseline
incidence of _Salmonella_ in poultry is known to be high, ~ 30-50% in prior
years (although it's low in beef, with ~ 1-2% prevalence on carcasses).
However, the pasteurization step required by USDA for cooking supplies a 7
D kill on _Salmonella_. Therefore none should be detectable.

[For those who do not remember the posting in question the key paragraph read:
>>The recall of cooked patties of beef, pork and chicken took effect Sept.
28 for products shipped by Zartic Inc. of Cedartown, Ga. The cooked patties
went to "institutional users" only and were not sold in stores, USDA
spokeswoman Linda Swacina said Saturday. There have been no reports of
illness caused by contaminated Zartic products, she said. "The cause is
still under investigation," she said.<<
Thanks, Bob. - Mod.MHJ
