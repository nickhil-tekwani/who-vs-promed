Bird flu hits the Caucasus
--------------------------
Since bird flu reached Azerbaijan last week, the rest of the Caucasus has
been gripped by anxiety about the virus. Although no cases of human
infection with the deadly H5N1 virus have been officially confirmed in
Azerbaijan yet, people have stopped eating chicken. In Dagestan to the
north, by contrast, consumers appear more fatalistic. The virus was 1st
identified in dead migrating birds found on Azerbaijan's Caspian shoreline
on 9 Feb 2006. Tests in a London lab proved positive.
A few days later, 15 more wild birds were found dead in the Ceyranbatan
reservoir, which provides most of the water for the capital Baku. Further
reports of dead birds started coming in from the Khachmaz, Samukh, and
Fizuli districts.
To curb the spread of bird flu, President Ilham Aliev set up a state
commission headed by Deputy Prime Minister Abbas Abbasov. So far, the state
commission's activities have been limited to collecting samples from dead
birds and sending them off for examination at laboratories in Europe and
Egypt. No preventive measures have been taken to date. [While there are
claims of human cases, even deaths], Health Minister Oktay Siraliev has
denied that anyone is infected with the bird flu virus, although he did say
that 3 hospitals in the capital have made provision for a possible
epidemic. According to health ministry spokeswoman Samaya Mamedova, 2
residents of Pirallakhi who are sisters were been taken to a hospital with
isolation facilities on 12 Feb 2006. Although they had high temperatures
when they were admitted, they were later discharged at the request of
relatives, and both are in a satisfactory state of health, said Mamedova.
As demand has fallen away, the poultry trade has been hard hit, and the
price of beef and lamb have almost doubled. "That suits the meat salesmen
very well," said a mother of 3. "They immediately raised the price of one
kilogram of beef from 15 000 to 19 000 [old] manats (USD 3.20 to 4.10). The
government should take some measures, otherwise we'll die of hunger if not
flu."
Fewer people are buying chickens in Azerbaijan markets since bird flu has
been confirmed in the region. As a result of the panic, government run
poultry farms and private farmers have incurred colossal losses over the
past week. Gasym Bairamov, director of a large poultry company called
Mardakan Broiler, said his firm has halted sales. Tofik Tagiev, chairman of
the Goradil Gusculug company, complained that the public was being misled
into panic. "The public is being given incorrect information for the sake
of sensation," he said. "I can reassure you that all our chickens are quite
healthy."
In the southern Massali district, farmers who slaughtered their chickens
after H5N1 was found in the region say the government is now ignoring them.
Local farmer Eyub Ganiev is demanding compensation from the authorities.
"The government in Turkey is paying good compensation for slaughtered
birds. No one cares about us," he said. Deputy Prime Minister Abbasov, in
charge of combating the spread of the virus, admitted that the Azerbaijani
government had not yet considered the issue of compensation. He said the
agriculture ministry had been allocated around USD 850 000 to combat bird
flu, but that in reality it would take USD 16 million to tackle the problem
effectively.
On 14 Feb 2006, Russia imposed restrictions on imports of live birds,
incubatory eggs, poultry flesh and other products from Azerbaijan.
Numbers of migratory birds have been found dead in Dagestan, the Russian
region adjacent to Azerbaijan. More than 300 000 chickens were killed in
the Karabudakhkent district, although the local authorities have denied
this had anything to do with bird flu.
People in Dagestan, who live with chronic political violence, show little
sign of being scared at the prospect of bird flu. Poultry is freely
available at the markets, and game birds are also on sale, even though the
government has banned hunting because of the virus. "We eat them
ourselves," said Zaidat, a market trader in the southern town of Derbent.
In confirmation, she lifted the cover of a pan with a chicken cooking away
inside. "Sick chickens never have such good color."

Ethiopia confirms bird flu
--------------------------
Ethiopia confirmed today [28 Feb 2006] that bird flu caused the deaths of
thousands of chickens in a southern region and said tests would be
conducted in Europe to determine the precise strain of the virus.
Since 16 Feb 2006, more than 6000 chickens have died at a government-owned
farm in the Endibir area of the Southern Nation and Nationality People's
(SNNP) state. "According to our laboratory, it is avian flu, but there are
many sorts of avian flu. To determine the specific type of avian flu, we
have to send the samples to another laboratory in Italy," agriculture and
rural development ministry spokesman Mulugeta Debalkew told AFP.
Samples from the dead birds would be dispatched to Italy over the next 2
days and tested for the lethal H5N1 strain of avian influenza, which has
killed a little over 90 people, mostly in Asia, since 2003.
Earlier, officials said local tests had confirmed the presence of a "bird
flu-like" disease in 49 chickens in the farm, 175 km (110 miles) south west
of the capital.
Debalkew explained that measures were being taken to prevent the disease
from spreading, including a ban on the sale of the poultry and poultry
products within a 60 km (40 mile) radius of Gubere.
Selashi said that some 9000 chickens in the affected Gubere Poultry Center
would be killed starting today [28 Feb 2006].
Ethiopia, along with other east African Rift Valley nations, such as Kenya,
Tanzania, and Uganda, are considered at high risk for the spread of the
virus, as millions of migratory birds flock there during the European winter.
In Nairobi, Kenyan authorities said 400 dead chickens were being tested for
H5N1. [At this time there is no evidence other than veterinary concerns
that these deaths are from avian influenza. - Mod.MHJ]

H5N1 bird flu virus found in cat in North Germany
-------------------------------------------------
A dead cat from the Baltic Sea island of Ruegen, where Germany's 1st cases
of bird flu were detected, has tested positive for the H5N1 avian influenza
strain, the Federal Research Institute for Animal Health said. Tests still
need to be done to determine whether it is the high-pathogen version of the
H5N1 virus that is dangerous to people, the organization, also known as the
Friedrich Loeffler Institute, said today [28 Feb 2006] in a faxed
statement. The institute is based on Riems, another north German island.
2 wild birds in the southern state of Bavaria also tested positive for the
H5N1 virus, the Bavarian Environment, Health and Consumer Protection said
today [28 Feb 2006] on its website. Bavaria is the 5th of Germany's 16
states in which bird flu has been detected, after the northern regions of
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Schleswig-Holstein, and Brandenburg and the
southern state of Baden-Wurttemberg.
Avian influenza was 1st detected on Ruegen on 14 Feb 2006, leading to the
immediate imposition of preventive measures to try to keep the disease from
spreading. Most of the affected wild birds so far have been swans and
ducks. The cat, which was found last weekend near the place of the 1st bird
flu cases, is the 1st domestic animal in which the virus has been detected.
It hasn't spread to poultry in Germany yet.
Domestic cats can contract and spread avian flu, said the president of the
institute, Thomas Mettenleiter, in the statement.
Cat Owners Warned: "It has been known from Asia for some time that cats can
infect themselves with the virus if they eat infected birds," Mettenleiter
said. He recommended that cat owners in areas with bird flu not let their
cats run around freely outside. Wild cats in Asia died last year in zoos
after being fed with H5N1-infected birds, the institute said. Domestic cats
are also susceptible, though it hasn't been proven that they can spread the
virus to people, it said. Still, human infection could not be ruled out in
cases of very close contact with a cat, Mettenleiter said.
Researchers at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands let
cats eat chicks that had been infected with the H5N1 lethal form of the
virus, the Swiss newspaper SonntagsBlick said on 19 Feb 2006. All the cats
got sick and were able to spread the virus through their breath, urine and
excrement, the newspaper reported. At least 15 other countries on 3
continents have reported initial outbreaks of the virus this month
[February 2006]: Iraq, Iran, Bulgaria, Nigeria, Greece, Azerbaijan, Italy,
Austria, Hungary, Egypt, India, France, Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
The spread of the virus in birds creates more risk for human infection, as
people come into contact with poultry during slaughtering, plucking
feathers, butchering or preparation for cooking.

[4] Germany: H5N1 in domestic cats

H5N1 avian influenza in domestic cats
-------------------------------------
Authorities in Germany have today [28 Feb 2006] announced detection of H5N1
avian influenza in a domestic cat. The cat was found dead over the weekend
on the northern island of Ruegen. Since mid-February 2006, more than 100
wild birds have died on the island, and tests have confirmed H5N1 infection
in several.
There is no present evidence that domestic cats play a role in the
transmission cycle of H5N1 viruses. To date, no human case has been linked
to exposure to a diseased cat. No outbreaks in domestic cats have been
reported.
Unlike the case in domestic and wild birds, there is no evidence that
domestic cats are a reservoir of the virus. All available evidence
indicates that cat infections occur in association with H5N1 outbreaks in
domestic or wild birds.
Experimental studies, published in September 2004, demonstrated that the
H5N1 virus can infect domestic cats, and that cats can transmit the virus
to other cats. In these experiments, the cats developed disease following
direct inoculation of virus isolated from a fatal human case, and following
the feeding of infected raw chicken.
The current H5N1 panzootic in birds, which began in mid-December 2005 in
parts of Southeast Asia, has been accompanied by a few anecdotal reports of
H5N1 infection in domestic cats. In all such reports, eating raw infected
poultry was considered the most likely source of infection for the cats.
Several published studies have demonstrated H5N1 infection in large cats
kept in captivity. In December 2003, 2 tigers and 2 leopards, fed on fresh
chicken carcasses, died unexpectedly at a zoo in Thailand. Subsequent
investigation identified H5N1 in tissue samples.
In February 2004, the virus was detected in a clouded leopard that died at
a zoo near Bangkok. A white tiger died from infection with the virus at the
same zoo in March 2004.
In October 2004, captive tigers fed on fresh chicken carcasses began dying
in large numbers at a zoo in Thailand. Altogether, 147 tigers out of 441
died of infection or were euthanized. Subsequent investigation determined
that at least some tiger-to-tiger transmission of the virus occurred.

Veterinarians held over Ibaraki bird flu cover up
-------------------------------------------------
Police arrested 4 people Monday [27 Feb 2006] related to a poultry farm
operator in Ibaraki Prefecture in connection with a suspected cover up of
an avian flu outbreak last year [2005]. Police suspect [that 3]
veterinarians at IKN Egg Farms Co, and an IKN employee violated the
Domestic Animal Infectious Diseases Control Law, which requires reporting
any suspected contagious diseases in poultry.
They also suspect an antibody test conducted at the National Institute of
Animal Health in Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture by a veterinarian at the
request of the IKN vets was positive, the sources said. The Tsukuba
veterinarian is an acquaintance of the IKN vets.
The 4 IKN employees allegedly failed to report a case of suspected avian
flu infection to the Ibaraki government late last August 2005. Polices
searched IKN Egg Farms and the Tsukuba research institute in December 2005
and questioned the vets. The vets at IKN Egg Farm are also suspected of
obstructing an avian flu test at 3 farms conducted by Ibaraki Prefecture
last August 2005 by submitting samples taken from other poultry farms, the
sources said. The prefecture has alleged that IKN Egg Farms committed
similar misdeeds at 2 other poultry farms it operates in Ibaraki,
prefectural officials said.
Avian flu infections have been found at 40 farms in Ibaraki Prefecture
since June 2005, and about 5.8 million chickens have had to be killed.

Avian influenza - situation (poultry) in Niger
----------------------------------------------
Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza has been confirmed in poultry in
Niger, marking spread of the virus to a 2nd country in sub-Saharan Africa.
During February 2006, significant mortality of chickens and ducks was
observed in 5 outbreaks in 2 administrative districts near the border with
Nigeria. Positive test results were reported yesterday [27 Feb 2006] on
samples taken from dead ducks in Magaria and Dan Barde, located in one of
the 2 districts. Investigation of the additional outbreaks is underway.
Staff at the WHO country office in Niger reported today that no human cases
are presently under investigation for possible H5N1 infection.
In neighboring Nigeria, an outbreak in the northern part of the country was
officially confirmed on 8 Feb 2006, but is now known to have begun almost a
month earlier. Detection of the virus in Niger confirms fears that
conditions in West Africa, including late detection of outbreaks, the fluid
movement of birds across borders, and low population awareness of the
disease, will favor spread to additional countries.
Experience in all affected countries has shown how easily and rapidly the
virus can become established in birds when detection is late and the
introduction of control measures is delayed.
In Nigeria's northern province of Kano, near the border with Niger, some 51
farms are now known to have been affected. In that country, 4 persons have
been investigated to date for possible H5N1 infection. Local tests have
ruled out infection in 3 of these cases, including one which was fatal.
Outbreaks in numerous other African countries -- from Ethiopia and Kenya in
the East to Gabon, Gambia, and Sierra Leone in the West -- are currently
under investigation. Throughout most of Africa, rapid detection and
investigation of outbreaks are hampered by the absence of an early warning
system for avian influenza in animals or humans, inadequate diagnostic
capacity, and difficulties in shipping specimens, both internally and
abroad, for diagnostic confirmation.
Concern that human cases may occur in affected parts of Africa is high,
given the close contact between people and poultry. Laboratory studies have
shown that the virus presently circulating in Nigeria is virtually
identical to viruses that have caused human cases and deaths elsewhere
since the start of this year [2006].
The continent has an estimated 1.1 billion chickens, mostly produced in
backyard farming systems. Traditional practices, exacerbated by rural
poverty, favor the home slaughter and consumption of birds when signs of
illness appear in a flock. These behaviors carry a high risk of human
exposures and infections. While most countries in Africa have a veterinary
infrastructure that serves commercial farms, few have services extending to
rural areas. WHO is concerned that spread of the virus to additional parts
of Africa will broaden opportunities for human cases to occur under
circumstances where capacities to find, diagnose, investigate, and manage
cases are limited. Each additional human case gives the virus an
opportunity to evolve towards a form that spreads easily from person to person.

Romania confirms new case of bird flu in poultry
------------------------------------------------
Romania confirmed the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus in domestic birds in the
village of Topalu, in the south east, and detected new suspected cases,
authorities said on Tuesday [28 Feb 2006].
Avian flu has been detected in 35 villages and a small Black Sea resort
across the country since the virus was 1st found in the Danube Delta in
October 2005. Birds have been culled swiftly, and Romania has not reported
any cases in humans.
"The national laboratory isolated the H5N1 virus in the village of Topalu,
where all the birds will be culled today [28 Feb 2006]," the agriculture
ministry said in a statement. It said all the 15 000 domestic birds in
Topalu will be culled.
Gabriel Predoi, an official from the animal health agency ANSV told Reuters
that new suspected cases of bird flu were found in poultry in 4 villages in
the southeast of the country. Domestic birds in another village where bird
flu was 1st discovered in December 2005 tested positive again, but the
virus has not been isolated yet, he added.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza in tufted ducks, Sweden
---------------------------------------------------------
Diagnostic investigations of carcasses of tufted ducks (_Aythya fuligula_)
found in close proximity to [the south eastern port of] Oskarshamn revealed
positive results in 2 out of 4 samples at the National Veterinary
Institute, Uppsala on 27 Feb 2006 by avian influenza virus specific real
time RT PCR. Subsequent positive results obtained with an H5 subtype
specific conventional RT PCR and sequencing of the 260 bp amplicon spanning
the HA cleavage site showed a polybasic pattern (SPQGERRRKKR*GLF)
indicative of highly pathogenic properties.
Comparison of the amplified fragment with published sequences revealed 100
per cent identity (on nucleotide level) with isolates from Russia
(Novosibirsk H5N1) and China (Jiangxi H5N1), and only one nt difference
from an H5N1 isolate from Nigeria.
Samples from the infected birds were sent to the European Community
Reference Laboratory, Weybridge for further analysis and N subtyping on 28
Feb 2006.
Protection and surveillance zones have been implemented according to EU
legislation.
