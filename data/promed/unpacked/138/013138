A federal committee voted Wednesday to recommend vaccinating about 510 000
hospital workers against smallpox, bringing its earlier proposal closer to
the Bush administration's suggestion.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices voted 8-1 for the plan, which amounts to vaccinating
about 100 workers at all hospitals in the nation that could handle smallpox
patients.
Those receiving shots at the hospitals with ``negative pressure rooms''
would include emergency room doctors, nurses, radiology technicians, and
selected security and housekeeping workers.
The vaccine can cause dangerous side effects, even death, in a fraction of
patients. Smallpox has been declared eradicated from the globe, but some
experts fear that terrorists have samples of the virus and could use it as
a devastating biological weapon.
The recommendation is not binding, and the final decision on vaccines will
be made by the White House.
Under the proposal being considered by the Bush administration,
vaccinations would first be offered to hospital emergency room workers,
with about a half million expected to take it, then it would be made
available to about 10 million other health care and emergency workers and
finally to the general public.
The committee chose the plan over 2 other proposals:
-- Its original recommendation, which was to establish regional hospitals
that would handle all smallpox cases and vaccinate emergency workers and
select staff -- about 10 000 to 20 000 people.
-- Vaccinating all of the nation's first responders -- firefighters,
paramedics, and police officers who could come in contact with smallpox
cases. That would involve inoculating up to 10 million people. This plan is
similar to one suggested by Bush administration officials earlier this month.
Committee members said they changed their earlier recommendation after more
study and feedback, not because of political pressure.
"Many hospitals, particularly those with negative pressure rooms need to be
prepared, because you can't say where smallpox patients will arrive,'' said
Dr. Guthrie Birkhead.
Birkhead said the regional plan had some weaknesses, including hospitals
not wanting the stigma of being the "regional smallpox hospital.''
Dr. Paul Offit of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia was the only
dissenting board member.
"`We're thinking about immunizing 500 000 people in a country for a disease
that is still theoretical. We haven't seen a case of smallpox on this
planet for 25 years,'' he said. "If there's not a case of smallpox, we will
be doing more harm than good.''
Offit suggested not vaccinating anyone until a case of smallpox is found.
Routine smallpox vaccinations in the United States ended in 1972 when
health officials noticed the vaccine's complications were hurting more
people than the virus. Experts say 15 out of every million vaccinated for
the first time will face life-threatening complications and one or 2 will
die. Reactions are less common for those being revaccinated.
Some experts say that the virus -- which can kill about 30 percent of
non-vaccinated, infected people -- can cause much more harm today than the
vaccine, especially if used as a weapon by terrorists. But others fear that
the smallpox shot may be useless if terrorists alter the virus.
The Bush administration's top smallpox expert -- Dr. D.A. Henderson, who
was instrumental in its eradication -- has said the administration is
``very worried'' about the possibility that Iraq may have smallpox samples.
The advisory committee also will discuss other immunization concerns,
including whether to give children ages 6 months to 2 years flu shots and
how children can ``catch up'' and receive any childhood immunizations they
may have missed during the childhood immunization shortage of the last few
years.

[It will be interesting to read more information on the discussions held by
the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to see what
additional data were presented that influenced the committee to shift the
recommendation for a more limited vaccination policy to a larger pool to be
vaccinated. - Mod.MPP]
