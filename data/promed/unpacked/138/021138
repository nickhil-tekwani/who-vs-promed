[1] Cholera - Tanzania, Angola, Mozambique

At least 45 people have been killed following an ongoing outbreak [of cholera] in Southern Africa and Tanzania. Angola and Tanzania are bearing the brunt with 20 and 15 deaths respectively. The water borne disease is most severe in Mozambique where 2159 cases have been recorded. As many as 4 people have died. In total, Southern Africa and Tanzania have suffered 3848 cases according to the Joint Cholera Initiative for Southern Africa (JCISA).

JCISA said for the last few weeks, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe had not recorded any cases while Angola was also reporting a considerable reduction in incidents. However, the Tanzania outbreak, even though considerably reduced, continued with sporadic cases persisting in Dar-es-Salaam.

JCISA includes Tanzania in its assessment of Southern Africa owing to its close proximity to most countries affected by cholera and the risk associated with cross border movement. Health ministers from Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe met at the beginning of the month [May 2017] to explore ways of addressing the cholera problem. A technical workshop was also held in Harare last week [week 15 to 21 May 2017].

Cholera killed 291 people from over 19 000 cases in the region in 2016.

[2] Cholera - Sudan
Date: Mon 22 May 2017

More than 10 people died of cholera and at least 39 new cases were recorded in White Nile state last week [week 15 to 21 May 2017]. An activist urged the declaration of the State of Emergency in order to contain the spread of the disease in White Nile and neighbouring Khartoum and Sennar.

On [Sun 21 May 2017], civil society activist Abdelrahman El Siddig told Radio Dabanga from Rabak that representatives of White Nile civil society organisations have carried out field trips to hospitals and medical isolation centres in Asalaya, El Jezira Aba, and Rabak. "At least 10 patients died and 35 new infections were reported in the area of Asalaya last week. Another 4 new cases were recorded in El Gezira Aba on [Sat 20 May 2017], he said.

According to El Siddig, the continuing spread of the infectious disease in the area of Asalaya is caused by the pollution of water with the wastes of the large Asalaya sugar factory. The activist called on the authorities to declare the State of Emergency in order to contain the large spread of the disease in White Nile state and the neighbouring Khartoum and Sennar states. He also appealed to the World Health Organisation, international and Sudanese health organisations and associations to act urgently to combat the spread of cholera.

Residents of El Salam village in Asalaya have turned the Khalifa Basic School into a field hospital for cholera patients, after 2 women and a man died on [Sat 20 May 2017], at the health centre of the Asalaya Sugar Factory. "The factory management closed the door for new cholera patients for fear that the disease may spread among the factory workers," an activist from the village told this station.

The number of people infected with cholera in neighbouring Sennar state is increasing again since early May 2017. A total of 6 new cholera cases were recorded in the area of El Mazmum on [Fri 19 and Sat 20 May 2017]. Last week [week 15 to 21 May 2017], 3 cholera patients died in the Abuareef health centre, and 2 in El Dali.

Though Sudanese medics have confirmed that the disease definitely concerns cholera, federal health authorities continue to deny its presence, and have instructed all medics and health workers to speak about watery diarrhoea instead. Cholera "seems to be a stigma for the government," a UK-based Sudanese specialist told Radio Dabanga in January [2017]. He said he fears that the current situation will turn into a long-lasting outbreak. Medical sources speak about thousands of people who are infected with cholera in the country. The death toll has climbed into the hundreds.

[Contaminated water remains the major risk factor for the acquisition of _V. cholerae_. As reported in Africa (currently particularly in the Horn of Africa) periods of flooding and drought increase the risk of outbreaks.

As demonstrated in Haiti and now in Yemen, the introduction of cholera into a country with a destroyed sanitary system and no underlying immunity can cause a major epidemic. In the classical endemic areas such as the Indian subcontinent and other areas in Asia, rainy seasons often accentuate the number of cases. Acute watery diarrhea is often used as an alternative term for cholera, the primary cause of outbreaks of watery diarrhea with fatalities in adults. - Mod.LL
