Chikungunya has infected hundreds of people living in Sudimoroharjo village, Nganjuk regency, East Java.

One of the victims said on Monday [11 Nov 2013] that he had suffered from headaches and joint pain over the past week. "I'm feeling better though, after having received treatment," he said, as quoted by Antara news agency. He said many of his neighbors had suffered from the same disease after being bitten by mosquitoes. "At least 30 other neighbors complain about the pain," he said.

Hundreds of villagers have received treatment at a local health center for the same disease.

Head of Wilangan health center Bagus Sodikin said around 75 per cent of Sudimoroharjo villagers had been treated after having had experienced the same symptoms.

Bagus said the disease was spread by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, especially when the season changed from dry to rainy. He said the health center was still waiting for the Nganjuk health service agency to start fogging to eradicate the mosquitoes.

[Although no case numbers are given, this appears to be a significant outbreak in Sudimoroharjo village, with the majority of the population affected. Since chikungunya virus infections can lead to incapacitating arthralgia that may persist for weeks or even months, the outbreak may have prolonged social and economic consequences. Fogging is unlikely to eradicate the mosquito vector. Elimination or abatement and treatment of breeding sites would be a more effective measure to attempt to reduce the vector mosquito population and reduce virus transmission.

Chikungunya virus is endemic in Indonesia, and sporadic outbreaks occur in various localities. Within the past 10 months in Indonesia, there have been cases of chikungunya virus infection in Bali, West Sumatra, Central Java, and West Java.
