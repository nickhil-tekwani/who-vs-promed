A slight correction to the note at the end about rojak: Rojak means a
mix of various ingredients and applies to a wide range of dishes that
have nothing in common. The dish "rojak" is a largely vegetable dish
attributed to the Malay community. The dish is uncooked and can be
classified as a type of salad.

Indian rojak, on the other hand, comprises various food items that
are deep fried then chopped up and served with a sweet orange sauce.
The most popular components are potato, dough-covered hard-boiled
eggs, various dough balls (including a flattened dough ball with a
large prawn embedded (shell and all), cuttlefish, chicken, etc. See
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rojak#Mamak_rojak.2C_or_Indian_rojak_.28Pasembor.29>.
It is not an Indian dish but a local creation traditionally sold by Indians.

Prawns should have been cooked well enough to render the head and
shell crispy enough to eat. That should have been hot enough to
eliminate any pathogens, so this might have been caused by cross
contamination.
