Abstract
--------
In this report, 3 cases of human cutaneous anthrax are described, one complicated by meningitis, and all were linked to a single infected bullock. A 41 year old male truck driver, along with 2 male slaughterhouse workers, [aged] 45 and 42, were hospitalized for necrotic lesions of the arm associated with edema of the limb and high fever. All 3 patients were involved in transporting a bullock to the slaughterhouse. Microbiological examination on the prescapular lymph node and a piece of muscle from the bullock carcass showed the presence of _Bacillus anthracis_. The 3 patients underwent a biopsy of the affected tissues, and all samples tested positive for _B. anthracis_ DNA using PCR. Furthermore, the truck driver also complained of an intense headache, and a CSF sampling was performed, showing him positive for _B. anthracis_ by PCR, confirming the presumptive diagnosis of meningitis. Fast diagnosis and appropriate treatment are crucial for the management of human anthrax. Cooperation between human and veterinary medicine proved successful in diagnosing and resolving 3 human anthrax cases, confirming the reliability of the One Health approach for the surveillance of zoonoses.

[Anthrax meningitis is not rare, just not frequently reported. In this case, the nature of the exposure is unclear but probably it was during the loading of this bullock carcass into the driver's truck. The 2 non-meningitic cases were slaughterhouse workers, so potentially they might have had additional exposure while butchering the carcass, but fortunately, it was not so severe. The men are reported to have had significant cutaneous lesions on their forearms.

The lesson from this is that cutaneous lesions, which may be minor, still have the potential to initiate systemic infections. Fortunately, in this instance, the hospital staff were alert and moved actively and successfully to identify the cause of the "headache" and take the necessary medical action. With thanks to Mahmoud. - Mod.MHJ
