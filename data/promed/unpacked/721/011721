[1] Watermelon line may help breeders combat powdery mildew

Agricultural Research Service (ARS) researchers and cooperators are
introducing watermelon stock that may help breeders combat powdery
mildew, a disease that threatens watermelon yields and quality in
several states. Recently, 2 races of powdery mildew have been
reported on watermelon, and they appear to be geographically
separate. Existing watermelon lines, which were thought resistant,
were found to be susceptible. But ARS researchers and colleagues
discovered the 1st documented resistance to race 1 powdery mildew in
an ARS germplasm collection.
The scientists 1st analyzed existing lines from the ARS Southern
Regional Plant Introduction Station in Griffin, BA., for resistance
to race 1 using field and growth chamber studies. They developed the
new watermelon line, PI 525088-PMR, by repeatedly selecting the most
resistant plants from the line PI 525088 (_Citrullus lanatus_ var.
_lanatus_). According to Angela R. Davis, geneticist at the ARS South
Central Agricultural Research Laboratory in Lane, Oklahoma,
watermelon has historically been resistant to powdery mildew, but the
disease has become widespread during the past few years. A
significant problem in Europe and Africa for about a decade, powdery
mildew has emerged as a severe problem in some areas of the United
States. Powdery mildew appears as a dusty white or gray coating over
leaf surfaces or other plant parts, and can be difficult to control.
Davis conducted the research with Annon Levi, an ARS geneticist with
the U.S. Vegetable Laboratory in Charleston, S.C.; Todd C. Wehner of
North Carolina State University in Raleigh; and Michael Pitrat of
France's National Institute for Agricultural Research. The new
watermelon line may be useful for introducing resistance to race 1
powdery mildew (caused by the fungus _Podosphaera xanthii_),
previously known as _Sphaerotheca fulginea auct_. p.p.) into
commercial watermelon cultivars.
Ultimately, it may also reduce the amount of fungicide needed to
control the disease.

[2] Information on powdery mildew on cucurbits
Date: 3 Apr 2007
From: Dick Hamilton <rihamilto@shaw.ca>

Powdery mildew [PM] is caused by 2 fungal pathogens, _Erysiphe
cichoracearum_ and _Sphaerotheca fulginea _. PM is a major production
problem and has been observed since the 1800s. Although there are
powdery mildew fungi on many plants, these 2 species only infect
muskmelon, cucumber, squash, pumpkin, gourd, and watermelon.
PM can cause smaller fruit and far lower numbers of fruit that is
less able to be successfully stored, sun scalded, incompletely ripe,
and of poor flavor. PM may also predispose plants to black rot. It is
favored by moderate temperatures. These fungi usually do not require
the leaves to be wet for them to infect the leaf, but rather the
humidity must be high. Spores are produced when the humidity is low.
These fungi occur mainly on leaves, which are most susceptible 2 to 3
weeks after unfolding. A whitish, powdery, fungal growth is present
on the leaves, and fungal growth often starts on the shaded
undersurface of the crown leaves. PM can be found covering both upper
and lower leaf surfaces. Severely affected leaves can become dry and
brittle or can wither and die. Exposed vines and fruit are more prone
to sunscald, and the vines may shrivel. Rarely, fruit infection
occurs in watermelon and cucumber.
For disease management, select a site with good air circulation and
low humidity. Separate new plantings from old plantings. Use a crop
rotation of at least one year. Control cucurbit weeds and other
weeds. Resistance is available in muskmelon, cucumber, summer squash,
and pumpkin.

[Resistance breeding is an important tool to combat crop diseases.
However, pathogens are forever changing and new mutant strains
overcoming available genetic resistance in crops emerge frequently. A
recent example with severe economical implications is the emergence
of the strain Ug99 of wheat stem rust (_Puccinia graminis_)
overcoming major resistant genes in wheat.
