There is a significant rise of chikungunya [virus infection] cases in the Pink City [Jaipur]. According to the health department's records, in the microbiology lab of SMS [Sawai Man Singh] Hospital from January 2012 until now [15 Jul 2012], 29 cases of chikungunya [virus infection] have been detected.

Chikungunya is an insect-borne virus transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. The infection causes an illness with symptoms similar to dengue fever. The fever can go up to 104 F [40 C] and creates pain in the joints of the infected person.

"In the rainy season, mosquitoes find breeding ground due to water logging, and chikungunya cases increase. The diseases [virus] is caused [is transmitted] by _Aedes_ mosquitoes," Director Public Health Dr BR Meena said. "Seeing the rainy season, we are conducting anti-larvae activities, and door-to-door surveys are being conducted. The rapid response teams have been alerted in Jaipur and across the state. All the CMHOs have been instructed to undertake spraying of anti-mosquito medicines in their respective areas," she added.

[Chikungunya virus is endemic in many parts of India, and sporadic cases occur there frequently. The last cases of chikungunya virus infection reported by ProMED-mail were in 2007. Although the local health department is criticized in the above report for failure to prevent monsoon-related diseases, control of _Aedes_ mosquito vectors of the virus is difficult.
