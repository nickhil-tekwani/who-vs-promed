[The updates above summarize the cases of avian influenza A/H7N9 reported since the last update. As per the summary of week 14 [week ending 5 Apr 2017] available on the FIC website at http://www.flu.org.cn/upfile/attachment/2017411155959722.pdf, 10 confirmed cases were reported -- 8 male, 2 female -- with one fatality in Fujian province. According to the summary, 5 of these 10 cases presented with severe pneumonia.

In a seroprevalence study conducted by Lin and colleagues, the authors concluded that "by estimating the number of human infections with influenza A(H7N9) virus in Guangzhou between January 2014 and April 2014, we were able to show that most infections are not associated with severe disease, which is consistent with the interpretation of mild H7N9 cases detected through ILI surveillance." (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5097368/).

It is a matter of concern that a large number of mild infections have occurred, which indicates that H7N9 has had many opportunities to acquire specific adaptations needed for efficient transmission between humans. - Mod.UBA
