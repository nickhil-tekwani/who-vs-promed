Information on West Nile Virus
1. General disease description
This virus has caused hundreds of cases of encephalitis, myocarditis and
respiratory difficulties; especially serious in the elderly. A 1974 epidemic
in the ordinarily arid Karoo region of South Africa involved a probable
30,000 cases, and was due to heavy rainfall and consequent large populations
of Cx. univittatus. Although West Nile virus infection in man is widespread,
the morbidity rate is relatively low since it is of considerably less
virulence than JE, SLE or MVE. Severe cases of encephalitis occur
occasionally, but the subclinical/clinical ratio is very high. In parts of
Africa, up to 70% of the human population may possess antibodies.
2. Epidemiology
West Nile virus has been reported from much of Africa, the Near East, the
USSR, parts of Europe, India and Indonesia. Wild birds are the primary
hosts, but high antibody rates in a wide variety of other animals, including
man, domestic fowl, large domestic animals, monkeys and chimpanzees,
indicate a broad infection spectrum. In Egypt, Cx. univittatus and Cx.
antennatus are vectors. In South Africa, Cx. univittatus is also an apparent
vector. Other vector associations indicated by isolation of virus from
field-collected specimens include: Central African Republic, Cx. weschei;
Uganda, Mansonia metallica; India, Cx. vishnui, Cx. quinquefasciatus,
Anopheles subpictus; Israel, Cx. univittatus, Cx. molestus, An. coustani;
France, Cx. modestus; and Czechoslovakia, Aedes cantans. In the more
tropical parts of its range, it is possible that this virus could be
maintained by continual transmission, particularly if some of the great
variety of non avian animal species known to be susceptible actually enter
into the transmission chain. Its mechanism of annual
recurrence in the more temperate regions is still unproved, but introduction
by migrating birds has been suggested.

Re: West Nile in humans.
A good description of disease associations is given by Curtis Hayes (1988)
in The Arboviruses: Epidemiology and Ecology Ed T.Monath CRC Press. vol 5
p60- 88
I've taken the liberty of abstracting a few lines:
"In general clinical disease in man caused by West Nile virus is usually
mild with a rapid onset of a not particularly high fever, Malaise, frontal
headache, pain associated with eye movement and muscle pain, are common.
Some patients had gastrointestinal disturbances and a sore or congested
throat. Prominent signs include enlargement of lymph nodes and a
maculopapular rash. Convalescence frequently prolonged. (This is based on
reports in the 1950's)
It seems likely that West Nile may also cause more severe symptoms in a few
cases: mild meningeal and also severe meningoencephalitis (Israel 1962,
1981) and fatal encephalilitis (India 1984). West Nile has also been
isolated in patients suffering fron severe clinical hepatitis in the Central
African Republic (1985).
