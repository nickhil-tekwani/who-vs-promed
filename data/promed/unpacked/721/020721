[1] Cholera - Iraq: WHO update

New laboratory confirmed cholera cases reported during 22-28 Oct 2007
- Kirkuk: 28 (of 479 samples tested) 6 per cent
- Sulaymaniyah: 39 (of 660 samples tested) 6 per cent
- Erbil: 24 (of 487 samples tested) 5 per cent

As of 28 Oct 2007 (week 43), 28 districts of Northern Iraq and 16 districts
in the south and center have reported laboratory-confirmed cases of
cholera. In northern Iraq, 13 out of the 14 districts of Sulaymaniyah
governorate, all 5 districts of Kirkuk governorate, 6 of 7 districts of
Erbil governorate, and 4 districts in Dahuk. As for the center and south;
the affected districts are: 3 districts in each of Baghdad, Tikrit, Mosul,
and Diyala; 2 districts in Basra as well as one district in each of Wasit
and Anbar. The results of the samples of _Vibrio cholerae_ isolates from
Sulaymaniyah were received by the USA Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3
(NAMRU-3) laboratory, Cairo. NAMRU-3 results confirmed Sulaymaniyah- and
Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL) results, showing _Vibrio cholerae_
O1 El Tor Inaba.

99 per cent of Iraq's cholera cases were reported from Kirkuk,
Sulaymaniyah, and Erbil, northern Iraq. Sporadic cases with definite
history of travel and food consumption in Kirkuk were reported from Tikrit
province; however, isolated cases with no epidemiological link to northern
Iraq were also confirmed in Mosul, Wasit, Baghdad, Anbar, and Basra.

One of the important features in this outbreak is that most of the cases
seen have mild to moderate signs and symptoms. The traditional signs and
symptoms of severe dehydrating diarrhoea were seen only very occasionally,
out of the 4467 laboratory-confirmed cholera cases; 22 deaths were
reported, most of the deceased had other serious underlying morbidity.

Specific control measures to contain this ongoing outbreak and limit its
spread to other areas have been reinforced by the concerned governmental
departments of the affected provinces, with technical support from WHO. In
non-epidemic provinces, during the period 14 Aug-28 Oct 2007, 36 cholera
cases were discovered.

[2] Cholera, diarrhea - Nepal
Date: Wed 31 Oct 2007

<http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7009007225>


The Nepalese government on Wed 31 Oct 2007, sounded the alarm on the
recurring diarrhea outbreak in the region, with over 200 people killed and
16 162 cases reported in the 1st 6 months of the year [2007] alone.
According to Dr Manas Kumar Banerjee, project coordinator of Avian
Influenza Control Project under the Epidemiology and Disease Control Unit
(EDCU), the government would implement a massive campaign and operational
research throughout the region to determine the causes behind the "focal
epidemic".

"As such cases have been recurring in Kalikot for a long time, the main
focus of the study will be in the area," stressed Banerjee. The doctor
claimed that the outbreak was mainly due to flooding, landslide, and
rainfall. He explained that 80 to 90 per cent of the problem was due to
contaminated drinking water and 10 to 20 per cent of the cases due to the
consumption of bacteria-contaminated food.

Other identified critical areas for the deadly cholera include Kathmandu
and Nepali districts like Saptari, Rautahat, Chitwan, Humla, Dhanusa,
Mahottari, and Terai.

"Such recurrences have posed a challenge to the government. The cases have
been spreading but it could be brought under control if the people pay
attention to their daily routines, sanitation, and drinking water," Dr
Banerjee said. Poor economic condition in remote communities and lack of
professionals to advise people on health and safety are also big
contributing factors in the outbreak.

[Various reports from Nepal mention cholera, dysentery, and diarrhea. How
much of the total is cholera is unclear but it is clear that many areas of
the country are affected.

The districts mentioned in the posting can be found on a map of Nepal at
<http://ncthakur.itgo.com/map04.htm>. The districts represent 4 of the 5
regions of Nepal with only the far western district not mentioned. Both
Kalikot and Humla in the Western region, however, border on it. - Mod.LL]

[3] Cholera - Viet Nam: (northern provinces)
Date: Wed 31 Oct 2007

The Ministry of Health announced Tue 30 Oct 2007, that a dangerous acute
diarrhea epidemic has been reported in the capital city of Hanoi and some
northern provinces. The fatality rate of which may reach 50 per cent
without timely treatments. Deputy minister of health Trinh Quan Huan said
that since 23 Oct 2007, many patients have been hospitalized with the
identical symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, and water exhaustion.

Most of them were cured at private consulting rooms or grassroots health
stations but when transferred to central hospitals in Hanoi, they were
diagnosed with dangerous acute diarrhea. The number of patients is
reportedly 33 so far, who come from 11 districts in Hanoi and some from the
provinces of Ha Tay and Vinh Phuc. They are being treated in the
Hanoi-based hospitals of Tropical and Contagious Diseases, Bach Mai, Dong
Da and 198.

According to the Hanoi Department of Health, up to 90 per cent of these
people ate raw food, such as mam tom (shrimp paste). Dr Trinh Quan Huan
said that pathogens in raw food makes patients have loose bowels and vomit
continuously, causing serious water and electrolyte loss. If they are not
treated soon, 40-50 per cent patients may die due to cardiac collapse. The
agent now resists some antibiotics like tetracycline and chloramphenicol.
The major treatment method is still water and electrolyte replacement.

The Hanoi People's Committee has banned the use of shrimp paste at
restaurants. The Ministry of Health also warns northern people to not eat
half-cooked food, especially shrimp paste, raw seafood, goi ca (made of raw
fish and vegetables), and fermented pork roll.

The Health Ministry worries that with food as the primary source, the
disease can be scattered. Without timely measures, it can develop into
widespread epidemics and spread to other provinces.

[4] Cholera - Viet Nam: (northern provinces)

In the past, Viet Nam had small and scattered diarrhea epidemics. The
current diarrhea epidemic is the most dangerous so far, said Nguyen Quang
Thuan, director of the Media Centre of the Health Ministry Thu 1 Nov 2007.
By the end of 1 Nov 2007, around 200 patients of acute diarrhea were
hospitalized and 36 of them were reported as "dangerous acute diarrhea" by
the Health Ministry.

In Hanoi, the disease attacked 12 of 14 districts, mainly Hoang Mai and
Thanh Tri. Head of the Preventive Health Agency Nguyen Huy Nga said that
the epidemic is more easily spread in Hanoi's suburbs where most people
don't have access to tap water. The agency has asked water supply plants in
the city to increase chlorine to ensure clean water.

In the coastal city of Hai Phong, the disease has appeared in the districts
of Le Chan, Hong Bang, Ngo Quyen, and Kien Thuy with 4 "dangerous acute"
cases detected on 1 Nov 2007.

Thuan said that the Health Ministry hasn't announced this as a national
epidemic yet because it is currently restricted to only 5 northern
provinces, Hanoi, Ha Tay, Vinh Phuc, Hai Phong, and Hung Yen only. The
Health Ministry Thursday [1 Nov 2007] issued guidance for diagnosis and
treatment of this disease. It is caused by _Vibrio cholerae_.

According to health experts, all of the patients contracted the disease
from food. Of these cases, experts have found around 40 types of the
_Vibrio cholerae_. They resist most old antibiotics but can be destroyed by
new ones.

[The potential case fatality rates given and the possibility of dramatic
dehydration as mentioned in the 1st posting certainly suggest that the
outbreak is or is highly suspected to be cholera. The later posting seems
to confirm this but what is meant by "40 types" is unclear.

[5] Cholera, refugee camps - Congo DR: (North Kivu)
Date: Thu 1 Nov 2007

<http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL01449778.html>


A cholera outbreak in Congo's eastern city of Goma is raising fears of an
epidemic among tens of thousands of refugees in camps, aid workers said on
Thursday [1 Nov 2007]. Fighting between government soldiers, Tutsi
insurgents, Rwandan Hutu rebels, and local Mai Mai militia has forced more
than 370 000 to flee villages in North Kivu province in 2007 alone.

More than 45 000 displaced people now live in 5 overcrowded camps on the
edge of Goma where aid agencies are struggling to maintain minimum hygiene
standards.

The medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said it recorded 533
cases of cholera at health centers it supports, in both the camps and Goma,
over the past 6 weeks.

"The main crisis is in the camps around Goma," said Patrick Lavand'homme,
head the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Goma.
Some 189 cases were reported between 24 and 28 Oct 2007, mostly in the
camps for the displaced, he said. 3 people have died from the disease so
far, MSF said.

Leo Jansen, MSF-France's head of mission in eastern Congo, said that while
the outbreak was manageable, it could soon flare out of control because
refugees continue to flood in. "They're in a bad situation. They're
susceptible to cholera. We've seen the number of cases double inside
Mugunga (camp) in recent weeks," he told Reuters. "We are fearing that the
outbreak could be bigger than in other years."

In 1994, nearly one million mainly Hutu refugees fled to Goma from Rwanda
fearing reprisals following a genocide that killed some 800 000 Tutsis and
moderate Hutus. The sudden influx provoked a major humanitarian disaster
and more than 50 000 people died after a cholera epidemic swept through the
camps.
