Anthrax toll rises to 11
------------------------------
Anthrax was responsible for 3 more deaths at 2 farms west of Tatura last
week, bringing the total number of deaths at the properties to 11.
Department of Primary Industries senior veterinary officer George Miller
said no new cases had been reported since Friday, with the incubation
period for both the disease and vaccine at its end.
"The vaccine gets stronger than the disease at about the 10 day mark and
starts to kick in," Mr Miller said.
The initial cases were reported on Thu 11 Mar 2004, after a veterinarian
was called to investigate a possible case of anthrax. Tests confirmed the
disease on Friday and the remaining cattle -- about 120 20-month-old
heifers -- were vaccinated, the farms quarantined for 42 days, and the
infected carcasses burned. The age of the cattle meant there was no risk to
milk production, but Tatura Milk took the precaution of enacting an
isolation zone, with milk from within a 1 km radius undergoing double
treatment.
The last major outbreak in the Goulburn Valley, in 1997, affected 83
properties, took 2 months to clear up, and resulted in the death of 206
animals. The most recent cases were in the same outbreak area of 1997, and
one of the properties had been afflicted by the disease previously, while
the other had not.
The department will continue to monitor the 2 properties.
[This latest report of additional cases unfortunately reinforces the advice
given in the previous report regarding the need to provide antibiotic cover
at the start because of the risk of infected animals incubating disease.
Otherwise, some or all of these will die before vaccination protection
kicks in. Normally all deaths finish within 8 days of vaccination. But the
cost of any such subsequent deaths is higher than using long-lasting
antibiotics, say LA200, waiting 7-10 days, and then vaccinating. - Mod.MHJ]

Not unexpectedly, there were further deaths on one of the 2 farms, making a
total of 11 deaths on Farm 1 and one on Farm 2. The last death was 5 days
ago on day 8 following vaccination. However, the incident remains
contained, and there are no public health or animal health implications
beyond the 2 farms.
In regard to your comments about the use of antibiotics when the index case
has been missed, our experience at Tatura when we tried this in 1997 was
that this did not necessarily stop further deaths. The Sterne vaccine
appears quite sensitive to antibiotics -- in a heavily contaminated
environment, maintaining antibiotic cover until the vaccine becomes
effective in preventing further deaths, is a delicate balancing act that is
not always successful.

[I have had long discussions on those late deaths in 1997 with Andrew
Turner, the then CVO for Victoria. The problem is that those were dairy
cows in milk when they were vaccinated. If any of them were being treated
for mastitis with intramammary antibiotics or under dry-cow therapy, there
would have been enough antibiotics circulating to affect the injected
vaccine and leave them susceptible. The trick is to make sure your animals
are away from the contamination source (e.g., out of the field they were
grazing, or on a different feed, whichever applies) until the benefits from
the vaccination have had time to kick in. - Mod.MHJ]
