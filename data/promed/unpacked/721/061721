Hawaii: West Nile virus human case imported from Minnesota
----------------------------------------------------------
A tourist from Minnesota came to Hawai'i carrying West Nile virus on 29 Sep
2002, but because humans are "dead-end" carriers who cannot transmit the
disease, his case poses no threat, state Health Department officials said
on Wed 27 Nov 2002. Positive results for the virus in a sample of the man's
blood were reported to the department on Tue 26 Nov 2002, but the visitor
has long since returned to Minnesota and has survived the infection.
The virus, which is spreading steadily across the mainland [United States],
is transmitted to humans when a mosquito bites a bird infected with the
virus, then bites a human. But the viremia, or level of the virus, is so
relatively low in humans, they cannot transmit it to other people or back
to mosquitoes, the Health Department said. The man was seen by a doctor
while he was in Hawai'i, with flu-like symptoms he had begun experiencing
before he left Minnesota, where the presence of the virus has been
confirmed. The physician ordered blood drawn to try to identify the
illness, and the results were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). Because the case was "imported," Hawai'i is still
considered to be free of the virus. The department has received dead wild
birds turned in by the public and begun testing them for the virus, as part
of a statewide preventive strategy to keep Hawai'i free of West Nile virus,
state Health Director Bruce Anderson said. If birds do become infected,
that will indicate the virus has arrived in the state in a manner that
could lead to the spread of the disease from birds via mosquitoes to
humans, he said. Tests this week have failed to detect the virus.

Illinois: state leads the nation in number of cases and deaths
--------------------------------------------------------------
Illinois public health officials have announced 4 more deaths caused by
West Nile virus. That brings to 52 the number of people who have died from
the mosquito-borne disease. Illinois leads the nation in cases and deaths.
Public health director Dr John Lumpkin says cold weather has ended the
threat of the disease for this year. But more cases still might be reported
as lab results are verified. Three of the elderly people who died were from
Chicago and one [was] from northern Cook County. Illinois has had 778 cases
of West Nile this year. Next is Michigan with 523 cases, including 41 deaths.

Maryland: blood transfusion related West Nile virus infection death
--------------------------------------------------
A woman's death from the West Nile virus was probably related to a blood
transfusion she received, health officials said on Wed 27 Nov 2002. The
national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has listed the
death as "probable transfusion associated," said John Hammond, a spokesman
for the state health department. Of more than 3300 known West Nile virus
infection cases this year nationwide, about 15 are believed to have been
from blood transfusions, according to the federal Food and Drug Administration.
The 55 year old woman received a kidney transplant at Johns Hopkins
Hospital on 6 Sep 2002; she was discharged on 14 Sep 2002 and readmitted 2
days later. She died on 1 Oct 2002. The patient had received blood from
more than 30 donors, one of whom tested positive for the virus, the CDC and
American Red Cross found. CDC was investigating to see if anyone else
received the tainted blood.
West Nile virus is mostly spread by mosquitoes. Health officials believe it
can also be transmitted through blood transfusions and organ transplants,
but the risk is considered low. Commercial labs and the FDA are still
developing a test to screen blood donations for the virus.

Alabama: suspected fatal West Nile infection of dog
---------------------------------------------------
A dog in Baldwin County has died [as a result of West Nile virus
infection]. It's believed to be the first in the state. The 2 year old
long-haired dachshund bitch that died from West Nile virus infection was an
inside dog, and only went out 3 times a day. She developed a low-grade
fever, did not eat or drink for 5 days, and she began having seizures.
Dr Jerry Bedsole of the Loxley Animal Clinic, sent the dog to Auburn
University, where researchers confirmed [the diagnosis]. "After several
tests, even one that turned up negative," Dr Bedsole says, "another test
came back positive, and we're convinced it was West Nile virus."
Dr Bedsole says that dog owners should not panic, [although] a vaccine
protecting dogs from West Nile virus is not available. It may not be
needed, however, because dogs [tend to be] resistant. The risk of West Nile
virus has passed its peak, thanks to cooler weather.
