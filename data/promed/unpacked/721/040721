As many as 4 new cases of polio have been reported from Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), taking the tally for the current year [2020] to 12.

Though just 39 days of 2020 have passed, Pakistan has already equaled the total number of cases for 2018, in which only 12 cases were reported.

An official of the National Institute of Health (NIH) said on condition of anonymity that the cases of Sindh were reported from Badin and Kambar, while both cases of KP were reported from Lakki Marwat district.

"In Sindh, a 36-month-old girl, resident of Badin district and tehsil, Badin 1 union council, has been infected with the virus of the crippling disease. The other case from the province is of a 42-month-old girl, who is a resident of Kambar district, Miro Khan tehsil, Khabar union council," he said. "As far as cases of KP are concerned, an 18-month-old boy, resident of Lakki MarÂ­wat district, Bettani tehsil, Ghundi Hassan Khel union council, has been paralysed due to poliovirus. The other child from the province is a 9-month-old girl, who is also a resident of Lakki Marwat district, Serae Naurang tehsil, Kot Kashmir union council."

It is worth mentioning that a total of 144 cases were reported in the year 2019 as compared to 12 cases in 2018 and only 8 cases in 2017.

[Cases continue to occur in Pakistan. One other media report pointed out that with 12 newly confirmed cases in the 1st 40 days of 2020, it averages out to approximately one newly confirmed case every 3rd day. A sobering statistic. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh provinces seem to be the most heavily involved, although cases have also been reported from Punjab.

As a reminder, there has also been identification of an outbreak of cVDPV2 in 2019, although no newly confirmed cases have been identified as yet with onset of paralysis in 2020.
