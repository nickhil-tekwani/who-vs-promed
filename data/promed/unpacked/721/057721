Health authorities in Paraguay today [4 Mar 2008] confirmed 4 new
cases of yellow fever (YF) in a jungle area, bringing to 20 the
number of patients this year, of which 10 died.

Deputy Minister of Health Antonio Barrios told reporters that "The
new infections are in the department of San Pedro where the disease
initially reappeared." That place is in jungle 220 km [136.7 miles]
north of Asuncion and 400 km [248.5 miles] from the border with the
Brazilian state of Mato Grosso where the mosquito infestation index
exceeds 40 percent according to reports.

Antonio Arbo, director of the national emergency plan for YF
vaccination, explained that the residents of the department of San
Pedro generally refuse to receive the injection because they say they
"cannot stand the side effects such as severe headache, nausea and
high fever." [These are *not* frequent effects of YF vaccination. -
Mod.JW]. "But we are doing everything possible to ensure that people
understand that yellow fever can only be fought in 2 ways: with the
vaccine and by eliminating standing water where mosquitoes breed --
the female in just 40 days of its life lays eggs 3 times" he added.

New infections are treated in public hospitals in Asuncion and are
out of danger.

Barrios specified that of the 10 dead, only 4 "were autopsied; the
rest not, because there was no permission from the family." However,
all the deceased had symptoms and signs of the disease: jaundice
(yellow skin), liver and kidney insufficiencies, high fever, severe
headaches and nausea.

In the records of the Pan American Health Organization and the World
Health Organization only 4 dead appear because autopsy is a
requirement laid down in international conventions. [Not so;
confirmation by recognized lab tests is sufficient. - Mod.JW]

Between January and February [2008] Paraguay received 3 million doses
of vaccine from the international community, and has already
immunized approximately 2 million people. Immunizations continue to
be given for free in the public hospitals throughout the country.
