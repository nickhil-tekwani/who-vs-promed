As happened in 2007, contact with crayfish in some areas of Castile and Leon because of their appreciated gastronomic value, appears to be related to some cases of human tularemia infection. At least 3 of the 5 cases of tularemia in Palencia are related to the freshwater crustacean, and there are 7 other patients who have symptoms of the infection caused by _Francisella tularensis_.

As has also occurred 7 years ago [2007], the infection that is ravaging voles in Tierra de Campos, and especially Palencia, is the primary source of tularemia. In this sense, the crayfish act as a transmitter of the bacterium, acquired from water containing the corpses of voles, rabbits or hares affected by tularemia, to the people who handle the crustacean.

It must be borne in mind that, in the summer, with water flow diminished, the crayfish can be found on or near the shores of the waters where they live, and can more easily come in contact with corpses of vertebrates infected with tularemia [or just the water contaminated by _F. tularensis_ - Mod.LL].

There could be many more cases, since not only the fishing or manipulation of the crayfish are behind the cases of tularemia detected in recent days.

The agricultural organization Asaja Palencia said, "There could be many more in the near future because it is impossible not to come in contact with the voles clogging sprayers, filling the siphons and roaming the field."

The different routes of infection of tularemia cause different clinical pictures in the affected, although with a common denominator: fever, pain and discomfort. The chief of the territorial service for health of Castile and Leon in Palencia, Carmen Andres, explained that "in the 12 cases detected we have everything, ulceroglandular forms from direct contact and forms involving the respiratory tract."

[This report relates to a parallel outbreak in Spain linked at least in part to crayfish exposure in Spain:

Anda P, Segura del Pozo J, Diaz Garcia JM, et al: Waterborne outbreak of tularemia associated with crayfish fishing. Emerg Infect Dis. 2001; 7(3 Suppl): 575-582.

Abstract:
"In 1997, an outbreak of human tularemia associated with hare-hunting in central Spain affected 585 patients. We describe the identification of _Francisella tularensis_ biovar palaearctica in a 2nd outbreak of ulceroglandular tularemia associated with crayfish (_Procambarus clarkii_) fishing in a contaminated freshwater stream distant from the hare-associated outbreak. The 2nd outbreak occurred 1 year after the 1st."

Crayfish, also known as crawfish, crawdads, freshwater lobsters, or mudbugs (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayfish), are freshwater crustaceans resembling small lobsters, to which they are related; taxonomically, they are members of the superfamilies Astacoidea and Parastacoidea. They breathe through feather-like gills and are found in bodies of water that do not freeze to the bottom. Some species are found in brooks and streams where there is fresh water running, while others thrive in swamps, ditches, and rice paddies. Crayfish feed on living and dead animals and plants.

Castile and Leon (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castile_and_León) is an autonomous community in northwestern Spain. It was constituted in 1983, although it existed for the 1st time during the 1st Spanish Republic in the 19th century. It is the largest autonomous community in Spain and the 3rd largest region of the European Union. Its location on a map can be seen at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castile_and_León. - Mod.LL
