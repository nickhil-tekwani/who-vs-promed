Abstract
--------
Tilapines are important for the sustainability of ecological systems and serve as the second most important group of farmed fish worldwide. Significant mortality of wild and cultured tilapia has been observed recently in Israel. The etiological agent of this disease, a novel RNA virus, is described here, and procedures allowing its isolation and detection are revealed. The virus, denominated tilapia lake virus (TiLV), was propagated in primary tilapia brain cells or in an E-11 cell line, and it induced a cytopathic effect at 5 to 10 days postinfection. Electron microscopy revealed enveloped icosahedral particles of 55 to 75 nm. Low-passage TiLV, injected intraperitoneally in tilapia, induced a disease resembling the natural disease, which typically presents with lethargy, ocular alterations, and skin erosions, with more than 80 percent mortality. Histological changes included congestion of the internal organs (kidneys and brain) with foci of gliosis and perivascular cuffing of lymphocytes in the brain cortex; ocular inflammation included endophthalmitis and cataractous changes of the lens. The cohabitation of healthy and diseased fish demonstrated that the disease is contagious and that mortalities (80 to 100 percent) occur within a few days. Fish surviving the initial mortality were immune to further TiLV infections, suggesting the mounting of a protective immune response. Screening cDNA libraries identified a TiLV-specific sequence, allowing the design of a PCR-based diagnostic test. This test enables the specific identification of TiLV in tilapines and should help control the spread of this virus worldwide.

"Introduction
-------------
Tilapines are the 2nd most important group of farmed fish worldwide, with production of 2.5 million tons annually, and they serve as a primary protein source in the developing world. The Sea of Galilee (Kinneret Lake) is a major source of potable water and supports commercial fishing. In recent years, the catch fish quantities have been subjected to a persistent decline. Interestingly, although the lake hosts some 27 species of fish (19 of which are native), encompassing members of the families Cichlidae, Cyprinidae, Mugillidae, and Claridae, only a catch cutback of tilapines (Cichlidae) is striking. For the main edible fish of the lake, _Sarotherodon galilaeus_ (Tilapia, St. Peter's fish), annual yields decreased from 316 tons in 2005 to 51, 8, and 45 tons in 2007, 2009, and 2010, respectively.

Being a grazing fish, _S. galilaeus_ contributes to the maintenance of the ecological balance of the lake. Hence, beyond its economic impact, the significant decline of St Peter's fish populations, as well as the other lake tilapines (such as _Tilapia zilli_ [common tilapia], _Oreochromis aureus_ [blue or Jordan tilapia], and _Tristramella simonis intermedia_) represents a definite threat to the entire ecosystem.

The reasons for the decline have not been thoroughly investigated. The transient increase in tilapia catches during 2011 to 2012 (100 and 160 tons, respectively) probably represents an improvement in fishing technologies (such as, sonar-guided fishing and angling in growing depths) rather than a true greater recovery of this species, as in 2013 catches dropped again to 140 tons.

Starting in the summer of 2009, episodes of massive losses of tilapia were recorded in fish farms all over Israel. These outbreaks, observed during the hot seasons (May to October), were distinguished by waves of mortality of tilapia with a wide weight range, spreading from one pond to the other. Interestingly, fish morbidity and mortality remained restricted to tilapia (_Oreochromis niloticus_ X _O. aureus_ hybrid); several species, reared in community with tilapines (including carp [_Cyprinus carpio_] and Gray mullet [_Mugil cephalus_]),showed no clinical symptoms of the disease found in tilapia, even after long-term cohabitation. Moreover, once the initial wave of mortality ceased, no more outbreaks were recorded in the same pond. No apparent reason for the mortality was identified. Routine monitoring of known parasites, bacterial and viral pathogens, and toxins did not reveal any abnormalities and did not resolve the enigma. Attempts to identify emerging viral pathogens of tilapines in diseased fish, such as the herpes-like tilapia larvae encephalitis virus (TLEV) and the viral nervous necrosis (VNN) betanodavirus, were unsuccessful. However, heightened surveillance has led to the recognition, both in open waters and in farm ponds, of weakened fish with black discoloration, skin abrasions, and ocular degeneration. A histological analysis of these fish revealed the presence of augmented melanomacrophage centers (MMCs), denoting an ongoing pathological course.

To elucidate the cause(s) of these changes, we set up an investigation aiming to (i) culture and identify a probable infectious agent and explore its role in triggering disease and (ii) to develop a diagnostic tool for its monitoring."

"Discussion
-----------
A serious emerging disease in wild populations of tilapine species in the Sea of Galilee, including _S. galilaeus_, _T. zilli_, _O. aureus_, and _T. simonis intermedia_, and in the pond-raised hybrid tilapia _O. niloticus_ X _O. aureus_ in Israel led to the current studies of infectious etiology. The association of disease outbreaks with seasonality (May to October, when the water has relatively high temperatures) further indicates the involvement of an infectious agent, since water temperature affects the emergence of a wide range of parasitic, bacterial, and viral diseases of fish.

Here, we report the isolation of a previously undescribed virus, TiLV, from spontaneously diseased fish and the induction of disease in tilapia by this agent. The incubation of extracts from diseased but not healthy tilapines with cultures of fish cells (E-11 and primary tilapia brain cells) resulted in the appearance of CPE [cytopathic effect] in infected cultures. Moreover, the inoculation of supernatants, harvested from these cultures, into naive tilapines resulted in the appearance of disease. TiLV was reisolated in cell cultures from experimentally infected fish, and this agent might induce a similar disease upon inoculation of new naive fish. Furthermore, an experimentally induced disease might be achieved with a purified TiLV obtained by endpoint dilutions. Of note, the signs of the naturally occurring disease (discoloration, skin patches, ocular alterations, and lethargy) were also observed in the experimentally induced disease. The TiLV sequences were amplified from diseased fish and TiLV-infected cell cultures but not from naive fish, mock-infected cultures, or cultures infected by another agent (VNN). Altogether, Koch postulates were fulfilled for this agent.

Several lines of evidence indicate that this infectious agent is a virus. First, the agent was through 0.22-m filters while retaining its infectivity, ruling out the possibility of infection by microorganisms larger than this filter size (such as bacteria and fungi). Second, the appearance of CPE after serial passages of the agent in cell cultures excludes the possibility of a filterable toxin-induced CPE. Third, virion-like structures were visualized by EM [electron microscopy] in infected cells and in the supernatants of cultures of these cells. Fourth, CPE activity was demonstrated for relatively dense fractions of sucrose gradients, similar to known assembled virions. Fifth, the encapsidated TiLV genome is made of RNA, as evidenced by the fact that it was amplified by RT-PCR only (and not by PCR) from samples of sick fish and from cell cultures that were inoculated with extracts of such fish, as well as by the fact that this amplification was sensitive to initial digestion with RNase I. RNA genomes are only known to occur for viruses. EM analyses and the sensitivity of TiLV to organic solvents (ether or chloroform) further suggest that TiLV is an enveloped virus.

TiLV-induced disease in tilapines was achieved either by i.p. [intraperitoneal] injections or by cohabitation; the cohabitation mode of transmission demonstrates the ability of TiLV to spread by the waterborne route. It should be noted that in these experiments, relatively high mortality rates were observed for both the i.p. and waterborne routes. This is in line with the extensive mortality observed in commercial ponds but not with the less extensive mortality observed in the Sea of Galilee. The possible explanation for this difference relies in the fact that our experimental system and commercial ponds represent a "closed community," in contrast to the Sea of Galilee, which resembles an "open community." The spread and outcome of diseases in the commercial ponds are usually much more severe than in the Sea of Galilee.

Examples for the influence of the environmental conditions on disease progression include piscine rhabdoviruses, in which classical acute hemorrhagic septicemias may change to subacute, chronic, or
nervous forms, and these are seldom difficult to visualize and monitor in open waters. Likewise, the influence of harsh husbandry conditions in close community on the severity of the disease was documented for VNN.

The existence of fish that survived the TiLV-induced disease strongly suggests that an effective immune response against this pathogen can be mounted. This has important applications for future disease containment strategies. Besides the possibility of vaccine development, the determination of the susceptibility of different tilapia species to TiLV should be considered a measure of disease containment. This notion is based on the well-documented differences in disease resistance among species of the same genus. Examples include a wide range of susceptibilities for viruses infecting salmonids or for VNN resistance in Atlantic halibut (_Hippoglossus hippoglossus_) populations. Overall, fish that survive TiLV may establish a core of broodstock that can prevent the killing of the whole population. Indeed, survivors of piscine rhabdoviruses that developed adaptive immunity allowed with time the selection of rhabdovirus-resistant strains.

This work also provides an initial molecular characterization of TiLV that includes cloning a portion of its genome. Notably, this clone possesses an ORF [open reading frame] with no similarities to those of published sequences. This further suggests that TiLV is a new emerging pathogen for tilapia. In light of the extensive commercial production of tilapia, and seeing as tilapia serve as a primary protein source in the developing world, it is highly important to diagnose this new pathogen. The amplification of TiLV sequences from diseased fish and TiLV-infected cultures, described in this work, provides the basis for a PCR-based diagnosis, allowing prompt screening, surveillance, epidemiological studies, and disease containment." - Mod.AS
