"Many countries in Asia have encountered highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtypes such as H5N1, H5N2, H5N6, H5N8 as well as the highly pathogenic H7N9 which resulted in outbreaks in 2018-2019. These outbreaks impacted animal and public health, trade, and economy in affected countries. Human infections with zoonotic influenzas -- especially avian influenza virus H5N1 and H7N9 -- have occurred in countries in Asia since 2003, causing a serious public health threat."
