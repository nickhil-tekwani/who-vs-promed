A horse that died nearly a month ago has been confirmed as carrying a potentially lethal disease for both humans and horses.

The North Bay/Parry Sound District Health Unit has been informed by Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Public Health Ontario of a dead horse in the Sundridge area testing positive for eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEv).

The risk of a person being infected with EEEv remains extremely low. There has never been a human case of EEEv reported in Ontario or Canada, although it has been identified in horses and mosquitoes.

Eastern equine encephalitis is a virus that causes inflammation of the brain. It is acquired when bitten by an infected mosquito. Horses or people infected with EEEv cannot spread the disease.

In 2015, the Health Unit's mosquito surveillance program had no mosquito pools test positive for EEEv. The last time our district had a positive EEEv mosquito pool was 5 years ago, in the Parry Sound District.

You can reduce the risk of being infected by EEEv during active mosquito season by doing the following:
- Cover your skin when outside by wearing long pants and loose fitting shirts with long sleeves.
- Use insect repellent containing DEET. The concentration of DEET should be no greater than 30 percent for adults, no greater than 10 percent for children and should not be used on children under 6 months old.
- Eliminate standing water on your property as this is where mosquitoes lay their eggs.

[It seems 1 of 2 things is happening: either it is a slow news day to report on a deceased horse a month after the incident, or the lab was very slow in confirming the cause of this death. To be fair, we do not know what samples were sent to a lab, or what sensitivities exist around the location, but it still remains an oddity.

By now, early November, we hope a freeze has eliminated the mosquitoes. If not, horse owners should already have their horses vaccinated and continue to use fly and mosquito repellent specifically designed for horses. - Mod.TG
