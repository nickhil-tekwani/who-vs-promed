Tests of dead birds that were smuggled in from China found they were
infected with the H5N1 virus, but officials said the risk of an
outbreak was low.
With a possible outbreak of avian flu looming, some healthcare
workers wearing isolation gowns participated in a ceremony announcing
the establishment of Taipei City's "disease prevention and control
mobilization corps" yesterday at Taipei Municipal Hoping Hospital.
8 of the 1037 birds that were smuggled into Taiwan from China on a
ship have tested positive for the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus, but an
outbreak is unlikely, as they have been seized and destroyed,
officials said yesterday.
At a press conference yesterday, Council of Agriculture (COA)
officials said that 8 of 276 dead birds discovered on a
Panama-registered ship by the Taiwan Coast Guard in Taichung Harbor
on 14 Oct 2005 were tested and found to be carrying the H5N1 virus.
The 1037 birds on board were smuggled from China last week, raising
concerns over the risk of bird flu being brought to Taiwan.
Officials said they did not know where the ship was heading, but had
received information about it from an undisclosed source.
19 types [species] of birds were found on board the ship, with 3 --
myna birds, black-naped orioles and Chinese nightingales -- found to
be carrying the H5N1 virus.
According to Chao Parn-hwa, director of the Animal Health Research
Institute, 8 of the 276 dead birds were sent to the institute for
inspection. All 8 [randomly picked samples] were found to have the
H5N1 virus, Chao said.
Meanwhile, noting that the birds were smuggled from China, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs last night called on Beijing to adopt
transparent measures in its actions against bird-flu to avoid
becoming a "loophole" in other countries' efforts to combat outbreaks.
In Taichung, one crew member from the ship, a Chinese national, is in
quarantine and is being interrogated. The remaining 24 crew members
left Taiwan with the ship on Monday.
Officials said that the quarantined crew member had no symptoms and
is taking Tamiflu, the most effective bird-flu medication available.
A 40-person team that searched the ship and destroyed the birds was
not quarantined, as team members had worn protective gear and did not
come in direct contact with the infected birds, officials said. But
they are being monitored as a precaution, the officials added.
Watson Sung, director-general of the Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health Inspection and Quarantine, said that the bureau will combat
animal smuggling and advises the public to call 0800-039-131 or 118
to report smuggling to the coast guard.
Smugglers face up to 3 years imprisonment and a TWD 150 000 [USD
4400] fine. Officials are considering tightening the smuggling law.
"All the birds on board the ship have been destroyed. Bird flu has
not spread into Taiwan and we are not an infected zone," Sung said.
Meanwhile, as part of efforts to combat a possible avian flu
outbreak, Taipei Municipal Hospital yesterday [20 Oct 2005] announced
the establishment of a "vanguard team" of 108 hospital staff that
will be stationed at Hoping Hospital should an outbreak occur.
The 108 doctors, nurses and other hospital staff from 6 municipal
hospitals will be stationed at Hoping Hospital, which has been
designated the anti-avian flu center for the city.
Officials hope to gain from the hospital's experience during the SARS
outbreak of 2003.
At a ceremony to announce the team's establishment, Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou said the city has been working on the preventative measures
for more than 6 months, and he hoped that with the team, the city
would be able to prevent situations such as the SARS outbreak from happening.

A group [consignment] of smuggled birds that was stopped off the
coast of Taiwan and destroyed on the spot 5 days ago tested positive
for the H5N1 strain of the bird flu, the government announced
yesterday as it reported Taiwan's 1st case of the virus which has
killed 60 people in Asia.
A total of 1037 birds along with a number of mice and turtles had
been found on a Panama-registered ship traveling from China by the
Coast Guard Administration (CGA) last Friday off the coast of Taichung harbor.
Members from the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and
Quarantine (BAPHIQ) proceeded to board the ship and destroy the
animals, half of which were already dead, after collecting samples of
their excretions for further testing on Sat [24 Oct 2005].
All of the ship's crew had been ordered to leave the country on their
ship on Sunday except for one who was detained by authorities in
Taichung for allegedly attempting to smuggle the animals into Taiwan.
The suspected smuggler, who according to local media brought the
birds from Fuzhou [of Fijian province], mainland China, has been in
good health and showed no signs of being infected by the virus so
far, BAPHIQ said. He will be receiving medication.
Members of CGA and health workers from BAPHIQ who had been in direct
contact with the infected birds have also been reported to be in good
health but are taking no chances.
A total of 31 members of the CGA are ordered to take their body
temperatures twice a day and to report on where they had gone during
the day. They will continue to do so for the next 5 days, said the CGA.
9 health workers from BAPHIQ who took part in destroying the animals
had all followed the necessary precautionary procedure before
boarding the ship such as wearing protective clothing and masks as
well as undergoing a sterilization process. Nevertheless, their
health condition will be monitored by the Center for Disease Control
and local health authorities in the coming days.
"There is no need for the BAPHIQ workers to be quarantined as they
had already taken precautionary measures," said BAPHIQ section chief
Chiang Hsien-tsong.
Despite discovering Taiwan's 1st case of the deadly bird flu, BAPHIQ
Director General Sung Hua-tsong said that people should not panic.
"We are still not listed as an infected country since the virus was
stopped outside of our borders and have not entered the country," said Sung.
As smuggled products have been on the rise in Taiwan, so has the risk
of the nation being infected by contagious viruses carried by
animals. BAPHIQ said that it has destroyed 81.68 tons of animal
products smuggled from abroad this year as well as 5146 animals,
including 5070 birds.
BAPHIQ called on the public not to bring live animals or their
related products from abroad and to report to authorities any
suspicion of smuggling activities.

[The above reports carried some significant features: (1) the illicit
consignment from an endemic zone (China in this case) was intercepted
by the coast guard on a ship prior to landing in Taiwan; (2) the
content of the H5N1-infected cargo was effectively destroyed and
precautionary measures were taken to protect all the concerned
parties; (3) genetic characterization of the H5N1 virus isolated from
this incident showed that it shared 96 percent homology with the
virus derived from yet another smuggled consignment of ducks in
Kinmen (just offshore of the Fujian province of China, but governed
by Taiwan) from China during the 2003 SARS period; (4) the virus
isolated shares 99 percent homology with the H5N1 virus currently
circulating in Fujian; and (5) H5N1 virus was found in Japan in a
shipment of frozen duck meat from Shandong province of China in 2003
(see archive 20050714.2008). - Mod.RY]
