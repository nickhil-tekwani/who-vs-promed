The Ministry of Health said on 4 Dec 2007 that human brucellosis
continues to increase in China and case numbers in Heilongjiang are
particularly high. The Ministry of Health has asked all locales to
strengthen prevention work.
Statistics from the Ministry of Health show that China's prevention
and control of human brucellosis is in serious circumstances, and
occurrence in cow and sheep producing regions is a grave [concern]. A
trend has emerged in which the disease is spreading from herding and
semi-herding regions to farming regions and even urban areas. Other
than Chongqing, Guizhou, and Hainan, all provinces and
centrally-administered municipalities have reported human
brucellosis. The top 10 provinces and autonomous regions by number of
cases are Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Hebei, Shaanxi,
Jilin, Liaoning, Xinjiang, Henan, and Shandong, which together
account for 98.15 percent of reported cases nationally. By the end of
September 2007, there were a total of 18 116 brucellosis cases in
2007 nationally, an increase of 2.6 percent over 2006's 17 644 cases.

[Brucellosis is considered to be a Category B bioterrorism agent
which is, in nature, acquired as a zoonotic infection by humans. Its
manifestations are protean, including undulant fever, with positive
blood and/or bone marrow cultures, and it is a cause of localized
disease in many organ systems including skeletal, urinary tract,
central nervous system, liver, cardiac and lung. The reader is
referred to Young EJ. Human brucellosis. Rev Infect Dis 1983; 5:
821-39 for a review of these manifestations.
The following is part of a narrative from ProMED-mail "Brucellosis -
China 20041222.3371" written by Mod.AS:
"A detailed review, 'Epidemiology and control of brucellosis in
China,' was published in December 2002 by Shang Deqiu, Xiao Donglou
and Yin Jiming (Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, Chinese
Academy of Preventive Medicine, Beijing) in Veterinary Microbiology
90, 1-4, pp 165-182. Based on the analysis of 3425 _Brucella_ strains
isolated from humans and animals in 21 provinces, the data revealed
73.79 per cent infected with _B. melitensis_, 13.64 per cent infected
with _B. abortus_, 5.78 per cent infected with _B. suis_, 0.05 per
cent infected with _B. ovis_ (which is generally not regarded as
zoonotic!), and 6.70 per cent infected with atypical _Brucella_
strains. For the entire country, _B. melitensis_ was the predominant
strain associated with outbreaks, but there were some differences
from province to province, for example _B. suis_ in Guangxi and _B.
abortus_ in Sichuan were the predominant strains isolated. In most of
the epidemics, the predominant strain was _B. melitensis_, with
either _B. abortus_ and/or _B. suis_."

Heilongjiang province is found in the extreme northeastern part of
the country. - Mod.LL]
[Brucellosis in man is acquired in 2 ways: occupational disease,
affecting mainly those in direct contact with infected animals
(particularly during parturition or following abortions), and the
food-borne disease route, affecting consumers of unpasteurised milk
and dairy products originating from infected animals. While in
herding, semi-herding and animal-farming regions, both routes
prevail, in urban regions the predominant route of infection is the
food-borne one. The latter can be reduced or prevented by proper
pasteurisation of the (cow, sheep and goat) milk. Preventing
brucellosis in rural population requires controlling, preferably
eradicating the disease in the animal populations involved, applied
on a regional or rather national levels. Brucellosis control
programmes are costly, laborious and of long duration; they require
the full cooperation of the animal breeders, and usually would
include 2 main activities: test-and-slaughter, and/or vaccinations.
There are several kinds of brucellosis animal vaccines, targetting
the different species. - Mod.AS]
