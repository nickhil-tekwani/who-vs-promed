A fresh infectious poliomyelitis case was detected in Afghanistan, bringing to 9 the number of confirmed cases of polio virus since January this year [2018], the Afghan Public Health Ministry said [Mon 2 Jul 2018].

"A new polio virus case was registered in Pir Mohammad village, Nad Ali district of southern Helmand province recently," the ministry said in a statement.

According to the statement, the paralyzed 4-year-old boy had never been vaccinated, as the area his family lives in is behind the reach of health workers and polio vaccinators.

Earlier on [Mon 2 Jul 2018], the ministry launched a 5-day polio vaccination campaign in 27 of the country's 34 provinces, which will wrap up [Fri 6 Jul 2018].

The ongoing insurgency and conflicts have been hindering the efforts to stamp out the infectious disease in the mountainous country as over 1.3 million of children under the age of 5 would be deprived from the fresh vaccination, according to the statement.

Polio virus could be rapidly transferred and the only preventable way was vaccination, the statement added.

The latest anti-polio campaign launched by 53 000 dedicated polio workers would deliver oral polio vaccines to over 6.5 million children.

[As stated in the above media report, this newly confirmed case makes 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 associated polio reported from Aghanistan since 1 Jan 2018. Prior to this current case, the most recent case of polio reported by Afghanistan had date of onset of paralysis on 27 Apr 2018 and occurred in Kandahar province. Recent reports of environmental samples in Afghanistan were released in the week ending 22 Jun 2018 when there were reports of 2 environmental samples positive for wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1); 1 collected in Kandahar on 28 May 2018 and one in Jalalabad district, Nangarhar province, also on 28 May 2018. The most recent report of a positive environmental sample for WPV1 in Helmand province came on the week ending 31 Jan 2018; 1 sample was collected in Lashkargah district, Helmand province on 26 Dec 2017; and on 8 Jan 2018, 1 sample was collected from Lashkargah district, Helmand province.

Map of Helmand Province districts https://tinyurl.com/ybvs8oev showing Lashkargah district is directly to the east of Nad Ali district, suggesting the WPV1 has been circulating, perhaps quietly, in this province (Helmand) for the past 6 months. Results of genetic testing on the isolated virus will be very helpful in addressing this supposition.
