Prompted by the discovery of 5 animals with sylvatic plague, Los Angeles
County health officials temporarily closed a popular nature park near
Pasadena and stepped up efforts to find and destroy infected animals.
Three infected squirrels were found in the Eaton Canyon Park north of
Pasadena and a fourth infected squirrel at Table Mountain, an Angeles
National Forest camping area near San Bernardino County.
The fifth animal, a 5-month-old kitten, was found roaming the Rancho Mirage
mobile home park in Lancaster, where it was apparently fed by a resident
before being turned over to a nearby animal shelter last month.The cat is
believed to have been destroyed.
Sylvatic plague, when transmitted to humans, is commonly known as bubonic
plague, a bacterial infection that can be fatal if not treated, said
Jonathan Fielding, director of public health and the county's health officer.
But he said such occurrences are extremely rare and the last case of
animal-to-human infection in Los Angeles County was reported in 1984.
As a precaution, county officials closed Eaton Canyon Park on Tuesday for
at least 10 days. County workers will set up 40 to 50 dust stations to kill
fleas, which carry the plague among animals, and will exterminate 90% of
the ground squirrels, which officials say are the most common carriers of
the plague in the Los Angeles area. Fielding said the measures were
necessary because the park is heavily used by picnickers and hikers. It
contains the Eaton Canyon Nature Center, which draws hundreds of children
and adults on weekends and is home to dozens of nature organizations.
At Table Mountain, the discovery of the infected squirrel required no
extraordinary measures because it coincided with the camping area's normal
annual closure, county officials said.
The Lancaster cat, however, has prompted additional concern because there
have been no such cases among domesticated animals since the late 1980s,
said Frank Hall, chief of the Department of Health Services' vector
management program. Vectors are animals or insects that can transmit
disease to humans.
"We're concerned about where this cat came from," Hall said. "Did it have a
previous owner?"
County health officials said they are investigating areas near the
Lancaster trailer park to determine the extent of the plague infestation.
The woman who fed the cat showed no signs of bubonic plague, Hall said.
Tracy Bryant, Rancho Mirage trailer park's resident manager, said the
county only informed her Wednesday afternoon about the infected tabby. "The
county is suppose to be coming out tomorrow. We'll be informing all our
residents about the cat."
The latest sylvatic plague cases were discovered during a routine sampling
of animals in shelters and wilderness areas by county health officers.
Bubonic plague, once known as the "Black Death," is believed to have wiped
out as much as a third of Europe's population during the 14th century. But
with advances in preventive methods, only about 10 or 15 cases are now
reported annually in the United States. Still, county health officials are
urging the public to take precautions.
People should stay away from wild or stray animals and use insect repellent
against fleas, Hall said. Even healthy-looking animals can harbor the
disease, and pet owners should try to keep their animals flea-free and
indoors.
