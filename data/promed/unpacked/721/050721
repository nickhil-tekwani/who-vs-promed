VSV-NJ - NEW MEXICO (USA) (4)
===============================

Update on the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus-New Jersey (VSV-NJ)
Outbreak in the Western U.S.
This update is excerpted from the twentieth through the
twenty-fifth weekly vesicular stomatitis outbreak updates
distributed by the United States Department of Agriculture:Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service:Veterinary Services
(USDA:APHIS:VS). The index case in the 1995 VSV-NJ outbreak (a
horse in New Mexico) was laboratory confirmed on May 6, 1995.
Positive premises were later identified in Arizona, Colorado,
Utah, and Wyoming.
As of December 1, 1995, all VSV-affected premises in New Mexico
had been released from quarantine. New Mexico had 186 positive
premises quarantined during the 1995 VSV-NJ outbreak. As of
December 4, 1995, all VSV-affected premises in Wyoming had been
released from quarantine. Wyoming had eight positive premises
quarantined . As of December 13, 1995, all VSV-affected premises
in Utah had been released from quarantine. Utah had six positive
premises quarantined. As of December 20, 1995, Colorado had
three positive premises.
The VSV outbreak in the San Luis valley of Colorado is subsiding.
Spread to adjacent premises in the San Luis valley has not been
observed. Preliminary reports on three of the 16 cows that
were infected with VSV and subsequently died indicate that these
were older animals with nephrosis and uremia at the time of
death. This suggests the possibility of pre-existing, diminished
renal function exacerbated by VSV-induced debilitation. The
Colorado State University diagnostic laboratory has not found
evidence that VSV was the primary cause of death in these
animals. Preliminary results from seroprevalence studies being
conducted in Colorado estimate 10-15 percent clinical prevalence
and 75-80 percent seroprevalence. These studies are being
conducted on both cattle and horses.
It seems to have become a widely held belief that once there is a
killing frost, the threat of VSV is over. This belief comes from
the fact that transmission via insect vectors is greatly
decreased when cold weather eliminates many of the insects.
However, VSV is also transmitted via contact with infected
animals, and this mode of transmission is not decreased with a
killing frost. The current outbreak is winding down, but it is
still active.
Some countries are requiring negative VSV tests for animals to be
imported. For further information on trade restrictions, please
contact your federal veterinarian or the National Center for
Import and Export in Riverdale, MD, (301) 734-8590.
Several U.S. States have movement restrictions for livestock and
wild or exotic animals originating from affected States. State
requirements are available via the Regulation Retrieval System or
the Voice Response System (1-800-545-USDA).
