RUBELLA - MEXICO/CENTRAL AMERICA: REQUEST FOR INFO
**************************************************
A ProMED-mail post
Date: Tue, 7 Apr 1998 17:02:04 -0600 (CST)
From: James Perdue <James.Perdue@tdh.state.tx.us>

**************** The Immunization Division, TDH, is
interested in learning of ongoing rubella activity/outbreaks
recognized in Mexico/Central America. ProMED-mail readers with specific
knowledge of rubella activity/outbreaks in Mexico or Central America
are requested to e-mail Ms. Laura Tabony, TDH Immunization Division,
at: <laura.tabony@tdh.state.tx.us> **********************
The Immunization Division, Texas Department of Health (TDH), in
conjunction with the US Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS),
has investigated an outbreak of rubella among detainees (from Mexico
and Central America) at the INS Detention Facility in Port Isabel,
Cameron County, Texas (southern-most county in Texas, borders
Tamaulipas State, Mexico). Rubella has been rare in Texas, with only
eight (8) cases reported in each of 1995 and 1996, for a rate/100,000
of < 0.1 cases/100,000 population; Texas' population is roughly 19
million.
A TDH "Rubella Alert!" dated March 30, 1998, states in part:
"Twenty-one cases of rubella have been confirmed in a federal
Immigration & Naturalization Detention Facility in Port Isabel,
Texas...The first case occurred on November 30, 1997, and the most
recent experienced rash onset on March 26, 1998. Twenty (20) cases
are detainees of Hispanic ethnicity who came from El Salvador (5),
Honduras (7), Guatemala (5), and Mexico (3). They ranged in age from
18 years to 31 years; median age was 20 years. One case was an
unvaccinated employee working in the clinic. In addition to the 21
cases that have been confirmed within this facility, three cases have
occurred in neighboring communities-one case in Brownsville (Cameron
Co) and two cases in San Juan (Hidalgo Co)...Furthermore, outbreaks
of rubella are known to be ongoing in several Mexican states..."
With the rapidly approaching Easter/Semana Santa holiday, large
numbers of people are expected to cross the border between Texas (and
other US border states) and Mexico, visiting family, etc. throughout
Mexico (and perhaps countries in Central America), and subsequently
returning to Texas/the US.
