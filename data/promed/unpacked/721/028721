[Note: "Dropsy" has historically in the US been a term for congestive
heart failure, however, epidemic dropsy is a disease causing epidemics in
India and Mauritius; marked by fever, anemia and skin changes. Mortality
has been up to 10% with causes thought to include both nutritional
deficiency and contaminated mustard - CM]
Adulterated mustard oil causes epidemic dropsy
----------------------------------------------------------
A large number of patients, including children, are being admitted to the
Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narain Hospital after having eaten food prepared in
adulterated mustard oil.
For the last three days, cases of epidemic dropsy -- caused by mustard oil
contamination -- have been reported from many parts of the city. If not
treated on time, this condition can lead to paralysis and even death.
Fifty-four patients have also been admitted to the Lady Hardinge Medical
College with similar symptoms. The condition of some patients were stated
to be critical.
A doctor on duty explained this condition as epidemic dropsy which was
caused due to the adulteration of the mustard oil by a toxic compound,
sanguarina.

[Although ProMED-mail's primary mission is to report outbreaks of emerging
infectious diseases, we include outbreaks due to toxins also. Can anyone
tell us what sanguarina is, & why it is used to adulterate mustard oil? -
