[This immediate notification officially confirms the information communicated in the ProMED-mail report archive number 20150820.3591203. Although the outbreak was resolved, the event is still continuing. New outbreaks could be detected.

The aetiological agent of crayfish plague is _Aphanomyces astaci_, a member of a group of organisms commonly known as the water moulds. Although long regarded to be fungi, this group, the Oomycetida, are now considered protists and are classified with diatoms and brown algae in a group called the Stramenopiles or Chromista.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, and references please refer to the OIE Aquatic Manual 2015, Chapter 2.2.1 Crayfish plague (_Aphanomyces astaci_) at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.2.01_CRAYFISH_PLAGUE.pdf

OIE's internationally agreed requirements pertaining to crayfish plague (_A astaci_) are spelled out in chapter 9.1 of OIE's Aquatic Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=171&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_aphanomyces_astaci.htm

Infected animals may show clinical signs; however, infection may be present in the absence of any signs. Pictures of lesions of crayfish plague can be seen at http://library.enaca.org/Health/FieldGuide/html/cp001cra.htm
