>From January to May [2011], local health authorities investigated
more typhus cases than they did during the same period last year
[2010] and in 2009, another indication that the once-rare disease is
now establishing itself in Central Texas. In 5 months, the
Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department tallied 8
probable and confirmed reports of murine typhus, not counting 2 others
still under investigation. That compares with 5 probable and confirmed
cases last year [2010] from January through May and 6 during that same
period in 2009.

Given the small numbers, the increase isn't statistically
significant, said Carole Barasch, health department spokeswoman. But
after 4 years of annual outbreaks of murine typhus, it's now clear the
illness, which can be fatal, is endemic in Travis County, and
residents need to take precautions, she said.

Murine typhus is a flea-borne disease that commonly occurs in South
Texas, California, and Hawaii, with most cases reported from May
through September. It is spread by fleas from rats, opossums, dogs,
cats, and raccoons. Humans contract it when an infected flea bites and
leaves its feces on the bite wound. Symptoms include high fever,
headache, chills, vomiting, nausea, muscle pain, and rash.

Patients generally respond to antibiotics, but some must be
hospitalized. 2 patients have been hospitalized this year [2011]; none
died, Barasch said.

Cases this year have been reported in 4 ZIP codes -- 78722, 78703,
78704, and 78751 -- and patients have ranged in age from 13 to 56, she
said. For all of last year [2010], the health department reported 14
confirmed and possible cases of typhus in Travis County; in 2009,
there were 35 such cases, she said.

A lack of rain can prompt animals to seek alternative water sources,
possibly near dwellings and people. The health department advises that
the public use flea control measures to protect themselves and their
pets. Those steps include feeding pets indoors to avoid attracting
wild animals to the neighborhood; clearing heavy undergrowth and
debris from yards to keep animals from nesting; wearing long sleeves,
pants, socks, and shoes when outside; and using insect repellents
containing the active ingredient DEET.

Statewide, the number of reported murine typhus cases has increased
dramatically between 1998, when there were 45, and 2007 -- the most
recent year for data -- when there were 169. That jump is the result
of health officials more actively looking for cases, the state's
website says.

[_Rickettsia_ are small obligate intracellular parasites that are
maintained in animal and arthropod reservoirs and transmitted by
arthropod vectors (ticks, fleas, lice, or mites) to humans. Murine
typhus, which occurs throughout the world, is a flea-borne rickettsial
disease caused by the _Rickettsia typhi_. Rats are the primary animal
reservoir of _R. typhi_; however, other mammals, such as free-ranging
cats, dogs, and opossums and their fleas can maintain this
microorganism in areas where rats and rat fleas are absent (Azad AF,
Radulovic S, Higgins JA, et al: Flea-borne rickettsioses: ecologic
considerations. Emerg Infect Dis 1997; 3(3): 319-27; available at
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627639/).

Humans are usually infected by contact with infected flea feces,
either by inoculation into excoriated fleabites, inhalation, or
ingestion. Symptoms include fever, headache, chills, vomiting, nausea,
myalgias, and rash. The illness usually resolves within 3 weeks, even
if untreated. However some patients are sick enough to be hospitalized
in an intensive care unit and up to 4 percent of hospitalized patients
will die from the infection. Treatment is doxycycline. Prevention is
directed at control of flea vectors and animal reservoirs.

Murine typhus occurs in the USA in southern Texas, southern
California, and Hawaii. In 2008, 33 laboratory-confirmed cases of
murine typhus occurred in Austin, Texas (see ProMED-mail post Murine
typhus - USA (04): (TX) 2008-2009 20091120.3995). Illness ranged from
mild to severe, with 73 percent of patients requiring hospitalization.
Environmental investigation at the time suggested that opossums and
domestic animals likely played a role in the maintenance and spread of
_R. typhi_. Murine typhus is a reportable condition in Texas, and
health-care providers are required to report any suspected cases to
the local health department through the National Electronic Disease
Surveillance System within one week of detection.
