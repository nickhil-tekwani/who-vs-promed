[1] South Africa (Eastern Cape): human case suspected

The Department of Health in the Eastern Cape says every single dog bite should be attended to due to the current outbreak of rabies. A spokesperson for Health Sizwe Kupelo says this follows the death of a teenager who was admitted to the Uitenhage Provincial Hospital on Easter Friday [15 Apr 2022].

He says the patient had no visible dog bite, but it later transpired that he was bitten a month prior to being admitted. Kupelo says the child has since died and his body was handed over to SAPS [South African Police Service]. According to police, Despatch [small town in the Eastern Cape] detectives have opened an inquest, and a post mortem will be conducted to confirm whether the 14-year-old boy had died from rabies.

The current outbreak in the Eastern Cape is still not under control, and according to the South African Veterinary Association, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Dr Renee Van Rheede Van Oudtshoorn spoke to Algoa FM saying that vets were more concerned about rabies than COVID because there is no cure for rabies. She says all animals can transmit rabies to humans but in most cases, it is from our pets. "You don't have to be bitten by a rabid dog, you can be licked or scratched, because it is transmitted through saliva" she added.

All residents should ensure that their pets are vaccinated. You can contact the state vet to find out about free vaccination stations or visit your local vet.

Abstract
--------
More than 430 cases of rabies have been confirmed in dogs in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality of South Africa since July 2021. We describe the ongoing outbreak, its geographical spread and 6 related human deaths that have occurred. Further investigation of the outbreak and vaccination of the dog population is required. Raising awareness among healthcare providers, the public, and among international travellers planning to visit the region, is key for action to protect human and animal health.

[Nelson Mandela Bay (Eastern Cape Province) comprises the City of Port Elizabeth and smaller towns of Uitenhage, Despatch and Colchester, all administratively governed by the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality (see map at <tinyurl.com/54rmfp8h>).

The Eurosurveillance article includes the following subject sections:

1. Rabies surveillance in South Africa
2. Identification and evolution of the outbreak (including Figure 1 presenting weekly evolution and Figure 2 presenting geographic distribution)
3. Control measures taken
4. Specimen collection and education of animal and human healthcare professionals
5. Public awareness and dog vaccination campaigns are key to human rabies prevention
6. Identification of the causative strain

The paper's 2 final sections, the Discussion and Conclusions, follow (references omitted):

Discussion
----------
"From 2008 to 2018, an average of 10 human cases were reported nationwide annually, and in 2021, 19 human cases were confirmed. Rabies has been confirmed only occasionally in the past in NMBM [Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality] in dogs or wildlife, but no rabies was confirmed in dogs in 8 years prior to this outbreak and a human case has never been confirmed in the region. The distribution of human rabies cases is known to overlap with the distribution of canine cases and -- as humans and dogs often live in close proximity -- a rabies outbreak among dogs poses an increased risk to human public health. Awareness is key then, for dog owners to have their dog vaccinated and for the local health system to manage dog bites and suspected human rabies cases, and to correctly deliver timely post-exposure prophylaxis.

"Up to 13 Feb 2022, there are early signs that the outbreak is stabilising but anecdotally, some dogs are being euthanised based on presumptive diagnoses without samples taken for laboratory confirmation; the true scale of the outbreak is probably underestimated. Indeed, underdiagnosis and under-reporting may also be a problem. Reports of increased canine deaths were received by welfare organisations earlier in 2021, but these were initially attributed to distemper, a canine infectious disease caused by a paramyxovirus, which causes similar clinical symptoms, namely pyrexia, gastrointestinal and neurological signs. These could in fact have been undiagnosed rabies cases and possibly the outbreak evolved earlier."

Conclusions
-----------
"The scale of this ongoing outbreak of rabies in dogs in NMBM is unprecedented, and further investigation and control measures are necessary to protect both human and animal health. Port Elizabeth is on South Africa's 'Garden Route', a highly popular tourist destination. In line with current guidance, travellers to the region should be advised to avoid contact with dogs, to seek medical advice if bitten or scratched by a dog or other mammal while in South Africa. Additionally, for travellers who plan a prolonged stay, or who will potentially have contact with dogs or wildlife, rabies vaccination should be considered before arrival."
