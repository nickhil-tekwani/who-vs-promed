Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease in Malaysia: Update
----------------------------------------------
PETALING JAYA: The State of Johor, which reported the first death due to
hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) early this month, has declared that
there is now an outbreak [of HFMD in the State. Between Monday and
Wednesday, the Johor health authorities said there were 137 cases, which
comprised [approximately 40% of the total cases (362) reported for the
whole year. On Wednesday alone, 50 new cases were reported with 17 patients
[admitted to hospital. A total of 2 HFMD-related deaths have been
reported: a child from Johor who was visiting relatives in Kedah a week
ago, and another at the Universiti Hospital in Petaling Jaya yesterday. The
State of Johor ordered the closure of all kindergartens and play areas in
the State capital. Johor Health Director, Dr P. Senan Pillay, said that by
closing kindergartens and child-care centres, they hoped to cut contact
among children so that the virus would have no new host to spread to and
would fade out on its own. He told reporters yesterday that the department
had requested general practitioners to report cases found in private
clinics, because the department's statistics relied on returns from 17
public hospitals and clinics and cases elsewhere may be missed.
In neighboring Negri Sembilan, 4 patients were admitted [on Wed 11 Oct
2000 to the Seremban Hospital, bringing the number of cases in the state
to date to 28.
In Alor Star, a 30-month-old boy, who came for a visit a month ago with his
parents from Johor, died at the government hospital last week of suspected
HFMD. State health director said yesterday the boy died on 7 Oct 2000, a
day after he was diagnosed as having the disease, but laboratory
confirmation was still awaited [despite blood samples having been submitted
for testing on 6 Sep 2000. The child was admitted with his one-year-old
brother, who also developed fever and rashes. The brother was discharged a
few days later, however. Last Sunday, a 15-month-old boy was admitted to
the Alor Star Hospital and the authorities claimed that he was Kedah's
first [indigenous HFMD case. The boy's condition was stable and he was
expected to be discharged soon.
Universiti Malaya Medical Centre director Prof Amin Jalaludin said there
had been "a spate of [suspected cases" of HFMD during the past 6 weeks.
Samples from a young patient at Universiti Hospital [indicated infection
with a strain identical to [sic Enterovirus 71 (EV71). The 2-year-old
boy, referred from a private hospital on Wednesday, died at about noon
yesterday. The victim, said Prof Amin, had not been in Singapore in the
last 2 weeks and his case appeared to be unrelated to the outbreak reported
in the Republic. Prof K.B. Chua, from the Universiti's Microbiology
Department said that a 5-year-old patient from Klang, who had shown the
same enterovirus symptoms [sic, had recovered and been discharged on 7 Sep
2000.
The Centre had determined that the virus responsible was not EV71 or
Coxsackie virus A16. He told reporters that it may be a new strain of
enterovirus. He explained that Coxsackie virus A16 is the most common agent
[associated with HFMD, which is endemic in the country, and infection is
usually mild. EV71 was found to be responsible for the HFMD outbreak in
Sarawak in 1997. Prof Chua said the strain of enterovirus extracted
[isolated? by the Universiti Hospital team seemed to be related to EV71.
However, there are currently 68 types of virus classified in the genus
_Enterovirus_, and Malaysia does not have facilities to identify over 20 of
these.

[This press report does little to clarify the identity of the virus
responsible for this outbreak. The only conclusion that can be drawn on the
present reports is that Enterovirus 71, or an Enterovirus 71-like virus, or
an entirely different virus, but not apparently Coxsackie virus A16, the
most likely agent, may be responsible for this outbreak. Use of the
undefined term "strain" adds to the confusion. There are 63 serotypes of
enteroviruses currently recognized, excluding the 3 polioviruses. In the
USA, the National Enterovirus Surveillance System (NESS) records the
frequency of isolation of the different enteroviruses. The 15 most common
serotypes, which includes Enterovirus 71, account for 89-98% of all
isolates each year (during the period 1997-1999). The second most frequent
report among the 15 (at 13.1%) is serotype unknown. Consequently, while the
results from NESS may not be directly applicable to the situation
elsewhere, any identification of a causative agent based on one or a few
tests must be viewed with caution. Further information direct from the
laboratories concerned may help to clarify the situation. - Mod.CP
