Cause of catfish tumors still unknown
-------------------------------------
The mystery of why South River catfish are turning up with skin tumors
remains just that: a mystery.

A new study found the culprit is not a group of toxins called PAHs
[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons] that often cause tumors in fish.
The cause may be a virus or other contaminant, according to the lead
researcher, Fred Pinkney of the US Fish and Wildlife Service's
Chesapeake Bay Field Office in Annapolis.

"If you read detective stories, I imagine we're trying to sift through
the evidence," Pinkney said. "Sometimes they give it up easily,
sometimes you have to work on them."

The tumor-ridden brown bullhead catfish were first documented in the
South River in 2004 after they were found during a separate survey
involving other fish. More than half of the fish collected then had
unsightly tumors growing around their mouths and 20 percent had liver
tumors.

Catfish riddled with such tumors in the Chesapeake Bay region had been
prevalent in only the heavily contaminated Anacostia River.

A team lead by Pinkney collected more catfish between 2004 and 2008 to
assess the problem. One sampling of South River catfish was not enough
to declare a serious problem, Pinkney said. In the additional samples
from the South River, between 19 percent and 58 percent of fish had
tumors, mostly around the mouth. That validated the findings from
2004, when 53 percent of fish had skin tumors.

"We definitely have a problem with the fish. It's consistently high
for skin tumors in the South River," Pinkney said. The rate of liver
tumors in South River catfish decreased, from 20 percent in the
original sample to 0 to 6 percent in the additional samples,
indicating that liver tumors are less of a concern.

Fish also were collected in the Severn, Rhode, and Choptank rivers for
analysis. The Severn had a wide range of fish with skin tumors (2
percent to 52 percent). A few Rhode River catfish had skin tumors (6
percent) and almost no skin tumors were found in Choptank catfish.

Scientists performed a variety of tests on the fish, including looking
at their DNA, to determine the cause of the tumors.

They did not find a correlation between the tumors and the presence of
polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs], chemicals found in gas, oil,
coal, car exhaust, and runoff from highways.

They also didn't find a link between the tumors and another group of
chemicals called alkylating agents.

Because brown bullhead catfish live and eat at the bottom of rivers,
they can be affected by toxins such as PAHs and alkylating agents that
latch onto sediment particles.

Pinkney's team's findings will be published in the journal Science of
the Total Environment.

Diana Muller, the riverkeeper for the South River Federation, said
anglers often find the tumor-laden catfish, especially in the northern
reaches of the river near a waterskiing area. She wonders if the
tumors could be caused by old landfills that leach contaminants into
groundwater.

"We definitely have to do more research as to why. If it's causing
cancer in the catfish, what else is it doing?" Muller said.

[Skin tumors in fish have been found to be caused by viruses and
contaminants. Similar incidence of oral/dermal and liver tumors in
fish were observed in other chemically contaminated waterways. These
tumors have also been reported in other species, such as walleye
(_Stizostedion vitreum_), redhorse sucker (_Moxostoma_ sp.), white
sucker (_Catostomus commersoni_), and bowfin (_Amia calva_).
Observational studies that cover several rivers comparing the tumor
incidence of different contaminant loads will certainly shed some
light. See also a report by the US Environmental Protection Agency at
