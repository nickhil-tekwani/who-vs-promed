Rhinopneumonitis Death in Michigan
Veterinarians at Michigan State University are looking into a possible
outbreak of rhinopneumonitis which reportedly caused the death of one
yet-unidentified Standardbred, and the quarantine of 25 other horses.
The animal was said to have died as the result of contracting the viral
disease, which is caused by a herpes virus.
It is highly infectious and can cause respiratory infection, paralysis, and
death in horses.
Two of the horses who reside in the barn are reportedly running a high
fever, and samples from those horses will be diagnosed at Michigan State
University.
The Michigan Office of Racing Commissioner and the State Department of
Agriculture are coordinating the investigation of this possible outbreak.
According to the Web site petcaretips.,net, Rhinopneumonitis occurs in
horses of all ages but is more common in horses less than 3-Years-Old.
Sporadic outbreaks come from inhalation of the virus particles.
After incubation of 2 to 10 days, signs for the respiratory subtype are a
fever of 102 to 107 degrees, Fahrenheit, accompanied by a bacterial
infection, or "snots."
In addition, recovery provides immunity for only 2 to 3 months.

[Rhinopneumonitis is a viral disease caused by a herpesvirus. It may
present as a severe respiratory infection, but it may also cause a
neurological disease, or abortion in pregnant mares. There is a vaccine for
it. The immunity inferred from the disease or the vaccine, are relatively
short. Horses on the show or racing circuit are often vaccinated every 6
months. - Mod.TG]
