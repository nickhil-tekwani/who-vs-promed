Malaria spreads in east China province
-------------------------------------------
Malaria is spreading in east China's Anhui Province, which reported 17 917
cases by 25 Sep 2006 (this year), according to the provincial health
department. The malaria cases increased by 89.8 percent from the same
period last year, said the department. The cases were mainly reported in
Bozhou, Huaibei, Suzhou, Bengbu and Fuyang in the north of the province.
Malaria cases have been on the rise since 2000 in these areas, according to
the department. The department has issued an emergency notice asking local
government authorities to strengthen the monitoring of the epidemic and
promote the prevention and treatment knowledge among people to curb its spread.
A check on malaria prevention and control in the disease-hit areas will be
carried out in the 1st 20 days of this month [October 2006], said the
notice. Those officials whose lax supervision caused a spread of the
disease will be severely punished, according to the department. China
reported 39 656 malaria cases in 2005, 45 of whom died, according to the
Ministry of Health.

[Anhui province is regarded as a low risk area for malaria in China. We
presume that all cases are _Plasmodium vivax_. It is a cause for concern
that malaria is returning to an area previously regarded as very low risk.
The CDC does not recommend malaria prophylaxis to visitors to Anhui Province
<http://www.cdc.gov/travel/regionalmalaria/eastasia.htm#malariarisk>,
and more information is needed before recommendations to travelers might be
changed.
A map of malaria in China for 2001 can be found at
<http://www.actmalaria.org/downloads/pdf/info/2004/China.pdf#search=%22Malaria%
20%2BChina%22>;
it shows Anhui Province as having 0 to less than 1 case per 100 000
inhabitants. ProMED will be happy to publish newer data if available. - Mod.EP]
