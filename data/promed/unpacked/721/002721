Do you think we should initiate a periodic sampling of our cullinary water
for legionellosis? Our policy is to maintain 120 deg. water throughout the
facility except in peds and TCU which are at 110 deg.
We have had no previous indications of problems and do not have any hot
water storage tanks. Our water heaters are flow through design and heat the
water on demand. We also have a recirculating system which keeps most of the
piping with water circulating constantly rather than standing still. Let me
know what you think.

I am aware of the fact that ProMed is not intended to prevent outbreak of
diseases, but one can learn from the history.
Re: (drinking)watersafety
Any drinking water supplying system (old or new) should be (re-)DESIGNED to
be SAFE. Tubing which is no longer used should be removed immediately or
adapted to make free flowing possible.
In case of already occurred contamination or even dangerous situations the
following steps are to be taken:
-- 0) start with chlorination to control the risk. Be aware that the active
chlorine dose is still effective at those, sometimes far away places, where
the water is really used.
Cheap indicators are available for checking.
-- 1) Inspect the system for stagnation possibilities, (mixing)valves,
corrosion and build-up of chemical and organic origin. Special attention has
to be taken to prevent relative vacuum in the system (i.e. at moments where
at some place a great amount
of water is used). Exemple: suck up of waste water through hoses hanging in
dirty water is possible...!
-- 2) remove or clean and/or replace
-- 3) disinfect the sytem
-- 4) prevent contamination of the tubing system (UV disinfection etcetera)
The best way to organize these action is to do a thorough HACCP analysis. In
many cases you will conclude that there are lots of Critical Control Points.
In that case the system should be RE-designed in order to eliminate these
CCPs (build-in safety).

Regarding the diagnosis of legionellosis: the legionella urine antigen test
is both sensitive and specific in detecting serogroup 1 disease (70-90% of
all cases of legionellosis) and remains positive for weeks after infection.
This often neglected diagnostic test has great potential utility.
