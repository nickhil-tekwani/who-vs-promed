After a period of abnormal, heavy rainfall and floods in the Eastern African region, an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) was 1st reported in humans in Kenya; later it was confirmed that the disease was present in animals. These outbreaks are ongoing and pose a threat to the whole Eastern African region. Although the upcoming [dry] season from July 2018 onwards will be unsuitable for the vector populations in most of the Eastern African region (except for Ethiopia, South Sudan, and southern Sudan), the potential spread of the disease through animal movements and informal trade routes within and outside of Kenya is likely to occur.

Therefore, FAO advises the veterinary services and livestock farmers' communities in the region to remain vigilant to the potential occurrence and spread of RVF in humans and/or animals. In particular, the risk of RVF spread is considered to be very high in Kenya and moderate in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda, and United Republic of Tanzania. In addition, given the current and predicted above average precipitation forecasts for the period June-September 2018, southern Sudan and western Ethiopia may also experience suitable environmental conditions for RVF vector amplification.

The outbreak in Kenya is not the 1st RVF re-emergence in the region: during the past 7 months, RVF infections have been reported in Uganda (November 2017) and South Sudan (December 2017). Informal cross-border movement of livestock, conflicts, and a lack of veterinary services can facilitate the spread of RVF within the affected countries in East Africa.

[The above forecast may have been issued before the lab confirmation of the 1st RVF case in Uganda on 29 Jun 2018. This event involved a human patient; no animal cases have been reported there yet.

According to earlier reports from Rwanda, RVF has been causing disease and mortality in animals since April 2018. So far, this information has not been submitted to the OIE, and no information on diagnostic tests applied has become available. Notably, the FAO Early Warning Bulletin refers to Rwanda as a country in which the risk of RVF spread is considered to be "moderate."

In Kenya, RVF was recorded initially in the Wajir county (within the former North Eastern province) and later in at least 6 additional counties affecting humans and animals. On Thu 5 Jul 2018, the Wajir County government lifted the ban on consumption of meat and milk. The county Health Chief Officer Abdirahman Mathow said the disease has been contained (see at http://www.kenya24news.com/kenya/wajir-lifts-meat-ban-says-rift-valley-fever-contained/35417-news).

In West Africa, precipitation forecast for June-September 2018 predicts above average rainfall in southwest Mali and southeast Niger, which are both endemic countries for RVF. These countries should, according to the FAO, remain vigilant about RVF in the coming months.

The South African region has a low risk of vector amplification because it is entering the winter season, which is cold and dry with low rainfall, and because of the highly localized nature of the current outbreak in South Africa. However, given the fact that the said outbreak is ongoing, the risk of further spread within the country is considered to be moderate due to movement of infected livestock. - Mod.AS
