An outbreak of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) at a Pennsylvania horse barn in March [2021] was caused by a new variant of the H752 genotype, researchers report.

The H752 genotype has the potential to cause neurological disease. This new variant has a particular mutation in the ORF 30 gene, similar to that reported in a recent outbreak from France, the study team reported.

The mutation is at a pivotal nucleotide position which has previously been shown to discriminate between neuropathogenic (D752) and non-neuropathogenic (N752) forms.

Nicola Pusterla and his fellow researchers, writing in the journal Pathogens, described EHV-1 as an important, widespread viral pathogen inducing respiratory disease in young horses, as well as abortions in mares, early death in foals, and occasionally neurological disease.

Although neurological problems are a relatively uncommon consequence, they can cause devastating losses and severely impact the equine industry.

On [9 Mar 2021], 2 of the authors, Julia Miller and Sarah Varnell, visited a 31-horse show barn in rural Pennsylvania to perform routine dental care and vaccination. As part of the health assessments, 10 horses were unexpectedly showing an elevated rectal temperature, even though they all appeared bright and alert. Blood and nasal secretions were collected from the horses with a fever to check for common respiratory viruses, including EHV-1.

Eight out of the 10 horses tested positive for EHV-1. Over the following 35 days, each of the 31 horses was monitored daily for abnormal physiological parameters. Blood and nasal secretions were collected weekly for molecular-based testing for EHV-1, and blood was collected 35 days apart to checked for antibodies to EHV-1.

The horses comprised 14 geldings and 17 mares, aged 1 to 27. Various breeds were represented, including 24 warmbloods, 4 Welsh ponies, 2 thoroughbreds and a thoroughbred/draft horse cross.

[This sounds disturbing on the surface, but perhaps it may be a key to unlock how to make a vaccine for the horses.

It would have been handy if there was a summation of the data collected over the 35 days. Furthermore, the article does not tell us the follow-up outcome of any of these animals. How many showed clinical signs? How many developed a full-blown case of EHV? Did any have to be euthanized? Did they all recover.

So many questions this article fails to address. But it appears it may be the beginning of a study, so perhaps we will yet learn more. - Mod.TG
