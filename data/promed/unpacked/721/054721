Abstract
--------
We constructed an age-to-age infection matrix to characterize the household transmission pattern of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Korea. Among 4048 household clusters, within-age group infection dominated the overall household transmissions. Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 was more common from adults to children than from children to adults.

[According to this study, household transmission occurred in 21% of the cases; with one index case infecting an average of 1.57 household members. Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was more common from adults to children than from children to adults https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32634405/. This underscores the importance of additional awareness targeting the adult population and reappraises the implication of school closure on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the households. - Mod.UBA]

[2] Variants & immunity

The coronavirus variant originally found in Manaus in Brazil and detected in 6 cases in the UK was able to infect 25% to 61% of the people in the Amazonian city who might have expected to be immune after a 1st bout of Covid, researchers say.

The extent to which P1 can evade the immune system, and potentially vaccines, emerged as the UK health secretary said the hunt for one person who tested positive for P1 - but did not leave contact details - had narrowed to 379 households in the south-east of England.

Matt Hancock said 5 people had quarantined at home. The 6th took a home test but did not fill in the necessary form. "Incidents like this are rare and only occur in around 0.1% of tests," he told MPs in the House of Commons. "We've identified the batch of home test kits in question, our search has narrowed from the whole country down to 379 households in the south-east of England and we're contacting each one."

Hancock also said that a 3rd vaccine might be necessary in the autumn, against P1 and similar variants such as B1351, which was 1st detected in South Africa. Both have mutations in the spike protein that can help virus variants escape the current vaccines.

"Our current vaccines have not yet been studied against this variant and we're working to understand what impact it might have, but we do know that this variant has caused significant challenges in Brazil, so we're doing all we can to stop the spread of this new variant in the UK, to analyse its effects and to develop an updated vaccine that works on all these variants of concern and protect the progress that we've made as a nation," said Hancock.

The international team of scientists that detected P1 in Manaus is calling for more genetic sequencing of emerging variants around the world, saying that only with knowledge of how Sars-Cov2 is mutating can the pandemic be brought under control.

The variant, called P1, not only has potential to evade the immune protection of previous illness or vaccines, but is more transmissible than the original coronavirus. The study in Manaus, which has not yet been published in peer-reviewed form, found it was about 1.4 to 2.2 times more transmissible than the original virus.

The scientists said at a briefing that 6 cases, detected promptly in the UK, did not presage a significant spread of the variant. It was vital, however, to identify variants emerging throughout the world in countries that had little or no genomic sequencing capacity at the moment, they said.

The research was carried out by the Brazil-UK Cadde project, whose work on genetic sequencing predates the pandemic. It includes the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Sao Paulo, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and universities in Oxford, London and Birmingham.

Manaus, the largest city in the Amazon basin, suffered a 1st wave of Covid in April/May [2020]. Studies of blood donors suggested 66% of people had antibodies against the virus in July [2020] and 76% by October [2020], which would have been expected to give them immunity. But the city suffered a serious 2nd wave. There could have been various explanations, including the possibility that the data on previous infection was wrong, but the team of researchers identified the P1 variant on [6 Dec 2020]. It spread rapidly: within 8 weeks, it was implicated in 87% of cases.

Dr. Nuno Faria of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, said it had concluded that the variant was causing people who had already suffered from Covid to get it again. "If 100 people were infected in Manaus last year [2020], somewhere between 25 and 61 of them are susceptible to reinfection by P1," he said at a briefing. "We caution, however, that our results from analysis should not be generalised to other epidemiological contexts and/or other variants of concern."

Prof. Sharon Peacock, the director of Cog-UK, the consortium responsible for the genomic sequencing of the virus and its variants, said P1 has spread to 25 countries to date. "It is being distributed around the world. But I would say that in terms of the UK, we have just 6 cases identified, which we heard about yesterday [Mon 1 Mar 2021] from Public Health England, and from the government," she said.

Peacock expressed a note of caution about the findings from Manaus. "We need to see whether this is generalisable to other settings, she said. "So I think it would be wise to indicate that this is relevant to where the study was done, but we don't know how that will pan out in other countries, including the UK.

"The response that we've taken in the UK has been very brisk, and is appropriate, but very vigorous." Public Health England was investigating the 6 known cases of people infected with P1, tracing contacts and taking appropriate action, she said.

The research shows that P1 has 17 mutations and many are similar to those found in the spike protein of the variant found in South Africa, called B1351. In particular, a mutation called E484K that they share appears to enable the variants to escape the immune system, which means that vaccines may have reduced efficacy.

Research by South African scientists suggests that antibodies triggered by exposure to the country's dominant coronavirus variant can prevent infection by other variants, the scientists said on [Wed 3 Mar 2021].

The findings in laboratory studies offer hope that COVID-19 vaccines based on the 501Y.V2 variant 1st identified late last year [2020] could protect against multiple variants circulating in different parts of the world.

The more contagious variant drove a 2nd wave of infections in South Africa that peaked in January [2021] and is believed to have spread to many other countries in Africa and other continents.

"We used plasma ... from people that were infected in this latest wave with the 501Y.V2 and we used it against the 1st-wave virus, ... what we found is that it could neutralise, OK not as well as it could neutralise itself but it's not bad at all," Alex Sigal from the Africa Health Research Institute told a news conference. Sigal said vaccines designed with the 501Y.V2 variant in mind "might be cross-protective to other variants, ... this gives you some idea how this problem of variants can be solved".

Penny Moore, a professor at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, said the antibody response from the 501Y.V2 variant was only reduced 3-fold against the 1st-wave virus, whereas the response from the 1st-wave virus was reduced 9-fold against 501Y.V2.

"It's not that the antibodies that are triggered by 501Y.V2 are somehow magical, there is a drop-off, ... but unlike the antibodies triggered by the original variant they seem to somehow have a little bit more breadth," she told the same briefing.

Salim Abdool Karim, a top government adviser on COVID-19, said major vaccine manufacturers including Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson were already making vaccines based on the 501Y.V2 variant. Moderna had already adapted its shot and was putting it into human studies, he added.

He predicted that by the end of 2021 most vaccine manufacturers would have adapted their shots, "not because they are specifically worrying about the virus coming from South Africa ... but because key mutations in the 501Y.V2 are actually also present in many other variants."

Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said the research was encouraging and that genomics surveillance had helped the government respond to the pandemic.

South Africa has recorded by far the most COVID-19 infections and deaths on the African continent, at 1.5 million cases and over 50 000 fatalities to date.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 has caused over 95 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 2 million deaths worldwide. According to current literature data, older adults have higher risk of severe disease and mortality due to COVID-19. It is also known that older adults often do not present typical symptoms of diseases. The aim of the study was to assess if the prevalence of typical COVID-19-related symptoms varies by age group.

Methods
Medical charts of a random sample of COVID-19 patients dying in-hospital were retrieved through an integrated national surveillance system and reviewed by a group of researchers at the Italian National Institute of Health. Detailed information on COVID-19-related symptoms were extracted and analyzed.

Results
A total of 3241 confirmed cases of COVID-19-related deaths were identified from 4391 reviewed medical charts. The mean number of COVID-19-related symptoms progressively declined with age, from 2.1 in patients aged under 60 years to 1.7 in those aged 90 years or older (p < 0.001). Moreover, fever, cough, and diarrhea significantly declined with increasing age.

Conclusions
Older adults have atypical presentation of symptoms and may be paucisymptomatic. This may lead to a diagnostic and therapeutic delay which aggravates the prognosis of COVID-19. Special attention should be posed when assessing individuals aged 65 years and older with suspected COVID-19.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
COVID-19 differs substantially between individuals, ranging from mild to severe or even fatal. Heterogeneity in the immune response against SARS-COV-2 likely contributes to this. Therefore, we explored the temporal dynamics of key cellular and soluble mediators of innate and adaptive immune activation in relation to COVID-19 severity and progression. A total of 44 patients with a PCR-proven diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. Extensive cellular (leukocytes and T-lymphocyte subsets) and serological immune profiling (cytokines, soluble cell surface molecules, and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies) was performed at hospital admission and every 3-4 days during hospitalization. Measurements and disease outcome were compared between patients with an unfavorable (IC admission and/or death) and favorable (all others) outcome. Patients with an unfavorable outcome had higher leukocyte numbers at baseline, mostly due to increased neutrophils, whereas lymphocyte and monocyte numbers were reduced. CRP, IL-6, CCL2, CXCL10, and GM-CSF levels were higher at baseline in the unfavorable group, whereas IL-7 levels were lower. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were more frequently absent in the unfavorable group. Longitudinal analysis revealed delayed kinetics of activated CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocyte subsets in the unfavorable group. Furthermore, whereas CRP, IL-6, CXCL10, and GM-CSF declined in the favorable group, these cytokines declined with delayed kinetics, remained increased, or even increased further in the unfavorable group. Our data indicate a state of increased innate immune activation in COVID19-patients with an unfavorable outcome at hospital admission, which remained over time, as compared with patients with a favorable outcome.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (85 672) Brazil (74 376), and France (26 788) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 11 349 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 2 Mar 2021 to late 3 Mar 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (10 countries) include Brazil, USA, France, Italy (20 884), India (17 425), Czech Republic (16 816), Poland (15 898), Turkey (11 520), Germany (10 835), and Russia (10 535). A total of 50 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 26 of the 50 countries are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 2 are from the Western Pacific region , and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 1.9%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 4.4%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 7.8% increase in daily reported cases and a 12.4% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: There were more than 465 000 newly confirmed infections reported globally in the past 24 hours with over 115.74 million cumulative reported cases and over 2.57 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts. Importantly, the declining 7-day averages of cases and deaths continue to shift so the 7-day average of daily newly confirmed cases is showing increases and deaths are decreasing less, suggesting the conclusion that advances in slowing the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 are fading and transmission is increasing. - Mod.UBA]
