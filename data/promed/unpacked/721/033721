It is beyond me that people go to such lengths to capture Vampire bats,
smearing coagulant paste on there backs, so you can see which cattle are
bitten. Why not just inoculate them and notch there wings so you know which
ones are inoculated? It seems like such a waste to watch cattle which have
been fed upon by "coagulant treated bats" when you could certainly stop the
disease transmission by inoculating the carriers. Cost of loosing
livestock has definitely not been included in your "cost beneficial"
treatment of this problem.

I think it is important to clarify that there are three methods to control
vampire bat populations, developed and tested in the 1970's in Mexico
through research projects supported by UNDP/FAO, USAID and the National
Institute of Livestock Research of Mexico. These methods are:
1. Capturing vampire bats using nets, spreading an ointment with
anticoagulant in the body and releasing them. When the treated vampires
returns to their roosts they spread the anticoagulant to other vampire bats
and no to other bat species, since the colonies of bats, from different
species, in the same roost (cave, culvert, hollow tree) do not mix. Since
the vampire bats clean themselves with the tongue (like the cats do) they
ingest the anticoagulant. This method is very effective, it was proved that
more than 10 vampire bats are killed out of one vampire captured and
treated, it has the disadvantage that the capturing of the vampires has to
be done by night and has to be done by trained personnel in order to
identify properly all the bats captured and treat only the blood eating
species.
2. The second method is based on the eating habits of the vampire bats.
They prefer to eat on the same cows and on the same sites where the have
bitten, therefore applying the ointment with anticoagulant on the biting
injures of the cattle is effective to reduce the vampire bat population. It
is important to be consistent in the treatment of cattle. The disadvantage
of this method is that you have to hold the bitten cattle in order to apply
the ointment and beef cattle are not tame enough.
3. The third method is based in the fact that cows are much more resistant
to anticoagulants than vampire bats, therefore, by using soluble
anticoagulants it is possible to apply intramuscular injection, with a dose
that is not dangerous for cattle but [for which it was proven that during
the following three to four days, it remains lethal for vampires in the
blood stream of the treated cattle. This is the easiest method to be
applied, since it is easier to hold a cow just to make an intramuscular
injection.
