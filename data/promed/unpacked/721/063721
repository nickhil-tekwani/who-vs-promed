[I had asked Keith for background information on why FMD was continuing in
Wales. - Mod.MHJ
I think there are 2 reasons for continued cases:
1. A continued chain of acute infections, often involving subclinical sheep
infections in areas where close attention had not been paid during the main
phase of the control programmes (3-km cull of sheep), and/or spread to
these "new" areas during the period when the infection was thought to have
been under control - i.e. May-June 2001.
2. To a more limited extent, finding virus on probang tests in flocks
identified as containing antibody positives and culled under the
serological screen in the 3-km zones. Very few seropositives have been
found, so the number of cases attributable to this is low.
The continued chain of acute infections must be attributable to poor
bio-security/segregation of animal holdings, since Donaldson has reported
that the low aerosol infectivity of the virus would require considerable
numbers of infected sheep and cattle to infect over 100 metres from source.
Given that cattle would be picked up quickly, sheep transmission over the
fence is one route that definitely occurs, but the other routes are, as
ever, uncertain.
But biosecurity does become lax, and, as raised on ProMED-mail last week,
the wisdom of pressure-washing dirty vehicles before disinfection is
something I wonder about myself. Sheep shearers etc. may be involved
despite the intended biosecurity on their operations. Hill sheep are
definitely involved, I presume as a chain of acute infections rather than
as shedding from carriers.
I don't have enough information on the Libanus outbreaks [in Wales but I
am told by near-official sources that [they have been put down to
transmission occurring associated with "stress" of shearing sheep brought
down off the hill; not clear to me if they are trying to incriminate
recovered animals or suggesting the spread of acute infection by mixing a
group where infection had continued with previously unexposed animals, or
via the shearer concerned. The evidence for stress reactivating the virus
does not exist, as far as I can find; each experiment using cortisone had
no effect, in fact the converse, it inhibited shedding. I am also told the
seropositives clustered heavily to particular hefts, which is useful
information if we could get this confirmed. The danger zone to me is not
near 100% seropositives, rather some lower percentage which could indicate
continuing infection, or possibly a burnt-out focus.

[I appreciate Keith's providing this information. If anyone has harder
information, it would be appreciated if they would share it with us.
I have been searching for sites providing analytical comment of behalf of
not-vaccinating. When they are available, they will be posted. Peter
