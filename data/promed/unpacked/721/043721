Advice for producers in 3-day sickness outbreak [bovine ephemeral fever]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cattle and dairy producers are being urged to look out for signs of 3-day sickness after an outbreak of the debilitating disease in the Inverell area. Northern Tablelands Local Land Services said numerous cases had been reported around the district, and Tenterfield had been particularly hard hit this year [2018. Otherwise known as bovine ephemeral fever, the virus is usually not fatal but can seriously affect condition, fertility and milk production.

3-day sickness: what you need to know
-------------------------------------
Northern Tablelands LLS district vet Andrew Biddle said the recent outbreak had travelled into the area from the east, spread by biting midges. "It's called 3-day sickness because animals that are infected typically show clinical signs for 3 to 5 days," Dr Biddle said. "The animals develop a temperature in response to the virus and this is the cause of many of the clinical signs. They appear depressed and lethargic and are reluctant to move around. When encouraged to stand or move around, they'll often appear as if they're lame in one leg or stiff with an uncomfortable gait. They will also often drool from the mouth. Animals tend to just lie down." Outbreaks normally occur in waves every 4 to 5 years.

Dr Biddle said one of the biggest risks was animals lying down for prolonged periods, and it was important to keep encouraging them to stand up. "Because they're large animals, they sit with their legs tucked under them, and they develop a muscle weakness and an inability to actually get up," he said. "So they may recover from 3-day sickness, but they're essentially cast, or down, and can't get up again."

What can be done?
-----------------
Early intervention with anti-inflammatories may help to alleviate the joint and muscle pain that causes animals to lie down for extended periods. Dr Biddle said producers with cattle already on the ground should provide easily accessible water and good-quality hay to maintain the animals' health. Producers could consider vaccinating bulls against the virus to protect their breeding potential, although it was probably too late in the current outbreak.

Dr Biddle said that if 3-day sickness was suspected, producers should act immediately. "It's being vigilant, monitoring the health of stock and, if they're concerned, contacting their veterinarian or Local Land Services for more information," he said.
