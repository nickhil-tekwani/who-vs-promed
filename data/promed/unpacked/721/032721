Within less than a year [ProMED post 20201203.7990992], the devastating "potato wart" disease was detected for the 2nd time on Prince Edward Island.

The disease was first discovered in seed potatoes, but studies were inconclusive. Now, just 7 months later, it was found again, this time in fields of potatoes for processing. The new detection, in a totally different set of fields and totally different type of potatoes going into a different part of the supply chain, has raised a substantial amount of concern. Trade has been paused.

It is expected that the next step from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) will be to determine how widely the disease has spread. These detections close to each other suggest that management measures may be inadequate and that the disease situation is not under control.

[Potato wart disease (PW) is caused by the fungus _Synchytrium endobioticum_, which is considered one of the most important pathogens of the crop. It is endemic in Europe and has also been reported from a number of locations in the Americas, Australasia, and Africa. The pathogen can also affect tomato and some solanaceous weeds. On infected potato tubers, "eyes" develop into characteristic warty, cauliflower-like swellings. If infected early, the whole tuber can be replaced by a warty proliferation. Warts darken with age, eventually rot, and disintegrate. Plant vigour is reduced, and both quantity and quality of harvested tubers are severely affected. Diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation, as similar symptoms can be caused by other pathogens. The fungus goes through cycles of proliferation and re-infection as long as cool, wet conditions prevail and is, therefore, less damaging in warm, light, well-drained soils.

The disease is spread with soil (for example on farm tools) by infected seed tubers and also in manure from animals fed on infected potatoes. The fungus can survive in soil for up to 40 years in the absence of a host. Disease management is based on pathogen exclusion by quarantine regulations and the control of local pathogen spread. Use of certified clean seed tubers is crucial; contaminated seed lines pose major risks of losses both in yield and international trade. Fungicides are ineffective, but some experimental fumigation treatments have been shown to kill resting sporangia.

There are several pathotypes defined by their virulence on different host cultivars. Potato varieties resistant to a number of them have been developed, but new pathogen strains are emerging, compromising the efficacy of host plant resistance.

After its first detection on PEI in 2000 (ProMED post 20001028.1877), attempts to confine the pathogen to the site of its initial discovery have unfortunately been unsuccessful. New outbreaks were detected previously also in 2007 and 2014 (ProMED posts 20071102.3559 and 20140901.2738758, respectively).
