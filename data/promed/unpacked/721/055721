Since entering autumn [2015], the normally silent avian influenza has appeared again. Cases have been appearing in Hangzhou and neighboring Shaoxing, Wenzhou, etc. [Zhejiang province]. Hangzhou Center for Disease Control notes that Hangzhou City has already entered the new season for H7N9 avian influenza.

All infected are 45 years of age and above.

This year, the avian influenza outbreak is characterized by distribution over a large, widespread area, cases are mostly [in] rural [areas] over 7 districts and counties (municipalities), divided equally between men and women, all aged 45 and above. [Note: not clear if this is describing all of 2015 or autumn only.] Most patients have high blood pressure, diabetes and other basic conditions. Prior to onset all [patients] have a history of contact with live poultry, especially poultry they are raising.

[According to the World Health Organization, 667 cases and 229 deaths from H7N9 flu have been reported globally from March 2013 through 14 Oct 2015, most from the mainland of China. Cases have been confirmed in the following administrative areas of China: Anhui, Beijing, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Jilin, Shandong, Shanghai, Xinjiang, and Zhejiang. Smaller numbers of cases have been identified in travelers from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Canada (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/avian-flu-h7n9-china).

Since then, new cases have begun to be reported this season in Zhejiang, as posted earlier on ProMED-mail: 4 cases were reported in the post Avian influenza, human (124): China, H7N9 20151109.3779443, and 2 additional cases in the post Avian influenza, human (125): China (ZJ) H7N9, 4th wave H7N9 20151118.3801312. These cases, like the prior cases, appear to be predominantly associated with exposure to poultry.
