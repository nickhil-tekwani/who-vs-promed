A disease known as white nose syndrome has killed approximately one
million little brown bats (_Myotis lucifugus_) in North America, say
scientists. The fungus thrives in the cold, damp caves where bats hibernate.

The research team report in the journal Science that this could drive
the species to extinction in the north eastern US in as little as 16
years. They examined 17 years' worth of data gathered from bat colonies.

A fungus associated with the disease was probably brought by humans
into the caves where bats hibernate.

This _Geomyces destructans_ fungus appears to thrive in the dark,
damp conditions in these caves, where it grows on the bats' noses,
wings, and ears.

Infection makes bats restless during the winter, causing them to stir
when they should be hibernating and to use up their fat reserves.

Once infection takes hold in a hibernating colony it kills, on
average, 73 percent of the animals, the scientists have calculated.

"We went in to some caves and couldn't step on the floor because it
was littered with dead bats," Thomas Kunz from Boston University told BBC News.

Dr Kunz led the team that undertook the study. He explained that the
disease was first discovered in a commercial cave in New York state
in 2006. This cave was frequently visited by tourists, which is why
scientists believe that humans carried the 1st fungal spores into the cave.

"Before white nose, the population was stable, in fact populations
were increasing slightly," said Dr Kunz, "But when we plotted out the
new data... it was pretty clear there was a massive die-off.

"Strictly from this data, we predict that, in 20 years, this regional
population is likely to go extinct, but that's making an assumption
that there will be no recovery period."

The region in question encompasses Pennsylvania, New York state, and
New England, but the disease is quickly spreading beyond that area.

Dr Kunz likened the severity of the disease to the chytrid fungus
that has decimated some amphibian populations, and devil facial
tumour disease, an infectious cancer that is threatening Tasmanian devils.

"This is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of what we're likely to
see in the next several years," he told BBC News. "And we've only
looked here at one [out of the] 6 bat species that have been affected
by the disease." Other affected species include the northern
long-eared bat and the tri-colored bat.

Currently, the fungus has only been detected in Europe and North
America, and it does not appear to cause similar mass die-offs in
European bat populations.

The disease gets its name from the white fungus that grows on the
bats. But in the US, the prospects for the little brown bat are
"pretty dire". The team is currently trying to identify colonies with
a genetic resistance to the disease, to find out it they can use
these animals to help rebuild the population. But that work is in its
early stages.

The scientists are also encouraging people to install bat boxes in
their homes, and have even designed a "roost module" that can be
inserted into the attic of a house.

"People ask, 'why should we care?'," said Dr Kunz. "But we have to
think about how important bats are to ecosystems." A single bat can
eat half its entire bodyweight in insects in one night, and many of
those insects are agricultural pests.

"So those one million bats that have died could have consumed about
694 tonnes of insects in one year."

In the same issue of Science, a team led by Daniel Streicker from the
University of Georgia revealed that bats may also have been unfairly
tarnished with a reputation for infecting humans with rabies.
Although an infected bat could infect a person or other mammal with
rabies by biting them, the virus would be very unlikely to spread in
the human population.

Humans and bats are simply too distantly related, the scientists
found. The likelihood of infection "taking hold" and of ongoing
transmission, even from bat to bat, decreased the more distantly
related the bat species were. The rabies virus, the researchers said,
needed a "closely related host" to be able to jump species.

One of North America's most common bats will go extinct in the
northeastern US within 2 decades if a deadly disease continues to
spread unchecked, scientists warn in a new study. And other bat
species -- including the rare Indiana bat --may soon follow suit.

White nose syndrome, first found in [2006] in a New York cave, is
named for the white, cold-loving fungus that appears on afflicted
bats' noses, wings, and ears.

The condition makes bats restless and disturbs their winter
hibernation. Instead of sleeping peacefully, infected bats burn up
their fat reserves, causing them to die at a staggering rate --
almost 75 percent a year in affected colonies, research shows.

So far the syndrome is known to infect 9 hibernating bat species,
including the widespread and well-studied little brown bat.

Biologist Winifred Frick and colleagues collected bat population data
gathered over the past 3 decades from nearly 2 dozen hibernation
sites in 5 states, and ran the data through population models.

Their analysis showed that little brown bat populations crashed when
white nose syndrome appeared in North America -- perhaps introduced
from Europe or another distant locale.

"We also found that if mortality continues the way we've seen it, the
regional population of this bat ... will basically be gone from the
landscape in 16 to 20 years," said Frick, of Boston University and
the University of California, Santa Cruz.

The syndrome also seems to be spreading quickly into other parts of
the United States, Frick noted.

During 2010 infected bats were found as far south and west as
Tennessee and Oklahoma. The fungus has also spread north to the
Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario.

"This is quickly becoming a continental scale problem," Frick said.
"We're not surprised by this, but we are distressed by it."

And, as the ailment gets a foothold in more places, it's impacting
more bat species.

"We chose little brown [bats] because we had really good data, and
because they were a very common and abundant species," Frick
explained. "But it's reasonable to assume that other hibernating
species will face similar dangers, because the fungus grows in the
hibernation sites. And some of those species, like the Indiana bat,
are already endangered species."

There is no cure for the syndrome, though scientists are searching
for ways to combat the disease.

Though the situation looks bleak for bats, humans also have cause for
concern, Frick said. That's because the flying mammals eat a lot of
insects -- such as mosquitoes -- that damage crops, spread disease,
and generally pester people.

"All the bats affected are insect predators," Frick explained, "and
an individual bat can eat its own body weight in insects each night."

The bat-fungus research will be published in the 6 Aug 2010 issue of
the journal Science.

[White nose syndrome has stymied scientists on finding a cure, a
treatment, a prevention. These are dire predictions. While on the one
hand, encouraging people to put up bat houses is a sound move for the
population, it is a double edged sword, as bats are often the source
of rabies in the USA.

In addition to the suffering of bats caused by this syndrome, which
essentially starves bats to death, this disease is also very
concerning because of its impact on ecosystem health. Bats eat a
tremendous number of insects such as mosquitoes, moths, beetles, and
flies, which help to control insect populations naturally in a
sustainable fashion. However, with the loss of over a million bats in
North America since the disease first surfaced in 2006 and the
prospect of further spread to other states and/or provinces, control
measures such as preventing human traffic in bat caves are being
considered and in some places apparently instituted.

The fungus is often not confined to the muzzle but may spread to the
wings and all over the body. It depletes the bats' body fat and
awakens them so that they get hungry, fly out of their caves looking
for insects and, not finding any, starve to death. See images at:
