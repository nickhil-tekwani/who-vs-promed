The yellow fever mosquito has been found in the City of Tulare by the Tulare Mosquito Abatement District, the Tulare County Health and Human Services Agency reported.

_Aedes aegypti_, also known as the yellow fever mosquito, is capable of transmitting several human diseases, including dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika, stated Tammie Weyker-Adkins, public information officer with the county HHSA. This mosquito is not native to California and is the 1st detection in the City of Tulare. Since 2013 _Aedes aegypti_ has been detected in 13 California counties.

"Our goal is to mitigate the spread of these invasive mosquitoes to other areas of Tulare or the county at large. Having _Aedes aegypti_ in our district is very concerning as it is an efficient vector in spreading Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses," said John Avila, General Manager of the Tulare Mosquito Abatement District.

The Tulare Mosquito Abatement District is working with the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) in addition to the Tulare County Public Health Department to evaluate the extent of the infestation and will aggressively target problem areas to prevent its spread, Weyker-Adkins stated. These efforts will include door-to-door inspections of residential properties for standing water where mosquitoes can breed, increased surveillance through trapping, eliminating mosquito breeding sources, larval control, and ultra low volume fogging as necessary to target the invasive mosquitoes. Fogging will begin immediately in the infestation area.

While these viruses are not currently transmitted in California, they are periodically introduced by international travelers including Mexico. If a large population of _Aedes aegypti_ is established in the area, a single travel associated case of one of these diseases could introduce the virus to local mosquitoes and Tulare County residents could be at risk of becoming infected, Weyker-Adkins stated.

_Aedes aegypti_ is a small (approximately Â¼ inch) black and white day-biting mosquito that prefers to feed on humans. It lives in urban habitats, lays its eggs just above the water surface in small containers such as flower pots, plant saucers, pet bowls, and bird baths.

Please inspect your property and immediately discard any standing water, Weyker-Adkins stated. If you live in an urban residential area and are being bitten by mosquitoes during the day you are encouraged to contact the Tulare Mosquito Abatement District.

Residents can reduce chances of being bitten by _Aedes aegypti_ or other mosquitoes by taking the following precautions:
- Drain standing water; mosquitoes prefer to lay eggs in stagnant water
- Defend yourself against mosquitoes using repellents containing DEET, Picaridin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus.
- Avoid being outdoors when mosquitoes are present, typically dawn and dusk.
- Report neglected swimming pools to the District. Anonymous calls are always accepted.

More information on _Aedes aegypti_ can be found at the California Department of Public Health webpage, <www.cdph.ca.gov>.

[Although this is the 1st report of _Aedes aegypti_ in Tulare city, its discovery there is not surprising. It was discovered earlier in Tulare county. This mosquito has been popping up in various localities in California. It was 1st discovered in the state in the counties of Madera, Fresno, and San Mateo in 2013, before turning up later in Tulare, Kern, Los Angeles, San Diego, Imperial, Orange, and Alameda counties. Both _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ have been detected in southern California in several new locations over the past 1 to 4 years. Fortunately, few individuals have been trapped in these locations, indicating very small populations that are probably too limited to initiate and sustain ongoing Zika, chikungunya, or dengue virus transmission.

Air conditioning and screened windows and doors will help limit their abundance. However, the introduction of these viruses into southern California will continue, so aggressive vector surveillance and control will be important to limit populations of these vectors.
