Everyone is waiting for spring break to start at Fairleigh Dickinson
University's Florham Park campus on Sat 10 Mar 2007. That's because a
norovirus outbreak has sickened nearly 270 students and staff in
recent days. The symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea and usually
subside in several days.
School officials are telling students with new cases to simply go
home early. Those students would take midterm exams later. The
cafeteria, student center, freshman dormitory bathrooms, and
classrooms are being disinfected 3 times a day.
The 24-hour virus hit campus last week, with students falling sick on
Thursday and Friday [1 and 2 Mar 2007, as reported by university
spokesman Art Petro.]

[The source of the norovirus outbreak at Fairleigh Dickinson
University in New Jersey has not been determined, but the apparent
onset of the outbreak within a 2-day period suggests a common source
of exposure. The advice to newly affected students to leave campus
early may be useful for management of the local situation but could
create problems in these students' home communities. - Mod.CP]
[Having just recovered from a probable norovirus infection related to
a school-brought-home outbreak, this moderator definitely agrees with
Mod. CP's above observation. More information on investigations into
a possible common source exposure of this outbreak would be
appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
