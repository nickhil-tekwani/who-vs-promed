Resolutions adopted by the International Committee of the OIE, 3 Jun 2004
<http://oie.int/downld/SG/2004/A_RESO_2004_WP.pdf>
The following resolution XXI, adopted during OIE's 72nd Annual General
Session (Paris, 23 - 28 May 2004), is forwarded in line with commentary in
ProMED-mail posting 20040529.1469.
Resolution No. XXI: Recognition of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy
status of member countries:
Considering that
1. During the 69th General Session, the International Committee adopted
Resolution No. XV, Recognition of the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy
Status of Member Countries,
<ftp://ftp.oie.int/69SG_2001/a_reso_2001.pdf>,
asking Member Countries that wish to be evaluated for conformation with
the requirements of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code (the
Terrestrial Code) for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) free status to
submit a formal application to the Director General of the OIE for
consideration by the Scientific Commission for Animal Disease (Scientific
Commission),
2. An Ad hoc Group of experts on BSE has been set up by the OIE, and the
Group has developed guidelines to facilitate the submission of data by
Member Countries in accordance with the requirements in the current edition
of the Terrestrial Code,
3. During the 70th General Session, the International Committee adopted
Resolution XVIII
<ftp://ftp.oie.int/70SG_2002/a_reso_2002.pdf>
asking Member Countries applying for this evaluation to meet part of the
costs sustained by the OIE Central Bureau in the evaluation process,
4. During the 71st General Session, the International Committee adopted
Resolution XXII, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy,
<ftp://ftp.oie.int/A_Reso_2003%20WP.pdf>
authorizing the Scientific Commission to also evaluate submissions for
provisional freedom from BSE in accordance with Article 2.3.13.4 of the
Terrestrial Code,
5. The Ad hoc Group has already examined submissions from several countries
and made appropriate recommendations that have been endorsed by the
Scientific Commission,
6. These recommendations have been submitted to Member Countries for
comments as outlined in Resolution No. XVI, which was adopted during the
67th General Session of the International Committee for foot and mouth
disease (FMD),
7. Information published by the OIE is derived from appropriate
declarations made by the official Veterinary Services of Member Countries.
The OIE is not responsible for inaccurate publication of country disease
status based on inaccurate information, or changes in epidemiological
status, or other significant events that were not promptly reported to the
Central Bureau.
The committee resolves that
1. The Director General establish a list of countries or zones recognized
by the OIE as "BSE free" and "provisionally free" in accordance with
Chapter 2.3.13 of the Terrestrial Code. This list should be updated as, and
when, new countries are approved by the International Committee and shall
be adopted annually by resolution.
2. The Director General publish that Argentina, Iceland, Singapore and
Uruguay be recognized as "provisionally free" from BSE in accordance with
the provisions of Article 2.3.13.4 of the Terrestrial Code.
3. The Director General inform Delegates of Member Countries -- whose
countries, or zones within their national territories, are recognized as
"free" or "provisionally free" from BSE -- that they should annually
confirm, by letter, each November, both their status, and, that the
criteria by which their status was recognized remains unchanged. The list
of countries, or zones, will be published free of charge by the OIE.

[Chapter 2.3.13 "Bovine spongiform encephalitis" in OIE's Terrestrial
Animal Health Code has been updated during the 72nd General Session. The
following subchapters describe the conditions upon which OIE member
countries may be officially classified in one of the 5 categories:
1. BSE free country or zone
2. BSE provisionally free country or zone
3. Country or zone with a minimal BSE risk
4. Country or zone with a moderate BSE risk
5. Country or zone with a high BSE risk
At present, no country has been officially classified by the OIE as "free."
4 countries have been classified as "BSE provisionally free."

permanently identified, and their movements controlled, and
when slaughtered, or at death, are completely destroyed; and either:
