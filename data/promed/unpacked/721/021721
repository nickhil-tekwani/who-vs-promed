Case of Rift Valley Fever Detected in Jeddah
--------------------------------------------
JEDDAH: The first case of Rift Valley fever has been detected in Jeddah,
according to a report in the Al-Madinah Arabic daily yesterday. The Health
Department referred the case to the King Saud Hospital after preliminary
tests had confirmed the diagnosis.
The patient came from the Al-Khamrah district in southern Jeddah. The area
is notorious for environmental pollution and stagnant waters which provide a
breeding ground for mosquitoes.
