An Ottawa County cheesemaker is voluntarily recalling 20 000 pounds of organic cheese after 7 people reported becoming ill.

Grassfields Cheese LLC of Coopersville issued the nationwide recall Wed 3 Aug 2016. The company said the cheese may be contaminated with _E. coli_, a bacterium that can cause cramps, diarrhea and vomiting. The company said that between March and July 2016, 7 people were sickened by the same strain of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_. A sample of Grassfields cheese tested positive for the bacterium, according to a state lab.

While most _E. coli_ infections are mild, about 5-10 percent of patients infected with these enterohemorrhagic (Shiga toxin-producing) bacteria develop a potentially life-threatening complication that can shut down their kidneys, according to the CDC.

The recall involves all types and sizes of organic cheeses manufactured between 1 Dec 2015 and 1 Jun 2016, including:
Gouda
Onion 'n Garlic
Country Dill
Leyden
Edam
Lamont Cheddar
Chili Cheese
Fait Fras
Polkton Corners
Crofters

The recalled cheeses were sold online and from Grassfields Cheese's Coopersville store.

[As can be seen in the list of previous postings below, EHEC infections can be spread through cheese vehicles. Overall, the common co-factor is the lack of proper pasteurization of milk used to produce the cheese.

No details have been released regarding what and/or where the process was defective. The serotype of the organism is not stated. - Mod.LL
