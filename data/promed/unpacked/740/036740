[The following communication from Tom Pringle has been edited to remove the
more emotive remarks. But, overall, it presents an hypothesis for the
apparent non-random distribution of this disease in Colorado and surrounding
areas. - MHJ
Here are the highlights from two CWD papers that I recently obtained, the
oldest (1980) and the newest (1997). The oldest does not contain any
relevent cites to earlier reports on the disease.
http://www.mad-cow.org/colorado_exp.html#drainages shows where animals have
been found.
CWD was first seen at an unnamed wildlife facility in Ft. Collins in 1967,
though unfortunately "morbidity and mortality from CWD have not been
accurately recorded among mule deer in these facilities during the period
1967-74". It may be the Wild Animal Disease Center though that could also be
the name of the Wheatland, Wyoming facility as Tom Thorne was evidently a
staff member in 1980.
There is no discussion of the Wyoming facility or history of its
experimental animals. The owner/operators are not identified for either
facility. I don't know whether these facilities still operative, whether
they are still experiencing CWD 30 years later, or whether they are still
releasing infected animals back out into the wild or shipping them to game
farms, zoos or other facilities. Williams and Young wrote in 1992 that CWD
"should be viewed with concern in the light of international movements of
wild ruminants and the current expansion of the game farming and ranching
industry in many parts of the world."
The Colorado facility was evidently contaminated over at least a 12 year
period, with 54/67 deer affected, at ages 2.5-4, during 1974-79.
[and "The majority (approximately 90%) of mule deer were hand raised from
infancy after they received colostrum and were separated from does at 1-5
days of age. Most were born to does trapped in the wild during pregnancy,
brought to the facility, and released (back to the wild) after parturition.
The remainder were either born to resident does bred in captivity or orphan
fawns captured in the wild ... From time to time a few young adult deer
trapped in the wild have been added to the permanent captive populations."
"Fawns were bottle fed cow's milk supplemented with vitamins and weaned at
70-80 days. Thereafter, groups of 2-10 deer occupied pens aprrocimately 0.1
to 1.0 hectares in size and recived rations of alfalfa hay, commercially
mixed grains supplemented with minerals and vitamins, and fresh water. Over
the years a variety of grain mixes have been used...."
"Within the facilities, deer have had irregular and discontinuous contact
with other wild ruminants (elk, white-tailed deer, proghorns, bighorns, and
mouflon, Ovis musimon) and domestic cattle, goats, and sheep. (Mice, rabbit,
raccoon, skunk, ground squirrels, dogs and cats also reside within or
traverse the facility.)"
Comments:
1. These data strongly support efficient horizontal transmission within the
facility. It is improbable, 10 years prior to the disease being seen in the
wild, that 80% of the wild does carried the disease _and_ transmitted it
vertically to fawns. Close confinement favors lateral spread. The disease
had passed to three species by 1982 within the facility.
The facility made four horrible mistakes in confining sheep (and their
diseases) with wild ungulates, in letting 13 years go by without studying or
recording dying animals, in releasing post-partem does back to the wild from
a facility contaminated with an infectious disease, and possibly
trans-shipping pre-symptomatic animals to other facilities worldwide. Have
the facilities been shut down and isolated or are they still operating?
2. The origin of CWD is unclear. Feed within the facility, if accurately
described, could not account for origin. A sick wild animal might have been
brought in and amplified the disease along under conditions of close
contact. This animal may have had access to downer cow protein supplement or
scrapie sheep pastures or been a sporadic case.
Spraker et al. write, "it is possible that feeding of deer and elk by local
residents in Estes Park and other developments may be a contributing factor.
If this disease is transmitted horizontally, either by direct contact or
environmental contamination, then artificial feeding stations for wild
cervids could be exacerbating the problem at a local level." Rations at the
feeding stations are not described. [As winter feeding of wild deer is
usually 'cracked corn',ie poor quality maize, it is probably of very
doubtful risk. MHJ
The first wild ungulates with CWD was seen in 1981, a year after the disease
was first described as a spongiform encephalopathy and 14 years into the
disease in the facility. Their pathology was identical to that of the
original confined animals. Numbers detected remained low until quite
recently: 49 in Colorado, 11 in Wyoming, to 1995; however monitoring has
intensified recently. Symptoms are not particularly striking: depression,
weight loss, excessive salivation, dull hair coat, fear of humans, drooping
ears, etc.
Alternately, the disease could simply be scrapie passed from sheep (goats
and cattle much less likely). The sheep in the captive facility not
adequately described in terms of numbers, contact, disposition, and scrapie
history. Wild does brought in to fawn could have become infected at the
facility prior to release to the wild, introducing it there.
It is likely that the facilities exacerbated the disease in the wild by
releasing newly infected does year after year.
