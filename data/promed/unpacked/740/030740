In Berlin, Fabian Leendertz did the DNA isolation and Real-Time PCR on the
2 Plasmids (PX01 and PXO2) and the rpoB gene.The blood and spleen are
clearly positive for _B. anthracis_ in all 3 regions.
We shall now go back to QENP [Queen Elizabeth National Park] to collect
samples from hippo carcasses from various sites to map the contaminated area.

[I must admit to some puzzlement that it has proven so difficult to
diagnose at least some of these deaths if anthrax was one cause -- if not
the only cause. There have been anthrax epidemics in the QENP in the recent
past but in game animals. The last big hippo die-off from anthrax was in
eastern Zambia about 7 years ago. Obviously they can die from many causes,
and I look forward to seeing what comes of the ongoing investigations.
Thanks to Risto for keeping us updated on this investigation. - Mod.MHJ]
