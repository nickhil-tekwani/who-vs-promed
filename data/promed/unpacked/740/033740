Additional pathology tests have ruled out 2 deadly fish viruses --
viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) and channel catfish virus [CCV] --
as causes of a die-off that killed thousands of catfish in early
September [2007] along the Red River south of Grand Forks.

Instead, the tests confirm the initial diagnosis that 2 bacterial
infections, _Columnaris_ and _Aeromonas_, caused the catfish to die.

According to Ling Shen, fish health specialist for the Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources (DNR) in St. Paul, a nearly dead
catfish sent to the DNR's pathology lab in early September [2007]
tested positive for both bacteria, which occur naturally in the water.

Meanwhile, 2 other fish caught by Grand Forks anglers and collected
by DNR staff for testing a few weeks later showed skin lesions, Shen
said, but were in better condition than the 1st catfish tested.
Neither of the fish had _Columnaris_ bacteria on their gills, she
said, and none of the internal organs tested positive for the
_Aeromonas_ bacteria.

It's likely a combination of environmental factors, including high
water temperatures and low river flows in the weeks leading up to the
die-off, weakened the immune systems of the catfish, making them more
susceptible to infection.

Shen says cooler water and higher flows likely have reduced stress on
the catfish and improved their immune systems. As recently as this
past weekend [20-21 Oct 2007], though, anglers fishing the Red
reported seeing catfish with scars and bleeding lesions.

"The scars we are seeing may be coming from the initial infection,
and they're just in the healing process," Shen said.

Meanwhile, fisheries officials from the DNR and North Dakota Game and
Fish Department said they were encouraged that deadly fish viruses
didn't cause the die-off. Channel catfish virus normally occurs in
hatchery situations, while VHS can cause a wide variety of
sought-after fish to bleed to death.

Viral tests take longer to complete, and results just became
available Thursday [25 Oct 2007]. "It's good to rule that [VHS and
CCV] out," said Henry Drewes, regional fisheries supervisor for the
DNR in Bemidji. "We did not expect (the viruses), but it is
reassuring to get that confirmation."

The next step, officials say, is to try and learn more about what
environmental factors caused the catfish to be more susceptible to
the bacterial infections.

"They're natural bugs that are in the water," Drewes said. "The fact
they expressed themselves to the degree it caused some high mortality
is cause for concern."

The key, Drewes said, is sound watershed management and working to
maintain stable river flows.

Scott Gangl, fisheries management coordinator for Game and Fish in
Bismarck, said officials in both states will be looking at available
data to learn more about the river conditions that caused the die-off
to occur. Besides DNR and Game and Fish, the North Dakota Health
Department and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency handle water
issues on the Red, Gangl said.

"It's going to take a little work to sort it out, put the whole
puzzle together," he said. "If we can identify a source of a
potential stressor that we can do something about, we'll take every
action we can to do something. Rest assured, we will take this as
seriously as possible and if we can identify something, we will, and
if there are actions we can take, we'll take those actions. "It's not
something we're sweeping under the rug."

Additional fisheries assessments to gauge the impact on catfish
populations in the affected area also are possible, he said. Red
River fish populations are sampled every 5 years, most recently a DNR
survey in 2005, but there might have to be some follow-up testing
next year [2008], Gangl said.

On the plus side, the removal of lowhead dams that impede fish
passage will help catfish and other species redistribute and minimize
the impact of the die-off, the DNR's Drewes said.

"One of the beauties of the dam removal is the deck gets reshuffled
every year," Drewes said. "Those fish are free to move up and down the Red.

"It's certainly not gloom and doom for that fishery by any means.
It's certainly an unfortunate set of circumstances, but I look for
fishing to bounce right back."

[_Aeromonas_ is a genus of bacteria that is ubiquitous in the
environment. It is present in all types of water worldwide as well as
food and soil. There are approximately 16 different species in this
genus, the best known of which is _Aeromonas hydrophila_.
Physiologically, _Aeromonas_ are similar to bacteria in the coliform
group and can be isolated from similar environments.

Usually, when fish get sick with an _Aeromonas_ infection, something
has happened to make them susceptible to bacterial invasion.

There is no single physical or behavioral sign specific for
_Aeromonas_ infections. Infected fish frequently have small pinpoint
hemorrhages at the base of the fins or on the skin, distended
abdomens, and protruding eyes. Internal signs include fluid in the
abdomen, swollen liver and spleen, and the intestines are distended
and fluid-filled.

Motile aeromonas septicemia (MAS) is a common bacterial disease,
caused by _Aeromonas_, which affects warm water fish, both in
commercial production systems and in natural waters. Frequently, MAS
outbreaks are stress-related and elimination of the underlying stress
factor may be sufficient to resolve the disease outbreak.

Columnaris, 1st described by Herbert Spencer Davis in 1922, is one of
the oldest known diseases of warm water fish. References to the
disease can be confusing. The causative bacterium has been referred
to by different names including _Bacillus columnaris_, _Flexibacter
columnaris_, _Cytophaga columnaris_, and most recently
_Flavobacterium columnare_.

Fish with columnaris usually have brown to yellowish-brown lesions
(sores) on their gills, skin, and/or fins. The bacteria attach to the
gill surface, grow in spreading patches, and eventually cover
individual gill filaments

Skin lesions produced by columnaris initially are very shallow and
may appear as an area that has lost its natural shiny appearance.

_Columnaris_ bacteria probably occur in most, if not all, aquaculture
environments. The bacteria can cause disease under normal culture
conditions, but more likely when fish are stressed. Stressful
conditions favoring columnaris disease include low oxygen, high
ammonia, high nitrite, and high water temperatures.

Generally with these 2 bacterial agents one may surmise that the
water is more warm than usual for this time of year, as has been the
ambient temperature. It has also been drier in that region than
normally expected, which may also influence water quality.
