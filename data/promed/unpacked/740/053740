Medical personnel at a hospital in Kyushu, Japan have reported what may be
Japan's first documented death due to infection with vancomycin-resistant
_Enterococcus_ species (VRE). A 60 year-old male developed peritonitis
following abdominal surgery, and died last March despite vancomycin therapy.
Infection control surveys of stool cultures from hospital personnel and
patients revealed only one other VRE isolate. The second, derived from
another patient, was distinguishable from the first by chromosome analysis.

[To date, there are limited data available for the prevalence of VRE
strains in Japan. A 1997 survey in a Nagasaki hospital yielded data
suggesting a low frequency of isolates (Epidemiol. Infect.
119(2):175-181,1997). ProMED-mail would appreciate additional information
on VRE isolates in Japan. - Mod.ES
