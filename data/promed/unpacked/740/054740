One hundred students and teachers at a kindergarten in Ansan, just south of Seoul, have complained of food poisoning symptoms over the past week, with about one 3rd of them hospitalized for hamburger disease and other disorders, municipal health officials said [Thu 25 Jun 2020].

According to the officials in Ansan, about 50 km [approx 31 mi] south of the capital, 100 out of 184 pupils and 18 teachers from the unidentified kindergarten have shown symptoms of food poisoning since [16 Jun 2020] and 31 of them have been sent to hospitals so far. Most of the hospitalized patients are students.

They said 14 of the patients are showing signs of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), also known as hamburger disease, which can cause severe kidney failure, noting 5 of them with poor kidney function are undergoing dialysis therapy. The remaining 17 patients are suffering from diarrhea, stomach ache and fever symptoms, without exhibiting signs of HUS, they added. The number of patients has been increasing since 4 children complained of stomach ache on [16 Jun 2020]. By the next day [17 Jun 2020], 10 pupils exhibited symptoms of stomach ache and diarrhea.

Authorities have collected samples from all 202 students and teachers for clinical analysis, while conducting separate examinations into 84 related people, including 58 family members and 3 food supplier employees. Authorities have so far found enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ bacteria in samples taken from about 42 pupils and 1 teacher. HUS is one of the complications caused by enterohemorrhagic strains of _E. coli_ bacteria. They said 147 people have tested negative for the bacteria, with 96 others waiting for test results.

The authorities are now conducting further epidemiological research, suspecting the mass food poisoning may have been caused by lunch provided by the kindergarten. The kindergarten has been ordered to close until the end of this month. They also fined the kindergarten for failing to preserve some of its food ingredients offered to students in case of a food poisoning outbreak.

Meanwhile, the municipality of Ansan said another kindergarten in the city, about 10 km [approx. 0.6 mi] away from the 1st one, has also reported a food poisoning outbreak, which has so far affected 8 students and 1 teacher. Since Monday [22 Jun 2020], the number of students and teachers with food poisoning symptoms has been steadily growing from the 2nd kindergarten, where 167 pupils are enrolled, it said.

Lee Jae-jeong, the superintendent of Gyeonggi Province Office of Education, apologized and vowed a thorough investigation and measures to prevent such incidents. "We will support every possible measure for children to receive treatment and recover from the disease," Lee said. "I feel very sorry to the children and their parents."

[Hemolytic uremic syndrome is sometimes called hamburger disease related to the first recording outbreak of hemolytic uremic syndrome linked to, at the time, a rare serotype of _E. coli_ (O157:H7) associated with undercooked hamburgers from a chain restaurant; although these organisms, which O157:H7 is the prototype, can be acquired from other foods or environments from contamination with (usually) bovine faeces.

The specific serotype in these cases is, as yet, not stated.

Most cases of HUS associated with these organisms occur in children and usually in less than 10% of total cases. The number of HUS cases seems a bit higher here but we need to wait until all the statistics are reported. The use of antimicrobials early in the course can increase the risk of HUS.

It is not clear if the smaller, 2nd cluster of cases is related to the same cause. - Mod.LL
