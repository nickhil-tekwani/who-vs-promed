Bovine tuberculosis was found in a 2-year-old steer [from] the state's thumb region, according to state officials.

United States Department of Agriculture's food safety inspection service identified the Huron County steer as possibly diseased during inspection [presumably of the carcass] and removed the animal from the human food chain, according to a statement from Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development. After the steer was removed, it tested positive for bovine TB, the statement said.

State agriculture officials identified the farm in Huron County that sent the steer to slaughter, along with 2 prior farms in Presque Isle County where the animal had been kept. Each farm will be tested to ensure the disease is not present, the statement said. A 3-mi [approx 4.8 km] surveillance area around the Huron County farm has been established and all farms within that zone will have 6 months to complete bovine tuberculosis testing.

There will be a meeting to discuss the finding of bovine TB and the surveillance area at 7 pm, on 14 Nov [2016] at the Holiday Inn Express & Suites, 55 Rapson Lane West in Bad Axe.

"Cattle properly identified with (radio frequency identification) can be traced in minutes," Dr. Rick Smith, assistant state veterinarian said in a statement. "Not only can we find the most recent owner, we can successfully track where the animal has moved, allowing us to stamp out disease before it spreads."

The name of the farm that the steer came from and city it was located in was not released under Public Act 466 that bars making that information public, according to Jennifer Holton, spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development. "This did not go into the food chain," Holton said of the steer. "This shows that what is supposed to be happening did happen to make sure that consumer public health, food safety is protected."

Bovine TB primarily affects cattle, but can be spread between other mammals, including humans. The [bacterial pathogen] primarily affects the respiratory system of infected animals, but can spread to other parts of the body. In the U.S., [infection of] humans with bovine TB from animals is rare, according to state officials, and bovine TB can be effectively treated in exposed humans.

[According to the Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development website of 31 Oct 2016: "Bovine tuberculosis was recently confirmed in samples taken from a 2-year old steer from Huron County. The animal was identified as possibly diseased and removed from the human food chain by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety Inspection Service, who inspects each animal during processing." i.e., at post-mortem inspection of the carcass http://www.michigan.gov/mdard/0,4610,7-125-1660-396745--,00.html.
