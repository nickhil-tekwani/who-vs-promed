The National Commission for Surveillance and Control of the Toxic Red Tide in Guatemala, declared a red tide alert because the constant monitoring and analysis carried out showed high concentrations of saxitoxins above the appropriate limits.

The presence of toxic red tide was detected on the Pacific Coast, on the coast of Tiquisate, Escuintla, indicated Virginia Herzing de Stwolinsky, head of the Risk Management Unit of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MSPAS).

For this reason, bivalve mollusks, such as mussels, clams, and shells must not be consumed. The consumption of the aforementioned foods produces severe intoxication and could even cause death.

On 29 Apr 2022, 3 cases of paralytic shellfish poisoning were reported in 2 minors and 1 adult, who were treated at the hospital in the southern municipality of Tiquisate, department of Escuintla, with gastrointestinal symptoms due to the consumption of clams.

To date, 11 cases with the same symptoms have been reported, and one of them died.

The MSPAS ordered to strengthen epidemiological surveillance actions to identify and notify possible cases of intoxication which may be registered on the Pacific coast due to the presence of red tide.

Also, monitor the elevation of saxitoxin levels and alert all public and private health services so the personnel may take into consideration the clinical diagnosis of the disease.

The National Laboratory has carried out tests and has detected saxitoxin in clams, with levels of 7069.4 RU/100g in samples obtained in the municipality of Tiquisate; the level considered non-toxic is less than 400 UR/100g.

The symptoms of intoxication are tingling in the lips, tongue, mouth, and face; then it stretches and muscle strength is lost; paralysis, respiratory distress, nausea, dizziness, and vomiting; these signs may appear 30 to 60 minutes after consuming the aforementioned mollusks.

If the symptoms mentioned above occur, you should go immediately to the service nearest health center to receive the appropriate treatment. All the services are free.

[Airborne toxins, water spray, and splashes in an outbreak have kept people from beaches while leaving others with irritated eyes and throats. Red tide irritates the skin of people exposed to it and can cause itchy eyes, scratchy throats, and coughs. Harvesting shellfish from affected areas for personal consumption is discouraged. Red tide poisoning symptoms include nausea and dizziness and may last for several days.

Shellfish that have caused this disease include mussels, cockles, clams, scallops, oysters, crabs, and lobsters. Symptoms begin anywhere from 15 minutes to 10 hours after eating the contaminated shellfish, although usually within 2 hours. Symptoms are generally mild and begin with numbness or tingling of the face, arms, and legs. This is followed by headache, dizziness, nausea, and muscular incoordination. Patients sometimes describe a floating sensation. In cases of severe poisoning, muscle paralysis and respiratory failure occur, and in these cases, death may occur in 2 to 25 hours.

Contamination with Saxitoxin is a serious situation. Hopefully individuals will heed the warning. Do not eat the marine life at this time, and don't go swimming in these waters. Painful eye conditions, sinus conditions, and other systemic issues may occur. The illness can be quite serious.

"Saxitoxins are also known as paralytic shellfish poisons (PSPs). Most human saxitoxin toxicoses have been associated with the ingestion of marine shellfish, which accumulate saxitoxins produced by marine dinoflagellates. However, saxitoxins are also found in freshwaters, produced by cyanobacteria in the genera _Anabaena_, _Aphanizomenon_, _Planktothrix_, _Cylindrospermopsis_, _Lyngbya_, and _Scytonema_."

"Saxitoxins are best known for their effects on people after ingestion of contaminated marine shellfish. The syndrome is termed paralytic shellfish poisoning. The name of the toxin was based on the genus of the Alaskan butter clam, _Saxidomus_, from which the prototype member of the group was first isolated after a large number of people who had eaten the clams experienced the toxic syndrome. After ocean waters become free of the toxigenic dinoflagellates, mussels rapidly eliminate the toxins, but other organisms do so at widely varying rates.

"Saxitoxin is now known to be one of many structurally and toxicologically similar toxins, including neosaxitoxin, and other derivatives, many of which are termed gonyautoxins. Marine dinoflagellates in the genera _Alexandrium_ (formerly _Gonyaulax_), _Gymnodinium_, and _Pyrodinium_ are producers of these toxins. Saxitoxins and related compounds accumulate in a range of planktivorous invertebrates, including mollusks (bivalves and gastropods), crustaceans, and echinoderms, and fishes that ingest the toxigenic dinoflagellates. Predatory fish, birds, marine mammals, and humans can be poisoned through the food web when they ingest contaminated shellfish or finfish. Saxitoxins are monitored in shellfish and other seafood species, and closures of fisheries are commonly implemented to prevent harvest of contaminated organisms."

"The clinical presentation of saxitoxin-poisoning varies depending on the level of exposure. The lag time between exposure and the appearance of clinical signs is highly variable, and can range from minutes to as long as 72 hours (Montebruno, 1993). At relatively low exposure levels, moderate paresthesias, often described as a tingling sensation, are experienced around the mouth and extremities. Larger exposures lead to a spreading numbness of the mouth, throat, and extremities. High exposure levels may cause acute muscle paralysis and respiratory failure."
