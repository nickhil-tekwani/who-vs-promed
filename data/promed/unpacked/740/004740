[At least 9 people have died from H7N9 avian influenza virus infection since the start of this year 2016, according to disease control centers in Henan, Guangdong, and Hunan provinces.]

Chinese disease control experts said that the public should stay on alert for H7N9 avian flu, which has caused a least 9 deaths this year [2017]. H7N9 has entered its peak season and direct contact with live poultry remains the main source of infection, said a statement by Zhejiang provincial disease control and prevention center [Tue 31 Dec 2017].

Genetic analysis showed that there had been no mutations of the virus, but since late autumn last year [2016], the epidemic had been reported in a wide range of areas, it said. The virus was more active in 2016 than in the same season in previous years. A total of 44 cases were reported last year [2016] in Zhejiang, causing 2 deaths. H7N9 is a strain [of avian influenza] first reported to have infected humans in March 2013, in China. It is most likely to strike in winter and spring.
