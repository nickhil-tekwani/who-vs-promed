Francistown probes 2 suspected polio cases
-----------------------------------------------
Doctors at Nyangabgwe Referral Hospital have confirmed that the hospital is
investigating 2 possible cases of polio infection. On Wed 19 May, Mmegi
learned that the 2 cases (2 children aged 3 and 11 years) from Borolong, in
the Tutume Sub-district, were showing signs of polio.

The 2 cases were reported on Mon 17 May and Tue 18 May. The hospital
superintendent, Dr. Loeto Mazhani, said that the 2 children were in
paralysis when they were brought in.

Botswana's 13-year polio free-status was broken early in 2004 when a child
in Ngami was found infected with the poliovirus.

The government had launched a 2-phase anti-polio drive to deal with the
situation before the suspected cases from Tutume.

"We are investigating the 2 cases with a view to establishing whether these
are indeed polio cases or something else. We have been doing this even
before the emergency polio campaign, and this is not new," Mazhani said.

He indicated that every case of paralysis is investigated thoroughly to
establish if it is polio-related.

"Once a case is reported, we work very hard with a view to excluding polio.
This has been common even in the past," he explained and added that it is
possible that the 2 cases are not polio.

He indicated that there are many illnesses which could present themselves
through paralysis. He revealed that, previously, they investigated
suspected cases of polio which turned out to be negative. He stressed that
there is nothing new about the 2 cases.

He said that they were going to take samples of stools from the suspected
cases for further investigation in South Africa, adding, that only after
investigations are complete would health authorities determine the next
course of action.

A health expert in the Francistown City Council, Dr. Harry Thuku, informed
Mmegi that Botswana does not have laboratories to make the necessary polio
investigations. Under the circumstances, it will be about a month before
the results are known.

He also warned that polio is contagious. Medical journals show that the
poliovirus attacks the nervous system and can sometimes cause permanent
muscle paralysis. If contracted in chest muscles, it can be fatal. The
poliovirus is passed through human feces, and although immunization means
it is no longer a problem, some countries are still fighting to eradicate
it. The poliovirus is reported to be endemic in 6 countries: Nigeria,
India, Pakistan, Niger, Afghanistan, and Egypt.

[The location of the 1st case of polio in Botswana was in Ngami in the
northwest of the country (see Poliomyelitis - Botswana ex Nigeria
20040415.1026). These current suspected cases are situated in Tutume, in
the northeast of the country.
An important part of polio surveillance, for the eradication effort, has
been the reporting of cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) for further
investigation to see if poliovirus is the etiology of the AFP illness. As
there are other disease processes that can produce AFP (such as
Guillan-Barre Syndrome - GBS), rates of non-polio associated AFP reporting
are used to monitor a country's surveillance activities. A reported rate of
AFP greater than 1.0 per 100 000 population is considered to be indicative
of adequate surveillance activities. According to the Global Polio
Eradication Initiative website statistics,
<http://www.who.int/vaccines/casecount/afpextractnew.cfm> Botswana had a
non-polio AFP reporting rate of 2.3 per 100 000 population in 2003, with 16
cases of AFP reported, and, 75 percent with adequate stool specimens
submitted for viral isolation studies, of which none were positive. To
date, in 2004, Botswana has reported 6 AFP cases, out of which, one had a
type-1 poliovirus identified. Genetic studies on the virus isolated
revealed it to be consistent with a type-1 poliovirus strain currently
circulating in Nigeria. The occurrence of 2 additional suspected cases of
polio in Botswana, following this 1st case, are cause for concern, but they
may just be part of the observed background non-polio AFP illness that
occurs in Botswana. We await more information on the results of laboratory
testing of these current AFP cases in Botswana.
There is a very interesting mapping of wild poliovirus isolates for 2004 on
the Polio Eradication website:
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/fixed/casemap.shtml>.
We await further information on these currently reported suspected cases in
Botswana. - Mod.MPP]
