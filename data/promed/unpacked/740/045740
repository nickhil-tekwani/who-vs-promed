[HPAI H5N6 has been circulating in Viet Nam since 2014. From January to December 2019, 9 outbreaks of HPAI H5N6 were reported. For additional details on the outbreaks, see Viet Nam's OIE 6-monthly report Jan to Jun 2019 at https://tinyurl.com/v5llnds, and OIE 6-monthly report Jul to Dec 2019 at https://tinyurl.com/ybp96v2c , section 3 of these reports.

"Avian Influenza outbreaks can lead to devastating consequences for the poultry industry as well as at national level. Experience has shown that:
- Farmers might experience a high level of mortality in their flocks, with rates often around 50%;
- Due to the labor intensive nature of the poultry industry, especially in developing countries, job losses can be significant;
- To contain outbreaks, healthy birds often need to be culled, resulting in risks to animal and human welfare, and concerns regarding protein wastage and economic impacts;
- The presence of HPAI restricts international trade in live birds and poultry meat;
- Public opinion may be damaged, reducing both travel and tourism in affected areas.

People who are in close contact with infected birds are at risk for acquiring avian influenza. While many human cases are limited to conjunctivitis or mild respiratory disease, some viruses tend to cause severe illness. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the consumption of poultry or eggs fit for human consumption could transmit the AI virus to humans.

As a precautionary and regulatory measure, animals that have been culled as a result of measures to control an AI outbreak should not be allowed to enter the human food and animal feed chain, and precautionary measures for the cleaning and cooking process should be respected".
