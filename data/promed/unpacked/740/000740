Heavy rains sow desolation in Niger
--------------------------------------------
It has been raining heavily for more than a month in Niger, causing more
than 15 deaths, and damage to roads, houses and the harvest, in this
country which is normally drought-stricken, leading to famine during the
last 3 years.
They are the heaviest rains since 1921, and 3 times last years.
In Niamey, 20,000 people are homeless. All sections of the city lack
drinking water, according to the National Water Company, and since
community wells are inaccessible, people are drinking from the gutters,
exposing themselves to cholera.
Malaria is on the rampage, according to health authorities.
The crops in the north are also being damaged by insects, and those in the
south and east by seed-eating birds and 'crickets.'
