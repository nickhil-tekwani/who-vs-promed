99/118 First find of _Colletotrichum acutatum_ in Slovenia
------------------------------------------
The NPPO of Slovenia has recently informed the EPPO Secretariat that
_Colletotrichum acutatum_ (EU Annex II/A2) has been found for the first time
in 1998. First symptoms were observed in a strawberry field near Krsko
(Fragaria ananassa cvs Elsanta, Miss, Marmolada). The fungus was isolated on
potato dextrose agar (PDA) and identified by cultural and morphological
characters by the Agricultural Institute of Slovenia in autumn 1998.
Identification was confirmed by ELISA at the Central Science laboratory, UK.
In order to prevent any further spread of the disease, the NPPO of Slovenia
has initiated a survey on strawberry plants in the field and on imported
plants for planting.

[Strawberry anthracnose caused by _C.acutatum_ is considered an emerging
disease in the USA, and it appears to be an emerging disease in Slovenia.
The pathogen is very aggressive, and the disease is difficult [to eradicate]
once it is established in a planting. A pest alert for the disease was
issued in North Carolina in 1999. Does anyone have information on the
distribution of the disease in Europe? This report is recommended because it
is the first record of the disease in Slovenia, and hence of general
interest to pathologists. - Mod. DH]
