Foot-and-mouth disease virus (inf. with), Palestine
---------------------------------------------------
General information
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 13 Dec 2021
Confirmed: 19 Dec 2021
Reported: 23 Dec 2021
Reason for notification: recurrence
Last occurrence: 18 Jun 2019
Causal agent: foot-and-mouth disease virus
Serotype: O
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to a determined zone of the country.

Outbreak location: East Jabalia, Gaza ash Shamaliyah, Gaza
Date of start of the outbreak: 13 Dec 2021
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cattle / 250 / 250 / - / - / - / -
Affected population: Unvaccinated imported beef cattle (2 months ago) and this flock didn't take the booster dose during quarantine period.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: The flock didn't take the booster dose during the quarantine period, and due to shortage in vaccine supply, the suspected population (sheep, goat, cattle) in Gaza Strip didn't get vaccinated against FMD since the last year. There are a lot of cattle farms near the outbreak; an investigation has been triggered in the area of 3 km [1.9 mi] around the farm. Any new information or outbreaks will be submitted in the follow up reports.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: traceability, screening, movement control inside the country, quarantine
Domestic control measures to be applied: vaccination in response to the outbreak(s)

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Veterinary Services Laboratory in Gaza (National Laboratory)
Species / Outbreaks / Test / Tested from / Result
Cattle / 1 / Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 19 Dec 2021 / positive

[Jabalia, in the northern governorate of the Gaza district, Palestinian Authority (PA), is a city located 4 km [2.5 mi] north of Gaza City; map at <tinyurl.com/d4aje6ud>.

The territory of the PA includes 2 primary subdivisions: the districts West Bank and Gaza, two discontiguous blocks of land, each subdivided into governorates. Gaza is a narrow strip along the Mediterranean Sea; West Bank lies immediately to the west of the Jordan River which separates it from the Kingdom of Jordan. Both districts are administered, on the animal health level, by a Chief Veterinary Officer stationed in the West Bank, by whom the notifications of OIE-listed diseases are submitted to the OIE HQ in Paris.

On 13 Dec 2021, the CVO submitted an immediate notification of an FMD outbreak in Al-Hadidiya, Tubas governorate, West Bank, adjacent to the Jordanian border, affecting a nomadic, mixed flock of unvaccinated sheep and goats (20211216.8700299). Samples for serotyping were sent to the laboratory of the Kimron Veterinary Institute, Israel and are assumed to have been serotyped (and genotyped?) by now; publication of the results is anticipated. Earlier FMD outbreaks in the West Bank and, more recently, in Israel (resolved by June 2021) were caused by FMDV O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2.

The FMD-O outbreak in Jabalia started on 13 Dec 2021, one day after the start of the event in Hadidiya, located about 130 km (as the crow flies; see map above) to its northeast. It is unlikely that there was contact between the two. The Gaza district ("Gaza strip") is separated from Israel (and the West Bank) by a (65 km [40.4 mi] long and 6 metres [19.7 ft] high) security fence; animal movements are forbidden. The affected beef cattle have, reportedly, been imported to Gaza 2 months ago. Results of the epidemiological investigation, in particular information on the cattle origin and route of transport, date of their past vaccination and composition of vaccine used, as well as genotyping results, if/when becoming available, are requested. The FMD strain last reported from Egypt was FMDV O/EA-3.

In the past, several East-African FMD serotypes were identified in the Gaza district: A, SAT-2 and O/EA-3. Recently, FMDV started circulating in Jordan, the West Bank and the Gaza district. Genotyping of all 3 is warranted to exclude (or otherwise) the possibility of a common origin. - Mod.AS
