The disease is, without doubt, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome [HFRS,
which is very usual and endemic for this area. For example, according to
the officially published statistical data, there were 2077 cases of this
disease in 1995, 1616 cases in 1996, 9403 cases in 1997 (absolute record,
because of large harvest of crops, warm and wet summer and other reasons)
ONLY in this Republic.
In all Russia there were more than 16 000 cases in 1997. I have no data for
Republic of Bashkortostan for 1998, but it was much lower than in 1997,
because for all Russia it was about 4 times less than in 1997.
Therefore it is not unusual to have 80 patients with this disease (HFRS) in
August.

[We thank Sergey for this reminder. We had completely forgotten that we had
reported on a similar epidemic in Bashkiria & nearby Orenburg in 1997 -- see
refs. above. The disease is caused by wild rodent-borne hantaviruses, the
strains differing according to geographical region: Puumala & Dobrava
viruses in Europe, Hantaan virus in Asia. Abundant harvests lead to
abundant rodents which multiply the viruses & bring them into contact with
field workers - Mod.JW
