Malaria is turning virulent (severe), as doctors at PGI [Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research] and Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) are coming across complicated symptoms, including renal failure, following the ailment. The condition is no more limited to chills and fever. The disease is also bringing along dengue-like dips in platelet counts and jaundice.

Besides Chandigarh, cases are pouring in from Karnal, Kurukshetra, Ropar, Yamunanagar, Kaithal and Saharanpur (UP), among others.

In the last 2 months [Aug-Sep 2013], 1148 samples have been collected from the 2 hospitals. "Of these, we found 30 positive for malaria. We have to get other tests and analyses done," said Dr Rakesh Sehgal, main investigator, PGI department of medical parasitology.

_Plasmodium vivax_ is the most common malaria found in India with a 50-80 percent prevalence. However, it does not result in complications as does falciparum, which is the most lethal form.

"We have been approached by medicine specialists at PGI and GMCH who have come across malaria cases in severe forms. These are due to vivax, but the symptoms are similar to the ones caused by falciparum. This is worrying. So we have started research to find the reason for the virulent form of malaria," said Dr Sehgal.

Cautious about the coming months when there might be a spurt in malaria cases, he said: "We will go to the areas where the incidence is high. The middle of the coming month [November] will be suitable for the survey, as malaria-causing mosquitoes breed during the season."

The unusual symptoms are baffling the doctors. "About 90 percent of our emergency is crowded with malaria cases of severe form. Patients are coming from Karnal, Kurukshetra, Ropar, Yamunanagar, Kaithal and Saharanpur (UP), among others," said a senior doctor of GMCH department of medicine.

Doctors have been seeing such cases for 2 to 3 years. Concerned over the increasing number of such patients over the years, PGI's medical parasitology department has initiated research to find out whether the genetics of malaria-causing parasites have changed or whether the response following the bite of the vector (on the human host) has undergone a change.

"We got worried when such cases started pouring in. We have entered into a collaborative study with GMCH to ascertain the cause. Once the cause is known, the problem can be tackled," he added.

Orissa has recorded the maximum number of cases of malaria in the January-July period this year [2013], followed by Chhattisgarh, while Kerala registered the largest number of dengue victims, followed by Karnataka.

89 466 cases of malaria were reported from Orissa followed by Chhattisgarh, which recorded 31 940 cases. Jharkhand reported 26 489 cases, while Maharashtra reported 17 060 cases followed by Gujarat, Assam, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh.

However, Maharashtra, which reported 17 060 cases of malaria, recorded the highest number of deaths at 24 followed by Orissa (20). No fatalities due to malaria were reported from any other state.

Visceral leishmaniasis
----------------------
The country was by and large free of Kala azar [visceral leishmaniasis] except for the states of Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal, which reported 5982, 1442 and 337 cases respectively by 31 Jul 2013 [this year]. According to the latest figures submitted by the Union Health Ministry to the Lok Sabha today [23 Aug 2013], a total of 262 582 cases with 78 deaths were reported in the country.

[Chandigar is located in the northwest part of India, an area endemic for _P. vivax_ and _P. falciparum_.

The finding that malaria produces thrombocytopenia [decrease in platelets] and jaundice is a result of late treatment and may not necessarily signal a more virulent form of the malaria parasite.

The posting does not mention which drug has been used for treatment. Resistance to chloroquine is widespread in _P. falciparum_ in India, and an artemisinin-based combination therapy, ACT, is preferred. _P. vivax_ should still be sensitive to chloroquine.

The 2nd report underlines that malaria is still endemic in several states of India. A recent review found that "Malaria cases in India started rising in 1970, peaking in 1976 to 6.45 million cases, and, thereafter, following the implementation of the Modified Plan of Operation in 1977, malaria cases declined and are now just over one million cases annually." However, the proportion due to _P. falciparum_ has in the same period increased from 10 to 50 percent (V. P. Sharma. Battling malaria iceberg incorporating strategic reforms in achieving Millennium Development Goals & malaria elimination in India. Indian J Med Res. 2012; 136: 907-925).
