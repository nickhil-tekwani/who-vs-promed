Poland has found its 1st case of COVID-19 in mink, the agriculture ministry said, raising fears of costly culls in an industry that counts over 350 farms in the country. With new variants of the coronavirus threatening global efforts to get the pandemic under control, authorities in several countries have begun mass culls of the animals due to fears of a mutated strain of the illness being transmitted to humans.

Late on Sunday [31 Jan 2021] the ministry said it had been informed by veterinary inspectors on Saturday [30 Jan 2021] of a case in Kartuzy county in northern Poland. "I hope this is a single case, although we must take all measures to limit possible transmission of the virus," deputy health minister Waldemar Kraska told local broadcaster Radio Gdansk on Monday [1 Feb 2021], adding that all mink at the affected farm would be culled.

Denmark, the world's top exporter of mink furs, ordered a cull of the country's entire population of some 17 million mink in 2020, and in January [2021] announced it would compensate farmers with up to DKK 19 billion (USD 3.09 billion).

In a statement sent to state-run news agency PAP, representatives of the Polish fur industry said the state was not offering any compensation for culled animals, and that they would launch a class action lawsuit demanding damages. The agriculture ministry did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

The Medical University of Gdansk said on 24 Nov [2020] it had found 8 cases of COVID-19 in mink at a farm in northern Poland [see comment], but veterinary inspectors later said there was no evidence of infection at the farm.

Poland is one of the world's top producers of mink fur, with 354 farms, containing around 6 million mink. (USD 1 = DKK 6.1444)

[Information on the event suspected by a university laboratory as the 1st COVID-19 infection in Polish minks, published by the media, was included in 20201127.7976927 (https://www.euronews.com/2020/11/24/polish-scientists-identify-first-cases-of-covid-19-at-a-mink-farm). The same posting included another report from the same media source, addressing the 1st COVID-19 mink infection in Poland's neighbor, Lithuania. In difference from Poland, where the media-sourced information was not confirmed by the authorities, Lithuania confirmed the information, officially notifying the OIE (20201203.7986508).

The current event in Poland, described in the above Reuters report, has now been officially reported to the OIE; see an immediate notification, including a map, submitted Wed 3 Feb 2021, at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=38036.

The given location of the affected mink farm, which includes 5845 animals, is Lezno, Zukowo, Kartuski [Kartuzy] county, in the northern province of Pomorskie (map at <tinyurl.com/1dnpbljr>). The farm is situated about 95 km [59 mi] from the Russian territory Kaliningrad and 285 km [177 mi] from the Lithuanian border. Further data from the OIE notification follows:

- Date of start of the outbreak: 27 Jan 2021
- Affected population: At the mink farm, nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 20 mink; 4 animals were positive in RT-PCR. No clinical cases.
- Epidemiological comments: The samples were collected as a part of active monitoring, in accordance with applicable national regulations.

It may be assumed that this event reflects a human-to-animal infection, as seen in the 1st cases in all other countries that have reported COVID-19 in their respective farmed mink.

The Netherlands was the 1st country to apply systematic surveillance in farmed minks shortly after the detection of the 1st human-to-mink infection in North Brabant, late April 2020. Since then, COVID-19 continued its spread in the Dutch farmed mink while closely being monitored and studied, with findings published and shared continuously internationally. The later discovery of animal-to-human cases, caused by a mink-sourced mutation, led to a decision to terminate mink farming in the Netherlands. A similar disease history and outcome took place later in Denmark. Other countries that have reported COVID-19 in minks are Canada, France, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Spain, Sweden, and USA, to which Poland has now been officially been added. There are other countries known to maintain a considerable mink farming industry, such as China, Finland, and Russia. Details on surveillance activities undertaken in minks of these countries have not become available. - Mod.AS
