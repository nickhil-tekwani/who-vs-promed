Mysterious Virus Drives Up the Price of Pearls
A mysterious virus has teamed up with disruptive weather patterns to kill
more than half the oysters in the world's busiest undersea factory.
At first, shoppers at jewelry counters were blissfully unaware of all this
because dealers, alerted to the blight, kept plenty of pearls on hand. But
those supplies are running short, and suddenly -- just in time for prom and
wedding season -- pearl prices are shooting up. Luxury chains like Tiffany
& Company as well as small, family-owned jewelers like Wilson & Son in
Scarsdale, N.Y., have been forced to raise prices, in some cases by as much
as 25 percent, for top-quality strands. And prices are still rising.
In 1996, the last year for which full figures are available, 150 million
Akoya mollusks died, according to the exporters' group. Cultured pearls
dominate the American market, and half of them come from Japanese Akoya
oysters.
The problem has been building for a decade but became acute in 1996 and
1997, said Ichiro Nomura, a director of resources and environmental
research at the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in
Tokyo. "The cause of increased death is yet to be known fully, and
scientists of our agency are making their best efforts to identify it," he
said.
When they first received word of the dying oysters, retailers increased
their pearl orders and, for a time, had a surplus. But as the death rate
accelerated, and inventories fell, retailers say they had no choice but to
pass higher costs on to customers. The biggest price increase is for
top-quality pearls, which even in a good year account for less than 5
percent of a total harvest. "All we can do is stay away from these areas
considered the problem," said Koichi Takahashi, senior vice president of
the Mikimoto (America) Company, the largest distributor of cultured pearls
in the United States, which operates its own oyster farm in Japan.
A necklace of low-quality Akoya pearls now costs 15 percent to 20 percent
more than it did last year. But at roughly $500, that is about a third what
a high-quality string costs. Cheaper ones are also in short supply but not
as severely as the finest pearls.
Once, natural pearls were the only ones available. But a century ago it was
discovered that a foreign object could be inserted into an oyster to
stimulate the formation of a pearl, giving rise to cultured pearls, which
now make up about 70 percent of the American market. The rest is split
between Tahitian and South Sea pearls, the most expensive variety, and
freshwater pearls, the cheapest. These pearls are not affected by the Akoya
problem.
There is one bright spot for some oyster farmers -- edible oysters have not
been as hard hit. Those oysters, which are different from Akoyas, are grown
in separate farms that the virus has not ravaged. As for the Akoyas,
farmers were first alerted to the problem when scientists noticed that an
increasing number of oyster muscles were turning red or brown, which
signaled that they were likely to die. Farmers then began to isolate
healthy oysters, but even that did not make a difference.
Three factors are generally accepted as the most serious causes: climate
changes, red tide -- a severe rise in plankton, microscopic organisms found
naturally in the water that cause the color to turn red and kill the
oysters -- and an unrelated mystery virus. Speculations about other
possibilities range from the use of chemicals in fish farming to poor
oxygen levels in water because of overcrowding of oysters in cages.
Red tide and unpredictable weather have sent the pearl industry into
turmoil at various times over the years, but the virus that has scientists
perplexed is a relatively new. Scientists are not sure of its origin, but
they think that once it took hold, unseasonably warm weather increased
water temperatures and enabled it to thrive.

[This report gives no indication that a virus has been isolated, much less
cultured and identified. If any of our Asian members have any information
on this mystery virus, it would be appreciated if they would share it with
us. - Mod.MHJ]
