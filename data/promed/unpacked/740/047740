Two outbreaks of anthrax have occurred in the opening weeks of January 2012. The 1st occurred in the Partido of Guamini where 4 adult cattle died in a herd of 100 animals grazing a natural pasture. The weather during the previous period of November-December [2011] had been very dry, but there had been showers immediately preceding the animals' deaths. The animals had not been vaccinated; they died suddenly with extravasation of blood from their natural openings [mouth, nose, vagina, anus]. The Partido of Guaqmini has been part of the rural anthrax surveillance area in the Province of Buenos Aires since 1977.

The 2nd outbreak occurred in the Partido of Olavarria (Epigas), where 6 female cattle died over 40 days out of a herd of 25 grazing a natural pasture along with some horses. The livestock had not been vaccinated, although the zone had known outbreaks in the past. The Partido has had 8 outbreaks in the period of 2005 up to the present. It also is part of the provincial rural anthrax surveillance area since 1977.

Both outbreaks were handled using the standard "Tabado Controlado" technique [covering the carcasses with lime and placing over each a thick plastic tarp weighted down along its edges; these tarps are removed after some 9 months, and then the carcass remains (hide, bones) are removed and incinerated or buried].

[Although there is a vaccination order in place in the Buenos Aires surveillance zone, it is not universally observed as these 2 incidents demonstrate. The good news is that these unnecessary outbreaks can be used to persuade other procrastinators to vaccinate their stock. We have seen the same situation play out in the eastern counties of the US Dakotas, where the American procrastinators reinforce the message to the others, who, if they have vaccinated their animals, do not see them die of this disease in a high risk area. Of course, if they had vaccinated, their stock would not be at risk of increasing the site contamination, which over time and relatively quickly would be freed of live pathogenic anthrax spores.

Our thanks to Ramon for this report. - Mod.MHJ
