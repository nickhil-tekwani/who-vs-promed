RABBIT VIRAL HEMORRHAGIC DISEASE (14)
*************************************
A ProMED-mail post
[see
Rabbit viral hemorrhagic disease (13) 970924215145]
Date: 26 September 1997
From: Charles H. Calisher <calisher@usa.healthnet.org>

Here is an up-to-date summary of reports we have received recently:
1. In high rainfall areas of Australia RHDV (called rabbit
calicivirus, RCV) is effective. In arid and semi-arid areas rabbit
mortality is as high as 95% but feral cats and foxes, deprived of their
traditional prey, are decimating native animals and birds but, to date, no
declines in small mammal or reptile populations have been noted.
2. Rabbits are out-breeding the spread of the disease in areas with
rainfall of more than 300mm per annum, and the government will try to speed
up the natural spread of the virus with a bait delivery program.
3. The virus is being re-released at 11 sites "where initial releases
did not cause an obvious decline in rabbit numbers."
4. Rabbits fewer than eight weeks old are not susceptible to RHDV
and those aged 8-12 weeks are protected by maternal antibodies, obviously
from females that survived infection.
5. There are murmurs of "climatic factors" and "environmental
conditions" complicating things.
6. The Australian Government is intensively studying sites where
infected rabbits have been released.
7. In response to my query, Tony Robinson, Chairman of the Science
Subcommittee of the Australian RCD Program, Lyneham, ACT, provided
information regarding the source of the RHDV released in Australia. It was
obtained from the Czech Republic as strain CAPM V-351. Thanks Tony for
this information. We still do not know the origin of the strain released
in New Zealand. If it came from Australia it may be the same CAPM V-351
and, if that's the case, then questions regarding "theirs" vs. "ours" may
be irrelevant.
8. The Victoria Weekly Times has reported that CSIRO scientists
have summarized some vector transmission studies by saying that at least 10
species of insects are capable of "spreading" RHDV and quoted CSIRO's Brian
Cooke as saying that the virus was found in 7 species of flies, 2 of
mosquitoes and in rabbit fleas. Of course, this doesn't say much at all.
Almost any infectious agent can be transmitted mechanically and this is
important. Questions still relate to a replicative cycle in arthropods. A
definitive report would be welcome and useful for our understanding of this
problem.
--------
I have omitted the more inflammatory messages we have received.
If you are planning to send one, don't. Criticism, however, is always
welcome.
This rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) experience is fascinating and
I, for one, would like to receive all the details and to receive them from
an authority, not second or third hand from a "media source". From time to
time we have had the splendid cooperation of certain New Zealand and
Australian officials. That has been excellent and we are grateful.
