Two more companies voluntarily recalled meat Friday after deadly _Listeria_
bacteria, which recently killed 11 people, were reportedly found in their
products. The action raises to four the number of companies recalling their
meat out of concern for _Listeria_ over the past month. In one case
involving meat produced by Bil Mar Foods, a division of Sara Lee Corp, at
least 11 people died and three women had miscarriages, according to the
Centres for Disease Control. Agriculture Department officials said there
was no evidence to link the cases. No illnesses have been reported in
connection with the new recalls, officials said.
On Friday, Thorn Apple Valley Inc. recalled hot dogs and luncheon kits
produced over six months at its Forrest City, Ark., plant after government
tests discovered _Listeria_ bacteria in meat produced by the Southfield,
Mich.-based company. Recalled products include "EST 13529" and "EST
P-13529" on the packaging. Thorn Apple Valley is recalling products
produced from July 6 through Dec. 30 that were sold nationwide by a variety
of companies and packaged under different names, including Kroger and
Safeway grocery stores. The products were also sold to companies in South
Korea and in Russia, the department said. Agriculture Department and
company officials said they did not know the quantity of meat that was
being recalled in the case, but some said that due to the broad range of
production dates, the amount was sure to be big.
>From July to December, the Agriculture Department said tests found
_Listeria_ in five out of 20 ready-to-eat product samples it collected.
"Based on these repetitive findings, as well as conditions found in the
plant, the agency concluded that there may be a significant public health
risk associated with the product being recalled," the department said in a
statement. The Agriculture Department withdrew its meat inspectors from the
Forrest City plant on Dec. 31, effectively shutting it down after the
company did not comply with "sanitation requirements," the USDA said. The
plant remains closed.
In the second case announced Friday, Bosell Foods, Inc., of Cleveland
recalled 350 pounds -- a tiny amount by meat production standards -- of
sliced ham. The meat was only distributed in the Cleveland area, the USDA
said. Involved in the recall are half-pound packages of the "Dinner Bell"
Virginia Brand Cooked Ham, Water Added, with sell-by code 2-18-1999.
Packages are marked with EST 2587 in the USDA seal.
A week ago, Oscar Mayer Foods, a unit of Philip Morris Cos. , voluntarily
recalled two types of luncheon meat after an elderly man in Kansas City,
Mo., became sick after eating the company's deli meat. Agriculture
Department tests discovered _Listeria_ bacteria in samples of the meat. Bil
Mar's voluntary nationwide recall began a month ago and company officials
said they expected to retrieve approximately 15 million pounds of meat. The
company Wednesday took out full-page advertisements in 60 U.S. newspapers
to apologize to customers...

Poultry hotline, 800-535-4555, Thorn Apple Valley, 800-316-2855, or Bosell
