[After a week with no wild poliovirus (WPV) isolates, a positive environmental sample (ES) was reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Tribal Districts, serving as a reminder that the WPV1 is still circulating in Pakistan. As for cVDPV activity, Nigeria continues to confirm cVDPV2 cases and Madagascar, while not confirming AFP cases, the positive ES for cVDPV1 is an indicator that the virus is still circulating.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Gambia - cVDPV2

We received a reply from an EpiCore member in response to an RFI (request for information). The reply confirmed that as of yesterday (20 Aug 2021) there had been 2 positive environmental samples identified -- 1 in Banjul and 1 in Kotu that were positive for cVDPV2. But as of yesterday (20 Aug 2021) there were no confirmed cases of AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) associated with cVDPV2 in the Gambia.

"In May 2021, with support from the World Health Organisation and other partners, The Gambia initiated environmental surveillance to supplement the traditional (Acute Flaccid Paralysis-AFP) polio surveillance system. Presently, environmental samples are collected from 3 sites. Samples collected from AFP cases and the environment are sent to the regional polio laboratory in Dakar for analysis." Dr. Samateh [the Minister of Health, The Gambia] explained.

"He noted that no AFP sample from The Gambia has tested positive for polio. However, 2 environmental samples collected from sewage sites, 1 from Banjul and the other from Kotu have tested positive for poliovirus type 2.

"'This has created a polio outbreak situation in the country since a single positive poliovirus case is considered an outbreak under the 2005 International Health Regulations, thereby requiring an urgent response to breaking transmission.'

"He added that sequencing results showed that the viruses detected in The Gambia are genetically linked to other viruses detected in Guinea, Senegal, and Nigeria which indicated evidence of importation. He noted that the outbreak is an evidence of poliovirus circulation within the population but does not mean a detection of polio paralysis in the population."

[Repeating my mod comment in Poliomyelitis update (19): global (cVDPV2) Gambia, Pakistan, RFI 20210813.8591368, "In the 30 Jul 2021 update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), there were 2 cVDPV2 positive environmental samples reported in the Western Region. The isolates were identified as genetically linked to the Jigawa outbreak in Nigeria (see Poliomyelitis update (17): global (cVDPV1,cVDPV2 Uganda/Gambia) Pakistan, Nigeria 20210730.8557717)." Noteworthy is the mention that environmental sampling began in May 2021. No further positive ESs have been identified since the report on 30 Jul 2021. Hopefully the planned vaccination response to these findings will interrupt transmission and circulation of the cVDPV2.

[3] Uganda - cVDPV2

The Ministry of Health has declared polio a Public Health Emergency in Uganda following confirmation of positive laboratory tests from environmental samples in Kampala. The samples were collected from the sewage plants in Bugolobi and Lbigi which are 2 of the sentinel environmental surveillance sites in Kampala. Results from the tests carried out at Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) confirmed a circulating Vaccine Derived Polio Virus type 2(cVDPV2). The virus detected has genetic linkage with a cVDPV2 strain reported in Sudan.

Uganda and the entire Africa were certified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as wild-polio virus free in August 2020. Polio is a viral disease that is transmitted from person to person, mainly through a faecal-oral route or, less frequently, through contaminated water or food, and multiplies inside the intestines. However, polio resurged with another strain known as the 'Circulating Vaccine Derived Poliovirus (cVDPV)' that affects children in the communities with low immunity levels. In the past 12 months, over 19 African countries have declared cVDPV2 outbreaks, including 3 countries bordering Uganda: the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), South Sudan, and Kenya.

While mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic, delivery of essential health services including routine immunization have been affected considerably, which implies fewer numbers of children were immunized against the vaccine-preventable diseases. This slowdown has led to resurgence of polio globally, including Uganda.

The resurgence of polio in Uganda may be attributed to the reduced routine immunization and polio immunization rates in the country during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, incessant cross-border movements among our neighbouring countries and the countries from the Horn of Africa region currently affected by cVDPV2 outbreaks pose a risk of further polio-importations to the country.

Polio does not respect borders and is spreading fast in the East African region putting children -- particularly aged 5 years and below -- at the risk of contracting this incurable disease yet vaccine preventable disease.

In response to the polio outbreak, the Ministry of Health has heightened surveillance of polio in the country by intensifying search for polio cases in all health facilities by reporting and investigation of all children under 15 years with sudden onset of paralysis or weakness in the arms or legs and expansion of environmental surveillance.

Additionally, the Ministry will conduct a nationwide polio immunization campaign in October and December 2021 during which health-workers will visit house-to-house and vaccinate all children aged 5 years or below against polio. All health workers participating in the campaign will wear masks and strictly observe the COVID-19 SOPs to ensure children are safely vaccinated.

In the meantime, parents and guardians are encouraged to ensure that all children under the age of 5 years are fully immunized as per the country's routine immunization schedule.

The resurgence of polio in Uganda is an indication that children have not been fully vaccinated. Dr Annet Kisakye, the immunization focal person at the World Health Organization Uganda office says that while the Ministry of Health is attributing the outbreak to cross border movement from South Sudan, there's a big gap in immunization in the capital city with a lot of children only taking bits of the 3-dose jabs.

Kisakye's revelations are corroborated by a recent survey by researchers at Makerere University School of Public Health which found major gaps in immunization among both upscale residents of the city and slum dwellers. According to the study which has been done in 2 phases from June 2019 to May 2020, and from June 2020 to July 2021, 41.8% of the children living in Kampala slums have not been fully vaccinated for routinely scheduled immunisable diseases including polio. Almost the same number at 40.9% of children living in areas inhabited by the affluent like Kololo have also not been vaccinated.

With such worrying trends, Kisakye says once the 2 samples were picked through sentinel surveillance in Lubigi and Bugolobi late last month [July 2021], they embarked on random stool testing among children in Kampala and so far the results have come out negative. 120 samples have been tested.

The fear according to experts like Kisakye is that the virus has been circulating in Uganda undetected longer than the authorities could estimate. Already, genome sequencing by a laboratory in South Africa where Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) sent the samples for further analysis has found that the virus mutated about 28 times from the closest match of mutants. Dr Henry Mwebesa, the Director-General of Health Services in the Ministry of Health acknowledges the fact that the virus could have been here longer. "Such undetected transmission suggests that there are gaps in the national polio surveillance sensitivity that need to be identified and corrected urgently", he said.

Mwebesa noted that the country is planning to conduct a quick polio immunization campaign in October [2021] where children under the age of 5 [years] will be given an oral booster dose. The exercise will be conducted house to house to ensure that every child is reached.

[According to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative update that reported the initial positive ESs in Uganda, the virus was identified as associated with the outbreak ongoing in Chad. These more recent reports link the virus with that circulating in the Sudan but further investigation reveals the outbreak in Sudan was linked to that in Chad -- a good demonstration of the high mobility of the population and the impact on virus circulation/transmission.
