WHO Update number 130 - Influenza update - 25 Mar 2011
------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Influenza activity in most areas of the northern hemisphere temperate
regions appears to have peaked and is declining. Although the level of
pneumonia and influenza mortality in the United States of America
(USA) is above the epidemic threshold and many states still are
reporting on widespread activity, most indicators on influenza
activity in North America are indicating decreasing influenza
activity. As activity in the Americas declines, influenza A(H1N1)2009
has increased proportionately and now accounts for 38 percent of all
virus detections. In Europe the peak has been passed in most countries
and all countries now report medium or low influenza activity. Cases
of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections in Europe are decreasing but
still above baseline in some parts of Eastern Europe. Influenza
viruses in Europe continue to be primarily influenza A(H1N1)2009,
about 70 percent of all viruses characterized, and influenza type B,
making up about 28 percent of all viruses. Data from parts of Northern
Africa show that there is ongoing community transmission of both
influenza A(H1N1l)2009 and influenza type B in Tunisia and Algeria.
The large majority of the viruses characterized are closely related to
the vaccine strains included in the current seasonal vaccines. Viruses
which have been characterized antigenically continue to be largely
related to the lineages found in the current trivalent seasonal
vaccine except for a small number of influenza B viruses of the
Yamagata lineage.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America: Influenza activity in North America is decreasing in
both Canada and the USA. In Canada, most regions report either
declining or stable activity. The influenza like-illness (ILI)
consultation rate fell from 37.4 to 25.3 per 1000 patient visits in
epidemiological week 10 and is now below the expected rate for this
time of year. New hospitalizations with laboratory-confirmed influenza
among both adults and children also declined in the same period. Since
the beginning of the season, 93 percent of all influenza viruses have
been type A. Of the influenza A viruses subtyped, 86 percent have been
influenza A(H3N2). Detections of influenza type B have been increasing
proportionately since late January and now accounts for 28 percent of
all influenza positive specimens. Seventy-eight percent of 185 fatal
influenza cases reported from nine provinces and territories were in
patients aged 65 years or older. 91 percent of the subtyped influenza
A viruses in the fatal adult cases have been H3N2, and less than 3
percent influenza type B. In the USA, the ILI consultation rate fell 3
percent but is still above the national baseline. Reported deaths due
to pneumonia and influenza from the 122 city surveillance system also
remain above the epidemic threshold for this time of the year. During
epidemiological week 10, 11 children were reported to have died of
influenza related illness, making a total of 71 pediatric deaths since
October 2010. The overall proportion of samples testing positive for
influenza in week 10 has decreased from 27 percent to 21 percent.
Virus detections in the USA were primarily H3N2 and type B early in
the season, however, the proportion of detections due to influenza
A(H1N1)2009 have steadily increased and now account for 43 percent of
all the subtyped influenza A viruses. Mexico reports a low number of
influenza virus detections, with influenza type B as the most frequent
virus.

Europe: All influenza indicators in Europe continue to decline since
the last report. 37 of the 53 Member States in the WHO European Region
have passed a peak of the ILI or Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI)
surveillance in recent weeks. All countries reported either medium or
low influenza activity, and only Bulgaria reported increased activity.
Cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) in the European
Economic Area (EEA) peaked at the end of December 2010 but still
remain above pre-season levels in the Eastern European countries
(Georgia, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine). In
the EEA, the most frequently reported risk factor for severe influenza
infections is obesity. In week 10 the proportion of samples testing
positive for influenza among sentinel doctors was 46 percent. Of all
influenza virus detections that were reported this season, 72 percent
were influenza A and 28 percent were influenza B. Of the influenza A
viruses that were subtyped 97 percent were influenza A(H1N1)2009 and 3
percent were influenza A(H3N2). Since week 40, 2010, and similar to
North America, nearly all influenza A viruses characterized this
season in Europe have been antigenically similar to the H1N1 and H3N2
strains included in the current trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine.
Approximately 93 percent of influenza type B viruses characterized are
also of the same lineage as those in the current vaccine (Victoria)
with the remainder being of the Yamagata lineage.

North Africa and the Middle East: Influenza activity in North Africa
and the Middle East is moderate with influenza A(H1N1)2009 and
influenza B viruses co-circulating. The number of confirmed cases in
Algeria has increased over the last several weeks, with nearly 60
cases of influenza A(H1N1)2009 reported during 7-12 March. Tunisia has
had continued activity during the last few weeks with nearly 30 cases
of co-circulating influenza A(H1N1)2009 and influenza B reported. In
the Middle East, influenza activity in Oman and Iran remain moderate
with approximately 50 confirmed influenza cases in each country, while
the number of confirmed cases in Pakistan has decreased to less than
20.

Northern Asia: Overall, influenza activity in northern Asia continues
to decline. In north China, ILI activity has remained low and below
the activity level observed during the last three seasons. ILI
activity in Japan has seen a slight increase after several weeks of
decreasing activity. The proportion of ILI patients has remained
stable in the Republic of Korea after a declining trend seen over the
last several weeks. The majority of cases involve influenza
A(H1N1)2009, with influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B circulating in
lower numbers.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Influenza activity in the tropics remains low in most areas with
co-circulation of influenza B and influenza A(H1N1)2009. For the most
part, sporadic activity is reported in regions of Central America, the
Caribbean and the Andean Region. However, in Guatemala, the proportion
of positive respiratory viruses among the tested samples has increased
to 37 percent during 28 Feb - 4 Mar 2011, compared to 6 percent in the
previous week. In Ecuador, the percentage of samples positive for
respiratory viruses increased slightly from the previous week to
approximately 30 percent. In Sub-Saharan Africa, limited available
data indicate low levels of co-circulating influenza A and influenza B
viruses. However, influenza activity has been increasing in Kenya,
with 17 influenza B cases, 11 influenza A(H1N1)2009 cases, and 1
influenza A(H3N2) case during epidemiological week 10, compared to a
total of 18 cases the previous week. Madagascar also reports low level
persistent activity primarily associated with influenza type B.
Influenza activity in tropical Asia remains low with the majority of
cases involving influenza B and influenza A(H1N1)2009. In south China,
the percent ILI of sentinel hospital visits decreased to 3 percent
during week 10 from 3.3 percent the previous week. This is lower than
the level seen during the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 seasons (3.4 percent
and 3.3 percent respectively).

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Influenza activity remains low in most regions in the temperate zone
of the southern hemisphere. However, Australia reports persistent
low-level of out-of-season influenza activity, primarily in the
northern tropical areas of the country. Influenza A(H3N2) is the
predominant virus in Australia.

Virological surveillance
------------------------
During weeks 9 to 10, laboratory detections of influenza A(H1N1)2009,
A(H3N2) and B viruses continued to be reported in many parts of Asia,
Europe and North Americas, though virus activity in general was low.
In the northern hemisphere and tropical regions, a general decline in
activity was observed for both H1N1 (2009) and B viruses that
co-circulated in some countries. In Europe, decreased activity was
observed for both H1N1 (2009) and B viruses that co-circulated. In
Asia, influenza A(H1N1)2009 viruses continued to predominate, while
influenza B viruses were slightly predominant in Africa with
co-circulation of A(H3N2) viruses. In the United States of America,
influenza A(H1N1)2009, A(H3N2) and B viruses co-circulated, while in
Canada, the predominant viruses continued to be influenza A(H3N2). In
the southern hemisphere, influenza activity was low with
influenzaA(H1N1)2009, A(H3N2) and B viruses detected in few countries.
The vast majority of characterized viruses from the 2010-2011
influenza season remain antigenically similar to the viruses WHO
recommended for the 2010-2011 northern hemisphere influenza vaccines.

FluNet reports
--------------
During weeks 9 to 10 (27 February 2011 to 12 March 2011), National
Influenza Centres (NICs) from 71 countries, areas or territories
reported data to FluNet. A total of 13 496 specimens were reported as
positive for influenza viruses, 9379 (69.5 percent) were typed as
influenza A and 4117 (30.5 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed
influenza A viruses reported, 76.7 percent were influenza A(H1N1)2009
and 23.3 percent were influenza A(H3N2).
