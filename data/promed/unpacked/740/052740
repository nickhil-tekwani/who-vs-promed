Cases of vesicular stomatitis (VS) continue to be detected in Texas, New
Mexico, and Colorado, but the disease appears to be occurring at lower
levels than in previous years. As of 22 Jul 2004, 9 premises in Texas, and
11 in New Mexico, are under quarantine due to VS infection. In Colorado, 10
horses and 3 head of cattle are quarantined on premises in 4 counties. The
viral infection, thought to be spread by sand flies or black flies, can
cause horses, cattle, and other livestock to develop blister-like lesions
that can take several weeks to heal.
"Nationally, fewer cases [have been seen] than in 1997, when the disease
was confirmed on 380 premises before the outbreak ended in late fall," said
Dr. Max Coats, deputy director for Animal Health Programs for the Texas
Animal Health Commission (TAHC), the state's livestock and poultry health
regulatory agency. "I don't recall Texas ever having this many confirmed
cases -- a total of 11 so far -- or seeing them as far east as Starr
County. Usually, Texas's lone case or 2 is detected in far west Texas."
"Even though the case numbers have remained fairly low, some states
receiving livestock have imposed movement restrictions, or testing
requirements, as a precaution against potential disease spread," said Dr.
Coats. "Therefore, we urge livestock owners to check with the state
veterinarian's office, in the state of destination prior to travel, to
ensure all requirements are met. States with movement restrictions include
Kentucky, Tennessee, and New Jersey, which depend on their healthy horse
industry."
The country's 1st confirmed case of VS in 2004 was detected in horses on a
premise in Reeves County, Texas, in mid-May. The TAHC quarantine was
released 10 Jul 2004, after a regulatory veterinarian inspected the
livestock on the site several times and found the animals to be fully
healed. Likewise, a quarantine in Val Verde County was released 16 Jul
2004, leaving 9 premises in 5 Texas counties under VS quarantine. The
quarantined premises include 5 sites in Starr County, 2 of which include
infected cattle. Horses comprise the remainder of the Texas cases, located
on one premise each in Dimmit, Uvalde, Kerr, and Yoakum Counties. Maps can
be reviewed at:
<http://www.tahc.state.tx.us>.
Colorado currently has confirmed cases of VS in 10 horses and 3 cattle. The
infection has been detected in Douglas, Las Animas, Park, and Pueblo
counties. Updates on the Colorado cases can be accessed on the internet at:
<http://www.ag.state.co.us>.
New Mexico has horses on 11 premises, in 4 counties, under quarantine.
These include 6 small premises "clustered" in Eddy County, near Carlsbad. 3
sites in Valencia County remain under movement restriction as well as one
each in San Miguel and Grant counties.
"Please report signs of illness in livestock that resemble vesicular
stomatitis," urged Dr. Coats. "These can include blisters, or erosions, in
an animal's mouth, or, on the muzzle, on the teats, or above the hooves. VS
can affect horses and other equine animals, cattle, deer, goats, swine, and
a number of other animals. Tests will be run, at no charge to the owner, so
that we can ensure that we are, in fact, dealing with VS and not the highly
dangerous foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], which exhibits similar signs of
disease in cloven-hoofed animals." Dr. Coats noted that horses, and other
equine animals, are not susceptible to FMD, but tests can rule out other
causes of illness, such as poison, toxic plants, or other diseases.
To report potential signs of VS, owners and practitioners should contact
their state veterinarian's office, so that a disease investigation, and
appropriate testing, can be conducted:
