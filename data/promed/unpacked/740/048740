A Hong Kong newspaper (Ming Pao) reported that Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Commission announced that 5 sets of samples (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, lymph nodes, and tonsil) were collected for PCR testing. Porcine circovirus, PCV2 was detected in one set of samples (did not say from which organs). All other sets of samples were tested negative for FMD [foot-and-mouth disease], swine fever, PRRS [porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome], pseudorabies, and porcine epidemic diarrhea.

Porcine circovirus is one of the diseases that killed many pigs now floating down a river in Songjiang District, the Shanghai Agricultural Commission said this morning [11 Mar 2013].

By yesterday [10 Mar 2013], more than 1200 dead pigs had been removed from the river. Experts from the Shanghai Animal Diseases Control and Prevention Centre collected hearts, livers, spleens, lungs, lymph nodes, and tonsils from 5 carcasses retrieved last Friday [8 Mar 2013].

They found 6 viral pathogens in the samples. One pig was tested positive of porcine circovirus, an epidemic common among pigs in recent years. But the virus is not a zoonosis and will not infect humans, the commission said.

Experts are still investigating the causes of dead pigs dumped by pig farms upstream in neighboring Zhejiang Province.

Chinese authorities said they found more than 3300 dead pigs in a river that supplies water to Shanghai, a stark illustration of China's problems with environmental pollution.

Sanitation workers retrieve dead pigs along the Huangpu River, which supplies water to Shanghai, on Sunday [10 Mar 2013].

Health and agricultural authorities in Shanghai said on Monday [11 Mar 2013] they were investigating any potential health impact from pigs found floating in the Huangpu River and nearby waters in recent days, as well as how they got there. The river, which supplies Shanghai's 23 million residents with most of their water, winds toward downtown from the point about 43 mi [69.2 km] south of where the pigs were found.

Authorities had little immediate explanation on how so many dead pigs ended up the river or what killed them.

Pork is China's primary meat and its approximately half a billion pigs often live in conditions ripe for spreading disease. One industry expert said the mass deaths indicated a disease outbreak, possibly on a single farm.

Chinese social media lit up Monday [11 Mar 2013] with photos of masked workers using pitchforks and bamboo poles to remove bruised pig carcasses from the river's brackish waters and its filthy embankments.

More than 2800 dead pigs have been fished from a Shanghai river, one of the Chinese city's main water supplies. Authorities say the carcasses have had "no significant effect" on water quality. It was not immediately known who dumped the animals. The unsightly nature of what appeared to be a large-scale disposal so close to downtown Shanghai shocked a nation usually complacent about debris clogging its waterways and raised questions not just of what killed the pigs, but also of China's methods and systems for handling animal deaths.

Shanghai officials said they had found no health threat in the city's water, though a spokeswoman for one city waterworks said extra precautions were being taken in its treatment for tap usage. Authorities said one test detected a pig-borne disease in the river called porcine circovirus, which doesn't normally affect humans, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Media reports quoted residents saying they started seeing dead pigs on Thursday [7 Mar 2013]. The Shanghai Water Authority said its 1st reports came in on Friday evening [8 Mar 2013].

Floating pigs aren't Shanghai's only water pollution problem this year [2013], despite years of effort by local authorities to improve local waterways. Residents near where pigs were being pulled from the river went days in January without tap water when a chemical transporter leaked benzene into a Huangpu River tributary. More than 20 people were hospitalized in the incident, which left others to obtain water from fire trucks.

Such incidents have thrust the environment onto the agenda of this year's National People's Congress, China's annual legislative meeting in session in Beijing. Outgoing premier Wen Jiabao last week in his work report, similar to the State of the Union address in the US, cited environmental protection plans more than a dozen times.

Air quality in Beijing and other Chinese cities reached hazardous levels during the winter, sickening residents and prompting many to wear masks. In February, a government bureau sparked widespread public grumbling when it said soil-quality statistics were a state secret. Rivers across 3 northern provinces were also sullied by a chemical leak earlier this year.

The pigs mark a new twist. "It's unheard of," said Yao Songqiao, a Beijing-based consultant with International Rivers, a nongovernmental organization that focuses on protecting waterways. "On the other hand, working in the environmental protection area [teaches you] anything can happen."

The specter of dead pigs fouling a crucial source of drinking water also highlighted the parallel issue of food safety. The concern isn't limited to domestic producers: US fast-food giant Yum Brands Inc. in recent months has fended off accusations by state media of subpar chicken served by its KFC chain. Beijing this month [March 2013] said it would streamline the food-regulation regime, in part to address safety concerns.

"This incident shows what we need to improve our work," Chen Xiaohua, China's vice minister for agriculture, told reporters in Beijing on Monday [11 Mar 2013]. He added that authorities need to better educate farmers and improve the official response to animal health problems.

Pigs suffer a wide variety of illnesses. A 2007 outbreak of high-fever blue ear disease [porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome] killed around 50 million pigs, according to British and Chinese researchers. The World Organization for Animal Heath [OIE] reported in January [2013] that Chinese authorities culled 948 pigs in southern Guangdong province after an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease there. Mr Chen said there are no signs of an epidemic but noted the approaching springtime is the key period to prevent disease. Research firm Genesus Genetics estimates China's total pig population at more than 470 million.

The Huangpu River is fed by numerous waterways that begin in the industrial agricultural provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu, where Shanghai authorities suspect the animals originated. After passing through downtown Shanghai, it empties into the Yangtze River.

[PCV2 is considered as the causative agent of post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), which was initially identified in Canada during the early 1990s. PMWS has become a major cause of wasting disease in swine-producing areas including Asia, North America, and Europe.

The possible involvement of porcine circovirus in a major health problem affecting porcines in China has been discussed earlier in ProMED-mail posting 20060924.2732 (24 Sep 2006, see http://www.promedmail.org/direct.php?id=20060924.2732). It related to an undiagnosed syndrome which had started in June 2006, affecting pig farms in 6 provinces (Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hubei) as well as some southern provinces. The syndrome was given by the media the title "high-fever blue ear disease" or "pig high fever disease". Following a request for information from the OIE, a report was submitted by China's chief veterinary officer, which included, among other data, the following:

..."By epidemiological investigation and laboratory testing of 582 samples of pathogenic material, we have discovered that this disease is closely related to the mixed infection of classical swine fever [CSF] , porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome [PRRS], and porcine circovirus. Of all the pathogenic samples, 263 samples (45 per cent) were positive for PRRS; 167 samples (29.2 per cent) were positive for classical swine fever (CSF); 130 samples (22.3 per cent) were positive for porcine circovirus (PCV2); 17 samples were positive for Aujeszky's disease [pseudorabies]; 6 samples were positive for _Streptococcus suis_; one sample was positive for pasteurellosis infection, and 47 samples were positive for porcine contagious pleuropneumonia infection. Samples that tested positive for PRRS, CFS, or PCV2 account for 96.5 per cent of the total of the samples tested. We also tested 80 samples from sick pigs for African swine fever with polymerase chain reaction as recommended by the Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals. All of the results were negative, and the possibility of African swine fever can therefore be ruled out. A similar swine disease was also found in some southern provinces of China in hot summers during the last few years."

Later on, many of the cases were eventually diagnosed as PRRS (see references in the "see also" section below).

The current reported identification of porcine circovirus PCV2 is, thus, not surprising. On the other hand, its exclusive or main role as the causative agent of the current problem has yet to be established, excluding other candidates such as FMD, CSF, and PRRS.

Epidemiological investigations at source -- on the affected farms -- are needed in order to finally elucidate the current animal health situation on pig farms in Zhejiang and Jiangsu, and to allow for appropriate measures to be applied to control it, for the sake of animal and human health. - Mod.AS
