According to a circular of the Field Veterinary Service (FVS) dated 28 Dec 2022 (circulated 29 Dec 2022; at https://tinyurl.com/5btm9yp8), the affected beef-cattle herd is owned by a villager from Buq'ata. The herd, kept between Buq'ata and El-Rom (map at https://tinyurl.com/2krhxesm), includes a total of 80 adult cows and 40 younger animals (heifers and calves born between 2020-2022). The above WOAH report deals with a group of 71 head, held separately, of which 60% were clinically affected. The (entire?) herd had been vaccinated on 30 Jun 2022 and again on 27 Dec 2022, the date of the FVS visit.

It was immediately put under quarantine.

The following strains of FMDV serotype O strains are known to have been circulating in the Middle East during recent years:
1. ME-SA/PanAsia-2/ANT10 (Turkey 2021; Jordan 2021; PA-WB 2021-2, Israel 2022)
2. ME-SA/PanAsia-2/QOM15 (Turkey 2019, 2021; PA 2019; Israel 2018-9, 2021)
3. ME-SA/Ind-2001 (Jordan 2017; Saudi Arabia 2018)
4. EA-3 (Libya 2019; Bahrain 2021; PA-WB 2017; PA-Gaza 2017, 2021; Israel 2017)

In early 2022, ME-SA/PanAsia-2/ANT10 was introduced from Jordan into the PA and Israel, spreading widely, causing 92 outbreaks throughout Israel, most of them in the north (WOAH map at https://wahis.woah.org/#/in-review/4305). The most recent outbreak, declared resolved in October 2022, occurred in Lehavot-Habashan, less than 10 km south west of the current outbreak (Buq'ata).

Genotyping of the pathogen will allow identifying its source. If caused by ME-SA/PanAsia-2/ANT10 strain, it may be the 93rd case of the 2022 event; otherwise, it may become the primary outbreak of a new, 2022/2023 FMD season, probably introduced from the adjacent Syrian territory, some 8 km distant.

The rate of protection rendered by the vaccines used in Israel during recent years became an issue of debate during the 2022 large outbreak. The vaccination policy has been consequently reviewed, assisted by post-vaccination follow-up serological trials comparing vaccines from 2 international producers. Eventually, it was concluded that animal challenge trials are conditional to obtain a reliable evaluation of vaccine efficacy. - Mod.AS]
