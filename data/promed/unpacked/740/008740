Between 3 Oct-13 Nov [2013], 36 cases of suspected yellow fever were recorded in West and South Kordofan; 10 people died.

At least 10 localities are affected by the disease. A small scale vaccination campaign began in the capital of South Kordofan, Kadugli, as well as in Elreef Alshargi, Lagawa and Keilak, targeting 100 000 people, the World Health Organisation (WHO) reports.

According to the WHO report, new cases were recorded in the localities of Talodi, Abu Gibaiha, Habila, Ghadir, Kadugli, Altadamon and Elreef Alshargi in the government-controlled areas of South Kordofan, and Lagawa, Kailak, and Almuglad in West Kordofan.

The Federal Minister of Health, Bahar Idris Abu Garda, reported that 20 cases of yellow fever have been confirmed in 3 South Kordofan localities. He said an investigation team has been sent to Abu Gibaiha locality.

[The yellow fever outbreak in West and South Kordofan continues to grow, with the number of deaths increasing from 7 to 10 and suspected cases from 22 to 36 in the past 48 hours. However, there is no indication in this report and the previous one of 16 Nov 2013 that these suspected cases have been laboratory confirmed. It is good to learn that surveillance and reporting has been strengthened, but it is urgent that the vaccination campaign be initiated as soon as possible. The area has many migrant agricultural laborers, and there is a risk that this mobile population may spread the virus to new localities.
