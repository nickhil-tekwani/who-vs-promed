[Several strains of Bluetongue virus circulate in the Mediterranean
Basin, so it will be interesting to see which one has infected
Morocco for the 1st time. An interesting anomaly, however, is
provided by Prof. Manlio Fadda's excellent comments on the
circulation of Bluetongue. (Bluetongue, sheep - Spain (Balearic
Islands): OIE 20031029.2692) references a map which shows Morocco
infected with BT 10, while neighboring Algeria and Tunisia are
infected with BT 2.
