A Tenino dairy's raw milk products are being recalled because they may
be contaminated with bacteria that can cause severe intestinal
distress. The Cozy Vale Creamery's whole and skim milk and cream are
distributed through 7 retail outlets in Pierce, Thurston and King
counties [in the state of Washington].

The products being recalled all have sell-by dates of 6 Dec 2011 or
earlier. The company advised buyers to return the suspect milk
products to the retailer where they bought it for a refund. The recall
was begun after Washington State Department of Agriculture
environmental swabbing at the facility discovered that locations in
the milking parlor and processing areas were contaminated with
toxin-producing _E. coli_ [O157] bacteria. Cozy Vale and Agriculture
Department officials are continuing their investigation into the
source of the problem. 3 illnesses have been reported in Cozy milk
customers since August 2011.

Recalled raw milk products were sold from the on-farm store at 7018
Churchill Road in Tenino and from the following locations:
Marlene's Market, 2951 S. 38th St., Tacoma; Olympia Food Co-op, 3111
Pacific Ave., Olympia; Olympia Food Co-op, 921 Rogers, Olympia;
Olympia Local Foods, 2442 Mottman Road S.W., Tumwater; Yelm Co-op, 404
1st St., Yelm; Mt. Community Co-op, 105 Carter St., Eatonville, and
Marlene's Market, 2565 S. Gateway Center Place, Federal Way.

[The following is extracted from the 8 Nov 2007 ProMED-mail post of a
CDC reported outbreak related to unpasteurized dairy products with the
references renumbered:

"Raw milk is a well-documented source of infections from _Salmonella_,
_E. coli_ O157:H7, _Campylobacter_, _Listeria_, _Mycobacterium bovis_,
and other pathogens (1-5). In 1938, before widespread adoption of milk
pasteurization in the USA, an estimated 25 percent of all foodborne
and waterborne outbreaks of disease were associated with milk (6). By
2001, the percentage of such outbreaks associated with milk was
estimated at less than one percent (6). During 1998-2005, a total of
45 outbreaks of foodborne illness were reported to CDC in which
unpasteurized milk (or cheese suspected to have been made from
unpasteurized milk) was implicated. These outbreaks accounted for 1007
illnesses, 104 hospitalizations, and 2 deaths (CDC, unpublished data,
2007). Because not all cases of foodborne illness are recognized and
reported, the actual number of illnesses associated with unpasteurized
milk likely is greater.

"Consumers have reported consuming raw milk for convenience, taste
preference, or perceived health benefits. Although some advocates
claim health benefits from raw milk compared with pasteurized milk,
including decreased risks for atherosclerosis, arthritis, and lactose
intolerance, such claims are not supported by scientific evidence (7).
Unsubstantiated claims of health benefits of raw milk for infants and
children are particularly concerning for care givers, because infants
and children are dependent on their care givers to make safe dietary
decisions for them. 16 of the 29 ill persons in this outbreak were
aged less than 7 years.

"Pathogens that infect humans are shed in the feces of cows, can be
present in or on the udders of cows, and can contaminate their milk.
Standard hygiene practices during milking can reduce but not eliminate
the risk for milk contamination. In a 2001-2002 survey of Pennsylvania
dairy farms, pathogenic bacteria, including _Salmonella_, were
isolated from 13 percent of samples from raw milk bulk tanks (8).
Pasteurization decreases the number of pathogenic organisms, prevents
transmission of pathogens, and has been determined to improve the
safety of milk more than other measures, including certification of
raw milk (3,4).

"As of 2004, at least 27 states permitted some form of raw milk sales
to the public, including sales at dairies, farmers' markets, or
through purchase of "cow shares." Certain states also allow public
sales of raw milk but for pet food only (9).

"Given the continued interest in raw milk production, policy makers,
parents, and the public need to be informed regarding the potential
health risks posed by raw-milk consumption. The only sure way for
consumers to prevent raw milk-associated infection from _Salmonella_
or other pathogens is to refrain from consuming raw milk.
