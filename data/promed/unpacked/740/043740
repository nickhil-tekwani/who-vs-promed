[According to Germany's Friedrich-Loeffler Institute, this is the 1st case of HPAI H5N6 in domestic poultry. At the beginning of the year [2018], a case was found in a wild bird in Bavaria.

The risk situation for avian influenza continues to change. Since the beginning of the year [2018], there have been a number of HPAI H5N6 detections in wild birds and domestic poultry, especially in northern Europe. Countries which have reported cases are the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, Bulgaria, Denmark and Ireland.

Previous studies have shown that the HPAI H5N6 reported in these cases is not the zoonotic H5N6 strain circulating in Asia. The complete article is available in German at https://www.fli.de/de/aktuelles/tierseuchengeschehen/aviaere-influenza-ai-gefluegelpest/.

The current H5N6 strain circulating in Europe is a reassortant between the highly pathogenic H5N8 virus and a low pathogenicity H5N6 virus. - Mod.CRD
