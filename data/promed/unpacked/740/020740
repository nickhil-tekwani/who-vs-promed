In response to the Moderator's comments about the Australian Government
making JE vaccine available to all Australian children, the government has
not done so.  Rather it has created a funding mechanism by which
vaccination can be funded for children for whom vaccination has been
determined to be necessary.  At this point in time, only children living on
the outer islands of the Torres Strait will be vaccinated.

As far as I know, the routine JE vaccine is only offered to children in the
Torres Strait community, not to all Australian children. Please refer to
the following news script:
CANBERRA, Nov 10 AAP - The federal government was moving swiftly to ensure
children in the Torres Strait would be routinely vaccinated against
Japanese encephalitis (JE), federal health minister Dr Michael Wooldridge
said today. Opening a communicable diseases conference here, Dr Wooldridge
announced the JE vaccine would be added to the standard Australian
vaccination schedule. Four of Australia's five cases of JE occurred in the
islands and one was acquired on the mainland earlier this year. Dr
Wooldridge said the commonwealth's decision to fund vaccination provided a
mechanism to act quickly if JE became established in other areas of
Australia.

The Australian Minister for Health recently announced that the Commonwealth
would fund JE vaccination for children in communities considered to be
at-risk of JE by the relevant State or Territory public health authorities.
At the moment, the only communities considered to be at an on-going risk of
JE are those in the outer islands of the Torres Strait (see map Med J Aust
1996, 165:257).
A mass JE vaccination campaign took place in the outer islands in late
1995/early 1996. In that campaign 88% of the ~3500 residents received three
doses of JE vaccine (Comm Dis Intell 1996, 20:188-190). Since then, JE
vaccine has been integrated into the routine childhood immunisation
schedule in the outer islands, with the first dose being given with MMR at
12 months of age, the second a week later with the third (and final) dose
of Hib vaccine (PRP-OMP) and the third at 13 months of age. A booster dose
of JE vaccine was recently given to all those in the outer islands who
received their initial series in 1995/96. This dose was given therefore
about three years after the primary series, in anticipation of the 1998/99
wet season (which has just begun). About 2,000 doses were administered; no
concerning adverse reactions were reported.
Apart from in the outer islands of the Torres Strait, JE vaccine is
occasionally administered to Australians heading off to JE endemic
countries abroad.
In summary, JE vaccine is not being administered to Australians other than
those in the remote outer islands of the Torres Strait, and [to the
occasional traveller.

[We are greatly appreciative of these informative and definitive replies.
My original comments were based on a message we had received from
Australia, citing, but not quoting, a newspaper report. Obviously that
citation was a misread of the intent. It is clear that the new Australian
Government is halting the apparent decline in childhood vaccination rates
there. One last question: Is dengue endemic on the Torres Strait islands?
