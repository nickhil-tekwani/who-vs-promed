An elderly Bristol County man has been hospitalized with eastern
equine encephalitis (EEE), the 1st human case reported in
Massachusetts this year [2011], state health authorities announced
this afternoon [2 Sep 2011].

The man, who lives in Raynham, became ill on Saturday [27 Aug 2011?]
and was taken to the hospital Monday, officials said.

Also called EEE, the virus is spread to humans through the bite of an
infected mosquito, and disease trackers recently issued health alerts
for several towns in Bristol and Plymouth counties about the increased
numbers of EEE-positive mosquitoes, which typically bite humans.

"EEE is devastating in all age groups, but especially in the elderly
and very young," said Dr. Alfred DeMaria, the state's top disease
tracker.

DeMaria said the man, whose identity has not been released, "is doing
very poorly."

He said 40 to 50 percent of EEE infections are fatal, "and about 80
percent of people who survive have significant neurological problems.
Southeastern Massachusetts is an area that concerns us every year," he
added.

Joseph Pacheco, chair of Raynham's Board of Selectmen and Board of
Health, said town officials received a call from the state this
afternoon [2 Sep 2011] alerting them that an elderly male resident had
been infected. He said state officials did not identify the resident.

"Every year, we have asked the state to do aerial spraying, and they
have been resistant to that," Pacheco said. "Again this year [2011],
we asked for aerial spraying, and that hasn't been done yet, but I
hope that now it will be done."

State officials did conduct aerial spraying across a broad swath of
Southeastern Massachusetts, including Raynham, last year [2010] in
August after unusually high levels of EEE were detected in the
mosquito population.

Pacheco said Bristol County authorities did conduct ground-based
spraying of several areas in Raynham last night [1 Sep 2011].

There was one case of EEE in a Massachusetts resident in 2010, as well
as in a Rhode Island resident who was probably exposed to the virus in
Massachusetts, officials said.

Mosquitoes will be biting and potentially transmitting more infections
until the 1st frost, officials said.

"It doesn't capture a lot of attention until and unless there is a
tragic situation like this that gets peoples' attention, especially
with this long weekend," said DeMaria.

He said health officials are especially concerned because many people
in southeastern Massachusetts, which was hard hit by last weekend's
tropical storm Irene, will be out cleaning up their yards and
neighborhoods from the damage.

"We are very worried that people get distracted with school and work,
and other things, and you sort of think mosquitoes aren't around
anymore," DeMaria said.

Residents can take several steps to protect themselves. Among those
steps: consider rescheduling outdoor activities to times when
mosquitoes are less likely to be biting. Peak danger times are between
dusk and dawn. Wearing long-sleeves, long pants, and socks when
outdoors will help keep mosquitoes away from your skin. Apply insect
repellent when outdoors.

disease, can be found on the state Department of Public Health's

[Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is transmitted to humans by
the bite of an infected mosquito. Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is
a rare illness in humans, and only a few cases are reported in the
United States each year. Most cases occur in the Atlantic and Gulf
Coast states. Most persons infected with EEEV have no apparent
illness. Severe cases of EEE (involving encephalitis, an inflammation
of the brain) begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever,
chills, and vomiting. The illness may then progress into
disorientation, seizures, or coma. EEE is one of the most severe
mosquito-transmitted diseases in the United States, with approximately
33 percent mortality and significant brain damage in most survivors.
There is no specific treatment for EEE; care is based on symptoms. You
can reduce your risk of being infected with EEEV by using insect
repellent (usually containing DEET), wearing protective clothing,
generally long sleeves and long pants, and clothing that is not dark
colored, and staying indoors while mosquitoes are most active (dusk
and dawn). If you think you or a family member may have EEE, it is
important to consult your healthcare provider for proper diagnosis.

The incubation period for eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV)
disease ranges from 4 to 10 days. EEEV infection can result in one of
2 types of illness, systemic or encephalitic (involving swelling of
the brain, referred to below as EEE). The type of illness will depend
on the age of the person and other host factors. It is possible that
some people who become infected with EEEV may be asymptomatic.

Systemic infection has an abrupt onset and is characterized by chills,
fever, malaise, arthralgia, and myalgia. The illness lasts 1-2 weeks,
and recovery is complete when there is no central nervous system
involvement. In infants, the encephalitic form is characterized by
abrupt onset; in older children and adults, encephalitis is manifested
after a few days of systemic illness. Signs and symptoms in
encephalitic patients are fever, headache, irritability, restlessness,
drowsiness, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, cyanosis, convulsions, and
coma.

Approximately 1/3rd of all people with EEE die from the disease. Death
usually occurs 2 to 10 days after onset of symptoms but can occur much
later. Of those who recover, many are left with disabling and
progressive mental and physical sequelae, which can range from minimal
brain dysfunction to severe intellectual impairment, personality
disorders, seizures, paralysis, and cranial nerve dysfunction. Many
patients with severe sequelae die within a few years.

No human vaccine against EEEV infection or specific antiviral
treatment for clinical EEEV infections is available. Patients with
suspected EEE should be evaluated by a healthcare provider,
appropriate serologic and other diagnostic tests ordered, and
supportive treatment provided.

The decision to exercise vector control is not an easy decision, and
ProMED-mail post 20110818.2504 shows some of the complications
involved in those decisions and the communications that are
necessary.

Hopefully, those hurdles have been cleared and communications have
occurred. While acknowledging that the decision and communication may
be difficult, it is nevertheless disturbing to realize that vector
control may have prevented the illness from with this fellow is
suffering.
