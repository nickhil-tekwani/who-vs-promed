on-line as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-1243A. Accepted for publication 5 Jul

So far, only 3 viral diseases have been identified in onion crops
grown in Spain. These are Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), Onion
yellow dwarf virus (OYDV), and Leek yellow stripe virus (LYSV). In
September 2003, unusual virus-like symptoms, including straw-colored,
dry, tan, diamond-shaped lesions on the leaves and stalks, sometimes
with necrotic lesions, curled leaves, and bulbs of reduced size, were
observed on several onion plants (_Allium cepa_ L.) in commercial
fields in Albacete, Spain. Severely affected plants eventually died.
To verify the identity of the disease found in the Spanish onions,
double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(DAS-ELISA) was performed on leaf extracts of symptomatic onions
using specific polyclonal antibodies against OYDV, LYSV, Cucumber
mosaic virus (CMV) (Biorad Phyto-Diagnostics, Marnes-La Coquette,
France), Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV), and TSWV (Loewe Biochemica,
Sauerlach, Germany). All samples of infected onion tissue were
positive for IYSV and negative for the other viruses tested.
To confirm the ELISA results, viral RNA was extracted from 5 of the
ELISA-positive onion samples, a healthy onion plant, and a positive
control for IYSV (DSMZ, Braunschweig. Germany). The extracted RNA was
used in a One-Step reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) assay using SuperScript Platinum Taq (Invitrogen Life
Technologies, Barcelona, Spain) in the presence of the IYSV1S and
IYSV1A primers for the nucleocapsid gene of IYSV (1). The RT-PCR
assay produced an amplicon of the expected size of 790 bp. No
amplification products were observed when healthy plants or a water
control were used as templates in the RT-PCR reaction.
To establish the authenticity of the virus from onion, the PCR
products were purified (High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit, Roche
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), sequenced, and the nucleotide
sequences obtained were analyzed and compared with the published
sequences in GenBank. The PCR product was 97 percent identical to the
sequence of the IYSV nucleocapsid gene (Genbank Accession No.
AB121026).
IYSV, an emerging tospovirus that is potentially a devastating
pathogen of onion, has been reported in many locations in Brazil,
Japan, the Netherlands, Israel, Australia, the western United States,
Slovenia, and Iran (2). IYSV is included in the European and
Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization alert list of viruses
(2), and to our knowledge, this is the 1st report of IYSV in Spain.
This tospovirus is transmitted in a propagative manner by _Thrips
tabaci_. Although the vector is present in large populations in the
onion-growing areas in Spain, the efficiency of the Mediterranean
ecotype in transmitting IYSV is not known.

[IYSV has been reported from North America for several years and
recently in Australia. The virus is mainly transmitted by onion
thrips (_Thrips tabaci_) and to some extent by the western flower
thrips (_Frankliniella occidentalis_), which causes considerably more
damage to the crop. Onion seed, bulbs, and roots are not known to
carry the virus, but volunteer onions are often symptomatic in early
spring in Colorado. The virus likely over-winters in perennial and
winter annual weeds, over-wintering onion, and adult thrips.
To my knowledge, there is no biological control for IYSV. Disease management
depends upon use of thrips-free transplants, utilization of crop rotation (at
least 3 years between crops), elimination of culls and weed hosts of the
vector, and avoidance of plant stress by providing appropriate irrigation, and
avoidance of soil compaction and saline soils. There are no completely
IYSV-resistant onion cultivars available, but there are some less resistant
ones that can be used. Thrips control may provide some reduction in Iris
yellow spot, but thrips control alone is not sufficient to economically
control the disease. Thrips resistance to commonly applied insecticides is
widespread in Colorado and other onion production regions of the High Plains
in the USA.
