Hundreds of dogs have fallen to a mystery illness after taking walks on beaches along the Yorkshire coast.

Veterinary nurse Brogan Proud issued a warning to dog owners to avoid the beach on Monday [10 Jan 2022], after noticing a "high increase" of dogs coming into veterinary practices with severe vomiting and diarrhoea.

One was Copper, a 9-month-old beagle spaniel, who began vomiting on Monday [10 Jan 2022] after enjoying a walk on Fraisthorpe beach in East Riding, Yorkshire, on Sunday [9 Jan 2022]. His owner, from Tadcaster, said she took him to the vet on Tuesday [11 Jan 2022] after she became increasingly worried about him. "They gave him an antisickness jab, which has helped. But it's just coming out the other end now," she said.

About 2 weeks ago, Proud and her colleagues began treating dogs having been walked on beaches including Scarborough, Robin Hood's Bay, Whitby, and Marske-by-the-sea. She issued an alert on Facebook on Monday [10 Jan 2022], which has attracted more than 1000 responses, with several dog owners sharing similar stories from inland areas and further down the coast in east Yorkshire.

The post "blew up", leading Proud to fear "thousands" could have been affected by the mystery illness. Many responses were from those who had visited the coast in early January and had now returned home.

"Their dogs are then carrying the virus or the bacteria or the problem. And so it's no longer being kept on the coast as far as I can see, and it is spreading."

Although theories abound on social media, Proud said no vet, agency, or authority had been able to establish a cause or a common theme in behaviour, such as eating or chewing anything washed up on the beach or swimming in the sea. Whatever the cause, according to Proud, "if there's going to be something spread, dogs will spread it".

She added: "If it's a virus or a bacteria, it's going to be spread in their urine or faeces or in the shedding of their fur. And we all know how dogs like to meet and greet each other -- nose to nose, touching bums, and all sorts.

"My advice would be, if you've been on the beach, wash your dog in case it's carrying anything and be vigilant about your dog's behaviour."

AY and his French bulldog, Ada, from Carlisle, were on holiday in Robin Hood's Bay over the new year. The day after they returned on [4 Jan 2022], Ada had severe sickness and diarrhoea. After 2 trips to the vet, she is only just starting to keep food down again. "She's lost a considerable amount of weight, her harness barely fits."

Kirsty Salisbury, coastal general manager for East Riding council, said the inspections team had not noticed anything unusual on the beaches. "We have been liaising with external partners during the course of yesterday to try to establish a cause, while also liaising with local colleagues, and also nationally.

"From reports from local veterinary surgeries, the illness they are seeing within dogs and the tests carried out have not provided any direct links with the use of beaches."

Scarborough borough council also said while dogs walking on beaches have been affected, other dog owners are reporting the same signs from inland locations.

"If any vets have information about possible links to a canine virus that could help these investigations, we kindly ask them to contact our dog warden service."

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it was aware of the incidents and was in contact with the Animal and Plant Health Agency.

"We are not aware of any link with the issue of crustaceans washed ashore in the area late last year [2021]," Defra said.

Dozens of dogs have fallen ill with a mysterious illness which has been linked to beaches in Yorkshire.

Vets in the area say the dogs have suffered vomiting and diarrhoea after walking along the coast in recent weeks.

Yorkshire Coast Pet Care said it has been "inundated" with cases and advised owners to avoid the beaches until environmental health experts can figure out what is causing this illness.

[CB] said her working cocker spaniel Roo became ill the day after visiting Fraisthorpe Beach, near Bridlington, on 30 Dec 2021.

Roo spent 6 nights at the vet's after prolonged vomiting and diarrhoea led to dehydration, but she is now recovering at home.

"We just went into panic mode, thinking she'd eaten something and it had poisoned her," Ms CB said.

"I thought we might lose her because the vets couldn't tell us what was wrong and this diarrhoea just didn't stop.

"It (the beach) is my favourite place to go and it's my dog's favourite place to go, but I don't know if I'll dare go again."

Veterinary nurse Brogan Proud said she works at practices across North Yorkshire and she has seen "tonnes" of dogs suffering from this mysterious illness.

She said: "I'm personally not taking my dog on the beach for the next couple of weeks and if your dog shows any signs of vomiting or diarrhoea I would get onto the vet straight away.

"The sooner that they've had this injection that helps them stop vomiting, the sooner they can start getting better."

She added: "None of the ones I've dealt with or heard of firsthand have died.

"With an anti-sickness injection, something to settle the stomach and help with the diarrhoea, and a rest at home, they tend to pick up within the week."

She is urging owners to alert their local council if their dog falls ill after walking on the beach.

An investigation was launched in October [2021], after dead crabs, lobsters, and fish washed up along the North East coast. Thousands were found on beaches in Hartlepool, Redcar, Saltburn, Staithes, and Whitby in October, but the Environment Agency said they were not killed by pollution.

Dog owners have been warned to keep their dogs off beaches after a number of pets have fallen ill after a seaside stroll. Dog owners issued an urgent warning as pets fall ill with vomiting and diarrhoea after walking on the beach.

Veterinary nurse Brogan Proud said practices across the North East coast have been "inundated" with calls from concerned locals about their poorly pets.

But owners have been left baffled by their pooches' sudden signs as the cause of their sickness has not yet been established.

The veterinary nurse, who runs the mobile Yorkshire Coast Pet Care which visits several practices, advised people to keep their beloved dogs away from the sands for the time being.

Brogan explained reports of vomiting and diarrhea have been an ongoing problem, but numbers have skyrocketed in recent weeks.

Despite reassuring owners, she is unaware of any dog's dying after contracting the mystery illness, the vet recommended calling off coastal walks for the meantime.

She told Teesside Live: "I work within several practices up and down the North East coast and we have recently been inundated with dogs coming off the beaches with vomiting and diarrhoea.

"Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any correlation other than contact with the beach."

She advised pet owners to make sure their furry friends don't eat anything on the beach to keep them fit and well.

Brogan also suggested washing them off thoroughly if they have wandered on the sands in case the cause of the ailment is a toxin or something similar.

"Personally, until the local authorities have got to the bottom of it I would not recommend taking your pets on the beach for the foreseeable future," she said.

"I have been in touch with governing bodies and they are currently looking into it.

"If your dog is showing signs please make the local authorities aware as well as seeking veterinary attention should your pet need it."

The animal expert also said dogs and birds could spread the unusual illness via their faeces. [While this is possible, I wonder if they know this for a fact since the cause is unknown, or if this is standard of care for situations like this? - Mod.TG]

Brogan continued: "I wouldn't be surprised to see pets catching this just being near the beach, the lines, or cliffs, etc., it's hard to avoid all these places.

"It's more about being careful and vigilant with your pets.

"It's currently unknown what it is and what is causing it -- if it comes from the dogs eating stuff on the beaches or going into the water."

Several dog owners responded to Brogan's online warning, echoing her concerns while telling the tales of their sick pets.

One wrote: "My 11-month and 4-month [-old dogs] have both had this. Not the vomiting though, just the diarrhoea. They have been to Seaton within the last week."

Another added: "We had a GB 100 [about USD 137] vets bill following a trip to the blue lagoon on New Year's Day and he's still not right. "Signs were as described on here so hope they get to the bottom of it fast."

While a 3rd chimed in: "My doggy had this last week. 2 days he was lethargic, he was sick once and had diarrhoea. "I phoned the out-of-hours vets as was worried and they said there is a lot of bugs going around at the moment. "He is back to his normal self after 48 hours. I just kept him hydrated with syringe and water and is now back to causing mischief," he said.

[Indeed, this is somewhat mysterious. At first, it seems the cases were associated with walking on the beach but then other and more inland cases have come to light.

Furthermore, the possible connection to the crustacean die off does not seem to be linked to the mysterious illness in the dogs, especially as some the dogs are having the same clinical signs but have not been to the beach.

My 1st thought was red tide. However, it seems a strange time of year for such an event, although there are cool water algae. While this may seem a reasonable place to start, the inland cases seem to put an end to the beach-associated illness.

The most consistent and frequently mentioned signs are diarrhea and dehydration and secondarily vomiting. Of course, with severe diarrhea and/or vomiting, dehydration can become serious. With these 2 issues being the most prominent signs, one wonders what are these dogs tasting or ingesting? Is there a common food?

I would be curious to know if there have been any fecal cultures and/or blood cultures done on the affected animals. It almost seems like it is enteric-associated. I don't know if any food investigations would reveal anything, but it is possible. Are there any overlaps in food and the company producing the food? By this I mean most large food manufacturers have several lines of pet food. Certain ingredients may be common to 2 of the lines but not to the 3rd line of production, for example. Has any blood work been done? Is there any pattern here?

While a suggested diagnosis does not readily spring to mind, there are many avenues to investigate.

We look forward to learning the outcome of the investigation and the cause of this canine dilemma. - Mod.TG
