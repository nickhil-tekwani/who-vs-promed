Breakthrough in sunflower disease identification
------------------------------------------------
Researchers have identified a disease that has been damaging sunflower
crops in Queensland's central highlands for up to 4 years. It is the 1st
time the tobacco streak virus has been found on sunflowers in Australia. It
causes black streaks on the plants and stunts their growth and has affected
crop yields in the Emerald area.
Richard Routley from the Department of Primary Industries says they are now
trying to overcome the problem. "1st time it's been isolated in sunflowers
in Australia as far as we know, certainly in other countries it's been
isolated in sunflowers and causing us problems," he said. "But it's likely
that the virus has been, well, it is throughout Queensland, and it's likely
that it's been in central Queensland in the past, but what we're not sure
of is why it's shown up in sunflowers all of a sudden."

[The oil crop plant sunflower, _Helianthus annuus_, develops symptoms of
necrosis when infected by tobacco streak virus (TSV, family: Bromoviridae,
genus: Ilarvirus).
The virus TSV has a worldwide distribution including Australia. It is often
associated with viral diseases in crops such as tobacco, soybeans, beans,
peanut, strawberry and asparagus. This is the 1st report in sunflower in
Australia. It is associated with necrosis of sunflower in India. The
natural vector is thrips (3 thrips species, _Megalurothrips usitatus_,
_Frankliniella schultzei_ and _Scirtothrips dorsalis_, were vectors in the
presence of infected pollen in India). Seed/pollen transmission is a
characteristic property of the virus.
