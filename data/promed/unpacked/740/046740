Portugal has 5 confirmed cases of monkeypox, the Directorate-General for Health (DGS) said in a statement, noting that the country has more than 20 suspected cases of the virus. "This May [2022], more than 20 suspected cases of infection with the monkeypox virus were identified, all in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley region, 5 of which have already been confirmed by the National Institute of Health on 18 [May 2022]. The cases, mostly young, and all male, are stable, presenting ulcerative lesions", says the statement from the DGS.

The statement also indicates that the DGS centralizes "at this stage, all actions of detection, assessment, management, and risk communication related to these cases, through the Center for Public Health Emergencies (CESP)".

The monkeypox virus is in the _Orthopoxvirus_ genus and causes a communicable disease through contact with animals or close contact with infected people or contaminated materials, explains the DGS.

"The disease is rare and, usually does not spread easily among humans," the statement from the health authority clarifies. "Individuals who present ulcerative lesions, skin rash, palpable lymph nodes, possibly accompanied by fever, chills, headaches, muscle pain, and tiredness, should seek clinical advice. In case of suspicious symptoms, the individual should refrain from direct physical contact [with other people]," the statement from the DGS adds which also indicates that the disease does not require specific treatment and is "usually self-limited in weeks."

"The United Kingdom has reported similar cases of ulcerative lesions, with confirmation of monkeypox virus infection. The DGS is monitoring the situation at the national level and in conjunction with European institutions," concludes the statement sent by the health authority to the media. This rare relative of smallpox was detected in the UK on [7 May 2022], diagnosed in a person who reportedly contracted the infection after a trip to Nigeria.

[Interestingly, the diagnosis of monkeypox as the West African clade was confirmed by PCR in the UK on 6 May 2022 (https://www.thecable.ng/ncdc-15-monkeypox-cases-confirmed-in-2022). This is an important finding because the West African clade is less pathogenic than the Central African clade, with little or no mortality. - Mod.TY]

- 1st signs of global outbreak of rare disease as Portugal, UK, Spain, all find cases
- Experts fear disease is spreading in communities for 1st time, going undetected
- US health officials are monitoring 6 Americans who were in contact with case

Monkeypox has now been spotted in Portugal and Spain, in what could be the first global outbreak of the rare disease.

Spain is monitoring 8 men who it believes are infected, with tests being carried out to confirm they have the virus. All of the men are gay or bisexual, according to local media, and most were detected at STI [sexually transmitted infection] clinics in Madrid.

In Portugal, 5 men have also tested positive and at least 15 more cases are being investigated, health officials there said today. These cases are all male and mostly 'young' -- but it is not yet clear how they caught the virus.

Until now, monkeypox cases were confined to travellers and their relatives returning from western and central Africa, where the virus is endemic. But experts now fear it is spreading more widely for the 1st time after 7 Britons were diagnosed in the past fortnight. In the UK, 6 of them appear to have been infected and the majority are not linked, which suggests more cases are going undetected. Health chiefs are scrambling to find the source of the cases.

Of the British patients, 4 are gay or bisexual men, and officials say the pattern of transmission is 'highly suggestive of spread in sexual networks'.

Regions across Spain have been put on alert following the announcement of 8 suspected cases in Madrid. Confirmation is still awaited from the National Centre for Microbiology but health chiefs say 'great care must be taken.' The country's top public health doctor, Fernando Simón, said 'it is not likely that monkeypox will generate a significant transmission but it cannot be ruled out'. The Spanish health alert system has called on communities to notify public health services 'urgently' of patients with symptoms. He said it was now necessary to take extreme surveillance measures and investigate all the hypotheses about the routes of contagion.

Meanwhile, the suspected cases in Portugal were all detected in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley region. The men are said to be 'stable' and all suffering from 'ulcerative lesions', one of the tell-tale signs of the virus. Portugal's health ministry has issued a warning urging people with lesions and rashes to see a doctor. When these symptoms appear, 'direct physical contact' should be avoided, officials added.

Until now monkeypox had only ever been detected in 4 countries outside of Africa -- the UK, US, Israel, and Singapore. All of the cases had travel links back to Nigeria and Ghana. Infections are more common in central and western Africa, where they can result from direct contact with infected animals.

An expert from the UK Health Security Agency said the latest UK cases 'appear to have acquired the infection via sexual contact'. Dr Mateo Prochazka, who leads the UKHSA team which is investigating monkeypox, described this route of transmission as 'novel'. In England, 7 people have been diagnosed with the virus over the past 2 weeks, 5 of which are in London. Of these, 4 are gay or bisexual men, and only one has recent travel links to a country where the virus is endemic, which is 'highly suggestive' of spread in 'sexual networks', Dr Prochazka added.

Writing on Twitter, he said: '... the high proportion of cases in the current outbreak in England that are gay or bisexual (4/7, 57%) is highly suggestive of spread in sexual networks. This is further suggested by the fact that common contacts have been identified for only 2 of the 4 latest cases.' Other experts said further research is necessary before it will be possible to conclude if the virus is sexually transmissible.

Monkeypox can kill up to one in 10 people who get it but the new cases have the West African variant, which is deadly for around one in 100. Initial symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitals. The rash changes and goes through different stages, and can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.

UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) bosses have now written to regional NHS teams telling them to stock up on PPE and be on alert for patients with a new rash.

UK health chiefs say the risk to the UK population is low. But they have urged gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men to be extra vigilant because they appear to be at higher risk of catching it. These groups have been urged to look out for any unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, and to contact a sexual health service without delay if they have concerns.

Most scientists believe the outbreak will be small and transmission nothing like the levels seen with COVID. This is because monkeypox is poor at spreading between humans and relies on very close and prolonged contact between people.

[The monkeypox (MPX) outbreaks in Spain, Portugal, and the UK are highly unusual. Most of the infected individuals had not traveled to MPX virus endemic countries so their infections must have been acquired locally. Although cases of person-to-person transmission have been reported, particularly among healthcare workers attending MPX cases, chains of transmission occurring simultaneously in 3 different locations is novel. Sexual transmission has not been suspected before. As the reports above indicate, transmission through sexual intercourse has not been proven in these cases and other behaviors involving close physical contact may have been involved. It will be interesting to learn if additional cases are confirmed in any of the 3 countries in the coming days. - Mod.TY
