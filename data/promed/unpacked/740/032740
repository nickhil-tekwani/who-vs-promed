[1] Case update
- Thu 27 Aug 2020. 2 additional cases reported
[Outbreak News Today, edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/ebola-outbreak-two-additional-cases-reported-16139/

The World Health Organization (WHO) Africa Region reported 2 additional ebolavirus disease (EVD) cases in Equateur Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This brings the outbreak total to 104 (100 confirmed and 4 probable). The death toll remains at 44.

The number of health areas that have reported at least one confirmed or probable case of EVD since the start of this outbreak has risen to 34, in 11 of the 18 health zones in the province.

WHO says the 11th EVD outbreak in DRC continues to be of grave concern, with a continuing increase in incidence and more health areas and health zones affected. Challenges continue around known confirmed cases still living in the community and contacts lost to follow-up, as well as an ongoing strike among personnel in response pillars. Also, there is a lack of funding for the response, particularly that required to prevent further spread, and inadequate human resources for risk communication and engagement in affected health zones and hotspots.

In both EVD and COVID-19, there is a need to sustain a strong and robust surveillance system in order to detect, isolate, test and treat new suspected cases as early as possible, to improve outcomes in potential cases, and to break all chains of transmission.

[The number of cases is continuing to increase by 1 or 2 nearly every day. Apparently very little attention is being paid to EVD, and this steady but slow increase in cases, likely because of the low numbers, puts the country in jeopardy of witnessing an explosion of cases. Data appear in tweets and summaries in CIDRAP. Oddly, the number of probable cases remained suspiciously at 4 from 20 Jul 2020, when there were 53 total cases, to 27 Aug 2020, when 104 cases were reported, but now the probable case number has just jumped to 6 (106 cases -- see below). There is no easily accessible dashboard being made public to follow cases in each of the health zones affected, or the numbers of vaccinations being administered. This makes one wonder how seriously this outbreak is being taken. - Mod.LK]

Tests confirmed 2 more Ebola infections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) outbreak in Equateur Province, lifting the overall total to 106, WHO's African regional office said in a Twitter update today [27 Aug 2020]. Two more deaths were reported, putting the outbreak's fatality count at 46.

The latest outbreak in the DRC began in early June [2020], just as a large outbreak centered in North Kivu province was declared over. Genetic evidence suggests the 2 outbreaks aren't related, with the new one thought to be the result of a new zoonotic spillover where a similar, short-lived outbreak occurred in 2018.

Illnesses in the new outbreak, the DRC's 11th involving Ebola, are occurring across a wide area that ranges from remote areas that are hard for responders to reach to the provincial capital Mbandaka, which is located on a river and has travel connections to Kinshasa and neighboring countries.

[2] Outbreak summary
- Thu 27 Aug 2020. Ebola in DRC -- an update
[Outbreak Observatory, edited]
https://tinyurl.com/yxql569d
[byline: Lucia Mullen]

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) announced its most recent outbreak of Ebolavirus disease (EVD) on 1 Jun 2020, in the Equateur Province. Outbreak Observatory reported on the outbreak shortly after it was originally announced, as well as a brief update in July [2020]; however, almost 3 months into the outbreak, the response struggles to get ahead of the threat. While responders have leveraged key lessons and operational capacity from previous responses, limited resources, largely stemming from the simultaneous COVID-19 response, have added to the complexity of the ongoing response. This week, Outbreak Observatory will provide an update on the country's response to EVD in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as a myriad of other disease threats.

Current situation: DRC is no stranger to EVD outbreaks, and the ongoing response is the 11th in its history. The outbreak began while the country was still battling the second largest EVD outbreak on record. That outbreak originated in North Kivu in August 2018 and lasted nearly 2 years, ultimately resulting in more than 34 000 cases and nearly 2300 deaths by the time it was declared over on 25 Jun 2020. The Equateur Province, where DRC's current EVD outbreak is ongoing, also faced an EVD outbreak in July 2018, which lasted less than 3 months and resulted in only 54 cases and 33 deaths. DRC's current EVD outbreak was identified at the beginning of June 2020, following the death of 4 family members in Mbandaka, the provincial capital of Equateur. Since then, the outbreak has grown rapidly and spread widely across the province to many remote and hard-to-reach areas. DRC has reported cases in 11 of Equateur's 17 health zones, and the total incidence has nearly doubled over the past 5 weeks. As of 22 Aug 2020, DRC reported 103 confirmed and probable cases in the region, including 44 deaths.

DRC'S response: The DRC national government is leading the response, using local expertise established and honed during responses to previous EVD outbreaks, including in Equateur in 2018 and North Kivu in 2018-2020. WHO and other partner organizations have also provided experts on the ground to support vital response activities, such as ring vaccination, health screenings and testing, contact tracing, sample collection, and community engagement. WHO has supported ring vaccination of more than 22 600 people identified as high risk and screened more than 640 000 people across 40 travel checkpoints established between affected areas. Undoubtedly, the recent experience scaling up vaccination operations for the North Kivu response, which vaccinated more than 300 000 people, facilitated the rapid deployment and administration of vaccines in Equateur. DRC has also ensured that the outbreak response incorporates key lessons from previous responses, particularly regarding the importance of working with local community members. To that end, community health workers have conducted health and safety information, education, and awareness-raising efforts in support of the response, including about the response itself and EVD more broadly (e.g., symptoms, routes of transmission), to about 774 000 people in affected areas.

The response to this EVD outbreak was activated much more quickly than previous responses, in part due to the collective local experience available as well as the many responders and partner organizations who were already present due to the outbreak in North Kivu. Using local resources and personnel who were previously trained in EVD diagnostics, health officials in Equateur were able to rapidly collect and test samples from early suspected patients, which enabled them to declare the onset of the outbreak within 1 day of initiating testing. Also, ring vaccination efforts for the current outbreak began within 4 days of the outbreak being declared, compared with 2 weeks for the 2018 Equateur outbreak.

Challenges: Despite DRC's ability to quickly mount early response activities, including vaccination, the outbreak is proving to be complex and difficult to control. Almost 3 months into the current EVD outbreak, at 103 cases and 44 deaths [now 106 and 46, respectively], it is already larger than the 2018 Equateur outbreak, and it seems unlikely that DRC will bring an end to the current outbreak in the coming weeks. Many of the challenges facing the ongoing EVD response can be traced back to competing priorities, particularly as the country responds to COVID-19.

With EVD cases spread across remote areas in the region, the response has become costly, and health practitioners and supplies have struggled to reach all affected communities. In some areas, the outbreak has spread to remote communities, some more than 300 km (186 mi) apart from one another. Many of these hotspots are not readily accessible by roads, and it can take days for responders to reach some affected communities. We have heard anecdotal reports from some of our colleagues that this time delay is further strained due to the limited number of personnel available to perform EVD response activities. Many local practitioners and international organizations are busy with COVID-19 response efforts, leaving the few responders left in the field responsible for covering large geographical regions of the EVD outbreak. Responders struggle to identify and isolate all cases, and there is growing concern that the outbreak could spread to larger cities -- such as Kinshasa, with a population of more than 11 million people -- or across the border to neighboring countries. The risk of international spread is especially concerning, as other countries are focused on their own COVID-19 response. These healthcare and public health capacities are already under considerable strain, even without the additional burden of combating a regional EVD epidemic.

Funding is often a major challenge for outbreak responses, but it is especially true now because donors and resources are focused on COVID-19 and other outbreaks in the DRC, including measles and cholera. The DRC government predicted the need for USD 40 million to implement its EVD response plan, but the current funding level is inadequate. WHO provided an initial USD 1.7 million, followed by an additional USD 600 000 from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies, and DRC committed USD 4 million of its own to support the response. Other partners and donors have announced varying levels of funding support, including a recent pledge of USD 7.5 million by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) for humanitarian assistance to contain EVD, but additional funds are needed in order to fully implement the response.

Historically, additional funding has been available through various international humanitarian aid organizations; however, the COVID-19 pandemic has driven major changes to some of their operations. Notably, some humanitarian organizations have announced plans to scale back operations due to financial limitations associated with the pandemic, and other essential health programs around the world are suffering because of limitations on available resources and restrictions in place due to COVID-19. Also, humanitarian aid from high-income countries decreased substantially in the first half of 2020 as countries focused on combating domestic COVID-19 epidemics. Regardless of the source, humanitarian aid may be more difficult to come by in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Challenges from previous EVD outbreaks -- including widespread community distrust, violence against healthcare workers, and an increasing number of displaced peoples and communities due to ongoing civil war and violence -- are also present in this outbreak. Much like the recent outbreak in North Kivu, these challenges make it difficult for responders to access affected communities to conduct response operations, including vaccination and contact tracing. These challenges are not specific to EVD response in DRC, and practitioners are facing similar challenges for response operations to COVID-19 and other disease outbreaks. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the UN's refugee agency, expressed concern earlier this year [2020], during the North Kivu outbreak, that the ongoing insecurity in the DRC and the increasing number of displaced persons could derail the country's attempts to fight COVID-19.

Conclusion: Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO regional director for Africa, noted that "responding to Ebola in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is complex, but we must not let COVID-19 distract us from tackling other pressing health threats." Unfortunately, the DRC is faced with not only simultaneously responding to EVD and COVID-19, but multiple other outbreaks at once, placing a severe strain on the country's public health and healthcare resources, including the critical importance of continuing to provide essential health services. In addition, as the world battles the COVID-19 pandemic, international donors and responding agencies must divide their attention between multiple major health threats, both domestic and global, which further limits the availability of funds, supplies, and personnel and places additional challenges on an already complex EVD response for DRC.

- Thu 27 Aug 2020. Antivirals
[Science, abridged, edited]
https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/08/26/science.abb3753.full


ref: Bruchez A, Sha K, Johnson J, et al. MHC class II transactivator CIITA induces cell resistance to Ebola virus and SARS-like coronaviruses. Science. Epub 27 Aug 2020. doi: 10.1126/science.abb3753

Abstract: Recent outbreaks of Ebola virus (EBOV) and SARS-CoV-2 have exposed our limited therapeutic options and poor understanding of cellular mechanisms that block viral infections. Using a transposon-mediated gene-activation screen in human cells, we identify that the MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) has antiviral activity against EBOV. CIITA induces resistance by activating expression of the p41 isoform of invariant chain CD74, which inhibits viral entry by blocking cathepsin-mediated processing of the Ebola glycoprotein (EboGP). We further show that CD74 p41 can block the endosomal entry pathway of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. These data therefore implicate CIITA and CD74 in host defense against a range of viruses and identify an additional function of these proteins beyond their canonical roles in antigen presentation.

Introduction: Recent and ongoing outbreaks of Ebola virus (EBOV) in Africa and the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlight the need to identify additional treatment strategies for viral infections, including approaches that might complement traditional antivirals. Of particular interest is the identification of host-directed therapies that target common vulnerabilities and may be potentially efficacious against multiple viruses, including those that may emerge in the future.

We set out to identify host pathways of cellular resistance to pathogens with pandemic potential, using a transposon-mutagenesis forward genetic approach.

- Thu 27 Aug 2020. Rapid diagnostic detects Lassa and Ebola in real time
[Medical Express, edited]
https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-08-rapid-diagnostic-lassa-ebola-real-time.html
[byline: Tom Ulrich]

One of the keys to bringing a viral outbreak under control is rapid detection and diagnosis, which depend on the availability of fast, low-cost, easy-to-use tests that don't require labs or expensive equipment to process them. Scientists at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and collaborators in the USA, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone have now validated such tests for Ebola and Lassa -- 2 of the deadliest and most transmissible human viruses -- in settings with limited infrastructure. The work appears in Nature Communications.

The diagnostic tests use the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK assay to detect low levels of virus in patient samples and generate either a fluorescent readout or a result on a paper strip. The test can be tailored to detect specific viruses from certain regions, requires only a simple heat block and basic supplies to run, costs less than USD 1 per sample, could be used on saliva or urine -- eliminating the need for blood draws -- and can return results in less than an hour.

The tests also use a rapid chemical and heat treatment called HUDSON to inactive the virus in patient samples. HUDSON makes the patient samples safer for clinical staff to handle in a low-tech environment and eliminates the need to extract a virus's genetic material from the samples before analyzing.

The research team was led at Broad by Kayla Barnes, an NIH Fogarty K fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health and Broad Institute, Anna Lachenauer, a medical student at Stanford University School of Medicine, and institute member Pardis Sabeti, a professor at Harvard University and investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

To showcase SHERLOCK's field utility, team members led by Christian Happi at Redeemer's University in Nigeria deployed a Lassa-specific assay during a recent Lassa fever outbreak -- the 1st use of SHERLOCK in a low/middle income country. The team also compared the diagnostic against a standard RT-qPCR assay for Lassa.

Collaborators at Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone and at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases benchmarked an Ebola-specific version of the SHERLOCK assay, using samples collected during the 2014-2016 outbreak in Sierra Leone and more recent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The NIH Integrated Research Facility also validated HUDSON's ability to heat-inactivate Ebola virus in their BL4 facilities, further establishing the safety and efficiency of this step.

The SHERLOCK assays performed as consistently as, or better than, other diagnostics in these validations -- demonstrating the platform's potential for clinical use in the future in resource-limited areas.

The team also developed a mobile phone app called HandLens, spearheaded by Andres Colubri, assistant professor in the Bioinformatics and Integrative Biology program at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, that can read and immediately report paper strip SHERLOCK results. The tool can aid in situations where the paper strip gives a faint signal that is challenging for a clinician to interpret. This app can be adapted for use on any smartphone or tablet, according to the researchers, allowing a clear, unbiased diagnostic readout.

Abstract: Recent outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs), including Ebola virus disease (EVD) and Lassa fever (LF), highlight the urgent need for sensitive, deployable tests to diagnose these devastating human diseases. Here we develop CRISPR-Cas13a-based (SHERLOCK) diagnostics targeting Ebola virus (EBOV) and Lassa virus (LASV), with both fluorescent and lateral flow readouts. We demonstrate on laboratory and clinical samples the sensitivity of these assays and the capacity of the SHERLOCK platform to handle virus-specific diagnostic challenges. We perform safety testing to demonstrate the efficacy of our HUDSON protocol in heat-inactivating VHF viruses before SHERLOCK testing, eliminating the need for an extraction. We develop a user-friendly protocol and mobile application (HandLens) to report results, facilitating SHERLOCK's use in endemic regions. Finally, we successfully deploy our tests in Sierra Leone and Nigeria in response to recent outbreaks.

Utilizing this system, we develop a diagnostic test for EBOV and LASV that can be deployed in any setting, requires minimal processing of infectious materials, and accurately reports test results in a user-friendly format....

This is an important assay because of the co-circulation of these 2 viruses, and although their ecology is completely different, there are similarities in symptoms between the 2 -- both hemorrhagic fever viruses with symptoms that include fever, headache, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue and vomiting. These symptoms tend to be more severe in Ebola cases. In severe cases, both diseases can cause bleeding from the gums, eyes and nose. Lassa, as opposed to Ebola, can also cause tremors, facial swelling, respiratory distress and encephalitis in serious cases. Lassa can also cause varying degrees of deafness in mild and severe cases -- often, the hearing loss is permanent. However, only about 20% of cases become severe, while 80% remain mild, meaning they're often undiagnosed. Symptoms of infection for the disease appear between 6 and 21 days and usually begin gradually.

With Ebola, symptoms generally appear between 8 and 10 days after infection but can surface between 2 and 21 days after infection. Having an assay available anywhere in remote settings will be a big boon to separating the 2 diseases. And since Ebola can be transmitted person to person, these patients can be immediately separated from others (some parts excerpted from http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/how-lassa-and-ebola-are-similar-different). - Mod.LK
