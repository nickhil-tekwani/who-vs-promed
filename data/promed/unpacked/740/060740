Pam Small's data are a pleasure to read. I wonder if they, or similar data
are published somewhere. The differences in ability of the genetic clusters
(_Shigella_ species) to persist in the environment are interesting, and
begin to clarify some of the questions about the relative prevalence of the
different clusters. I wonder if the same studies were done with all the
_S. flexneri_ serogroups and subgroups, and that such data might explain
the rather consistent differences in frequencies of _S. flexneri_ 3a, 4b,
etc..
Two further questions make me hesitant to put a great deal of weight on the
environmental data.
I wonder if the differences observed were differences in days rather than
hours. That seems important because secondary spread from _S.
dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_ and _S. sonnei_ are not necessarily events that
involve days, so it is important to know more about the data.
And Floyd's data in Cairo in the 1950's suggested that _S. sonnei_ was
there and not particularly uncommon. Perhaps the reason for its "absence"
was based on the generally mild character of the illness, especially when
compared to _S. dysenteriae_ and _S. flexneri_. Maybe the major changes
are with _S. dysenteriae_ and _S. flexneri_ rather than _S. sonnei_.
That was why I wondered if there were data comparing the infectious dose of
the different organisms, which might show that _S. sonnei_ had the smallest
infectious dose, so that when gross contamination was controlled, it
reduced the spread of the other two, but had less effect on _S. sonnei_.
