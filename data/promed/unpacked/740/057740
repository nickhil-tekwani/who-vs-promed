Two years after it was reported from the Diver area of Kupwara [district, Jammu and Kashmir state], hepatitis B continues to infect more and more people for want of health education and screening by authorities. Hepatitis B has been reported in a large number of people in Kakadpati (Diver) village of Lolab in North Kashmir's Kupwara district triggering panic in the area. Health authorities on [Mon 16 Nov 2015], confirmed that 59 patients had tested positive for hepatitis B in Kakadpati and Hajam Mohalla of Diver Lolab.

However, some health officials said that the number might be much more considering that only 2000 people had been screened out of the 9000 villagers of the area. Some months back, as per CMO [Chief Medical Officer] Kupwara, Dr Ghulam Nabi Lone, 90 samples were taken of which 8 tested positive for hepatitis B.

Director Health Services Kashmir, Dr Sumir Ji Mattoo downplayed the situation and said that there were no new cases. "All these are old cases. There's nothing new in this," he said. Asked whether any fresh screening of population had been carried out, he said, "We will start it soon." He also said that Health department will treat patients wherever necessary. "We will bear the expenses," he added. Considering seriousness of the outbreak, the health authorities including CMO Kupwara, BMO [Block Medical Officer] Sogam, and district tuberculosis officer (DTO) Kupwara rushed to the area and held a meeting to carry out mass screening of the people in the area.

Talking to Greater Kashmir, BMO Sogam Dr Firdous Ahmed said, "We have decided to carry out screening of 1640 students of different schools of Diver area on priority and in the 2nd phase more than 9000 people of the area will be screened."

"We have established a full-fledged lab at sub centre Diver, where tests of the locals will be conducted," BMO said. "We have problem of funds as expenses will be incurred on sampling, testing and immunization. At this stage it is not clear that where from the funds will come," the BMO said.

A team from Directorate of Health comprising of a Microbiologist and Epidemiologist visited the area today and took stock of the situation. "To carry out mass screening of the villagers including local schools to prevent the disease from further spreading we have started health education in the area and are involving panchayat [local self-government council] representatives, anganwadi [courtyard shelter] workers, ASHA [accredited social health activists] workers, and telling people about "dos and don'ts of hepatitis B," an official said.

No mass awareness activity has been carried out in the area to date to educate people about hepatitis B and how it spreads from person to person. According to doctors, there is a misconception that this disease is waterborne. The doctors and health care people blamed local chemists, barber shops, and "quacks" who 'operate in unhygienic conditions' for the spread of disease.

"Some news outlets had also reported wrong facts about the means of spreading hepatitis B, adding to the confusion and risking lives of people. The infection is blood borne and can spread through infected needles and unsafe blood transfusion and re-use of infected blades for shaving. So the medical team is conducting awareness program to prevent the spread of infection," BMO Sogam, Dr Firdous Ahmad said.

"Most of the chemists and dental clinics are violating the norms and operate in unhygienic conditions using unsterilized surgical instruments," said a doctor. He said that this disease might have spread due to infected blades or dental procedures. There are also reports of people taking services of quacks sitting on roadsides for extraction of teeth, fillings etc. He added that barbers re-use the blades which helps spread of disease. "To prevent it from spreading further we have asked people to take precautionary measures," he further said.

[Indeed, as noted in this posting, earlier reports attributed the increase cases to contaminated water. If this were the case, the outbreak could have been acute hepatitis E occurring in hepatitis B virus carriers.

In many reports such as this, it is difficult to assess how many of the patients have acute hepatitis B and how many have chronic infection when diagnosed. They can be differentiated serologically by the presence of IgM anti-hepatitis B core antigen in the blood in acute cases. When hepatitis B is acquired in adulthood, generally 5-10 percent of those affected will be chronic carriers with a risk of cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. However, if the disease is acquired neonatally from vertical transmission from infected mother to neonate, the risk of that individual being a chronic carrier can be 95 percent. The hepatitis B vaccine is quite effective and safe in preventing infection. In chronically infected individuals, there are a number of medications that can be useful in treatment include lamivudine, tenofovir, and adefovir, all used in HIV treatment as reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
