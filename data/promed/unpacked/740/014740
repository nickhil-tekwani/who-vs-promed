Cholera in Afghanistan, Update 2 - This is a press release issued by the
WHO Office in Afghanistan.
World Health Organisation (WHO) in Afghanistan reports worsening of the
national outbreak of acute gastroenteritis and suspected cholera in some
regions. Only six hospitals in Kabul last week reported 1,400 cases of
acute severe diarrhoea, gastroenteritis, and suspected cholera. This is the
third week of the epidemic and more emergency medical supplies provided by
WHO -Afghanistan have now reached Kabul and distribution is underway.
In Bamyan from the 19th to the 26th of August 1998, 328 cases of acute
severe diarrhoea and suspected cholera were reported including 28 deaths of
affected men, women, and children. The civil war in Afghanistan has brought
thousands of internally displaced people into the Bamyan area from the
North. This overcrowding has further aggravated the dangerous situation of
water and sanitation. At the same time, the isolation of the area means
that the health facilities have little surplus to respond to the pressure
of an epidemic. The hospital and clinics in Bamyan have minimal supplies of
antibiotics and ORS to last until the end of the week. Their supply of
intravenous fluid is exhausted and they are borrowing from Afghan Red
Crescent Society supplies of fluids provided by ICRC for war wounded.
In response to the suspected cholera outbreak, WHO-Afghanistan began
shipping emergency supplies to every region of Afghanistan in the middle of
August. Supplies for Bamyan were waiting for the next UN flight from
Islamabad when the US missile attacks on Afghanistan occurred and all
flights were suspended. This week WHO is arranging for transfer of
emergency medical supplies from Ghazni by road. Using the only available
land route, the supplies can reach Bamyan no sooner than 3-4 days due to
the bad road conditions.
The long road to Bamyan also crosses two front lines in the civil war.
However, since the World Health Organisation has a long-standing reputation
as being neutral and impartial and having a good relationship with
authorities on either side of the border, permit has been granted and their
trucks of supplies expect to get through safely.
In other areas of Afghanistan the outbreak of suspected cholera has
continued to claim lives -- Baghlan, Laghman, Takhar, Samangan, Kunduz,
Badakhshan, Uruzgan and Ghazni. A new outbreak of acute gastroenteritis was
reported this week from Herat with 86 hospitalized and one death. Control
of the outbreak depends on providing safe drinking water through
chlorination or other means and health education about using ORS to treat
diarrhoea to prevent dehydration. To contain the epidemic and avoid future
outbreaks, city-wide and nation-wide efforts are required to improve water
and sanitation.
