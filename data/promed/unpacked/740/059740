[This posting summarizes information obtained from the Nando net (via Jim
Chin's CDPC; Fri, 26 Dec 1997 09:09:19), The Fort Collins Coloradoan
(newspaper), ANIMALNET (D. Powell, Univ. Guelph, via Robert A. LaBudde;
Fri, 26 Dec 1997 18:46:43 -0500; and from the BBC News web page
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/newsid_42000/42667.stm>, and other
media sources as reported by Angie Finchley, Special Correspondent to
ProMED-mail. Although none contains clear-cut results, certain aspects of
these reports need clarification. Clearly we are at an early stage in
understanding the epidemiology and etiology of this outbreak. Comments in
brackets are mine - Mod.CHC]

1. One report indicates three dead, another "at least 45", and there are
unconfirmed rumors of 217 dead north of Nairobi in Kenya.
2. Reports of this hemorrhagic disease in Kenya have been complemented by
reports from the Somali Red Cross of a similar illness in people in
southern Somalia, across the border from Kenya. They report that 42 people
died in the past week in Torotorow, 70 miles south of Mogadishu. All the
victims had suffered from high fevers, severe stomach cramps and vomited
blood.
3. In Kenya, doctors so far have confirmed just three deaths from the
disease, all of which occurred last week at a hospital in the remote
northeastern town of Garissa. They were trying to verify local reports that
171 people had died from the disease in flooded villages in northeastern
Kenya. Newspapers said the victims had high fevers, diarrhea and vomiting,
and bled from the nose and mouth. Tests performed on one [one!] Kenyan
found he had severe malaria, but one investigator said it was too early to
conclude that malaria had caused all of the illnesses. "I am personally not
ready to say it is malaria. We need results on 10 or 20 or 30 persons,"
said Douglas Klaucke, acting World Health Organization representative in
Kenya. "We've not stopped looking."
4. The first batch of specimens gathered in the Kenyan villages of Garissa
and Wajir, 200 miles and 350 miles northwest of Nairobi, respectively
[Another report has Garissa, 140 miles northeast of Nairobi. This is the
correct direction but it is more like 200 mi. It appears the reporters are
not on site.], were expected back in the capital late Thursday for testing
Friday. It was unclear when samples from Somalia would arrive.
5. Twelve possible diseases are being investigated, including anthrax,
yellow fever, dengue, Rift Valley fever and relapsing fever. On Saturday,
Peter Tukei, a medical doctor and senior virologist at the Kenya Medical
Research Institute is reported to have said that priority is currently
being given to ruling out anthrax.
6. Ebola, which also causes its victims to bleed from the mouth and other
orifices, has tentatively been ruled out. A few patients who have made it
into Garissa by foot have not transmitted their illness to their
caretakers, Klaucke said. "We have got our fingers crossed that it is not
transmittable from human to human," Klaucke said.
7. Both outbreaks occurred along rivers, the Ewaso Nyiro river in Kenya and
the Shabelle River in Somalia. Experts speculate that flooding brought on
by El Nino contaminated drinking water and "triggered a boom of mosquitoes,
lice and ticks that breed in floodwaters. Those pests, in turn, may have
caused the disease to spread." [My quotes. If "experts" said this, they
are not experts; mosquitoes, of course.]
8. Kenyans are reporting this disease in livestock. [However, the reports
are not clear as to the symptoms of the livestock illness, although the
reports are written to suggest that livestock have the same symptoms as do
people.]
"We're concerned it may be something that affects both animals and people,"
said Klaucke. "If that were the case, then it would be something (other)
than malaria," he said. [other diseases, such as yellow fever, might also
be ruled out at least preliminarily].
Ebola, which also causes its victims to bleed from the mouth and other
orifices, tentatively has been ruled out.

[Should a relationship be shown to exist between the human and animal
illnesses, that would certainly assist in guiding a diagnosis. The bottom
line remains laboratory confirmation but at this stage one cannot rule out
Rift Valley fever or other serious illnesses. Until we receive or locate
more definitive reports, we will not post any more on this outbreak. -
