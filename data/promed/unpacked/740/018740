Mysterious disease kills 2
--------------------------
The death of 2 more people from the yet unidentified disease in
Bundibugyo district has intensified fear among residents. A Uganda
People's Defence Forces (UPDF) soldier attached to Butogo army detach
and a local man died on Tuesday [9 Dec 2008]. The local man, a
resident of Ntoroto parish in Kasitu Sub County met his death at
Kikyo Health Centre IV, where he had been admitted. At the time of
his admission, he had high fever, was vomiting and passing out blood.

The Chief Administrative Officer Bundibugyo, Elias Byamungu said the
dead UPDF soldier had been admitted at Bundibugyo Hospital on Monday
[8 Dec 2008]. He said 2 other patients who had been admitted in the
isolation ward have been discharged.

The district health officer, Dr. William Sikeyewunda said blood
samples have been sent to Entebbe for investigations. Last week [1-5
Dec 2008], the ministry of health and World Health Organisation
officials rushed to Bundibugyo, following the death of 15 people,
from suspected hepatitis E. The blood samples were taken to the
Uganda Virus Research Institute in Entebbe and the results returned negative.

The Ministry of Health has dismissed reports that it might be the
re-emergence of the deadly Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fevers,
which hit Bundibugyo district last year [2007].

[It appears that laboratory tests have not confirmed the suspicion
that hepatitis E virus infection had reached the Bindibugyo district
from those district of Uganda harboring refugees from the country's
northern neighbors.

The 2 most recent fatal cases in the district exhibited signs and
symptoms reminiscent of the outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever which
affected the district earlier in 2008. The local health authorities
are discounting this, perhaps to allay panic in the area. Further
information would be welcomed as soon as a final diagnosis becomes available.
