Tests have confirmed a 2nd animal positive for brucellosis in an eastern
Idaho herd. The disease is highly infectious and can cause cattle to abort.
Idaho State veterinarian Bill Barton said all animals in the herd have been
tested and most results are back.

The department and the industry take a brucellosis finding seriously as
another finding in a separate herd would cause the state to lose its
brucellosis-free status, wreaking havoc on cattlemen's ability to market
their animals. The industry lost its brucellosis-free status in January
2006. Aggressive action saw the state regain its status in July 2007.

Although another animal was found to be suspect for the disease discovered
last week, further testing confirmed it was not infected. The 2 positive
animals were found in a 600 head herd based in Rigby and assembled over the
last couple of years, Barton said.

Further testing was needed on the 1st animal, a 15 year old cow, because it
was vaccinated with an older vaccine that can show a false positive with
the standard blood test. "The vaccine is the best we have, but at 15 years
of age, immunity is waning a little bit," Barton said. The older strain 19
vaccine has about the same efficacy as the newer RB15 vaccine, but where
it's been used, epidemiologist must take a milk sample and culture the
tissue for a definitive diagnosis. All animals in the herd had been
vaccinated as required by the state, Barton said.

The 1st positive finding came as a result of another animal from the herd
testing suspect at slaughter. "All animals at the slaughter plant are
inspected with a blood test," Barton said. If one shows up positive or
suspect, all animals in the herd are tested. "We are continuing our
investigation as rapidly as possible," he said. That entails not only
testing the herd, which is now complete, but also tracing animals to their
herd of origin and testing those herds. Barton has confirmed that all
animals that left the herd were sold to slaughter.

That's good news in regard to any possible forward infection from the herd.
The question now is whether the herds where the animals originated are
infected. Barton is more of the mind that the infection came from wild elk
or bison that the herd came in contact with.

Brucellosis is prevalent in those wild animals in the Greater Yellowstone
Area and the herd summers in the Teton Basin. Cattlemen in the West are
anxiously awaiting Idaho's testing results.

Brucellosis is one of a handful of bovine diseases that cause concerns when
it comes to moving cattle from state to state, said Matt Byrne, vice
president of the California Cattlemen's Association. California is
brucellosis-free and cattle producers want it to stay that way, he said.
"Hopefully we'll find that it is a localized incident and won't have an
impact on California," he said.

California has had its own infectious disease troubles with tuberculosis,
which has infected 8 cows in the state since January 2008, according to the
state's Department of Food and Agriculture. About 419 000 head of cattle
have been TB tested, 2 herds depopulated and more than 8000 cattle killed
as part of an ongoing investigation, the CDFA [California Department of
Food and Agriculture] reports. The USDA last year [2008] stripped
California of its tuberculosis-free status, causing cattle to have to be
tested before they leave the state.

[Idaho is located close to California, as can be seen on the map at
<http://healthmap.org/r/010E>. Idaho and California have quite an exchange
of goods from fruit to cattle, and even a migration of people between these
states.

According to
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_dis_spec/cattle/downloads/rb51_vaccine.pdf>
RB51 was licensed for use in 1996. So while this vaccine moved through
transition of being phased in while Strain 19 was being phased out, it is
entirely possible that there is an aged cow that was vaccinated with Strain 19.

Strain 19 vaccination was phased out because it created many false
positives within the testing scheme, which was costly to producers. Now 13
years down the road, there are questions as to the long term efficacy of
RB51 by some groups.

The disease in cattle, water buffalo, and bison is caused almost
exclusively by _Brucella abortus_ ; however, _B. suis or B. melitensis_ are
occasionally implicated in some cattle herds. _B. suis_ does not appear to
be contagious from cow to cow. Infection spreads rapidly and causes many
abortions in unvaccinated cattle. In a herd in which the disease is
endemic, an infected cow typically aborts only once after exposure;
subsequent gestations and lactations appear normal. After exposure, cattle
become bacteremic for a short period and develop agglutinins and other
antibodies; some resist infection and a small percentage of infected cows
recover. A positive serum agglutination test usually precedes an abortion
or a normal parturition but may be delayed in about 15 per cent of cows.
The incubation period may be variable and is inversely related to stage of
gestation at time of exposure. Organisms are shed in milk and uterine
discharges, and the cow may become temporarily infertile. Bacteria may be
found in the uterus during pregnancy, uterine involution, and infrequently,
for a prolonged time, in the non-gravid uterus. Shedding from the vagina
largely disappears with the decrease of fluids following parturition. Some
infected cows that previously aborted shed brucellae from the uterus at
subsequent normal parturitions. Organisms are shed in milk for a variable
length of time -- in most cattle for life.

Natural transmission occurs by ingestion of organisms, which are present in
large numbers in aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and uterine discharges.
Cattle may ingest contaminated feed and water, or lick contaminated
genitals of other animals. Venereal transmission by infected bulls to
susceptible cows appears to be rare. Transmission may occur by artificial
insemination when _Brucella_ -contaminated semen is deposited in the uterus
but, reportedly, not when deposited in the mid-cervix. Brucellae may enter
the body through mucous membranes, conjunctivae, wounds, or intact skin.

Brucellae have been recovered from fetuses and from manure that has
remained in a cool environment for more than 2 months. Exposure to direct
sunlight kills the organisms within a few hours.

Because organisms are shed in the milk, unpasteurized milk, and cheese
represent a human health concern. Many individuals believe drinking
unpasteurized milk is better for their health. Diseases that are not killed
by pasteurization represent a risk to the consumer. Brucellosis in humans
causes malaise, fever, chills, sweats, headache, neck pain, low back pain,
joint pain, muscle pain, occasionally diarrhea, constipation, anorexia,
weight loss, abdominal pain, weakness, irritability, insomnia, and
depression. Brucellosis has been called undulating fever because of its
habit of producing fever and signs that wax and wane over an extended
period of time.
