Cattle dead, humans ill from foot and mouth disease in Peru
-----------------------------------------------------------
Peru on Friday reported an outbreak of the contagious foot and mouth
disease (FMD) in cattle -- its 1st in 6 months -- and said 9 cattle had
died and 10 people were infected.
Peru's National Service of Agrarian Health (SENASA) said the Sama valley on
Peru's southern coast where the outbreak occurred was sealed off and the
situation was under control. "There are some 2600 animals in the valley and
not more than 60 animals are at risk," SENASA's director Oscar Dominguez
told Reuters.
SENASA has sent 4000 vaccination doses to the valley to contain the disease
and did not plan to slaughter animals. Dominguez said the new outbreak had
been caused by bacteria in the earth from an earlier, more serious outbreak
in the valley in the 1950s.
Edgar Tejada, director of health services in the southern department of
Tacna bordering Chile, told RPP radio earlier on Friday the people who were
infected were from the same family.
"Since Jan 3, we have registered 10 cases (of infection in humans) from
handling tainted meat and meat products," Tejada said. 7 people have been
hospitalized but their condition is improving, he said. The disease is mild
in humans, typically creating flu-like symptoms and mouth blisters.
In June 2004, Peru reported its 1st outbreak of FMD since 2000 and
slaughtered at least 88 cattle to control it. Although not an exporter of
beef, Peru is keen to recover its FMD-free status because the virus can be
transported, for example, with exported fruit and vegetables. If unchecked
it also could affect Peru's negotiations to secure a free-trade treaty with
the United States, which is free of the disease.

[Typically FMD is extremely mild in humans, with symptoms similar to those
of the common cold. It is extremely unusual for this many people to be
affected. When people are affected, they are often workers in a laboratory
where there is a high concentration of the virus. But hand foot and mouth
disease (usually caused by coxsackievirus A16 but also by other
enteroviruses, including strain 71) also produces blisters in the mouth.
The FMD virus (within the family Picornaviridae) produces blisters in the
mouths of animals, not people.
It is now summer in Peru, so survival in the environment will be limited.
Certainly the virus can survive in the environment, as follows: in dry
feces for 14 days; in urine for 39 days; in slurry for 6 months; in the
ground in summer for 3 days; and in the winter 28 days.
Survival of FMD virus is dependent upon the pH of the environment as well,
favoring a neutral pH, as follows:
pH / inactivation time at 4 deg C
---------
2 / 1 min
4 / 2 min
5.5 / 30 min
5.8 / 18 hours
11 / 2 hours
12 / 2.5 min
13 / 2.5 min
Reference: <http://aleffgroup.com/avisfmd/A010-fmd/mod3/3520-survival.html>
The FMD virus is not likely to survive on vegetables that are exported. The
possibility that this report is describing two distinct diseases must be
borne in mind and ProMED-mail would appreciate clarification of the
situation from informed sources. - Mod.TG]
