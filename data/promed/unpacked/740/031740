On Tuesday [11 Jan 2011], 6 duck farms in Naju and Yeongam County, South
Jeolla Province, were found to be affected by highly pathogenic strains of
avian influenza.

The Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said suspected cases
of bird flu at 3 duck farms in Naju and 3 others in Yeongam were found to
be those of the deadly strain of avian influenza.

Suspected cases were also reported in Suncheon, South Jeolla Province.

With 13 farms affected by bird flu in the province, the number of birds
culled surpassed 800 000. A quarantine official said, "We are making every
effort to prevent the virus that has already affected South Jeolla Province
from spreading to other regions."

Bird flu is spreading northward to Seoul and metropolitan areas from
central parts of the country.

The National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service (NVRQS) confirmed
Monday [10 Jan 2011] that ducks at a farm in Anseong, Gyeonggi Province,
and another farm in Naju, South Jeolla Province, tested positive for the
virulent strain of H5N1 avian influenza.

Anseong was the 3rd region to be hit by the disease since 29 Dec 2010, with
previous cases breaking out in Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province, and
Iksan, North Jeolla Province.

The avian flu outbreak was confirmed at 10 poultry farms in these
provinces, with an additional 10 farms having reported suspected cases of
the highly contagious bird disease. Some wild birds in South Gyeongsang
Province were also found dead from H5N1 [virus infection].

Upon the news that the bird disease is spreading, quarantine officials are
in a plight, as they have already been fighting FMD.

[The current HPAI H5N1 epizootic in South Korea reportedly started on 29
Nov 2010 with the identification of the virus in a mallard duck sampled in
the southern province of North Jeolla within the framework of the
continuous avian influenza surveillance programme. Until 7 Jan 2011
(follow-up report no 3), 4 additional separate cases were reported in wild
birds and 3 outbreaks were recorded on commercial farms, of which 2 were
duck farms and one a chicken farm (see ProMED-mail no. 20110108.0097 and an
interactive map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10029>).
As can be seen on the map, domestic poultry were infected in the provinces
Jeollanam-do (South Jeolla), Jeollabuk-do (North Jeolla), and
Chungcheongnam-do (South Chungcheong).

Naju and Yeongan, where new outbreaks have now been recorded in 6 duck
farms, can be seen on the interactive WAHID map above when ticking
'Built-up areas' and 'Locality' and zooming in.
