Minnesota is grappling with its worst outbreak of livestock anthrax
in 87 years, state officials said on Thursday. The [disease] has
killed 68 head of livestock on 23 farms in northwest Minnesota since
mid-June 2006, the state's board of animal health said. Minnesota has
had anthrax cases in livestock in recent years, but this year's
outbreak is the worst since 1919. Most of the Minnesota livestock
deaths were cattle, but 5 bison and about 6 horses also died, the
board of animal health said.
Canada also reported anthrax outbreaks, with at least 234 cattle
deaths this summer in the prairie provinces. [Checking on this
number. - Mod.MHJ]
To protect against the disease, state animal health officials are
advising livestock producers to vaccinate cattle, bison, and horses.
The increase in cases has surprised animal health officials.
Outbreaks often occur when extremely wet or flood conditions are
followed by a dry spell. Those conditions were not present this year,
said Malissa Fritz, spokeswoman for the board of animal health. "In
the areas where we are seeing the cases, they did not have the
flooding this year," said Fritz. "We are seeing very dry conditions
right now, but we did not have those dry conditions around 15 Jun
2006. There have been a number of questions as to why we are seeing
this increase this year," she said.
The most recent outbreaks have been confined to Kittson, Roseau, Red
Lake and Lake of the Woods counties in extreme northwest Minnesota.
"Those 4 counties are where all 68 animals were found," said Fritz.

Anthrax [has been] confirmed in cattle, bison, and horses in Kittson,
Roseau, Red Lake, & Lake of the Woods counties
Anthrax cases in northwestern Minnesota have continued to rise
steadily throughout the summer. Since the middle of June [2006], 23
farms in Kittson, Roseau, Red Lake, & Lake of the Woods Counties have
had animals test positive for the disease, making this the 2nd
largest anthrax outbreak in the state's history. The worst anthrax
outbreak on record was in 1919 when 42 sites were infected.
There have been few reported cases of anthrax in North and South
Dakota, but the Canadian province of Saskatchewan has seen record
levels of the disease. Minnesota's 1st case this year [2006] was identified
in mid-June, when 6 head of cattle from a farm in Kittson County
tested positive. Since that time, 68 animals have died as a result of
anthrax including cattle, bison, and horses.
Minnesota Board of Animal Health Senior Veterinarian Dr. Linda Glaser
advises livestock producers to consult their veterinarian about
anthrax vaccination. "We see anthrax cases throughout the summer so
producers still have time to vaccinate their livestock," said Glaser.
"Farmers can obtain anthrax vaccine from their veterinarian and
vaccinate their own livestock." As an added precaution, farmers in
Northwest Minnesota should assume that any unexpected deaths among
their livestock are due to anthrax until the disease can be ruled
out. If carcasses are found, a veterinarian should be contacted
immediately. Suspect carcasses should not be cut open, as that can
allow anthrax to spread. If anthrax is confirmed, the carcass should
be burned, and the ashes should be buried on site.
Anthrax is a naturally occurring disease caused by the bacterium
_Bacillus anthracis_. All warm-blooded animals are susceptible to the
disease, but cattle, horses, sheep, and goats are most commonly
affected. The bacteria can lie dormant for years in the soil. In some
cases, heavy rains and flooding bring the spores to the surface where
they may be eaten by grazing animals. However, many of the cases
this year occurred on land that did not flood in the spring.
Livestock infected with anthrax can die quickly, often exhibiting no
symptoms until just before death.

[I think we can assume that the outbreaks in Lake of the Woods and
Red Lake counties are probably from separate primary outbreaks
because of their distance from the major activity in Kitson County.
