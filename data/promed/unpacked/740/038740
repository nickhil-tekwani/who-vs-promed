Information received at the OIE Headquarters on 12 Nov 2004 from Dr
Isabelle Chmitelin, deputy director general, General Directorate for Food
(DGAL), Ministry of Agriculture, Food, Fisheries, and Rural Affairs, Paris:
Detection of an infective agent molecularly and biologically compatible
with that of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in a goat in France
Date of the report: 2 Nov 2004.
The French network for typing strains in cases of scrapie detected within
the framework of the European Union surveillance program has reported the
presence of an infective agent molecularly and biologically compatible with
the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent in a goat slaughtered in 2002.
This network of 7 French public sector research laboratories in France was
set up in 2002. Its aim is to conduct research into the development of
analytical methods capable of discriminating between the BSE strain and the
natural scrapie strain in small ruminants.
Virtually all of the positive isolates obtained from small ruminants with
scrapie, detected through the various surveillance programs established in
France since 1996, have undergone diagnostic testing. These consist of
first line molecular tests supplemented for samples considered to be
"atypical" by inoculation into transgenic mice, which is the reference test
to distinguish BSE from scrapie.
Scrapie cannot be confirmed until the end of the incubation period in mice,
a minimum of 6 months in the fastest strains of mice. Among these atypical
samples inoculated into mice, one sample presented suspicious
characteristics when the mice had reached the end of the incubation period.
The sample came from a goat aged 2 and a half years when it was slaughtered
in 2002. This goat was the only animal affected in its herd of origin,
which totaled 600 animals (300 adult goats in production and 300 young
goats). The whole herd was culled, and all the adult goats were tested at
that time with negative results. All the carcasses, including that of the
affected goat, were destroyed.
Experimental studies still need to be carried out to determine the exact
nature of the pathogen. The data have also been sent to the Weybridge
laboratory in the United Kingdom.

[While this report gives some information on how the surveillance sample
was obtained, there is little information on the pathology of the affected
individual or the epidemiology of the herd involved.
Epidemiological investigation serves multiple functions. In this case, the
public's health is protected by slaughter of the herd of origin for the
goat. However, new findings always give us a chance to learn more about the
epidemiology of the disease. Questions remaining are detailed in previous
moderator comments (see BSE, goats - France 2002: susp 20041030.2929) and
include the age of the goat, whether it had been fed meat and bone meal,
and the possibility of horizontal transmission. Clearly, this is an
interesting finding, and it may have much to teach us about one of the most
inscrutable group of diseases, the transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies. - Mod.PC]
