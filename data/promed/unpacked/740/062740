Human Metapneumovirus Found in Children in Australia
----------------------------------------------------
BRISBANE: A virus similar to one found in turkeys [Turkey rhinotracheitis
virus, also known as Avian pneumovirus - Mod.CP has been identified in
Australian children with respiratory ailments, according to a multi-centre
research team in Queensland. The virus, [designated provisionally as Human
metapneumovirus, was [described for the first time recently by Dutch
researchers. It seems the virus causes lower respiratory tract infections
similar to, but generally milder than, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
RSV causes cold-like symptoms, but can result in pneumonia and other
potentially life-threatening infections and is the leading cause of hospital
admissions in young children.
Dr. Michael Nissen, Director of Infectious Diseases at the Royal Children's
Hospital, said that there have now been 38 confirmed cases of human
metapneumovirus infection, but it may be a relatively common virus. "It is
hypothesised that possibly this virus has crossed over from birds into
humans," said Nissen, who recently published a report on 3 cases of the
virus in the Medical Journal of Australia [see: Medical Journal of Australia
2002; 176:188. He added that the Dutch have proven that the virus has been
around for at least 20 years by testing for antibodies in old stored blood
samples.
"I am aware of it being detected in the UK last winter, and also aware of it
in Perth and Sydney, Australia, and I know I have colleagues in the US who
are looking for it as well," Nissen told Reuters Health. He noted that in up
to 40% of cases, doctors cannot determine the cause of infection in
youngsters with viral pneumonia or inflammation of the air tubes in the
lungs. This is true even when the children have signs of pneumonia on x-rays
and have "wheeze, cough, shortness of breath, respiratory distress; all the
symptoms that you would associate with a viral pneumonitis." Nissen added
that: "Most children have antibodies to this virus by about the age of 5."
In the journal report, Nissen and colleagues tested 200 samples from
children with respiratory ailments that were negative for other known
viruses. Of those, 3 were positive for [human metapneumovirus: a 1-year-old
girl, a 6-year-old boy and a 20-month-old boy. In the most severe cases,
children with the virus have required oxygen or needed a ventilator to
assist breathing. "We've also had one potential death, but I'm not entirely
sure whether [human metapneumovirus [infection was the cause of the
death," he said. Of the 3 children described in the report, one was admitted
to the hospital for 3 days and given oxygen and nasal suctioning. The other
2 had symptoms treated at home. "We've picked it up in babies, so it could
be spread in special care nurseries," said Nissen, "and we've picked it up
in children with cystic fibrosis and other chronic lung conditions. It tends
to be a bit more severe in those cases."
Nissen suggested that doctors be on the alert "if the child is having
problems with feeding, so is not tolerating fluids, appears dehydrated, has
a respiratory distress, and they're concerned that maybe the child is
becoming hypoxic, requiring oxygen." There's no known therapy for the virus,
except for treating the symptoms as they occur.
The researcher pointed out that a major problem is that "human
metapneumovirus goes unrecognised, mainly because it's a very slow growing
virus and difficult to grow in culture. It's nearly indistinguishable from
human respiratory syncytial virus infection. [Human metapneumovirus and RSV
are antigenically distinct with only limited nucleotide sequence homology,
consequently, in principle, specific diagnostic tests are within easy reach. -
Mod.CP.
"In general, though, it seems to be less severe, but we're picking it up in
children aged 0-2 years, and it's a common cause of bronchiolitis in
infants. We are carefully looking at all the 38 cases to see if there are
some features that allow us to [distinguish it clincally from RSV." And,
Nissen said, "There's no routine lab testing for it at the moment. We've
diagnosed all our cases by (slow) testing, or by viral culture, but we are
developing a rapid test, so we can pick it up more quickly."

[In June 2001 van den Hoogen et al., at the Erasmus Medical Center in
Rotterdam, reported the discovery of a novel human pneumovirus present in
young children with respiratory tract disease (see: Nat Med 2001 Jun 7(6);
719-724). The virus was recovered from 28 children and identified as a
tentative new member of the genus _Metapneumovirus_ of the sub-family
_Pneumovirinae_ of the family _Paramyxoviridae_ , based on virological
data, sequence homology and gene organisation. The defining member of this
genus is Turkey rhinotracheitis virus (avian pneumovirus) which is
reponsible for severe respiratory disease in domestic fowl. The
metapneumoviruses are distinguished from the pneumoviruses (bovine RSV, human
RSV and pneumonia virus of mice) principally by a genome inversion. The
clinical symptoms of the children from whom the human metapneumovirus was
isolated were similar to those caused by RSV infection, ranging from upper
respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia. From
serological studies they concluded that by the age of 5 years virtually all
children in the Netherlands have been exposed to human metapneumovirus and
that the virus has been circulating in humans for at least 50 years.
Subsequently the same virus was found to be equally prevalent in the United
Kingdom. The above report from Australia confirms the suspicion that this
newly identified pathogen of infancy, like human RSV, is prevalent
world-wide. The discovery of this virus complicates efforts to control
bronchiolitis and viral pneumonia in infants by vaccination.
The possible avian origin of this human pathogen is intriguing. Four
serotypes of Turkey rhinotracheitis virus (avian pneumovirus) are known and
the newly discovered human metapneumovirus shows closest resemblance by
phylogenetic analysis to avian pneumovirus type C, which is found
predominantly in domestic fowl in the USA. - Mod.CP
[These reports raise the question of whether the newly discovered
human metapneumovirus may cause more serious infections in
immunocompromised adults, much like RSV - Mod.LM
