Poliomyelitis in Yemen - update 30 May 2005
-----------------------------------------------
On 29 May [2005], the Ministry of Health Yemen confirmed an additional 71
cases, bringing the total number of cases associated with this outbreak to
179. The majority of the new cases are from the same governorate as the
index case, Hudaidah governorate, on the Red Sea coast. These additional
cases were expected, as a significant increase in acute flaccid paralysis
(AFP) cases had been detected since the start of the outbreak.
The outbreak was reported on 22 Apr [2005], and the 1st case had onset of
paralysis on 25 Feb [2005]. Currently, 11 governorates are known to be
affected by the outbreak.
The rise in cases underlines the urgent need to conduct high-quality
immunization campaigns to rapidly boost population immunity levels. As part
of this effort, on 29 May [2005] the Ministry of Health launched a
nationwide immunization campaign, to reach all of the country's children
under the age of 5 years with polio vaccine. More than 32 000 vaccinators
have been recruited by the Ministry of Health. Between 30 May and 2 Jun
[2005], these vaccinators will go house-to-house to administer polio
vaccine to all children under 5 years of age across Yemen. The 2nd round
National Immunization Day (NID) will be launched on 11 Jul [2005].
Yemen has significantly strengthened active AFP surveillance throughout the
country to determine the spread of the outbreak and is implementing
appropriate nationwide immunization campaigns to rapidly boost population
immunity levels. To support the Ministry of Health, all UN organizations,
led by WHO and UNICEF, have joined forces to make these polio campaigns a
UN-priority in Yemen.

[Earlier announcements on this ongoing outbreak had mentioned that up to
200 cases were to be expected, based on the number of acute flaccid
paralysis (AFP) cases found during active surveillance (active surveillance
refers to actively looking for cases in the communities rather than
passively waiting for cases to come to the health sector for treatment).
The numbers of cases given above (a total of 179) reflects those AFP cases
that have been confirmed. As there may be more AFP cases pending
confirmation, the total case count may still rise. Hopefully, the national
immunization day activities will reach sufficient numbers of susceptible
people to interrupt transmission of the wild poliovirus. - Mod.MPP]
