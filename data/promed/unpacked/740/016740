VN vaccination campaign succeeds in controlling measles outbreak
-------------------------
A baby receives vaccine against measles and rubella at Song Mai Health clinic in Song Mai Commune, Bac Giang Province. More than 19.7 million children, aged between 1 and 14 years, were vaccinated against measles and rubella during a 6-month vaccination campaign that ended in May 2015. The children comprised 98.2 per cent of the total targeted children nationwide.

"The campaign has contributed towards achieving complete control over the measles outbreak in Viet Nam in 2015," Health Minister Nguyen Thi Kim Tien said at a conference to review the campaign in Ha Noi today. "At the moment, no measles outbreak has been reported in Viet Nam. Only 80 measles cases were detected in the country since the beginning of 2015," Tien said. The minister said the campaign helped to increase people's awareness about the use of vaccines to prevent diseases, especially those living in remote, mountainous areas.

No serious post-vaccination incident leading to any fatality was reported during the 6-month campaign. Some chain reactions were detected among student groups in localities such as Lao Cai, Thanh Hoa and Ba Ria-Vung Tau provinces and HCM City. The campaign reported nearly 15 870 cases with slight reactions, such as fever, pain in the injected area or headache.

This was the result of the health sector's efforts to ensure the quality of the vaccine and the vaccination process. Launched in September 2014, the country's largest-ever vaccination campaign aims to reduce measles and rubella infections in the community. It also aims to eliminate measles in Viet Nam by 2017 and rubella by a future date. The combined measles and rubella vaccine was supported through a USD 34.6-million grant from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI).

Case of measles suspected in Baltimore County child
-------------------
A case of measles is suspected in Baltimore County child.The Baltimore County and Baltimore City health departments are investigating a possible case of measles, a highly contagious virus that grabbed headlines earlier in e year because of an outbreak that stemmed from unvaccinated children in Los Angeles.

Amid the measles outbreak, public health officials take on obstacles to vaccination
----
Cases are rare in Maryland, which has high vaccination rates, and officials say the possible case is isolated so far. The child, who was not identified, lives in Baltimore County and is unvaccinated. The child recently visited Sinai Hospital in northern Baltimore City with measles symptoms, city officials said. The child, who is expected to recover, is now in home isolation, and a test to confirm the virus is pending.

Officials from the state Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are helping identify unvaccinated contacts.

There have only been 3 cases of measles in Maryland in the past 5 years, none in Baltimore County or city. A 2014-2015 state survey shows about 99.2 percent of kindergartners and 99.4 percent of grade school children were immunized.

Children typically receive a combination vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR. Measles is easily spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Symptoms include fever, rash, runny nose and red eyes.

"This may be a false alarm and the patient may not have measles," said Dr. Leana Wen, Baltimore City health commissioner. "However, measles is highly contagious, and out of an abundance of caution, we are treating this as a suspected measles case and taking every necessary precaution to ensure the health and safety of Baltimore residents."

Sinai Hospital said it was coordinating with the health agencies and working to notify workers and visitors in the emergency department the morning of 6 Aug 2015 when the child came in.

"Upon recognition of a possible measles case, Sinai Hospital staff acted quickly to take precautions to reduce exposures," said Sharon Boston, a spokeswoman for Sinai. "Protecting our patients, visitors and employees is our responsibility and highest priority. We are taking appropriate action to ensure the health and safety of all those who may have been in contact with this patient."

Authorities are urging people to make sure their measles vaccinations are up-to-date. A measles alert for Brisbane's south has widened with a 2nd university attendee diagnosed. For the 2nd time in a week the health department is urging University of Queensland students to be on the lookout for symptoms and pleading with adults to check their vaccinations. The latest patient attended lectures at the UQ Faculty of Engineering on Monday and Tuesday and the Alumni Court on Monday while infected with the disease. He also visited Coles Fairfield late Sunday afternoon and early Wednesday afternoon before heading to the Prince of India restaurant in the evening.

A measles alert on Tuesday urged anyone who had been to lectures at the university's business faculty on 29 or 31 Jul and 3 Aug 2015. A Metro South Health Service spokesman said he couldn't confirm a link between the 2 cases but it was possible. "It's not 100 per cent," she said. "Just given the same location, that is a possibility. It's very difficult though in big locations to definitely say."

Metro South Health (MSH) public health physician Dr Kari Jarvinen said measles was a serious viral infection causing fever, cough and a runny nose before a red spotty rash and sore eyes a few days later. He said that, given the number of people potentially exposed, further measles cases could present in Brisbane or elsewhere over the next few weeks. "If people are adequately vaccinated with 2 recorded doses of Measles Mumps Rubella (MMR) vaccine, they are very unlikely to get the disease," he said.

"People who are unsure or have concerns about their immunity to measles should contact their doctor to check whether they have had both vaccines." Measles, one of the most infectious illnesses, is spread by coughing or sneezing. Patients with possible symptoms, which can develop 10 days or more after exposure, are urged to call ahead before visiting their GP so staff can take precautions. More information on the measles virus can be found on the Queensland Health website.
