A horse in Shawano county has tested positive for the mosquito-borne virus eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), the Shawano-Menominee county Health Department said [Tue 10 Oct 2017].

The virus is transmitted to humans, horses, birds, and other animals during bites from infected mosquitoes, Health Officer Vicki Dantoin said.

The horse testing positive means there are mosquitoes in the area infected with the virus and can transmit it to people, she said in a statement.

The last EEE case in humans was reported in 2011 and was only the 2nd known case in Wisconsin since 1964, Dantoin said.

Signs of the infection in horses include depression, loss of appetite, drooping eyelids and lower lip, blindness, paralysis, and death. Most people infected with the virus do not have symptoms but some develop inflammation of the brain.

The best way to avoid mosquito-borne diseases is to reduce exposure to mosquitoes and eliminate mosquito breeding sites, Dantoin said.

"Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a member of the genus _Alphavirus_, family Togaviridae. Other medically important alphaviruses found in the Americas include western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV). EEEV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. The virus particles are spherical and have a diameter of 60-65 nm. Of the 4 lineages of EEEV, group I is endemic in North America and the Caribbean and causes most human disease cases; the other 3 groups (IIA, IIB, and III) cause primarily equine illness in Central and South America." (http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/tech/virus.html)

Vaccination is very effective in preventing the viral infection. The vaccine is usually a combination of EEE, WNV, WEE, and sometimes VEE and tetanus. Mosquito control is very important in reducing the mosquitoes, which is another form of helping to protect your horse.

Protection from EEE can wane in approximately 4 months. Areas with high prevalence would be wise to vaccinate every 4 months. - Mod.TG]
