[1] USA: doctor from Sierra Leone dies in Nebraska hospital

A surgeon who contracted Ebola while working in his native Sierra Leone has died while being treated in a biocontainment unit at a Nebraska hospital, the facility said Monday [17 Nov 2014].

Nebraska Medical Center said in a news release that [the doctor] died as a result of the disease. "[He] was extremely critical when he arrived here, and unfortunately, despite out best efforts, we weren't able to save him," said Dr. Phil Smith, medical director of the biocontainment unit. [The doctor] arrived Sat [15 Nov 2014] to be treated at the Omaha hospital, where 2 other Ebola patients have been successfully treated.

The 44-year-old [doctor] had been working as a general surgeon at Kissy United Methodist Hospital in the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown. It's not clear whether he was involved in the care of Ebola patients. Kissy is not an Ebola treatment unit, but Salia worked in at least 3 other facilities, United Methodist News said, citing health ministry sources. [The doctor], a Sierra Leone citizen who lives in Maryland, 1st showed Ebola symptoms on 6 Nov 2014 but tested negative for the virus. He eventually tested positive on 10 Nov 2014.

[The State Department said in a statement it had facilitated [the doctor's] evacuation at the request of his wife, who said she had agreed to reimburse the USA for the expense. The United Methodist Church ... is working to set up a fund for donations to help pay for the medical flight, a church spokeswoman said.

[2] USA: doctor's false negative Ebola test

When [the doctor's] Ebola test came back negative, his friends and colleagues threw their arms around him. They shook his hand. They patted him on the back. They removed their protective gear and cried. But when his symptoms remained nearly a week later, [he] took another test, on 10 Nov 2014. This one came back positive, sending the Sierra Leonean doctor with ties to Maryland on a desperate, belated quest for treatment and forcing the colleagues who had embraced him into quarantine...

Although the United Methodist hospital where [the doctor] worked doesn't treat Ebola, doctors [there] knew that their patients could be infectious. A woman giving birth, a man complaining of abdominal pain, any of them could be carrying the disease. [The doctor] wore gloves but never the full protective gear used in the country's Ebola wards...

The doctors who tended to him in Freetown appeared to be unaware that an early Ebola test -- taken within the 1st 3 days of the illness -- is often inconclusive. In a country where information about the disease continues to move slowly, it was another potentially tragic mistake. In many cases, a negative test at that stage means nothing because "there aren't enough copies of the virus in the blood for the test to pick up," said Ermias Belay, the head of the CDC's Ebola response team in Sierra Leone...

And now, several other [health workers] who interacted closely with [the doctor] are quarantined [for 21 days]. So far, none are symptomatic. But all are frustrated that their celebration of what appeared to be good news ended this way... - more

[The lab that performed the 1st test should not be faulted, for the reason given, but the delay before the 2nd test meant that appropriate treatment was not started early enough to save him, and unlike other medevaced patients, he was too weak to walk from the ambulance to the hospital on arrival in the USA. - Mod.JW]

[3] USA: NYC claiming federal reimbursement for Ebola case

http://nypost.com/2014/11/16/schumer-to-obama-reimburse-nyc-for-20m-ebola-treatment


Senator Charles Schumer wants President Obama to pick up New York City's more than USD 20 million tab for treating its 1st Ebola patient.

Since the Big Apple and Bellevue Hospital treated and cured CS of the "infectious disease that is a threat to the nation," the New York lawmaker believes the government should pony up and reimburse the city.

"Last week, CS thankfully returned home healthy and free of Ebola," Schumer said Sunday [16 Nov 2014]. "But the world-class response mounted by New York City and Bellevue HHC was not free, and the bottom line is local communities and local taxpayers should not foot the whole bill for handling an infectious disease that is a threat to the nation."

The senator said that the city and hospital should be compensated in the same way that communities are compensated following a natural disaster. "Moreover, we must make sure that there is funding available in the future for any city that may handle a confirmed Ebola case," he added.

The proposed "Ebola Contingency Fund" would help control the spread of the deadly virus by establishing a way to properly fund states and localities so they can treat patients. This new plan would be modeled after similar funds, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's federal isolation and quarantine fund for tuberculosis within the Division of Global Migration. This fund sets aside USD one million in federal funding for states and localities to treat possible tuberculosis patients and to also contain the disease. The money also ensures that sufficient resources are available at all times in case federal isolation orders are handed down to quarantine a person.

Around 100 healthcare workers were involved in treating CS while he was isolated at Bellevue, Schumer said. In addition, a 24-hour-a-day operation which employed approximately 500 staffers was established by the city's Health Department to keep track of the estimated 300 people who arrive each day from Ebola hotspots in West Africa. As of right now, the entire state of New York is expected to receive USD 14.6 million of the USD 6.1 billion that the President has requested for Ebola funding. The money would only cover "preparedness activities" and would not account for actual costs involving Ebola treatment and activities focused on preventing its spread.

Schumer's planned "Ebola Fund" was launched in the upcoming Fiscal Year 2015 omnibus bill and is set to be considered during the lame duck session [of Congress].

[4] Ebola songs for fund-raising & prevention
Date: 17 Nov 2014
Source: Washington Post [edited]
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/11/17/listen-the-ebola-song-that-isnt-do-they-know-its-christmas


The new recording of Band Aid's "Do They Know It's Christmas?" already looks set to be a huge hit. Irish singer Bob Geldof, who organized the re-recording to raise funds to fight Ebola, told the BBC on Mon [17 Nov 2014] that pre-sales of the song had been "extraordinary" and had raised millions in just minutes...

Over the years, "Do They Know It's Christmas?" has been the subject of a variety of criticisms, with many people pointing toward the weird, inappropriate lyrics or the patronizing spectacle of so many white, Western artists singing to an amorphous, anonymous group of Africans. And while Geldof has changed the worst of the lyrics for this most recent re-release, there's still only one African artist singing on the track (Angelique Kidjo, a Grammy-winning singer and songwriter from Benin).

There is another option, thankfully, for music fans who worry about Ebola: a song actually written and recorded by West African artists that is also aimed toward a West African audience. Its title? Simply, "Africa Stop Ebola." The track, recorded and released last month [October 2014], has brought together some of the biggest stars from West Africa's rich music scene: Major artists including Ivorian reggae star Tiken Jah Fakoly, Mali's afro-pop singer Salif Keita, and Senegalese rapper Didier Awadi are involved. It is, quite frankly, a better song than its Western equivalent. But more importantly, this is not a song vaguely about Africans in peril. The lyrics were written jointly by the artists and Carlos Chirino of SOAS [School of Oriental & African Studies], University of London. They speak directly to the citizens of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone in a mixture of languages, including French and indigenous languages spoken in the region.

You'll find specific and practical advice in the song: The singers advise listeners to wash their hands and listen to doctors, how to deal with the dead, and other issues. In a situation in which misinformation and fear are some of the biggest problems, this is a pertinent message. The song is also raising money for Doctors Without Borders [MSF], one of the nongovernmental organizations on the ground fighting the disease (you can buy the song on iTunes).

"Africa Stop Ebola" is just one of a number of songs about Ebola produced in West Africa. Earlier this summer [2014], Liberian artists F.A., Soul Fresh and DenG released a Hip Co song that included similar advice on how the disease was spread. That song was created in conjunction with UNICEF, but other local artists have produced their own songs without outside input. That's because for these musicians, Ebola isn't some distant, exotic threat: It's a concern in their real lives, and it directly influences their music... - more

[Band Aid 30, the 2014 update of the Band Aid campaign that raised money for [famine in] Ethiopia in 1984, has raised over GBP 1 million (USD 1.5 million) for Ebola within 5 minutes of being launched. The updated version of "Do They Know It's Christmas?," which features One Direction, Ed Sheeran, Ellie Goulding, and Sam Smith, among others, was recorded in London [UK] on Sat [15 Nov 2014], and the video premiered [on TV] on Sun [16 Nov 2014]'s X Factor http://mashable.com/2014/11/17/band-aid-30-single. - Mod.JW]

Surprisingly, there is great concern about Ebola here in Thailand. Not much on TV, but walking through the airport was reminiscent of the time of avian influenza, when I was also in the region, but the concerns far more justified.

It is encouraging to learn that an Asian country is taking precautions. ProMED would be glad to have firsthand reports from other readers about precautions in other Asian international airports. - Mod.JW]

[6] USA: passengers from Mali screened
Date: 16 Nov 2014

https://news.yahoo.com/us-screen-travelers-mali-ebola-220329290.html


Travelers from Mali will be subject to the same screening and monitoring that was ordered for people arriving from 3 other Ebola-affected countries, U.S. health officials said Sunday [16 Nov 2014].

Mali is not suffering widespread Ebola illnesses, but federal officials are growing increasingly worried about a new cluster of 7 illnesses in Mali that have left public health workers scrambling to track and monitor [more than 440] other people who may have had contact with the 7 people and may be at risk.

"At this point, we can't be confident that every exposed person has been identified, or that every identified person is being monitored daily," said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC].

Starting Mon [17 Nov 2014], anyone arriving in the USA from Mali will undergo the same screening procedures that were ordered last month [October 2014] for travelers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. That includes taking arriving travelers' temperatures and questioning them about their health and possible exposure to the Ebola virus. They also will be asked to provide contact information and to agree to have daily communications with local health officials -- for 21 days -- who will be asking them to take their temperatures twice each day and monitoring them to see whether they develop symptoms.

West Africa is currently suffering the worst Ebola epidemic in world history, with at least 14 000 illnesses and more than 5100 deaths so far. Nearly all of the cases have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. About 75 people arrive from those 3 countries each day, on average. They are funneled through 5 airports, 2 in New York and one each in Washington, Chicago and Atlanta. In contrast, only about 15 to 20 passengers arrive from Mali to the United States on an average day. The majority end up arriving through the same 5 airports. But in the next few days, steps will be taken to make sure all funnel through those airports, Frieden said... - more
