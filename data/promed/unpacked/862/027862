Case of yellow fever in monkeys is confirmed in Tocantins
---------------------------------------------------------
6 monkey death events have been recorded by the State Department of Health (SESAU) [earlier] this year [2015] in Tocantins. Yellow fever, however, was only confirmed in 1 of the 5 animals that died in Porto Nacional, 66 km [about 41 miles] from Palmas in April [2015]. In Palmas [the state capital], the City Department of Health (SEMUS) said 8 primates died this week [week ending 31 Jul 2015] and tests are currently being done.

According to SESAU, the primates were found dead in Porto Nacional. They were in a forested corridor of the Sao Joao river, in the urban* area of the city. In the capital, samples are being analyzed and 8 dead animals were located in block 604 South, according to SEMUS. SESAU points out that each death event corresponds to not only one animal.

In 2014, primates died in Ames, Dianopolis, Gurupi, Peixe and Taguatinga, but yellow fever was confirmed only in Taguatinga. "The death serves as a warning and it could be that the virus is circulating. From these events investigation follows," said the SESAU yellow fever and dengue manager, Christiane Bueno.

The Secretariat noted that "Tocantins is endemic for this disease, characterized by a seasonal period of 7 [outbreaks] in 7 years, when the occurrence of non-human primate deaths (monkeys) is most evident." According to data from the Secretariat, between 2007 and 2014, 79 monkey deaths were recorded in the state.

[*The Sao Joao river does in fact flow right through the city and is heavily forested between the suburbs of Universitario and Palestina just north of the airport, as can be seen on Google Earth: https://www.google.com/maps/@-10.7094713,-48.3930984,3772m/data=!3m1!1e3. So there is a threat to the city. - Mod.JW]

[A dengue epidemic was declared in Tocantins state in early May of this year (2015) (ProMED-mail archive no. 20150510.3352790), a clear indication that _Aedes aegypti_, the vector mosquito of both dengue and yellow fever viruses, was abundant in the state. That underscores the risk of spill over from the sylvan transmission cycle involving monkeys, to urban spread involving humans, as occurred in Paraguay in 2008 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20080308.0949). Other monkey deaths were reported last year (2014) in Tocantins (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140718.2618993). In May 2014 skeletons of a howler, a capuchin monkey and a marmoset monkey were found in Almas, Tocantins state. On 7 Jul 2014, another howler monkey skeleton was found in Taguatinga (also in Tocantins). It is essential that immunity be maintained in a high proportion of humans in the area by ongoing vaccination to prevent a serious outbreak. So far, no human cases have occurred in the monkey outbreak reported above.
