More than 3000 endangered Saiga antelopes have died in a suspected
epidemic in Kazakhstan, an environmental official said on Monday [24 May 2010].

So far, 3271 of the small antelopes have been found dead, an
agriculture ministry official, Akhmetzhan Sultanov, told journalists,
cited by Interfax-Kazakhstan.

The animals appear to have died from an infectious disease,
pasteurellosis, Mr Sultanov said [see comment]. The often deadly
infection strikes the lungs and intestines and needs to be treated
with antibiotics.

A ministry official said last week that the investigators initially
believed the animals had been poisoned.

Saiga antelopes, which have distinctive bulbous noses, are listed as
a critically endangered species by WWF, with an estimated population
of 50 000. The Kazakh agriculture ministry puts the country's
population at 81 000 antelopes, however.

Saiga migrate between Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Mongolia,
Turkmenistan and China. The number of Saiga fell drastically after
the collapse of the Soviet Union, due to uncontrolled hunting and
demand for their horns in Chinese medicine.

[Before incriminating _Pasteurella_ as the primary etiological agent
of the described mass mortality in Kazakhi Saiga antelopes, other
pathogens, in particular FMD virus, should be excluded; bacterial
pneumonia could be secondary, with _Pasteurella_ being a likely candidate.

Pneumonia was seen also in earlier FMD outbreaks in antelopes,
including a major outbreak in Saiga antelopes in Kazakhstan (see
commentary and references in posting 20100522.1702).

During an extensive FMD outbreak seen in wild mountain gazelles in
Israel in 1985 [Veterinary Record (1986) 119, 175-176], oral and
podal lesions were seen, in some cases leading to separation of
hooves and loss of horns. Macroscopic muscular lesions were observed
in the heart of most animals examined, as well as in the diaphragmal,
lingual and other skeletal muscles. In some cases, slight but
distinct lesions were seen on omasal folds. Other common changes
included pneumonia, but due to biosecurity considerations, no
bacteriological examinations were allowed. Most animals examined were
in excellent nutritional condition, indicating that the course of the
disease was peracute. Some animals, although adjacent to water,
manifested severe dehydration. This was probably because of an
inability to drink caused by lingual muscular changes. FMD virus type
0 was isolated from the mouth and foot lesions as well as from a
sample of affected heart muscle. Similar mortality and lesions were
observed in experimental infection trials in gazelles performed
subsequently with the same virus strain. - Mod.AS]
