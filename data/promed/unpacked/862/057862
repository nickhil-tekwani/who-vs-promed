When a Lexington-area spike in foal deaths caused by nocardioform placentitis 1st hit the news at the end of January [2020], there was considerable anecdotal chatter in the Bluegrass region that the number of equine abortions, stillborns, and neonate euthanizations might be higher than what is being reported by the University of Kentucky Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (UKVDL), the main entity that tracks such cases.

Two weeks ago, when TDN 1st reported on the outbreak, the number stood at 44. As of Thursday [13 Feb 2020] afternoon, Kentucky's nocardioform placentitis death toll was 65. They are all Thoroughbreds, and the casualties continue to be clustered around Lexington.

Dr. Craig Carter, the director of the UKVDL, confirmed to TDN in a phone interview that those casualty totals are, in fact, likely to be higher.

The reasons are twofold. Nocardioform placentitis is not mandated as a reportable agricultural disease. There is also a time lag involved in the period between when a specimen is voluntarily delivered to the lab for testing and when the results appear on the UKVDL's county-by-county interactive map tracking the outbreak (http://vdl.uky.edu:8080/informer/DashboardViewer.html?locale=en_US&embedToken=c67e307c-b90c-4256-9427-8afae2438c93). That map is a useful tool, but the UKVDL never intended for it to represent a complete, real-time picture of the disease.

However, Carter said he has no doubt the UKVDL is compiling and making available enough data for veterinarians and farm personnel to use to increase their awareness and vigilance of nocardioform placentitis, which currently has no known cure or preventative measures.

"I've been here 15 years in the trenches doing the diagnostic testing, and I feel really confident we are getting enough specimens from the field to where we can put out the appropriate alerts," Carter said. "And that's really all we can do. Here in the lab, all we can do is confirm a specific diagnosis, and then go back to the veterinarians in the field and say, 'Here's what you've got.'"

Nocardioform placentitis is a group of organisms causing separation of the placenta from the mare's uterus. It stops nutrients and oxygen getting from the mare to the fetus, which can damage and be life-threatening to the foal. Foals can either be stillborn or born in a weakened state requiring euthanization. Some diseased foals can be born normally and mature healthily in cases where mares have only a small lesion caused by the disease.

Nocardioform placentitis has thus far stumped equine epidemiologists, because they don't know how it gets into the mares. It is believed to be either soil- or environment-based, and it seems to spike in the foaling seasons after periods of dry, hot weather in late summer and early fall.

The disease is almost exclusively confined to the Bluegrass region of Kentucky, and cases of it most recently spiked in the 2011 and 2017 foaling seasons. The University of Kentucky's Gluck Equine Research Center has studied nocardioform placentitis extensively but has been unable to reproduce the disease by inoculating mares with the organisms.

"I want to emphasize that it's a rare disease," Carter said. "It's an unusual bug. It's not seen much outside the Bluegrass area. There are very few places in the world having ever seen anything quite like these nocardioform organisms. I've heard Florida has reported a couple and maybe Texas might have diagnosed a couple this year [2020]. But why is it focused here, and what is its drought relationship?"

"All I can say is if you look at the scientific literature, there is very little known about this particular bug, and so that just makes it tougher," Carter continued. "Most of the diseases we deal with here, we're well aware of them. But this one here has never really been seen at all outside of the Bluegrass region."

Carter explained the UKVDL's role in combatting nocardioform placentitis.

"We [compile the database and map] for situational awareness, basically," Carter said "But it's only based on what people send to us, so it has its limitation."

Carter added that one diagnostic positive is that, unlike in other agricultural settings, the lofty economics of the Thoroughbred breeding industry provide a strong, built-in incentive for farm personnel to want to report these types of diseases.

"In Kentucky's horse industry, when horses are sick and they're dying, [owners and breeders] want to know what's going on," Carter said. "So, we get [reports] of a very high percentage of the problems going on. The horse industry is pretty sensitive. A lot of animal agriculture is tightly clustered in eastern Kentucky, so we get a lot more [sampling] than you would in other states. We're kind of fortunate in that way, because we really want to know what is going on out there."

When a farm has a suspected nocardioform placentitis case resulting in a casualty, the UKVDL becomes aware of it when farm personnel or their veterinarian bring in a dead fetus or a placenta for testing. "We can diagnose it from either specimen," Carter said. "They give a clinical history of what's going on with the farm, and we do the work [to generate] a diagnosis, and then the information goes in the database," which has controls to maintain client privacy.

Carter said the UKVDL recognizes that, for some smaller-scale farm owners, the cost of testing could be a disincentive for them to bring in specimens.

"We actually try our very, very best to keep all the prices for our tests relating to the post-mortem as low as we can," Carter said. "We do have to charge a fee to keep our doors open. But we work really hard to keep those fees low, so people are encouraged to bring their animals in and get a diagnosis."

Although Carter didn't have all the details, he believes the Gluck Equine Research Center is in the process of getting funding approved so specimen testing kits can be made available to farm personnel for free, which has been done during past nocardioform placentitis outbreaks.

"So the test kits will kind of help solve the problem being talked about where people are saying, 'This is a lot worse than everybody thinks it is,'" Carter explained. "If we go out and do more surveillance and we test more specimens, it should help either validate the statement or not. The last time the free kits were made available, I think it about doubled the number of specimens we were able to look at. That's a good thing. And it's something we want to do, because it's our mission."

While they wait for researchers, such as the team at Gluck, to achieve new breakthroughs, Carter said they work to "increase the surveillance for the disease, and it's what we're in the progress of doing. Right now, it looks like it could come close to being as big of a problem as it was in 2010-2011."

Asked about his prediction for the direction this year's outbreak of nocardioform placentitis might take, Carter said he expects it to follow historical, season-related patterns.

"It usually does tail off," Carter said. "Spikes [have previously resolved] to bell curves."

[The most common cause of late-term abortion in mares is placentitis, a term describing an inflammation of the placenta. A common type of placentitis results from environmental bacteria ascending though the vagina and cervix. Signs of this infection, known as ascending placentitis, are early mammary development and lactation as well as a discharge from the vagina. Ascending placentitis causes lesions around the cervical star, and bacteria also affect the placenta and fetal fluids, infecting the foal.

Nocardioform placentitis is somewhat less common. Caused by specific types of bacteria called actinomycetes, nocardioform placentitis affects only the interface between the placenta and the uterine lining, the lower part of the uterine body, and the base of the uterine horn. The fetus itself is not infected, but because the infection interferes with nutritional support from the placenta, the foal is either aborted or is born undersized and underdeveloped.

[_Nocardia_ is a genus of weakly staining Gram-positive, catalase-positive, rod-shaped bacteria. It forms partially acid-fast beaded branching filaments. It contains a total of 85 species. Some species are nonpathogenic, while others are responsible for nocardiosis. Actinomycetes is a type of bacteria. However, this situation in the mares is called nordio-form, because it does have actinomycetes associated with the situation, but it does not produce the disease nocardiosis. Hence, nocardioform is the descriptive term for the type of placentitis. - Mod.TG]

When a mare shows signs of placentitis, a veterinarian can use transabdominal or transrectal ultrasound to differentiate between the types of infection. Affected mares can be treated with antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medications, and a high dose of a progestin-like hormone. Early treatment reduces the number of abortions, and most foals can survive.

In an average foaling season, a few cases of nocardioform placentitis are usually seen, but occasionally there is an upswing in cases with several hundred mares affected. Such a surge occurred in Kentucky in the spring of 2011, triggering new research into the causes of the disease.

At the University of Kentucky, groups of mares were given oral doses of nocardioform actinomycetes, had the bacteria injected directly into the bloodstream, were given an intranasal spray containing the bacteria, or had their uteri inoculated with the bacteria, either at the time of breeding or at day 270 of gestation. None of these mares developed placentitis, making it difficult to determine the route of infection. Mats Troedsson, a study leader, commented the bacteria associated with nocardioform placentitis are fairly harmless in most instances. Therefore, it is possible some factor in the mare or in the environment changes, making the bacteria harmful.
