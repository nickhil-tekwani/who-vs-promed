[LSD has been spreading in several east Mediterranean countries since mid-2012; see an updated interactive map showing all outbreaks reported so far in the region at http://tinyurl.com/opmpanr (click on the cluster, and zoom in). The absence of marked outbreaks in Syria reflects an absence of reporting not an absence of disease (the virus has certainly not circumvented this tragically war-stricken country).

On top of the outbreaks reported by Iraq's Veterinary Services to the OIE, LSD has been observed also in Iraq's Kurdistan region (see 2013 archived post 20140124.2228577). Information on the vaccine-strain applied in Iraq will be appreciated.

In view of the reported LSD spread to southeast Turkey and Kurdistan, enhanced surveillance in northwest Iran seems desirable. Renewed spread of the virus, which is vector-borne, may be expected during 2014's spring season. - Mod.AS
