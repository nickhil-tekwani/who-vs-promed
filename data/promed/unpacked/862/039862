Zimbabwe:Anthrax outbreak hits Matabeleland again
---------------------------
An anthrax outbreak has been reported in Lupane District in
Matabeleland North where several cattle have died, Chronicle learnt yesterday.
The Department of Veterinary Services officials told Chronicle at the
Zimbabwe International Trade Fair that the disease was reported in
some parts of Lupane 3 weeks ago. "Some officers went to Lupane
yesterday (Tuesday) for a vaccination campaign programme," said the official.
The Bulawayo Veterinary Officer, Dr Ndabezinhle Mkhwananzi was quick
to mention that a vaccination programme was under way in parts of
Matabeleland North but declined to confirm the outbreak. "We are
taking measures to contain any anthrax outbreak cases through
vaccinating the cattle for a minimum of 3 years," he said.
Dr Mkhwananzi said animal diseases were increasing because of heavy
rains received this year. He said his office was focusing on
educating farmers on better methods of livestock production.

[Anthrax has unfortunately been a chronic problem in Matabeleland for
many years now and this reflects the ongoing deficiencies in the
veterinary control programme. Instead of being proactive it now
reacts to outbreaks as and when they are discovered, and when there
are funds available. - Mod.MHJ]
