Ministry of Health announces continuing decline in MERS cases
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health announced a continuing decline in Corona virus infections for the 4th consecutive week. In its weekly statement, the Ministry reported there were only 3 confirmed cases recorded in Mecca, Riyadh and Hail during the period from [5 to 11 Apr 2015], compared with the 31 cases from the same period last year [2014].

The Ministry confirmed that despite the significant reduction in the number of cases, however, we are still in season. As a result, the Ministry remains committed to continuing preparations, cooperative efforts with other parties, including the Saudi community and healthcare staff, as well as increasing health awareness through a dedicated awareness campaign against Corona virus.

According to the Ministry, during the same period, 1336 samples were tested for Corona virus in MoH laboratories across the Kingdom. Also, the number of rapid response team visits to medical facilities regarding infection prevention and control was 7, while the total number of visits of public health teams to positive, direct contact cases was 2. The numbers of positive, direct contact cases at home is 12. In the same context, the Ministry announced 543 cases from the total of 977 confirmed cases have been cured, a rate of 55.5 percent.

The Ministry of Health's Command and Control Center (CCC) ensures the commitment of all government and private healthcare facilities in applying infection control procedures based on international best practices derived from coordination with relevant government and international health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO). The CCC will continue all efforts related to combatting Corona virus, including epidemiological monitoring, 24/7.

[4] Saudi Arabia - serosurvey

Saudi serology study shows possible role for silent MERS infections
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A large study of blood samples in Saudi Arabia suggests that some people who have contact with camels can contract undiagnosed or only mild MERS-CoV infections and might unknowingly pass the disease to others, findings that may help solve the mystery of how some people are getting sick.

The long-awaited seroprevalence study by a German and Saudi research team also found that camel shepherds and slaughterhouse workers had antibodies against the virus that were 15 to 23 times higher than the general population, adding more evidence that camels are a natural host for the virus.

The group, which included Christian Drosten, MD, a virologist at the University of Bonn, and Ziad Memish, MD, with King Abdulaziz Medical City and Alfaisal University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, published their findings yesterday [8 Apr 2015] in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

Drosten hinted at the study's main findings in an interview with Science that was published [20 Mar 2015].

Also, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health (MOH) reported one new case, and the World Health Organization (WHO) posted an update on 12 recent MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) cases from the country. [See ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV (37): Saudi Arabia, new cases, WHO 20150409.3287570 for details on these reports/cases. - Mod.MPP]

Serology study fills in more gaps
---------------------------------
The German and Saudi team's work is the 1st nationwide population-based seroepidemiologic study of MERS-CoV. Using a cross-sectional study design, they tested blood samples from 10 009 people in Saudi Arabia whose age and sex profile are similar to the country's general population.

They also looked at blood samples from camel shepherds and slaughterhouse workers.

The blood samples they used had been obtained for other public health purposes, about 5700 from primary health clinics collected in April through June of 2013 and about 4200 between December 2012 and December 2013 from primary health centers.

The collection included samples from all 13 of Saudi Arabia's provinces. The investigators found MERS-CoV antibodies in 15 people, or 0.15 percent. Men were more likely to have signs of infection than women, and researchers saw no age-related patterns. Positive findings were more common in central rural areas than in coastal regions -- 14 of the positive samples were from central rural residents, and 1 was from a coastal district.

The team also obtained samples from 87 camel shepherds who participated in a health ministry surveillance study in the first half of 2014 and from 140 foreign slaughterhouse employees working in Mecca in August 2013. Two shepherds and 5 slaughterhouse workers had MERS-CoV antibodies, for rates of 2.3 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively.

None of the people who had MERS-CoV antibodies had severe infection when they were sampled, and the age of those who seroconverted was lower than in patients who have been admitted to the hospital for the disease.

The team concluded that middle-aged men who have regular contact with camels may sporadically transmit the virus to the general population, and the subclinical or mild infections -- especially in younger people -- might be the source of unknown sources of exposure reported for many MERS patients.

The researchers noted that antibodies were seen across a wide part of Saudi Arabia, even in areas that haven't reported outbreaks. Extrapolating their findings to the general population, they estimated that as many as 44 951 people in Saudi Arabia may have MERS-CoV antibodies, though Drosten in last month's Science story called the extrapolation "a bit risky."

Study clarifies patterns, but questions remain
----------------------------------------------
In a commentary on the study in the same issue, 2 infectious disease experts wrote that the study is the 1st well-designed, credible seroepidemiologic study of MERS-CoV, and that evidence is building that dromedary camels are the natural host. The authors are Ghazi Kayali, PhD, MPH, a virologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, and Malik Peiris, PhD, a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong.

Camels' role has been controversial, because many sick people had no contact with them, case-control studies haven't been done, and an earlier seroprevalence study in people who had contact with camels found no association.

The 2 experts, though, said the study findings suggest that young Saudi Arabian men who have occupational or cultural contact with camels are contracting the virus, often without being diagnosed, and introducing the virus to the general population, where the more severe cases are prompting testing and identification.

The group's study paints a clearer picture of disease epidemiology, Kayali and Peiris wrote. "Camels seem to be a natural host for MERS-CoV, and transmission within camel herds is well established."

They said several questions still need to be resolved, however, such as how camels are infecting people, whether an intermediate host is carrying the virus between camels and people, and if dromedaries are the natural reservoir or an amplifier host.

"Summary
"Background
"Scientific evidence suggests that dromedary camels are the intermediary host for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, the actual number of infections in people who have had contact with camels is unknown and most index patients cannot recall any such contact. We aimed to do a nationwide serosurvey in Saudi Arabia to establish the prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies, both in the general population and in populations of individuals who have maximum exposure to camels.

"Methods
"In the cross-sectional serosurvey, we tested human serum samples obtained from healthy individuals older than 15 years who attended primary health-care centres or participated in a national burden-of-disease study in all 13 provinces of Saudi Arabia. Additionally, we tested serum samples from shepherds and abattoir workers with occupational exposure to camels. Samples were screened by recombinant ELISA and MERS-CoV seropositivity was confirmed by recombinant immunofluorescence and plaque reduction neutralisation tests. We used 2-tailed Mann Whitney U exact tests, chi squares, and Fisher's exact tests to analyse the data.

"Findings
"Between [1 Dec 2012], and [1 Dec 2013], we obtained individual serum samples from 10 009 individuals. Anti-MERS-CoV antibodies were confirmed in 15 (0·15 percent; 95 percent CI [confidence intervals] 0·09-0·24) of 10 009 people in 6 of the 13 provinces. The mean age of seropositive individuals was significantly younger than that of patients with reported, laboratory-confirmed, primary Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (43·5 years [SD 17·3] vs 53·8 years [17·5]; p=0·008). Men had a higher antibody prevalence than did women (11 [0·25 percent] of 4341 vs 2 [0·05 percent] of 4378; p=0·028) and antibody prevalence was significantly higher in central versus coastal provinces (14 [0·26 percent] of 5479 vs one [0·02 percent] of 4529; p=0·003). Compared with the general population, seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies was significantly increased by 15 times in shepherds (2 [2·3 percent] of 87, p=0·0004) and by 23 times in slaughterhouse workers (5 [3·6 percent] of 140; p less than 0·0001).

"Interpretation
"Seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies was significantly higher in camel-exposed individuals than in the general population. By simple multiplication, a projected 44 951 (95 percent CI 26 971-71 922) individuals older than 15 years might be seropositive for MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia. These individuals might be the source of infection for patients with confirmed MERS who had no previous exposure to camels."

In an editorial comment, Kayali and Peiris summarize the findings: "In the Lancet Infectious Diseases, Marcel Muller and colleagues present the 1st, well designed, credible, population-based seroepidemiological study of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia." (see Kayali G, Peiris M. A more detailed picture of the epidemiology of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Lancet Infect Dis. 2015 Apr 8. pii: S1473-3099(15)70128-3. doi: 10.1016/S1473-3099(15)70128-3. available at http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2815%2970128-3/abstract)

This is a long awaited study of a baseline prevalence of evidence of prior MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia. The period covered by this study is one year from 1 Dec 2013 through 1 Dec 2014, during which time there were approximately 700 laboratory-confirmed cases (confirmation via PCR studies of sputum or bronchial washings) associated with exposure in Saudi Arabia (reconstructing reported cases using my line listings based on data reported by the MOH, WHO, FluTrackers and other media reports). Hence, the seroprevalence study was done during a period of time with known MERS-CoV transmission ongoing in Saudi Arabia. The increased seroprevalence among individuals with known occupational exposure to camels was significantly higher than that seen in the general population. Of note is the projection of 44 951 individuals older than age 15 years who were most likely infected by MERS-CoV during that period (infection defined as evidence of seropositivity). If that estimate is close to reality, then the estimated case fatality rate in Saudi Arabia would be significantly less than observed through case reporting -- approximately 2 percent. - Mod.MPP]
