Another 14 cases of measles have been confirmed in the Lower Mainland that
are linked to an outbreak that began in March [2010]. As of 15 Apr 2010, a
total of 44 cases have been reported across British Columbia [BC], with 7
new [cases] in both the Fraser and Vancouver Coastal health regions.

"We're seeing a lot of cases in people who are either unimmunized or they
have an unknown immunization history," said Ritinder Harry, spokesperson
for the BC Centre for Disease Control. A total of 17 people in Fraser
Health have now tested positive for measles, plus 17 more in Vancouver
Coastal. There are usually very few, if any, cases of measles in BC.

But the refusal of some people to have their children vaccinated is making
pockets of the population more vulnerable to diseases that were thought to
have been virtually eradicated in North America.

Ritinder Harry is reminding people to vaccinate their children against
measles at age one year and 18 months. She said adults not sure about their
own status should check their immunization records. One Vancouver school
has sent unvaccinated students home for 3 weeks after several students
there came down with measles. The measles outbreak is thought to have
arrived here with at least 2 foreign visitors during the Olympics.

The illness causes fever, runny nose, and a cough. A rash develops later,
often accompanied by sore, red eyes and light sensitivity. It may also
cause ear infections, pneumonia and, in rare cases, encephalitis, deafness,
brain damage or death.

There are also 7 reported cases in the interior, 2 in the north and one on
Vancouver Island.

King County health officials are warning that a woman who has measles
visited Seattle earlier this month [April 2010]. The woman was visiting
from British Columbia, where there have been 44 confirmed measles cases.
The woman was at the Seattle Aquarium from 3 to 7 pm on 3 Apr 2010.

The risk may be low here because many are vaccinated against the disease.
Those born before 1957 probably had the disease. But people who aren't
vaccinated are at high risk, and that includes children who are one or
younger. They are too young to be vaccinated. Pregnant women and people
with weakened immune systems are at risk even if they have been vaccinated.
If you are in this group and develop an illness with fever or unexplained
rash, call your doctor.

Health officials said people who might have [contracted] measles in this
case would be expected to develop a rash between 10 and 24 Apr 2010.

[This importation of measles virus infection into British Columbia around
the time of the Winter Olympics in Vancouver is continuing to reveal
susceptible members of the community who are unprotected by prior vaccination.

A British Columbian resident visiting Seattle has triggered an alert in
neighbouring Washington state, but no transmission of measles virus
infection has been recorded so far.
