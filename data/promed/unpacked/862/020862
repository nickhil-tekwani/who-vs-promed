A recent outbreak of late blight in UK tomato crops is likely to be a new strain, as symptoms have been seen early in the season on young plants. Some existing plant protection controls are proving ineffective due to the apparent aggressiveness of this strain.

The limited number of applications allowed for authorised protective and curative products for the disease during the growing season is also causing concern for growers, due to its early appearance.

AHDB [Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board] has responded quickly to the outbreak and will be conducting a trial to identify new potential options to control the strain. Cathryn Lambourne, AHDB, said: "We were alerted to the issue in young plants in late March [2018], the disease was confirmed and the genotype identified at The James Hutton Institute. We are working quickly to raise awareness of the emerging problem."

Symptoms of the new strain include brown stem lesions that start just above the graft union and spread along affected stems.

[Late blight of tomato and potato is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 per cent crop loss. The pathogen can also affect some other solanaceous crops. In tomato, it causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems, and fruits; in potato, it affects leaves as well as tubers. The disease is favoured by cool, moist conditions. It can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

The pathogen is spread by plant material (including tomato transplants, potato seed tubers, plant debris, and volunteer crop plants), mechanical means (including human and insect activities), wind, and water. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen reservoirs, crop rotation, preventive fungicide treatments of planting material, and fungicide sprays of crops. Certified clean planting stock and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are considered vital to control late blight outbreaks. Commercial crop cultivars vary in susceptibility to late blight. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen.

Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide. Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different pathogen strains has been observed, but more virulent strains with additional fungicide resistances and increased yield losses are emerging frequently. In Europe, regional differences in pathogen population diversity no longer exist and increasingly virulent strains have been reported to emerge, mainly on potato (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).
