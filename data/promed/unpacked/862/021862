Since 2 Nov 2018, the Argentine Republic has been facing an outbreak of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), the most recent cases occurring on [7 Feb 2019]. There have been 34 confirmed cases and 12 case-fatalities. The initial spillover occurred in Epuyen, province of Chubut, in the Andean region. Additional cases have been reported in the Rio Negro province; one exported case has also been reported in Chile.

The Andes virus (ANDV, genus Orthohantavirus, family Hantaviridae) has been confirmed as the etiological agent. Its most common host reservoir is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_). Transmission from rodent to human usually occurs through close contact with infected urine and excretions. Secondary, human-to-human infections are considered rare but may occur through direct contact with infected saliva, urine, or blood.

A Consortium including the "Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud, ANLIS, Dr. Carlos G. Malbran" (ANLIS), the Governmental Secretary of Health of Argentina, the Ministry of Health of the Province of Chubut, the Ministry of Health of the Province of Rio Negro, and the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) utilized next-generation sequencing technologies to quickly characterize and analyze ANDV transmission patterns. Advanced bait-enrichment methods were applied to recover genomic information directly from clinical samples so as to avoid changes occurring during in-vitro cell culture.

A total of 28 samples are being analyzed. To date, 12 samples have been processed, yielding 11 coding-complete genomes.

Preliminary phylogenetic analysis suggests the variants belong to "Sur" Andes virus genotype. The closest available relative for the S segment (most used gene in molecular epidemiology characterization for Hantavirus) is the "Andes virus strain AH-1" (S Segment; GenBank accession number AF324902). The level of variation observed between the sequences of the current outbreak is minimal (99.9%), as it would be expected from human-to-human transmission. Given that these 11 complete genomes were obtained from well-established linked cases and also based on the low rodent abundance detected in the area, it is possible to rule out a rodent super-spreader event.

The Consortium continues to process the remaining samples, seeking to obtain a detailed map of the transmission routes for the outbreak. The genomic, laboratorial and epidemiological data will be released in public databases shortly.

This work is part of ongoing research collaborations between several partners:
Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud (ANLIS) "Dr. Carlos G. Malbran"
US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID)
Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Infecciosas (INEI), ANLIS, "Dr. Carlos G. Malbran"
Governmental Secretary of Health of Argentina
Ministry of Health of the Province of Chubut
Ministry of Health of the Province of Río Negro

Data availability: Genome sequences for all samples have been shared with all local and international partners working in Argentina. USAMRIID/ANLIS will distribute these data to any entity or collaborator that need it.

Please contact Dr. Claudia Perandones and/or Dr. Gustavo Palacios for further coordination.

[There have been 3 additional cases since the last ProMED-mail post bringing the total case count to 34. It is interesting to see the initial results of phylogenetic analysis becoming available so soon after the cases occurred. The minimal genotypic variation provides additional evidence of person to person transmission of the virus in this unusual outbreak. However, as noted previously, person to person transmission has happened before.

Mod.PMB provided a reference that indicates that in 1996, there was an outbreak of Andes virus Epilink/96 variant in El Bolson, Rio Negro province, and that, starting with the index case, a molecular analysis indicated that 15 cases occurred subsequently. Of these 16 patients, 9 died. Of the total cases, 8 probably became infected in a hospital environment, including 5 physicians (3 died) and a receptionist in a private clinic where 4 more cases occurred. The receptionist died. The data in this study suggest the possible existence of 3- and 4-person transmission chains, assuming that only one rodent-to-human transmission event occurred.

The progression of the current outbreak can be seen in the ProMED-mail posts listed below.

ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Palacios and colleagues for providing this early information. Results of phylogenetic analysis of the additional samples are awaited with interest. - Mod.TY
