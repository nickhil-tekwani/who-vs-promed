After reporting 26 human H5N1 avian influenza cases in 2013, by far the most of any country, the Kingdom of Cambodia has announced its 1st case of the lethal bird flu in 2014, according to a Ministry of Health press release on Tue 4 Feb 2014.

The case is a 5 year old boy from Chongda village, Tbaung Kropeur commune, Santuk district, Kampong Thom province, who presented with fever and headache on 24 Jan 2014. His condition worsened, and he was admitted to Jayavarman VII Hospital, Siem Reap, on 30 Jan 2014. He was given Tamiflu [oseltamivir] the next day. Testing by L'Institut Pasteur du Cambodge confirmed the presence of H5N1 avian influenza virus. He is currently in a stable condition.

The investigation into the case revealed that some 200 chickens had died suddenly in mid-January [2014], some of which were prepared for food. In addition, the boy had exposure to the affected area. This case represents the 48th human H5N1 avian influenza case in Cambodia since the 1st case was seen in 2005.

[According to the WHO table of the cumulative number of confirmed human cases of avian influenza in Cambodia, there have been 47 cases of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection in Cambodia since the 1st cases were reported to the WHO in 2003, 33 of whom died http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/EN_GIP_20131210CumulativeNumberH5N1cases.pdf?ua=1%3E. More than half of the cases were recorded in 2013, in contrast to most other countries, where H5N1 cases have been declining. It is not clear why this has occurred. - Mod.CP
