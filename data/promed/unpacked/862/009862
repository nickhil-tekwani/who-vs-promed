Russia: measles in Novosibirsk may have been introduced from Kazakhstan
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Seventeen cases of measles have been recorded in Novosibirsk, 13 of which
have been confirmed by serological analysis. Local physicians believe that
cases of measles are coming from Kazakhstan where there is currently an
outbreak of the disease. Last week about 420 cases of measles were
registered in Kazakhstan.
According to the Novosibirsk Public Health department, they are currently
conducting additional immunization against measles. People who are at
occupational or social risk are being given priority for vaccination --
these are 4810 medical providers and 5190 students, who are living in
hostels. Money has been allocated in the city budget to buy sufficient vaccine.
According to epidemiologists, currently in Novosibirsk and in the Russia
Federation as a whole, the disease situation is unstable. Analysis of
records for the past 15 years has revealed relatively low rates of measles:
in 1993 there were 1177 cases, in 2003 there were 3 cases, and in 2004 none.
Epidemiologists predict a rise in measles every 4-5 years, which would
explain the current rise. Vaccination helps to prevent outbreaks of the
disease. In Novosibirsk all children are vaccinated. The Public Health
Department plans to eradicate measles by the year 2010. The plan
anticipates vaccinating everyone under the age of 35. The Novosibirsk
Public Health Department considers that the 10 000 doses of vaccine
available today will be sufficient to prevent epidemics of measles in the city.
