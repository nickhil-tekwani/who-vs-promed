Ohio and federal health officials are investigating an outbreak of 23 cases
of invasive Group A [streptococcal disease in the Cincinnati area that has
led to two deaths and can develop into flesh-eating disease [necrotizing
fasciitis. So far, a total of 63 cases have been reported in Ohio between
1 Jan and 29 Feb 2000. [This is 24 more [cases than [were reported in
all of 1999.
Most of the Greater Cincinnati cases of invasive Group A _Streptococcus_ -
the serious form of [streptococcal throat infections - have led to toxic
shock, a massive infection that can cause organ failure. But a few of the
cases have developed into necrotizing fasciitis, the so-called flesh-eating
disease that destroys muscle, fat and skin tissue, health officials said.
The Ohio Department of Health and the [US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention are examining the cluster of invasive [streptococcal disease
cases in Greater Cincinnati for a common link. At least two people in
Hamilton County - both of whom suffered from toxic shock - have died of
invasive [streptococcal infections, health officials said.
Few people who are exposed to the bacteria develop serious illness, health
officials said. It causes mild skin infections or [streptococcal sore
throat in some people, but makes others seriously ill for unknown reasons.
Health officials and area hospitals have known about the outbreak for at
least two weeks. The public was not informed because little can be done to
ward off the bacteria and its onset is so rapid people become seriously ill
with few symptoms, said Dr. Malcolm Adcock, Cincinnati health commissioner.
The 23 Greater Cincinnati cases represent a dramatic increase from the
three to five cases typically expected in the area during the same period
each year. A CDC team is in Cincinnati studying the outbreak to determine
if the victims had anything in common and spread the
infection among themselves. The investigators have not yet found any
obvious links, Adcock said.
Invasive Group A [streptococcal disease is spread through direct contact
with mucus from the nose or throat or contact with an open wound or sore on
the skin of an infected person, health officials said. It is not an
airborne bacterium, but it can be spread by someone coughing or sneezing on
a hand and passing it to another person. Cultures of the bacteria are being
collected from victims in the Cincinnati area and being sent to federal
health laboratories for analysis.

[It is unclear from this news report how many of the 63 cases that have
occurred this year are serious forms of streptococcal disease. The second
paragraph implies that most of them were streptococcal toxic shock disease,
but that may simply be referring to the most serious cases. I could find
nothing about this situation on the Ohio Department of Health website. It
is not entirely clear why some streptococcal infections progress to serious
invasive infections, while others do not. It is likely that both host
immunocompetence and bacterial virulence factors play a role.
ProMED-mail would appreciate more technical information about this
outbreak. - Mod.ES
