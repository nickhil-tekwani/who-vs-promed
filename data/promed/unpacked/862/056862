Utah public health officials are investigating a few cases of sickness associated with raw or unpasteurized milk. So far, 45 cases of campylobacteriosis have been confirmed in people who had raw milk in the week they got sick. Officials said the illness has been reported in Cache, Davis, Morgan, Salt Lake, Utah and Weber counties. Two cases have also been confirmed in California and Idaho. The 1st case of the infection was reported on 9 May 2014.

The Utah Dept. of Health said all 45 cases are linked to raw milk or cream purchased at Ropelato Dairy in Weber County. The Utah Dept. of Agriculture suspended the dairy's license to sell raw milk on 4 Aug 2014 after several tests were positive for _Campylobacter_.

Larry Lewis with the UDAF said the dairy has been very cooperative in working with the inspectors, and it will be allowed to sell raw milk again as soon as it consistently passes safety tests. Officials said raw milk contaminated with disease-causing bacteria does not look, taste or smell any different. Basically, there is no easy way for the consumer to tell whether it is safe or not.

[In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al: Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis 2012; 18(3): 385-91 http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article.htm), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 percent) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products; 65 (54 percent) involved cheese; 42 percent were made from unpasteurized milk, and 56 involved fluid milk; 82 percent involved unpasteurized milk. In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ was responsible for 54 percent of the outbreaks, following by _Salmonella_ spp (22 percent), Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 percent), _Brucella_ spp (4 percent), _Listeria_ (4 percent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 percent).

Clearly, pasteurized milk can also transmit disease, and 48 outbreaks were reported. The source of contamination was reported in only 7 (14 percent), of which at least 4 resulted from post-pasteurization contamination by an infected food handler.

The reader is directed to the article for additional information and discussion. The ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products is potentially hazardous: "Caveat emptor:" Latin for "Let the buyer beware." - Mod.LL
