SOCIAL CIRCLE, Georgia. -- The cause of death of a bald eagle and a Canada
goose found at Clark's Hill Lake has been confirmed to be Avian Vacuolar
Myelinopathy or AVM, according to the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife
Disease Study at the University of Georgia, the Georgia Department of
Natural Resources (DNR), Wildlife Resources Division (WRD), and the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers (COE). A total of 10 additional bald eagles and
many coots are suspected to have died from AVM in recent weeks on this lake
as well. Laboratory analyses currently are underway to confirm the cause of
death in these birds.
"Because our bald eagle population is still recovering, the loss of 11
individuals in one area is significant," said Jim Ozier, a Senior Wildlife
Biologist with the Nongame Wildlife-Natural Heritage Section of WRD. "There
were 4 active bald eagle nests at Clark's Hill Lake last year. Two nests
were in Georgia and 2 nests were in South Carolina. This mortality could
have a significant impact on the bald eagle population in that area."
AVM affects the bird's central nervous system and was first diagnosed in
eagles found dead in Arkansas in 1994. AVM was first recognized in Georgia
in early 1999 when single affected eagles were found at Lake Juliette and
Clark's Hill. The cause of AVM is unknown, despite extensive diagnostic and
research efforts; however, a natural or man-made toxin is suspected. It is
believed eagles are exposed to AVM by ingesting affected coots, but
independent exposure of the 2 species cannot be ruled out.
"Because coots are potentially part of the spread of this disease duck
hunters need to be aware there is a possibility of infected birds in the
Clark's Hill area," added Todd Holbrook, Chief of the Game Management
Section of WRD. "While there is no evidence AVM will spread to humans, we
encourage hunters to watch the behavior of the birds. If it is unusual or
erratic, we ask them to please report this to our offices."
Officials from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) believe AVM is not
communicable to humans. However, DNR and COE officials recommend hunters
watch birds for strange flight patterns and not consume them if strange
behavior is noted.
Symptoms of birds affected with AVM include erratic flight or inability to
fly; swimming tipped to one side with one or both legs or wings extended;
or being in the water on their back with their feet in the air. On land,
birds stagger and have difficulty walking and may fall over unable to right
themselves (appear intoxicated). Birds are usually alert and may bite when
handled even if unable to escape capture.
COE officials will continue to monitor the AVM outbreak on Clark's Hill
Lake. If you notice any strange behavior of eagles, coots, Canada Geese, or
any other waterfowl, please contact the COE office at (800) 944-7207, ext.
3426.
