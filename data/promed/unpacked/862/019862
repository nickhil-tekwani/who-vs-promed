Although the world is focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, there are many other dangerous pathogens still out there, like _Yersinia pestis_, which causes plague, the deadly disease that killed tens of millions of people during the infamous Black Death in the 14th century. Although plague has been largely eradicated in the developed world, it still affects hundreds of people globally each year.

When a human is infected with bubonic plague from a flea bite and it goes untreated, the infection can progress and spread to the lungs, resulting in pneumonic plague. The most feared clinical form of plague, pneumonic plague is typically lethal if not quickly treated, and infected patients can transmit the disease to others via respiratory droplets. A team of scientists from Northern Arizona University's Pathogen and Microbiome Institute (PMI), led by professor Dave Wagner, recently published their findings from a remarkable study involving antimicrobial resistant (AMR) plague.

Although pneumonic plague outbreaks are now extremely rare, scientists consider plague to be a reemerging and neglected disease, particularly in the East African island country of Madagascar, which reports the majority of annual global cases. With no vaccine against it, preventing mortality from plague requires rapid diagnosis followed by treatment with antibiotics. An AMR strain of _Y. pestis_ -- resistant to the antimicrobial streptomycin, usually the first-line treatment for plague in Madagascar -- was isolated from a pneumonic plague outbreak that occurred there in 2013, involving 22 cases, including 3 fatalities.

Wagner's team, including PMI senior research scientists Dawn Birdsell and Nawarat Somprasong, PMI assistant director Amy Vogler, professor Herbert Schweizer, associate professor Jason Sahl and senior research coordinator Carina Hall, conducted a study of this outbreak, together with long-term research partners at the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar and scientists at the Institut Pasteur Paris and the Madagascar Ministry of Public Health. The results of the study, "Transmission of antimicrobial resistant _Yersinia pestis_ during a pneumonic plague outbreak," were recently published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.

"By characterizing the outbreak using epidemiology, clinical diagnostics and DNA-fingerprinting approaches," Wagner said, "we determined -- for the 1st time -- that AMR strains of _Y. pestis_ can be transmitted person to person. The AMR strain from this outbreak is resistant to streptomycin due to a spontaneous point mutation but is still susceptible to many other antimicrobials including co-trimoxazole [trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole - Mod.LL]. Luckily, the 19 cases that were treated all received co-trimoxazole in addition to streptomycin, and all of them survived."

"The point mutation, which also is the source of streptomycin resistance in other bacterial species, has occurred independently in _Y. pestis_ at least 3 times and appears to have no negative effect on the AMR strain, suggesting that it could potentially persist in nature via the natural rodent-flea transmission cycle. However, AMR _Y. pestis_ strains are exceedingly rare, and the mutation has not been observed again in Madagascar since this outbreak," he said.

[This observation recently published (1) was from an outbreak of pneumonic plague in Madagascar in 2013 with person-to-person spread. The large outbreak in the island nation that occurred in 2017 did not apparently reflect streptomycin resistance, which suggested that the resistant isolate was not as "fit" as the sensitive strains in nature.

Madagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (2). The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This was an ominous observation, but the strain also did not seem to persist.
