People who have been infected with the H5N1 avian influenza virus
might be especially susceptible to avian viruses because they are
genetically predisposed to them, leading disease experts suggested on
Thu 4 May 2006. Of the 205 [now 206 - Mod.CP] reported cases of human
infections since late 2003, there have been many family clusters
involving blood relatives, such as father and children, mothers and
daughters. Of the total infections, 113 people died in 9 countries.
"There have been family clusters. So there has to be certainly a
genetic aspect to it," Robert Webster of the St Jude Children's
Research Hospital told a bird flu conference organized by the Lancet
medical journal in Singapore.
Another leading expert, Hiroshi Kida, who has spent more than 3
decades working on viruses, has long harbored the same theory. "There
has not been a single case of infection involving husband and wife
[i.e. family members not related by blood] ," Kida said told the
Reuters News Agency in an interview. Kida is with the Department of
Diseases Control at Hokkaido University in Japan. Kida explained that
people infected with H5N1 have a carbohydrate receptor on cells
lining their throats. The receptor -- called alpha 2,3 -- is
predominantly found in birds and avian influenza viruses like to bind
to this class of receptors to replicate and cause disease.
Human influenza viruses, however, prefer to bind to another receptor
called alpha 2,6, which is dominant in humans. "I think people who
are infected with avian strains are special. They must have alpha 2,3
receptors," Kida said. Although humans have some amount of alpha 2,3,
Kida said alpha 2,6 was by far more "dominant" in most people. [For a
more precise discussion, see ProMED-mail post archived as "Avian
influenza virus (03): virus receptor distribution 20060322.0893". - Mod.CP]
Kida is now trying to look for H5N1 survivors in Viet Nam and
Thailand to verify his theory, and if it proves to be true, it could
mean that most people simply cannot catch H5N1 easily -- unless the
virus mutates. "If it changes receptor specificity, then it must be
dangerous," Kida said.
Many experts see H5N1 [virus] as possibly triggering an influenza
pandemic that is long overdue. But that could happen only if it
mutates sufficiently to become easily passed among people. Most of
its victims contracted the virus directly from sick birds. And there
have not been any proven cases of human-to-human transmission.
Although very little is known about the virus, much work has been
done to find out how it is transmitted, why so few people have been
infected, and why it hasn't yet become infectious among people. A
group of researchers recently postulated that the virus lodges itself
deep in the lungs, and not in the upper respiratory tract where it
could more easily dislodge itself, get out of the body and spread.
But while Kida does not dismiss this theory, he thinks it is not the only one.

[It could be reasonably inferred from this type of analysis that
evolution of the H5N1 avian pathogen into a form capable of
sustaining a human pandemic may require progressive changes affecting
several virus properties rather than simply one change in a single
phenotypic property of the virus. - Mod.CP]
