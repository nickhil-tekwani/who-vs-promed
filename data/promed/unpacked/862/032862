La Libertad: 13 people infected with anthrax
--------------------------------------------
The regional councillor of the Andean province of Otuzco [La Libertad region], Rafael Mayer Haro, reported 13 cases of cutaneous anthrax in the region, who are being treated in the clinic/health post in the locality of Sinsicap.

The cases presented since the weekend [of 3-4 March 2012], but just yesterday [6 Mar 2012] the presence of the cutaneous infection was confirmed and is currently being treated by local health specialists.

Mayer Haro reported that no known vaccination campaigns of the cattle in Sinsicap have taken place so this is probably one of the causes of the infection.

[Otuzco is in the Region of La Libertad, so following custom that is why the place designation differs from my ProMED-ESP colleague.

Anthrax in Peru is essentially a coastal and low altitude disease. It is enzootic in 5/10 of the coastal departments and normally where vaccination occurs is in the coastal farms. Sinsicap is embedded in the Andes west of Trujillo; for a map check out http://www.fallingrain.com/world/PE/13/Sinsicap.html; or even better, find it on Google Earth. Sinsicap is some 49 kilometers (30 mi) west from Trujillo on the coast.

La Libertad is listed by OIE as having bovine outbreaks in 2000, 2002, and 2004. Anthrax is infrequently reported in Peruvian sheep and goats, and not at all in llamas and alpacas. With some 7 years since the last reported outbreak in the department, it could be that vaccination has lapsed in the department.

At this time there is no information as to how these 13 people acquired their cutaneous infections. If I were to guess it would be from handling beef at a bargain price in a street market; in a small Andean town like Sinsicap the usual available meat would be either from sheep, goats, or chickens and chickens don't suffer from anthrax. And with 13 cases I would guess at some 5 to 6 or more families being affected, including the stall owner. Interviewing the affected individuals for any common experiences would quickly reveal the source. - Mod.MHJ
