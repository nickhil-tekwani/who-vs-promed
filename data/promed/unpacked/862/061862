A person returning from a trip abroad has set off a measles outbreak in Uppsala, with cases now turning up in Stockholm, health officials warned on Wednesday [27 Feb 2013].

The Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control (Smittskyddsinstitutet, SMI) has warned the public that 10 measles cases in Uppsala and Stockholm are believed to be linked to the same source of contagion, a patient returning from abroad. "The link is likely, but we haven't confirmed it through laboratory tests yet," Katarina Widgren at SMI told The Local.

The most recent case was reported just days ago, and as measles is a highly contagious airborne disease which can, in the worst case, lead to pneumonia or meningitis, Swedes are required by law to report falling ill to their doctor. "If you fear you might have the symptoms of measles, please make sure you don't go sit in a waiting room at the hospital or at your general practice," Widgren said. "Call Vardguiden or get in touch with your doctor immediately so you don't accidentally infect the entire waiting room."

The number of confirmed measles cases in the region has now reached a total of 115, with another 108 suspected cases. The latest figures for the on-going measles outbreak in the North East have been published by the Health Protection Agency (HPA).

The numbers of cases started increasing at the beginning of September 2012. There has been an increase of 11 confirmed and 15 suspected cases since last week. Initially, cases were being reported in the County Durham and Darlington areas, but from early January [2013], the majority of cases have been reported on Teesside.

Measles can affect people at any age, but 39 per cent of the cases in this outbreak are aged between 10 and 19 years, the majority of whom are unvaccinated school children and young adults. However, the authorities are now starting to see an increase in cases in children aged under one, who are too young to be offered routine MMR vaccination. Julia Waller, HPA spokeswoman, said: "Measles is highly infectious, and unvaccinated children and adults who haven't had it before are at risk when it is circulating, as it is now in this region.

To prevent spreading the illness, the HPA is advising people with measles to stay away from school or work until at least 4 full days have elapsed after a rash appears. You should also avoid contact with pregnant women, people with weak immune systems and babies.

[The observation that: "...the authorities are now starting to see an increase in cases in children aged under one, who are too young to be offered routine MMR vaccination..." is disquieting and suggestive that the vaccination programme in this region is far from achieving its aim.

An outbreak of 189 cases of measles has been reported in Swansea, Neath and Port Talbot, Public Health Wales reports. It began in November 2012, but 20 cases have been notified in the last week, and the total is more than for the whole of Wales in the last 3 years. So far, 32 secondary schools, primary schools, and nurseries are affected. Parents are being urged to make sure their children receive the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination.

The outbreak only affects the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board area and eclipses the number of cases across the whole of Wales since 2010. Last year's [2012] figure of confirmed cases for Wales stood at 116, while there were just 19 in 2011 and 8 the year before, according to Public Health Wales. There were 159 cases in 2009, still lower than the current outbreak in southwest Wales.

Dr Marion Lyons, director of health protection for Public Health Wales (PHW), said: "We continue to be concerned at the number of cases of measles we are seeing in the Swansea and Neath Port Talbot areas. "We cannot emphasise enough that measles is an illness that can kill or leave patients with permanent complications including severe brain damage, and the only protection is 2 doses of the MMR vaccination."

She added that people most at risk of catching measles are children of school age who have not had 2 doses of MMR. Children should receive the 1st dose of the vaccine at 12 to 13 months of age and the 2nd at 3 years and 4 months of age.

PHW estimates that there are more than 8500 school children at risk of measles in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg area.

Already, 111 measles cases have been investigated since the beginning of the year [2013], according to the Minister of Public Health. The Minister of Health (MOH) Andre Mama Fouda is categorical: "The prevalence of measles remains a high priority in Cameroon, with 1184 suspected cases, including 609 positive and 73 deaths. In 2013, we observed an outbreak of measles with 111 cases and 26 positive cases investigated." And that's not all, because Cameroon has 1184 yellow fever patients, of whom 111 have been confirmed.

These figures were revealed this Mon 25 Feb 2013 on the occasion of the annual meeting of the managers of national immunization programs (PEV) for Central Africa. The 4-day meeting, held in Douala, brings together members from all countries of the sub-region and the World Health Organization (WHO). It is a question for these countries to find strategies to eradicate these diseases preventable by vaccination. This meeting will, therefore, allow managers to consult PEV for effective harmonization in the fight against [vaccine-preventable] diseases.

Charlotte Faty Ndiaye, Oms representative of Cameroon, says that much remains to be done: "The vaccine-preventable diseases such as pneumonia, measles, diarrhea, and meningitis continue to be a major cause of mortality and morbidity. The average coverage of the 1st dose of measles in Africa is more than 10 times lower than the level observed in the Americas and the Western Pacific. 64 percent of the 19.3 million children not vaccinated annually with DTP3 live in low-income countries."

An outbreak of measles has been affecting the northern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) since 2010, where children suffering from malnutrition were also the most affected by lack of vaccines.

The Deputy Chief of Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) Amaury Gregoire said today [28 Feb 2013] that this epidemic "continues to affect the country since 2010 and is particularly deadly in children under 5 years of age. Mortality can reach 25 percent of the cases due to malnutrition or other additional conditions," he said. "It is unacceptable that someone still can die of measles in the 21st century," said the doctor in an MSF statement. During one year, the nongovernmental organisation had vaccinated 440 000 children. "But in the DRC, there are hundreds of thousands of children who were never immunised and continue to suffer as a result of a disease that is easily preventable," he added.

The vaccine is readily usable and cheap, but the lack of sanitation, infrastructure, roads and other factors make it very difficult to implement immunization campaigns, MSF said. According to the source, in one area, MSF has tried to vaccinate 76 000 children with only 2 refrigerators and a mobile computer.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated in Geneva last January [2013] that 800 000 children in the DRC had not been immunized against the disease, which has 68 million inhabitants.

The Jigawa government said on Wednesday [27 Feb 2013] that it had concluded plans to conduct a comprehensive measles vaccination programme to contain the spread of the disease in the state. The Commissioner for Health, Dr. Tafida Abubakar, said this in an interview in Dutse [the State Capital]. Abubakar said that the exercise was necessary in view of the reported measles outbreak in neighbouring states as well as sporadic cases of the disease recorded in some parts of the state.

He said that the ministry had deployed health personnel and vaccines to health facilities across the state to facilitate smooth conduct of the exercise. "There are cases of measles and cerebro-spinal meningitis (CSM) we have been getting sporadically in the state. We took extra caution based on the fact that the states of Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, and Zamfara are experiencing outbreaks of measles, and measles is a highly contagious disease. We also know that, to be on the safe side, we must have vaccination coverage beyond 80 and 85 per cent [95 percent according to WHO] in the population to ensure that children do not contract measles."

The excessive heat being experienced in Niger state by residents has led to an outbreak of measles in no fewer than 6 communities in Chachanga Local Government Area of the state, with about 10 children hospitalised so far.

The Nigerian Tribune gathered that the outbreak of the disease was spreading fast across other communities, which included Nassarawa C, Ungwan Daji, Tayi, Albishir, Dutse Kura Gwari, and Kutirku in Chanchanga Local Government Area, but there have been no deaths recorded so far. Affected children are receiving treatment at the General Hospital, Minna.

Confirming the outbreak of the killer disease, the council chairman, Alhaji Yakubu Mohammed Sallau, has said that medical personnel were currently going around to local government areas to determine the magnitude of the outbreak, adding that an emergency response of large scale vaccination had been put in place to prevent the disease from causing further damage.

According to him, "A combined team of medical personnel from the state Ministry of Health and Chanchanga Local Government Area has visited the affected areas to verify the outbreak and determine its prevalence magnitude.

"During the measles vaccination campaign, children aged 0-1 year will be immunised. Parents are, therefore, advised to visit any clinic near them and the General Hospital Minna to get their children vaccinated," he said.

[It is surprising that "...excessive heat being experienced in Niger state by residents has led to an outbreak of measles in no fewer than 6 communities..." It may be that humidity accompanying the excessive heat is the reason for the enhanced transmission of measles virus infection.

Niger state is a state in northwestern Nigeria and the largest state in the country. The state capital is Minna, and other major cities are Bida, Kontagora, and Suleja. It was formed in 1976 when the then North-Western State was bifurcated into Niger State and Sokoto State.

According to Anhui province's disease surveillance information reporting system, as of 17 Feb 2013, the province reported a total of 225 confirmed cases of measles compared to the same period last year [2012] (with 13 cases). The Provincial Health Department issued a notice requiring medical institutions at all levels to strictly implement the measles triage system, to establish outpatient [clinics], and to ensure that 8-month-old to 15-year-old children receive measles vaccine to achieve an immunization rate of 95 percent or more [and ultimately, a vaccination rate of 90 percent or more].

According to statistics, the cities of Fuyang, Bengbu, Huainan, Bozhou, and Hefei are the 5 cities with the largest numbers of new measles cases and accounted for 89.8 percent of the total incidence, which was composed of children aged 8-11 months. 7.6 percent were in other groups, and persons more than 15 years of age accounted for 9.3 percent.

The Provincial Health Department said that medical institutions at all levels should strictly implement the measles preflight triage system with particular emphasis on vigilance for rashes and fever and to avoid misdiagnosis of measles cases. Medical institutions should also ensure that measles cases are treated in isolation with strict implementation of disinfection systems as well as strengthen the protection of health care workers against measles nosocomial infection.

[9] Japan (2012 review)
Date: 21-23 Feb 2013
Source: Infectious Agents Surveillance Report (IASR) by The National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) -- The Topic of This Month Vol. 34, No. 2 (No. 396)
http://www.nih.go.jp/niid/en/index-e/865-iasr/3234-tpc396.html


The WHO Western Pacific Region, to which Japan belongs, targeted measles elimination by 2012 (see p. 24 of this issue). The current verification criterion of measles elimination for the region is "the absence of endemic measles transmission* of endemic virus for more than 3 years in the presence of a well performing surveillance system, which is supported by genotype analysis of the isolates." [*Endemic measles transmission is defined as "the existence of continuous transmission of indigenous or imported measles virus that persists for over 12 months in any defined geographic area." (WHO, WER, 85: 490-495, 2010)].

Measles incidence under the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases: Infectious Diseases Control Law requests notification of all measles cases since January 2008 (IASR 29: 179-181, 2008 & 29: 189-190, 2008). From week 1 to week 52 of 2012, a total of 293 cases were reported, among which 216 cases including 75 "modified" measles were supported by laboratory diagnosis, but 77 cases were supported by clinical diagnosis (as of 8 Jan 2013). In 2012, measles cases were reduced to 2/3rds of those in 2011 (from 434 cases or 3.58 per million population in 2011 to 293 cases or 2.32 per million population in 2012) (Fig. 1).

In 2012, the largest number of measles cases were reported from Tokyo (84 cases) followed by Aichi (39 cases), Saitama (32 cases), Kanagawa (29 cases) and Chiba (23 cases). The total cases in 4 prefectures within the metropolitan area, Tokyo, Saitama, Kanagawa and Chiba, occupied 57 percent of all the reported cases. 21 prefectures reported 0 cases (Fig. 2), among which 12 prefectures reported 0 cases in 2 successive years (see p. 37 of this issue). In 2012, 32 prefectures, in contrast to 19 prefectures in 2011, reported less than one in one million population, the target as a measure of near measles elimination (WHO, WER 85: 490-495, 2010).

The sex ratio was 158 males vs. 135 females. As for age distribution (Fig. 3, Ref.), one year olds were the highest in number (29 cases) followed by 0 year olds (16 cases). The teens that occupied 43 percent of the total in 2008 occupied only 13 percent in 2012. In contrast, 20s and 30s increased in proportion, and, as a consequence, adults occupied 58 percent of the total measles cases in 2012.

Among the measles patients, 84 had received no dose, 78 only one dose, and 17 2 doses. The vaccination history of the remaining 114 was unknown. None of the 16 0-year-old cases had received vaccination. Among 29 one-year-old cases, 15 had received no dose and 13 only one dose. Among the 132 cases in their 20s and 30s, 22 had received no dose, 35 only one dose and 3 2 doses.

Two schools, a primary school and a secondary school, temporarily closed in September 2012 in Miyazaki Prefecture on account of measles outbreaks (see p. 33 of this issue).

Isolation and detection of measles virus: The measles virus genotype D5 that had been endemic in Japan during 2006-2008 has not been detected later than May 2010. Since 2009, measles viruses whose genotypes are those of foreign-origin were detected (Table 1 and Table 2). In 2012, 45 D8 strains were isolated, among which 24 were derived from an outbreak in Aichi (IASR 33: 66, 2012), and 8 were from an outbreak in Miyazaki (see p. 33 of this issue). Other isolates were 10 D9 strains, among which 5 were from an outbreak in Okayama (IASR 33: 166-167, 2012); 7 H1 strains, among which 5 were from an outbreak in Fukushima (IASR 33: 242-244, 2012); and 6 D4 strains, which were all from sporadic cases.

The National Epidemiological Surveillance of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (see p. 25 of this issue): WHO considers that measles elimination requires 95 percent population immunity against measles virus in each birth cohort. In Japan, gelatin particle agglutination (PA) assay is conducted, and the titers above 1:16 are considered positive. In 2012, the antibody-positive rate became 95 percent or more in all the age groups 2 years or older for the 1st time, which proved the effectiveness of the 2 routine doses (Fig. 4). However, as the antibody-positive rate in the one-year age group was 67 percent, the earliest possible vaccination after attaining 12 months of age is desired.

It has been considered that protection of individuals from symptomatic measles infection requires a titer 1:128 or higher. However, the antibody titer of more than 15 percent of age groups 0, 1, 4 and 5 years was less than 1:128.

Vaccination rate (see p. 28 of this issue): Since FY2006, routine immunization in Japan has adopted measles-rubella combined vaccine, which is administered in 2 doses, the 1st dose to children of one year (1st vaccination) and the 2nd dose to children preceding one year before the school entry (2nd vaccination)(IASR 27: 85-86, 2006). In addition, from 2008 to 2012, supplementary vaccination was conducted to children whose age corresponds to the age of the 1st year class of the secondary school (3rd vaccination) and to those whose age corresponds to the age of the 3rd year class of the high school (4th vaccination) to ensure 2 doses in these age groups as well (IASR 29: 189-190, 2008).

The vaccination rate of measles-containing vaccines (M, MR) in FY2011 was 95 percent for the 1st (96 percent in 2010), 93 percent for the 2nd (92 percent in 2010), 88 percent for the 3rd (87 percent in 2010), and 81 percent for the 4th (79 percent in 2010). The coverage of the 1st vaccination exceeded 95 percent (targeted coverage rate) successively in 2011 and in 2012.

For further increase of vaccination coverage: Consequent to the introduction of the 3rd and 4th vaccinations, there was a great reduction of measles cases under 20 years of age (Fig. 3, Ref.). To achieve measles elimination, local governments are requested to make further efforts to attain 95 percent or more vaccine coverage, not only for the 1st but also for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th vaccinations. According to the questionnaire-based survey destined to municipalities, towns and villages, which was conducted by a research group supported by Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare (MHLW), factors that played an important role in attaining a coverage of 95 percent or higher were (1) timely reporting on the vaccine coverage at the community level, (2) identification of unimmunized children so as to recommend each unvaccinated child to go to vaccination by mail, and (3) preparatory health checks conducted in October and November in the previous year of school entry, where immunization is recommended to children with insufficient vaccine doses (see p. 31 of this issue).

Unvaccinated persons belonging to target cohorts of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th vaccinations in FY2012 are advised to be vaccinated before 31 Mar 2013, as public expense will not cover the vaccination after this date. During "the Children's Immunization Week," from Fri 1 Mar to Thu 7 Mar 2013, some local medical associations will open clinics on Saturday, Sunday, and evenings for vaccination. The eligible persons are advised to be vaccinated at the earliest occasion before the end of March this year [2013].

Importance of laboratory diagnosis: In 2012, 1/4th of the notified cases were diagnosed by symptoms without laboratory confirmation. More than half of the laboratory diagnosis was based on IgM tests. Measles cases weakly positive for IgM or clinically suspected measles are often cases infected by rubella virus, B19 virus, HHV-6, HHV-7, enteroviruses, etc., which occasionally develop skin rash (see p. 34 of this issue). Therefore, direct detection of measles virus genome, such as by PCR or virus isolation, is important. Prefectural and municipal public health institutes (PHIs) and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) have established the collaboration network for laboratory diagnosis based on PCR testing. In 2011-2012, 40 percent of the laboratory-diagnosed specimens were PCR-tested by PHIs (see p. 36 of this issue). Physicians are requested to obtain clinical specimens under appropriate timing, and the person in charge of transportation should keep the samples under the appropriate temperature. The PHIs should observe the required temperature control of the received specimens during the storage and testing (IASR 33: 309-310, 2012).

Measures to be taken from now: In 2012, the "foreign strains" were isolated not only from the imported cases but also from sporadic cases without history of overseas travel (Table 2, see p. 36 of this issue and http://www.nih.go.jp/niid/en/iasr-measles-e.html). For measles elimination, maintenance of high vaccine coverage and a system that allows tracing of an outbreak back to the infection source and immediate interruption of virus transmission are important. The principle of "immediate response to any one measles-suspected case" should be applied to all the cases. The response includes active epidemiological investigation supported by laboratory and prompt measures against virus spread, which require coordination between medical facilities, health centers, PHIs, and NIID. So as to prevent importation, people including adults are advised to complete measles vaccination before going abroad. It is also important to conduct a vaccination campaign for those going abroad.

The Japanese government recently revised the "Special Infectious Disease Prevention Guidelines on Measles (MHLW, 28 Dec 2007)". According to the revised guidelines adopted in April 2013, Japan targets elimination of measles by FY2015 to obtain WHO's certificate of measles elimination and projects maintenance of the measles elimination status thereafter. According to the guidelines, a measles elimination verification committee will be established (see p. 39 of this issue). Cases notified by a physician will be examined for clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, vaccine histories, and possibility of contact with measles patients. If the possibility of measles is excluded as a consequence, the doctor in charge will request retraction of the notification. In order to prove measles elimination status, it is imperative to obtain clinical specimens in a timely manner and to examine the possibility of endemic circulation through genotyping.

A 39-year-old Seminole county woman is the latest Central Florida resident this year [2013] to have a confirmed case of measles, county health officials announced today [28 Feb 2013].

In January 2013, 4 children from one Orange county home also were reported to have the disease. The woman, who is at home recovering, is not connected with the children and could not have contracted the disease from them, said Dain Weister, a Seminole County Health Department spokesman.

Measles is very rare, health officials said. Last year [2012], only one case was reported in Florida and none in Central Florida. In 2011, the state had 7 cases, 3 of which were in Central Florida.

Measles is spread through the air. Symptoms include a blotchy rash, fever, cough, runny nose, watery nose, aches, and tiny white spots with bluish-white centers inside the mouth. People who have received the measles vaccine or have had measles in the past will be protected against the disease, health officials said.
