Dan Gandacu et al. Resurgence of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Israel, 2001-2012. Emer Infect Dis 2014;20:1605-11.
----------------------------------------
Cutaneous leishmaniasis has long been endemic in Israel. After a 15-year period of moderate illness rates, reported incidence increased from 0.4 cases per 100 000 population in 2001 to 4.4 cases per 100 000 population in 2012, and the disease emerged in areas where its presence had previously been minimal.

Analysis of the isolated Leishmania showed an expansion of Leishmania major infections over large areas in the southern part of the country and the occurrence of spatially focused _L. tropica_ outbreaks in the northern part of the country.

The reservoir of _L. major_ parasites consists of rodents (e.g., _Psamomys obeesus_, _Meriones crassus_, _Microtus guentheri_, _Meriones tristrami_, Gerbillus spp.), whereas the main reservoir of _L. tropica_ parasites is the rock hyrax (_Procavia capensis_).

The increasing incidence of _L. tropica_ infections has also been observed in other countries in the Mediterranean Basin and elsewhere in Asia (1,2,3). In addition to the resulting increase in CL incidence, the presence of _L. tropica_ parasites poses other concerns. Infections caused by this species tend to be more diffuse and difficult to treat than infections caused by _L. major_ parasites and can sometimes lead to more chronic or more dangerous forms of the disease, such as leishmaniasis recidivans or, in rare cases, visceral leishmaniasis.

The most probable causes for increased incidence in more recent years are the changes to the vector-reservoir-human population network resulting from land development and construction, the expansion of populated areas, and changes in land use (such as in Tiberias, Ma'ale Adumim, and Ofakim). These factors have altered the relationships of human communities with the surrounding natural environment and have created favorable conditions for mammalian reservoirs and sand fly populations to breed in close proximity to human habitations.

-----------------------------------------
Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is an endemic zoonosis in southern Israel. In recent years, substantial urbanization has been taking place in this region. The introduction of populations into endemic foci was previously reported to facilitate human CL outbreaks. Our aim was to describe a continuous CL outbreak in southern Israel, through laboratory reports of CL diagnosis. Methods: The Soroka University Medical Center parasitology laboratory is the major laboratory confirming CL cases in our region. Data regarding patients referred to the hospital for CL diagnosis were collected retrospectively. Cases were defined by microscopic findings of skin lesion biopsies.

Results:
The annual number of cases sent for CL laboratory confirmation increased from a mean of 77 +/- 9 in the years 2007-2010 to 178, 327, and 528 in the years 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively. The respective increase in annual confirmed/positive cases of CL was from 36 +/- 12 to 117, 171, and 282, leading to respective increase in CL rate (per 100 000) from 5.8 +/- 1.9 to 18.4, 26.3, and 42.7. The outbreak was mainly (greater than 60 percent) observed in the north-west area of the region.
Conclusions: In conclusion, a 7-fold increase in laboratory-confi rmed CL was observed in southern Israel in 2007 - 2013, probably reflecting a bigger outbreak, possibly related to urban expansion bordering with CL foci.

[ProMED thanks Professor Gad Baneth for alerting us to these 2 studies clearly demonstrating an increase in cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Israel over the past decade. Excerpts from the 2 studies are shown above, which document the increase in the number of cases and propose that increasing urbanization close to foci of the reservoir explain the increasing numbers. - Mod.EP
