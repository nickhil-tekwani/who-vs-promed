Chikungunya, the viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes, has spread
to 72 taluks in the state, causing concern among officials and doctors
of the Health Department. [A taluk is an administrative division in
some Indian states and consists of a headquarters city with authority
over villages and municipalities within its jurisdiction. - Mod.TY]

Over 4190 suspected cases of chikungunya have been reported from 111
primary health centres of 72 taluks in 23 districts. Suspected cases
of chikungunya have been reported from all districts except Bidar,
Raichur, Koppal, Hassan, Dakshina Kannada and Udupi as of 1 Jun [2009].

The highest number of suspected cases of chikungunya is from Uttara
Kananda district (969) followed by Haveri (710) and Bangalore city
(308). No death due to the disease has been reported so far, sources
in the Department of Health and Family Welfare told The Hindu on
Tuesday [2 Jun 2009].

Scientists from the National Institute of Virology (NIV) Field
Station, Bangalore have visited some of the affected areas and tested
the blood samples of the victims. They collected samples of 1189
people. As many as 449 cases tested positive in the state, and 129 of
them are in Bangalore city alone, officials said.

The officials have appealed to the public to use clean containers and
drums for storing water and thus prevent the breeding of mosquitoes in
the stored water. In all districts, the department claimed to have
taken steps to control it. Both indoor and outdoor fogging had been
undertaken in 202 affected villages as part of preventive measures.
Sources said an irregular supply of drinking water in the slums of
Bangalore city and storage of water by residents in drums for weeks
are major reasons for breeding of mosquitoes and the spread of the
disease.

[2] Belgium ex Thailand
Date: Thu 4 Jun 2009
From: Emmanuel Bottieau <EBottieau@itg.be>


A 43-year-old Belgian woman, with no medical history, consulted on 15
Apr 2009 at the travel clinic of the Institute of Tropical Medicine,
Antwerp, Belgium for high-grade fever, headache, generalized muscle
aches and skin rash for 4 days. She had traveled to Thailand for
holidays and had remained exclusively in Phuket from 2-13 Apr 2009.
She had consulted in a hospital in Phuket on 12 Apr 2009, where a
dengue NS1 antigenic test was performed and reported as negative.

In our centre, she presented with a macular skin rash on the trunk and
limbs and a slightly swollen right ankle. Laboratory tests showed a
leucopenia (2290 WBC/uL), a borderline thrombocytopenia (138 000
platelets/uL) and slightly elevated liver transaminases. A working
diagnosis of dengue was made. Fever abated the day after consultation,
but the patient developed in the following 2-3 weeks severe joint
aches. Paired serology against dengue remained negative. Serology
(IFAT) revealed a more than 4-fold increase of IgG titers for
chikungunya virus (from 1/16 on 15 Apr 2009 to 1/256 on 29 Apr 2009).
A PCR testing of the acute-phase serum was positive for chikungunya
virus.

[ProMED thanks Drs. Bottieau and Van Esbroeck for providing this report.

Unless the situation has changed in 2009, it is unlikely that the
mosquito _Aedes albopictus_, an effective vector of chikungunya virus,
is present in Belgium.

An excellent technical report on _Ae. albopictus_ in Europe stated
that in Belgium, "only a few specimens of _Aedes albopictus_ were
observed in one focus in 2000. In 2003 and 2007, no specimens were
found. Since no control programmes were in effect, it is assumed that
the species was unable to become established due to unfavorable
climatic conditions and/or a founder population that was too small.
Therefore, a viable wild population could not become established."

Although ProMED does not normally report on imported cases of
pathogens into countries where ongoing transmission does not occur,
this report is of interest for 2 reasons. It indicates that
chikungunya virus transmission is occurring in a popular tourist
destination in southern Thailand and again illustrates that rapid,
long-distance movement of the virus occurs, with introduction into
areas previously free of this pathogen. Should the distribution of
_Ae. albopictus_ change, as the maps in the technical report indicate
they might, chikungunya and other viruses could expand their
geographic ranges.
