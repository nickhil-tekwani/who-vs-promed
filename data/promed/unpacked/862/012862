Hundreds of sheep die after eating toxic plants
-----------------------------------------------
SODA SPRINGS, Idaho: More than 300 sheep grazing near a former phosphate
mine died last month after eating plants contaminated with selenium, a
waste product from mining. The sheep were part of a 2 year study sponsored
by the University of Idaho and the JR Simplot Company to determine how
animals react to selenium in the environment. They were grazing by the
now-defunct Conda phosphate mine, which is owned by Simplot.
Scientists blamed a plant called curlycap gumweed (_Grindelia_), which
absorbs high levels of selenium from the soil. Selenium is a naturally
occurring element that is toxic in high levels. Greg Moller, University of
Idaho associate professor of environmental toxicology, said researchers did
not anticipate the deaths.
Last summer, the research team gave 72 sheep varying levels of selenium in
vegetation and water, and only one elderly sheep died, Moller said. They
[have] allowed the 1400 animal band to graze in the mining area [since] 19
May this year. By 25 May, the sheep began to die.
Preliminary tests show the curlycap gumweed plants had selenium levels
about 40 times the recommended maximum. Simplot spokesman Rick Phillips
said researchers did not include the plant in their earlier tests.
The Conda mine was opened in 1906. Simplot bought the mine in the 1960s and
closed it in the 1970s. Because mining guidelines were less stringent in
the past, Phillips said, the contaminated soil is probably near the
surface. Phillips said the research was a breakthrough. "It's shocking to
see so many sheep die, but we're learning so much more than we did before,"
Phillips said. The sheep owners will be reimbursed. In 2001, more than 150
sheep died from selenium poisoning in the Conda mine area. In 1996, horses
in the region died from selenium poisoning.

[Selenium (Se) toxicity is a serious threat to livestock in the western
United States. Selenosis may affect all livestock, but especially cattle
and sheep. Several plant species, generally in the western US, are selenium
accumulators, such as _Astragalus_ (loco weeds and milk vetches),
_Onopisis_ (goldenweed) and _Zylorhiza_ (woody asters).
Acute poisoning is caused most often by the single consumption of a
sufficient quantity of a highly seleniferous plants, which produce severe
symptoms. Death usually occurs within a few hours. Cattle and sheep are the
most likely species to be affected, but horses, goats, and swine can also
be affected. Studies have shown the minimum lethal dose for cattle may be
as little as 3 mg/kg body weight, while for horses the dose may be 3.3
mg/kg of body weight, and for swine 1.2 mg/kg of body weight has caused
death in 5 days. Signs of acute intoxication are abnormal movement, dark
watery diarrhea, elevated temperature, weak and rapid pulse, labored
respiration, bloating and abdominal pain, mucous membranes are pale and
blue, and pupils are dilated. There is no known treatment to reverse the
effects of the poisoning, and often the animal dies before a diagnosis can
be made.
Chronic selenosis occurs when there is a prolonged consumption of a low
level of selenium. "Blind staggers" occurs when animals ingest
water-soluble selenium compounds naturally found in accumulator plants.
Toxicity from eating plants or grain with protein-bound, insoluble selenium
is called "alkali disease."
The signs of blind staggers occur in 3 stages:
--wandering, stumbling over objects, anorexia, visual impairment;
--increase in the severity of the first stage, front legs seem unable to
support the animal;
--blindness, paralysis of tongue and swallowing mechanism, rapid and
labored respiration, salivation, and low temperature.
The animal will die within a few hours of the onset of the third stage. The
action of the toxicity has been documented to have a delay between stages.
The first and second stages may go unnoticed. Weeks later, the animal may
show signs of the third stage and die. In sheep, it is more difficult to
diagnose because the stages are not as well defined as in cattle.
Toxic amounts of Se can also cause birth defects in offspring from dams fed
such levels. Alkali disease is more chronic than blind staggers, taking
longer to be manifest, even perhaps years in some cases. It is caused by
the animals feeding on plants and grain having protein-bound, insoluble
selenium. This disease can affect all livestock, but it is detected mostly
in cattle and horses. Generally signs are lack of vitality, anemia,
emaciation, stiffness of joints, lameness, rough coat, loss of long hair,
and hoof sloughing and deformities. Hoof deformities are a classic sign of
selenium and can cause lameness and severe pain for the animal; food and
water must be provided to the animal, for it may be hesitant to walk.
Removing the animals from the seleniferous areas is the most effective
means of preventing the disease. Treating the soil with sulfates (S), to
change the S:Se ratio, can sometimes depress Se uptake by accumulator
plants. Studies have shown feeding a higher protein diet may reduce the
toxicity of Se; animals fed the same amount of toxic selenium but fed a
higher protein diet lived for a few more days than those animals fed a low
protein diet. Dilution of high Se feeds with low Se feeds in a mixed ration
will help to prevent toxicity. Recognition of seleniferous plants, proper
land management, and grazing control are all necessary to completely
prevent selenosis. - Mod.TG]
