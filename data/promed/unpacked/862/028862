On 6 Jan 2019, a 45-year old female (pregnant woman) and her 2 family members, residents of Dandapauwa-6, Ramkot, Kathmandu [Province Three] visited the OPD [outpatient department] of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease hospital, with a 4-day history of fever, cough, sore throat, chest pain, and weakness.

According to them, they have a poultry chicken farm, where nearly 700 chickens have died in the last one-week alone and are still dying (dying in a rate of approx 150/day). According to them, chickens are showing symptoms of coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and dying quickly. Chickens were tested positive for influenza A by rapid diagnostic test.

Samples were further sent to higher center to identify its subtypes.

It is not yet known whether visiting patients were also contracted with avian influenza virus, because they also developed influenza-like illness soon after their chicken have died of flu like symptoms. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus is concurrently circulating in Kathmandu. We, however, must not underestimate H5N1 and H7N9 or even new subtypes of avian influenza, a growing public health threat to human health.

[ProMED thanks Dr Sher Bahadur Pun for this report. The history of the cases is suggestive of exposure to sick and dead poultry with symptoms of respiratory illness, confirmed as influenza A (subtype not available).

Since this is currently the influenza season in Nepal as well, the diagnosis of seasonal or novel/avian influenza subtype remain to be determined in these cases.

Any information on further clinical course or laboratory tests from these cases would be highly appreciated. - Mod.UBA]

[The zoonotic avian influenza strain HPAI H5N1 has reportedly been circulating in Nepal during 2018; last outbreak, affecting poultry, was reported in June 2018. Recently, the said strain has been reported from a backyard poultry farm in India's northern state Bihar, bordering Nepal. This virus is known to be active seasonally, synchronized with the bird migration season.

Its possible current circulation in Nepal is suspected; results of tests performed in samples from the farm mentioned in the current report will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
