Fungus halves ginger harvest
----------------------------
A fungus devastating the multi-million dollar Sunshine Coast ginger
crop may force manufacturer Buderim Ginger to import product in 2011.
The company received only 50 percent of its expected 1st crop intake
for 2010 because of the impact of the naturally occurring pythium soft
rot fungus. The 2nd intake, which provides drying ginger for the
brewed drink market, may be only a third of the expected volume.

The industry, with the State and Federal Governments, has jointly
funded research into a cure for the disease, which is prevalent
worldwide but only began to appear in Australian crops 3 years ago.
Growers are also exploring the potential of buying [more] land to
allow greater crop rotation.

Buderim Ginger said that a surplus of product last season [2009] meant
that 2010 shortfalls would be covered to meet market demand. But
another bad season would require a significant import of either
Chinese or Taiwanese ginger. It was unlikely research could deliver
solutions by 2011.

A grower said the impact of the fungus differed from farm to farm but
was significant to the industry.

[Pythium soft rot is the most serious disease of ginger (_Zingiber
officinalis_) in many countries where the crop is grown. It is caused
by fungi in the genus _Pythium_ (_P. aphanidermatum_ and other
species). The disease has been reported to destroy up to 90 percent of
the annual crop. Symptoms include rotting of shoot bases, yellowing
and drying up of leaves, collapse of shoots, and rotting of rhizomes.
The disease is favoured by high soil moisture.

The pathogens are spread with infected materials including soil and
plant debris, by mechanical means and water. Disease management
includes the use of well-drained planting sites, crop rotation, and
preventative fungicide treatments of rhizomes for planting. All of the
commercial ginger germplasm available today is highly susceptible, but
the related ornamental _Z. zerumbet_ was identified as a potential
source of genetic resistance.

In Australia, the disease was first reported in the 2007/08 season and
_P. myriotylum_ appears to be the major cause. Under favourable
conditions [for the pathogen], the disease can destroy rhizomes in 1-2
weeks and spread very quickly. Yield losses of up 30 percent are
reported in some fields, while others are completely destroyed.
