----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rates of listeriosis have been increasing in Scandinavia for over 20 years, and are currently 2- to 5-fold higher than those reported in the United States -- see graph (black arrow = USA) (1-3), http://cdn.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/ListeriaSweden.png).

The CDC estimates that the average annual incidence of listeriosis in the United States was 0.29 cases per 100 000 population for 2009-2011 and has remained relatively stable since 2001 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6222a4.htm?s_cid=mm6222a4_w). Almost all listeriosis occurs in persons in higher-risk groups (the elderly, pregnant women, newborns, and immunocompromised persons) and in the USA most cases of listeriosis occur in the age group over 65 years (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6222a4.htm?s_cid=mm6222a4_w).

A possible reason for the higher and increasing incidence of listeriosis in Scandinavian countries includes increasingly more people at risk of invasive listeriosis in these countries, for example, an increasingly aged population. However, in Denmark at least, the incidence of listeriosis has risen substantially within the age group of over 70-year-olds, so demographic changes alone do not explain the increase (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19522).

Another possible explanation is increasing exposure to _Listeria monocytogenes_ because of increasing levels of food contamination or increased consumption of contaminated food. _L. monocytogenes_ is frequently present in raw foods of both plant and animal origin and may be also present in cooked foods if contaminated after cooking. Even if _L. monocytogenes_ is initially present at a low level in a contaminated food, because of its ability to grow during refrigerated storage, levels of contamination are likely to increase during refrigerated storage of those foods that can support the growth of the microorganism.

Listeriosis outbreaks have been frequently attributed to refrigerated ready-to-eat food (RTE) (such as, such as pate, cold cut meats, and fish) that is eaten without further cooking. In fact, consumer surveys from Statistics Denmark, comparing the period from 2005 to 2007 with the period from 2003 to 2005, indicate that expenditures for RTE products have increased by 87 percent for RTE meat products and by 34 percent for RTE fish products among individuals older than 60 years and living alone (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19522). - Mod.ML
