The following background data on Japanese encephalitis in Taiwan were
extracted from the GIDEON software program:
Most cases during the rainy and early dry season, in rural pig-raising
areas, with highest incidence in the Taipei and Kaohsiung-Pingtung river
basins. The disease is also common in the area extending from Taoyuan,
Hsinchu and Miaoli to the central Taiwan and Chiayi-Tainan plains.
Highest rates are registered among children 2 to 5 years old. 40% of
non-immunized rural children in Hsinchu, Taichung, Pingtung and Hualien are
seropositive by age 6 years. Virtually all pigs are seropositive by mid-May.
Universal vaccination has been administered since 1968, and given from age
15 months.
The disease rate was 7.7/100,000 in 1960. 127 cases were reported during
1986 to 1990, including cases from Taipei; 25 cases in 1991; 185 in 1993;
214 in 1994 (52 of these from Taipei). 289 cases (27 confirmed) were
reported in 1995; 327 (19 confirmed) in
1996; 322 (5 confirmed) in 1997.
Principal vectors include _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_, _C. annulus_ and _C.
fuscocephalus_. _Alrmigeres sulbalbatis_ has been implicated as a potential
vector in paddy-free areas.
