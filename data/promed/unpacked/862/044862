Epidemiology - Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection:
Contact with infected animal(s) at grazing/watering

Epidemiological comments: On 7 Dec 2010, the Glanders Committee
started the 2nd surveillance for all equine species (horses, mules,
donkeys and ponies) and camels which share the same stables and
divided the country into 2 parts, North and South, as per the Strategy
Plan agreed by the European Union. The surveillance began firstly in
the areas where the infected horses were found in the 1st round and
samples taken were tested by CFT and c-ELISA by the OIE reference
laboratory (CVRL) and the Bahrain National Veterinary Laboratory. By
the end of December [2010], 4 horses were isolated under observation
because the results were not accurate (which means CFT-negative and
c-ELISA positive or the opposite with no clinical signs.I

In the Southern part all equines were tested twice by CFT and c-ELISA
at the CVRL and they were all negative. In the Northern part all
equines were also tested by CFT and c-ELISA and just 4 cases were
found. These 4 cases were notified to the OIE after the CVRL completed
the DNA matching to identify the strains. There is a history of
infected horses in the same stables. The stables where cases were
found are put under quarantine for 6 months.

Control measures: Measures applied - Stamping out; Quarantine;
Movement control inside the country; Screening; Zoning
Disinfection of infected premises/establishment

No vaccination; No treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied - No other measures

The following overview of this disease is humans and animals is
extracted from the Iowa State University College of Veterinary
Medicine Center for Food Safety and Public Health. See
http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/glanders.pdf.

Glanders results from infection by _Burkholderia mallei_, a Gram
negative rod in the family Burkholderiaceae. This organism was
formerly known as _Pseudomonas mallei_. Glanders is a serious zoonotic
bacterial disease that primarily affects horses, mules and donkeys.
Some animals die acutely within a few weeks. Others become chronically
infected and can spread the disease for years before succumbing.
Although human disease is uncommon, it is life threatening and
painful. Without antibiotic treatment, the case fatality rate can be
as high as 95 percent. Occasionally, glanders also occurs in other
mammalian species, particularly members of the cat family.

The symptoms of glanders vary with the route of exposure. 4 forms of
the disease -- septicemia, pulmonary infection, acute localized
infection and chronic infection -- have been described in humans. One
form of the disease can progress to another, and combinations of
syndromes occur.

In equids, glanders is traditionally categorized into nasal,
pulmonary and cutaneous forms. In the nasal form, deep ulcers and
nodules occur inside the nasal passages, resulting in a thick,
purulent, yellowish discharge. This discharge may be unilateral or
bilateral, and can become bloody. Nasal perforation is possible. The
regional (submaxillary) lymph nodes become enlarged and indurated, and
may suppurate and drain. Healed ulcers become starÂ­shaped scars. In
the pulmonary form, nodules and abscesses develop in the lungs. Some
infections are inapparent; others vary from mild dyspnea to severe
respiratory disease. In more severe cases, the clinical signs include
coughing, dyspnea, febrile episodes and progressive debilitation.
Diarrhea and polyuria may also be seen. Discharges from pulmonary
abscesses can spread the infection to the upper respiratory tract. In
the cutaneous form, the skin contains nodules that rupture and
ulcerate, discharging an oily, purulent yellow exudate. The regional
lymphatics and lymph nodes become chronically enlarged; the lymphatics
are filled with a purulent exudate. In addition, there may be swelling
of the joints and painful edema of the legs. Glanderous orchitis is a
common symptom in males. Clinical cases are usually a combination of
these forms, and can occur as acute, chronic or latent disease.

Glanders is mainly transmitted by contact with skin exudates and
respiratory secretions from infected equids. Latently infected as well
as clinically ill animals can spread the disease. Horses, mules and
donkeys often become infected when they ingest _B. mallei_ in
contaminated food or water. This organism can also be spread in
aerosols, and by entry through skin abrasions and mucous membranes.
Carnivores usually become infected when they eat contaminated meat.
_B. mallei_ is readily spread on fomites including harnesses, grooming
tools, and food and water troughs.

Humans are infected by contact with sick animals, contaminated
fomites, tissues or bacterial cultures. Transmission is often through
small wounds and abrasions in the skin. Ingestion or inhalation can
also occur. Transmission through unbroken skin has been reported, but
not proven. Most laboratory-acquired infections have occurred during
routine handling of cultures or samples, rather than after injuries or
accidents. Rare cases of person-to-person transmission have been
reported in family members who nursed sick individuals. 2 cases were
thought to have been sexually transmitted.

Glanders was a worldwide problem in equids for several centuries, but
this disease was eradicated from most countries by the mid-1900s.
Outbreaks are now uncommon and reported from limited geographic areas.
In non-endemic regions, cases may be seen in people who work with the
causative organism, _Burkholderia mallei_, in secure laboratories. An
infection was reported in a U.S. researcher in 2000. Glanders is also
considered to be a serious bioterrorist threat. _B. mallei_ has been
weaponized and was used as a biological weapon against military
horses, or animals and humans, during the 1st and 2nd world wars. If
this organism is aerosolized during a biological attack or in a
laboratory accident, the morbidity rate could be high. - Mod.PC]
