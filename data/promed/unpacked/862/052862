Abstract
--------
In November 2014, French public health authorities renewed the recommendation to target for vaccination against invasive meningococcal disease men who have sex with men (MSM) and all individuals 25 years or older attending social venues associated with the gay community. This policy was extended beyond the Paris region as a reaction to the continuing spread of serogroup C isolates belonging to a new lineage within clonal complex cc11 since the recommendation was 1st issued in July 2013.

Introduction
------------
In this report, we describe, based on combined epidemiological surveillance data and genetic typing of serogroup C meningococcal isolates, the spread of a specific invasive strain of meningococcus C (MenC) in the Paris region that had started as an outbreak among men who have sex with men (MSM) in June 2013.

The alert in June 2013
----------------------
In the 1st half of 2013, 14 serogroup C IMD [invasive meningococcal disease] cases were reported in France in 25 to 59 year-old men, while 6 cases were reported in women. Of the adult male cases, 6 affected residents of the Paris region and 3 occurred within one week in early June in MSM. The variable regions 1 and 2 of PorA, the variable region of FetA and the clonal complex (cc) of the 3 isolates were characterised. These isolates showed the genotype C:P1.5-1,10-8:F:3-6:cc11 and belonged to the electrophoretic type (ET) 15 of the cc11 (cc11 harbours several lineages). Between October 2012 and May 2013, 5 serogroup C IMD cases in MSM were also reported in Germany [1], caused by isolates sharing the same characteristics as the ones in France. Further genetic analysis showed that the German and the French isolates shared additional markers that also differed from other lineages of the cc11 isolates (data not shown). These findings raised the question of the emergence of a new clone of serogroup C _Neisseria meningitidis_ in the European MSM community [2]. Considering that serogroup C outbreaks occurred also among MSM in Canada in 2001 and in the United States in 2003 (Chicago [Illinois]) and in 2011-13 (New York City), a rapid risk assessment was prepared by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in July 2013 [3,4].

We established a national enhanced surveillance and prompted the regional public health officers to assess a possible link to the MSM community for all cases infected by C:P1.5-1,10-8:F:3-6:cc11 isolates.

Serogroup C invasive meningococcal disease cases in the Paris region from July 2013 to December 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since July 2013, 34 cases of serogroup C IMD have been notified in the Paris region and 2 other cases have been diagnosed in other countries but were very likely to be linked to a source of exposure in the Paris region. Among these 36 cases, 17 were 25 to 59 years old and 5 were aged 60 years and older. The case fatality rate was 17 percent (6/36). The male/female ratio was 1.6 (22/14) (Table 1). None of the cases had been vaccinated against MenC disease.

Isolates from 29 of the 36 cases were subjected to a complete molecular analysis and 14 were related to the genotype C:P1.5-1,10-8:F3-6:cc11. Among those 14, 9 isolates showed the above-mentioned additional specific markers (Figure 1). They corresponded to 7 men (1 aged 15-24 years and 6 aged 25-59 years) and 2 women (one aged 25-59 years and 1 in the age group 60 years and older). 1 additional male case (15-24 years old) was epidemiologically linked to one of them (family cluster). These 10 cases were directly or indirectly linked to the MSM community (4 cases aged 25-59 years who self-identified as MSM and 6 who did not identify as MSM but attended social venues associated with the gay community in the Paris region).

Incidence rates and risk evaluation
-----------------------------------
When considering all reported serogroup C IMD cases for all age groups and both women and men, no excess of cases was observed in the Paris region compared with the general population of France since July 2013. In contrast, we observed a gradual increase in the incidence of serogroup C IMD in the Paris region since 2013, a trend that was less marked elsewhere in France (Figure 2).

FIGURE 2. Incidence rates of serogroup C invasive meningococcal disease cases France, 2010-14 (n=409)

Moreover, IMD caused by C:P1.5-1,10-8:F3-6:cc11 isolates have increased since 2011 particularly in the Paris region where it represented about half (11/22) of the notified meningococcus C IMD cases in 2014 (vs 12 percent elsewhere in France, p less than 10-3). During the period from 2011 to 2014, the mean annual reporting rate for these isolates was estimated at 0.05 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in the Paris region (vs 0.02 elsewhere in France, p less than 10-3).

In order to estimate the incidence among MSM in the Paris region, we used as the denominator the estimated figures from the 2006 national survey on sexual behaviour [5]. About 175 000 men living in the Paris region and aged 25 to 59 years reported sexual encounters with men at least once during their life.

Taking into account the 4 cases notified in MSM since July 2013, the incidence of serogroup C IMD among 25 to 59 year-old MSM (individuals older than 25 years are not targeted by the national vaccination programme) in the Paris region was 2.28 per 100 000 person-years. The observed number of cases was 10 times greater than the expected number among men in this age group, if the incidence rate of C IMD cases was the same in Paris region than in all regions in France. No excess risk was demonstrated among men living in the Paris region who did not identify as MSM (Table 2).

Public health response and discussion
-------------------------------------
Surveillance of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in France relies on the mandatory reporting of cases to the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (InVS) and the characterisation of invasive strains at the National Reference Centre (NRC) for Meningococci. Combined epidemiological surveillance and genetic typing of meningococcal isolates highlighted an increase of invasive meningococcal disease among MSM. These data suggested that the excess of serogroup C IMD cases among MSM living in the Paris region was linked to the circulation since mid-2013 of C:P1.5-1,10-8:F3-6:cc11 isolates with additional specific markers, not only in MSM but also among individuals (women, as well as those men who do not identify as MSM) who attend social venues associated with the gay community. Following the 1st outbreak reported in June 2013, the French Council of Public Health (HCSP) issued a recommendation for a 3-month period of vaccination, with a meningococcal conjugate C vaccine offered to all MSM aged 25 years and older, living in the Paris region and attending social venues associated with the gay community. This recommendation also included all individuals attending gay festivals during summer 2013 in France [6]. Several health promotion activities were carried out during that summer by associations well-known in the gay community in France, but no vaccination campaign was officially performed. No data are available on the vaccine coverage reached in the targeted population.

Moreover, data from national surveillance highlighted that 2 family clusters of 2 cases each were also reported outside the Paris region in 2014, indicating that such isolates may spread all over the country and not only in the Paris region. Because of the high serogroup C IMD incidence due to the C:P1.5-1,10-8:F3-6:cc11 isolates and the persistence of cases linked to the MSM community, the recommendation was renewed in November 2014 for one year and extended beyond the Paris region to the whole country, targeting MSM and all individuals aged 25 years and older attending social venues associated with the gay community [7]. Vaccination against serogroup C meningococci had been recommended in France since 2010 at the age of 12 months, with a catch-up in children and young adults (13 months to 24 years old). However, the incidence of serogroup C IMD gradually increased between 2010 and 2013, mostly in infants younger than one year and in adults [8]. This increase suggested a lack of vaccine-induced herd immunity to reduce circulation of serogroup C meningococci, caused by low vaccine uptake (56 percent at the age of 2 years and 17 percent among the 15 to 19 year-olds in 2013).

Vaccine policy for targeting 1 to 24 year-olds should be strengthened more efficiently in France. In addition, enhanced microbiological and epidemiological surveillance should be currently maintained for the isolates responsible of continuous spread of invasive MenC among MSM and adults older than 25 years attending social venues associated with the gay community.

[_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease (meningitis and sepsis), is transmitted from person to person via droplets of respiratory secretions, mostly from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers of the microorganism. It is estimated that between 10 to 25 percent of the population carry _N. meningitidis_ at any given time, and the carriage rate may be much higher in epidemic situations. Close and prolonged contact (such as kissing, sneezing, and coughing on someone), living in close quarters or dormitories (military recruits, students), sharing eating or drinking utensils, etc., facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period for meningococcal meningitis is 4 days, ranging between 2 and 10 days (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) carries a high mortality rate if untreated. Even with early and appropriate treatment, patients can die within 24-48 hours.

Outbreaks of IMD have recently occurred among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Germany, Belgium and France caused by a _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C strain with a certain genotype (http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/rapid-risk-assessment-invasive-meningococcal-disease-among-MSM.pdf). Similar outbreaks among MSM caused by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup C have occurred in Canada and the US (see prior ProMED-mail posts).

Molecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of IMD are caused by only a few hypervirulent clonal lineages, whereas the genetic diversity is higher in meningococci recovered from healthy carriers (Claus H, Weinand H, Frosch M, Vogel U. Identification of the hypervirulent lineages of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the ST-8 and ST-11 complexes, by using monoclonal antibodies specific to NmeDI. J Clin Microbiol. 2003; 41(8): 3873-6; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC179822/). We are not told of the HIV status of the cases of IMD among MSM in France.

However, less virulent strains have been reported to cause IMD in immunocompromised HIV-infected patients (Ferreira de Andrade C, Cotrim da Cunha D, Cavalcanti V, de Filippis I. Fatal meningococcal meningitis in a HIV-infected patient caused by serogroup C _Neisseria meningitidis_ belonging to the non-hypervirulent clonal complex ST-60 (cc60). Braz J Infect Dis. 2011; 15(2): 178-80, available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1413-86702011000200017).

Severely immunosuppressed patients with HIV infection and a low CD4 cell count of less than or equal to 200/mm3 are likely to be at greater risk of developing bacterial meningitis (Domingo P, Suarez-Lozano I, Torres F, et al. Bacterial meningitis in HIV-1-infected patients in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2009; 51(5): 582-7; available at http://www.researchgate.net/publication/26279285).

Mass vaccination campaigns have been used to control outbreaks of IMD in MSM ("See Also" below). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has released recommendations for the use of meningococcal vaccines to control outbreaks of serogroup C meningococcal disease (CDC. Control and prevention of serogroup C meningococcal disease: evaluation and management of suspected outbreaks: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). MMWR Recomm Rep. 1997; 46(RR-5): 13-21; available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm). - Mod.ML
