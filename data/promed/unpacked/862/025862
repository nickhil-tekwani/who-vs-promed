[2] South Sudan: vaccination
Date: Sat 8 Dec 2018
Source: WHO Africa [abridged, edited]

The Ministry of Health of the Republic of South Sudan with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), DFID, GAVI vaccine alliance and other partners is set to vaccinate targeted healthcare and frontline workers operating in high risk states bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) against Ebola virus disease (EVD) as part of national preparedness efforts.

To facilitate the process, a training for the vaccination team was incorporated into the micro plan developed by the vaccine technical working group (TWG). The members of the TWG, among others, include MoH, UNICEF, CDC, WHO, MSF, and Health Cluster. Accordingly, a 4-day training program -- Good Clinical Practice (GCP) course -- for 60 participants drawn from the states of Juba, Yei, Yambio, and Nimule was held from 4-7 Dec 2018 in Juba.

The vaccination team members selected by their respective State Ministry of Health included representatives from health facilities, the private sector, and Civil Society Organizations. Each state vaccination team comprised 15 members including vaccinators, clinicians, social mobilizers, and logisticians.

The GCP training is mandatory prior to the administration of the vaccine. Participants were equipped with knowledge and skills on Ebola vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV) administration, including vaccination techniques, through a simulation exercise.

Through this training, the vaccination team members were GCP-certified and are now ready to conduct the Ebola vaccination scheduled to start with Juba on 19 Dec 2018 and to follow up on the vaccinated individuals for a period of 21 days as the minimum standard of care.

The Ministry of Health, with technical support from the Vaccine TWG of the National EVD Task Force, the states, and NGOs operating in health care facilities in the respective states, will coordinate the administration of the Ebola vaccine.

With support from the GAVI vaccine alliance, 2160 doses of the Ebola vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV) have been allocated to South Sudan and will be administered to protect against Ebola virus-Zaire, the strain that is confirmed in the current outbreak in DRC. Although this vaccine is not yet licensed, it is being used under the compassionate-use guidelines in response to the ongoing Ebola outbreak in DRC as recommended by the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE).

Some priority pre-Ebola vaccination activities being implemented include but are not limited to cold chain equipment installation and logistics management, mapping of health facilities, healthcare and frontline workers, and development of the social mobilization messages and educational materials for the vaccination.

South Sudan is one of the 3 countries neighbouring the DRC at very high risk of possible Ebola virus disease importation. The country is on high alert, and no confirmed case has been detected as of 8 Dec 2018.

The implementation of the EVD preparedness contingency plan in high risk areas with support from partners continues. These include entry screening of travellers at selected points of entry; health facility and community-based EVD surveillance; risk communication, and community engagement. Capacity for infection prevention and control, case management, and for safe and dignified burials is also being enhanced.

[This is an excellent preemptive measure. Even were this Ebola outbreak to be terminated before the virus spreads internationally, which would be wonderful, there will be outbreaks in the future where first-line responders who are already vaccinated will be very valuable. - Mod.LK
