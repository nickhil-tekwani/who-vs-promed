China has contained an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in
northwestern Gansu Province, the Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday,
the 2nd case of the disease in the province in 2007.
The Ministry of Agriculture said 423 cattle and 117 sheep had been culled
on a farm in Jingtai County after 18 head of cattle showed signs of illness
on 28 Jan 2007, the report said.
The infected cattle were diagnosed with Asia Type One FMD by the National
FMD Reference Laboratory on Friday, Xinhua said.
Last month, China slaughtered 89 cattle in another case of FMD in Gansu
Province, and 73 cattle were culled after an outbreak in the far western
region of Xinjiang.
