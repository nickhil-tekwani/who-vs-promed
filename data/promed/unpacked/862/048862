Ethiopia sounds alarm over new malaria prone areas
--------------------------------------------------
The Ethiopian Ministry of Health (MoH) has
sounded concerns over outbreaks of malaria in
areas where the disease was previously not found.

A replacement program for insecticide-treated
mosquito nets has had to be altered to
incorporate the new areas. The ministry had
bought a 2nd round of insecticide-treated bed
nets to replace the previously distributed 20
million nets that have a life span of 3 to 5
years, according to government sources.

However, the presence of malaria in previously
inactive places has forced the ministry to change
its plan to replace the 20 million nets and
commenced distribution to people living in
newly-identified places, the source said.

Climate fluctuation has been identified by MoH
officials as one of the principal reasons for the latest possible outbreak.

The mosquito net measure, taken since 2005 by the
ministry in collaboration with the Roll Back
Malaria Initiative, in which UNICEF and WHO are
partners, has brought about significant change.

But, despite Ethiopia's extensive
malaria-fighting measures, the mosquito parasite
induced sickness remains the most fatal disease
in Ethiopia. According to UNICEF "large scale
epidemics occur every 5 to 8 years in certain
areas aggravated by climatic fluctuations and
drought-related emergencies that weaken people's immune system."

In 2003 a major epidemic was registered, during
which an estimated 6 million cases and more than 40 000 deaths were recorded.

The Ethiopian Ministry of Health, in the course
of the programme, stretched its health services
as it dispatched more than 30 000 health
extension workers and distributed about 20
million bed nets to malaria prone areas.

This effort contributed to a dramatic fall in
deaths from a disease that kills one in 4 people.
The program halved malaria morbidity and mortality within 3 years.

There are 2 transmission seasons in Ethiopia: the
1st begins in April following the belg rains and
the 2nd in October, which also follows the
country's main regular rainy season, according to
information obtained from WHO Ethiopia.

Tedros Adhanom, Ethiopian Health Minister, has
expressed his concerns over the new outbreak. As
chairman of the international Roll Back Malaria
initiative, Tedros Adhanom has been using his
country's malaria-fighting model to inspire other African countries.

[Highlands are more prone to changes in malaria
transmission than low land areas because a few
degrees changes can dramatically change
transmission (Zhou G et al. Association between
