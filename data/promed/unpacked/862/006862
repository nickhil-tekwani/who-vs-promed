Russia (Samarskaya Oblast): cases of hantavirus infection in Tolyatti
---------------------------------------------------------------------
7 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) were registered
last week in Tolyatti. Chief sanitary physician of the Sanitary
Epidemiological Surveillance Center, Vladimir Drobishev, stated that this
number of HFRS cases is a matter of concern for the city. According to the
opinions of sanitary physicians, this outbreak can be explained by the fact
that rodents -- in order to protect themselves from the cold -- are seeking
warmth and thus come into close contact with people in their homes. This
situation increases the risk of infection for humans. According to the
website "Samara today", no rodent control measures have been implemented
since the year 2000. Thus rodents have had favorable conditions for their
multiplication. According to Drobishev all 7 cases [exhibited typical
symptoms of HFRS, but there had been no fatalities].

[Several members of the genus _Hantavirus_ (family _Bunyaviridae_) have
been associated with cases of HFRS in Russia and elsewhere; these include
Hantaan virus, Dobrava-Belgrade virus, Seoul virus, and Puumala virus, each
of which has a different rodent reservoir host. HFRS is a disease long
recognized in Asia, and a viral etiology was first suggested by Russian and
Japanese investigators in the early 1940s. Hantaviruses are primarily
rodentborne, but no arthropod vector is involved in their transmission.
Transmission occurs predominantly by inhalation of virus contaminated
rodent excreta. Human to human transmission does not occur except under
exceptional circumstances. - Mod.CP]
