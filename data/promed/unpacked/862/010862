Japan remains in the grip of rubella infections [German measles] with the disease spreading rapidly, and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases reports that 5442 people were diagnosed with rubella during January-April this year [2013].

The infections are 34 times more than that of the same period last year [2012], the Institute said, adding that the number of new infections had been rising by more than 500 per week since the beginning of April [2013].

Nearly 90 percent of the patients are aged 20 or above, most of them men in their 20s to 40s or women in their 20s.

Health authorities are calling for caution, as babies born to women who contract the disease during early pregnancy may develop severe eye, ear, or heart problems. Adults are urged to get vaccinated, as the disease is likely to peak around June, Japan's NHK broadcaster reported on Wednesday [8 May 2013].

[There seems no end in sight to the current outbreak of rubella virus infection in Japan. The high frequency of rubella virus infection in Japan, and its predominance in males, appears to be consequence of previous vaccination policies as recounted in a previous ProMED-mail post (Rubella - Japan (03): vaccination policy 20130321.1597149). The previously expressed travel warning for travellers to Japan (see ProMED-mail Rubella - Japan (04): travel alert 20130406.1626811) is more relevant that ever.

Rubella illness is generally mild in children, however it has serious consequences in pregnant women, causing fetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). WHO recommends that all countries that have not yet introduced rubella vaccine should consider to do so using existing well-established measles immunization programmes.

In April 2012, the Measles Initiative -- now known as the Measles & Rubella Initiative -- launched a new Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan which covers the period 2012-2020. The Plan includes new global goals for 2015 and 2020.
By the end of 2015:
- Reduce global measles deaths by at least 95 percent compared with 2000 levels.
- Achieve regional measles and rubella/congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) elimination goals.
By the end of 2020:
- Achieve measles and rubella elimination in at least 5 WHO regions. - Mod.CP
