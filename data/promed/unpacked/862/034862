The Robert Koch Institute [RKI], as well as the Federal Institute for
Risk Assessment, advised, as a precautionary measure until further
notice do not consume tomatoes, cucumbers, or leaf salads from
northern Germany.

Meanwhile the number of serious diseases increases. A total of 4
people have died so far. [One of the deaths may not have been caused
by the VTEC infection - Mod.LL] Nationwide, the RKI according to its
own information already reported around 140 cases of hemolytic uremic
syndrome (HUS). One day earlier. the RKI had reported only 80 HUS
cases. The high number of severe course of EHEC [enterohemorrhagic
_Escherichia coli_ ] infection is extremely unusual.

German scientists are scrambling to find the source of an outbreak of
enterohemorrhagic _Escherichia coli_ (EHEC), a dangerous intestinal
pathogen that has sent hundreds of people to the hospital with bloody
diarrhea. The investigation is complicated by the fact that the
outbreak has apparently been caused by a very rare EHEC serotype
called O104.

"I hope that more patient samples will be identified today, but it
certainly looks as if an _E. coli_ O104 is the cause of these
infections," says Klaus Stark, head of the division of
gastrointestinal infections, zoonoses, and tropical infections at
Robert Koch Institute (RKI) [in Berlin], the German center for disease
prevention and control.

According to RKI, nearly 140 patients in Germany have developed HUS
[hemolytic uremic syndrome] since the 2nd week of May 2011, compared
with only about 60 cases in an average year. "This is one of the
biggest EHEC outbreaks in the world, certainly the biggest one we have
ever had in Germany," says Stark.

Scientists have been baffled not only by the outbreak's size and
rapid spread in northern Germany but also by the fact that it affects
mostly adults and females, an odd pattern because EHEC usually sickens
children. Of the 65 HUS cases in Germany in 2010, only 6 patients were
more than 18 years old.

Being caused by O104 makes the outbreak highly unusual, says Helge
Karch, head of the National Consulting Laboratory on Hemolytic Uremic
Syndrome in Munich. Among Karch's _E. coli_ isolates from 588 HUS
patients collected over the past 20 years, only 2 were O104. In
another unusual twist, Karch has found the strain to be eae-negative.
The gene eae codes for the protein intimin, which the bacteria uses to
attach to the intestinal wall. Most pathogenic EHEC serogroups are
eae-positive.

It is still unclear whether the serotype might explain the strange
pattern of infections. _E. coli_ O104 first emerged as a pathogen in a
small outbreak in Helena, Montana, USA in early 1994. 4 people
developed abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea. Experts at the CDC
identified a serotype called O104:H21 as the culprit. A CDC
investigation later found up to 18 patients; most of them were women
and the median age was 36 years.

The source of infection in Germany is still unclear, and the rare
serotype could make it harder for authorities to find it. "O104 is
very hard to distinguish from normal, non-pathogenic _E. coli_," says
Lothar Beutin, head of the National Reference Laboratory for _E. coli_
at the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment here. He and other
researchers are now trying to develop a more rapid and specific test
for the rare serotype.

[It appears that some preliminary information has suggested a salad
vehicle and ProMED-mail awaits more information about this impressive
epidemic caused by an unusual verotoxin producing _E. coli_. In one
day, the number of cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome related to the
VTEC infection has risen from 80 to 140. - Mod.LL]
