Epidemiological variables can affect the role of WN vectors
------------------------------------------------
The newly reported hybridization between _Cx. pipiens_ s.s and _Cx.
pipiens_ form _molestus_ may have played a role in the highly
successful establishment of WNV in New York City in 1999 and its
subsequent spread in the northeastern and north-central USA, where
this species is the predominant enzootic vector. But at least 43
other mosquito species have been found infected with the virus and
are competent vectors in the laboratory; and the largest outbreaks in
the USA have been observed in the western states where _Culex
tarsalis_is the predominant vector. [Calculation of] risk of
arbovirus infections in humans has to take into account vector
competence, vector density in relation to its hosts, biting
frequency, and longevity.
Certainly, the rapid spread of WNV in the USA, Canada, and Mexico and
the contrast between virus activity in the USA and Europe cannot be
attributed to the genetics of _Cx. pipiens_ complex mosquitoes alone.
One also must take ito account differences in circulating virus
strains, differences in historical exposure to the virus, and
differences in vertebrate host competency.
Further research is needed to determine whether there is a
correlation between the genetic, behavioral, and biological traits of
_Cx. pipiens_. Recent studies conducted by Kramer et al. in NYS
(unpublished data) have demonstrated spatial and temporal variation
in vector competence of _Cx. pipiens_. Additional studies are in
progress to determine whether these differences correlate with _Cx.
pipiens_ population genetics and other biological traits, since the
exact type of hybrid (as Fonseca et al. noted) present in an area
might be a cause of the observed differences. A dynamic distribution
of hybrids with accompanying variation in their vector competence and
feeding behavior would provide an excellent opportunity to examine
the genetic basis of these 2 traits and the epidemiological
consequences for WNV of the interaction between genetic and
environmental variables.

[We are most grateful to Dr Kramer for emphasizing the complexity of
the epidemiology of West Nile in the USA and drawing attention to the
many variables that can affect vector competence. This helps to
clarify the news report on hybrid mosquitoes and West Nile virus
