Abstract
--------
Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa have experienced lower COVID-19 caseloads and fewer deaths than countries in other regions worldwide. Under-reporting of cases and a younger population could partly account for these differences, but pre-existing immunity to coronaviruses is another potential factor. Blood samples from Sierra Leonean Lassa fever and Ebola survivors and their contacts collected before the first reported COVID-19 cases were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the presence of antibodies binding to proteins of coronaviruses that infect humans. Results were compared to COVID-19 subjects and healthy blood donors from the United States. Prior to the pandemic, Sierra Leoneans had more frequent exposures than Americans to coronaviruses with epitopes that cross-react with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The percentage of Sierra Leoneans with antibodies reacting to seasonal coronaviruses was also higher than for American blood donors. Serological responses to coronaviruses by Sierra Leoneans did not differ by age or sex. Approximately 1/4 of Sierra Leonian pre-pandemic blood samples had neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, while about 1/3 neutralized MERS-CoV pseudovirus. Prior exposures to coronaviruses that induce cross-protective immunity may contribute to reduced COVID-19 cases and deaths in Sierra Leone.

Introduction
------------
We demonstrate that, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the percentage of Sierra Leonians with cross-reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and seasonal coronaviruses was higher than in United States blood donors.

Conclusions
-----------
Pre-existing immunity to coronavirus antigens should be further investigated as a potential factor contributing to reduced caseloads and deaths from COVID-19 in Sierra Leone. It is likely that humans in Sierra Leone are frequently exposed to SARS-related and MERS-related viruses. Studies should be conducted to fully characterize immune responses directed against coronaviruses by Sierra Leoneans. Several studies have reported T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in people with no known exposure to the virus, which may in part be related to prior exposure to seasonal coronaviruses. It is possible that cellular immunity to endemic coronaviruses also has a protective role. Studies to access the prevalence of humoral and cellular immunity to coronaviruses are needed in other African countries with low reported incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Equitable COVID-19 vaccine distribution should continue even in countries with currently low numbers of cases and deaths. The role of both natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity should be investigated in these populations. Another priority for future research will be to define the diversity of coronaviruses that circulate in humans or frequently spillover from animals to humans living in Sierra Leone and other West African countries.

[Cross-protection from prior infection with SARS-related and MERS-related viruses may very well contribute to the lower number of cases of COVID observed in sub-Saharan Africa than in populations unexposed to these viruses. Other factors certainly must be considered, such as demographics of the population, but protective immunity in the population should be pursued further. - Mod.LK]

Total number of worldwide cases: 257 832 881
Number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours: 399 841

[In the past 24 hours, 11 countries including the UK (40 004), Russia (36 970), Germany (36 860), the USA (27 484), Turkey (21 177), the Netherlands (20 643), France (19 749), Poland (18 924), Czech Republic (14 408), Austria (14 042), and Ukraine (10 635) all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 4355 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 19 Nov 2021 to late 20 Nov 2021). A total of 45 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 26 of the 53 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, and 1 is from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 11.4%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 4.7%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 16.7% increase in daily reported cases and an 88.6% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report is approximately 400 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 257.83 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.16 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
