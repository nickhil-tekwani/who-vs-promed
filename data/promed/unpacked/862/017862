The ongoing intensive search for wild boar in the area of Germany affected by African swine fever (ASF) suggests the virus has been in the Brandenburg since early July [2020].

The Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI) confirmed 2 more cases in wild boar in the Spree-Neisse district on Thursday [1 Oct 2020], taking the total number of confirmed outbreaks in Brandenburg to 40. [During the afternoon of Friday 2 Oct 2020, FLI tweeted: "6 more cases of ASF have been confirmed in wild boar in Brandenburg. The sites are in the initial core area. There are now 46 confirmed cases in total -- all in wild boar." Thanks to Sabine Zentis. - Mod.AS]

The latest cases were found within the original core area, but, in another highly significant development on Wednesday [30 Sep 2020], the FLI confirmed a case in a young boar near the German-Polish border at Bleyen, about 60 km [about 37 mi] from the previously affected districts (see the FLI map at the source URL above).

The case is not thought to be directly linked to the original districts. According to the FLI's preliminary assessment, it is likely to be a new introduction of ASF from the affected regions in western Poland.

"Thus there are 2 outbreaks in Brandenburg and the competent authorities are taking the appropriate measures (buffer zone, sensitive area, core area)," the FLI said.

Meanwhile, the intensive search for fallen game continues in the 'endangered area', including the use of drones and human chains, Brandenburg's State Secretary for Consumers, Anna Heyer-Stuffer said.

Among the carcases found and sampled, there were 4 skeletons without tissue in the hotspot Dorchetal area in the south west of Neuzelle (Oder-Spree), German pig organisation ISN reports.

As part of the 1st epidemiological outbreak investigations, the FLI said last week that it is estimated that these 4 carcases must have been around for 8 to 10 weeks before they were discovered. It can therefore be assumed that the epidemic was introduced in the 1st half of July [2020].

These research results were presented and discussed at the meeting of the state crisis team on 25 Sep [2020] in Potsdam.

The ASF state crisis centre in Potsdam, working with local teams, is currently preparing to establish a so-called white zone around the 1st core area of Sembten Neuzelle, ISN reports. This will form a strip at least 5 km [3 mi] deep around the core area with an area of more than 200 sq km [about 77.2 sq mi]. This zone will be secured with solid, wild boar-proof fences.

The preparations for building the fence are nearly completed. "As soon as this white zone is secured with solid fences, the number of wild boars should be greatly reduced," ISN said.

[As it appears, thanks to FLI's [Friedrich Loeffler Institute's] impressive, intensive epidemiological investigation, the introduction of ASF virus into Germany's territory was detected -- infecting the local wild boar population -- about 2 months before the 1st detection of a dead wild boar. High pathogenicity and short incubation may -- hopefully -- have contributed to limit the spread range, currently coined "the 1st core area of Sembten Neuzelle."

A 2nd introduction/outbreak is concerning. To see the geographic situation of both outbreaks, please visit OIE's interactive ASF outbreak map (global) at https://tinyurl.com/yy49z8p7 (click, to center, on the German/Polish cluster, zoom in to the required resolution). The initial cluster faces the Polish province of Lobuskie; the new outbreak, about 50 km (31 mi) northwards, is close to the division line between Lobuskie and its northern neighbor province in Poland, Zachodnio-Pomorskie. According to the map, no ASF cases in wild boar have been reported from this Polish region.

Information on the surveillance activities, undertaken there so far, addressing the territories of both provinces, will be helpful. - Mod.AS
