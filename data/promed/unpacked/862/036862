Local authorities are performing control activities aimed at dogs in the different communes of Neiva district [Huila department], in order to reduce the number of cases of visceral leishmaniasis in the department.

Dr Gerardo Jose Andrade, a veterinary from the Neiva Health Secretariat, pointed out that although the number of cases (of visceral leishmaniasis) is smaller compared to former years, still some are found in this area.

"We already have 390 samples taken from different communities in Neiva; unfortunately, 10 puppy dogs have been diagnosed with (visceral) leishmaniasis; this condition may be severe in humans, and potentially lethal", Dr Andrade confirmed.

He also mentioned that surveillance is being performed in children less than 5 years old, although he mentioned once again that the number of cases of (visceral) leishmaniasis has decreased.

Dr Andrade confirmed that up to September 2015, 10 dogs have been found with the disease, and control activities will be intensified in the coming days.
