Hawaii records 85th case of dengue fever
----------------------------------------
The Department of Health has identified one more case of dengue fever in
Kane'ohe, bringing the statewide total to 85. The new Kane'ohe patient is
part of a family in which other members already have been identified with
the mosquito-borne disease, according to department officials. As with many
of the cases the department is now reporting, the patient had the disease
some time ago.
There are now 18 confirmed cases on O'ahu, with most of them clustered on
the windward side: 7 of the cases are in Kane'ohe, 5 in La'ie, 3 in
Hau'ula, and there is one in each in Kailua, 'Aiea, and Honolulu. On Maui,
where the disease was first reported, there are 62 cases. Kaua'i has 5.
Health officials are continuing their campaign to encourage residents to
remove standing water around their homes, which is where mosquitoes breed.
