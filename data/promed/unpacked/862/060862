Headlines:
- In the last 6 months, in 3rd place for the total number of cases
and for the number of cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) are 2
countries with outbreaks of imported WPV - Chad for the total number
(52) and Guinea for the number of WPV1 (25). India reported the
highest total number of cases (542) as well as the highest number of
wild poliovirus type 1 (49), followed by Pakistan (61 total, 44
WPV1). Data for 2009 is not yet final.
- Nigeria and Pakistan will be using bivalent oral polio vaccine
(bOPV) within the next 2 months, ([30 Jan 2010] for the former and
possibly [15 Feb 2010] for the latter). With this, all 4 endemic
countries will have deployed the new vaccine within 2 months of each other.

Endemic countries:
Afghanistan:
- Two new cases were reported in the last week (both WPV3), one with
onset in 2009 and one in 2010. The total number of cases for 2009 is
38 and for 2010 is now one. The most recent case had onset of
paralysis on [6 Jan 2010] in Hilmand.
- The December 2009 case is the 1st from Nangarhar Province in the
Eastern Region of Afghanistan since November 2008. While genetic
sequencing is awaited, it is likely that the virus is related to that
circulating in the bordering areas of Pakistan. A mop-up is planned
for the entire province, targeting 400 000 children with bOPV on
[24-26 Jan 2010].
- A major coordinated attack in Kabul this week has affected security
and planning.
- The next SIAs [Supplementary Immunization Activity] are
Sub-national Immunization Days (SNIDs) planned for [14-16 Feb 2010]
in coordination with Pakistan.

India:
- Five new cases were reported in the last week (all WPV3), bringing
the total number of cases for 2009 to 724. The most recent case had
onset of paralysis on [30 Dec 2009] in Bihar.
- A surveillance review for western Uttar Pradesh [UP] is taking
place this week.
- The next NIDs are scheduled for February [2010], with most of the
country using trivalent OPV and mOPV1, mOPV3 and bOPV being used in
different parts of UP and Bihar and adjoining states.

Nigeria:
- No new cases were reported in the last week, so the total number of
cases for 2009 remains 388. The most recent case had onset of
paralysis on [20 Nov 2009] (WPV1 from Kebbi).
- The Northern Traditional and Religious Leaders Forum for Primary
Healthcare and Polio Eradication held their 1st meeting of the year
on [14 Jan 2010], attended by the Federal Minister of Health and the
Executive Director of the National Primary Healthcare Development
Agency. Citing the pivotal role of the traditional leadership in
garnering local support and reaching children, the Minister of Health
said, "What I'm setting for 2010 is collaboration with you, looking
to your leadership. We shall drag polio from Nigeria this year."
- A national EPI/polio eradication review and planning meeting,
including communications, is taking place in Kaduna this week.
- Bivalent OPV is being distributed to states this week for use in
the [30 Jan 2010] nationwide Immunization Plus Days (IPDs). Northern
states will hold a vaccination campaign on [6 Mar 2010] to coordinate
with the 15-country west Africa SIAs.

Pakistan:
- One new case was reported in the last week (WPV1) for 2010, the 1st
case of the year with onset of paralysis on [1 Jan 2010] in North
West Frontier Province. Two new cases (WPV1 and WPV3) were reported
in the last week for 2009, bringing the total number of cases for 2009 to 89.
- The most recent case is a child from Bajour who has never received
OPV. Parts of Bajour have not been covered by a Supplementary
Immunization Activity (SIA) for nearly 2 years because of
inaccessibility due to insecurity.
- The Sub-national Immunization Days (SNIDs) were launched on [18 Jan
2010] with high-level participation including the President and the
Minister of Health as well as senior political leadership in Lahore.
- Two initiatives are being explored in meetings this week: the 1st
to pilot community-based polio eradication activities for
surveillance and social mobilization in select areas of NWFP; and the
2nd to improve the involvement of the Pathan community in Karachi.
- Instead of a high-level technical consultation, a planning meeting
is now scheduled in Islamabad on [8-9 Feb 2010] to focus on the 15
districts with persistent transmission, to be followed by an
inter-provincial advocacy meeting.
- The next NIDs are planned for [15-17 Feb 2010], possibly using bOPV
and coordinated with SNIDs in southern Afghanistan.

Importation countries:
Angola:
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2009 remains 29. The most recent case had onset of

[From the update reports available on the polioeradication.org
website, it appears as though there has been significant progress
during 2009 vis a vis potential interruption of transmission of the
wild poliovirus (WPV) in Nigeria. As Nigeria has been a significant
exporter of the wild poliovirus in the African region, this should
have a major impact. As a reminder, pre-2004, most of the African
countries had interrupted WPV transmission. As a result of decreased
vaccination acceptance in Northern Nigeria, during the ensuing years,
there has been identification of WPV associated polio cases in many
of the countries that have been genetically linked the WPVs
circulating in Nigeria.

Of the 23 countries that have identified WPV associated polio cases
with dates of onset in 2009, 14 involved only WPV1, and 9 involved
WPV1 and WPV3 (there were 3 countries that identified WPV3 during
2008, but not during 2009). (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf> for a
table of wild poliovirus isolates by country 2000 through 2010.).

The 4 countries that are endemic for polio are Afghanistan, India,
Pakistan and Nigeria. Three of these 4 countries continue to have
areas of civil strife that impact on vaccination activities. As the
above reports suggest, there are other countries with civil strife
ongoing where vaccination activities have been impacted, and where
WPV has been re-introduced.

the period 20 Jul 2009 through 19 Jan 2010, see
