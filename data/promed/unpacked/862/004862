Poliomyelitis in Indonesia - update 14 -- 30 Sep 2005
---------------------------------
11 new poliovirus cases were confirmed today from Banten, Lampung and
Central Java provinces. This brings the total number of poliovirus cases to
251.
Lampung and Central Java provinces were not included in 2 emergency
vaccination campaigns held on 31 May and 28 Jun [2005]. The 1st round of
the National Immunization Days (NIDs) was held on 30 Aug [2005]; the 2nd
round was conducted on 27 Sep [2005], targeting each time 24.4 million
children less than 5 years of age throughout the country.
Prior to this outbreak (caused by an importation of type 1 wild
poliovirus), Indonesia had not had a wild poliovirus case since 1995.

[This represents an increase of 26 cases since our last update on 24 Aug
2005 (see refs below).
According to the WHO South East Asian Regional Office (SEARO) website,
there have been a total of 271 cases reported in Indonesia in 2005 of which
20 are type 1 Vaccine-Derived Polioviruses (VDPV) from Madura Island in
East Java that are under investigation.
<http://w3.whosea.org/EN/Section1226.asp>
Hence, the total mentioned on the WHO update provided above excludes the 20
cases associated with VDPV. The remaining isolates identified have been
wild poliovirus type 1. Of note, Lampung province is located on the island
of Sumatra, where there had been 2 prior cases reported.
The above report suggests that there was continued circulation of wild
poliovirus on the islands of Java and in the southeasternmost province of
Sumatra (Lampung). Of concern is the report of 20 type 1 VDPV isolates
from Maduar Island in East Java. More information on this apparent
cluster/outbreak of VDPV would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. -
