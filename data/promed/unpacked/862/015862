Local media reports from Kansas City, Missouri, indicate that a rarely seen -- and not yet well understood -- respiratory virus, human enterovirus 68 (HEV68), has sickened hundreds of kids in the region this week [week ending 29 Aug 2014], and that the local Children's Hospital is unusually at full census in late August. Without specifying the pathogen, Children's Mercy Hospital posted the following notice yesterday on their website: "Viruses in the Community Prompt Inpatient Visiting Restrictions" (http://www.childrensmercy.org/About_Us/Newsroom/Latest_News/Headlines/Viruses_in_the_Community_Prompt_Inpatient_Visiting_Restrictions/).

Enteroviruses encompass a large family of small RNA viruses that include the 3 polioviruses, along with myriad [numerous] non-polio serotypes of human rhinoviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, as well as human, porcine, and simian enteroviruses. According to the CDC, non-polio enteroviruses (NPEVs) cause 10 to 15 million -- mostly mild and often asymptomatic -- infections in the United States [and elsewhere] each year, primarily among infants, children, and teenagers. Fever, runny nose, sneezing, coughing, a skin rash or mouth blisters, and body and muscle aches are the most commonly reported symptoms.

First isolated in 1962, HEV68 (genus _Enterovirus_, family _Picornaviridae_, species HEV-D) has only rarely been identified over the years. In 2011, there were clusters of HEV 68 respiratory infections; whereas in the period 2008-2010, half a dozen HEV68 associated clusters were observed and reported elsewhere in Asia, Europe, and the United States.

HEV68 infection was associated with respiratory illness ranging from relatively mild illness that did not require hospitalization to severe illness requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation. 3 cases, 2 in the Philippines and 1 in Japan, were fatal. In these 6 clusters, HEV68 disproportionately occurred among children. This report highlights HEV68 as an increasingly recognised cause of respiratory illness. Clinicians should be aware of HEV68 as one of many causes of viral respiratory disease and should report clusters of unexplained respiratory illness to the appropriate public health agency.

The spectrum of illness caused by HEV68 remains unclear. HEV68, like other enteroviruses, has been associated with central nervous system disease (9 cases). Further investigation could help clarify the epidemiology and spectrum of disease caused by HEV68. Some diagnostic tests might not detect HEV68 or might misidentify it as an HRV [human rhinovirus].

[According to the CDC (See: Centers for Disease Prevention and Control "Clusters of Acute Respiratory Illness Associated with Human Enterovirus 68 -- Asia, Europe, and United States, 2008-2010" MMWR Weekly, 30 Sep 2011 / 60(38);1301-1304 http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6038a1.htm), in recent years, there have been several clusters of respiratory illness associated with human enterovirus 68 (HEV68), including severe disease. HEV68 is a unique enterovirus that shares epidemiologic and biologic features with human rhinoviruses (HRV). First isolated in California in 1962 from 4 children with bronchiolitis and pneumonia, HEV68 has been reported infrequently since that time and the full spectrum of illness that it can cause is unknown. Clusters of respiratory illness associated with HEV68 have been described in Asia, Europe, and the United States during the period 2008-2010.

CDC learned of clusters of HEV68 from public health agencies requesting consultation or diagnostic assistance and from reports presented at scientific conferences. In each cluster, HEV68 was diagnosed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing targeting the 5'-non-translated region, followed by partial sequencing of the structural protein genes, VP4-VP2, VP1, or both, to give definitive, enterovirus type-specific information.

In the United Sates the 1st detailed study was undertaken in Georgia and subsequent detailed analyses in Pennsylvania and Arizona revealed that HEV68 was frequently detected among pediatric admissions for respiratory illness. Abnormal lung examination result and wheezing, particularly new-onset wheezing, were noted. At least half of children with available chest radiographs had infiltrates. Hospitalization lasted a median of 1.5 days, and no deaths were reported. Despite viral testing and blood cultures performed at the Arizona Department of Health Services on patients with specimens available, no pathogen was detected. Nasopharyngeal specimens of 7 patients were sent to CDC for further testing, and HEV68 was identified in 5 of the patients, one of whom also was positive by RT-PCR testing for _Streptococcus pneumoniae_.

It is apparent from the preceding report that HEV68 may have been responsible for the current situation in Kansas City. This is not an unexpected event as it is now well established that HEV68 has been responsible for many similar outbreaks globally. Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment available at present.

As pointed out by a correspondent previously, this virus should not now be ranked as a novel pathogen. - Mod.CP
