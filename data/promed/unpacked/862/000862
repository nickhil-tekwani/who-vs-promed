Michael Bevan, at the John Innes Centre, Norwich UK, writes that the list
of organisms whose genomes have been sequenced is growing fast. The latest
addition comes from a Brazilian consortium: the organism concerned is
_Xylella fastidiosa_, a bacterium that attacks citrus trees.
Genome sequencing is a potent new tool in the biologist's armoury, and it
is being applied to a wide variety of organisms that directly or indirectly
affect food supplies. Recently, a Brazilian sequencing consortium reported
the first public sequence of a free-living plant pathogen. The organism
concerned is the bacterium _Xylella fastidiosa_, the cause of citrus
variegated chlorosis, a serious disease of citrus fruit. Certain strains of
_X. fastidiosa_ also affect other commercially important produce such as
coffee, nuts and other fruits (2).
The _X. fastidiosa_ genome sequence is one of 24 complete bacterial genomes
now available (3). Each reveals a gene complement and organization that
reflects in marvellous detail the specific adaptations and lifestyles of
the organism concerned.
The _X. fastidiosa_ bacterium is highly specialized. It multiplies in the
foregut of sharpshooter leafhoppers, which feed on sap in a plant's xylem,
the main water-conducting tissue. The insect vector delivers bacteria
directly into the xylem system of host plants. There they multiply and
cause symptoms of chlorosis (chlorophyll loss and yellowing) and the
premature production of inedible fruit. The disease is potentially
devastating; the most effective control is to produce healthy bacteria-free
material for plant propagation. Brazil produces around one-third of the
world's orange fruit, and nearly half of the orange-juice concentrate.
Research into disease control has a high national priority.
The gene complement of _X. fastidiosa_ reflects its life in plant xylem in
three main ways. First, the bacterium is adapted to use a variety of free
sugars found in xylem sap, and to supplement these sugars with glucose
derived from the breakdown of cellulose, the main component of plant cell
walls. Interestingly, genes encoding the enzymes needed to make sugars from
amino acids and other metabolites are missing; this shows that the organism
has a strict requirement for carbohydrates as the sole energy provider and
source of building blocks for all biosynthetic reactions.
Second, no fewer than 67 genes are devoted to the uptake of iron and other
transition metals from xylem sap, and the authors suggest that depletion of
these micronutrients contributes to symptoms of infection.
Third, _X. fastidiosa_ produces two distinct cell-adhesion systems. One
comprises a matrix of extracellular polysaccharides, synthesized by gum
genes, that embed the bacteria in a matrix in the xylem, eventually leading
to blockage of xylem flow and host water-stress. The other system is for
bacterial adhesion to the gut and mouthparts of the insect vector, and is
specified by 26 genes encoding the so-called fimbral proteins that are
needed for bacterial adhesion and translocation across cell surfaces. The
consortium (1) also identified genes encoding other molecules involved in
cell adhesion that were previously associated only with human and animal
pathogens. This is further evidence that disease-causing bacteria of humans
and plants have common mechanisms of pathogenicity (4).
One of the barriers to breeding and engineering plant resistance to _X.
fastidiosa_ is a comparative lack of knowledge of its interplay with its
citrus hosts. Usually, host­ pathogen specificity is conferred by
interactions between avirulence factors encoded by the pathogen and host
resistance factors. Surprisingly, however, _X. fastidiosa_ lacks
recognizable avirulence genes and the secretion system that injects them
directly into host cells. The authors (1) suspect that the direct injection
of bacteria into host cells by the insect carrier bypasses avirulence gene
function, and that the host ranges of _X. fastidiosa_ are defined by other
molecules. Exploring this aspect of the bacterium's biology will provide
new perspectives on host­pathogen interactions, with the ultimate general
goal of developing tolerance and resistance in crop plants.
The impending completion of several other bacterial and fungal
plant-pathogen sequences, and the initiation of genome sequencing of
_Rhizobium meliloti_ (the nitrogen-fixing symbiont of legumes), adds
further to the exciting possibilities in agricultural genomics. Moreover,
the near-completion of the sequence of the favoured model plant
_Arabidopsis_ and the start of rice genome sequencing, along with
farm-animal genome projects that draw strongly on mouse and human genome
sequencing, are establishing a solid foundation for research. This is
research with eminently practical ends: tackling current or imminent
problems in food production, human nutrition and environmental degradation.
For example, disease-resistant crops, and plants better adapted to grow in
extreme conditions, are nearly ready for large-scale use.
This first implementation of large-scale sequencing in Brazil is only a
harbinger of things to come. The same consortium is now sequencing another
plant pathogen, _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pathovar _citri_. The bacterium
causes citrus canker, a worldwide disease that can severely damage citrus
crops. The citrus industry in Florida is currently under threat from the
canker bacterium which was spread by a tornado in 1996 (5).
The successful sequencing of _X. fastidiosa_ also shows that genome
projects are a highly effective tool for science policy. Such projects
provide a strong direction to and framework for biological investigations;
they direct disparate areas of biology towards common themes; and they
result in the distribution of the latest technologies to many laboratories,
allowing scientific talent to flourish more widely.

[The completion of the genome sequence of _X. fastidiosa_ represents an
important milestone in phytobacteriology. Two surprising discoveries
(carbohydrates are the sole energy source and the apparent lack of
avirulence genes) will undoubtedly spur additional research to better
understand the biology of the bacterium. Sequencing of the genome of _X.
axonopdis_ pathovar _citri_ will hopefully be done rapidly, leading to
development of DNA-based technologies for disease management. - Mod.DH
