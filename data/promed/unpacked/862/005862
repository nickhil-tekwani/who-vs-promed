FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Health secretary says preliminary tests show 3 human cases of West Nile
virus [infection in Pennsylvania
-----------------
Patients recovering -- Pennsylvanians reminded to take action to prevent
mosquito-breeding sites.
-----------------
Health Secretary Robert S. Zimmerman Jr. today reported that preliminary
test results show 3 Pennsylvania residents have contracted West Nile
encephalitis. The 3 individuals are a 60-year-old Philadelphia County man,
a 49-year-old Delaware County woman, and a 60-year-old Fayette County man.
All are recovering.
Final test results are expected next week, but preliminary test results
conducted by the Department of Health are 95% accurate.
If confirmed, these will be the first human cases of West Nile virus
[infection found in Pennsylvania since the disease was identified in the
United States in 1999.
Secretary Zimmerman said "These cases are not unexpected since we've known
for several months -- through bird and mosquito testing -- that West Nile
virus is present in Pennsylvania. We now are working to pinpoint exactly
where these people may have contracted the virus. In the meantime, we are
stepping up our surveillance efforts throughout Pennsylvania to determine
if there is an increased public health risk, and we are initiating further
control measures."
"Two of these individuals -- the Fayette County man and the Delaware County
woman -- had traveled outside of the state, and we can't conclude that they
contracted the virus here in Pennsylvania," Secretary Zimmerman said. "But
we want to err with an abundance of caution, and so we are taking steps to
reduce the number of adult mosquitoes in the Philadelphia area."
The Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the Philadelphia
County Health Department yesterday sprayed the marshy, wet areas near the
I-95 corridor in Southwest Philadelphia to reduce the number of adult
mosquitoes in the area.
DEP also is working with Delaware and Fayette counties to identify
mosquito-breeding areas and apply larvicide where appropriate. There are
fewer adult mosquito populations in Fayette County due to colder weather
there.
Since 1 Jan 2001, there have been 18 identified human cases of West Nile
virus [infection in 7 states -- Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Maryland,
New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania. This includes 2 deaths, one each in
Maryland and Georgia. The [Pennsylvania Health Department's Public Health
Laboratory this year has performed tests of 189 people with clinical
symptoms of encephalitis.
So far this year in Pennsylvania, West Nile virus has been found in 149
birds, 20 mosquito samples, and 2 horses.
In his 2001-02 budget, Gov. Ridge provided $11.1 million to prevent and
lessen the potential public-health effects of West Nile virus on
Pennsylvanians. The funds provide necessary staffing and an improved
epidemiological infrastructure to detect the virus in Pennsylvania.
