The first case of African swine fever (ASF) was established in the village of Tutrakantsi in the Varna region, the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency (BNSA) announced on Friday [31 Aug 2018], a day after it became clear that the disease had reached the country.

A couple of days ago [around 28 Aug 2018], 3 of 7 backyard fattening pigs died in Tutrakantsi. The mayor immediately reported the deaths to the local veterinary service, and samples were taken. The samples were investigated by the National Reference Laboratory and found to be positive for the presence of ASF virus.

The head of the Food Agency has ordered that measures be taken to eradicate the outbreak and limit the spread of the disease. A 3-km [1.9-mile] protection zone has been announced around the epicenter, including the villages Tutrakantsi and Bozveliysko in Provadia district, Varna region. A 10-km [6.2-mile] surveillance zone has been implemented around the outbreak point, which includes settlements in the municipalities of the Provadia district -- Avren, Dolni and Dulgopol -- in Varna region, with the consequent measures applied.
.
The region of Varna prohibits the trade, movement and transport of domestic swine except for those intended for immediate slaughter, liable to authorization by an official veterinarian for such transit. It is forbidden to hold markets and exhibitions of pigs. The owners of the culled animals will receive compensation.

ASF has entered Bulgaria, even though in August [2018] the authorities built 130 km [81 miles] of wire fence along the border with Romania to prevent the free passage of wild boars into the country. AFS is a highly contagious viral disease in domestic and wild swine. It is transmitted directly through contact between diseased and healthy animals and indirectly by contact with virus-contaminated materials and surfaces, by swallowing infected feeds, and mainly by feeding waste containing contaminated pork or meat products.

There is no cure and vaccine for the lethal virus, so the only solution to the problem is the killing of infected domestic and wild swine and avoiding contact with them, but this will seriously affect the industry for years. The disease is harmless to humans.

Romania submitted on 31 Aug 2018 a follow-up report citing 3 new ASF outbreaks in domestic pigs, within its southeastern province of Constanta, bordering Bulgaria. One of the 3 is adjacent to the border; the report, including an interactive map, is available at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=27740.

Currently, there are nearly 800 outbreaks spreading over 10 of Romania's counties. According to the National Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Authority (ANSVSA), more than 120 000 animals have been slaughtered to stop the spread of the disease. The Romanian president has recently addressed the issue; see details at

Some sources attributed the rapid spread of the virus, causing hundreds of outbreaks in backyard farms in the counties Tulcea (521 outbreaks) and Ialomita (93), to an alleged contamination of the Danube River by pigs' cadavers. In the past, suspicions of waterborne transmission of ASF, in other countries, could not be confirmed. In a 2008 FAO document [1], it was stated that "Waterborne transmission is most unlikely because of dilution of the virus." The issue was also briefly discussed by Greenfield et al. [2]. This issue needs a critical assessment. - Mod.AS
