[As you know, the media everywhere tend to simplify things, sometimes
distorting the facts. The facts in Sarawak:
1. Sampling of pigs in farms throughout the country for IgG [antibody to
Nipah virus is now routine. Most farms in Sarawak were negative in an
April bleed (15 pigs tested per farm). By the May bleed a cluster of farms
had IgG positive pigs - an example from one of these farms: from 0/15 pigs
positive in April to 8/15 positive in May. ELISA tests were done at the
Veterinary Research Institute in Ipoh using protocols jointly set up by
Malaysian and Australian veterinary scientists.
2. At the end of June when these results became available, all humans
working and living in these seroconverting farms were screened. Note that
they were screened for specific IgG antibodies and IgM antibodies using
reagents provided by the CDC Atlanta, with methods also provided by the
CDC. Two humans from one farm had IgM, no IgG. This was a farm which had
seroconverted in the previous month.
3. A set of "normal" sera obtained from the same risk group (people living
and working in the vicinity of pig farms) collected in 1999 when there was
no suspicion of transmission taking place in Sarawak, were also tested for
specific IgG and IgM. No reactive sera were found. Based on this normal
distribution, the four IgM positive sera in the context of seroconverting
farms, some with coughing pigs, a decision was made to take the threat of
Nipah virus transmission seriously in order to avert another outbreak.
4. Hence the serological results suggest the possibility of recent pig as
well as human exposure to Nipah virus or a virus like Nipah. I think that
the kind of disease we are talking about demands that we should not be
complacent about exposure. Nobody knows enough about protective mechanisms
in Nipah virus infection and it would be irresponsible of us not to follow
up IgM positive individuals. Second specimens will definitely be taken and
tested to confirm or negate the possibility of exposure by demonstrating
seroconversion in individuals (as opposed to the current result of
seroconversion on a population basis). In the meantime, the health
authorities would rather err on the side of caution (i.e. protecting human
health) than act only if there are human deaths.
5. Media releases were probably inappropriately phrased and uninformed
media coverage compounded the problem leading to totally garbled news reports.
In summary, nobody is saying that there is a Nipah virus outbreak in humans
here in Sarawak, merely that the health authorities are attempting to make
sure that there won't be one. The investigation underway at the moment is
not a clinical investigation but a public health investigation to determine
if there is/will be a problem, and measures are being taken to avert
another disaster.

[We are grateful for Jane's clarifications. As has been stated repeatedly,
there is no evidence of an epizootic of Nipah virus in Malaysia at this
time and there have been no confirmed human cases of this disease. Whether
these recent findings indicate the beginning of an epizootic will have to
await further studies. - Mod. CHC
