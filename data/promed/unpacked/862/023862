DENGUE - INDONESIA (EAST JAVA) (02): CORRECTION
===============================================

[see

The information posted as "Dengue - Indonesia (East Java)" is not correct.
"Muntaber" is an abbreviation for "muntah berak" and is usually used to
describe clinical cholera. Dengue is known in Indonesian as "demam
berdarah". I have no specific information about the Madura island outbreak.

Government of Indonesia has called in additional physicians "to anticipate
possible fast spread". -- Mod CHC]
