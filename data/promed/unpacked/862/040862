Swine Fever Hits the Balkans
-----------------------------
In the Balkans steps are being taken to prevent the further spread of swine
fever amongst pig production facilities.
So far, Bulgaria has made the strongest response to the outbreak, with
authorities there banning pig exports and trade in pigs in the local
livestock markets to contain the outbreaks. Swine fever has been identified
in 2 of the Balkan country's 28 regions.
Although the disease is harmless for humans, it can spread rapidly through
a pig population, killing off piglets and wreaking havoc to production.
Veterinary officials believe that the current outbreak is attributable to
the lax implementation of compulsory vaccinations for swine farms. To
prevent further outbreaks, the officials have implemented restrictions on
the movement of all swine from farms. Currently only vaccinated animals can
be sent to slaughter houses. A number of animals have already been
slaughtered, although officials have not confirmed any numbers.
In recent years there have been several outbreaks of swine fever in
Bulgaria, all of which were successfully contained. The most recent
occurred at the start of last year, when 12 regions were affected due to
illegal swine trade and ineffective implementation of vaccinations.

[Bulgaria reported to the OIE 9 outbreaks of classical swine fever between
27 Nov 2002 and 28 Feb 2003, all in unvaccinated pigs in private pig farms
(see Information received on 20 and 25 Feb 2003 from Dr Nikola T. Belev,
Delegate of Bulgaria to the OIE:
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_30.HTM#Sec2> ).
Reportedly, the origin of infection was feeding with non-sterilized fats
and congenital infection, while the mode of spread was contact with
non-immune animals. The report mentioned the following control measures:
control of wildlife reservoirs; quarantine and movement control inside the
country; modified stamping out; surveillance and monitoring.
The definition of "stamping out policy" in OIE's International Animal
Health Code is: "the killing of the animals which are affected and those
suspected of being affected in the herd and, where appropriate, those in
other herds which have been exposed to infection by direct animal-to-animal
contact, or by indirect contact of a kind likely to cause the transmission
of the causal pathogen. All susceptible animals, vaccinated or
unvaccinated, on an infected premises should be killed and their carcasses
destroyed by burning or burial, or by any other method which will eliminate
the spread of infection through the carcasses or products of the animals
killed. This policy should be accompanied by the cleansing and disinfection
procedures defined in the Code".
The term "modified stamping-out policy" is used in communications to the
OIE whenever the above animal health measures are not implemented in full.
Examples: killing of unvaccinated animals only and slaughtering some of the
contact/exposed animals for human consumption. - Mod.AS]
