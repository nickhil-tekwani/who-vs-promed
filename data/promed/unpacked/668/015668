[As there has been increased surveillance for, and reporting of isolation
of, low pathogenicity avian influenza virus in wild birds in the United
States (and probably in other countries), this post will start a new thread
"Avian influenza, LP, wild avians - USA". - Mod.DK]
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Department of the Interior
(DOI) today announced a detection of H5 and N1 avian influenza subtypes in
a wild Green-winged teal sample from Tuscola County, Mich., that was killed
by hunters. Initial tests confirm that this wild bird sample does not
contain the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain that has spread through birds in
Asia, Europe and Africa.
However, initial test results do indicate the presence of low pathogenic
avian influenza (LPAI) virus, which poses no threat to human health.
On 15 Oct 2006, 51 bird samples were collected through a partnership
between USDA and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources as part of an
expanded wild bird monitoring program. USDA and DOI are working
collaboratively with states to sample wild birds throughout the United
States for the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). As a
result of this expanded testing program, USDA and DOI expect to identify
additional cases of common strains of avian influenza in birds, which is
not cause for concern.
Of the 51 samples collected from a number of wild bird species, 5 were sent
to USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa,
for confirmatory testing. One sample tested positive for both H5 and N1
subtypes. This does not mean these birds are infected with an H5N1 strain.
It is possible that there could be 2 separate avian influenza viruses, one
containing H5 and the other containing N1. Confirmatory testing underway at
NVSL will clarify whether one or more strains of the virus are present, the
specific subtype, as well as confirm the pathogenicity. These results are
expected within 2 to 3 weeks and will be made public when completed.
Low pathogenic avian influenza commonly occurs in wild birds. It typically
causes only minor sickness or no noticeable signs in birds. These strains
of the virus include LPAI H5N1, commonly referred to as "North American"
H5N1, which is very different from the more severe HPAI H5N1 circulating
overseas.
There is no known health risk to hunters or hunting dogs from contact with
low-pathogenic forms of avian influenza virus. Nevertheless, hunters are
always encouraged to use common-sense sanitation practices, such as hand
washing and thorough cooking, when handling or preparing wildlife of any
kind. DOI has issued guidelines for safe handling and preparation of wild game.
