Bananas in the country are facing a real threat from what is called the 'banana wilt associated phytoplasma' disease. Acting Chief plant protection officer, David Tenakanai, said the local staple is facing a real threat. "We have noticed the problem in Sandaun Province, but it has now spread to Madang, towards Lae and we found patches of it in Milne Bay and Western Province.

Similar to the Bogia coconut syndrome currently in Madang Province, it is spread by insects, via banana suckers and coconut seedlings. "The concern we have now, is that this occurs when people are moving the suckers around," Mr Tenakanai said. Visible symptoms can be identified.

"We are looking at yellowing of the banana leaves and fruit bunches that do not develop into bananas. Dropping of the leaves leads to the entire plant dying. When people see this they must not move the banana suckers."

[Bogia coconut syndrome (BCS) is associated with a phytoplasma of the palm lethal yellowing (LY) taxonomic group (16SrIV; for more information see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). BCS is reported to spread rapidly in PNG and to have caused losses of over 5000 trees. It is considered a threat to regional coconut production, the economically important national oil palm industry, as well as a valuable coconut germplasm collection located near Madang (ProMED-mail post 20130614.1770603).

A possible causal relationship between presence of phytoplasmas and unusual wilt symptoms in cooking banana plants was reported from PNG in 2011 (ProMED-mail post 20110223.0592). Sequence analysis showed that phytoplasmas from diseased plants in 4 provinces were unique, but most closely related to the BCS phytoplasma. Since then, a banana wilt due to the same or a closely related phytoplasma or strain was also reported from Solomon Islands (see links below). Recently, the new taxon _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma noviguineense has been suggested, to include the BCS phytoplasma as well as the closely related pathogens associated with banana wilt and arecanut yellow leaf diseases in the region.

Our grateful thanks are due to Dr R Davis, Australian Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, for providing the following additional information and background:
Discussions are still ongoing as to the exact relationship between the different phytoplasmas. Some very significant pathological differences between areas have been observed. For example, banana plants and coconut palms are both dying in Madang Province but elsewhere only the bananas are affected. Preliminary phylogenetic trees clearly separate the coconut and banana phytoplasmas of Madang Province from banana phytoplasmas of Western Province in PNG and from those in the Solomon Islands archipelago.
There is concern that diagnostic techniques used for current surveys may not be suitable or sensitive enough to detect minor differences in pathogen sequences and so to distinguish between strains/species. It has been shown previously that changes in single or very few nucleotides may affect pathogenicity and host range of viruses and viroids (e.g. coconut cadang-cadang viroid), and this is likely to be the case also for phytoplasmas and other pathogens.
Very little is known so far about epidemiology of the new phytoplasmas. Several insect vectors have been identified, but it remains to be clarified whether they can selectively spread certain strains.
