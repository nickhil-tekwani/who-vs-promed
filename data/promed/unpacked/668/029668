UK: Mad cow case confirmed in Scotland
-------------------------------------
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)
has confirmed that a 6-year-old cow born into a herd in central
Scotland has contracted BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy).
The cow's herd was accepted into the Beef Assurance Scheme (BAS) in
January 1997, a plan implementing stringent safeguards meant to
ensure cattle have less risk of contracting BSE than other herds. The
scheme also allows meat from cattle up to 42 months to be sold for
human consumption, rather than the 30 months threshold for all other
cattle.
DEFRA has notified the UK Foods Standards Agency (FSA) of the
case, and yesterday the FSA Scotland stressed that the cow had not
entered the food chain, because it was sold to a non-BAS herd in
November 1998 and therefore it poses no threat to food safety.
Dr George Paterson, Director of the FSA Scotland, told Food
Navigator: "We have requested assurances that all BAS herds comply
fully with the requirements of the scheme. We want to be satisfied that
controls are working, as well as get answers as to what happened in
this case."
