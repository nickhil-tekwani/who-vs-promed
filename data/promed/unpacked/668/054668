[Although bluetongue virus (BTV) is circulating widely throughout the African continent and considered endemic on some of the islands of the Indian Ocean region, no information was available for Mayotte, one of the islands of the Comoros archipelago administrated by France and part of the European Union, until recently. Following the application of a cross-sectional study during 2016, it has been shown, for the 1st time, that BTV and another orbivirus, epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV), were circulating in Mayotte, with widespread distribution of the viruses throughout the island. At least 5 BTV serotypes (4, 9, 11, 15 and 19) and one EHDV serotype (6) were detected from asymptomatic cattle (Ref 1).

Most of the cattle acquired antibodies in their 1st years of age. Coinfection with BTV and EHDV was observed in 9.4% of samples.

It will be helpful to note if clinical signs have been reported in the 2 cattle covered in the above OIE report, which adds BTV-10 to the 5 serotypes identified earlier.

The _Culicoides_-borne bluetongue virus (BTV) is generally known to cause a severe clinical disease and mortality in susceptible sheep breeds, while cattle, though readily infected, remain subclinical in the majority of cases.
