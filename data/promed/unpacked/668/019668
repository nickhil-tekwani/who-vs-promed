[The previous ProMED-mail post (Hantavirus - Americas (65): Argentina (CH) fatal, susp 20181205.6178716) reported 5 suspected cases of hantavirus infections. The above report indicated that these 5 suspected cases are now confirmed, but the specific hantavirus involved is not mentioned. Now, there are 3 new suspected cases.

Epuyen is located in the Andes mountains, and the virus most likely involved is Andes hantavirus, which is endemic in the southern Andes. This is the beginning of the summer season, when cases of hantavirus infection occur. The patients likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus in the region.

Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person to person and only through close physical contact, usually within the family. The most common source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the Sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY
