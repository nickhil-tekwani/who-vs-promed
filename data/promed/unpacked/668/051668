Barely a month and a half after the invasion of the so-called "murder hornets," the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) has identified specimens of the invasive and disease-carrying Asian tiger mosquito (_Aedes albopictus_) in Wayne County, the state's most populous county.

The mosquito, which is identifiable by its trademark white bands on its legs and body, was first found in the state back in 2017, according to local news station WNEM.

Scientists say the warming climate helped the mosquitoes infest northern regions, whereas they had previously existed in southern and northeastern states. The mosquitoes are believed to have been imported into the state via commercial shipments from other states.

The mosquitoes can spread dengue, chikungunya and Zika, viruses that can cause fever, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, and rashes. Dengue can also cause bleeding and low blood pressure.

"Although we have not had any illnesses associated with these species of mosquitoes in Michigan, it is important to take precautions since other mosquitoes can spread viruses such as West Nile and eastern equine encephalitis to people," said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the chief medical executive of the MDHHS.

The MDHHS has recommended that residents wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and socks and use an EPA-registered insect repellent when outdoors. Additionally, the department suggests installing screens on windows and doors as well as getting rid of any containers holding standing water. Adults lay their eggs in stagnant water, and the larvae eventually develop into biting adults.

[_Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes were found for the 1st time in 2017 and again 2 years ago in Wayne County, Michigan, so it is not surprising to find it again there (see Invasive mosquito - USA (03): (MI) 20180903.6005327). The above report indicates that it was probably reintroduced into the country and is not established there. There is no indication in the above report of how abundant the mosquito is, but presumably only a few individuals were found. Ongoing transmission of Zika, chikungunya, or dengue viruses in Michigan is unlikely. That would require abundant _A. albopictus_ populations and introduction of the virus via a viremic individual who traveled into the state.

The main risk that this mosquito presents is less for transmission of Zika and other viruses than for transmission of La Crosse and Jamestown Canyon viruses, to which it is susceptible. It has been shown in the laboratory that this mosquito species is susceptible to infection by both of these orthobunyaviruses. Dual infections by both of these viruses can result in reassortment of the 3 RNA strands, with all 6 reassortants produced. These 2 viruses can co-circulate in the same woodlands in places like the Upper Midwest of the USA. Should _A. albopictus_ become established in ecosystems where these 2 viruses are endemic, the emergence of new, reassorted viruses is possible.

_A. albopictus_ is gradually moving northward. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention's map of geographic areas suitable for this mosquito includes Michigan (http://www.cdc.gov/zika/vector/range.html). This mosquito can enter diapause and survive winter conditions. It may be that this mosquito is becoming established in the Upper Midwestern states. - Mod.TY
