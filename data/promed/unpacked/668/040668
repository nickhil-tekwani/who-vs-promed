A total of 4912 people in the Altai Krai [territory] have been bitten
by ticks so far this year [2010]. A total of 21 individuals received
hospital treatment on suspicion of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus
infection. In addition 238 suspected cases of tick-borne rickettsiosis
were registered in the Altai Krai.

A survey of ticks revealed that 24 of 319 ticks examined were
tick-borne encephalitis virus vectors. 58 [of 60] rayons [regions] of
the Oblast are endemic for tick-borne encephalitis.

As of 1 Jun 2010, 1834 people, including 563 children in the Omsk
Oblast have sought treatment for tick bites. Of these, 30 suspected
cases of tick-borne encephalitis virus infection, including 11
children, were hospitalized. However, none has been confirmed so far
by laboratory diagnosis. A total of 216 of the tick bites occurred
within the boundaries of the city of Omsk.

The Omsk Oblast authorities allocated 9 million rubles [about USD 300
000] for purchase of 64 000 doses of TBE vaccine for administration to
children. So far 31 292 individuals have received a full course of
vaccine.

[Several rickettsioses are reported in the Russian Federation:

- Registered morbidity of typhus in Russia varies from 0 to 0.01 per
1000 for the last decade.
- Siberian tick typhus, caused by _R. sibirica_, is registered on a
large territory from Pacific coasts to Western Siberia, and its
incidence continuously increases, varying between 2500 and 4000
officially reported cases per year.
- Astrakhan spotted fever, caused by _R. conorii_ subsp. _caspia_ has
been recognized since 1983.
- Far Eastern tick-borne rickettsiosis, caused by _R.
heilongjiangensis_, has also been described.

Several other spotted fever group rickettsiae have been detected and
isolated from ticks in Russia; however, they have not yet been linked
with clinical cases in these regions.

[Siberian tick typhus is a rickettsiosis, presumably due to
_Rickettsia sibirica_. For a discussion of the tick-borne rickettsial
diseases in Russia, see Dr. Steve Berger's comments in ProMED archive
number 20040514.1301.

Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), also known as Central European
encephalitis or Russian spring-summer encephalitis, is an endemic
disease in rural regions of Russia. Although vaccine preventable, no
TBE vaccines are licensed or available in the United States. There
are 2 equivalent, safe, and effective inactivated TBE vaccines
available in Europe, in adult and pediatric formulations (see
<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/ch4/tickborne.aspx>).

The following on TBE is extracted from comments in ProMED archive
number 20081007.3175:

According to the World Health Organisation
<http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/tick_encephalitis/en/>
the endemic area for tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) spreads from
Alsace-Lorraine [France] in the west to Vladivostok and northeastern
regions of China in the east, and from Scandinavia to Italy, Greece,
and Crimea in the south. TBE also is endemic in North Japan, where the
virus has repeatedly been isolated from blood samples of sentinel
dogs, ticks, and rodent spleens. TBE is a serious acute central
nervous system infection, which may result in death or long-term
neurological sequelae in 35-58 percent of patients. The fatality rate
associated with clinical infection is 0.5-20 percent. The proportion
of cases involving subclinical infection varies between 70 percent and
98 percent. Symptomatic infection occurs in all age groups.

The agent is the TBE virus (TBEV), a flavivirus that is transmitted
to humans by the bite of a tick. A total of 8 species of ticks have
been identified that can transmit TBEV. The chief vectors are _Ixodes
ricinus_ in Europe and the western part of the Russian Federation,
and _Ixodes persulcatus_ in the eastern part of the Russian Federation.

Biysk is the 2nd largest city in Altai Krai, which is situated in
southwestern Siberia Federal District. Altai Krai can be found on a map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altai_Krai>. The Siberian Federal
District, one of the 7 federal districts of Russia, is the central of
the 3 Asian districts, and can be located on a map at

[The natural hosts of TBE virus are small rodents and insectivores.
Livestock are also infected and excrete the virus in their milk,
causing infection in people who drink raw (unpasteurised) milk. The
natural hosts of tick-borne rickettsiae are the ticks themselves,
which pass the microbes through their various developmental stages to
the egg and thus to following generations. Human and animal
infections are a tangential result of the tick's blood-feeding habit.
