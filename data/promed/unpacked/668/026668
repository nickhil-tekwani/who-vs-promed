An initial release of the RHDV1 (K5) rabbit virus on 3 sites in Southland will be made from next week [2-7 April 2018], if the weather permits.

Environment Southland senior biosecurity officer Dave Burgess said rabbits were less of an issue in Southland than in other areas of New Zealand, which was why a smaller scale release was planned, but further releases could be made later.

K5 is a virus that could reduce the rabbit population significantly. It is a variant of a virus already present in New Zealand, and only affects the European rabbit. Using the virus was approved in late February [2018]. Mr. Burgess said the virus needed to be released before the weather turned colder, so now was the optimal time. "While it spreads naturally between rabbits, it does rely on flies to spread it further and fly numbers decrease as the weather cools."

Landowners were asked not to move any rabbit carcasses so the virus could spread naturally. Moving carcasses could dilute the strength of the virus and result in rabbits becoming immune to it.

Mr. Burgess said the virus release was another tool to assist with control, but it would not eliminate the need for landowners to have a control plan in place. Rabbit control remained a landowner responsibility and Environment Southland's biosecurity team provided advice and support to landowners to ensure rabbit control was carried out effectively.

Rabbit owners were reminded to ensure their pets' vaccinations were up to date.

The virus has been released at 100 sites across Otago.

[In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay and Reunion Island.

RHDV is a highly virulent lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90 percent), and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival or oral routes. K5 is a Korean strain already released in Australia and New Zealand.

For these characteristics of RHDV, it was deliberately released in Australia and New Zealand. There, RHD has reduced rabbit abundance, particularly in dry regions, but rabbits in cooler, high-rainfall areas have been able to maintain their populations. In Australia and New Zealand, RHD has raised the prospects for managing rabbits in low rainfall areas and brought substantial economic and environmental benefits. It is expected that after many generations the defense strategies rabbits evolve to resist and/or tolerate RHDV, so introduction of a novel strain might enable boosting the efficiency of RHD as a biological control. - Mod.PMB
