There are 4 suspected cases of botulism in Amarillo, Texas. On Fri 6 Dec 2013, the Health Department was informed of the 1st potential case in Amarillo. They soon began investigating and discovered 3 other possible cases. Two of the patients matched the criteria and were given botulinum antitoxin. Doctors say they are slowly improving. All 4 patients are adults and are currently hospitalized.

"We've got a small group of people who know each other in some manner; we hope that there are no other cases, but we just want to do our due diligence and make sure that we are protecting our community by providing information," said Casie Stoughton, the Assistant Director of the City of Amarillo Public Health Department.

While one patient remains on a ventilator, another is now breathing on their own after receiving similar treatment. Another patient had symptoms, began feeling better, and then traveled to Georgia before having symptoms again and is currently hospitalized there. The last patient is getting better on their own because officials say they caught it sooner than the others. While all 4 of the patients know one another, the source of the illness has not been determined.

"There's a lot we don't know; we haven't found common sources; we haven't found any common restaurants. ... There are just a lot of pieces of the puzzle that we don't have," Stoughton said.

The CDC is sending experts to help the City of Amarillo investigate whether these patients do have botulism, and, if so, to determine the cause. Since botulism is often a foodborne illness, the investigation will center around what the patients ate in the hours and days leading up to their illnesses.

Common symptoms include blurry vision, difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, and heavy or droopy eye lids. Because the bacterial toxin attacks the body's nerve endings, it can lead to paralysis. Symptoms usually appear 12 to 36 hours after being exposed to the toxin, but it may take up to 8 days. Doctors say it can take up to 6 months for a patient to be fully healthy again. If left untreated, it can be fatal. The disease cannot be passed person to person.

[Although botulism can be confused with a variety of neurological illnesses, when a cluster of similar illnesses occur, there are few other entities other botulism that would cause them. Although usually connected with tainted food, often due to inadequately prepared home canned foods, wound botulism clusters may occur from contaminated black tar heroin or from uncontrolled "Botox" use.

Most USA ProMED botulism postings relate to an alert that a particular commercially prepared food was not adequately made, which would increase a risk of intoxication with _C. botulinum_ toxin, and in most of these instances, no clear evidence of botulism is found in the food product. When botulism does occur related to food, it is most likely to be home-prepared. It should be noted that in typical food-borne botulism, the toxin is preformed in the food when ingested rather than disease being produced with ingestion of spores. Infant botulism (and its very rare adult equivalent, adult intestinal toxemia botulism) are caused by ingestion of spores, which germinate, and toxin is formed _in situ_.

Botulinum, the most toxic of known toxins, is produced by the gram-positive spore forming anaerobic bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, found in soil worldwide. Botulism is caused by the consumption of contaminated products containing spores. Spores produce toxin when they germinate in the product or in the digestive tract. Humans are most often intoxicated by consumption of the preformed toxin in such things as home-canned vegetables or even baked potatoes left un-refrigerated. As little as 0.001 microgram per kilogram of body weight may be lethal. The time from ingestion of the toxin until clinical signs are observed will vary with the amount of toxin ingested. The onset of clinical signs may be as short as a few hours but is seldom more than 24 hours. A very small amount of material containing the toxin can cause symptoms. Signs can develop rapidly, and death can occur in as little as 6 hours after initial onset. Clinical signs may begin in human beings between 12-36 hours after ingestion of the toxin. The clinical signs and symptoms in human beings include ptosis [drooping eyelid], blurred vision, diplopia [double vision], dry mouth and throat, dysphagia [difficulty swallowing], and dysphoria [feeling unwell or unhappy]. These are a result of cranial nerve palsies. These early signs are followed by symmetrical descending flaccid paralysis, with generalized weakness and progression to respiratory failure. - Mod.LL
