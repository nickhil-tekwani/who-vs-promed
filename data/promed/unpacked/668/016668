SHIGELLA CONNEY - CANADA (MONTREAL)
===================================
Date: Mon, 12 May 1997 00:54:29 +0100
From: pbigras@netrover.com (Pierre Bigras)

Media report - The French language Montreal daily LA PRESSE reported Sunday
[11 May 1997] that an outbreak of shighellosis caused by the Shigella
conney bacteria has affected 21 persons in the last ten days. Of the 21
persons infected, four have been hospitalized.

The outbreak appears to be centered around a
vegetarian restaurant chain with nine outlets, with seven in Montreal all
of which are supplied from a central kitchen. Although there is so far no
positive evidence of the presence of the bacteria in the food served in
those restaurants, the management of the restaurant chain, after
consultation with the local and provincial health authorities, has decided
to temporarily shut down its operations. According to its VP Marketing the
decision to stop operations is preventive in nature, all premises will
be disinfected, all employees tested and all food called back because "we
do not want to take any chances in light of our (company) mission which is
the promotion of health".
Dr. Richard Masse from the Public Health Services for Montreal (DSP
Montreal centre) stated that the usual number of shigellosis cases in
Montreal was from 5 to 10 per month, but all of them involve people
returning from travel abroad, which is not the case with the present
outbreak.
