As rabies sweeps across dog populations in China's southwest Yunnan province almost 5000 canines have been culled in an anti-rabies campaign.

With 5 human deaths in the past 3 months, the municipal government in Baoshan City is carrying out a campaign to stop the threat, with more than 4900 dogs killed and 100 000 vaccinated.

The human casualties, one in July and 4 in August [2014], were reported in 4 townships and villages in Shidian County. Longling County and Longyang District have also reported dog bites.

As reminded by R. Rupprecht (ProMED-mail archive no 20130926.1969894) "Mass dog vaccination, not culling, is the safe, humane, and cost-effective method for the elimination of canine rabies on a global level."

It is encouraging to note that, at least in China's Yunnan province, dog vaccination policy has been applied: with most owned dogs vaccinated, culling becoming exceptional, probably applied when other means are not feasible in order to protect human lives.
