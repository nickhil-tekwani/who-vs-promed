Abstract
--------
An immunocompetent 45-year-old Cuban-American man [with no known past medical history, no alcohol consumption, and remote history of travel to Spain] presented with worsening knee pain and swelling despite antibiotic therapy. On physical examination, the patient was ill-appearing, cachectic, with a protuberant abdomen and massive splenomegaly. In addition, he had a 10 cm [about 4 in] area of peripheral hyperemia with central necrosis in the medial left knee that was non-tender and non-fluctuant. Initial lab work demonstrated pancytopenia, hyponatremia, hypoalbuminemia, and anemia of chronic inflammation. Peripheral smear showed microcytic, hypochromic red blood cells with mild anisopoikilocytosis. and leukopenia with slight left shift and metamyelocytes. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated amastigotes and kinetoplasts within white blood cells and extracellular space consistent with leishmaniasis. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) testing with PCR returned positive for _Leishmania infantum_. The patient received 2 courses of amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) with a 28-day course of miltefosine, which resulted in clinical improvement. This case illustrates the unique pathology that can affect immigrants and highlights the need to increase health provider awareness of foreign pathologies in areas with large migrant populations.

[The person was probably exposed to leishmaniasis in Spain. It is well known that immunocompetent persons can be infected with leishmania for years without showing any symptoms.

The report does not discuss autochthonous transmission in the USA (see ProMED archive 20180726.5929488).

Genotyping was not done and we are therefore not able to link the _Leishmania_ to either Spain or a focus in the USA.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in the same patient is very unusual but seen in immunocompromised patients (Al Balushi A, Khamis F, Klaassen CHW, et al. Double infection with _Leishmania tropica_ and _L. major_ in an HIV patient controlled with high doses of amphotericin B. Open Forum Infect Dis. 2018; 5(12): ofy323; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30619911/).

Unfortunately, the _Leishmania_ from this patient was not genotyped. The case illustrates the difficulties with a rare diagnosis. - Mod.EP
