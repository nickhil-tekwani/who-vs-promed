The following data on human cryptosporidiosis in the U.K. were extracted
from the GIDEON software program:
7,768 cases were reported by England and Wales in 1989, with large outbreaks
in Swindon, Oxford and North Humberside. 5,163 cases were reported in 1991;
4,432 in 1994; 5,691 in 1995 (38.5% under age 5 years); 3,662 in 1996 -
highest rates (16/100,000) in Northern Region; 4,321 in 1997.
23 outbreaks (involving 1,066 cases) were reported during 1992 to 1994;
three waterborne outbreaks in 1994 (one involving 229 cases in southern
England). 575 cases were reported during an outbreak in Devon, 1995.
In 1997, contamination of treated borehole water in North Thames affected
300,000 households - 346 cases (244 primary, 59 secondary) were confirmed.
The latter was one of 7 water-borne outbreaks reported for England and Wales
during the first half of 1997.
Disease in Scotland peaks during March-April. An outbreak of 27 cases was
recorded in Ayrshire in 1988. 600 to 900 cases were reported yearly in
Scotland during 1990 to 1997.
