Serotypes other than _Salmonella_ Typhimurium, for example, the
outbreak caused by _S._ Livingstone in 1997, are mentioned in
ProMED-mail's post dated 18 Mar 2007, Salmonellosis, serotype
Typhimurium, sausage - Europe (02): background 20070318.0953]
To give some additional information on recent European outbreaks
caused by _S._ Livingstone there was one affecting Norway and Sweden
in February 2001, caused by contaminated fish products.
Countries not belonging to the Scandinavian Peninsula were not
affected. The main reason for highlighting _S._ Livingstone is that
relatively few outbreaks have been documented thoroughly where this
serotype has been implicated.
