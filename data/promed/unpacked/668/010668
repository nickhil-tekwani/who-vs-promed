Unusual mortality in brown pelicans in San Diego, California
-----------------------------------------------
California brown pelicans (_Pelicanus occidentalis_) have been found
debilitated and thin in multiple sites in San Diego County. In the
past 3 weeks [end of June 2004, beginning of July 2004], over 50
juvenile brown pelicans have been brought to SeaWorld, San Diego for
rehabilitation.
The number of birds coming into rehabilitation is 5 times the
expected number for pelicans at this time of year. The birds are
emaciated and weak. Although some respond to supportive care, many do
not, and, therefore, die soon after being admitted to the
rehabilitation facility.
Necropsy examination demonstrates overall emaciation and anemia.
Birds have typical levels of parasitic organisms. One bird (of 20)
has had incidental histologic changes suggestive of an adenoviral
infection. Most birds do not demonstrate signs of trauma or wounds.
We are looking into the possibility of an algal toxin or viral
disease. Samples have been sent to the state diagnostic laboratory
for West Nile virus testing.
Botulism is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for brown
pelicans at the nearby Salton Sea, but it is not, typically, a
concern for the coastal population. Poisoning with domoic acid (a
toxin produced by the red tide dinoflagellate (_Pseudonitzshia
australis_ ) is a concern for coastal pelicans, and samples have been
collected for screening for both botulinum toxin and domoic acid
detection.
Serum samples are being collected from live birds for serology. Multiple
tests are pending at this time.
The current working diagnosis is starvation. Discussions with a local
bait supplier suggest that anchovies and sardines (important elements
in the diet of this species) may be farther off the coast than usual,
and, less available to the birds.
