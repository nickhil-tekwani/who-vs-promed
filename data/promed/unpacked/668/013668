Abdominal typhus [typhoid fever] outbreak in Batkenskaya region (Kyrgyzstan)
-----------------------------------------------
According to Ministry of Health, there has been an outbreak of abdominal
typhus [typhoid fever] in the Batken region of Kyrgyzstan. By 5 Jul 2004,
since the beginning of the outbreak, which started in 25 May 2004, 144
people were hospitalized altogether. 59 of them have been confirmed with
laboratory testing.
To this point, almost everyday, new cases of the infection are being
reported, though the intensity of patient admission is less. Most of the
patients admitted were from Kizilbel village (70 people in total, 46 of
them with confirmed diagnosis) and from Batken City (16 total, 12 confirmed
cases).
More than 500 people have been treated with bacteriophage for preventive
purposes. All the patients are getting free medical care, and disinfective
measures are being taken. The cause of the outbreak is a lack of potable water.

[Most studies regarding treatment, and/or prevention, of bacterial
infections using specific bacteriophage therapy have not been controlled
studies. Although a role may exist in the circumstance of polydrug
resistance, it has yet to be well-defined.
The information below, regarding bacteriophage therapy is abstracted from
<http://www.intralytix.com/history.htm> (a biotech company that has been
researching uses of bacteriophages):
The first report about what is now known as a bacteriophage was published
more than a century ago. In 1896, Hankin reported that something in the
waters of the Ganges and Jumna rivers in India had marked antibacterial
action and could pass through a very fine porcelain filter. However, it was
another 20 years before a British bacteriologist, Frederick Twort, actually
isolated filterable entities capable of destroying bacterial cultures and
producing small cleared areas on bacterial lawns (1915).
2 years later, Felix d'Herelle, a French Canadian microbiologist working at
the Pasteur Institute in Paris, reported the same phenomenon. D'Herelle
called the virus bacteriophage or bacteria-eater (from the Greek phago
meaning to eat).
D'Herelle promoted the use of phages as therapeutic agents for the
treatment of infectious diseases. The first reported application of phages
to treat infectious diseases of humans came from Bruynoghe and Maisin in
France in 1921, who used bacteriophages to treat staphylococcal skin
disease. Phages have been used, since that time, for prophylaxis and
therapy in the United States (early 1930s) and, for the last 50 decades, in
eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union.
The international literature contains several hundred reports on phage
therapy, with the majority of the publications coming from researchers in
the former Soviet Union and eastern European countries.In the English
language, the most detailed descriptions have come from the Institute of
Immunology and Experimental Medicine of the Polish Academy of Sciences.
Phages were administered orally, applied directly to wounds, or given in
eye drops to more than 550 patients. Reported success rates ranged from 75
to 100 percent, depending on the pathogen. Some investigators reported the
successful treatment of experimental _E. coli_ infections in mice using
phages, and even suggested thepossible superiority of phages over
antibiotics. The ability of _Salmonella_ and _E. coli_ phages to reduce
colonization in/prevent death of experimentally-infected chickens also has
been reported.
During the long history of using phages as therapeutic agents throughout
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union (and, before the antibiotic era,
in the USA), there have been virtually no reports of serious complications
associated with their use. Phages are extremely common in the environment,
are regularly consumed in foods, and have been shown to be unintended
contaminants in a variety of medications, including vaccines commercially
available in the United States.
In this era of increasing antimicrobial resistance, such potential
therapeutic options are, not inappropriately, being increasingly explored.
