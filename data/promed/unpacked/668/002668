Samples from wastewater taken from 83 cities in the United States suggests that the latest surge of COVID-19 cases caused by the omicron variant may have already peaked in major urban areas but is still rising in rural communities. New York, Boston, Denver, the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, and San Diego have all likely peaked, according to virus detected in sewage samples. In the Twin Cities, Minnesota Public Radio reports that omicron cases likely peaked on 10 Jan 2022 and have been declining since that date based on sewage samples.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS), "SARS-CoV-2 can be shed in the feces of individuals with symptomatic or asymptomatic infection; therefore, wastewater surveillance can capture data on both types of infection."

In Illinois, Chicago health officials say omicron cases have likely peaked in their city. According to the Associated Press, test positivity peaked at nearly 20% on 1 Jan 2022, and is about 13% this week. Daily cases have dropped to 3000 per day, down from 8500 on 4 Jan 2022 (https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-travel-lifestyle-health-business-dedcc28bfdbac15be2efba9ce0adbe75).

The United States reported 979 920 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [19 Jan 2022] and 3810 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. The totals for the nation stand at 69 062 304 cases, including 859 503 deaths.

Americans perceive pandemic worsening
-------------------------------------
More Americans are worried about the pandemic now than in the fall of 2021, according to a new Gallup poll conducted from 4-11 Jan 2022: 72% of Americans reported wearing a mask outside the home that week, and 56% said they were avoiding large crowds. Less than 20% of participants said they had dined in a restaurant in the previous 24 hours. Attitudes toward vaccination remain stagnant, according to the Gallup poll. The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows that 63.1% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 75.2% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 39% of vaccinated Americans have received a booster dose (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total).

[More on wastewater detection: "Omicron was probably present in New York City's wastewater more than a week before the first case of the new variant was detected in the United States, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and researchers across the country (see http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7103a5).

"The samples suggest that someone in New York City may have had the omicron variant as early as 21 Nov 2021, 4 days before South African scientists first announced cases of the variant and 10 days before the first US case was reported. Researchers in California and Texas also found evidence of omicron in wastewater samples from late November 2021.

"The findings suggest that at the time, the omicron variant was more widespread in the United States than the case data alone would indicate, and provide more evidence that wastewater surveillance can serve as an early warning system about the spread of new variants" (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/20/health/nyc-omicron-wasteweater.html). - Mod.LK]

-------------------------------------------------------
COVID encephalopathy and/or the persistent cognitive impairment in COVID survivors is well documented and becoming a serious public health concern. We speculate that the beta-amyloid deposits described here may play a role in the pathophysiology of that syndrome. If that is true, COVID encephalopathy may respond to treatment with anti-amyloid therapeutics.

--------------------------------------------------------
Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is considered a respiratory pathogen, myriad neurologic complications -- including confusion, stroke, and neuromuscular disorders -- manifest during acute COVID-19. Furthermore, maladies such as impaired concentration, headache, sensory disturbances, depression, and even psychosis may persist for months after infection, as part of a constellation of symptoms now called long COVID. Even young people with mild initial disease can develop acute COVID-19 and long COVID neuropsychiatric syndromes. The pathophysiological mechanisms are not well understood, although evidence primarily implicates immune dysfunction, including nonspecific neuroinflammation and antineural autoimmune dysregulation. It is uncertain whether unforeseen neurological consequences may develop years after initial infection. With millions of individuals affected, nervous system complications pose public health challenges for rehabilitation and recovery and for disruptions in the workforce due to loss of functional capacity. There is an urgent need to understand the pathophysiology of these disorders and develop disease-modifying therapies.

Many people who experience neurologic symptoms that linger after acute COVID-19 are less than 50 years old and were healthy and active prior to infection.

--------------------------------------------------------
In a systematic review and meta-analysis, Misra and colleagues detailed the occurrence of syndromic expression of neurological involvement in COVID-19 and probed the association of neurological indices with disease severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19 (https://n.neurology.org/content/97/23/e2269). By analysing data from 55 countries, they identified 41 neurological manifestations that can occur in conjunction with COVID-19. Up to one-third of individuals with COVID-19 were estimated to exhibit at least one of these manifestations.

[A] 3rd COVID vaccine boosts antibodies that neutralize omicron

A 3rd dose of COVID-19 vaccine successfully raises antibody levels that neutralize the omicron variant, according to laboratory findings from scientists from the United Kingdom published yesterday [19 Jan 2022] in The Lancet (https://bit.ly/3fP67oe).

Researchers from the Francis Crick Institute (FCI) and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) UCLH Biomedical Research Centre used a high-throughput live SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay to determine neutralizing antibody titers against omicron, alpha, and delta variants in 620 serum samples from 364 people. They found that antibodies generated in people who had received only 2 doses of either the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine or the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine were less able to neutralize the omicron variant compared with the other 2 variants.

They also found that antibody levels dropped off in the first 3 months following the 2nd dose but that a 3rd dose raised levels of antibodies that effectively neutralized the omicron variant. The study did not assess vaccine effectiveness, only antibody activity in the lab. Antibody levels against omicron after a 3rd Pfizer dose were similar to those reached against delta after 2 doses. Antibody levels were nearly 2.5 times higher against omicron after 3 doses compared with after 2. Higher levels of antibodies against omicron were also found in people who previously had COVID-19 symptoms and received 2 doses of either vaccine, compared with those who had not had prior COVID-19 symptoms.

Study author Emma Wall, senior clinical research fellow at FCI and infectious disease specialist with UCLH, said in an FCI news release, "People who have queued outside vaccinations centres should be reassured that a vaccine booster is the best way of protecting them from omicron. And for people who haven't yet had a booster or even a 1st dose, it's not too late." Co-author Sonia Gandhi, legacy chief investigator at FCI and a consultant neurologist at UCLH, said, "Future research will need to address the duration and persistence of this booster response" (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/940572).

COVID-19 case counts and deaths were much higher among children and teens hospitalized for the virus in 6 sub-Saharan African countries -- particularly in infants and those with certain underlying noninfectious diseases -- than in other countries, found a multinational study published yesterday [19 Jan 2022] in JAMA Pediatrics (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2788373).

The researchers reviewed data from 25 hospitals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Uganda from 1 Mar 2020 to 31 Dec 2020. The study included 469 hospitalized COVID-19 patients 0-19 years old. Median age was 5.9 years, and 24.5% had underlying illnesses.

Eighteen patients (3.8%) had suspected or confirmed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and 8.3% died, including 22 of 69 patients (31.9%) admitted to an intensive care unit and 22.2% with MIS-C. In comparison, rates of 1%-5% for these outcomes have been reported in higher-income countries.

The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of more versus fewer severe outcomes among children younger than 1 year were 4.89 times higher than that of patients aged 15-19. Risk factors for poor outcomes included high blood pressure (aOR, 5.91), chronic lung disease (aOR, 2.97), and blood disorders (aOR, 3.10).

Age younger than 1 year (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [asHR], 0.48) and the presence of 1 or 2 or more illnesses (asHR, 0.54 and 0.26, respectively) were tied to lower rates of hospital release.

"If a child has a comorbidity, is very young and is in a place where there are limited or no specialized doctors, facilities or equipment for pediatric intensive care, then that child faces a very real possibility of dying," lead author Jean Nachega, of the University of Pittsburgh, said in a press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/940505).

In a related editorial, Ethwako Mlia-Phiri, of Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi, and colleagues said that despite the outsized impact of COVID-19 on sub-Saharan African children, preventive and therapeutic options are largely unavailable to them (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2788374). "The vaccine equity gap, which has disproportionate consequences for [low- and middle-income countries], remains a major factor associated with the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide," they wrote.

[C] UK: COVID testing

A new study based on 4 million British participants shows mild symptoms, a lack of knowledge about testing site locations, and confusion about COVID-19-specific symptoms were all risk factors for not getting tested for the novel coronavirus. The study was published yesterday [19 Jan 2022] in PLOS Global Public Health (https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0000028).

The study was based on 4.4 million responses gathered in the Zoe COVID Symptom Study smartphone app for self-reporting symptoms and test results. Researchers sent follow-up surveys at the end of 2020 to almost 5000 people who reported COVID-19 symptoms but reported taking no test.

In total, 40.4% of survey respondents were not able to name all 3 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test-qualifying symptoms, which included a fever; a new continuous cough, or a change in their sense of smell or taste. Users were less likely to get a free test if they had only one COVID-19 symptom compared with peers with multiple symptoms (27.1% vs 14.6%, P < 0.001). If symptoms were short-lived, people were also less likely to get tested (symptoms lasting 1 or 2 days) than those with longer-lasting symptoms (30.1% vs 14.6%, P < 0.001).

The study also mined UK responses from the University of Maryland survey administered to Facebook users (The Global COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey), which found that not knowing where testing sites were located was cited 32.4% of the time as the primary reason someone who wanted a test did not get one. "Knowing when and where to get a test is crucial to curbing COVID-19 transmission, yet 1 in 4 people with the UK test-qualifying symptoms of fever, cough, or loss of smell did not get tested," the authors said in a PLoS press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/9398898). "Over a third of these individuals did not recognize the 3 symptoms that would qualify them for a test, and about a third of those who wanted testing did not know where to go, indicating that more effective education is needed to close the testing gap."

[For those who wish to see the detailed global data, a snapshot of the Worldometer table at the time we accessed it is available at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WORLDDATA%20JAN20_1642875575.pdf.

A 7-day series of cumulative totals reported by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20JAN20WORLD7_1642875788.pdf. It is from this table that numbers in the following commentary are derived.

In the past 24 hours, 41 countries -- the USA (736 512), France (425 183), India (344 859), Italy (188 797), Brazil (168 060), Spain (157 447), Germany (134 930), Argentina (129 709), the UK (106 533), Turkey (71 849), Israel (68 513), Australia (63 941), Portugal (56 426), Peru (54 942), Mexico (50 373), Sweden (41 374), Netherlands (39 920), Switzerland (39 689), Russia (38 850), Denmark (37 987), Poland (32 835), Philippines (30 853), Colombia (30 506), Czech Republic (26 082), Canada (23 912), Guadeloupe (20 806), Romania (19 105), Greece (18 867), Ukraine (18 479), Serbia (17 105), Norway (16 877), Vietnam (16 715), Hungary (15 526), Chile (13 865), Uruguay (12 997), Tunisia (12 698), Panama (12 351), Croatia (11 343), Bangladesh (10 888), Slovenia (10 308), and Nepal (10 052) -- all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 9333 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 19 Jan 2022 to late 20 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 93 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours (up from 78 on the previous day, 19 Jan 2022); 44 of the 93 countries are from the European region, 18 are from the Americas region, 16 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 5 from the South East Asia region, and 4 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 9.9%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 9.8%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 6.4% decrease in daily reported cases and a 9.9% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: Over 3.4 million newly confirmed infections were reported worldwide in the past 24 hours. In total over 343.04 million cases and over 5.59 million deaths have been reported. Transmission continues at a very high level. - Mod.MPP]
