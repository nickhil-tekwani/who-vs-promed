Yellow Fever in Guinea
----------------------
As of 7 Jan 2005, WHO has received reports of an outbreak of yellow fever
in the region of Faranah, in the north of the country. 6 cases have been
reported from 19 Oct to 28 Nov 2004 and have been laboratory-confirmed by
the WHO Collaborating Centre for Yellow Fever, the Institut Pasteur, Dakar,
Senegal.
A team from the Ministry of Health (MoH), Guinea and WHO quickly
investigated the 1st cases, and surveillance has been intensified. The MoH
with WHO support organised a yellow fever mass vaccination campaign in
December 2004 to control the disease spread in this region. No additional
cases have been reported so far.
