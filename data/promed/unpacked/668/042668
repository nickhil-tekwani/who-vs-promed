Update on Mild Respiratory Outbreak, BC:
RT-PCR and Serological Tests positive by SARS coV Diagnostics
-----------------------------------------
The British Columbia Centre for Disease Control and Fraser Health Authority
continue to investigate an outbreak of largely mild respiratory disease in
a long-term care facility from which diagnostic specimens (RT-PCR) and
serology are reactive by tests designed to identify the SARS Co-V.
Setting:
------
A long-term care facility of 142 residents and 160 full- and part-time staff
in the lower mainland of British Columbia.
Epidemiology:
---------
For the purposes of this description, the case definition in use is one of
any respiratory symptoms (cough, rhinitis, fever, etc.) after 1 Jul 2003.
The epidemic curve to 18 Aug 2003 is posted at <http://www.bccdc.org> with
updates to follow.
As of 19 Aug 2003 there has been illness in 94 of 142 residents (elderly or
disabled) and 49 of 160 staff. (The count for residents has gone down from
earlier postings due to a record review and application of the case
definition).
11 residents remain symptomatic and isolated, 1 is hospitalized and isolated.
2 staff members remain with symptoms and 4 are excluded from work.
Clinical Spectrum:
--------------
Staff: Among 49 affected staff, symptoms have been mild (coryza, cough), and
there have been no cases of pneumonia, hospitalization, or death.
Residents: Among affected residents, mild symptoms have been the general rule
(fever 20 percent, cough 62 percent, rhinitis 60 percent). However,
pneumonia has occurred in 10 residents connected with the outbreak, with 9
hospitalizations in which pneumonia contributed along with other underlying
illness.
11 deaths have been recorded in the facility over the past 7.5 weeks
(baseline mortality at the facility runs approximately 4 per month). In 6
cases, pneumonia was present at death (though often with other factors),
there were 2 vascular deaths and 3 deaths occurred in residents under
palliative conditions who had been in decline from prior to the onset of the
outbreak.
A clinical-pathological review is under way of all pneumonia cases,
hospitalizations, and deaths. Early reports from the team have indicated
that:
- radiographic picture of pneumonia has most often been lobar
- diffuse atypical pneumonia patterns are not yet reported from the review
and ARDS has not been observed
- pathology from one patient deceased with a positive [SARS] PCR (cause of
death was vascular) revealed no ARDS, hyaline membrane formation etc.
More to follow on these reviews.
Microbiology:
-----------
A broad array of testing for typical bacteria, atypicals (Mycoplasma, _C.
pneumoniae_, psittacosis, legionella) and conventional viral etiologies
(influenza, parainfluenza 1-4, RSV, adenovirus, enterovirus, etc.) have
been negative.
4 patients tested positive at the National Medical Laboratory (NML) for
human metapneumovirus.
SARS Co-V testing:
----------------
RT-PCR was reactive on an initial 9/19 patients for whom specimens were
evaluated. This testing involved several primer sets and was conducted in
2 separate laboratories at the NML.
Serological testing on 4/7 initially tested patients was reactive at the NML.
One patient was positive both by PCR and serology.
Preliminary sequencing work at NML of a total of 750 bp yields close match
to SARS Co-V. About 98 percent of the genome of this agent remains
unexplored -- a mutation or deletion in any part of which might account for
the observed clinical picture.
Many more specimens have been collected and are currently being processed.
Further PCR, serological and sequencing work is under way at the BC Centre
for Disease Control, Canadian National Medical Laboratory and the British
Columbia Cancer Agency's Michael Smith Genome Science Centre to confirm and
clarify these findings. In addition, aliquots of sera have also been
forwarded to CDC Atlanta for independent evaluation.
Synthesis:
-------
The identification of an agent testing positive for SARS Co-V in this
setting of generally mild disease may seem surprising, but is the result of
deliberate efforts to look for re-emergent SARS Co-V or related agents.
Possibilities at present:
--------------------
1) This could be SARS Co-V exhibiting a milder clinical spectrum than
previously described. This might be conceivable given the earlier focus on
severe respiratory disease in case definitions used globally.
2) This could be an attenuated SARS Co-V with an important deletion or
mutation accounting for a different clinical picture
3) This might still be a closely related agent now detectable by newly
invented tests.
(Laboratory artifact seems unlikely given a convergence of findings using
various technologies in different locations).
Of note, the existing descriptions of disease causes by other human
coronaviruses (e.g., OC 43) include the spectrum from common cold to
pneumonia.
Present Actions:
--------------
Fraser Health Authority and BCCDC are employing SARS-type precautions
around symptomatic people and their contacts, strictly limiting visits to
the facility, restricting staff movement between institutions, and
maintaining enhanced surveillance for unusual patterns of respiratory
illness elsewhere -- including SARS coV testing of any cases of ARDS and
of atypical pneumonia presenting to acute care institutions. Even prior to
this event, facilities have been using enhanced respiratory precautions.
Further epidemiologic characterization of this event is taking the course of:
- the above-mentioned intensive clinical / pathological review
- a deliberate attempt to seek links between this event and any known SARS
coV activity globally
- further analysis of patterns of illness in contacts
- continued tracking of the course in the facility.
And key -- we are working on obtaining sufficient RNA through viral
propagation or specimen extraction to get a broad view of the genome of the
agent.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Patrick very much for rapidly sharing
this authoritative report on the status of this outbreak investigation.

From its clinical description, this does not appear to be the same illness
that was seen with the SARS outbreak earlier this year. It is also curious
that the pneumonia deaths described were not consistent with the SARS-
associated pneumonias that had an "atypical" picture and were associated with
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Information from autopsy reports
will be of interest, to see whether the pneumonia deaths were primary viral
mediated or were secondary bacterial pneumonia, as is often seen following
viral respiratory illnesses in the elderly and immuno-impaired population.
We await further information as it becomes available. - Mod.MPP]
