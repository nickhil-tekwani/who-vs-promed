[1] Norway: cases soaring

https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/2021/08/almost-90-countrys-population-vaccinated-number-new-covid-cases-still-rockets


According to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, a total of 1134 people on 23 Aug 2021 tested positive for the coronavirus, an increase of almost 50% in a week. The number is the biggest ever registered in one day since the pandemic reached the country.

More than 35% of the new infections are found among young people aged 10-19 years, and another 25% among people aged 20-29 years. Meanwhile, only about 3% of the new cases is found among people over 60. Several schools across the country now report about a big number of cases among kids.

Meanwhile, almost none of the new infected people end up in intensive hospital care. In the course of August [2021], only 15 people have been provided intensive care, information from the public health institute shows.

The hike in new cases comes as the national vaccination program is rolled out to most of the country's adults. As of 26 Aug 2021, as much as 88.4% of Norwegians over 18 years had received at least one jab. And 62.4% had got both jabs.

The vaccination numbers are due to continue to increase rapidly over the next weeks as more doses are supplied to the country. Vaccine supplies the week of 16-22 Aug 2021 reached more than 385 000 doses, most of them BioNTech/Pfizer, the Public Health Institute informs. Norway now foresees that more than 90% of its population will have received both jabs in the course of September [2021].

The Nordic country in early August [2021] decided that also young people aged 16-17 will be offered the vaccine, and the health authorities are considering also to include the 12-15-year-old age-group.

In the course of the pandemic, Norway has had a total of 152 113 COVID cases. A total of 4842 have been hospitalised, of them 913 in intensive care, and 814 have died.

Summary
------
What is already known about this topic?
Viral infections are a common cause of myocarditis. Some studies have indicated an association between COVID-19 and myocarditis.

What is added by this report?
During March 2020 to January 2021, patients with COVID-19 had nearly 16 times the risk for myocarditis compared with patients who did not have COVID-19, and risk varied by sex and age.

What are the implications for public health practice?
These findings underscore the importance of implementing evidence-based COVID-19 prevention strategies, including vaccination, to reduce the public health impact of COVID-19 and its associated complications.

Viral infections are a common cause of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle (myocardium) that can result in hospitalization, heart failure, and sudden death (1). Emerging data suggest an association between COVID-19 and myocarditis (2-5). CDC assessed this association using a large, US hospital-based administrative database of healthcare encounters from more than 900 hospitals. Myocarditis inpatient encounters were 42.3% higher in 2020 than in 2019. Overall, myocarditis was uncommon among persons with and without COVID-19; however, COVID-19 was significantly associated with an increased risk for myocarditis, with risk varying by age-group. These findings underscore the importance of implementing evidence-based COVID-19 prevention strategies, including vaccination, to reduce the public health impact of COVID-19 and its associated complications.

Discussion
----------
In this study, the occurrence of myocarditis inpatient encounters was 42% higher in 2020 than in 2019. The risk for myocarditis among patients with COVID-19 during March 2020 to January 2021 was nearly 16 times as high as the risk among patients without COVID-19, with the association between COVID-19 and myocarditis being most pronounced among children and older adults. Further, in this cohort, approximately 40% of patients with myocarditis had a history of COVID-19.

These findings suggest an association between COVID-19 and myocarditis, although causality cannot be inferred from observational data, and are consistent with those from previous studies (2-5). Before this report, the 2 largest known studies, in the United States and in Israel, also found that COVID-19 was strongly associated with myocarditis.

In this study, the association between COVID-19 and myocarditis was lowest for persons aged 25-39 years and higher among younger (less than 16 years) and older (over 50 years) age-groups, a pattern that has not been previously described in age-stratified analyses and that warrants further investigation. This finding might be partially explained by age-related differences in COVID-19 case ascertainment, because younger adults with less severe disease might be less likely than older adults to have a health care encounter with a COVID-19 diagnosis captured within PHD-SR. This age-related differential misclassification (underascertainment) of COVID-19 status might bias risk differences and risk ratios toward the null more for younger adults and could partially explain the observed age-related association.

The risk difference for myocarditis between persons with and without COVID-19 was higher among males than among females, consistent with some earlier studies (2,5). The finding of a higher risk ratio among females than among males is novel. However, it likely reflects the low risk for myocarditis among female patients without COVID-19 (5).

Although the exact mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection possibly leading to myocarditis is unknown, the pathophysiology is likely similar to that of other viruses (1). Among persons with COVID-19 and myocarditis, some myocarditis diagnoses might represent cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS), particularly among children aged under 16 years (9). Further study is warranted to understand how the clinical course of myocarditis among patients with COVID-19 might differ by presence or absence of MIS (10).

American parents are split on whether mask mandates belong in schools, and universities grapple with mandating vaccines, as the nation returns to classrooms and campuses amid the 4th pandemic surge, this one fueled by the highly transmissible delta (B1617.2) variant.

A new Gallup Poll shows 48% of K-12 parents think students should be required to wear masks at school, while 41% oppose student mask mandates. Similarly, 48% say teachers and staff should be required to wear masks, and 38% say they should not (https://news.gallup.com/poll/354203/parents-divided-mask-mandates-school.aspx).

One area parents are not split on: a return to in-person learning. After 18 months of hybrid, virtual, and some in-person instruction, 77% of poll respondents said they expect their child will return to a pre-pandemic school schedule this year [2021].

Yesterday [30 Aug 2021] the Florida Department of Education issued its 1st sanctions against school boards that have enacted mask mandates, defying a recent ruling from a state judge, Politico reports. The department is withholding salaries from school board members in Alachua and Broward counties (https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2021/08/30/florida-defies-judge-and-punishes-two-school-districts-over-masks-1390582).

In order to usher in a more normal school year, White House officials today [31 Aug 2021] urged school districts and universities to look at vaccination requirements. "Vaccination requirements work; they drive up vaccination rates," said Jeff Zients, the White House COVID-19 response coordinator. He said states and communities that have mandated vaccines have seen a recent uptake in vaccinations.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID Data Tracker shows 52.4% of Americans are fully vaccinated, and 61.7% have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

Liberty University in Virginia shifted to online classes yesterday [30 Aug 2021], only a week after the semester began, because of a spike in COVID-19 cases, according to the Washington Post. The school does not require students or staff to be vaccinated or wear masks (https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2021/08/30/liberty-university-covid-virtual-quarantine).

In related news, Duke University enacted a vaccine mandate for staff and a mask requirement for the entire campus yesterday [30 Aug 2021], after a COVID-19 outbreak infected nearly 350 students and 15 employees, CNBC reports (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/30/duke-university-mandates-covid-vaccines-for-staff-following-outbreak.html).

Today [31 Aug 2021] during the White House press briefing, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, said the 7-day average of new cases rose to 129 000 per day, including 11 500 hospital admissions per day.

The American Academy of Pediatrics reports that 204 000 COVID-19 cases in children were reported for the week ending 26 Aug 2021, marking the 2nd week with child cases at the level of the winter surge. Children represent 22.4% of new COVID-19 cases, and since the pandemic began, they represent 14.8% of US cases (https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/).

Yesterday [30 Aug 2021], according to the New York Times tracker, the country recorded 158 946 cases, including 1338 deaths. US pandemic totals have climbed to 39 134 705 cases and 639 490 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins online tracker.

Hot spots remain focused in the South. New data from the Department of Health and Human Services show Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, and Texas have less than 10% left of their intensive care unit capacity, CNN reports (https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/31/health/us-coronavirus-tuesday/index.html).

Today [31 Aug 2021] the CDC published in Morbidity and Mortality and Weekly Report (MMWR) evidence that gatherings with adolescents and adults who were not required to be vaccinated or be subjected to testing led to large outbreaks, based on data from the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH; http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7035e4).

During a 5-day overnight church camp for people aged 14-18 years and a 2-day men's conference, a total of 122 primary cases of COVID-19 were confirmed, with 104 (85%) in people who were not fully vaccinated and 18 (15%) in fully vaccinated persons. Eight of 38 (21%) close contacts of the 18 fully vaccinated persons subsequently became infected with SARS-CoV-2, the authors said, and no vaccinated people with COVID-19 were hospitalized.

"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from vaccinated persons both to unvaccinated and vaccinated persons likely occurred. These breakthrough cases among vaccinated persons were identified among attendees of the camp and the conference and in persons exposed to the attendees," the authors said. "Consistent with previous studies, much of the identified secondary transmission occurred within households, where most prolonged contact occurs."

Other US developments
---------------------
Only 20% of Americans now say they are not very likely (6%) or not at all likely (14%) to get the COVID-19 vaccine, according to a new Axios-Ipsos poll. That's down from a combined 34% in March [2021] and 23% from 2 weeks ago (https://www.axios.com/axios-ipsos-poll-vaccine-hesitancy-crumbling-9ffe938f-5b9b-4707-bfe4-f7c3dc559ba9.html).

Novavax said yesterday [30 Aug 2021] that, for participants in its recombinant vaccine trial, the CDC considers people fully vaccinated 2 weeks after they've received their 2nd dose (https://ir.novavax.com/2021-08-30-Novavax-Statement-on-CDC-Guidance-Update-for-COVID-19-Clinical-Trial-Participants).

[From NPR, National Public Radio (https://www.npr.org/sections/back-to-school-live-updates/2021/08/30/1032520335/education-department-civil-rights-investigations-mask-mandates):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"The US Department of Education sent a warning to 5 states on Monday [30 Aug 2021] that their statewide bans on mask mandates, including in schools, could violate students' civil rights. Suzanne B. Goldberg, the department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights, sent letters to state education leaders in Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah, informing them that the department's Office for Civil Rights is investigating whether their bans are discriminatory.

"At the center of the department's concerns, according to Monday's letters, are students with disabilities who may be at heightened risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Goldberg's letters say these investigations will focus on whether the state bans are discriminatory by preventing students with disabilities from safely returning to in-person education.

"Federal law 'guarantees qualified students with disabilities the right to a free appropriate public education in elementary and secondary school,' Goldberg wrote in each of the letters. 'This includes the right of students with disabilities to receive their education in the regular educational environment, alongside their peers without disabilities, to the maximum extent appropriate to their needs.'

"If students with disabilities do not feel safe returning to school because their classmates cannot be required to wear masks, the department's argument goes, then these bans could be considered discriminatory and violate either Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and/or Title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990."

It is children who are being placed at risk by these bans by states in the USA on mask mandates. Politicizing such an important measure to control virus spread in schools, in the absence of an approved vaccine for children, is foolhardy. - Mod.LK]

[4] South Africa: new variant C.1.2
Date: Tue 31 Aug 2021 17:32 SAST
Source: The Conversation [edited]
https://theconversation.com/amp/south-african-health-experts-have-identified-a-new-lineage-of-sars-cov-2-whats-known-so-far-167057


As a team of South African researchers, we have identified a new lineage of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. A lineage represents a genetically distinct virus population with a common ancestor. This virus may be designated as a variant in future, based on significantly altered properties, but first we need to understand it better. Our findings so far are set out in a non-pre-peer-reviewed paper.

The new lineage, assigned the name C.1.2, has been found in all provinces in the country. While it shares some mutations with other variants, it is different in some respects.

Viruses mutate all the time. Sometimes the mutations result in an added benefit for the virus, such as increased transmissibility. But often mutations don't do anything beneficial for the virus. So more mutations do not always mean trouble for us, its host.

For C.1.2, a lot is still unknown. For example, it's too early to tell whether these mutations will affect transmissibility or vaccine efficacy.

The Network for Genomics Surveillance in South Africa has been monitoring changes in SARS-CoV-2 since March 2020. South Africa was one of the 1st countries globally to introduce systematic and coordinated genomic surveillance, sequencing genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from patient samples representative of different geographic regions and over time.

Its findings have provided insights into how and when SARS-CoV-2 was introduced into the country, and into its early spread. The Network has also been sequencing virus genomes to identify newly developing viral lineages of particular concern.

Later in 2020 the network detected what is now called the beta variant of concern and more recently observed, almost in real-time, the arrival and rapid "take-over" of the delta variant in South Africa.

We select patient samples from diagnostic laboratories throughout the country and perform sequencing to analyse the virus genomes. We then compare these sequences to those seen before and elsewhere. It's very much like the game where you spot the difference between nearly identical pictures.

We're playing spot the difference with SARS-CoV-2. When we find many differences -- or differences in certain particularly important places like the spike of the virus -- we pay special attention. We then look to see how often we see this particular virus and where -- in one region of the country or in multiple regions, only in South Africa or also in other parts of the world. We also monitor whether it increases over time, which would suggest that it is replacing previous versions of the virus.

When we sequence the virus and compare it to other SARS-CoV-2 viruses, it gets assigned a name based on the closest matching virus. We then look at the virus and the one that it matches to see how similar they are to each other. If we see a lot of differences that could be an indication of a new lineage.

In May 2021 we first detected a mutated group of related SARS-CoV-2 viruses in South Africa which has been assigned the lineage, C.1.2. So far, from May to August 2021, C.1.2 has been detected in all provinces. Yet it occurs at relatively low frequency and though we see small increases in this lineage over time, they remain very low.

This lineage possesses mutations within the genome that have been seen in other SARS-CoV-2 variants.

The network alerted the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the South African National Department of Health to this lineage in July [2021]. The 2 months between our 1st discovery and the notification comes from the lengthy process of sequencing and analysis. In addition, mutated viruses appear from time to time -- but many disappear again. Therefore, we needed to monitor this particular one to see if it would be detected in additional regions. Only when we started detecting it in other provinces and when it was reported also from other countries did we feel we had sufficient evidence to suggest a new lineage.

The surveillance network is continuing to monitor the frequency of the lineage across the country, and helping other African countries do the same. Also, tests to assess the functional impact of the mutations it harbours are underway -- for example, how well do antibodies in people who have been vaccinated or infected previously neutralise the new virus, how well does it multiply in cell cultures compared to other virus variants, and so on.

The virus has not yet fulfilled the WHO criteria to be classified as a variant of interest or variant of concern. A variant of interest has genetic changes affecting important virus characteristics (transmissibility, disease severity, immune, diagnostic or therapeutic escape) and epidemiological impacts suggesting a risk to global public health. A variant of concern is the worst category -- it's a variant with proven increased transmissibility and/or virulence and/or decreased effectiveness of public health or medical tools such as vaccines, therapeutics and tests.

Delta is a good example of a variant of concern that rapidly came to dominate the epidemic globally, causing major waves in many countries including those with advanced vaccination roll-out programmes.

The C.1.2 lineage shares a few common mutations with all other variants of concern, including the beta, lambda and delta variants. But the new lineage has a number of additional mutations.

We are still gathering more data to understand the impact of this lineage on transmissibility and on vaccines. SARS-CoV-2, like all viruses, mutates with time, usually in a way that affords the virus some kind of advantage. Some of the mutations in the C.1.2 lineage have arisen in other SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest or concern. But we still don't have a full picture. It will take a combination of ongoing thorough surveillance (especially to see whether it perhaps displaces the currently prevalent delta variant) and laboratory-based studies to characterise its properties.

Based on our current understanding of the mutations in this particular lineage, we suspect that it might be able to partially evade the immune response. Despite this, however, our view based on what we know now is that vaccines will still offer high levels of protection against hospitalisation and death.

We expect new variants to continue to emerge wherever the virus is spreading. Vaccination remains critical to protect those in our communities at high risk of hospitalisation and death, to reduce the strain on the health system, and to help slow transmission. This has to be combined with all the other public health and social measures.

We therefore advise the public to remain vigilant and continue to follow COVID-19 protocol by including good ventilation in all shared spaces and wearing masks that cover your nose, mouth and chin. These non-pharmaceutical interventions are still shown to be preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 irrespective of the variant.

We are also of the view that the mutated lineage is unlikely to affect the sensitivity of PCR tests. These tests typically detect at least 2 different parts of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which serves as a backup in the case of a mutation arising in one of them. Studies are ongoing to assess any implications for diagnostic testing.

The Network for Genomic Surveillance in South Africa links National Health Laboratory Service and private COVID-19 testing laboratories to academic sequencing centres. This collaboration has allowed South African experts to rapidly generate and analyse sequence data to inform regional and national responses.

As of late August 2021, the delta variant accounted for over 90% of sequences in Southern Africa. But virus evolution is ongoing, as long as the virus can spread from person to person, multiply, and be passed on. It is thus necessary to continue monitoring its evolution, to detect new problematic properties early and institute countermeasures, where possible.

[This is a very measured report on the status of the new variant reported in the preprint by Scheepers et al (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.20.21262342) and reported on yesterday (31 Aug 2021) in ProMED COVID-19 update (299): new delta variants, antibody response to RNA vaccine, WHO 20210831.8635714.

Also see Tulio de Oliveira (https://twitter.com/Tuliodna): "Thanks to colleagues from the Network for Genomic Surveillance in South Africa (NGS-SA) to work around the clock on a piece for the general public that highlight what we know so far of the C.1.2" and "Another non-scientific fact is that the C.1.2 evolves at double the speed. See comparison with other variants, please note that more recent variants normally have a higher mutation (as they are recent!) and that more mutations at Spike are not necessarily worst, see delta."

Also see tweets from Maria Van Kerkhove (mvankerkhove; https://twitter.com/mvankerkhove/status/1432403717018603529): "We are grateful for researchers in South Africa who first presented their findings on variant C.1.2 to the WHO Virus Evolution Working Group in July '21.

"To date there are approx 100 sequences of C.1.2 reported globally, the earliest reports from May '21 from South Africa.

"At this time, C.1.2 does not appear to be [increasing] in circulation, but we need more sequencing to be conducted & shared globally. Delta appears dominant from available sequences."

Note that this should put into perspective the comment on the mutation rate of this new variant C.1.2 made in the tweet included in the ProMED post yesterday (31 Aug 2021). - Mod.LK]
