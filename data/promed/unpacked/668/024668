Farmers and scientists are battling to solve the mystery behind hundreds of unexplained cattle deaths in South Australia. It has been nicknamed "the November disease". Farmers across the southern Flinders Ranges will find cattle dead in the paddock without an explanation from October through to February. [Presumably this statement describes their experience rather than predicting the future. - Mod.SH]

A beef and sheep farmer first saw the fatalities in 1996 and lost 61 head of cattle in his last year as a cattle producer. "They'd come into the trough, most of them would die on the trough," he said. "They'd come in and have the staggers and the eyes would be sunken back into the head. The poor buggers would dehydrate and virtually just die within 4 days." [He] said the mystery deaths would occur in years when there was greater rain and more pasture in the paddocks.

Suspects so far include plant poisoning, bacterial infections, and copper deficiencies, but the ultimate cause is not yet known.

[The farmer] said the deaths, which have cost producers in the region hundreds of thousands of dollars, have been hard to fathom, because they seemingly occur at random. "That's the silly thing about it, we've got sheep running next to them and horses and they eat exactly the same grass as what's out there," he said. "I've got 2 neighbours next door who haven't lost any cattle, and then the neighbour to the north he did lose cattle, so it's very unusual. We were told that it's not contagious in any way, but it's still a worry because you don't know. All we know is it's something in the grasses, it's a toxin. But until they pinpoint it we just don't know."

PIRSA [Department of Primary Industries and Regions, South Australia] Biosecurity SA has been investigating the cattle deaths, including 191 deaths that occurred in the Cradock area during the 2014-15 summer periods. A spokesperson for PIRSA said staff had been working with affected livestock owners and other producers in the area to ascertain the contributing factors and causes behind the deaths. "Anecdotally this area has recorded a series of cattle death clusters dating back to the early 20th century, but very little research or investigation occurred in earlier years to pinpoint the cause of these clusters," the spokesperson said.

"Necropsies on animals affected during this latest cluster have shown a number of causal factors including plant poisoning, bacterial infections, and copper deficiencies, with further detailed veterinary analysis required. Indications from the investigation work that has occurred so far are that no exotic diseases are responsible for these unexplained deaths."

While farmers and scientists are left puzzling over the unexplained deaths, [the farmer] said the cost of losing livestock had forced him out of the cattle industry. But he said he was concerned with the continuing costs for other cattle farmers in the region. "I sold the remaining mob of cattle I had," he said.

"When you get over AUD 1000 [about USD 715] each it made you realise what you'd lost out there in the paddock. To me, I've gone out, but for [other farmers] they've got to live on that knife's edge now and just knowing it can come back any time there's a good year. It can come back and that's a worrying concern for all the cattle producers."

[Cases like this can be extremely frustrating and baffling. It may require a case coordinator to keep careful notes on every case, including photographs and records of the time of year, temperatures, rainfalls, etc and a botanist to walk the pastures at various stages of growth. It may be a plant, or a fungus. It may occur early in the plant cycle, or only after the plant has matured and produced seeds. It may take a lot of soil testing, even in years when there are no losses, to start seeing any connection between cases. It is also important to know vaccination histories and pasture histories of any chemicals applied.

This is a challenging case and may or may not involve even a new and as yet undiagnosed disease. Research is needed and it may be up to the government to fund such research.

In 2014 New South Wales experienced what was called 3D syndrome, drooling, diarrhea, and death. But this syndrome sounds quite different. - Mod.TG
