Avian Influenza A (H5N1 Virus - WHO update 25
---------------------------------------------
Situation (human) in Viet Nam
-----------------------------
Laboratory tests have today confirmed an additional case of avian influenza
A (H5N1) virus infection in Viet Nam. The patient is a 15-year-old boy from
Thanh Hoa Province, who was admitted to hospital on 9 Feb 2004. He remains
under treatment in Thanh Hoa Hospital.
Altogether, 21 cases, 14 of them fatal, have been reported in Viet Nam.

Avian influenza A(H5N1) Virus Infection - WHO Update 26
-------------------------------------------------------
Situation (human) in Thailand
-----------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has today confirmed an additional
case of avian influenza A (H5N1) infection. The case, which was fatal, was
a 4-year-old boy from Khon Kaen Province. He died on 3 Feb 2004.
To date, Thailand has reported 9 cases of human H5N1 infection. Of these, 7
were fatal.
Situation (human) in Viet Nam
-----------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has today confirmed an additional case
of H5N1 infection. Further details about the case, which was fatal, are
pending. To date, Viet Nam has reported 22 cases of human H5N1 infection. Of
these, 15 were fatal.
[These figures taken together bring the total for East Asia to 31 laboratory-
confirmed cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection, of whom 22 have
died. - Mod.CP]
Situation (poultry) in Asia
---------------------------
Highly pathogenic avian influenza, caused by the avian influenza A (H5N1)
strain, is currently infecting poultry in 8 Asian countries. Full control
has not yet been achieved in any of these countries, despite intensive
efforts in many. Past experience with outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian
influenza, previously considered rare, has demonstrated the difficulty of
fully eliminating the virus in bird populations. Control has often taken
several years, even under favourable circumstances (small geographical
area, concentration in commercial production facilities). In past
outbreaks, investigations have shown that infection can be introduced into
domestic flocks by wild aquatic birds, including migratory birds capable of
flying long distances. The virus multiplies in the intestines of these
birds, which can carry the virus without developing signs of infection, and
very large quantities of virus are shed in faeces. Once introduced into
domestic flocks, the virus, which is highly contagious, can be mechanically
carried from farm to farm via contaminated items, such as vehicles,
clothing, and equipment.
Water sources contaminated by droppings from wild birds and shared by
domestic poultry are just one example of how chains of transmission can be
sustained once the virus becomes widespread in the environment. In the
present outbreaks, the tendency to hide or smuggle especially valuable
birds, such as fighting cocks, can also help maintain the virus in the
environment or contribute to its further geographical spread.
The present situation in Asia is historically unprecedented and extremely
challenging. Many affected countries are reporting highly pathogenic H5N1
infection in birds for the first time in their histories. In some of these
countries, around 80 percent of the poultry are produced in small backyard
farms scattered throughout rural areas, further complicating control.
Complete elimination of the virus is becoming increasingly challenging. As
explained below, the consequences for human health could be considerable.
China - Outbreaks of H5N1 infection in poultry, first reported on 27 Jan
2004, have continued to spread. To date, authorities have reported 52
outbreaks at poultry farms, of which 43 have been confirmed as caused by
H5N1 virus. Altogether, 16 of the country's 31 provinces, autonomous
regions, and municipalities have been affected. Xizang (Tibet) Autonomous
Region and Jilin Province are the most recently affected areas. As formally
reported to OIE on 11 Feb 2004, around 2.3 million poultry have been culled.
Japan - Authorities have confirmed a small outbreak in Oita Prefecture as
caused by the H5 subtype. Further testing is under way to confirm the
possible involvement of the H5N1 strain.
Republic of Korea - On 7 Feb 2004, authorities reported new outbreaks at 8
duck farms, 7 chicken farms, and one mixed farm with chickens and ducks.
Around 350 000 birds died or were destroyed in the most recent outbreaks.
Thailand - Authorities in Thailand have today reported 14 new outbreaks in
various provinces, including one province where the disease had not been
reported previously. More than 27 million birds have either died or been
destroyed. Infections in chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, ostriches, quail,
and peacocks have been reported.
Viet Nam - Outbreaks have been detected in 57 of the country's 64 provinces
affected. More than 27 million birds have either died or been destroyed.
Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos - Information on the status of poultry outbreaks
in these countries is still being gathered.
Implications for human health
-----------------------------
Avian influenza A (H5N1) virus has demonstrated its capacity to directly
infect humans on 3 occasions in the recent past. The H5N1 virus is capable
of infecting a broad range of hosts, which may help explain recent media
reports of infections and deaths in mammalian and avian species not
normally considered susceptible to infection and severe disease.
In humans, the disease caused by avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection
differs from that usually caused by influenza viruses, where respiratory
symptoms are dominant. H5N1 has a documented ability to replicate in a wide
range of cell types, resulting in severe disseminated disease affecting
multiple organs and causing high mortality. These clinical features were
observed during the first recorded human outbreak of H5N1 infection in Hong
Kong in 1997. These features are being seen again in the earliest clinical
reports from Viet Nam and Thailand.
For all these reasons, the present situation in Asia needs to be watched
very carefully. Countries need to maintain a high level of vigilance, and
must not relax their surveillance and detection efforts. Intense efforts to
control the disease in poultry must continue in some countries and be
initiated in others. Preparedness measures for dealing with an incipient
pandemic situation, launched by WHO during January 2004, are continuing and
much progress is being made.
