In response to the posting on ProMED regarding the European Union's
imposition of extra quarantine requirements for Hendra virus infection on
the importation of cats from Australia, the Australian Quarantine and
Inspection Service (AQIS) makes the following comments.
The European Commission failed to consult with Australia over their
decision, which requires that cats from Australia be tested with negative
results for Hendra virus by an IgM and IgG capture ELISA. The IgM capture
ELISA is not available in Australia or to our knowledge anywhere else in the
world, for use in companion animals. For this reason Australia is unable to
comply with the EU requirements. In serological surveys conducted in
Australia, cats have been tested using the serum neutralisation test (SNT).
AQIS considers that this "safeguard" measure is scientifically unjustified.
On only 3 occasions has Hendra virus been detected outside the Australian
bat population. The virus was first identified following the occurrence of a
respiratory disease in humans and horses in the Brisbane suburb of Hendra in
Queensland in August 1994. The only other natural occurrences of the disease
in domestic species were in Mackay, Queensland in September 1994 where 2
horses and 1 person died (these were diagnosed retrospectively), and Trinity
Beach, Queensland in January 1999 where 1 horse died.
Following these incidents, an extensive serological survey was conducted
that included a large number of cats from the Brisbane area, surrounding
Hendra. A total of 564 cats were tested in this serological survey, all with
negative results.
Although cats can be experimentally infected when directly inoculated with
the virus, the disease has never been diagnosed in cats in association with
the rare occurrences of natural Hendra virus infection outside the bat
population. Experimentally infected cats develop an acute disease following
a short incubation, with all dying or requiring euthanasia within 9 days of
inoculation. It has been shown in transmission experiments that cats in
contact with infected horses do not seroconvert and show no histological
evidence of infection at necropsy.
Australia considers that testing for evidence of Hendra virus infection in
cats prior to export is unjustified:
- there has never been a diagnosis of natural infection of cats in Australia
- experimental studies have shown that transmissibility of the virus to cats
is low
- experimentally there is a short incubation period followed by an acute
fatal disease, which would be readily detected by veterinary authorities
before export
The EU has imposed, without any consultation whatsoever, a quarantine
measure that is epidemiologically unsound and based on a test that does not
exist for the species concerned. Australia has insisted that the EU
reconsider its position immediately.
