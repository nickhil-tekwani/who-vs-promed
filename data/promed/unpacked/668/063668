From: Lam Sai Kit, Kenneth <lamsk@medicine.med.um.edu.my>

We refer to the various postings that have appeared on ProMED re the above.
Thirty blood samples have been sent to us for investigation into the
possibility of an infective cause of the illness. The newspaper report
implied that the illness happened after swimming in a stream over the
weekend, but from the medical history provided with the samples, it was
noted that the children, including the fatal case, developed symptoms at
least a week after the swim.
The symptoms included fever, cough, headache, giddiness and vomiting. There
is no CNS manifestation. The fatal case also had haemoptysis [spitting up
blood and hypotension [low blood pressure.
Investigations of these samples will include serology for leptospirosis,
melioidosis, scrub typhus, hantaviruses, etc. We expect second blood
samples in the next 2 days and the results will be available soon after.
