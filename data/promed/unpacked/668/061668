Public health officials in a city in Chile have issued a warning after detecting several _Listeria_ infections linked to food. The Regional Ministerial Secretariat of Health (SEREMI) for Coquimbo reported there had been a recent increase in the region and urged caution to prevent further infections. Of 6 cases detected, at least 3 have been linked to eating contaminated food. The agency gave no further details about those sick.

Seremi de Salud [Regional Health Secretariat], Alejandro Garcia, said it was important to keep dairy products and cured meats refrigerated, follow recommendations made by the manufacturer, and discard any expired products.

Garcia added that vulnerable people such as newborns, those more than 60 years old, pregnant women and adults with chronic diseases, should not consume raw or undercooked fish, meat or sausages; pate, cheese spread, or ham sold in bulk, unwashed vegetables, and foods of unknown origin or bought in informal settings.

Health officials also advised people to wash hands before and after handling food and wash kitchen surfaces and utensils in contact with so-called risky foods before using them, avoid cross contamination by keeping raw and cooked foods separate and regularly clean the refrigerator.

In the past decade, _L. monocytogenes_ has emerged as a foodborne pathogen of major importance in Chile, according to a study published in the Food Microbiology journal in 2020 [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740002019302801]. Listeriosis has been a reportable disease in Chile since 2005. In 2008 and 2009, 2 large outbreaks occurred, associated with eating soft cheese and sausages or meat products.

Since then, there has been a slight increase in sporadic infections. According to official data, the number of reported cases between 2015 and 2018 was 75, 65, 83, and 97, respectively, with a mortality rate between 20 percent and 25 percent. Another study, published in the same year but in the journal Microorganisms, looked at the presence of _L. monocytogenes_ in artisanal ready-to-eat (RTE) foods in Chile.

Of 400 analyzed samples, 30 were positive for _Listeria_ including prepared meals and dishes, pre-processed fruit and vegetables, and cooked meats. Minimally processed RTE artisanal foods such as cooked meats and pre-processed fruit had the highest counts.

Food contaminated with _L. monocytogenes_ may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections. Anyone who has developed symptoms of _Listeria_ infection should seek medical treatment and tell their doctors about the possible Listeria exposure. Also, people should monitor themselves for food poisoning symptoms during the coming weeks because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to _Listeria_ for symptoms of listeriosis to develop.

Symptoms of _Listeria_ infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache, and neck stiffness. Specific laboratory tests are required to diagnose _Listeria_ infections, which can mimic other illnesses.

Pregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people such as cancer patients who have weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of serious illnesses, life-threatening infections, and other complications. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, their infections can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or even stillbirth.

[We are told in the news report above that of 6 cases of listeriosis reported in a city in the Coquimbo Region of Chile, at least 3 ate a "contaminated food," but we are not told what this food item is, in what city this occurred, and what the time-line, over which this outbreak occurred, is. Coquimbo is also a port city and capital of the Elqui Province, located in the Coquimbo Region of Chile. A map showing the location of the city of Coquimbo can be found at https://goo.gl/maps/bb8XzJQ8wuYhSgP9A.

In the USA, the CDC identifies a listeriosis outbreak when a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates have the same molecular pattern based on whole genome sequencing, suggesting a common food source. Epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the _Listeria_ case report from patients in the cluster to identify the common source.

Food items likely to be contaminated with _Listeria_, include soft cheeses and ready-to-eat refrigerated meat products that do not require further cooking before eating, such as smoked salmon, sushi, and cold cut meats. Even if initial contamination adds only a few _Listeria_ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods because _L. monocytogenes_ can multiply at refrigerator temperatures to a sufficient number to cause disease when the food is ingested.

People at increased risk for disseminated listeriosis, which include pregnant women (and their newborns), adults aged 65 years or older, and people with weakened immune systems, should avoid eating food potentially contaminated with _Listeria_.

PulseNet (a national laboratory network that collects information about _Listeria_ isolates) works with other federal food regulatory agencies (the US FDA and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA/FSIS) to find isolates found in food-monitoring programs that have similar genotypes, which would implicate them as the common source.

More information on this outbreak in Chile would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
