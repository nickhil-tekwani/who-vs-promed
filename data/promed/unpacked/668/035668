[1] USA: seafood plant outbreak
Date: Fri 5 Jun 2020 10:21 a.m. ET

https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/06/05/870312092/pacific-northwest-seafood-industry-faces-covid-19-outbreak-as-season-ramps-up?t=1591451998331


As America's meat producers confronted thousands of COVID-19 cases, Pacific Northwest seafood companies drafted rigorous plans to ward off similar spread of the disease in an industry where processors also work in close quarters.

But just a few weeks into the summer season, the industry has been shaken by its 1st major outbreak aboard a huge vessel with an onboard fish processing factory. This week, Seattle-based American Seafoods confirmed that 92 crew from its American Dynasty ship had tested positive for COVID-19, nearly 3/4 of the 126 people onboard.

"It was like, 'Wow, I can't believe this.' We had done so much. Each company had worked so hard to try to avoid this happening," says Brent Paine, executive director of United Catcher Boats.

The trade group's members fish for pollock and cod off Alaska, and another whitefish called hake off Washington and Oregon. "None of us have ever worked so hard in our lives than we have in the last 2 months, without a doubt."

There have been other COVID-19 cases among seafood workers in Alaska, where thousands have traveled from out-of-state for the world's largest salmon fishery. Some called for canceling this year's [2020] season, but the state pushed ahead with a range of new measures.

The American Dynasty, which is 30 feet shorter than a football field, had been fishing for hake before coming into port in Washington. A crew member reported feeling sick, then was taken ashore and tested positive for COVID-19, American Seafoods said in a statement.

A day later, the company reported another 85 cases, plus 6 more Thursday [4 Jun 2020]. Late Thursday evening, county health officials elsewhere in Washington reported that 25 crew members on 2 other American Seafoods vessels had also tested positive for COVID-19.

American Seafoods says it tested workers before they were allowed onboard for the hake fishery, but its minimum advance quarantine was just 5 days, prompting questions from industry observers and medical experts.

"That protocol, to me, does not make a lot of sense," says Geoffrey Gottlieb, an infectious disease physician at the University of Washington Medical Center.

Just as it can take 14 days for infected people to show COVID-19 symptoms, it can also take that long for the virus to be detectable in a test, he says. With a 5-day quarantine, "you might get away with it some of the time," he says. "But if enough boats or enough industries are doing this kind of thing, it's certainly likely that at some point that strategy is not going to work."

An American Seafoods spokeswoman, Suzanne Lagoni, says the company has since lengthened its required quarantine to 14 days.

[Some parts of the seafood production sector had to reduce their operational capacity or even shut down completely during the lockdown period, but as the lockdown restrictions begin to be eased, seafood businesses should follow advice and guidance on working safety. The above report highlights the need for all employers to carry out a COVID-19 risk assessment prior to reopening / enhancing the operations, with the objective to reduce workplace risk to the lowest reasonably practicable level by implementing preventative measures. Particularly where the social distancing guidelines cannot be followed in full, in relation to a particular activity, businesses should consider whether that activity needs to continue for the business to operate, and if so, take all the mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission between their staff such as
- increasing the frequency of handwashing and surface cleaning;
- keeping the activity time involved as short as possible;
- using screens or barriers to separate people from each other;
- using back-to-back or side-to-side working (rather than face-to-face) whenever possible;
- reducing the number of people each person has contact with by using "fixed teams or partnering" (so each person works with only a few others) (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/factories-plants-and-warehouses#factories-1-1). In addition, workforce management through staff shift management and educating staff members through open discussion and communication are effective tools to ensure a culture of safety and collective responsibility. - Mod.UBA]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 6 Jun 2020.

Highlights
----------
- Community health mobilizers are on the frontlines of Angola's COVID-19 response, increasing awareness of COVID-19 among the general population by conducting home visits and social mobilization campaigns in local markets and other busy communal areas.
- This year on World Environment Day on 5 Jun [2020], people around the world celebrated biodiversity and called for the preservation of nature, as human impact on the environment has increased the risk of emerging infectious diseases in humans: over 60% of emerging infectious diseases originate from animals, mainly from wildlife. The need to lessen our impact on the environment is being emphasised in the context of post-COVID-19 recovery, in order to reduce, at the source, the risk of future epidemics.
- WHO has published an updated interim guidance on key planning recommendations for mass gatherings in the context of COVID-19, which reflects the evolution of the pandemic and the most recent WHO recommendations on COVID-19, summarized in the "subject in focus" section.
- The guidance provides advice to host governments, health authorities, and event organizers on containing COVID-19 risks associated with a mass gathering, and on mitigating the likelihood of strain on health services.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 55.4% of the global newly reported cases and 68.9% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Brazil reported 43.6% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the USA 28.3%, Mexico 6.3%, Peru 6.0%, and Chile 5.9%.

The European region reported 15.1% of the global newly reported cases and 17.0% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Russia reported 45.9% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by the UK 8.6%, Sweden 5.5%, Turkey 4.8%, and Belarus 4.6%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 14.1% of the global newly reported cases and 5.4% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 26.3% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 16.0%, Saudi Arabia 14.4%, Qatar 9.7%, Egypt 7.5%, and Iraq 5.6%.

The African region reported 4.3% of the global newly reported cases and 1.8% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 48.4% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Cameroon at 11.0%, Nigeria at 6.0%, Ghana 5.2%, Cote d'Ivoire and Ethiopia at 3.1% each, and Central African Republic 3.0%.

The Western Pacific region reported 0.5% of the global newly reported cases and 0.19% of global fatalities. Singapore reported 41.0% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by the Philippines at 38.3%, South Korea 8.0%, Japan 6.1%, and Malaysia 3.0%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 6 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South-East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean, who are both approaching parity with the European region in terms of daily newly confirmed cases, and the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region greatly outnumbers all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.UBA]
