No high risk avian influenza viruses found in Canada's wild birds
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Government of Canada is committed to preventing the introduction of
avian influenza in Canada's domestic poultry flocks. Canada's 2007
Interagency Wild Bird Influenza Survey confirmed no findings of highly
pathogenic avian influenza in Canada's wild bird population.

Initially launched in 2005, the annual survey is a joint initiative between
federal, provincial, and territorial governments as well as the Canadian
Cooperative Wildlife Health Centre (CCWHC) and Canada's Avian Influenza
Laboratory Network.

The 2007 survey included testing of wild birds along main Canadian
migratory routes as well as in Iceland, where birds were sampled during
their migration from Western Europe to the Canadian Arctic.

As with previous surveys, the 2007 survey found various low pathogenicity
AI subtypes, including both H5 and H7. These detections are expected. Low
pathogenicity influenza viruses commonly circulate in wild birds with
little or no impact on the health of birds or people.

The 2008 survey is now under way. Annual monitoring of wild birds helps
animal health experts track and understand the viruses circulating
throughout Canada. Wild bird surveillance is one of the Government's key AI
prevention and preparedness initiatives.

A summary of results from 2005-2007 can be viewed on the CCWHC website at

[The results are worth checking out as they have been working hard and
thoroughly. In 2005, 4356 birds were tested in 9 provinces with 1598 (27
per cent) IV positive; in 2006, 9761 birds were tested in 11/13 provinces
with 1439 (15 per cent) influenza virus positive; and in 2007, 6687 birds
were tested in 10/13 provinces with 1434 (20 per cent) influenza virus
positive. All viruses isolated were North American influenza virus strains
of low virulence or apathogenic for chickens.

While no birds were tested in the Yukon Territory, North West Territories,
and Nunavut in 2007, there was good coverage in British Columbia (444) and
Alberta (844) in case anything had come across the Bering Straits from
Asia. In 2006 1784 birds were tested in Nunavut. Nice to have good news on
avian influenza viruses for a change. - Mod.MHJ]
