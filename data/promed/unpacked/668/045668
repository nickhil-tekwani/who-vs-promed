Egypt: Woman dies of bird flu, child infected
--------------------------------------------
An Egyptian woman died of bird flu in a Cairo hospital and a boy, 5,
became the 22nd Egyptian to test positive for the deadly disease,
health officials said on Fri 16 Feb 2007. A World Health Organisation
expert said a delay in reporting symptoms was largely behind the most
recent deaths in Egypt. A mutated strain that killed 3 people in
December [2006] is not suspected to have recurred, officials say.
The 37-year-old woman who died, had been reported in a stable and
improving condition after being transferred to a hospital in Cairo,
but her condition later deteriorated. "She died yesterday evening,"
[Thu 15 Feb 2007] said Amr Qandil, director of communicable diseases
at the Egyptian Health Ministry.
The 5-year-old boy was in stable condition and being treated with
Tamiflu. He tested positive for bird flu after developing a high
fever on Wed 14 Feb 2007, a health ministry statement said. Egypt has
the highest known cluster of human bird flu cases outside Asia, with
21 [now 22] known human cases since the virus 1st surfaced in
Egyptian poultry a year ago [2006]. Thirteen [people] have died.
The woman, who kept birds at her home, was admitted to hospital on 12
Feb 2007, after coming into contact with infected poultry. She was
from Fayoum, the same province where a 17-year-old girl died of bird
flu earlier this month [February 2007]. Most people infected in Egypt
had been in contact with poultry kept at home. John Jabbour, a WHO
official in Cairo, said a delay in reporting symptoms was making bird
flu more deadly in Egypt, where many people keep birds at home but
are often reluctant to disclose that to health officials for fear of
sanctions.
The fatality rate from bird flu this winter is significantly higher
than it was between March and May 2006, before the country witnessed
a 5-month warm-weather lull in human cases. Just 6 died of 14 people
who contracted bird flu in Egypt between March 2006 -- when the virus
1st surfaced in humans in the country -- and May [2006] when human
cases briefly disappeared.
Since the disease reappeared in humans in Egypt in October 2006, 8
Egyptians have contracted bird flu. Seven have died, including 3 [who
had contracted infection with a virus] with a mutation that made the
disease "moderately" resistant to Tamiflu.
Jabbour said the woman had noticed symptoms on 7 Feb 2007 but did not
enter hospital until 5 days later. "They are not reporting very
quickly. They are denying exposure," Jabbour told Reuters, saying
that meant the start of treatment was dangerously delayed. "This is
what is creating this problem here, the fatal condition of the
influenza virus in Egypt." Officials have said the 17-year-old
infected earlier this month [February 2007] also died largely because
she did not get treatment early enough. She was initially treated for
seasonal flu after her family denied she had come into contact with
sick birds.
