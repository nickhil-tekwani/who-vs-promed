South Africa's nascent guava industry is fighting off a killer disease that has hit the northern part of the country. Out of the 45 000 metric tons of guava produced annually, about 1/3rd is grown in the Western Cape, where Fan Reteif is the main cultivar, with the rest grown in the northern provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga.

However, the northern areas are currently battling guava wilt disease, which has wiped out nearly 30 percent of the trees in this part of the country.

A Nelspruit farmer describes the disease as having a "devastating" affect on the area. He explains that one of his blocks, which has 2500 trees, has fallen victim to the infection. "At this rate, about 2 years from now, I don't think there will be any trees left in that block," he says.

Agricultural Research Council's (ARC) Maritha Schoeman explains that Northern farmers originally grew Fan Retief but that this cultivar fell prey to guava wilt in 1981. ARC introduced a resistant cultivar in 1995 called TS G2, which also became susceptible when the disease mutated in 1999.

Schoeman has tested 15 fungicides so far but with no luck. She pins more hope on grafting a resistant cultivar but says this is a long-term process with no promise of success. She explains that guava wilt occurs in many areas.

In the meantime, farmers are trying to plant new trees in an attempt to get production out of them before they inevitably become infected. They are likely to convert to [other crops] if a resistant cultivar is not discovered soon and believe, if guava wilt persists, there will be a huge decline in the industry.

[Soil-borne wilt of guava has been associated with a number of fungal pathogens including _Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp. _psidii_, _F. solani_, _F. longipes_, _Myxosporium psidii_, _Myxosporium psidii-guajavae_, _Gibberella fujikuroi_, _Macrophomina phaseolina_, _Clonostachys rosea_, _Verticillium albo-atrum_ and _Rhizoctonia_ species. Spiral (_Helicotylenchus dihystera_) and root-knot (_Meloidogyne_ species) nematodes may also be involved in disease development. Different species have been reported from wilt-affected guava plants in different areas. A "slow" and a "quick" form of wilt are reported, which may be due to different pathogen combinations.

Guava wilt is spreading and is now considered the most important disease of this crop in many areas. The disease leads to decline and eventual death of the tree and is often more severe in plants subjected to other stress factors. Heavy yield losses of up to 70 percent and tree mortality of up to 100 percent have been recorded. Most of the fungi are soil-borne and may also be spread with infected plant material and by mechanical means.

Disease management may include cultural practices (removal of infected trees, soil solarisation) and fungicides, but, as in the report above, may not be effective for all pathogen combinations. Biological control methods are being investigated. Severity of wilt symptoms varies in different guava cultivars, but disease resistance of varieties may break down, as described above for cultivar Fan Retief.
