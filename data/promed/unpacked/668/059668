[This outbreak fulfills the criteria for a 'Champ maudit' or cursed field where previous outbreaks had occurred. In 2016, an intense episode of anthrax hit Moselle. A total of 8 outbreaks were detected in the Sarrebourg sector [in the Langatte commune]. An animal vaccination campaign was carried out in 15 communes to protect the farms [see 8 Jul 2017 Anthrax - France (02): (Moselle) bovine 20170708.5160530]. The reports do not say how the contaminated carcasses were disposed of. While it is far better to burn them, they do get buried. And these anthrax cattle graves can be a source of spores moving to the surface. Spores are hydrophobic and will float up when it rains.

My good friend Antonio Fasanella instructed me in how to recognize a cattle grave. Because cattle carcasses are bloated at the time of burial, the soil column above the carcass will drop as the carcass decomposes. This produces a mildly sunken area, say 1+ m by 2+ m [3+ ft by 6+ ft], which is best seen just after rain as it will fill with rainwater, very different from the area around it. Take soil samples from this "grave" and you will find spores.

Immediate vaccination of the affected herd and neighbouring livestock will be very effective. The problem is making sure that this vaccination is repeated in the spring of the following years, for at least 5 years. But in the absence of new outbreaks (as the vaccination succeeds) folk start taking it for granted, procrastinating, and very soon the livestock are fully susceptible as the anthrax vaccine has an impact of only 9 months maximum.

Langatte is in the northeast corner of France, close to the border with Germany; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langatte. The OIE site has a good map. - Mod.MHJ
