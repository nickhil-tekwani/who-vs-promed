A case of measles has been confirmed in Snohomish County, Washington, with a potential exposure reported at Seattle Children's Hospital, according to a 21 Feb [2022] health department news release.

The measles infection is in an infant living in Snohomish County. The infant is thought to have been infected during travel in South Asia before arriving in Washington. Before the infant was diagnosed, others may have been exposed at the Seattle-Tacoma Airport and at Seattle Children's Hospital. The potential exposure at the hospital occurred in the emergency room lobby 20 Feb [2022].

Health officials have been contacting affected locations to alert them of potential exposures. The health department is urging anyone who was potentially exposed to immediately get the measles vaccine if not yet immunized. Most people in the area have immunity to the measles via vaccination, so risk to the general public is low, according to the health department.

"Seattle Children's Emergency Department staff members followed appropriate screening processes of the patient and their family members at the visit and immediately implemented appropriate infection-control procedures, which include isolating the patient and reporting to King County Public Health," a hospital spokesperson told Becker's. The organization also notified patients and families in the emergency department who may have been exposed and provided information about disease symptoms.

"Most of the exposed patients were vaccinated," the hospital spokesperson said. "Of those that were not, we provided either MMR vaccine (within 72 hours of exposure) or measles immunoglobulin (within 6 days of exposure)."

The hospital is not aware of any measles trends in the region at this time.

Date: Fri 29 Oct 2021

The Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS) today [29 Oct 2021] declared a measles outbreak in Kambia District. There have been a total of 3 confirmed cases from a cluster of suspected cases in Bamoi Luma in the district. The MoHS is working with the World Health Organization and other partners and has dispatched rapid response teams to conduct a detailed investigation of the outbreak and plan for a robust and timely response.

A measles outbreak is defined as 3 or more laboratory-confirmed cases in a community or district within a span of one month.

On 19 Oct 2021, the Kambia District Health Management Team (DHMT) was notified by the Bamoi Luma Community Health Centre (CHC) of 3 suspected cases of measles in children aged 3, 5, and 6, residents of Fullah Town and Guinea Park communities within the Bamoi Luma CHC catchment area. The district surveillance unit conducted preliminary investigations including active case search in the surrounding communities leading to the identification and detection of 12 additional suspected cases. Blood samples were collected from 7 of the suspected cases for confirmation at the Central Public Health Reference Laboratory (CPHRL) in Freetown on 21 Oct 2021; 3 of the samples tested positive for measles.

Measles is a serious but vaccine-preventable disease that is caused by a virus. When children are not vaccinated, the virus can spread quickly and cause severe illness, disability, and deaths. A safe, free, and effective vaccine is available to protect children against measles virus, with 2 doses given as part of the routine vaccination schedule in Sierra Leone (the 1st dose at 9 months and the 2nd at 15 months).

The Ministry of Health advises and encourages the public to get their children vaccinated against measles. Measles vaccination is available free of cost at all health facilities in the country.
