[As seen above in the past 6 days since the last update (27 Jan 2016) there have been a total of 3 newly confirmed cases, 2 fatalities and 1 recovery reported by the Saudi MOH. Two of the newly confirmed cases were from Makkah region (1 from Taif, 1 from Al Khurma) and the 3rd newly confirmed case was from Hafr Albatin (Ash Sharqiyah region or the Eastern Region).

I need to mention that the numbers of recoveries I've presented do not agree with the numbers currently on the MOH website. In this 6 day period, the MOH website mentioned 2 newly reported recoveries in their tally, but no information is provided for these cases. I have chosen to use the figures from the spreadsheet I have been maintaining on Saudi MOH reports.

Maps of Saudi Arabia showing the locations of above mentioned cases, deaths and recoveries can be found at the source URLs. The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at: http://www.healthmap.org/promed/p/131. - Mod.MPP]
