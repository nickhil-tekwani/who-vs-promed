An animal-rights group says a circus elephant performing in Baltimore
poses a health risk to the public because she has tested positive for
tuberculosis.

But Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus and government health
officials say the animal is not a threat because she does not have an
active form of the infectious disease, The Baltimore Sun reported
Thursday [7 Apr 2011].

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) calls for quarantining
elephants only if they have an active case of tuberculosis.

Elephant-to-human transmission of tuberculosis is a new field of
study, only officially confirmed in 2009 by a Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) study of an outbreak in Tennessee, when
tuberculosis was transmitted from an elephant to 9 workers at an
animal refuge.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals discovered last week the
42-year-old Asian elephant named Karen had a positive tuberculosis
blood test, Delcianna Winders, the group's director of captive animal
law enforcement, said.

Winders said she informed Baltimore animal control officials Monday
[4 Apr 2011] and was told the city would bar the circus from using
Karen. Later, Winders said, the city reversed itself and said the
animal could perform.

One of the authors of the CDC study said there was little risk to the
public. "If you're at a circus, you're at a great distance from the
elephants," said Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of
Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.
"You do not have genuinely prolonged contact with them. You're there
for 2 hours of the show. That sort of exposure should not put people
at risk.

"I would let my grandchildren attend," he said.

[The US has approximately 270 Asian elephants, of which 12 percent
are thought to be infected with _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. These
elephants are closely taken care of by humans, so there will always be
concern of disease transmission between humans and animals. But those
concerns must be addressed with scientific facts through education of
both people who work with elephants and the zoo or circus-going
audience.

The current USDA Guideline for the Control of Tuberculosis in
Elephants states that all captive elephants should be tested annually
by culture and by blood with the Elephant TB STAT-PAK Assay, a
serological test that detects antibodies to tuberculosis. Cultures are
collected by trunk wash, where 60 ml of sterile saline is squirted
into the elephants trunk. Then a sterile plastic bag is held over the
end of the trunk for the elephant to exhale into the bag. Collect 20
ml of the sample in a sterile container and send to a certified lab
for culture analysis.

Elephants that have had _M. tuberculosis_ complex isolated from any
sample (sputum, stool, tissue, etc.) are considered as culture
positive for TB. The current USDA regulation would only quarantine
tuberculosis in elephants that have a positive culture for _M.
tuberculosis_
(http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_welfare/downloads/elephant/elephant_tb.pdf).

As quoted in this news item, Dr. William Schaffner, co-researcher of
the CDC report Elephant-to-Human Transmission of Tuberculosis, has
confirmed that elephants in a circus are at a great distance from and
would not be able to transmit tuberculosis to the public.

Also, note that the circumstances in the CDC report are different in
that the elephant had an active form of tuberculosis. The management
practice at this elephant sanctuary was daily high pressure water
spray cleaning of the elephant barn area, which resulted in
aerosolization which lasted for hours. But the circus elephant in this
news item has latent tuberculosis, not active. The elephant would be
on public display during the show for less than 2 hours, and there
would be no aerosolization or close contact of the elephant with the
circus audience. Therefore, under the USDA guideline, the circus
elephant should be deemed safe from transmitting tuberculosis to the
public and permitted to continue with the circus
(http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/17/3/pdfs/366.pdf).
