More than 23 000 cases of measles including 6 deaths were reported in France between 1 Jan 2008 and 16 Jan 2013, according to data released by l'Institut de Veille Sanitaire (The Institute of Public Health). Measles virus, which is transmitted easily because of its persistence in the air and or on surfaces contaminated with nasopharyngeal secretions, continues to circulate throughout France with the greatest incidence observed in the southwest.

This highly contagious viral infection continues to claim lives in France, according to figures released by l'Institut de Veille Sanitaire. Approximately 14 966 cases were reported in 2011 and 6 deaths. Last year [2012], 859 cases were reported without a significant epidemic peak in the spring as might have been expected. Among these patients, there were 3 cases of encephalitis and 32 cases of severe pneumonia.

L'Institut de Veille Sanitaire calls for enhanced surveillance. France must continue to ensure that all those born after 1980 receive 2 doses of the MMR (mumps, measles and rubella) vaccine. As a member of the European Region of the World Health Organization, France has a commitment to eliminate measles and congenital rubella infection.

North-East health bosses have issued a measles alert after almost 50 cases of measles were confirmed in recent months. The Health Protection Agency [HPA] in the North-East described the outbreak as "very serious" and predicted that we are likely to see "many more cases" before the outbreak is over. Officials urged adults to check whether they and their children are protected by having 2 doses of the MMR vaccine.

46 confirmed cases have been reported in the North-East since the beginning of September last year [2012], with a further 50 suspected cases. This compares with a total of 18 confirmed cases in 2011. The majority of cases are in unvaccinated school children and young adults with more than half of the cases aged between 10 and 30 years. Worryingly, a quarter of cases have needed hospital treatment.

Julia Waller, from the North-East HPA, said: "The sad thing is that most, if not all, of these cases could have been avoided if people had been up to date with MMR vaccination. There are still too many children and young adults who were not vaccinated. Furthermore, if they become ill with measles, they could also be a risk to people who are not able to protect themselves such as babies who are too young to be vaccinated."

The HPA is advising people with symptoms to stay away from school or work until at least 4 days after a rash has appeared. They should also ring in advance before attending a GP surgery or hospital with a rash. Patients with symptoms should also avoid contact with pregnant women, people with weak immune systems, and young babies. The HPA pointed out that measles is potentially a very serious illness which can, rarely, be fatal. It is highly infectious and is spread through contact with an infected person or through coughs and sneezes. The illness begins with a fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. This is followed with a rash that starts on the face and upper neck and then spreads.

Parents in South Tyneside are being advised to have their children vaccinated because of an outbreak of measles.

The warning comes after recent figures from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) revealed 46 cases have been confirmed in the North East since September [2012]. A further 50 suspected cases have also been reported.

Health experts say the vast majority of people diagnosed or suspected of having measles had not been vaccinated against the illness. A total of 24 people have, so far, needed hospital treatment. Amanda Healy, South Tyneside's director of public health, said: "We are urging parents to make sure their children have had primary immunisations but, in particular, the MMR jab so they are protected from measles, mumps and rubella. "Vaccinations save lives and are one of the most effective measures to help people stay well."

Meanwhile, GPs, out of hours services, and hospitals have been notified of the outbreak. Julia Waller, immunisation lead for the HPA in the North East, said: "This measles outbreak is very serious, and we are likely to see many more cases. The sad thing is most, if not all of cases could have been avoided if people were up to date with vaccination. The MMR vaccination is the combined vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella. The vaccine was introduced in 1988, but some parents refused to allow their children to have the triple vaccine. Since then, the number of children who develop these conditions has fallen, but the current figures represent a sharp rise on last year [2012].

http://premiumtimesng.com/news/116418-kebbi-records-93-more-cases-of-measles-in-rural-areas.htm


Nigeria has one of the highest case [numbers] of children unvaccinated against measles, reflective of the World Health Organisation's [WHO] report that Nigeria has over 9 per cent of children worldwide who are unvaccinated against measles. Health authorities in Birnin Kebbi Local Government Area and Zauro development areas of Kebbi State uncovered 93 fresh cases of measles in remote communities.

The Director of Health in the area, Yusuf Sani, said this in an interview in Birnin Kebbi on Tuesday [22 Jan 2013]. Mr. Sani said that fresh cases were uncovered in 13 remote settlements, including Bori, Anguwar Kayi, Dukko, Kalango, Anguwar Ali modu and Burga. Other settlements affected are Sabuwa, Gargariya, Akwara, Angwar Gero and Takalafiya in Fadama Zauro development area. 37 cases of measles had earlier been uncovered with 5 deaths recorded. Mr. Sani, however, said the victims had been treated, while preventive drugs, [and treatment had also been] provided for 300 children that had not been infected.

"Out of the 93 fresh cases uncovered, no deaths had been recorded, but efforts would be made to ensure that the scattered locations of the settlements were reached and medication provided," the director further stated. He said health officials would ensure that severe cases were isolated for effective monitoring and cure to prevent spread. "We would work closely with national and international health organisations to contain the spread of the disease that had emerged a month ago," the health director said. "We would enlighten parents on the relevance for preventive measures and prompt treatment to avoid spread of the airborne disease."

The WHO had last Thursday in a report, announced that 9 per cent of 20 million children who had not receive the 1st dose of vaccine against measles in 2011 are Nigerian children. WHO further stated 1.7 million Nigerian children did not receive the 1st dose of the vaccine in 2011. The organisation recommends that every child should receive 2 doses of measles vaccine.

One other measles patient was admitted in Holy Family Hospital (HFH) bringing the total number of measles patients in Rawalpindi to 23. The latest victim is said to be a 16-year-old resident of Dhoke Kala Khan. She was bought into the emergency ward of the Holy Family Hospital late Friday night [18 Jan 2013] with high fever. After medical aid, it was diagnosed that she had measles. According to doctors, medical care is being provided to her, and she is in stable condition. District Health officer Khalid Randwah [stated] that this is the 23rd case of measles which has come forward in Rawalpindi. He said so far, 22 patients have been treated and sent home. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 300 children have died from measles in Pakistan in 2012, a 5-fold increase from 2011.

Meanwhile, the absence of doctors at the emergency ward of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), one of the largest hospitals of the capital city, depicts the sorry state of this mega hospital. Sick patients, the elderly and children are made to wait for several hours before a doctor becomes available to see them at the emergency ward. Attendants complained that there are only 2 or 3 doctors working the entire ward due to which sick patients have to wait for a long time before they get any treatment. It has been learned that most of the doctors are on extended leave, [and as a result], there is a shortage of staff at the emergency ward. The patients complained that some of them are suffering from chest infections, asthma, heart disease, and some are elderly, due to which they are unable to stand in long queues, but the PIMS administration is oblivious to their sufferings. Meanwhile, they demanded that the concerned authorities pay greater attention to this grave issue so that the masses could get some relief.

92 cases of measles have been confirmed in Lahore, according to the Health Department. A 10-year-old died of measles at Mayo Hospital's paediatric ward on Wednesday [23 Jan 2013], doctors said, becoming the 1st casualty of the disease in the city. The child was brought to the hospital on Tuesday [22 Jan 2013] night and had developed pneumonia. Another 10 children with measles were also admitted to Mayo Hospital.

"They are being kept in isolation, as measles is a droplet infection, meaning it is highly contagious. If a child with measles is kept in the ward with other children, there is a 90 per cent chance all of them will catch measles," said a doctor at the paediatric ward. "We may also face problems in accommodating all the children in isolation due to space issues."

A Health Department official said that 12 children infected with measles had been admitted to other public hospitals in Lahore, taking the total number of known cases in the city to 92. Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif on Wednesday [23 Jan 2013] expressed concern about the rising number of measles cases and directed the Health Department to prepare an emergency plan within 2 days for the prevention of measles. He directed officials to make sure that anti-measles vaccine is available in the province and to launch a public awareness campaign regarding preventive measures. Children in the affected areas must be vaccinated, he said at a meeting with Health Department officials.

Special Assistant on Health Khawaja Salman Rafique, the Planning and Development chairman for the Health, Law, Prosecution and Home secretaries, the acting inspector general of police, the Lahore commissioner, the Gujranwala commissioner, the Lahore DCO, the Health director general, the director general of the Forensic Science Laboratory, and Dr Faisal Masood also attended the meeting.

40 cases of measles have been reported in Multan, and 3 children are currently under treatment, but there have been no deaths from the disease, according to EDO (Health) Dr Munawar. He said vaccination teams had been set up to inoculate children in affected areas. He said that the disease had arrived in the district from Sindh [province], where some 200 children are thought to have died in a recent outbreak.

Six new measles patients were reported in Gujranwala on Wednesday [23 Jan 2013]. Health officials said the children were being treated at the Civil Hospital. Health Director General Dr Nisar Cheema said the number of measles patients being reported in the Punjab was far less than [in] Sindh, and the outbreak had not yet become an epidemic in the province. He said that more cases of measles had been reported in the Punjab in previous years than in this year [2013] so far.

A paediatrician who attended the meeting said that senior paediatricians would make a plan to guide doctors on how to treat the disease. He said the disease was particularly dangerous for children suffering from malnutrition. "Not many children who get measles die of it. Usually, it is that they get pneumonia, which can be fatal," he said. "Those suffering from the disease should be given vitamin A, besides usual clinical treatment." He said that the guidelines would be finalised by Tuesday [22 Jan 2013] and circulated to all executive district officers for health in the Punjab.

In a statement, Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif said that he had sought a report on the disease situation from Special Assistant to the Chief Minister for Health Khawaja Salman Rafique. Talking to reporters after the meeting, Rafique said that the Punjab was better prepared to handle a measles outbreak than Sindh, where hundreds are thought to have died of the disease. Rafique said that 1476 measles cases had been reported during the current year in the Punjab, whereas there had been 7 suspected deaths: 5 in Rajanpur and one each in Gujranwala and Kasur.

He said that the Punjab government had taken steps to ensure medical care of measles patients and to stop the spread of the disease. He said "mop-up" campaigns were being carried out in the affected areas, in accordance with World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines, to vaccinate children aged 6 months to 10 years.

Rafique said that a social mobilisation campaign would be carried out through the media to inform parents about the importance of vaccinations. At the district level, DCOs were in charge of surveillance of the disease, vaccinations and monitoring of case reporting. He said that the Health Department had more than 1.2 million anti-measles doses in stock, while 2 million more were being procured through UNICEF, for which a payment of Rs 243.7 million [USD 4.5 million] had been made. He said that the purchased vaccines would arrive within 2 weeks.

The meeting was attended by Health Secretary Arif Nadeem, Health Director General Dr Nisar Ahmed Cheema, Expanded Programme of Immunisation Director Dr Tanvir Hussain, Dr Babar Alam of WHO, Mushtaq Rana of UNICEF, Prof Tahir Masood of the Institute of Child Health and Children's Hospital, paediatrician Dr Ashraf Sultan, and Dr Akhtar Rashid Malik, provincial coordinator of the Lady Health Worker Programme.

The Health Department has decided to lower the age at which children get their 1st measles vaccination from 9 months to 6 months in areas where cases of the disease are being reported. In a meeting here on Monday [21 Jan 2013] to review the situation in the province, authorities also decided to launch an awareness campaign urging parents to get their children vaccinated and to make a set of guidelines for measles treatment, participants of the meeting told The Express Tribune.

Currently, the 1st vaccine injection against measles is administered to children at the age of 9 months. Additional Director General for Vector Borne Diseases Dr Jaffar Ilyas, who attended the meeting, said that it had been decided that in all localities where measles cases were being reported, children would be administered the 1st [dose] at the age of 6 months. They will get the next shot after a year or so. "In routine practice, the 2nd shot is administered at the age of 15 months," he said.

A paediatrician who attended the meeting said that senior paediatricians would make a plan to guide doctors on how to treat the disease. He said the disease was particularly dangerous for children suffering from malnutrition. "Not many children who get measles die of it.

http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/breaking-news/pakistan-records-103-child-measles-deaths/story-e6freuz9-1226560516976


More than 100 children have died of measles in Pakistan this month, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday [23 Jan 2013], calling it "an alarming outbreak." "Some 103 Pakistani children have died from 1-19 Jan 2013 this year because of post-measles complications such as pneumonia, post-measles encephalitis and diarrhoea," WHO spokeswoman Maryam Yunus told AFP [Agence France Presse]. 63 of the cases occurred in the southern province of Sindh, which was hit by severe flooding in 2010, 2011 and 2012. More than 300 Pakistani children died of measles in 2012, a staggering increase on the previous 12 months and a result of 3 consecutive years of flooding, officials said. WHO said 64 children died of measles in Pakistan in 2011, 28 of them in Sindh. It was not immediately able to provide statistics for earlier years.

The WHO said most of the cases occurred between October and December [2012] in northern parts of Sindh but was unable to provide a breakdown. The UN body said 33 children died in southwestern Baluchistan province, which is plagued by separatist insurgency and sectarian strife. The most populous Punjab province reported 7 children's deaths. Half of a total of 2447 cases were reported from Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital. "It is certainly an alarming situation. ... It is an outbreak," said a WHO spokesperson. She said WHO and UNICEF provided a combined 4.4 million doses of measles vaccines since last year [2012] to target the children in Sindh's flood-affected areas. A senior health ministry official confirmed the WHO figures. "We can't dispute the figures. Our own teams have similar reports," he said. "Something must have gone wrong. ... We are weighing where have we gone wrong," he said. The WHO spokeswoman said a key factor behind more deaths in Sindh was malnourishment, particularly in the flood-affected districts. A ministry official said the number of deaths in January 2013 are already at "a record high."

The death toll from the nearly 2-month-old measles outbreak has reached 485 according to unofficial statistics, yet there are parts of Sindh where the vaccine has yet to reach.

During a meeting on Tuesday [22 Jan 2013] night at Sukkur circuit house, adviser to chief minister on relief Halim Adil Shaikh told The Express Tribune that there are some desert belts of Sukkur where the vaccinators have not reached. The health workers have been allocated 4-wheelers and have nearly Rs 3.4 million [USD 34 800] at their disposal, but their performance has been very poor, he felt.

Shaikh met the residents of several villages in Salehpat taluka and even some parts of Khairpur district, who told him that no vaccinators have visited them. The residents of Bagan Shambhani village complained that they are hardly one km away from the main road, but they were missed. The situation in health centres is also poor, as there is a shortage of doctors and paramedics, the adviser said. The authorities are to blame for not recording the actual number of deaths from measles, Shaikh said. 11 children have died in Sarohi village alone, he pointed out.

According to Shaikh, several children who were brought into Civil Hospital, Sukkur, and Red Crescent Hospital contracted measles even though they were vaccinated. This is quite alarming because it means that the vaccines are not kept cold when they are transported from one location to another, he said.

A father lost his 2-year-old son on Wednesday [23 Jan 2013] morning at Red Crescent Hospital even though he was vaccinated. The family lives in Arain village near Sukkur, where the child was vaccinated a few weeks ago. Some time later, the boy showed symptoms of measles, and the doctors advised the family to take him to Sukkur, but the little boy could not make it.

A resident of Budho Chohan village, which is around 10 km from Sukkur, told The Express Tribune that his 2-year-old son was vaccinated one month ago, but he contracted the virus 5 days ago. Similarly, the daughter of a resident of Shikarpur was vaccinated 3 weeks ago, but she also contracted the virus. Others claimed that 5 children have died from measles in their village in the past one month. There are several patients in Civil Hospital who were earlier vaccinated but are still suffering from measles.

Sukkur district health officer Dr Jay Ram Das confirmed that it is possible to contract the virus even after vaccination. "It depends upon the immune system of the child," he told The Express Tribune. The success rate of the anti-measles vaccine is not more than 85 per cent, he added. Sometimes, children's immune systems do not accept the vaccine, and they fall prey to the virus. In these cases, Dr Das said, they give vitamin A drops to the children, besides taking extra post-measles care so that they are safe from further complications.

The State of Sao Paulo (SP) has had no endemic circulation of measles virus since 2000. However, in 2011, there were 27 measles cases, with 18 of them occurring as 2 outbreaks in schools. The 1st cases in 2011 occurred in late January 2011 with a history of travel to Florida, USA. Most cases (n=23) in SP occurred between August and December 2011, with the last case exhibiting the characteristic rash on 25 Dec 2011. There was no record of any confirmed cases of measles in SP during 2012.

On Wed 2 Jan 2013, a suspected case of measles in a 20-year-old resident of the city of Bauru (SP state) with a history of international travel to Florida, USA in December 2012 tested positive for measles virus genotype D8 by RT-PCR and sequencing performed at Fiocruzon on the initial sample (2 Jan 2013). Measles virus genotype D8 is circulating in England and has been detected in other countries, including the USA, Canada and China. On Wed 9 Jan 2013, a traveler living in Minas Gerais, who returned on the same flight, presented with rash and fever. On Thu 10 Jan 2013, 2 family contacts who had accompanied the 1st case also became symptomatic. All cases are under investigation until the final diagnosis.

Sao Paulo state is characterised by heavy daily international, interstate and intrastate traffic. In a few weeks will begin the return from summer vacation and the start of classes. Thus, it is important that everyone keep their vaccination status updated according to the state immunization schedule, especially professionals in the health sector, education and tourism.

Vaccination coverage in the State of Sao Paulo for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination in 2012 (provisional data up to 19 Dec 2012) is 99.8 percent (68 percent homogeneity). Vaccination coverage in GVE XV Bauru is 104 percent (71 percent homogeneity). Vaccination coverage in Bauru is 111 percent [Reported vaccination coverages of over 100 percent are explained by either underestimates of the denominator (population estimates), or vaccination of more individuals than should have been, either people coming from outside of the vaccination centers catchment area or vaccinating outside of the recommended age range, or mismanagement of records. According to Teixeira and Rocha, homogeneity of vaccination coverages is defined as the proportion of municipalities with vaccination coverages equal or greater than 95 percent (see Teixeira AMS, Rocha CMV. Vigilancia das coberturas de vacinacao: uma metodologia para deteccao e intervencao em situacoes de risco. Epidemiologia e Servicos de Saude 2010;19(3):217-226. available at: http://portal.saude.gov.br/portal/arquivos/pdf/vigilancia_coberturas_vacinais_antonia.pdf in Portuguese). - Mod.MPP].

The CV Rubella Vaccination Campaign that was held in 2008 for people between 20 and 39 years of age in SP state was 94.6 percent (56 percent homogeneity) and for GVE in Bauru was 87.5 percent (homogeneity 50 percent). In the city of Bauru, it was 79 percent.

The 1st dose of MMR vaccine is applied at 12 months with a 2nd dose between 4 and 6 years old. Importantly, the 1st dose applied at 12 months old is considered sufficient. A 2nd dose is recommended for people 19 years of age. For unvaccinated adults, the MMR vaccine is recommended for those born after 1960.

A case of measles, a highly contagious and rare illness, has been reported out of Marion County.

Public health officials reported that someone who had traveled internationally started to exhibit symptoms and was diagnosed on Wednesday [23 Jan 2013] at Doernbecher Children's Hospital. The person has been infectious since 18 Jan 2013, officials said.

Health experts say more than 95 percent of people living in the Pacific Northwest have been vaccinated and are immune to measles. Still, because measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease and a potentially serious infection, health officials want the public to be on alert for symptoms. Specifically, officials say people who were at the locations below at these times are susceptible to contracting the illness:

- Marshall's store at Keizer Station, 6365 Ulali Dr. N.E., between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. on 20 Jan 2013.
- Target, 6450 Keizer Station Blvd. N.E., between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. on 20 Jan 2013.
- Walgreen's, 4380 Commercial St. S.E. in Salem, between 2:30 p.m. and 5 p.m. on 22 Jan 2013.
- OHSU Doernbecher Children's Hospital main lobby and 7th floor clinics, between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. on 23 Jan 2013.

Folks living in Marion County wishing to get vaccinated for measles should contact their medical provider or the Marion County Health Department at 503-584-4870.

Because most people in our area have immunity to measles through vaccination, the risk to the general public is low. But people who were at Sea-Tac Airport around the same time as a contagious traveler should be aware of their measles immunity status and call a health care provider promptly if they develop an illness with fever or an unexplained rash illness before 9 Feb 2013. People at highest risk from exposure to measles include those who are unvaccinated, pregnant women, infants under 6 months of age, and those with weakened immune systems.

The contagious traveler flew from Amsterdam to Portland, Oregon through a connecting flight in Seattle on 18 Jan 2013. Persons who were in one of the following areas at Sea-Tac Airport between 11:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. on 18 Jan 2013 were possibly exposed to measles:

- S Gate
- South Train
- Main Terminal South Station
- Train between South and North Station
- Main Terminal North Station
- North Train
- N Gate

After arriving in Oregon, the traveler received medical attention and was diagnosed on 23 Jan 2013, and determined to be infectious beginning on 18 Jan 2013. Health authorities in Oregon, Washington, and at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were notified. The CDC is following up to notify those on the same flights as the contagious traveler.

Measles, also known as rubeola, is a highly contagious and usually severe illness that causes fever, rash, cough, and red, watery eyes. The rash begins on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Fever (often greater than 101 F), cough and other symptoms begin 2 to 4 days before the rash appears. Measles symptoms begin 7 to 21 days after the exposure to measles occurred. Measles is contagious from approximately 4 days before the rash appears through 4 days after the rash appears. People can spread measles before they have the characteristic measles rash.

All international travelers are routinely recommended to have 2 doses of measles vaccine before travel.
