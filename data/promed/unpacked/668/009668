Monthly Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Statistics; As of Mon 2 Feb 2004
--------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health issued on Mon 2 Feb 2004 the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease. This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as (vCJD) or CJD (new var.)] -- the form
of the disease thought to be linked to bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE). The position is as follows:
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK:
Referrals of suspect CJD/ Deaths of definite and probable CJD
Year/ Referrals/ Sporadic/ Iatrogenic/ Familial/ GSS/ vCJD/ Total deaths
1990/ 53/ 28/ 5/ 0/ 0/ -/ 33
1991/ 75/ 32/ 1/ 3/ 0/ -/ 36

2004*/ 9/ 1/ 0/ 0/ 0/ 0/ 0/ 1
Total/1808/692/44/40/21/139/936
(*Provisional as of Mon 2 Feb 2004)
Summary of vCJD cases
---------------------
Deaths:
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 103
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 35
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 1
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 139
Alive:
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 7
Total number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 146
The precise definitions of the terms: Referrals, Deaths, Definite
cases, Probable vCJD cases, Sporadic, Probable sporadic, Iatrogenic,
Familial, GSS, variant CJD, and the case definitions can be found by
accessing the Department of Health web-site or by reference to a
preceding ProMED-mail post in this thread [CJD (new var.) - UK:
update Mar 2002 20020305.3693].
The next monthly statistics will be published on Mon 1 Mar 2004.

[Since the previous monthly statistics released by the Department of
Health on Mon 5 Jan 2004, the total number of definite or probable
vCJD cases (dead and alive) has increased by one, whereas the number
of deaths remains unchanged. Consequently, the number of probable
vCJD cases still alive has increased by one. - Mod.CP]
[In view of the experimental evidence from transmission experiments
in mice reported by Asante et al. (MRC Prion Unit, University
College, London) in the EMBO Journal, Vol. 21, No. 23, 6358-6368,
2002, that: "Some patients with a phenotype consistent with sporadic
CJD may have a disease arising from BSE exposure" (see: CJD, possible
association with BSE 20021129.5921), the figures for sporadic CJD
cases now have added significance in relation to the course of the
vCJD outbreak and will continued to be presented here.
<http://emboj.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/21/23/6358?etoc>
vCJD has been recognized to date only in individuals homozygous for
methionine at PRNP codon 129, and Asante et al. reported that
transgenic mice expressing human PrP methionine 129, inoculated with
either bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or variant CJD prions,
may develop the neuropathological and molecular phenotype of vCJD,
consistent with these diseases being caused by the same prion strain.
However, BSE transmission to these transgenic mice, in addition to
producing a vCJD-like phenotype, also resulted in a distinct
molecular phenotype that was indistinguishable from that of sporadic
CJD with PrP\Sc type 2. These data suggest that more than one
BSE-derived prion strain might infect humans; it is therefore
possible that some patients with a phenotype consistent with sporadic
CJD may have a disease arising from BSE exposure.
Since Mon 5 Jan 2004 the number of deaths attributed to sporadic CJD
remains unchanged, although one death was recorded during Jan 2004.
The overall total remains the same because in the 2003 cohort one
case of sporadic CJD was reclassified as familial CJD. - Mod.CP]

Mad Cow Disease: Linked to Thousands of CJD cases?
--------------------------------------------------
In the US, the government's monitoring system for cases of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a fatal human brain illness, could
be missing tens of thousands of victims, scientists and consumer
advocates have told United Press International. Clusters of CJD have
been reported in various areas of the United States -- Pennsylvania
in 1993, Florida in 1994, Oregon in 1996, New York in 1999-2000, and
Texas in 1996.
People who develop CJD from eating mad-cow-contaminated beef have
been thought to develop a specific form of the disorder called
variant CJD. But new research (see reference at the end of part [1]
above) indicates the mad cow pathogen can cause both sporadic CJD and
the variant form. "Now people are beginning to realize that because
something looks like sporadic CJD they can't necessarily conclude
that it's not linked to (mad cow disease)," said Laura Manuelidis,
Section Chief of Surgery in the Neuropathology Department at Yale
University, who conducted a 1989 study that found 13 percent of
Alzheimer's patients actually had CJD. Several studies, including the
one by Manuelidis, have found autopsies reveal 3-13 percent of
patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's or dementia actually suffered
from CJD. Those numbers might sound low, but there are 4 million
Alzheimer's cases and hundreds of thousands of dementia cases in the
United States. A small percentage of those cases could add up to 120
000 or more CJD victims going undetected and not included in official
statistics.
At the same time autopsies have been declining, the number of deaths
attributed to Alzheimer's has increased more than 50-fold since 1979,
going from 857 deaths then to nearly 50 000 in 2000. Though it is
unlikely that the dramatic increase in Alzheimer's is due entirely to
misdiagnosed CJD cases, it "could explain some of the increase we've
seen," Manuelidis said.
