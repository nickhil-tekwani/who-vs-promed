Summary
-------
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread worldwide. Previous studies suggested cat could be a potential susceptible animal of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we investigated the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in cats by detecting specific serum antibodies. A cohort of serum samples were collected from cats in Wuhan, including 102 sampled after COVID-19 outbreak and 39 prior to the outbreak. A total of 15 of 102 (14.7%) cat sera collected after the outbreak were positive for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Among the positive samples, 11 had SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies with a titer ranging from 1/20 to 1/1080. No serological cross-reactivity was detected between the SARS-CoV-2 and type I or II feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV).

Our data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 has infected the cat population in Wuhan during the outbreak.

[Of the 15 ELISA-positive cats, 3 were home-kept (owned by COVID-19 patients); they presented the highest neutralization titers. The other 12 cats came from pet hospitals or were stray cats -- 6 each. No information on clinical signs in any of the tested cats is included.

These results are in agreement with earlier reports on 2 PCR-positive cats that had been exposed to their COVID-19-infected owners: one from Belgium (with mild clinical signs, see 20200327.7151215) and the other one from Hong Kong (without clinical signs, 20200402.7173286). The current report is also in agreement with the results of an experimental infection trial, undertaken by HVRI (Harbin, China), which revealed that SARS-CoV-2 will infect cats both by inoculation as well as by contact with infected cats (item 2 in the said posting).

The possible role of cats in the epidemiology of COVID-19 is yet to be further studied; their infection could rather present a case of anthropozoonosis. This, obviously, does not preclude the need to prevent exposure of humans to infected cats or other pets. Excrements from infected stray cats may, at least theoretically, contribute to environmental contamination (for example, Wuhan's seafood market?).

OIE's Q&A on COVID-19 in animals was updated 1 Apr 2020; see at https://www.oie.int/en/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus/.

So far, Hong Kong (SAR-PRC) officially reported 3 cases of COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) in pets (2 dogs, one cat), as "emerging disease", to the OIE:

The Belgian infected cat was reported to the OIE in a written report available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Our_scientific_expertise/docs/pdf/COV-19/Belgium_28.03.20.pdf.

The 4th call of OIE's ad hoc Group "COVID-19 the human-animal interface" was held on 31 Mar 2020. The meeting's notes are available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Our_scientific_expertise/docs/pdf/COV-19/4th_call_OIE_informal_advisory_group_on_COVID19_and_animals.pdf.

The notes include, among other information, the following:

1. In the USA, a research institute is planning on doing experimental infection studies in brown bats (which have a long range) to address the research question, "If humans introduce SARS-CoV-2 infections into brown bats, could they become a reservoir?"

2. The OIE project "EBO-SURSY" is proposing to test 3000 samples already collected from bats for haemorrhagic fever virus surveillance in West Africa for the presence of coronavirus to assess whether precursor viruses to SARS-CoV-2 have been circulating.

3. In China, animals from fur farms (including mink, foxes, raccoon dogs) have been tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. So far all have been negative.

4. In North America, huge investment (time and resources) has gone into captive breeding (with a view to reintroduction) of the endangered black-footed ferret. Infectious disease, including canine distemper, has already been a huge set back to the programme. The programme is already implementing strict biosecurity to avoid workers infecting the ferrets with SARS-CoV-2. This highlights the relevance of animal infection studies (of ferrets to conservation work). - Mod.AS
