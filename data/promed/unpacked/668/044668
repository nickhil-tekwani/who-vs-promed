First, for attributed information about the outbreak associated with the
Glastonbury festival, (and other interesting events) please visit the home
page of EuroSurveillance Weekly Bulletin at: http://www.eurosurv.org/main.htm
Second, my original "posting" had not been sent to the "promed" address for
posting, but to one of the moderators. I had hoped to have a dialogue with
the moderator before making a posting to stimulate a constructive debate
about the role of anonymous postings and the risks/benefits of posting
early rumours of outbreaks which might be under investigation.
Unfortunately this has not happened, this is an unfortunate
misunderstanding. I would be interested in learning what the procedures are
should one wish to contact the moderators.
Third, some comments were made which might bear further thinking about:
Jack Wedam drew out the advantages and disadvantages of anonymous postings
and made some sensible suggestions -- these may not be possible for all
countries but the principles seem right.
Andrew Thorn made some pertinent comments which I agree with -- the
consequence of those is that we should try to develop systems for
transmitting information which minimise the harm which might arise, whilst
maximising the benefit.
Joel Breman suggests that there should be guidelines for getting
information to national public health authorities early. This would be
beneficial -- but may put an onerous burden on the moderators. However it
should be possible to ask an authoritative source about an unattributed
rumour. I agree with the thanks he expresses to the moderators.
Fourth, I am uncertain where the notion came from that I was in favour of
repression of information. To quote my original words "I am an enthusiastic
supporter of ProMED[-mail and the ideal of open access to information,
however this has to be tempered with responsibility". Now may not be the
best time to put information in the public domain. I may not be the
appropriate person to put the information in the public domain.
Fifth, I made my motives quite clear -- they are that we all have
responsibilities to the public health that are not always best served by
placing this information in the public domain now. I think the UK can be
proud of its record in outbreak investigation and timely information to the
public (my opinion), nowhere is perfect and we all strive to improve.
Finally, there are some important issues here that cannot be swept away.
ProMED-mail subscribers have a responsibility to ask themselves if they should
be posting a message now. Is this message likely to serve a beneficial
public health outcome? The issue of guidelines for the posting of
unattributable messages should be debated constructively. The issue of
sending messages directly to the moderators should be clarified.

To respond point by point:
First, note that the official report was posted 8 days later than the
ProMED-mail report, and was reposted on ProMED-mail.
Second, when a person sends a letter to the editor of a journal or
newspaper regarding an article that was published, that person normally
hopes to see an edited version of that letter appear, unless s/he
specifically states it is not for publication. The same applies to a
moderated list like ProMED-mail.
Also, the original posting about the outbreak was NOT anonymous; the
contributor, who works for a UK health agency, requested that the name be
withheld.
Third, besides the comments quoted by Dr Weinberg, there have been
substantially more in favor of the idea that the overriding benefit to
public health comes from publication without delay (several more taking
this view, and only one more against it, have been received since the
compilation that was posted).
Fourth, there is a fine line between waiting for "the best time to put
information in the public domain" and repressing information.
Fifth, see "Third" and "Fourth" above.
Finally, I believe ProMED-mail subscribers send in information because they
think it is important for it to be disseminated. I know that the
moderators post information for that reason. Rest assured that we take our
responsibility seriously.

From: Peter_Cowen@ncsu.edu
I have just returned from 5 days in the UK last week, and I was
struck, long before I read these postings, on how clearly the broadcast
media had tied the _E. coli_ cases to the mud. There were many reports
hammering home the message that the disease came from the muddy cow pasture.
If anything were going to ruin a case control study, it was a barrage of
media
information linking disease to a particular causative entity, i.e. mud.
There is no evidence that the ProMED-mail posting was the origin of what
was broadcast on the airways.
