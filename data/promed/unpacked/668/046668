Dengue in Far North Queensland
------------------------------
Outbreak location
Thursday Island in the Torres Strait (about 1000km north of Cairns).
Date outbreak declared
2 March 2005
Number of cases
One confirmed case and 11 suspected cases.
Type of dengue
Dengue type 4
Maps illustrating the Dengue Warning Areas
Note: These maps illustrate the Dengue Warning Areas where dengue has
occurred within the last month
Thursday Island, Torres Strait Islands
Advice
Torres Strait and Northern Peninsula Area residents are urged to take
immediate steps to prevent dengue fever.
Queensland Health�s Tropical Public Health Unit says the outbreak of dengue
type 4 poses a serious health risk to anyone in the Torres who has had dengue
before. Anyone who acquires dengue more than once is at risk of developing
dengue haemorrhagic fever, which can be fatal.
To protect yourself from dengue fever, you should:
- get rid of mosquito breeding sites in homes and yards, especially pot plant
bases, tyres, and buckets used for striking plant cuttings
- use insect repellent � wear personal repellent during the day and
reapply it according to the label.
- use plug-in mosquito zappers,
- use cockroach surface spray under tables, chairs and beds in the
home.
Anyone who has any symptoms of dengue fever should see their health centre
immediately.

3 cases of type 4 dengue fever have been confirmed in the region and there
are at least 13 suspected cases. [The outbreak of type 2 dengue fever in
Townsville, north Australia, was officially declared over in the 1st week of
September 2004, after no new cases were reported for the previous 3 months;
see ref. (28) below. � Mod.JW]
3 Northern Territory government mosquito experts leave today to help a
Queensland health team contain the latest dengue fever outbreak in the Torres
Strait. 2 of them have practical experience with the mosquito eradication
team in Tennant Creek and one is a Darwin specialist in exotic insects.
The Department of Health's medical entomologist, Peter Whelan, says the first
week of their stay is the most important in the containment of the
outbreak. "Primarily that involves locating and treating anywhere where there
are these mosquitos and they're breeding," he said. "The most important
locations to tackle first are where the suspected cases and where the
confirmed cases are, that means that in that area will be probably infected
mosquitos."
Mr Whelan says it is very important to contain the outbreak on Thursday
Island as soon as possible. "First of all it's to stop the people on Thursday
Island from getting dengue," he said. �The other thing is that if these
people infected with the dengue virus travel to any of the other areas in
north Queensland or even into Tennant Creek, there's a chance
that they're taking the virus with them and then infect local mosquitos in
other towns like Cairns or Townsville."

As of 28 Feb 2005, WHO has received reports of 336 hospitalized cases of
dengue infection and 22 deaths. 263 of the 336 cases had clinical features
compatible with dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and the remaining 73 cases
were diagnosed as suspected dengue fever (DF) using WHO standard case
definitions. Districts reporting DF/DHF cases are Baucau, Dili, Ermera,
Liquica, Maliana, Manatuto and Viqueque, with 76% of the cases reported from
Dili (see previous report
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2005_02_15/en/>).
Preliminary laboratory results have identified dengue 3 as the main
circulating strain in this outbreak. The virologist from the National
Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), Japan, is working with the Central
Laboratory and the National Hospital, Dili, for further laboratory
investigations.
WHO and the WHO Collaborating Centre for Case Management of Dengue/Dengue
Haemorrhagic Fever, Thailand, Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child
Health provided on site support to the Ministry of Health and the National
Hospital, Dili for the clinical management of dengue patients.
In addition, WHO and the Ministry of Health conducted practical training
seminars on early diagnosis, referral procedures and clinical management to
doctors and nurses from Dili and other provinces. The case fatality rate at
the National Hospital, Dili, has dropped from 16.3% during the week of 5-21
Jan 2005 to 3.6% during the week of 12-24 February 2005.
The Ministry of Health, with support from WHO, NIID, and USAID are carrying
out vector control activities. Insecticide spraying has covered more than
2000 households in high-risk areas, and additional spraying and larval
control are underway in Dili and Baucau.
Health education activities are also being carried out to raise awareness of
the disease and the need for appropriate prevention and control measures.
The Ministry of Health has established an Emergency Action Task Force for
Dengue to coordinate all activities aimed at reducing the transmission and
fatalities from dengue infection. WHO is working with the Ministry of Health
on the long- and short-term strategy for dengue control in Timor-Leste. Other
partners in the Task Force are UN agencies, donors, international and
national nongovernmental organizations.

[263 cases of DHF out of 336 hospitalized cases (78 percent) is an
extraordinarily high rate. There must be thousands of mild cases and very
strict criteria for admission, understandable in a country with scarce health
resources. � Mod.JW]

Dengue fever outbreak reported in Hodeidah
------------------------------------------
Primary medical reports revealed that more than 20 cases of dengue fever have
been discovered in the district of Hodeidah. The number of suspected cases
reached 34, but 4 cases turned out to be malarial infection. 30 were examined
in Sana'a and appeared to have caught dengue fever. The media at large
reported 300 deaths from the disease.
Majed Al-Jonaid, deputy minister of health, emphasizes that a number of
people died in one district of Hodeidah but no new cases of the fever have
been reported since 16 Jan 2005. 34 people thought to have been afflicted
with dengue fever were not serious, although one girl who was in critical
condition was subsequently treated and recovered.
Al-Jonaid said that the Ministry of Public Health & Population is carrying
out a campaign in cooperation with the WHO to observe and control the disease
in Hodeidah and that this project will be extended to include all
governorates. In addition, the ministry will provide free medical services
and distribute protective mosquito nets to prevent further cases. He said
that awareness campaigns would form 90 percent of the battle to combat the
disease. Al-Jonaid said that local radio stations and the health campaign
vehicles with megaphones are carrying out the task. He also said that filling
up areas of mosquito proliferation with soil is one important method of
fighting the disease
Al-Jonaid indicated that it was not the first time this epidemic has occurred
in Yemen. Dengue fever appeared in Shabwa in November 2002 and in neighboring
countries such as Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia. Saudi Arabia announced cases of
the disease a month ago.
Dr. Hashim Al-Zein, representative of the WHO in Yemen, told the press most
of the suspected cases occurred in Hodeidah. It was prevalent in individuals
but not in groups. A WHO-assigned team is continuing its search for the
remaining cases as well as observing and controlling the proliferation of the
disease and the insects that carry it in areas where they have been found.

2 people died of dengue this month [Bebruary 2005] making the total number
of deaths due to the outbreak this year to 24 nationwide. Health Ministry's
Disease Control Division Director Dr Ramlee Rahmat said a 21-year-old man
died at Melaka Hospital on 6 Feb 2005 while the other was a 54-year-old-man
at Selayang Hospital on 16 Feb 2005. Speaking at the weekly press conference
on the dengue outbreak, here Thursday, he said the number of dengue cases
reported in the 7th week of this year rose by 124 to 1087 cases compared to
963 cases in the previous week. However, 4 states recorded lower dengue
cases: Negeri Sembilan, Sabah, Pahang & Labuan , he said. Selangor remained
as the state with the highest number of dengue cases with 427, followed by
Kuala Lumpur (172), Perak (125), Penang (63) and Johor (43).
Dr Ramlee said to control the outbreak, Health Departments in the states had
been directed to intensify continuous control and prevention efforts
especially in the states which recorded an increase in the dengue cases. He
also called on property developers to play a role in the efforts as the
number of construction sites found breeding mosquitoes was still high. In
Selangor alone, he said, out of 101 construction sites inspected in the 7th
week of the year, 69 were found breeding mosquitoes while in Kuala Lumpur, 27
of 34 construction sites were found breeding mosquitoes. He said the Health
Ministry had issued compound fines to 422 premises and ordered one premises
to close down.
