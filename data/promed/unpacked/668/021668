Mozambique moves to fight banana disease
----------------------------------------
Mozambique says plans are under way to roll out an ambitious 3 year plan to contain a deadly pathogenic form of the fusarium banana wilt. The project is expected to cost USD 370 000, with support of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

Recently, a destructive strain of the Panama disease [TR4; see ProMED-mail post 20131206.2095450] was discovered on a farm in the remote, agriculture-rich district of Monapo in the northern province of Nampula, after it devastated banana plantations in Asia over the past 2 decades. The Ministry of Agriculture says the authorities want to prevent it from spreading to new areas.

Panama disease strikes in East Java
-----------------------------------
The province Lumajang in East Java [Jawa Timur] ranks among the biggest banana production sites in Indonesia. Most of the bananas grown here are sold locally. Some farmers, however, have taken up small-scale commercial production of Cavendish and are not happy with their choice.

[Farmers] used to plant different banana cultivars, including the local plantains. In 2004, Panama disease attacked the plants. To circumvent further yield loss, the government encouraged farmers to start growing Cavendish bananas. The new commercial plantations were celebrated as an economic success.

But Panama disease struck again in 2012, on -- up to then -- resistant Cavendish cultivars. Since then, the farmers have tried different treatments, but so far there is no cure. If the disease continues to spread, farmers will loose their only source of income.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soil borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostem, and affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including people and insect activities), soil, and water. It can survive in the soil for decades, and consequently crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available, and integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483), which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material, and biocontrol agents. Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist varying in host range. Cavendish banana varieties (_Musa_ AAA, see links below) replaced the original eating varieties because they are resistant to the original fungal strain. They include most of the current commercial eating bananas. Cavendish-affecting strains, such as temperate and tropical races 4, as well as a new strain of race 1 reported recently from India (ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510) have emerged since, but appeared to be limited to Asia and Oceania. But Tropical race 4 (TR4), which is at present devastating Cavendish production throughout Southeast Asia, has recently also been reported for the 1st time outside that area in Jordan (ProMED-mail posts 20131107.2044265) and Mozambique (ProMED-mail post 20131206.2095450). It is of great concern worldwide.
