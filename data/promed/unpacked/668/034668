China's latest human case of bird flu infected through close contact
with ill son
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Health authorities confirmed here on Thursday [10 Jan 2008] that the
latest human case of bird flu in the eastern province of Jiangsu,
which involved a 52-year-old father, came from close contact with his
infected son and not a viral mutation.
The World Health Organization has warned that the virus that causes
the illness -- if given sufficient opportunity -- would mutate into a
form that is highly infectious and easily transmissible from person
to person. Such a change could start a global outbreak. However, this
case -- although it involved the disease apparently passing from one
person to another -- does not exactly fit the profile of an
infectious human-to-human outbreak, and it has remained something of
a puzzle.
"It has no biological features for human-to-human transmission," said
Mao Qun'an, Health Ministry spokesman. An epidemiological
investigation showed the father was infected through close contact
with his son, he said. The cases took place in the provincial
capital, Nanjing. The son, 24, and the 1st to be infected, died on 2
Dec 2007. The father was later confirmed to be infected with the H5N1
virus, which causes bird flu. At the time, the ministry said experts
had found that the virus that infected the son had originated with
poultry and had not mutated. But it remained unclear how the son was
infected in the 1st place, as neither man had any known contact with
dead poultry -- the primary known source of the ailment for humans.
The young man, surnamed Lu, developed fever, chills and other
symptoms on 24 Nov 2007 and was hospitalized on 27 Nov 2007 after
being diagnosed with lower left lobe pneumonia. His father developed
a fever and was hospitalized for lower lobe pneumonia on 3 Dec 2007,
the day after his son's death. "The father has recovered," Mao said,
adding that the cases have been effectively contained.
Local authorities had kept 83 people who had close contact with
either man under close observation but none had shown unusual
symptoms so far, according to the ministry. The case of the Lu
family, although unusual, is not the only one of its kind. Reuters
reported last month [December 2007] that a similar case occurred in
Pakistan.
The latest cases bring the number of confirmed human infections of
bird flu in China to 27 since 2003, with 17 deaths. A human-use bird
flu vaccine has been in the 2nd phase of clinical tests in Beijing by
the Beijing-based vaccine producer Sinovac Biotech and the Chinese
Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

[2] Pakistan - negative test of non-resident brother

Tests show US man, member of Pakistan bird flu family, never contracted virus
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blood testing has confirmed that a U.S. resident whose brother was
Pakistan's 1st confirmed case of H5N1 infection never contracted the
disease. The New York State health department revealed that the man's
blood showed no antibodies to H5N1, indicating he had not caught the
virus while attending his brother's funeral in Pakistan late last
year [2007]. "His final test came back. He showed no avian flu and no
antibodies to avian flu, which means he never got it," Claudia
Hutton, the department's director of public affairs, said in an
interview from Albany, NY. The man, who lives on Long Island, is part
of a large family of brothers involved in a cluster of confirmed,
probable and suspect cases. The other surviving brothers live in
Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province.
Because of the pattern of illnesses within the family, the World
Health Organization believes there was limited person-to-person
spread of the virus among the relatives. But initial diagnostic
efforts were only able to confirm one case, so follow-up blood work
will be needed to determine how many people were actually infected.
One member of the family, a veterinary worker, fell ill in late
October 2007 after helping to cull H5N1-infected poultry. While he
was sick, at least 2 of his brothers nursed him, 1st at home, then at
the hospital. The veterinary worker survived but the 2 brothers died,
one in mid-November and the other on 28 Nov 2007. The first man to
die was never tested for H5N1. But a specimen taken from the 2nd
showed he was infected with the virus. Another brother was also ill
and was hospitalized. Still another showed no signs of illness. The
brother from Long Island experienced mild cold-like symptoms after
returning from Pakistan. And his young son, who did not make the trip
with him, also had a cold; it appeared to get worse after his
father's return.
The man went to his doctor, the doctor notified local public health
authorities and they in turn alerted the state. The U.S. Centers for
Disease Control even sent a plane to New York to collect specimens
from the man and his son for testing in the CDC's Atlanta labs. They
were both negative. But, a negative test isn't proof positive there
was no infection. A test taken too late in the course of an infection
could come back negative. To close the book on the incident,
authorities collected blood samples from the man and the son to look
for the antibodies that would be present if they had been infected
with the virus. Both the father and the son were negative in antibody
testing.
The WHO said this week that blood samples from the surviving family
members in Pakistan have been sent to a U.S. Naval laboratory in
Cairo that does influenza testing for the WHO. But it could be a
couple of weeks or longer before results are available.

[These reports of bird flu outbreaks within families in China and
Pakistan are further instances of H5N1 virus infection involving
close (blood) relatives. In neither case was there any sustained
onward transmission of infection. The circumstances were different,
but in both situations the outcome was consistent with transmission
of virus between genetically related individuals only. In neither
case was there evidence of mutation of the virus to a form more
easily transmissible from human to human. In the case of the Chinese
father and son incident the source of the initial infection remains
unknown, whereas in the Pakistani family the outbreak was clearly
initiated by contact with infected poultry. Furthermore close
contact between susceptible individuals was essential for
transmission as revealed by the negative antibody test results in the
case of the non-resident brother. - Mod.CP]
