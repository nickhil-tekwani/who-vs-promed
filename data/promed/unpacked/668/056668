Why haven't we heard about any mortality/morbidity with H5N1 in the PRC
[People's Republic of China? Is there none?

[We asked this question earlier but received no direct response. However,
according to Jim Chin's CDPC-mail, the December 25, 1997 issue of the South
China Morning Post and previous messages, "the Governments of the PRC and
Hong Kong have halted movement of chickens between the PRC and Hong Kong.
Beijing's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations ordered the
temporary ban on poultry exports until a proper inspection system for birds
could be introduced, the Agriculture and Fisheries Department said. It was
hoped the cross-border monitoring system would boost confidence in the
local chicken market, which has seen sales plummet more than 60 per cent."
Obviously, if chickens in Hong Kong are infected with strain H5N1 and are
sick, the Hong Kong authorities are attempting to improve cleanliness with
an aim to decrease or eradicate the virus, and the mainland Chinese
Government has stopped movements of chickens to Hong Kong, someone must
believe that Chinese chickens have the virus, whether they say so or not.
Certainly, they have not denied this. As to whether human infections and
cases of H5N1 infections are occurring in the PCR (other than in Hong
Kong), we have not heard a word. - Mod.CHC
