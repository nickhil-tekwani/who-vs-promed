Wisconsin records 1st outbreak of dangerous bird flu strain (Update)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A dangerous bird-flu strain that has already hit numerous turkey farms in the Midwest has now been identified in a Wisconsin chicken flock, marking the 1st case of the virus in a commercial chicken farm in the US and its 1st appearance in Wisconsin, the US Department of Agriculture said Monday [13 Apr 2015].

Authorities stressed there was no risk to public health and no danger to the food supply from the highly pathogenic H5N2 strain, which was 1st detected in the region in Minnesota early last month [March 2015]. Animal health officials have long said the virus is dangerous to all commercial poultry. The only surprise of it turning up in chickens is that it took so long, said Raechelle Cline, a spokeswoman for Wisconsin's agriculture department.

The USDA said tests confirmed that a flock of about 200 000 chickens in Jefferson County, in southeastern Wisconsin, has been infected. About 20 000 chickens have already died from the disease, and the remaining 180 000 will be killed to help prevent the disease from spreading, according to the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection.

The disease has cost turkey producers more than 1.2 million birds across the Midwest -- including more than 900 000 in Minnesota, the nation's No. 1 turkey-producing state. Still, that only accounts for about 0.5 percent of the 235 million turkeys produced nationally in 2014. The disease has also struck farms in Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, South Dakota and North Dakota since early March [2015].

Although the affected Wisconsin farm produces eggs, the broiler chicken industry, which produces chickens for meat, also has been bracing for the virus since it was detected in the Pacific Northwest late last year [2014], said Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council. He noted that the chicken industry is much larger than the turkey industry, with Americans eating about 83 pounds of chickens annually compared with about 16 pounds of turkey.

"We're certainly remaining on double-heightened alert," he said, noting that most broiler production is in southeastern and mid-Atlantic states where the virus hasn't appeared.

Scientists suspect the disease is being spread by migratory waterfowl, but that hasn't been proven. They're also trying to determine how the disease has been getting inside poultry barns despite strict biosecurity measures designed to keep it out.

H5N2 turned up on several chicken farms in British Columbia, Canada, late last year [2014], and this month [April 2015] in Ontario. It also has been detected in some backyard flocks, but the Wisconsin case is the 1st detected in a US commercial chicken operation, said Joelle Hayden, a USDA spokeswoman.

Wisconsin, which typically ranks around 18th among US states in chicken production, exported poultry products worth USD 4.7 million in 2014.

No human cases have been found in the US. But as a precaution, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services is reaching out to workers who may have been exposed. Surveillance and testing also are underway at nearby farms.

About 40 countries have blocked imports of turkey or chicken products to varying degrees from the affected states, but many of those countries weren't big customers. And some major importers, such as Mexico, are scaling back their bans to specific counties.

The outbreaks have cost the industry a small fraction of its annual production, and they're not expected to affect retail prices much.

H5N2 reaches Wisconsin, expands in South Dakota, Minnesota
----------------------------------------------------------
The rash of H5N2 avian influenza outbreaks has spread farther across the Midwest, with a Wisconsin chicken farm joining the list of affected sites today [13 Apr 2015], following 2 new turkey outbreaks in South Dakota and another in Minnesota over the weekend [11-12 Apr 2015].

Poultry scientists say it's a mystery why the virus is popping up in many widely scattered locations in a short period, especially given that on most farms, just one of several barns is hit by the virus. In Minnesota, wildlife experts have not found the virus in any wild birds so far.

Wisconsin, South Dakota, Minnesota outbreaks
--------------------------------------------
The outbreak in southeastern Wisconsin's Jefferson County is the 1st on a commercial chicken farm in the Midwest, all of the previous ones having involved turkey farms (though a backyard poultry flock in Kansas was hit in March [2015]). The virus struck a commercial flock of 200 000 layer chickens, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) reported.

Increased deaths in the flock prompted officials to commission testing by the Missouri Department of Agriculture Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, with results confirmed by the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, the USDA said.

The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, in a statement today, put the size of the flock at 180 000. The USDA and state officials said they plan to mount the standard response to the outbreak, including quarantine of the farm, culling of all the chickens, and testing of poultry in the surrounding area.

The 2 new outbreaks in South Dakota, announced 10 Apr 2015, are the state's 3rd and 4th. One involves a farm with 53 000 turkeys in McCook County, which is northwest of Sioux Falls, and the other involves a flock of 46 000 turkeys in McPherson County in the northeastern part of the state.

McPherson County is just across the border from Dickey County, North Dakota, where an H5 outbreak in turkeys came to light last week. Over the weekend (11 Apr 2015), the USDA confirmed that the virus in North Dakota was the highly pathogenic H5N2 strain. The affected farm had 40 000 turkeys.

The USDA outlined the same response steps for the South Dakota and North Dakota outbreaks as in all the others announced recently.

South Dakota had 2 earlier H5N2 outbreaks, both on turkey farms in the east-central part of the state. The 1st, in Beadle County, was announced 2 Apr 2015, and the 2nd was reported a week later in Kingsbury County, which adjoins Beadle on the east.

In Minnesota, the latest outbreak is in the west-central county of Kandiyohi, which already had 2 recent outbreaks. It is the state's 14th incident since early March [2015], when the virus surfaced in Pope County, which borders Kandiyohi.

This time the virus hit a farm with 38 000 turkeys. USDA and state announcements did not specify how close the farm is to the other 2 outbreak sites. Minnesota is the nation's leading turkey-producing state, and Kandiyohi is the state's top turkey-producing county.

A mysterious pattern
--------------------
The H5N2 virus has been found in a few wild birds, which can carry it without appearing sick [see 2014 ProMED archives 108, 110 & 112 with links at end of this post. - Mod.JW]. Officials believe wild waterfowl have been spreading it across the country. Infected birds shed the virus in their feces, leading to the suspicion that the recent outbreaks have been sparked by feces somehow carried into poultry barns by vehicles or people.

But in Minnesota, at least, investigators haven't been able to confirm or rule out that suspicion, nor have they found the virus in fresh fecal samples collected from wild ducks near affected farms.

Bethany Hahn, spokeswoman for the Minnesota Board of Animal Health (MBAH), said today [13 Apr 2015] that the investigation by a large group of USDA and state officials has not yet come up with any solid answers on how the virus is spreading.

"Some of the affected flocks are in close proximity to each other," she commented by e-mail. "But other than geographical, there are no apparent connections between the affected flocks. Once the epi[demiologic] investigations are finished and we have a more complete picture, we will share that information." [This is not true for the Dakota farms, where all share single processor hub facility. - Mod.TG/Rapporteur JD]

The state Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has been testing fecal samples from wild ducks near some of the affected turkey farms and has not yet found the H5N2 virus. Michelle Carstensen, PhD, the DNR's wildlife health program supervisor, reported today that 240 samples collected last week all tested negative.

She said 120 samples were from Stearns County, the site of 4 outbreaks, and 120 came from Lac Qui Parle County, which has had one incident. More samples are being collected this week in those 2 counties and 3 others, she added.

An odd lack of links
--------------------
Carol Cardona, DVM, PhD, who holds the Ben Pomeroy Chair in Avian Health at the University of Minnesota, said in a recent interview that the lack of evidence of connections between the affected farms in Minnesota is very puzzling. She noted that she is not directly involved in the investigation of the current outbreak, but she and her colleagues have been studying virus introductions in turkeys for several years.

"This is really unprecedented," she said. "It really makes us scratch our heads, because it's not what we're brought up to think about. We're brought up to look for those connections, and when they're not there, its baffling."

When there was a large avian flu outbreak in Pennsylvania back in 1983-84, she observed, "It wasn't [a matter of] continuing multiple introductions over a wide area. The virus came out of a live-bird market and spread from farm to farm. All of our efforts are directed to stop the spread between turkey farms, but it's not even spreading to the barn next door, so how do we make sense of that mystery?"

She alluded to the fact that in most of the recent outbreaks, the virus struck in only one of several barns on a farm.

Cardona said she believes the outbreaks mark the 1st major foreign animal disease problem in Minnesota. "This is a huge deal not just for Minnesota, but for the US," she added.

She said the evidence that the virus somehow spreads from the environment to turkeys but does not easily spread from barn to barn has prompted some new biosecurity measures and recommendations. She commented that it's hard to change long-standing practices and attitudes, but given the high susceptibility of turkeys to the virus, it appears that some of the biosecurity efforts are paying off.

"Minnesota is a huge turkey state," she said. "There's a lot of turkey flocks that have had no infection and are testing negative. It's too early to say, but right now in some of the regions that have been hardest hit, not all turkey flocks have been infected, and they're trying hard and succeeding in many cases."

While it's unclear how the virus is getting into turkey barns, Cardona noted that a tiny amount of bird feces can carry a large dose of virus: "Our former poultry extension vet used to say that one milligram of duck feces carries about 10 turkey infectious doses, so that gives you an idea of how small were talking."

"We're putting a lot of effort into blocking that route of transmission," she said.

Chickens less susceptible
-------------------------
In other comments, Cardona said there is some experimental evidence that chickens are much less susceptible to the H5N2 virus than turkeys are, which would help explain why nearly all the outbreaks have involved turkey farms.

She said the USDA's Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory in Athens, Georgia, ran some experiments shortly after the virus surfaced in Washington state in December [2014]. The scientists found that when uninfected turkeys were housed with an infected turkey, they easily became infected. They also found that chickens could be infected with the virus, but it did not readily spread to healthy chickens housed with infected ones.

Highly contagious bird flu found in Buena Vista County turkey flock
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Iowa Agriculture Secretary, Bill Northey, says the USDA has confirmed the H5N2 bird flu in a flock of turkeys in northwest Iowa's Buena Vista County.

"It is the 1st case of having the highly pathogenic avian influenza in a bird flock in Iowa. We've certainly seen it in many of our surrounding states," Northey says. The 27 000 turkeys at the farm will be destroyed along with other measures to try and prevent the spread of the disease.

"We'll actually have a quarantine on that facility and the facilities nearby that, whether they are backdoor flocks or whether they are commercial flocks in that area -- all avian flocks -- so, chickens or turkeys or other birds that are in that area," Northey says. "We'll do testing to ensure that it hasn't spread to any other birds in that area."

He says the restrictions will be in place while they make sure this is an isolated case. "We'll have to have a couple of tests to be able to make sure that there is nothing else in that area, and then a period of time, about 3 weeks to make sure nothing else is impacted. And after that time we'll be able to allow movement again of birds," according to Northey. The H5N2 has been showing up in states around Iowa, mostly those in the Mississippi flyway, and Northey says it's believed migratory birds carried it here too. "That's been the presumption in other places. We don't have anything to suggest that it moved in any other way, so we believe it is likely migratory birds as we have seen it in other parts of the Midwest," Northey says.

Iowa is the top egg-producer state in the country and one of the top turkey producers, so the Ag Secretary says it's important to move quickly to handle the outbreak. "Generally it's very contagious to birds -- especially turkeys -- it'll usually cause death loss within those turkeys very quickly and it's certainly contagious within the flock. So, it's important to limit the opportunity for this to spread to other birds," Northey says.

He says there's no concern about humans catching the avian flu. "We know of no cases that this type of flu has ever impacted humans, so this is mostly about making sure that those birds in this area are not allowed to spread that to other birds," Northey says. Northey says the commercial operations in the state have good bioseurity measures in place to help prevent the spread of the avian flu.

The state of Wisconsin just confirmed its 1st case of the bird flu Monday [13 Apr 2015] and it has been confirmed in Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.

Avian flu found on another 8 Minnesota turkey farms, more than 500 000 birds die
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another 8 commercial turkey farms in Minnesota have fallen victim to deadly bird flu -- bringing the total in the state to 22.

The US Department of Agriculture confirmed Tuesday [14 Apr 2015] that the H5N2 strain of the virus has been discovered on 8 farms housing a combined 542 000 turkeys.

Those birds not killed by the virus will be euthanized to prevent the spread, bringing the total losses in the state to 1.5 million birds, with 910 000 affected on the 14 farms previously found to have the virus.

Furthermore, the USDA says that the disease is now showing up in counties where it hadn't appeared before, including 2 farms in Swift County, and farms in Le Sueur and Redwood counties.

The affected flocks are in:

- Kandiyohi County -- 30 000 turkeys (4th detection in the county)
- La Sueur County -- 21 500 turkeys (1st detection)
- Meeker County -- 25 000 turkeys (2nd detection)
- Meeker County -- 20 000 turkeys (3rd detection)
- Stearns County -- 76 000 turkeys (5th detection)
- Swift County -- 160 000 turkeys (1st detection)
- Swift County -- 154 000 turkeys (2nd detection)
- Redwood County -- 56 000 turkeys (1st detection)

More farms likely to follow
--------------------------
Experts have been predicting that the virus will continue to spread, with state veterinarian Bill Hartmann telling the Associated Press he expects more farms to be hit before the threat recedes.

As well as spreading to turkey farms in the Dakotas, NBC News reports that it has now spread to chickens, after it was confirmed that the H5N2 strain was found on a commercial chicken farm in Wisconsin.

Although 1.3 million is a small fraction of the 240 million turkeys produced in Minnesota each year, farmers have started counting the cost of the virus already, with MPR [Minnesota Public Radio] reporting they have lost a combined USD 15.7 million to avian influenza since the outbreak began.

The Star Tribune notes that Austin, Minnesota-based Hormel Foods -- the owner of Jennie-O Turkey and the nation's 2nd biggest turkey producer -- is among those who will take a financial hit after bird flu was discovered on one of its farms in Meeker County.

This doesn't include the latest flocks to be infected, and the costs to farms will grow further as it continues to spread.

Officials continue to say that the virus has not been passed to humans and the risk to public health is low.

Latest bird flu outbreak brings total Minnesota turkeys affected to 1.4 million
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minnesota, the nation's largest producer of turkeys, is at the epicenter of a nationwide outbreak.

The H5N2 bird flu has hit 8 more commercial turkey farms in Minnesota, bringing the total number of outbreaks to 22.

The latest incidents involve more than 500 000 turkeys in several counties. The number of birds affected now tallies more than 1.4 million, or about 3 percent of the state's annual turkey production.

Minnesota, the nation's largest turkey producer, is the epicenter of a nationwide outbreak of highly lethal bird flu that has hit about 15 states.

Six of the 8 new Minnesota cases are connected to turkey suppliers for Hormel Foods, owner of the well-known Jennie-O turkey brand. So far, 15 of the 22 Minnesota farms hit by the highly lethal flu are suppliers to Hormel, the nation's 2nd largest turkey processor.

The biggest outbreak announced Tuesday [14 Apr 2015] hit 2 Hormel-affiliated farms in Swift County with a total of 314 000 birds. Only a minority of birds on a farm typically die from the flu, but all turkeys are killed out of precaution.

Other outbreaks reported Tuesday:
- A 76 000 turkey flock in Stearns County, the 5th bird flu incident in that county.
- A 56 000 turkey flock in Redwood County.
- 2 farms in Meeker County totaling 45 000 birds, the 2nd and 3rd incidents in that county.
- A 30 000 turkey flock in Kandiyohi County, the 4th incident there.
- A 21 000 turkey flock in Le Sueur County.

Animal health experts hope warmer weather will slow or stop the virus's spread. But with the flu ingrained in turkey country, the state will have to be on guard against the bird flu for the next 3 to 5 years, said Steve Olson, executive director of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association.

The bird flu is believed to be spread by waterfowl that carry the virus but don't get sick from it. It is of low risk to humans.

[Regardless of how you count it, by affected birds, or premises, or flocks, this virus is spreading at exponential rates. It no longer seems likely that all of this can be blamed on contact with wild birds. One of the articles above indicates that wildlife researchers have not found the virus in the wild birds in some of the affected areas. Then something else is spreading this virus. The investigation needs to widen.

Where are the birds being harvested? Do they all share a common facility within an area? Is it being trucked back on people, or vehicles to the production sites? Is it being carried by feed trucks between production facilities? What about trucks that collect and remove litter and waste? Do they transverse between production sites?

What about workers? Are there overlaps in workers between production facilities or family members that are somehow transporting the virus home and then to different production facilities?

Surely there is a link somewhere that is causing this virus to run rampant across both turkey and commercial poultry production sites.
