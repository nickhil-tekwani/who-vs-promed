An outbreak of a maize disease has left many farmers in the North Rift uncertain of their harvests putting the country's food security at risk. They expressed fears of serious yield decline this [2016] season due to the disease referred to as head smut.

Growers are asked to practice crop rotation to break the cycle of the fungal disease that damaged over 260 000 hectares [about 642 500 acres] of maize in Rift Valley last [2015] season.

The fungal attack follows repeated outbreak of Maize Lethal Necrosis (MLN) disease that ravaged parts of the country [ProMED-mail post 20130123.1510727]. Maize production in Rift Valley dropped from 21 million bags to 16 million bags.

[Head smut caused by _Sphacelotheca reiliana_ can affect both maize and sorghum. In maize, it infects the young seedling systemically, then grows through the plant without inducing symptoms, until it eventually reaches reproductive tissues (ears and/or tassels) replacing them with masses of black spores. Distortion is common and leafy structures may replace the plant's flowering components (phyllody).

The fungus survives in the soil and may also be seed borne. Cool weather, dry seedbed conditions and nitrogen deficiency favour this disease. Disease management includes cultural techniques (such as crop rotation mentioned above), the use of clean seed and resistant varieties.

Lethal necrosis of maize (MLN) is caused by synergistic viruses. It was reported for the first time in Africa from the southern Rift area of Kenya in 2013 (ProMED-mail post 20130123.1510727) and has been spreading in the region. Recently, it has been reported to affect also millets in the region (ProMED-mail post 20150820.3590521).
