A total of 8 babies from Kibbutz Nir Or located near Gaza were infected with the intestinal bacterium _E. coli_, 4 of which were hospitalized at Soroka Hospital in Be'er Sheva. One baby is in serious condition, and 2 are suffering from kidney failure, according to reports.

The infection apparently originated from the petting zoo area of the Kibbutz. The Ministry of Health is currently performing tests and ordered to temporarily close the nursery where the children were infected.

[Given the association with the petting zoo (suggesting that this was a zoonotic outbreak) and the development of renal failure (likely hemolytic uremic syndrome), it is certainly likely that the organism in question here is one of the enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, serotype O157:H7 is the prototype. It would be interesting to know if the children (ages unstated) were treated with antimicrobials (which when given early can increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome). The infection can be transmitted from directly petting the animals (cows, sheep, goats particularly) as the organism can contaminate the hide or indirectly from contamination of the environment. - Mod.LL
