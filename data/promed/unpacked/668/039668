Devastating PMWS Continues to Spread
------------------------------------
A devastating pig disease which broke out in the North Island in 2003
and crossed to the South Island in 2006 is still spreading, farmers
say. Post-weaning multi-systemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) does not
affect humans but attacks young pigs, causing emaciation, diarrhea and
breathing problems, and can kill up to 40 percent of a piggery's
weaners in its early stages.

Found worldwide, apart from Australia, the disease inflicts a high
death rate on pigs aged 6 to 12 weeks, and continuing illness for
survivors, including infertility, according to Yahoo! Xtra News.

"PMWS is still infecting new farms ... and even some with very
stringent biosecurity practices," New Zealand Pork chief executive Sam
McIvor told NZPA. "It emphasises just how hard to manage some of these
modern diseases and viruses are," he said. "We should not take risks,"
Mr McIvor said after telling parliamentarians that at a conservative
estimate, the disease has now cost the nation's economy at least USD
44 million.

When the disease was 1st found on an Orini piggery, 24 km [15 miles]
east of Huntly in 2003, the industry argued that the outbreak occurred
only after an unidentified infectious agent was fed to pigs in
uncooked pork.

It said this probably happened when the Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry (MAF) stopped spending money on enforcing pig swill
regulations -- which required people making pig swill to boil the food
-- and before new controls were introduced on cooking imported meat.

The disease later "exploded" across farms which kept pigs outdoors:
"Spread, we believe, by gulls, sparrows, flies, an errant truck driver
and weaner pig movements before it was recognised," Mr McIvor told the
primary production select committee probing the Biosecurity Law Reform
Bill. "In the South Island, we now have about 80 percent of the herds
with it and the initial mortality was 18 percent of pigs on those
farms."

It had cost farmers USD 15m in lost income -- as well as the money
spent on breeding piglets which later fell sick -- and the wider
economy had lost another USD 29m, equivalent to USD 1.92 for every
dollar spent at the farm gate.

The USD 44m total was "conservative", he said. "I haven't put a
figure on the depression, marriage break-ups, business failures, 2
deaths and a severe heart attack that were believed to be related to
the issue," he told MPs.

There was now an effective vaccine sold for USD 3 a pig.

But Mr McIvor told the committee that research had shown that a virus
that cause a worse disease, incurable porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome, could arrive in the meat of imported animals.

Though the virus did not have human health implications, it could be
transmitted to the New Zealand pig herd with devastating effects on
animal health, and pig farmers had been at odds with MAF since 2006,
when the ministry proposed a health import standard for pigmeats. NZ
Pork also had some "fundamental concerns" around sections of the
biosecurity bill, including a shift of focus away from trying to
manage risks offshore and at the border.

[PMWS is a multifactorial disease in which porcine circovirus type 2
(PCV2) is the necessary infectious agent. Circoviruses are small
(17-22 nm in diameter), nonenveloped viruses that contain a single
strand of circular DNA. There are 2 genotypes of porcine circovirus;
only PCV2 has been shown to induce PMWS. Serologic cross-reaction
occurs between PCV1 and PCV2, but antigenic differences between the
viral genotypes allow separation of viruses using some serologic
assays. Serologic surveys show that PCV2 is widespread in swine. Some
reports have suggested that animals other than swine may be infected
with PCV2 or PCV-like viruses. However, results of serologic studies
for antibody against PCV in cattle and other livestock have been
contradictory, and experimental induction of disease using PCV1 or
PCV2 in species of livestock other than swine has not been
successful.

Initially, PMWS was identified in high health herds that were free of
most common swine pathogens but were infected with PCV2. Results from
retrospective serologic studies indicate that PCV2 infected swine
decades before PMWS was identified. Comparison of DNA from numerous
recent isolates has shown high nucleic acid sequence homology exists
among PCV2 and has not revealed a genetic determinant for virulence.
Under field conditions, swine that show signs of PMWS usually are
infected with multiple agents, but PCV2 is present consistently.
Porcine parvovirus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
virus, Actinobacillus, Pasteurella, Staphlylococcus, and Streptococcus
are common pathogens frequently isolated from pigs that show signs of
PMWS.

Severe disease has been reproduced in pigs co-infected with PCV2 and
other viruses or immunostimulant noninfectious products; however, the
mechanism of this synergy is not known. Because PCV2 replication
depends on cellular enzymes expressed during the S phase of the cell
cycle, it has been hypothesized that previous activation of those
cells supporting viral replication (not yet fully known) may promote
replication of PCV2. Enhanced viral replication might lead to
extensive loss of lymphoid cells and promote onset of PMWS. However,
under field conditions, stimulation of the immune system of piglets
with adjuvants, or with commercially available vaccines, appears to
favor induction of PMWS after infection with PCV2.

Transmission may be by direct contact with infected pigs, and
although not clearly demonstrated, by semen, contact with contaminated
fomites, exposure to contaminated feeds or biologic products, multiple
use of hypodermic needles, or by biting insects. The virus is found in
blood, saliva, feces, urine, and semen of infected swine. PCV2 is
known to persist in swine for several months under either experimental
or field conditions.

Wasting, ill thrift, and dyspnea are the clinical signs seen most
frequently in outbreaks of PMWS. Pallor, anemia, jaundice, diarrhea,
and palpable lymphadenopathy also are seen is some affected pigs. A
low-grade fever (104-106 deg F [40-41 deg C]) of several days'
duration may be seen in affected pigs. Overcrowding, poor air quality,
insufficient air exchange, and commingled age groups seems to
exacerbate PMWS. Usually, only a few pigs in a group show signs of
PMWS. The onset of disease may be acute, leading to death within a few
days in some pigs. Other pigs show a more chronic disease and fail to
gain weight or thrive.

Abortion, congenital tremors in neonatal pigs, and porcine dermatitis
and nephropathy syndrome have been associated with PCV2 and may occur
independently of PMWS

There is no treatment for PMWS. Antibiotic therapy to control other
infectious agents does not appear to affect the course once clinical
signs appear. However, use of antibiotics may help prevent additional
cases through control of intercurrent infections.

This disease continues to affect the swine industry worldwide and a
vaccine is not yet available, and may never be. However the rapid
advancements of a variety of technologies may change that. We should
not give up hope.
