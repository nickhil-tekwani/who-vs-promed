As many as 67 vultures of various species were found dead at Jitpur of Ramgram Municipality Ward No. 4 in Nawalparasi (West) [Parasi district, Lumbini Pradesh] on Wednesday [21 Apr 2021]. The rare birds were found dead near a local pond.

According to Bharat Kafle, chief at the district livestock service expert office in Nawalparasi (West), 33 white-rumped, 31 Himalayan griffons, 2 cinereous vultures, and one slender-billed vulture were found dead. An investigation is underway to find the cause behind the death of those vultures, said Kafle.

"One Himalayan griffon was found ailing in the area. The bird is undergoing treatment at the moment," he said.

Meanwhile, the remains of 2 dogs were found where the vultures were lying dead. The carcasses of 2 other dogs were also recovered in a sack nearby.

"Preliminary investigation shows that the vultures died after preying on the bodies of the dogs who were probably poisoned to death," said Deu Bahadur Rana, the project officer at Conservation Bird Nepal. "Sample collected from the incident site will be sent to Kathmandu for further lab tests."

"We were shocked to find dozens of dead vultures lying on the ground. It is extremely bad news for bird conservation in Nepal," said Shambhu Prasad Upadhyay, a local resident.

The local people suspect that the dogs had been fed poison-laced food. The municipality, however, said it was unaware of the killing of the stray dogs.

"The local unit has not launched any programme to manage stray dogs. We do not know who was involved in the poisoning of the dogs. The police should investigate into the case," said Rajesh Panthi, the chief administrative officer of Ramgram Municipality.

The government and various organisations, in their efforts to conserve the vulture population, have launched various conservation programmes. Vulture 'restaurants' were set up in several places where the birds could feed on safe carrion to increase their number. Similarly, a vulture conservation and breeding centre was established in Kasara in the Chitwan National Park in 2008.

"The death of 67 endangered vultures is a huge loss for vulture conservation. Proper investigation and study should be conducted to avert such a tragedy in the future," said DB Chaudhary, a bird conservationist. "67 vultures died on the spot where they fed on the dog carcasses. Some others that flew away after feeding the carcasses might be lying dead in other places."

According to conservationists, a wake of vultures might have flown to Jitpur from Nawalparasi -- both east and west -- Rupandehi and Kapilvastu, among other neighbouring districts, after sensing carrion and possible feed in Jitpur. The vultures, conservationists say, travel as long as 100 km [62 mi] --sometimes even longer distance --from their base in search of food.

White-rumped vultures, locally known as dangar gidda, are critically endangered scavenging birds. They are the smallest among the 9 vulture species found in Nepal. Their population in South Asia dwindled sharply during the 1990s due to diclofenac poisoning. The anti-inflammatory drug used to treat livestock found its way into the body of the birds that feed on carcasses and resulted in kidney failure, studies show.

The population of white-rumped vultures has been gradually increasing after the government banned the production, sale, and use of the drug in 2006. Around 2000 white-rumped vultures are believed to roam Nepal's skies at present.

Conservationists say vultures are helpful in containing outbreaks of cholera, rabies, plague, anthrax, and other diseases, as they feed on putrid carcasses that could spread pathogens.

A total of 9 species of vultures are found in Nepal. 4 species -- white-rumped vulture, slender-billed vulture, red-headed vulture, and Indian vulture -- are listed as critically endangered while the Egyptian vulture is listed as endangered. 3 other species are listed as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

[There are a number of things that the poisoned dogs could have had in their systems. The dogs may have been killed accidently and then used as bait for other animals, including vultures. Alternatively, the act may have been to eliminate the dogs, and the vultures were a secondary poisoning from their consumption of the dog carcasses. The carcasses of the dogs, as well as the birds, can be tested for a number of different toxins. Sadly, and unfortunately, there seems to be no shortage of avian carcasses to test, although the dog carcasses may not be in a suitable shape (dismembered, eaten, not much left of them) to have much tissue for testing.

A number of human drugs are extremely hard on the kidneys of vultures. An example, Diclofenac (trade names Voltaren, Cataflam, Solaraze), is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, widely used as a pain reliever and anti-inflammatory drug in humans and animals. Its toxicity for 3 Asian vulture species was definitively demonstrated and published in March 2006; see Swan G, Naidoo V, Cuthbert R, Green RE, Pain DJ, et al. (2006) Removing the threat of diclofenac to critically endangered Asian vultures. PLoS Biol 4(3): e66. In May 2006, the Drug Controller General (India) withdrew all licenses to manufacture diclofenac for veterinary use, and similar action was taken in Nepal and Pakistan. This action was taken to halt the unprecedented decline of 3 Gyps vulture species, which were being poisoned by diclofenac residues commonly present in carcasses of domestic livestock upon which they scavenged. Diclofenac concentrates in the kidneys of the vultures, leading to kidney failure and death of the birds.

Even though the license to manufacture this drug for veterinary purposes has stopped, this action does not preclude the possibility that it could have been used by unscrupulous individuals to either overdose live dogs or to lace the dog carcasses, and thus, the vultures. Until testing is performed on the remains of the vultures, including the kidneys, liver, stomach contents, etc., speculation as to what killed the dogs and subsequently the vultures could be a very long discussion. - Mod.TG

The population declines observed in South Asian vultures in the 1990s were mainly caused by diclofenac poisoning. This led to a ban of the drug in South Asian countries, replaced by meloxicam. Although this resulted in partial recovery of some populations, many species are still critically endangered or endangered.

The white-rumped vulture (_Gyps bengalensis_) and the slender-billed vulture are native to South and Southeast Asia. They both have been listed as critically endangered on the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) red list, as their populations severely declined. The Himalayan griffon (_Gyps himalayensis_) and the cinereous vulture (_Aegypius monachus_) are classified as 'near threatened'.

Vultures provide important ecosystem services. Obligate scavengers (that is, those that survive solely from eating dead animals) such as vultures consume large amounts of carrion derived from animal carcasses, maintaining the transfer of energy through food webs and supporting important ecosystem services such as nutrient recycling, removal of soil and water contaminants, and regulating the development and spread of diseases and populations of facultative scavengers such as foxes. - Mod.PMB
