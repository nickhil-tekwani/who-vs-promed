Cucurbit downy mildew reported in Suffolk
-----------------------------------------
Cucurbit downy mildew has been reported and confirmed this week [week
of 29 Jun - 3 Jul 2009] on pickling cucumbers in a Suffolk [Virginia]
sentinel plot. Downy mildew has also been reported in North Carolina,
Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Louisiana and Texas.

This current outbreak is an unusually early reporting of the disease
this far north. Cucurbit growers are urged to consider spraying
preventative applications for downy mildew and thoroughly scout for
the disease. Cucumber growers in particular are strongly recommended
to initiate a downy mildew protection program. Due to the location of
this outbreak and persistent rainy conditions, growers near the
outbreak are advised to be diligent for management of the disease.

Fungicide applications should be initiated prior to disease
development and applied on a 7-10 day schedule. Cultural practices,
such as avoiding low lying fields and excessive overhead irrigation,
will also suppress disease development. Cucurbit downy mildew can be
recognized initially by small yellow spots on the upper surface of the
lower leaves. When humidity is high (particularly early in the
morning) blue/gray sporulation can be found on the underside of the
leaves.

A disease affecting gardens and farms in the northeast is a relative
newcomer -- basil downy mildew. In 2008, the disease was severe on
many of the region's farms. It often goes undetected because the major
symptom -- leaf yellowing -- looks similar to nutrient deficiency. The
downy spore-bearing structures only appear on the undersides of leaves.

[Downy mildew caused by the fungus _Pseudoperonospora cubensis_ is a
devastating disease of cucurbits and has been reported from different
locations worldwide. Different pathovars with variable host
preferences seem to exist, and, for example, a strain that affects
cucumbers may not necessarily affect melons. By affecting the leaves
and thus the photosynthetic potential of its host, downy mildew
reduces yield and fruit quality, and it can eventually kill the host.
Under favourable condition, plantings can be infected so rapidly that
they appear to have been frosted. The fungus survives on cultivated or
wild cucurbits, and volunteer crop plants or weeds may serve as
sources of inoculum.

_Peronospora lamii_ causes downy mildew on basil (_Ocimum basilicum_)
and can also affect some other related species, including mints,
nettles, salvia and ornamental coleus. Symptoms vary on different
varieties of basil and may include chlorotis and necrosis of leaves
which can result in total crop loss. The fungus has been reported from
Europe and Africa, and was 1st reported in the USA in Florida in 2007.
A new, more virulent strain is suspected to have arisen in Uganda and
to be responsible for the recent spread to new areas. Seed
transmission is suspected as the reason for recent outbreaks in Europe.

Both pathogens are spread by wind, rain splash, mechanical means and
with infected plant material. Disease management may include
fungicides, phytosanitary methods to eliminate inoculum, cultural
measures (for example crop rotation) and use of cultivars with low
susceptibility or with resistance.
