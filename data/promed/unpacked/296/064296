[Rift Valley Fever is caused by a virus of the family Bunyaviridae,
genus Phlebovirus, generally results in mortality in young ruminants and
abortion in females. Most importantly, it is a zoonotic disease which has
caused mortality in humans. It has a long list of differentials in
animals and recently has expanded it's geographic range outside of
sub-Saharan Africa. Senegal has reported previous outbreaks in 1994 and
1999. This disease is not as common in animals in West Africa as it is in
East Africa,the home territory for Rift Valley Fever. - Mod.PC]
