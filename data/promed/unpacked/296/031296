[Ref: WS Tsai et al: Identification of a new begomovirus associated
with yellow leaf curl diseases of tomato and pepper in Sulawesi,
Indonesia. Plant Dis 2009; 93(3), 321; DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-93-3-0321C]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses (family _Geminiviridae_, genus
_Begomovirus_) cause severe disease epidemics of tomato and pepper
[capsicum] in Indonesia. Four tomato-infecting begomoviruses have
been reported from Java Island; _Ageratum yellow vein virus_ (AYVV),
_Tomato leaf curl Java virus_ (ToLCJV), _Tomato yellow leaf curl
Indonesia virus_ (TYLCIDV), and Pepper yellow leaf curl Indonesia
virus (PepYLCIDV). The latter was also found to infect peppers.

In 2006, symptoms typical of those caused by begomoviruses, leaf
curling, blistering, yellowing, and stunting, were observed in tomato
and pepper fields in North Sulawesi with incidence as high as 100
percent. Three symptomatic tomato leaf samples from each of 2 fields
in the Langowan area and one from each of 2 fields in the Tompaso
area, as well as one pepper sample from each of 2 fields in the
Langowan area and 2 from a field in the Tompaso area were collected.

A begomovirus DNA-A was detected by PCR in all the tomato samples, in
the 2 pepper samples from Langowan, and in one of the Tompaso pepper
samples. A begomovirus DNA-B component or virus-associated satellite
DNA were not found in any of the samples by PCR. The PCR-amplified
1.5 kb fragment from one positive sample each from the 4 tomato and 3
pepper fields were sequenced and found to have high nucleotide (nt)
sequence identity (more than 95 percent). The full-length genomes of
all 7 begomovirus isolates were 2750 or 2751 bp long. Sequence
comparisons showed all isolates to have high nt identity (more than
95.1 percent). Comparison with other sequences available in the
GenBank database (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>) shows that the
isolates have the highest nt sequence identity (66.5 percent) with
PepYLCIDV and less with other begomoviruses including those reported
from Indonesia.

On the basis of the currently accepted begomovirus species
demarcation threshold of 89 percent nt identity, the tomato and
pepper begomovirus isolates from North Sulawesi constitute a distinct
species in the genus _Begomovirus_ for which the name Tomato leaf
curl Sulawesi virus (ToLCSuV) is proposed. Phylogenetic analysis
shows the ToLCSuV isolates form a cluster distinct from other
Indonesian begomoviruses as well as begomoviruses from the
neighboring Philippines.

[From the suggested name, the authors seem to think that the new
virus belongs in the tomato leaf curl viral clade, although this is
not obvious from the data presented above. Pepper yellow leaf curl
Indonesia virus to which the new virus is reported to have the
closest relationship, has been described only recently (December
2008, see links below) from the same region. Known species in the
tomato leaf curl and tomato yellow leaf curl clades cause similar
diseases on solanaceous crops and can lead to considerable yield losses.

Begomoviruses are transmitted by different whitefly vectors (which
are a serious pest in themselves) and many can also be transmitted by
mechanical means and grafting, but they are not seed transmitted.
Begomovirus control is particularly difficult in open field crops due
to the widespread presence and wide host range of whiteflies. Disease
management may include pathogen exclusion, vector control, and
elimination of possible pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants. In
some cases, crop cultivars with increased virus resistance are available.
