Sady dies after exposure to lake algae
--------------------------------------
Until her death last weekend [12-13 Sep 2009] -- likely from exposure
to toxic blue-green algae while swimming in a Minnesota lake -- Sady
the black lab was Colin and Sarah Peltier's way of remembering Sarah's
younger brother after he was killed in Iraq. Lance Cpl. Robert
Posivio gave Sady to the couple as a wedding gift just over 4 years
ago. Posivio, 22, was killed less than a year later when his Humvee
was hit by a roadside bomb.

The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency [MPCA] said Sady was the 1st
known dog that likely died from exposure to the algae in the state
this year [2009]. The algae can produce toxins sometimes deadly to
animals if ingested.

The Peltiers, of Cottonwood, took Sady when they visited Sarah's
parents last weekend [12-13 Sep 2009] on Fox Lake near Sherburn, about
57 miles [92 km] east of Worthington. Sady played in the water Sunday
[13 Sep 2009] and went for a pontoon boat ride with her family, but
she suddenly lost energy. Then she started having muscle tremors. "We
tried to rush her to a vet in Windom, but she died before we got
there," Colin Peltier said.

The symptoms were consistent with other blue-green algae cases, and
water samples from Fox Lake showed algae that looked like it produced
toxins, said Matt Lindon, an MPCA water quality specialist. Test
results are pending.

"(The dog) basically had a nervous system shutdown, including
seizures," Lindon said.

Blue-green algae blooms are most common in warm weather when there's
been a lack of rain. Minnesota weather this year [2009] provided
average conditions for producing the blooms on lakes. The blooms
usually go away when the weather cools in September, Lindon said.

The MPCA has received complaints this year [2009] about sick dogs, but
the last deaths occurred in 2004 and 2007.

[Blue-green algae or cyanobacteria can be deadly to a number of
animals and has been responsible for the death of livestock in other
parts of the world (see ProMED refs. below). Cyanobacteria can be
found in water, soil, on rocks, and even in symbiotic relationships
with some lichen. They can be found as single cells, colonies,
filaments, sheets, and sometimes balls with a hollow center.

Cyanobacteria have several types of classification, but some produce
cyanotoxins. Some of the toxins are known as anatoxin-a, anatoxin-as,
aplysia toxin, cylindrospermopsin, domoic acid, microcystin LR,
nodularin R (from _Nodularia_), and saxitoxin. These toxins are
neurotoxic, hepatotoxic, cytotoxic, and endotoxic.

These toxics have been detrimental to a wide variety of animals, but
can also be dangerous to humans.

Additional information about cyanobacteria, especially as it relates
to human health, can be found at on the Health Canada website at
