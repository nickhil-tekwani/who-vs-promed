The Blumenau City Administration, in the Valei do Itajai, confirmed on Thu 28 Apr 2021 the first positive case of yellow fever [YF] in the city in 2021 [Infected where? Sylvan? Rural? Periurban? - Mod.RNA]. The patient is a 39 year old man who is hospitalized in serious condition in the intensive care unit (ICU) [Hospitalized when? Symptoms when? - Mod.RNA].

The case was registered on 27 Apr 2021. According to the Santa Catarina Office of Epidemiological Surveillance (DRIVE/SC), the patient had no record of [YF] vaccination in the Information System of the National Program of Immunizations (SIPNI). He is undergoing treatment in the Santa Isabel Hospital.

Up to the present, Santa Catarina has registered 6 other confirmed [YF] cases in 2021; 2 of the patients have died. The first fatal victim was a 34 year old man, resident of Aguas Mornas in Grande Florianopolis. The other lived in Sao Bonifacio in the same region and was 59 years old.

The best way to prevent the disease is vaccination. Immunization is free of cost and is available at all health posts. Yellow fever is an acute infectious disease, and, in forested environments, mosquitoes in the genera _Haemagogus_ and _Sabethes_ transmit the virus. In the urban cycle, the virus is transmitted to humans by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.

Monkeys, which live in the same forested environment as the mosquitoes, are the main victims of the disease. The main symptoms of the disease [in humans] are abrupt onset of fever, chills, intense headache, back and body pain, nausea, vomiting, weakness and fatigue, abdominal pain, and jaundice (yellow skin).

[Both human and monkey yellow fever cases have been occurring in Santa Clara this year (2021). The number of human cases has increased from 2 reported on 11 Mar 2021 (see Yellow fever - Americas (05): Brazil (SC) human, monkey 20210315.8247346) to 3, and now to 7 reported above. These human cases represent spillover from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle. Fortunately, there has been no urban yellow fever transmission in Brazil since 1942. Increased surveillance is important to know where yellow fever virus transmission is taking place. People living in or visiting these localities should be vaccinated to avoid more human cases. - Mod.TY
