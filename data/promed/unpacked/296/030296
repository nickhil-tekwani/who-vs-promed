The Disease Surveillance and Notification Officers (DSNO) has announced 3 fresh cases of the virulent and deadly Lassa fever in Ondo state. It identified places where the disease was detected as Owo and Akure North local government areas of the State.

DSNO officials stated this when giving its reports to the Commissioner for Health, Dr. Dayo Adeyanyu at his office in Akure. According to DSNO, a case was 1st identified in Eyin-Ogbe, Owo LGA and was confirmed at Irrua Specialist Hospital, Edo State. Up to 2 suspected cases were also identified in Ayede-Ogbese, Akure North LGA, and samples sent to same hospital for confirmation.

However, Adeyanju said "there is active surveillance in all our LGAs, much more so when we learnt of the last outbreak in Anambra and Delta states, we felt we were likely to be prone. Our surveillance became much more active." He said the proactive measures had yielded results because the DSNOs and the community were able to identify the symptoms easily and promptly sprang into action.

The commissioner assured the people of the state that there was no cause for alarm as the confirmed case was presently receiving treatment in Irrua, while the suspected cases were being placed on check. "We need to keep tabs on them and ensure that we are able to trace them to the last person so we can curtail it.

"At the moment, there is no cause for alarm; the outbreak control team has been active, sensitization has been ongoing, jingles and other resources are maximally exploited," he said.

[It is good to see that the local health authorities are responding quickly to the 1 confirmed and 2 suspected cases of Lassa fever. These cases are from 2 different locations, indicating different exposure events. Good surveillance and rapid diagnosis is important to prevent spread in health care facilities swell as to provide timely, appropriate treatment such as ribavirin, which has been shown to be beneficial in Lassa fever, in conjunction with supportive therapy such as fluids.

The circumstances under which the reported cases acquired the Lassa fever virus infection are not mentioned but presumably is of rodent origin. Lassa virus is endemic in rodents in Nigeria and cases can occur at any time. The infection can be contracted from an infected patient or from exposure to food materials contaminated by infected rodents.

Prevention and control of Lassa fever in nature depends on control of the rodent reservoir, which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians. Preventing entry of rodents into the home and keeping food materials tightly covered are helpful measures to prevent infection. Appropriate use of personal protective equipment is essential to prevent virus transmission to health care workers in hospitals and clinics.

Lassa virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and can cause acute hemorrhagic fever in humans.
