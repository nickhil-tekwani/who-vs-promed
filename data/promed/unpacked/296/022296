[In the past 11 days since the last update there have been a total of 2 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia. Both cases were reported from Riyadh city in Riyadh region, both cases were males, both cases had a history of contact with camels, and both cases were hospitalized. In addition to the 2 newly confirmed cases, there were 3 cases reported to have recovered during this period as well, 2 were from Riyadh region and 1 was from Najran region.

With the addition of these 2 newly confirmed cases, the total number of newly confirmed cases reported during the month of October 2018 is now 7, compared with 13 cases reported during the month of September 2018. The cases come from Riyadh region (5), Najran region (1), and Makkah region, (1). 6 cases were in males, 5 cases had a history of contact with camels, 1 was classified as a primary community acquired case without contact with camels, and 1 was in a household contact of a previously confirmed case. To date, 4 of these cases were reported to have recovered.

In the absence of nosocomial transmission, it appears as though October is a slower month for disease transmission, but it is still occurring in a sporadic nature.
