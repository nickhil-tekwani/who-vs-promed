Doctors in Oregon have described what might be one of the unluckiest encounters between man and tick ever documented. They report treating a 70-year-old man who became sick with 3 entirely different infections after a single tick bite.

According to a recent case study, published last month [April 2021] in BMJ Case Reports [https://casereports.bmj.com/content/14/4/e241004], the man visited an emergency room with symptoms of fever, nausea, and a distinct swelling around his ankle along with leg pain. Tests showed that he had anemia (a low red blood cell count) and thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), as well as acute kidney injury and possible liver damage.

The man told doctors that a month earlier he had noticed a bite on the same ankle -- presumed to have been caused by an insect. The bite had appeared following a trip to the Northeastern US, leading doctors to suspect that it was actually caused by a disease-carrying tick (an 8-legged arachnid). When further blood tests arrived, though, even they were surprised by the results. The man not only tested positive for _Borrelia burgdorferi_, the cause of Lyme disease, but also the bacteria _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ and _Babesia microti_, the causes of anaplasmosis and babesiosis, respectively.

Lyme showing up at the same time as another tick-borne infection is fairly common since ticks are routinely chock full of germs. But "infection with 3 tickborne illnesses at one time is relatively rare," the doctors wrote.

[Since _Borrelia burgdorferi_, the cause of Lyme disease, _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, the cause of anaplasmosis (also known as human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA), _Babesia microti_, the cause of babesiosis, _Borrelia miyamotoi_, the cause of a relapsing fever-like illness, and Powassan virus, the cause of an encephalitis, are all transmitted by the same hard-bodied _Ixodes_ tick species (_I. scapularis_) in the same geographic locations of North America, it is possible that co-infections with two or more of these tick-borne pathogens may occur. Typically, the nymph stage of the tick, which is about the size of a poppy seed, transmits these diseases. For a picture of the nymph, see http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/babesiosis/. Various small and medium-sized mammals and ground-feeding bird species are reservoir-competent hosts.

Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease) is the most common human tick-borne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere, occurring predominately in temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. It is caused by pathogenic genospecies of the spirochete, _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato group. The species of tick, the host species, borrelial genospecies, and carriage rates of borreliae in ticks all vary according to the geographical location. _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto is the main pathogenic species identified in North America. It also occurs in Europe but is less prevalent in most regions than _B. garinii_ or _B. afzelii_, the 2 major European pathogenic genospecies. All are present in the United Kingdom (UK), and _B. garinii_ appears to be the most prevalent pathogenic genospecies in most endemic areas of that country (https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(11)00072-7/fulltext).

Illness onset in Infected persons who are symptomatic with anaplasmosis occurs 5-21 days after a bite from an infected tick. Initial presentation typically includes sudden onset of fever, headache, malaise, and myalgia, often accompanied by thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver transaminases. Approximately 5 to 7 percent of patients require intensive care, and the disease can be fatal. Severe infections can include prolonged fever, shock, confusion, seizures, pneumonitis, renal failure, hemorrhages, and death.

The presence of hemolytic anemia suggests babesiosis. Some patients also have splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or jaundice. Severe cases can be associated with marked thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemodynamic instability, acute respiratory distress, myocardial infarction, renal failure, hepatic compromise, altered mental status, and death.

Their diagnoses are based on specific antibody tests, detection of specific nucleic acid (DNA) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and microscopy of thick and thin blood films. In babesiosis, manual (non-automated) review of Wright-stained peripheral blood smears or buffy-coat preparations can demonstrate intraerythrocytic ring forms. Sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish between _Babesia_ and _Plasmodium_ (especially _P. falciparum_) parasites. Cytoplasmic inclusions consisting of vacuolar microcolonies of _A. phagocytophilum_ within neutrophils can be found in 20 to 80 percent of patients with anaplasmosis, unlike the rarity of visualizing organisms within circulating mononuclear cells in patients with human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (Weinberg G: Laboratory diagnosis of ehrlichiosis and babesiosis. Pediat Infect Dis J 2001; 20(4): 435-7; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11332670/).

Because _A. phagocytophilum_ and _B. microti_ are found in the bloodstream, infected blood can serve as a vehicle for person-to-person transmission (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. _A. phagocytophilum_ transmitted through blood transfusion -- Minnesota, 2007. MMWR 2008; 57(42): 1145-8 [date cited]; http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5742a1.htm).

Treatment with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily orally or intravenously for 10 days for all symptomatic patients suspected of having anaplasmosis is recommended for a minimum total course of 10 days. This treatment regimen should be adequate therapy for patients with anaplasmosis alone and for patients who are co-infected with Lyme disease but is not an effective therapy for patients who are co-infected with _B. microti_.

Most asymptomatic persons with babesiosis do not require treatment. For ill patients, babesiosis is treated for at least 7-10 days with a combination of either: atovaquone plus azithromycin, or clindamycin plus quinine (this combination is the standard of care for severely ill patients). - Mod.ML
