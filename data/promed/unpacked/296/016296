Four persons of a family died while doctors are trying to save one person, following suspected food poisoning at Isamudra village near Bharamasagar in Chitradurga taluk [Karnataka]. The deceased are [TN, 45, his wife SN, 40, his mother Gi, and daughter Ra, 16. The son Rl, 21], is undergoing treatment in Davanagere.

They had ragi mudde (finger millet balls), rice, and sambar [lentil and vegetable stew] for dinner on 12 Jul 2021. Within half an hour, they had erratic bowel movements, forcing relatives to rush them to a government hospital at Bharamasagar. From there, they were taken to the district hospital at Chitradurga, where SN and Gi died.

Later, the remaining 3 were shifted to a private hospital in Davangere. TN died on the way to Davangere while Ra, who was preparing for SSLC [Secondary School Leaving Certificate] examinations, died in the hospital late in the evening on 13 Jul 2021. Rl is in the intensive care unit.

The doctors treating them suspect food poisoning. Among 6 members in the family, Rk, 19, did not suffer any health complications. She is the only one who did not have ragi mudde.

G Radhika, Superintendent of Police in Chitradurga, told The Hindu a food sample had been collected from their house for forensic tests. "We have booked a case under Section 174C of the IPC for further investigation," she said.

["Finger millet, the brown and fine mustard-like grain is a staple cereal in the Indian subcontinent and Africa. This hardy, millennia-old, resilient and low-rain fed crop is popularly known as ragi across South India. The oldest evidence for finger millet dates to 3000 BC from what is now central Sudan where this grain was domesticated. However, today, India is one of the largest producers of finger millet in the world."

Information on the clinical signs for the affected individuals is sparse, but knowing one person who did not eat the millet was not affected, seems to point to it as the cause. Without clinical signs other than "erratic" bowel movements it is hard to propose possible toxins. However, I do wonder if the grain was treated with arsenic or other pesticide or heavy metal in an effort to extend its shelf-life. Perhaps the grain was not washed before use? More information on this outbreak would be appreciated.

We extend our sympathies to the family and to those close to them. - Mod.TG
