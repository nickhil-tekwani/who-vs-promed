Australia: Outbreak of Gastroenteritis Affects Hospitals in New South Wales
----------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of gastroenteritis has struck Woy Woy and Gosford Hospitals
with 28 patients and 9 staff members falling ill since Sun 11 Apr 2004.
While Central Coast Health has yet to determine how the outbreak started,
the illness has been contained to 2 wards in Gosford Hospital and to the
general ward at Woy Woy Hospital.
A spokeswoman for Central Coast Health said access to the affected wards
has been restricted to prevent further spread. "An outbreak like this can
occur at any hospital and any time, and it is very hard to determine who
was the first person with the virus. However, the illness is most often
transmitted via direct contact with an infected person," she said. "We are
working very hard to contain the spread of the outbreak and believe that it
has been contained."
Staff and visitors to the affected wards at Gosford and Woy Woy Hospitals
are wearing additional protective clothing including gloves and masks to
guard against infection. "It is a necessary precaution, and the affected
wards will be kept in isolation with no patients being admitted into or
transferred out of these wards." The most common symptoms of
gastroenteritis include nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhoea, lack
of appetite and fever. The spokeswoman said anyone experiencing these
symptoms should contact their local general practitioner.
"The characteristics of the outbreak reflect similar characteristics to
gastroenteritis currently occurring within the Central Coast community.
People with gastroenteritis should rest and increase the amounts of fluids
they drink," she said. "In some cases medication and hospitalisation may be
required. Infants, young children and the elderly should seek medical
attention."

[2] Norovirus, confirmed, Cornell school outbreak - USA (PA)

USA (PA): Norovirus Confirmed as Cause of Outbreak at Cornell School
-------------------------------------------------
[Previously in Part [1] of ProMED-mail post " Viral gastroenteritis update
2004 (13) 20040408.0953" it was reported that laboratory investigation of
an outbreak of gastroenteritis at Cornell School had failed to confirm a
the preliminary diagnosis of norovirus infection. The following report
describes additional diagnostic tests carried out subsequently that reverse
the earlier conclusion and now positively identify the etiologic agent as a
norovirus. - Mod.CP]
The Allegheny County Health Department today reported that a 3rd round of
laboratory tests indicate that norovirus infection was, after all, the
cause of the outbreak of intestinal illness that affected the Cornell
School District during March 2004. The latest tests, performed by the
Pennsylvania Department of Health using more sensitive test kits supplied
by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, detected norovirus
in 5 of 11 stool samples taken from people who were ill. Norovirus is
highly contagious, found in the vomit and stool of infected people, and can
spread easily from person to person as a result of direct contact or
through contaminated surfaces and objects in the environment.
Health officials suspect that the 200 cases of intestinal illness reported
in the Cornell outbreak were transmitted from person to person. The
reported cases include 130 students, 16 staff and 54 others who are related
to the affected students and staff, an indication the illness also spread
within families and households.
No new cases have been reported since the school re-opened early in April
2004. The symptoms of norovirus illness typically last one or 2 days and
include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramping. People are
contagious for about 2 days after recovery, so good hand-washing habits are
extremely important after recovering from the illness.
