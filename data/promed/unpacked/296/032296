Health, Malaysia, 19 Mar 1999

To date, there are 133 reported cases of either confirmed or suspected
cases of Japanese encephalitis [JE] in the outbreak which first started in
Perak, and later in Negri Sembilan. Of these, 54 persons have died. In this
outbreak, out of 133 reported cases, 42 have been confirmed to have JE.
Many cases may soon be confirmed as the laboratory results become available.
Of the fatal cases, patients typically presented with symptoms of high
fever, headache for 5 to 7 days, then deterioration of mental status,
convulsions and coma before death. A close association has been established
between the majority of these patients and pig farming industries in Perak
and Negri Sembilan. Many of these patients have direct and close contact
with the animals.
Laboratory tests were carried out from the beginning of the outbreak.
Besides the Ministry of Health laboratories, others like the University of
Malaya laboratory were also involved in the investigation. In December
1998, 19 specimens from patients in the Perak outbreak were sent to the WHO
Collaborating Centre for Tropical Diseases in Nagasaki, Japan, 4 of these
patients were confirmed to have JE by both the Institute of Medical
Research laboratory in Kuala Lumpur and the WHO Collaborating Centre in
Nagasaki.
In addition to JE, there is now evidence of a new virus. This virus was
isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of 5 out of 30 patients sent to
Professor S K Lam and his team at the Department of Medical Microbiology,
University of Malaya. Their finding was subsequently confirmed by the
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, USA. This virus is a member of the
Paramyxovirus [see comments below - Mod.CHC] family. It resembles Hendra
virus which was first isolated in Hendra, a suburb of Brisbane in
Queensland, Australia. In the outbreak which occurred in 1994, race horses
and 3 persons whose work involved close contact with horses were taken ill.
2 of the 3 persons subsequently died, one died of severe respiratory
infection and the other of encephalitis after a latent period of 13 months.
Little is known about this new virus. We are not sure if the virus is a
pathogen. [definitely see comments below - Mod.CHC]
The probable mode of transmission of this new virus is by direct contact
with tissue fluids including urine. The importance of droplet transmission
is not known but work done on horses shows that the virus is not carried on
the horses' breath. In the Australian experience, the outbreak in Brisbane
affected 2 humans including one death. A second incident occurred in
Mackay, 1000 km north of Brisbane. In this incident a farmer died from
meningoencephalitis. It was felt that the most likely wildlife source
linking these two outbreaks would be either birds or fruit bats. But
studies also showed that despite the close relationship between bat
caregivers and bats, there is no evidence of seroconversion among the
caregivers. Thus this virus appears to have low transmissibility.
The Ministry of Health cannot overemphasize the importance of ongoing
control measures to check the spread of JE virus. However, in the light of
this new virus, additional precautions have to be taken. As the
paramyxovirus is a relatively large virus, the practice of universal
precaution and use of face masks, goggles and gown is recommended for
health care workers when handling patients suspected of JE/Hendra-like
virus infection.
The following actions have been taken by the various Ministries in the
control of the present JE outbreak:
1. Vaccination of high-risk groups of the human population.
2. Vector control against the _Culex_ mosquitoes by fogging and larviciding
including destroying _Culex_ breeding sites by land filling and improving
sanitation/drainage.
3. Hospital management of JE patients.
4. Health education through the mass media to inform the public on
preventive measures to be taken.
5. Vaccination of pigs.
6. Due to the isolation of the new virus additional measures must be taken
by pig handlers such as wearing of protective clothing, boots, gloves,
gowns, goggles and face shields; and washing of hands and body parts with
soap before leaving the pig farms.
7. Restricting the movement of pigs from infected farms to other areas is
done by the Police.
8. Setting up a Central Control Operations Room to coordinate the
activities carried out by the various Ministries.

[ This seems to be an official report. Some comments are in order.
1. Given previous reports that JE virus was responsible for many infections
and deaths and then the communications that the initial tests may have been
nonspecific and that some of them were due to a Hendra-like virus, I think
I'll just wait for confirmation of these cases before I swallow the data.
Clearly, there is little doubt that JEV is circulating in the areas in
question and causing some of these illnesses. Even if 42 of 133 cases have
been confirmed as due to JEV, 91 have not. Have these 91 been tested for
evidence of infection with the Hendra-like virus.
2. Nothing is being reported regarding people NOT in close contact with
pigs or piggeries but living in the area. I know of no data that would
suggest that JEV is transmitted from infected animals, although this is
certainly possible. What isn't?
3. The proper family name for the paramyxoviruses is _Paramyxoviridae_. I
do not have all my books at hand but, last I looked, this is one of three
families in the Order Mononegavirales. The family has been divided into
two subfamilies, Paramyxovirinae (including viruses if the genus
_Morbillivirus_ [canine distemper, measles, Phocine distemper,
peste-des-petits-ruminants, and rinderpest viruses] and the genus
_Paramyxovirus_ [Newcastle disease virus (9 avian paramyxoviruses, mumps,
4 parainfluenza viruses)] and Pneumovirinae (including viruses of the genus
_Pneumovirus_ [bovine respiratory syncytial, human respiratory syncytial,
pneumonia virus of mice, and turkey rhinotracheitis viruses)]. Other
viruses of the family include: Fer-de-Lance, La-Piedad-Michoacan-Mexico,
Mapuera, and Narivaviruses.
4. As for the comment that little is known about this new virus and the
uncertainty that the Hendra-like virus is a pathogen, as the Ministry said,
no definitive information is available about this particular isolate.
ProMED-mail is using the term "Hendra-like" because the virus has already
been shown to be not identical to the prototype Hendra virus from
Australia. It should be kept in mind, however, that small differences in
nucleotide sequence can translate to significant (even if small)
differences in expressed polypeptides. It is certain that Hendra virus
itself is a humanand equid pathogen. It seems clear that the Hendra-like
virus is a pig pathogen and human pathogen as well.
5. Extrapolating the Australian experience, that the infection rate in bat
caregivers is low and therefore that the transmissibility of Hendra virus
is low, does not take into consideration that Hendra virus has not been
shown to infect pigs, so that we know nothing about the transmissibility of
this virus from pigs to humans -- at least until the Malaysian outbreak.
6. What the size of this virus has to do with using special precautions
eludes me.
7. Many JE control measures are being taken. This seems reasonable in
order to control the JE aspect of this epidemic. Vaccination of humans and
pigs against JEV, and vector control likely will have little effect on the
prevalence of the Hendra-like virus. Depopulating piggeries certainly will
remove these animals as vertebrate hosts, for now.
Clearly this is a huge problem but the Malaysian Government appears to be
doing all it can at present. More data should be forthcoming this week
when the Malaysian authorities have the opportunity to work with the CDC
and Australian researchers who are on their way there at this time. -
