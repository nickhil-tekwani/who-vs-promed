3 people were treated for exposure to rabies after a raccoon attacked a person on a walking trail earlier this week near a subdivision, state health officials said Friday [30 Jul 2021].

The animal went after a person in Cullman earlier this week while showing signs of the disease known as rabies so the raccoon was collected and tested for the neurological illness, the Alabama Department of Public Health said in a statement.

An investigation showed 3 people were potentially exposed to rabies, so they were treated to prevent infection.

"Wildlife species pose the greatest risk of rabies, and they should be avoided if at all possible, especially when the animal is acting strangely or aggressively," said Dr. Dee W. Jones, the state public health veterinarian.

The rabies virus is transmitted by saliva. Left untreated in humans, it can be fatal. [It can be fatal in animals, as well, but there is no treatment for animals. There is a preventative vaccine for animals. - Mod.TG]

A Prattville woman has undergone rabies treatments [Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) - Mod.TG] after being scratched by a stray cat.

The cat was tested and came back positive for southeastern raccoon rabies, said Dr. Dee Jones, state veterinarian with the Alabama Department of Public Health. The incident occurred on Durden Road when the stray cat got into a fight with the woman's cat. She received the scratch when she broke up the fight.

"There's not many rabies reports coming out of Autauga County," Jones said. "And usually the vector is raccoons, not domesticated animals. But this cat was a stray, likely unvaccinated against rabies and came into contact with a rabid raccoon."

People hear "rabies" and often overreact, he said.

"Rabies is spread through the saliva of the infected animal," Jones said. "I am unaware of a human case of rabies being spread by a scratch from an infected animal. But out of an abundance of caution, we advise people who have been scratched by a rabid animal to undergo treatments." [If saliva from the infected cat got into the scratch, the person is exposed. Cats chew on their nails and this could coat the nails in saliva, and a scratch could introduce the virus particles to the wound. - Mod.TG]

Once rabies develops in a person's body, it is 99% fatal, according to the Mayo Clinic's website. If taken in time a series of inoculations [PEP - Mod.TG] is almost 100% effective in preventing rabies from developing.

In the past the regime was 14 shots in the abdomen over a period of 30 days. Now the practice calls for a few shots in the arm, or a muscle, over a period of 2 weeks.

The best way to prevent coming into contact with rabies is vaccinating your dogs and cats, Jones said. State law requires yearly vaccinations for dogs, cats and pet ferrets.

- Do not allow pets to run loose; confine them within a fenced-in area or with a leash.
- Do not leave uneaten pet food or scraps near your residence.
- Do not illegally feed or keep wildlife as pets.
- Do not go near wildlife or domestic animals acting in a strange or unusual manner.
- Caution children not to go near any stray or wild animal, regardless of its behavior.
- Advise children to tell an adult if they are bitten or scratched by any animal.

A person who is bitten or scratched by an animal should wash wounds immediately with mild soap and water, apply first aid and seek medical attention or contact the county health department immediately.

[3] Maine: oral rabies bait distribution
Date: Mon 2 Aug 2021
Source: Q96.1 [edited]
https://q961.com/oral-rabies-vaccines-to-be-distributed-in-northern-maine-in-august/


The Maine Center for Disease Control is teaming with the USDA to distribute oral rabies vaccine in wooded areas of northern Maine this month [Aug 2021] in an effort to curb the spread of the disease.

The project is specifically targeting raccoons. Tens of thousands of rabies vaccines will be dropped by air and others placed on the ground over a 2600-square-mile area covering several communities including Houlton, Mars Hill and Patten.

The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said the vaccines will be distributed between August 6 and August 11 through a program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

The CDC says the oral rabies vaccine baits are coated with fish meal and dispensed in 1-inch square cubes or 2-inch plastic sachets. Humans and pets cannot get rabies from contact with the baits but should leave them undisturbed. If skin contact occurs, you should rinse the affected area with warm water and soap.

This vaccine is shown to be safe in more than 60 species of animals, including domestic dogs and cats. Dogs that consume large numbers of baits may experience an upset stomach, but there are no known long-term health risks.

To help protect yourself and your pet against rabies:
- Keep your pet's rabies vaccination current
- Feed pets indoors
- Keep garbage cans or other sources of food tightly secured
- Do not feed, touch, or adopt wild animals and be cautious of stray dogs and cats
- Do not relocate wildlife because this can spread rabies into new areas
- Wash wounds resulting from potential rabies exposures thoroughly with soap and water.

[4] South Carolina: puppy, human exposure
Date: Thu 29 Jul 2021 2:02 AM GMT+8
Source: WRDW [edited]
https://www.wrdw.com/2021/07/28/deeply-concerned-health-officials-issue-warning-about-rabid-csra-puppy/


The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDEC) wants to hear from anyone who believes they may have come into contact with a rabid puppy from the CSRA (Central Savannah River Area) to contact DHEC's Aiken or Florence office, if they are not already in communication with the agency.

Since announcing Friday [23 Jul 2021] the tan-and-white pit bull puppy had tested positive for rabies, DHEC has learned it was about 7 weeks old and weighed about 5 pounds [2.3 kg].

Anyone who came into contact with the puppy's saliva may have been exposed to rabies and should seek medical attention. Animals can shed the rabies virus for up to 2 weeks before they show signs of rabies.

"We are deeply concerned about all persons involved, as rabies is fatal if left untreated after exposure," said Dr. Gil Potter, DHEC's Midlands region medical director.

DHEC reported the puppy was born in Edgefield County, near Lanier Road in Johnston. It and a littermate were taken to Augusta, Georgia, from 14-17 Jul 2021.

Staff have learned both puppies were brought to a gathering in Clearwater around the same time. The littermate is unaccounted for and was allegedly given away during the gathering. The rabid puppy was later taken to a birthday party in Florence.

The agency is attempting to identify the littermate to verify its health status and prevent the potential spread of the rabies virus.

DHEC is having difficulty obtaining contact information from people involved with the gathering in Clearwater.

Anyone who attended the Clearwater gathering or who may have had or is in contact with the littermate puppy should contact their health care provider and DHEC's Environmental Affairs Aiken office or Florence office during normal business hours (8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday) .

"Keeping your pets up to date on their rabies vaccination is the easiest way to protect you and your family from this deadly virus," said Terri McCollister, DHEC rabies program team leader. "Any mammal has the ability to carry and transmit the disease to humans or pets. So, give wild and stray animals plenty of space."

In South Carolina, rabies is most often found in wildlife such as raccoons, skunks, foxes, and bats, but pets are susceptible to the virus.

"If you see an animal in need, avoid touching it," McCollister said.

Instead, contact someone trained in handling animals, such as your local animal control officer, wildlife control officer or a wildlife rehabilitator.

This puppy is the 1st animal in Edgefield County to test positive for rabies in 2021. There have been 46 cases of rabid animals across South Carolina this year [2021].

[5] Delaware: fox, human exposure
Date: Thu 12 Aug 2021
Source: News Delaware [edited]
https://news.delaware.gov/2021/08/12/suspected-rabid-fox-bites-dover-resident-dph-advises-those-who-may-have-been-exposed/


The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) is advising Dover residents who live or spend time in the area of the intersection of routes 1 and 42 in Dover of a possible case of rabies in a fox which bit a human on 9 Aug 2021. The fox was tested for rabies on 11 Aug 2021 but results were indeterminant. Out of an abundance of caution, DPH is assuming the fox was rabid and advising members of the community to take precautions. DPH is contacting the individual who was bitten to recommend treatment.

Anyone who thinks they may have been bitten, scratched, or come in contact with a fox in this area should immediately contact their health care provider or call the DPH Rabies Program. An epidemiologist is available 24/7. Anyone in the area who thinks a fox might have bitten their pet should call their private veterinarian for examination, treatment, and to report the exposure to Delaware Department of Agriculture.

Rabies is a preventable disease. DPH recommends individuals take the following steps to prevent rabies exposure:
- All dogs, cats, and ferrets 6 months of age and older are required by Delaware law to be vaccinated against rabies by a licensed veterinarian.
- Pet owners can reduce the possibility of pets being exposed to rabies by keeping them indoors and not letting them roam free. It is especially important for pet owners who do allow their cats to roam outdoors to vaccinate their pets.
- Do not touch or otherwise handle wild or unfamiliar animals, including cats and dogs, even if they appear friendly.
- Do not keep your pet's food or water outdoors; bowls can attract wild and stray animals.
- Do not feed feral animals, including cats, as the risk of rabies in wildlife is significant.
- Spaying or neutering your pet may reduce the tendency to roam or fight and, thus, reduce the chance they will be exposed to rabies.
- Keep your garbage securely covered.
- Consider vaccinating livestock and horses, as well. It is recommended to consult with your private veterinarian if you have any questions regarding whether your animal(s) should be vaccinated against rabies.

Since 1 Jan 2021 DPH has performed rabies tests on 107 animals, 7 of which were confirmed to be rabid, which includes 2 cats, 1 dog, 1 raccoon, 1 skunk, and 2 bats. DPH only announces those rabies cases for which it is possible the animal had unknown contacts with additional humans or pets.

In 2020, DPH performed rabies tests on 121 animals, 4 of which were confirmed to be rabid, including 1 raccoon, 1 bat, and 2 cats.

Rabies is an infectious disease affecting the nervous system of humans and other mammals. Infection can occur through the bite or scratch of an infected animal or if saliva from such an animal gets into the eyes, nose, mouth, or an opening in the skin. Rabies in humans and animals cannot be cured once (signs in animals) symptoms in human beings appear. Therefore, if a human has been exposed, and the animal is unavailable to be quarantined or tested, DPH recommends people receive post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) treatment, a series of 4 vaccinations, as a precautionary measure.

If you encounter a wild animal behaving aggressively, it is recommended you contact the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control's (DNREC) Wildlife Section. Staff will determine whether it is more appropriate to refer callers to a private nuisance wildlife control operator. A listing of nuisance wildlife control operators can be found at
https://wildlifehelp.org/. Calls after hours and on weekends can be made to the 24-hour dispatch number.

Do not throw items at the animal or make loud banging noises, which may startle the animal and cause it to attack. Instead, your initial response -- if the animal is behaving in an aggressive manner or appears to be foaming at the mouth -- should be to raise your hands above your head to make yourself appear larger to the animal while slowly backing away from it. If the animal starts coming toward you, raise your voice and yell sternly at it, "Get away!" If all that fails, use any means to protect yourself including throwing an object at the animal or trying to keep it away by using a long stick, shovel, or fishing pole.

If you encounter a stray or feral domestic animal, such as a cat or dog, behaving aggressively, contact the Office of Animal Welfare.

To report a sick or hurt wild animal, Delaware residents are asked to contact the DNREC's Wildlife Section. Staff will determine whether it is more appropriate to refer callers to a permitted volunteer wildlife rehabilitator. If you encounter a sick stray domestic animal, such as a cat or dog, contact the Office of Animal Welfare.

[Rabies is a deadly virus. It is always fatal to an animal infected with the rabies virus, which has not been protected with a rabies vaccination. Your pet, even an indoor pet, needs to be vaccinated against rabies. While there is a 3-year vaccine for pets, many local areas having a large rabies burden require pet records to reflect an annual vaccination. Check with your state, county or parish to determine how often your local area requires rabies prevention vaccine. Remember that vaccinating your animals (large animals as well) is building a barrier between you and this deadly disease.

Without prompt and appropriate medical attention this virus can be fatal to human beings. This is one disease requiring prompt and accurate medical attention.

Humans exposed to the rabies virus can receive post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) treatment. This is a series of shots to prevent the exposed human from developing and dying from this deadly disease. - Mod.TG
