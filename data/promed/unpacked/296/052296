Massachusetts health officials say a woman visiting Six Flags New England was bitten this week [Wed 31 Jul 2013] by a rabid skunk and are urging anyone who may have come in contact with a skunk at the theme park to contact the state health department.

The health department said Friday [2 Aug 2013] anyone who visited the park between 21 Jul and 31 Jul 2013 and was bitten or scratched by a skunk may have been exposed to rabies and should contact their healthcare provider. Only people with direct exposure to skunk saliva are at risk.

The health department said the woman visiting the park Wednesday [31 Jul 2013] saw a group of 3 skunks, and one of them bit her foot. The animal has tested positive for rabies.

People with questions about whether they need treatment can contact the state health department at 617-983-5800.

[2] Wisconsin: bat, canine exposure
Date: Fri 2 Aug 2013
Source: Fond du Lac (FDL) Reporter [edited]

Jeanna Giese had a sense of deja vu Tuesday morning [30 Jul 2013] when she spotted a small, brown object lying in the enclosure that holds 2 of her 3 Siberian huskies. Using a shovel to get a closer look, the Fond du Lac woman saw a bat, it's small body covered with bite marks from the dogs.

"We double-bagged the bat and had my vet send it to Madison to have it tested," she said. "I was hoping that the bat wouldn't test positive for rabies, that it was just another small animal the dogs had gotten a hold of."

A phone call from the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene the next day confirmed Giese's suspicions.

"How many people in the entire world can honestly say that a rabid bat has affected their lives twice in 9 years?" asked Giese, who attracted national attention after contracting rabies herself in 2004 when she was bitten by a rabid bat at Fond du Lac's St Patrick's Catholic Church.

The 24-year-old was the 1st person in history to survive the rabies virus without having had a rabies vaccine.

Since witnessing a sled dog demonstration in 8th grade, Giese was determined to give the sport a try. First she had to have a sled dog. She acquired her 1st Siberian husky, Mayah, from a breeder outside of Waupun [Wisconsin]. With a bit of wheedling, she convinced her parents to add 2 more huskies -- Asher and, most recently, Shai -- to her collection.

"I had to push a little bit, but eventually I won them over," she said with a laugh. "But these dogs are like my kids. I would do anything for them."

Although Mayah was not in the pen with the bat, Giese took no chances and transported her along with the 2 males to St Bernard's Animal Medical Center in Van Dyne [Wisconsin] for blood work and their rabies booster shots. All of her dogs were vaccinated against rabies at the time of the exposure.

"With my past and doing all the presentations I do on dog safety and rabies, I had the bat tested. I set up an appointment with my veterinarian, Dr Kim Everson, to have the dogs vaccinated right away. I'm not taking any chances," she said. "I'm just glad that they didn't eat the bat, otherwise I might not have known that they had been exposed."

Since the dogs were vaccinated at the time of exposure, they will need to be quarantined for 60 days to comply with state statutes. "Had they not been previously vaccinated or had the vaccinations not been up-to-date, the dogs would have to be quarantined 160 days," said St Bernard's Head Veterinarian Technician Tim Kneeland. "The virus can remain latent or hidden for up to 6 months before symptoms begin to show."

The 3 dogs will remain quarantined at Giese's Fond du Lac home. The confinement is bound to put a dent in the Fond du Lac woman's dog sled training schedule. "I had hoped to get them out on the trails at the Siberian Outpost near Malone in a couple of weeks," she said.

Her encounter with a rabid bat adds another chapter to Giese's unique rabies story. Since her brush with the deadly virus she has been an advocate for animals and an educator about the dangers of rabies.

During her presentation to school children on the dangers of rabies she speaks specifically about dog safety.

"It's not surprising people know little about rabies -- I didn't," Giese said. "You can't walk into a counselor's office and just pick up a pamphlet about rabies. I'm teaching kids that it's out there and what to do. Had I known what I know now, I would have made a different decision (about picking up the bat in 2004)."

Giese emphasizes the importance of vaccinating household pets for the disease even if they are considered "inside pets." "People don't realize that small animals like bats, chipmunks, or squirrels can get into your house and that your cat can escape outside and you have no idea where it's been," she said. "And if your animals are outside, you need to supervise them."

Giese feels her unique perspective is helping to send the message home. "Being able to use my personal history makes more of an impact than just some random person telling them to stay away from wild animals," Giese said. "It's part of my past. That helps to deliver the message a little better. And the latest incident with my dogs just adds another chapter."

Ironically, her unfortunate experiences with bats haven't soured her relationship with the small, furry mammals. Giese still wears her signature bat necklace and plans to attend a bat festival in Michigan this fall [2013].

She is also closely following the spread of white nose bat syndrome that is decimating the bat population across the United States.

"My passion for animals hasn't changed even though another rabid bat has entered my life," said Giese who still experiences residual neurological effects from her exposure to rabies 9 years ago. "It's nothing that's prevented me from doing most of the things I love."

[3] Virginia: bat, human exposure
Date: Wed 31 Jul 2013

http://www.wusa9.com/news/article/268749/158/Several-teens-possibly-exposed-to-Rabies-after-touching-bat


Officials are worried that several teens were exposed to rabies in Sterling, Virginia. They came in contact with an injured or dead bat, officials said. The call came in on 23 Jul 2013, about an injured or dead bat at the Potomack Lakes Sportsplex at 20280 Cascades Parkway, officials said. Loudoun County Health Department officials are now asking the people who may have touched the bat to be tested and possibly treated for rabies immediately.

Rabies is a deadly disease that attacks the nervous system. "Exposure to rabies is considered any time there is a bite or scratch, or other circumstance where saliva or central nervous system tissue from a rabid or potentially rabid animal enters an open, fresh wound or comes in contact with a mucous membrane by entering the eye, mouth, or nose," officials said in a news release.

If you have any questions or concerns call 703-771-5829.

[4] North Dakota: feline, human exposure
Date: Thu 1 Aug 2013

An 18-year old Jamestown woman was visiting a friend's house near Montpelier, North Dakota, on Saturday [27 Jul 2013] when she noticed a kitten at the house. Sgt Liz Kapp of the Stutsman County Sheriff's Office said the 18 year old told her the kitten looked like it was thirsty.

When the 18 year old came home Saturday [27 Jul 2013] she told her mother about the incident. The 18 year old's mother, said when her daughter placed some water in front of the kitten it bit her left thumb. "We went back to find the kitten on Monday night [29 Jul 2013], and it was dead," the mother said. "My daughter was devastated that the kitten had died."

The women took the kitten to the Southwood Veterinary Clinic Tuesday morning [30 Jul 2013] in Jamestown to see if it had any diseases, like rabies. The mother said they were told by the clinic staff that the kitten's body was too decomposed to conduct any tests.

This was not good news for the daughter. As a precaution, the teen's doctor is giving her the treatment for rabies, which is a series of 11 shots over a period of 14 days. The 1st day of shots, known as "day zero," is probably the worst, according to the mother. The daughter received 4 shots in the area of her wound, then one shot in each arm and leg.

"She [the daughter] will now get one shot in the arm on days 3, 7, and 14," [the mother] said.

[5] Texas: bat, human exposure
Date: Wed 31 Jul 2013

http://www.kxan.com/dpp/news/local/austin/officials-look-for-man-who-touched-headless-bat


Health officials are trying to track down a man who handled a headless bat presumably positive for rabies.

The man, around 40 years old, touched the decapitated bat Thursday evening [25 Jul 2013] on the hiking trail near the bat observation area on the south side of the Ann Richards' bridge, according to Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department officials.

They submitted the bat to the Department of State Health Services lab, but a necropsy could not be performed because the animal wasn't intact. However, it is presumed to be positive for rabies. [A necropsy could have been performed, but the state lab in this case is focused on determining if the animal had rabies, for which the head is required. - Mod.TG]

Public health crews are needing to find the man who handled the bat so that they can talk to him about the potential exposure to rabies.

The man is described as having a medium build, and has white-and-gray hair. Anyone with information is asked to call the Disease Surveillance Program at 512-972-5555.

Rabies exposure happens only when a person is bitten or scratched by a potentially rabid animal, or when abrasions, open wounds, or mucous membranes are contaminated with the saliva, brain, or nervous system tissue of a potentially rabid animal.

It may take several weeks or longer for people to show symptoms after being infected with rabies.

The early signs of rabies can be fever or headache, but this changes quickly to nervous system signs such as confusion, sleepiness, or agitation.

Once someone with a rabies infection starts having these symptoms, that person usually does not survive. This is why it is critical to talk to your doctor or health care provider right away if any animal bites you, especially a wild animal.

[The most unique story is about the woman who survived rabies and is now an advocate to prevent rabies.

However, most of these stories issue a plea for being careful around animals you don't know, that dead animals may still be a danger to you, and above all, to have your animals vaccinated. The 2nd story involving the woman who survived rabies shows she was extremely responsible in taking care of her dogs: making sure they were current on the vaccine and revaccinating and quarantining in accordance with her state's law.

Rabies is not a disease to take lightly. It is a dangerous killer. - Mod.TG]
