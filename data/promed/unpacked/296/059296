South Africa's use of controversial pesticide DDT has helped it achieve a
huge reduction in malaria cases over the past 5 years, the health minister
said on Thursday. DDT is effective in killing malaria-spreading mosquitoes
but is blamed for deaths, cancer and birth defects and is outlawed by the
Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, except when used for
disease control.
South Africa stopped using the insecticide in 1996 due to international
pressure but re-introduced it 4 years later after other insecticides were
found to be less effective due to drug resistance.
"This change in insecticide was one of the main contributing factors to the
decline in malaria cases in the past 5 years in South Africa," Health
Minister Mantombazana Tshabalala-Msimang said in written reply to a
parliamentary question. "South Africa has reduced malaria morbidity and
mortality by approximately 88 percent and 86 percent, respectively,
compared to the year 2000," she said.
Official data show the country had 7754 reported cases of malaria and 64
deaths from the disease in 2005 compared to 64 622 cases and 438 deaths in
2000.
Tshabalala-Msimang said South Africa was aware of the controversy around
the use of DDT for malaria control and invested heavily in training staff
to use the chemical safely. "For this reason DDT is used judiciously
strictly for public health reasons and its application is on the inside
walls of houses and under the eaves of mud structures," she added.

[Many malaria vectors, especially the principal ones in sub-Saharan Africa,
_Anopheles gambiae_ and An. _funestus_, rest, both before and after
feeding on humans, in human habitations. Consequently in the 1950s and
1960s spraying the interior surfaces of houses with DDT eradicated malaria
over much of southern Europe, and this approach was used commonly in Africa
until the late 1970s. But its widespread use in agriculture caused deaths
of fish, birds and other non-target organisms and this environmental damage
was instrumental in DDT becoming banned in many countries.
But I would stress that it was the agricultural applications of DDT that
caused it to be banned for virtually all uses in many countries, and not
its use in house spraying. As a result, despite the relatively small amount
of environmental damage caused in malaria control activities, DDT was
phased out of malaria control/eradication campaigns in Africa and
elsewhere. This was a great pity because DDT was, and remains, an extremely
safe insecticide, its acute toxicity being less than that of most
alternative insecticides such as the organophosphate and carbamates that
usually replaced it in house-spraying.
Several African countries such as South Africa, Swaziland, Ethiopia, Kenya,
Uganda and Tanzania are now successfully using DDT to halt the rise in
malaria cases that followed the cessation of DDT house spraying. DDT is
cheap and its effects are longer-lasting than most alternative
insecticides, so that houses need only be sprayed once or twice a year
depending on the transmission season. This reduces labour costs. Now USA
government officials are endorsing and also funding the use of DDT for
controlling malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, whereas for many years despite
scientists declaring that DDT was just about the best weapon against
malaria, the USA was against its use in malaria control/eradication
programs. Nevertheless some environmentalists are against its use in
fighting malaria, and this can create heated controversy.
Although the use of DDT in malaria programs still remains somewhat
controversial, mainly for environmentalists, it saves human lives,
especially those of young children, and I back its re-introduction into
the fight against malaria. - Mod.MS]
[DDT is an effective insecticide against indoor-resting mosquitoes. The
main advantages are that DDT remains effective for months on the wall after
application and DDT is cheap. DDT was used widely from the end of WWII up
to the 1970s, when concern grew over long-term accumulation in mammals
including man and high concentrations in the milk of lactating mothers in
areas where it was used for regular, indoor house spraying.
Malaria is a disease of poverty and using DDT will be effective -- but
long-term use is problematic when malaria comes under control and the
environmental problems become more important. Better housing including the
use of window screens, use of impregnated bed nets and surveillance and
prompt treatment of malaria patients will sustain control in the long term.
