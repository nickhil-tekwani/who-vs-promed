First report of Beet virus Q in Belgium.

Neuve, Belgium. Plant Dis. 85:1288, 2001; published on-line as D-2001-
1002-02N, 2001. Accepted for publication 10 Sep 2001.
Beet necrotic yellow vein [beny]virus (BNYVV), the causal agent of
rhizomania disease on sugar beet, has been reported in Belgium for
more than 16 years. Other soilborne viruses belonging to the genus
Pomovirus, such as Beet soilborne virus (BSBV) (3) and Beet virus Q
(BVQ) (1), are suspected pathogens of sugar beets grown in Belgium.
During ... 2000, ... more than 20 fields showing rhizomania-like and
yellowing symptoms on sugar beet leaves were investigated for the
presence of BVQ, BNYVV, and BSBV. All samples were checked by
ELISA ... using commercial BNYVV (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur,
Marnes-La-Coquette, France) and BSBV/BVQ (DSMZ, Braunschweig,
Germany - AS-0576 polyclonal, AS-0576/2 MAb) antisera.
RNA was extracted from sugar beet rootlets using an RNeasy extraction
kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), before performing a ... RT-PCR using
primers (5'-GCTGGAGTATATCACCGATGAC-3' and 5'-
AAAATCTCGGATAGCATCCAAC-3') designed to specifically
amplify a 510-bp region of BVQ RNA-1. The presence of BSBV and
BNYVV was also checked by RT-PCR using previously described
primers (1,2).
The [nucleotide sequence of the] BVQ-derived PCR product was more
than 99% identical to [that of] the Wierthe BVQ isolate... . Soil
transmission of BVQ was demonstrated [by] ... a bioassay using [soil
diluted with varying amounts of quartz] and sugar beet cv. Cadyx as
bait. After 6 weeks, BVQ was detected by RT-PCR in bait plants.
The putative vector, _Polymyxa betae_, was identified by lactophenol-
cotton blue staining of the roots followed by microscopic examination.
BVQ produces irregularly shaped local lesions that appear [about] 5
days after mechanical inoculation and tend to spread along veins.
BVQ was detected in 6 fields located in the Polders Region and Brabant
Province of Belgium. [It] ... was always found in sugar beet samples
coinfected with BNYVV and BSBV. The economic significance of
BVQ and its interaction with other viruses is [unknown].

[BVQ was first discovered in a sugarbeet plant co-infected with
BNYVV near Braunschweig, Germany in the late 1980's and has
subsequently been detected throughout Germany and in other
countries. BVQ is one of 4 species in the newly defined Pomovirus
genus; other members are Beet soilborne, Broad bean necrosis, and
Potato mop-top viruses. All except BBNV are known to be transmitted
by soilborne fungi, although the amino acid sequences of the RNA-
dependent RNA polymerase and capsid protein of BBNV are closely
related to those of PMTV suggesting, perhaps, that BBNV may be
vectored by a soilborne fungus. BSBV and PMTV are transmitted by
the soil-inhabiting fungi, _P. betae_ and _Spongospora subterranea_,
respectively. Pomoviruses can survive in thick-walled resting spores of
these fungi for several years, thus providing an inoculum for infection
of susceptible crops in subsequent crop years.
