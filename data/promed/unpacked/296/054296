Notes from the Field: Outbreak of multidrug-resistant _Salmonella_ infections linked to pork -- Washington, 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Kawakami VM, Bottichio L, Angelo K, et al]

During June-July 2015, Public Health-Seattle & King County (PHSKC) and Washington State Department of Health (WADOH) investigated 22 clusters of _Salmonella [enterica_] serotype I 4,[5], 12:i:- infections. Serotype I 4,[5], 12:i:- is the 5th most frequently reported _Salmonella_ serotype in the USA, but is uncommon in Washington. On 29 Jul 2015, WADOH and PHSKC requested assistance from CDC to identify the infection source, determine risk factors, and make recommendations for prevention.

A confirmed case was initially defined as a gastrointestinal illness with onset during 25 Apr - 25 Sep 2015, with documentation of a _Salmonella_ serotype I 4,[5], 12:i:- isolate from 1 of 5 closely related pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) XbaI patterns (JPXX01.1314, JPXX01.2311, JPXX01.2429, JPXX01.3161, or JPXX01.3336) in a Washington resident, or with an isolate matching one of the outbreak PFGE patterns with highly related whole genome sequencing, in a non-Washington resident. Later in the investigation, an additional PFGE XbaI pattern (JFXX01.0046) was added to the case definition.

A total of 192 confirmed cases were reported from 5 states; 184 (96 percent) occurred in Washington (Figure [available at the source URL above. - Mod.LL]). Patients ranged in age from less than 1 to 90 years (median=35 years), and 97 (51 percent) were female. Among 180 patients for whom information about hospitalization was available, 30 (17 percent) were hospitalized; no deaths were reported.

On the basis of cases investigated before August 2015, a supplemental questionnaire that went into more detail in addressing meat and livestock exposures was developed. Among 80 patients (42 percent of all confirmed cases) who were interviewed, 59 (74 percent) reported eating pork during the 7 days preceding illness. This was significantly higher than the most recently published (2007) Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) population survey of healthy persons, in which 43 percent reported eating pork in the week before they were interviewed (p less than 0.001) (1).

WADOH and PHSKC investigation into the source of pork traced the pork consumed by 35 (59 percent) of the 59 interviewed patients who reported eating pork back to a US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service-inspected pork slaughter establishment in Graham, Washington. During the outbreak period, the establishment distributed whole hogs and pork parts, primarily from 5 farms in Montana and one in Washington, to Washington, Oregon, and Alaska. Among the 21 interviewed patients who did not report consuming pork before becoming ill, 13 had eaten at 1 of 2 restaurants or had shopped at one market where pork from the establishment was served. During June and July 2015, PHSKC inspections of these 3 facilities identified potential opportunities for cross-contamination of raw pork with other meat and produce, including inadequate employee hand washing and insufficient cleaning and sanitization of food contact surfaces and utensils used for raw meat. Food and environmental sampling by PHSKC at all three facilities yielded the outbreak strains.

Of 11 pooled environmental samples collected on 31 Jul 2015, from the slaughter establishment by WADOH, 8 yielded one of the outbreak strains. A parallel Food Safety and Inspection Service investigation of the establishment, conducted during 10-14 Aug 2015, cited insanitary conditions, supported by isolation of outbreak strains from samples taken before the start of daily operations, consistent with WADOH results. Additionally, the Food Safety and Inspection Service isolated Salmonella Infantis (XbaI pattern JFXX01.0046) from the establishment, which was subsequently added to the case definition. 4 patients (2 percent of all confirmed cases) were identified using the updated case definition. On 13 Aug 2015, the establishment recalled an estimated 116 262 pounds [52 736 kg] of whole hogs produced during 18 Apr-27 Jul 2015, and on 27 Aug 2015, expanded the recall to include approximately 523 380 pounds [237 401 kg] of pork products produced during 18 Apr-26 Aug 2015 because of potential contamination with _Salmonella_ I 4,[5], 12:i:- (2). On 27 Aug 2016, the slaughter establishment voluntarily ceased operations.

A total of 10 clinical isolates of the outbreak strains from Washington were submitted to CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System for resistance testing. All 10 exhibited resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline (ASSuT resistance). In 2009, the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System reported less than 1.5 percent of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5], 12:i:- human isolates had the ASSuT resistance pattern; in 2013, this number had increased to 45.5 percent (3). Regarding future _Salmonella_ I 4,[5], 12:i:- outbreaks, increasing ASSuT resistance is concerning because infections with antimicrobial-resistant _Salmonella_ strains are associated with an increased risk for hospitalization, bloodstream infection, and treatment failure (4,5). Further study of the epidemiology and etiology of ASSuT resistance and _Salmonella_ I 4,[5], 12:i:- is recommended.

This was the largest salmonellosis outbreak in Washington in recent history, and highlights that pork is an important source for human salmonellosis (6). Best practices in all parts of the pork production industry, from farm to processing plant, can help reduce the risk for future outbreaks (7). In addition, prevention strategies that include rigorous Salmonella control in pork slaughter establishments in conjunction with food handling education at the wholesaler and restaurant level should be strengthened.

[This MMWR report is an excellent example of the evaluation of a foodborne outbreak of an enteric pathogen and underscores that swine can be a significant reservoir for salmonellosis and that restaurants can cross-contaminate meats.

The outbreak strain is _Salmonella_ I, 4, 5, 12:i: -, a designation discussed by Ana Paccagnella (supervisor of the Enteric Bacteriology Section at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control) http://www.bcfpa.net/Attachments/Presentations/Conference2005/Naming%20Salmonella%20(A%20Paccagnella)%2008%20Nov%2005.pdf:

_Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.

The designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:
- the "I" reflects subspecies _enterica_;
- the "4, 12" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. It should be noted that serotype Typhimurium carries somatic antigens 4, 5 and 12 (the group B antigens). Paccagnella pointed out to me in an email that an O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not.
- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i: 1,2, reflects the flagellar or H antigens. It is these H antigens that define the serotype identity within an individual group of salmonellae.

Almost all of these organisms are biphasic in regard to the H antigens, that is, they can switch from one flagellar antigen to another; as an example, _S._ Typhimurium is I 4, 5, 12:i:1,2. - Mod.LL
