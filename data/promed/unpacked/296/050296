In Mogilev city a mass catching of stray animals has begun. It is connected
with the report of a rabies case among animals - for the first time during
last 10 years. Eugeny Melnikov, a Deputy Head of the Mogilev municipality
(Gorispolkom) informed journalists that [the] infected animal is a domestic
cat. At present all members of the family, where the cat lived, are under
medical observation and have [received] a pre-exposure prophylactic
treatment. [The] last time a case of rabies was reported in Mogilev [city
was] in 1988. But in Mogilev province (oblast) 12 cases of rabies were
reported only last year. They were [in] cats, foxes, wolves and even cows.
