Hepatitis E virus in pigs in the UK and other industrialized countries
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Spain [see: Hepatitis E, porcine carriers - Spain 20070215.0561]
is, together with Germany, the largest European producer of pork meat.
The following additional reference from the Veterinary Record of 10
Feb 2007; Vol. 160 - No. 6:202, discusses the prevalence of hepatitis
E virus in European Union countries and elsewhere.
Title: Transmission of hepatitis E virus. M. Banks (1), S. Grierson
(1), H.J. Fellows (2), W. Stableforth (2), R. Bendall (2), and H.R.
Dalton (2); at (1) VLA - Weybridge, Addlestone, New Haw, Surrey KT15
3NB, and (2) Royal Cornwall Hospital, Truro, Cornwall TR1 3LJ.
"Hepatitis E caused by the enterically transmitted hepatitis E virus
(HEV) is a major public health problem in many developing regions of
the world. There is now a substantial body of direct and indirect
evidence, emerging from autochthonously acquired cases of hepatitis E
in industrialized regions, indicating that HEV can be transmitted
zoonotically. With the exception of pigs and sika deer, there is very
little evidence for zoonotic transmission from other mammals, and the
ubiquitous nature of HEV in global pig populations has contributed to
the evidence that pigs represent the most likely reservoir for
zoonotic transmission.
In general, in the UK and in many other industrialized regions, the
highest sequence homologies to the autochthonously acquired human
strains of HEV are not seen in human strains of other countries, but
are closest to those detected in the respective national pig herds.
In some cases this homology can be 100 percent at the amino acid
level (Banks et al. 2004). Although many potential transmission
routes have been suggested, the most direct evidence for zoonotic
transmission involves ingestion of HEV-infected uncooked or poorly
cooked meat (Tei et al. 2003).
PCR [polymerase chain reaction] studies in Japan (Yazaki et al. 2003)
and in the Netherlands (Bouwknegt et al. 2007) detected HEV in 3 of
197 (1.5 percent) and 4 of 62 (6.5 percent) of retail pig livers
respectively. The demonstration that HEV may be viable in rare-cooked
pig meat (Emerson et al. 2005) adds further credence to this
potential route of zoonotic transmission.
As part of an investigation into autochthonously acquired hepatitis E
in Cornwall (England), samples of pig liver were collected from 80
retail outlets in that county. Samples were anonymised and submitted
to the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) in Weybridge for testing.
A PCR using degenerate primers was used to detect HEV in the samples.
In contrast to the findings in Japan and the Netherlands, none of the
pig liver samples from Cornwall proved positive for HEV.
Although this result cannot be used as an indicator of national
freedom from HEV in retail pig livers, and no attempts were made to
source the farm origins of the pig samples, it does indicate that in
Cornwall at least, exposure to HEV via pig liver is likely to be low.
This leaves the likely routes of transmission for the 21 cases of
autochthonously acquired hepatitis E in the county [Cornwall] in
recent years (Dalton et al. 2007) undetermined.
It would be useful to conduct a nationally representative survey of
HEV in retail pig livers in order to assess more completely this
potential transmission route in the UK. This would enable a better
focus on studies of the increasing number of autochthonously acquired
cases of hepatitis E diagnosed in southwest England and other regions
of the UK, in almost all of which the transmission route remains
unknown. In addition, use of in vitro cultivation methods for HEV
would give greater significance to the risks associated with HEV
PCR-positive pig products."

[HEV is associated in humans with outbreaks of enterically
transmitted acute hepatitis. HEV is similar to viruses belonging to
the family _Caliciviridae_ (the noroviruses and their ilk), but
biologically distinct. HEV is considered to be endemic as a
disease-producing agent in semi-tropical and tropical regions,
whereas antibody prevalence surveys suggest a global distribution of
the virus, perhaps in a less pathogenic form.
HEV exists as a single serotype with extensive cross-reactivity among
circulating human and swine strains. Cross-reactive antibodies with
epitopes of human strains have been detected in numerous rodents and
other mammals but the putative viruses have not been isolated.
Four distinct genotypes of HEV have been defined. The HEV strains
identified in swine are closely related antigenically and genetically
to human HEV genotypes 3 and 4 strains. Interspecies transmission of
genotype 3 strains between swine and primates has been demonstrated
experimentally but evidence of natural transmission is lacking.
The above research paper by Banks et al. records the prevalence of
HEV in southwest England, but leaves unresolved the question of the
source of the virus and its route of transmission.
