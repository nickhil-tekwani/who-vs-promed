"Three elderly people have died as a result of being infected by _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Thompson. In total, some 950 people have now been taken ill as a result of the salmon, which have been taken off the shelves," said the National Institute for Public Health (RIVM) in the Netherlands.

Dutch food and consumer watchdog NVWA [Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority] rang alarm bells earlier in October 2012, pinning the outbreak on Dutch fish producer Foppen and advising all major Dutch supermarket chains to take the contaminated salmon off the shelves. The RIVM added that around 100 people in the USA were also infected "by the same type of salmonella."

Foppen, headquartered in the central Dutch town of Harderwijk in the meantime blamed a contaminated production line in Greece for the outbreak, Dutch media reported.

A California-based company in April [2012] issued a recall of 58 828 pounds (26 683 kilograms) of a ground fish product known as "tuna scrape," imported to the USA from India, after salmonellosis sickened 116 people.

[Now more than 900 cases with at least 3 deaths have been reported in this impressive outbreak of _S._ Thompson in the Netherlands. Since salmonellae are not usually found in fish, as in past outbreaks, contamination is likely to have occurred after harvesting the fish.

Mortality related to non-typhoid salmonellosis is higher in the very young, the elderly, and individuals who are immunocompromised cellularly.
