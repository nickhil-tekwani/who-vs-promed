1st Report of _Erwinia persicina_ from _Phaseolus vulgaris_ in Spain
--------------------------------------------------------------------

33300 Villaviciosa, Asturias. Spain; JC Tello, M de Cara, Departamento de
Produccion Vegetal. Universidad de Almeria, 04120 Almeria, Spain. Plant Dis
2005; 89: 109, published online as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-0109C, 2005. Accepted
for publication 20 Oct 2004.
A previously unreported leaf spot disease of common bean, which caused crop
losses as high as 50 per cent, was observed in south eastern Spain
(Almeria, Granada, and Malaga provinces) in November 2003.
In 2004, samples of cv. Donna with chlorotic and necrotic leaf spots were
collected from Granada and processed for microbiological analysis. Bacteria
isolated from the symptomatic leaves were determined to be fermentative on
the basis of the ability to metabolize glucose in aerobic and anaerobic
conditions.
3 isolates were selected for pathogenicity tests. Bacterial suspensions
(100 million CFU/ml) were spray-inoculated on bean seedlings (3 true
leaves) of cv. Andecha. Beans were covered with transparent plastic bags
for 2 days and held in an incubation chamber at 22 deg C and 80 per cent
relative humidity with a 12-h photoperiod. Assays were repeated at least twice.
Symptoms that developed on plants inoculated with the 3 isolates were
similar to those originally observed, while symptoms did not occur on
control plants (inoculated with distilled water).
The pathogenic isolates were identified by sequencing of the 16S rDNA after
amplification (1). The amplified sequences were compared with available DNA
sequences in databases by using BLAST (2); 99 per cent homology with 16S
rDNA of _Erwinia persicina_ was shown. Microbiological characteristics
(gram staining, motility, morphology, and results of biochemical tests)
were in agreement with the molecular identification of the isolates.
_E. persicina_ has been isolated from bean in the United States (3) and
described on tomato, banana, and cucumber in Japan (4).
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _E. persicina_ from common bean
in Spain and in Europe.

There is not much information about _Erwinia persicinus_ (now _Erwinia
persicina_, [Ep]) since it was first described in 1990 after being isolated
from a variety of fruits and vegetables, including bananas, cucumbers, and
tomatoes. In 1994, Ep was shown to be the causative agent of necrosis of
bean pods and was also reported to be the 1st human isolate of Ep. The
strain was isolated from the urine of an 88 year old woman who presented
with a urinary tract infection. By the hydroxyapatite method, DNA from this
strain was shown to be 94.5 per cent related at 60 deg C and 86 per cent
related at 75 deg C to the type strain of Ep. The biochemical profile of Ep
is most similar to those of 2 plant pathogens, _Erwinia rhapontici_ and
_Pantoea agglomerans_, and species of _Enterobacter_. It is negative in
tests for lysine, arginine, ornithine, dulcitol, and urea and is motile and
positive in tests for D-sorbitol and sucrose. It is susceptible to the
expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones,
but it is resistant to ampicillin, ticarcillin, and cefazolin. There have
been several other bacterial plant pathogens reported to be involved in
human infections.
