[While reporting of newly confirmed cases, fatalities, and recoveries has been somewhat delayed, it appears as though there is now a clear pattern of presentation of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia -- with a background endemic pattern, primarily "primary" cases with either a history of contact with camels or an unidentified history of high-risk exposure, and the occasional cases in household contacts or limited nosocomial transmission. In this current report, there were 6 newly confirmed cases during the period 2-17 Apr 2018, coming from 4 different regions (Najran - 2 cases, Makkah - 2 cases, and 1 each from Riyadh and Ash Sharq朝yah - Eastern regions). Cases included 5 primary cases of whom 2 had a history of direct contact with camels, and 1 household contact.

Maps showing the locations of the cases can be found at the source URLs.

MERS superspreader study highlights risk in cardiac, renal patients
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Difficulty distinguishing pneumonia from volume overload in a patient with renal failure delayed a MERS-CoV diagnosis at a Riyadh hospital last year [2017], which led to a superspreading event that sickened 44 people at 3 health facilities, Saudi researchers reported in the American Journal of Infection Control.

In their detailed report on the outbreak and its spread, the group said the lessons they learned could help fine-tune protocols for screening for the MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in emergency departments (EDs).

The index patient was a 46-year-old Yemeni man with underlying health conditions including diabetes, hypertension, and asthma, who came into the ED [emergency department] at Riyadh's King Saud Medical City with respiratory symptoms without fever and a recent history of diarrhea. His chest radiograph suggested pulmonary edema, and his blood tests showed evidence of acute kidney failure that required urgent dialysis.

After 2 dialysis sessions, his pulmonary edema improved, but his respiratory symptoms didn't. He spent 14 hours in the crowded multi-bed ED before he was admitted to an inpatient room, which he shared with 4 other patients. 2 days later, he experienced respiratory distress, requiring intubation and admission to the intensive care unit, where samples were obtained that tested positive for MERS-CoV. He was taken to another hospital in Riyadh that serves as the MERS-CoV regional reference center, where he died 22 days after admission.

An investigation at the 1st hospital identified 120 contacts, 109 of them healthcare workers, who had direct unprotected exposure to the man. 16 people tested positive for MERS-CoV, including 5 nurses, 3 physicians, 1 paramedic, and 7 patients, 1 of which was a patient at the 2nd hospital. The eventual total for the 3 simultaneous hospital clusters was 44 cases, 11 of them fatal.

The group concluded that problems identifying pneumonia in people with renal and cardiac failure can delay suspicion for MERS-CoV, along with delays in proper infection control steps. They said the report confirmed the need to rule out the disease in such patients and that a rapid point-of-care test is urgently needed to help ED triage teams identify the disease sooner and prevent major outbreaks.

Amer H, Alqahtani AS, Alzoman H, Aljerian N, Memish ZA. Unusual presentation of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus leading to a large outbreak in Riyadh during 2017. Am J Infect Control. 2018. pii: S0196-6553(18)30146-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ajic.2018.02.023; abstract available at http://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(18)30146-9/abstract

Abstract
--------
"Highlights
-----------
- HCF [healthcare facility] outbreaks of MERS-CoV continue to happen but with lower frequency and size.
- Outbreaks are being ignited with unusual challenging cases that are difficult to pick up in emergency room (CRF [chronic renal failure] and chronic heart disease).
- Superspreading events are multifactorial with host, virus, and environment playing key role.
- Point of care testing is the highest priority in limiting such cases in the future.

"Background
-----------
"The hallmark of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) disease is the ability to cause major health care-associated nosocomial outbreaks with superspreading events leading to massive numbers of cases and excessive morbidity and mortality. In this report, we describe a patient who presented with acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis and became a MERS-CoV superspreader, igniting a recent multihospital outbreak in Riyadh.

"Material and results
---------------------
"Between May 31 and June 15, 2017, 44 cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported from 3 simultaneous clusters from 3 health care facilities in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, including 11 fatal cases. Out of the total reported cases, 29 cases were reported from King Saud Medical City. The cluster at King Saud Medical City was ignited by a single superspreader patient who presented with acute renal failure. After 14 hours in the open area of the emergency department and 2 hemodialysis sessions he was diagnosed with MERS-CoV. 120 contacts who had direct unprotected exposure were screened. Among those contacts, 9 out of 107 health care workers (5 nurses, 3 physicians, and 1 paramedic) and 7 out of 13 patients tested positive for MERS-CoV.

"Conclusions
------------
"This hospital outbreak demonstrated the difficulties in diagnosing pneumonia in patients with renal and cardiac failure, which leads to delayed suspicion of MERS-CoV and hence delay in applying the proper infection control procedures. In MERS-CoV endemic countries there is an urgent need for developing rapid point-of-care testing that would assist emergency department staff in triaging suspected cases of MERS-CoV to ensure timely isolation and management of their primary illness and prevent major MERS-CoV outbreaks."

This is not the 1st instance of delayed diagnosis leading to a large sized outbreak. The outbreak in South Korea, involving 186 cases was the result of delayed diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection in an individual who was a superspreader. The authors note that while there is a high vigilance for MERS-CoV in KSA (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia), there is a low level of suspicion for MERS-CoV infection in patients presenting with congestive heart failure and renal failure, thereby contributing to the observed nosocomial clustering when these patients are "mainstreamed" in emergency rooms and wards, as seen in this descriptive study (and also seen with the outbreak in South Korea).

The conclusion on the part of the authors for the need for a rapid point-of-care testing for use in the emergency department is right on target and would be helpful in identifying known respiratory agents associated with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI). Given the past history with SARS-CoV, and now with MERS-CoV, it is clear that should another respiratory coronavirus appear, in the absence of a consistent emergency room practice for routine respiratory isolation of patients presenting with pneumonias and/or respiratory failure, history would most likely repeat itself again, with the emergency room and healthcare facility serving as areas of enhanced nosocomial transmission of the new respiratory virus. - Mod.MPP]
