Indonesia: More suspected bird flu patients in South Sulawesi
-----------------------------------------------
Four suspected bird flu patients were admitted on Tue 23 Jan 2007 to
Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital in Makassar, South Sulawesi, raising
the number of patients treated there to 5 within 2 days. The 5,
including 3 children -- one 11 years old, one 2 years old, and one 22
months old -- come from the same area, namely Tamamaung village in
Panakkukang district, Makassar.

They were sent to the hospital after coming down with similar
symptoms: a high fever and breathing problems. A team of doctors
treating the patients said quick test results found that one was
infected with influenza virus type A, the species to which avian flu
viruses [and seasonal influenza viruses - Mod.CP] belong. Team member
Bob Wahyudi said the test results could not be taken to mean that the
patient had bird flu, however.

The team has sent blood and mucus samples to Jakarta to determine
whether the patient has the disease. "We are still waiting for the
results of the laboratory tests," Bob said.

In Semarang, Central Java, a 22-month-old baby was rushed to an
isolation room at Kariadi Hospital on Monday [22 Jan 2007] night with
a suspected infection of bird flu. The baby is the son of a
26-year-old resident of Bambankerep in Ngaliyan district, Semarang.
The [parent] had been admitted to the hospital earlier on Monday for
similar symptoms.

Besides these 2, the hospital is treating a 51-year-old resident of
Bangunharjo, Semarang. Another suspected bird flu patient treated at
the hospital has recovered and gone home. Hussein Gasem, head of
Kariadi Hospital's Infectious Disease Emergency Team, said family
members had disclosed that the [parent] had close contact with
poultry before coming down with a high fever and cough. "Before being
admitted to the hospital, the [22-month-old son] had suffered from a
high fever, with a temperature reaching 39 C, for 3 days. He was
briefly treated at Tugu Hospital before being sent to Kariadi
Hospital," Hussein said. The team is also awaiting the results of
blood and mucus tests from Jakarta. "It will take up to 3 days to get
the results," he said.

Meanwhile, an order from the central government to cull fowl infected
with the bird flu virus to help prevent the spread of the deadly
disease has gotten mixed responses from regional administrations in
West Java. A number of regencies said it was difficult to conduct
mass culls due to the limited availability of funds to compensate
owners and the absence of necessary regulations.

Regions which have not begun culling include Cirebon mayoralty,
Cirebon regency and Indramayu regency. "We will wait for a
gubernatorial decree. It's difficult for us to implement the culling
without being backed up by a legal instrument," Heri Rinaldi of the
Cirebon Animal Husbandry Office said Monday [22 Jan 2007].

While waiting for the decree to be issued, Heri said that his office
had deployed vaccination teams to villages. "At least 370 vaccination
officers have been sent to the villages to launch mass vaccination
activities and spread information on the need to maintain sanitation
around poultry breeding hatches," he said. West Java legislators and
officials of the provincial livestock husbandry office are also
questioning a decrease in the supply of bird flu vaccine from the
central government at a time when the virus is spreading. This year
[2007], West Java needed more than 90 million doses of vaccine to
protect about 33 million chickens, birds and ducks, but the central
government gave it only 10 million doses, said legislator Syarief
Bastaman in Bandung on Tuesday [23 Jan 2007]. That was a drop from
the 18 million doses sent out last year [2006], he added. In 2005, he
said, West Java got 24 million doses. "We're asking, why is that? The
government reduces the supply when it's really needed," Syarief said.
Nana M. Adnan of the West Java Livestock Husbandry Office said at
least Rp 24 billion [US 2.52 million] was needed to buy the other 76
million doses of vaccine.
