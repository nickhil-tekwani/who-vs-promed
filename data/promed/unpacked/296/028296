How long does immunity last against Ebola?
------------------------------------------
The tracking of antibodies in Ebola survivors suggests they wax and wane, which could make vaccine booster shots necessary.

A new outbreak of Ebola in Guinea has prompted international concern. It was among the worst affected West African countries during the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic, which resulted in more than 28 000 cases and 11 000 deaths in the region. Things are a little different this time around: health teams in West Africa are more experienced, and laboratory and surveillance systems more developed. There is also an Ebola vaccine, with the creation of a Gavi-funded emergency stockpile that will make 500 000 doses available to all countries to help them respond to outbreaks.

Also, although only a small proportion of Guinea's population was infected in 2014-16, these survivors may be immune to the Zaire strain of the virus, which was responsible for the last outbreak and which the vaccine is so far only approved for use against. Early reports suggest the same strain is implicated in the current outbreak, although this has yet to be confirmed. But how long does this immunity last?

Antibody tracking
-----------------
A recent study in Nature provides some clues [see reference below]. Although numerous studies have reported on the antibody concentrations of patients while they were ill with Ebola and immediately afterwards, this is among the first to systematically track the long-term antibody responses of survivors.

The researchers tracked levels of IgG -- the most common type of antibody found in blood and body fluids -- in 115 Ebola survivors from Sierra Leone for up to 500 days after they first became infected. Survivors experienced a rapid decline in these antibodies following their recovery, but some of them experienced a resurgence some 200-300 days later, before their antibody levels plummeted once again.

This was somewhat surprising because, although people usually retain long-lived "memory" cells after recovering from a virus, none of the Ebola patients experiencing this antibody resurgence had detectable levels of Ebola virus in their bodies.

Hidden reservoirs
-----------------
One possibility is that these memory cells were being stimulated by small amounts of virus replicating in immune-privileged tissues, such as the eyeball or prostate gland, which are shielded from a full-blown immune response. Alternatively, these memory cells might be stimulated by viral antigens persisting on immune cells called follicular dendritic cells, which loiter in the secondary lymphoid tissues and help to guide antibody responses in organs such as the spleen, lymph nodes, and mucosal surfaces; or by molecules present on survivor's own tissues, which have similar morphology to the virus molecules and which memory cells are mistaking for pieces of virus.

Booster shots
-------------
Mysterious as these waxing and waning antibodies are, if they're being produced in response to low-level viral replication, this would be good news, as it would imply that the immune systems of survivors remember the virus -- and that they may indeed be protected against subsequent infections.

It will be interesting to find out if vaccine-acquired immunity to Ebola virus is equally durable. The World Health Organization's (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization is currently reviewing the emerging clinical data on this, based on people who have been vaccinated since 2015.

However, the observation that antibody levels in survivors after this resurgence could also imply that their antibody immunity could be relatively short-lived, or that it too waxes and wanes over time. If confirmed, this could suggest a need to boost survivors' immunity through vaccination.

"Abstract
--------
Neutralizing antibody function provides a foundation for the efficacy of vaccines and Therapies. Here, using a robust in vitro Ebola virus (EBOV) pseudo-particle infection assay and a well-defined set of solid-phase assays, we describe a wide spectrum of antibody responses in a cohort of healthy survivors of the Sierra Leone EBOV outbreak of 2013-2016. Pseudo-particle virus-neutralizing antibodies correlated with total anti-EBOV reactivity and neutralizing antibodies against live EBOV. Variant EBOV glycoproteins (1995 and 2014 strains) were similarly neutralized. During longitudinal follow-up, antibody responses fluctuated in a 'decay-stimulation-decay' pattern that suggests de novo restimulation by EBOV antigens after recovery. A pharmacodynamic model of antibody reactivity identified a decay half-life of 77-100 days and a doubling time of 46-86 days in a high proportion of survivors. The highest antibody reactivity was observed around 200 days after an individual had recovered. The model suggests that EBOV antibody reactivity declines over 0.5-2 years after recovery. In a high proportion of healthy survivors, antibody responses undergo rapid restimulation. Vigilant follow-up of survivors and possible elective de novo antigenic stimulation by vaccine immunization should be considered in order to prevent EBOV viral recrudescence in recovering individuals and thereby to mitigate the potential risk of reseeding an outbreak."

Africa press review: the return of the Ebola virus to Guinea, a challenge in the time of COVID
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guinea is facing a reappearance of Ebola in the south of its territory, in Forest-Guinea. The epidemic risk is real, the region had been the cradle of a previous epidemic, from 2013 to 2016. The Radio Environnement Guinea site announced Wednesday [17 Feb 2021], 6 deaths and 216 contact cases. The very 1st victims are a nurse and members of her family who attended her funeral in late January [2021]. 2 neighboring states of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, have also been placed on high alert by the WHO as well as countries affected by the other Ebola outbreak the Democratic Republic of the Congo is currently experiencing.

Sequencing of viruses taken from patients in these 2 regions is in progress at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar. For the Guinean health authorities, confident in the handling of this epidemic, the unknown comes from the lack of confidence of the population. The local media are encouraged by the director of the Guinean National Health Agency (ANSS) to be more pedagogical.

The weapons at the disposal of the latter are substantial: in addition to the experience acquired during the previous epidemic, Guineans have rapid detection tests, new treatments, but also and above all, a vaccine. The country with expired stocks since last December [2020], awaits an imminent arrival.

The daily Le Monde mentions 2 tracks to explain the reasons for this resurgence: on the one hand, the "environmental" track. This region, as large as Slovakia, is experiencing intensive clearing. It is one of the " deforestation fronts " denounced in the latest WWF report published last January [2021]. The 2nd track would be the persistence of the virus in patients. Inserm researchers including Dr Aurelie Wiedemann interviewed by Le Monde followed nearly 800 Guineans for 2 years after their infection with the Ebola virus. The conclusions of their study published in July 2020 and analyzed on our site showed the persistence of "a particular immune profile", different from that of people who have never contracted the disease. And Le Monde asks:" Could it be then that the virus becomes active again after having been put to sleep?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Abstract
--------
Long-term follow up studies from Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivors (EBOV_S) are lacking. Here, we evaluate immune and gene expression profiles in 35 Guinean EBOV_S from the last West African outbreak, a median of 23 months (IQR [18-25]) after discharge from treatment center. Compared with healthy donors, EBOV_S exhibit increases in blood markers of inflammation, intestinal tissue damage, T cell and B cell activation, and a depletion of circulating dendritic cells. All survivors have EBOV-specific IgG antibodies and robust and polyfunctional EBOV-specific memory T-cell responses. Deep sequencing of the genes expressed in blood reveals an enrichment in 'inflammation' and 'antiviral' pathways. Integrated analyses identify specific immune markers associated with the persistence of clinical symptoms. This study identifies a set of biological and genetic markers that could be used to define a signature of "chronic Ebola virus disease (CEVD)."

"Discussion [abridged]
----------------------
Identifying the immune responses associated with protection against Ebola infection or survival is crucial. The development of strong T cell responses during acute infection has been shown to be important for viral clearance and survival, whereas B cell responses seem to be less efficient with very few potent B cell clones. However, data remain scarce for humans. We show here that survivors display strong, robust polyfunctional memory T cell responses to various Ebola epitopes. The antiviral functional capacity of these cells was not studied, but the phenotype of CD8+ T cells after in vitro stimulation (strong cytotoxicity marker expression) suggested that they remained cytotoxic. We were unable to study the progression of these responses longitudinally, but the high frequency of these cells 2 years after viral clearance is intriguing. Survivors also maintained strong specific IgG responses against various Ebola proteins, confirming previous studies from precedent outbreaks. These data and the recent demonstration of a change in IgG isotype during maturation of the anti-Ebola IgG repertoire in 4 survivors suggest that specific anti-Ebola responses change over time, consistent with possible persistent exposure to viral proteins captured at immunological sites or localized smoldering viral replication at sites of immune privilege (testes, eyes, and central nervous system). The ability of these responses to protect against secondary infection or control residual replication, thereby containing viral reservoirs, is unknown, but would have major implications for vaccine development."

- Environmental track: deforestation fronts

An area roughly the size of California lost to global deforestation from 2004-2017 [abridged]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"We are losing forests at an alarming rate.
Two-thirds of global forest cover loss is occurring in the tropic and subtropic regions of the world, where vast clusters of deforestation hot spots -- also known as "deforestation fronts" -- are destroying the important ecosystem services forests provide. There are 24 of these hot spots that are spread across Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Oceania, as illustrated by the map below [see URL above].

Over 160 000 square miles [about 415 000 sq km], an area roughly the size of California, were lost in these deforestation fronts between 2004 and 2017, according to a new report from World Wildlife Fund titled "Deforestation Fronts: Drivers and Responses in a Changing World [https://wwf.panda.org/discover/our_focus/forests_practice/deforestation_fronts_/]"

- Mon 22 Feb 2021. Denial of Ebola

Reluctance in Goueke (Nzerekore): citizens deny the existence of Ebola in the locality
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is great reluctance in Goueke, a sub-prefecture of Nzerekore (in southern Guinea) where the Ebola epidemic has recently reappeared. The inhabitants of the locality deny the existence of the disease at home, and refuse to comply with the measures taken by the authorities. A situation that risks seriously complicating the response to this epidemic, noted a special envoy from Guineematin.com on site.

We recently heard that there is Ebola in Goueke . But I do not agree with these false words, in which I do not believe at all, "said [JNH], a resident of Goueke. This citizen refuses to change his habits in the name of the fight against the Ebola virus. For him, the Guinean government is quite simply using this disease to get help from technical and financial partners.

"If Ebola were here, we would have known it already, because we know the human damage that this disease leaves in its path. But here, since the death of the lady (the nurse) almost 4 weeks ago, we have not learned of another death or even a case of illness in her family. If there have been cases of death, it is not in Goueke center here, it is perhaps outside our sub-prefecture. So if the government wants to lie in order to get something, they just have to do it, but there is no Ebola here," says [JNH].

And, this position is widely shared in the sub-prefecture of Goueke . Not believing at all in the presence of Ebola at home, the inhabitants of the locality do not respect any barrier measures. Even the closure of the weekly market in this urban municipality, announced by the authorities, was not respected. Met last Saturday [20 Feb 2021] in this market, [AL], a student at Goueke college, says he does not understand why the Guinean authorities want to close this market when it is not the only place where Ebola could spread.

"I came to the market to buy myself a bag, but I found the price to be very high because the market is not full. And, this is due to the government's decision to close our weekly market. But, why decide to close the market and leave the schools open? Or is it only in the market that Ebola can spread? In the classrooms, we are seated at 3 per table-bench, but there was no contamination there. We just want to tire our parents who are there suffering to feed us. So we ask the president to leave us in peace, because there is no Ebola here in Goueke", said this student.

The vaccination campaign compromised?
-------------------------------------
To avoid the 2013-2015 scenario (a period during which the Ebola virus killed more than 2500 people in Guinea), the authorities are betting this time on vaccination. The 1st doses of vaccines ordered by Guinea must arrive this Monday [22 Feb 2021] in Conakry so that the vaccination can begin tomorrow, [23 Feb 2021]. But, this operation may be complicated by the reluctance of the population. In Goueke, some citizens suggest that vaccines against Ebola are not welcome in the locality.

"They said there is disease with us here, but it is wrong. There is no illness here. They must not send us vaccines, because there is no Ebola here. If there was disease here, we would get vaccinated. But, why are we going to vaccinate people who are not sick? You see that our market is full, everyone is going about their business. We haven't seen an Ebola patient in Goueke, so we don't need their vaccines," said [OS], a resident of Goueke.

[3] Emergency appeal for support

https://www.voanews.com/africa/international-red-cross-issues-emergency-appeal-prevent-new-ebola-outbreak-west-africa


The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies [IFRC] is appealing for USD 9.4 million to fund efforts to prevent a new Ebola outbreak from spreading across West Africa.

The IFRC said Monday [22 Feb 2021] the money will be used to step up "surveillance and community sensitization efforts" in Guinea, Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Senegal, and Sierra Leone.

"Ebola does not care about borders," said Mohammed Mukhier, the IFRC's Regional Director for Africa. "Close social, cultural and economic ties between communities in Guinea and neighboring countries create a very serious risk of the virus spreading to Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire, and Sierra Leone, and potentially even further."

WHO has around 20 experts supporting national and provincial health authorities in the DRC.

The United Nations announced it is releasing USD15 million from its emergency relief fund to help fight the outbreaks in both Guinea and the DRC.
