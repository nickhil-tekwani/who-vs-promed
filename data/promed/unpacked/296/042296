For the 1st time, 2 cases of dengue fever have been found in
Kathmandu. Dengue is caused by dengue virus (DENV), a mosquito-borne
flavivirus. It is transmitted by _Aedes_ mosquitoes. "This is the 1st
discovery of dengue fever in the Kathmandu Valley even though the
disease was detected in the Tarai and inner-Tarai districts some 5
years ago," according Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, Teku.

"_Aedes_ mosquitoes are found in cold water, freeze [?], cooler
houses and other cold places, and rich people are vulnerable to
dengue fever," said Dr Bashu Dev Pandey at Teku Hospital on Monday
[17 May 2010]. [_Aedes_ mosquitoes that transmit dengue virus are
mainly tropical and subtropical, and not confined to cool or cold
places. - Mod.TY]

He said the disease is communicable from one person to another [via
_Aedes_ mosquitoes - Mod.TY], and its symptoms are high fever,
bleeding and unconsciousness. "If an infected person is not treated
on time, the patient may die," he said.

_Aedes_ mosquitoes also breed in water collections in artificial
containers such as plastic cups, used tires, broken bottles, flower
pots, etc. Dr Pandey advised people to keep their freezes [?] and
cooler houses clean and treat water to remain safe from the disease.

Dengue fever is an acute febrile disease which normally occurs in the
tropics. It is also known as break-bone fever and can be
life-threatening. There is no tested and approved vaccine for the
dengue flavivirus. Prevention of dengue mainly is in mosquito
control. Dengue may also be transmitted via infected blood products
including blood transfusions, plasma, and platelets.

<http://www.speroforum.com/a/32862/Sri-Lanka---Dengue-kills-76-infects-13500-people-since-January>


Epidemiologists with the Dengue Eradication Programme warned that the
disease could spread because of the coming rainy season. Between
January and April [2010], dengue [virus] already infected 13 500
people causing the deaths of 76. The scientists accuse the government
of failing to take appropriate steps to stop the spreading of the
tropical disease, like stockpiling insecticides or adequately
informing the public.

Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease [virus] caused by 4 distinct, but
closely related, viruses (DEN 1, DEN 2, DEN 3 and DEN 4). Its
symptoms include high fever and can in some cases cause fatal
haemorrhaging. It is found in tropical and subtropical regions,
acting up during and after the rainy season. Southeast Asia is one of
the most affected areas with more than 100 000 cases per year.

There is no vaccine to protect against the tropical disease. The best
way to avoid it is to stay away from mosquitoes, which can be killed
by a group of bacteria called _Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis_
(BTI) used as biological control agents for larvae stages or by
eliminating stagnant waters from inhabited areas. Prevention is thus
the key to success.

Recently, the head of the Epidemic Diseases Unit, Dr Paba
Palihawadana, in cooperation with Cuban specialists in epidemic
diseases looked at the efficacy of BTI in the island nation. His
report was favourable, and he got permission and funds to import 30
litres of the bacterial product for spraying. However, BTI supplies
have not been used, despite the rapid spreading of the disease.
Health Minister Maithripala Sirisena said that BTI would be imported
even if it could not alone eradicate dengue, this despite claims by
Cuban scientists that it was the only effective method against
dengue-bearing mosquitoes.

In the meantime, epidemiologists with the Dengue Eradication
Programme have urged the public to keep their homes and gardens clean
and cooperate with the authorities as the rainy season approaches,
increasing the likelihood of a tropical fever outbreak.

The Jaffna Peninsula in northern Sri Lanka is the area most at risk
because of stagnant waters and the presence of large refugee camps
with poor sanitation.

[3] Tanzania (Dar es Salaam)
Date: Sat 15 May 2010
From: Belia Klaassen <bklaassen@istclinic.com> [edited]


This is to report about at least 17 suspect dengue fever cases seen
at our clinic in Dar es Salaam Tanzania since April 2010. In 2 Jan
[2010], cases of proven dengue in Japanese travelers were already reported.

Since the 1st half of April 2010, we have seen at least 17 patients
suspected with dengue fever symptoms and typical lab results with low
WBC, low platelet counts and sometimes raised liver enzymes. All
patients were tested negative for malaria and were followed up for
1-2 weeks. Since 10 May 2010, a rapid dengue test was obtained, and
out of the 17 cases, 8 were tested positive on the rapid test (some
IgG and IgM both positive). All patients were (expatriate) residents
in Dar es Salaam, and some had been in Zanzibar the week(s) before
the infection: 8 male, 9 female, 2 children (2 and 7 years old).
Dengue serology was sent for virological serotyping of the virus, but
no results are known yet. No cases of DHF were seen so far.

The cases have been reported to the Tanzanian Ministry of Health.

Up till now, dengue was not recorded (except for possible chikungunya
up-country) in Dar es Salaam or elsewhere in Tanzania.

The L'RAS [Association Sante Reunion) has published its weekly
report: dengue - one case.

Communicated by:
ProMED-mail
<promed@promedmail.org>

[This case occurred in a mixed dengue and chikungunya virus outbreak.
Both viruses are transmitted by the same _Aedes_ mosquito vector.
This report does not specify if the case was imported or locally
acquired. Although just one case, given the ongoing chikungunya virus
transmission, additional dengue virus transmission would not be surprising.

The last report from the Epidemiological Institute of Health is
rather alarming. Since the beginning of April [2010], the number of
people affected by dengue continues to grow. For that, experts refer
to the number of people received in consultation and who have
symptoms of dengue, namely a high fever, headache, muscle aches and
joint pain, rash, or vomiting. This number is 500 per week, a rate 7
times the maximum level observed during this same period [in 2009].

After analysis, the epidemic phase is confirmed and the case numbers
are stable. They vary between 40 and 60 per week. A peak at 80 was
observed in mid-March 2010 but dropped in the following weeks. The
number of people hospitalized from the disease is also stable. Of the
94 hospitalizations since the epidemic began, 16 were severe, and 24
have developed the DHF form of the disease.

Grande-Terre is the area most affected, especially the town of St.
Francis. The town itself is responsible for 10 percent of all cases
each month. Basse-Terre, Petit-Bourg and Sainte-Rose have the largest
number of cases since the beginning of the epidemic.

A combination of factors is behind the increase in cases. Heat, rain,
resistance of the mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_, to insecticides, and
many stagnant water places for mosquito breeding; these factors all
contribute to the disease [virus] spread.

The emphasis is on prevention. The goal is not to be breeding _Aedes
aegypti_, the mosquito vector of dengue [virus]. A communication plan
has been adapted and is in place. Insecticide spraying is ongoing as
are the checking operations on sites deemed to be sensitive.

The French Departments of the Americas are not equal on the dengue
front. Guadeloupe and Guyana are in phase 4 of program monitoring,
warning and management of epidemics, corresponding to a confirmed
outbreak. Martinique is one notch below. There, the epidemic is at
the risk stage.

Today [16 May 2010], health authorities increase their work to combat
dengue in Escuintla department [state or province equivalent] in the
south of Guatemala. Above all, they are trying to avoid storage of
potable water, without the necessary precautions, that favor the
[breeding] of the agent that transmits the disease [virus], the
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.

Priority work is in the 4 municipalities where water is most scarce
and [where] coincidentally 261 of the 313 [dengue] registered
infected individuals are concentrated. A "yellow alert" was declared
in this department since, in the course of this year [2010], the
number of [dengue] cases is greater than in all of 2009, when there
were 307 [cases], 208 with classical dengue and 99 of DHF. For this
last variety [type of disease - DHF], 90 infected individuals have
been counted, of which a girl died this past March [2010].

[There is] a campaign together with information developed by various
municipal government institutions in which the specialists try to
identify the so-called "red zones" where the greatest proliferation
of the vector mosquito exists.

However, this work faces difficulties due to the negative [reaction]
of some residents stopping investigation of the interior of their
dwellings [to check on] the possibility of vector breeding sites.

The rainy season still has not reached its apogee, and in the country
there have been increased numbers of affected individuals registered
due to diseases related to this season. Just in the capital
[Managua], 2784 dengue cases have been recorded. Most of the affected
individuals are children 3-5 years of age.

In the most recent weeks, there has been an upsurge of dengue in
Guatemala, El Salvador and Costa Rica.

There have been several deaths from the disease. Nicaragua still has
sequelae from last year's [2009] outbreak. Officials from the
Ministry of Health (MINSA) state that, currently, there is [dengue]
virus circulation, and while this situation goes on, the populace
does not comply with hygiene and sanitary measures at home, so we
will continue to be affected by dengue.

"We, as the responsible ministry, have not lowered our guard since
the beginning of the dengue outbreak. However, currently in Managua,
we have 2784 suspected dengue cases, of which 378 are positive. These
are distributed all over the capital, in both rural and urban areas,"
said the person responsible for the vector transmission program of
MINSA, Maria Dolores Flores. Since this past April [2010], the Local
Integrated Health System, Silas-Managua, initiated an abate [_Aedes_
larvicide] effort and recently began fumigation; however, despite
that both activities are free, the people do not permit the personnel
of the [health] brigades to enter their houses. Because of this, "we
must remind the populace that all MINSA personnel carry
identification, and their vehicles are labeled. Moreover, we travel
in groups of 20 or more people," Flores insisted.

However, the main problem which the health workers have found is the
excess of trash which is in the streets, ditches and in the houses.
All of this discarded [trash] accumulation, with the rains, makes for
mosquito breeding sites. She also stated that, "the people must be
clear that dengue kills, without respect to color, race, social
status or political creed. Although, for now, nobody has died due to
this disease, we have had very serious cases in intensive care units.
Last year [2009], there were 9126 cases in this outbreak," she also said.

[9] Ecuador (Galapagos): Request for Information (RFI)
Date: Wed 12 May 2010
From: Name withheld on request [edited]


I have been on the island of San Cristobal, Galapagos for the past 2
weeks. I am a public health doctor, and, interestingly, given the
situation I am about to describe, my friend here with me works in
tropical medicine.

Since we have arrived, there have been widespread reports of dengue,
both on this island and the other main island, Santa Cruz. Here in
Cristobal, it is widely discussed and accepted that much of the
population has already experienced, or is coming down now, with
dengue like symptoms, i.e. fever, headache, myalgias, lethargy and
some reports of arthralgia and rash (non petechial) associated with
the resolution of the fever. Indeed, among my extended family here,
there are currently only 2 or 3 who have not experienced symptoms out
of over 30. Word of mouth has it that there have been at least 500
hospital presentations and many more who are staying at home.

My own symptoms began 2 days ago, with myalgias and fatigue and a
fever at night. My 3-year-old daughter has also had a fever since
yesterday, and most of the family have experienced symptoms in the
preceding month or so, although many are still coming down with
symptoms now. A sister-in-law and her husband were bed-bound, and we
had to put drips up in their house because the single hospital on the
island is full, all with dengue, we are told.

Since arriving there, have been many Ministry of Public Health
officials here fogging with malathion (we are told) and putting some
kind of granular insecticide [probably abate, a larvicide - Mod.TY]
in the stored water tanks that are very common in the houses here.
There have been reports on the local television news as well as local
radio about the dengue outbreak.

Before leaving to come to Galapagos, we were aware of reports from
mid March [2010] of isolated dengue cases in San Cristobal; however,
there does not appear to be a single further mention of the situation
anywhere that we can find on ProMED or any of the other sites we have
looked at, such as CDC and WHO, or even on the Ministry of Public
Health of Ecuador site, as far as we can tell.

I cannot understand why there have been no further reports on ProMED
since mid-March 2010. Is this because cases are not confirmed
serologically? Is it because there are no formal reports? Is there
some other reason that is known? I would have thought that given
there is some kind of outbreak going on here, with a very high attack
rate from all concerned, that something should have filtered onto ProMED.

Do you have any information at all, such as the strain, the epidemic
curve, islands affected, total number of cases including any dengue
haemorrhagic fever?

[The physician who submitted this report raises critical questions
about the lack of information on what appears to be a significant
dengue outbreak on 2 of the Galapagos Islands. ProMED requests
information about this situation. It is very difficult to avoid
reporting of dengue outbreaks in important tourist destinations, and
failure to do so has the potential for damaging the credibility of
the responsible public health agencies.

A 60-year-old man and a 5-year-old boy died from dengue, raising the
death toll from the disease in Paraguay to 11, with most of the
deaths reported in areas near the border with Brazil, health
officials said Thursday [6 May 2010]. "Two new deaths have been added
this week: a male patient, aged 60 from Pedro Juan (Caballero) and a
boy aged 5 from Fernando de la Mora," Health Ministry disease
monitoring service specialist Dr. Agueda Aguero said.

Pedro Juan Caballero, located 540 km (335 miles) northeast of
Asuncion and on the border with Brazil's Matto Grosso do Sul state,
is the capital of Amambay province, while Fernando de la Mora is a
town near Asuncion.

Of the 12 000 notifications sent to health officials, 4971 dengue
cases have been confirmed, the majority of them in Central, Amambay,
Concepcion and Alto Parana provinces, Aguero said. Concepcion and
Alto Parana are on the border with Brazil. "Practically in all the
provinces, (the virus) is going around," the health official said.
The disease spread across Paraguay due to the movement of large
numbers of people during Holy Week, [Easter Week] Aguero said.

Paraguay did not have any fatal dengue cases in 2008 and 2009, but an
epidemic in early 2007 killed 17 people and infected 27 000 others.
