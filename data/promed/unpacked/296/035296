INFLUENZA, PANDEMIC: DISEASE ARCHEOLOGY (6)
===========================================
Date: Sat, 22 Jun 1996 14:00:43 -0400
From: HalHous@aol.com

Ed Lennette's reference to the records or archives of the Influenza
Commission, AFEB, as a source of information about the examination of bodies
of persons who died during the 1918-19 influenza pandemic prompted me to
reread the history of the Influenza Commission written by Gordon
Meiklejohn (The Armed Forces Epidemiological Board, The Histories of the
Commissions, Ed. Theodore E. Woodward, Office of The Surgeon General, Textbook
of Military Medicine, Borden Institute, Walter Reed Army Medical Center,
Washington, DC 20307-5001, 1994).
There is no mention of or allusion to the events described by Ed Lennette.
This doesn't mean they didn't happen or that Gordon neglected to include
them. It is more likely that the record has been lost, destroyed or is otherwise
undiscoverable. Having searched for archival information relative to the
Streptococcal Diseases Commission I can attest to the difficulty of locating
records in the AFEB office and elsewhere. This is said partly to preempt
requests to Ted Woodward to "look at the archives".
