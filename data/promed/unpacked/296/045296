Nearly a dozen people, including several marines, at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall fell ill [on Tue 27 Feb 2018] after they opened a suspicious letter containing an unknown substance. The letter was received about 3:30 p.m. in Henderson Hall, which Arlington Fire officials described as an administrative building. A gunnery sergeant opened a letter and showed it to a superior, a Pentagon official told NBC News.

Up to 11 people began to feel ill, and the building was evacuated. Three of those people were taken to a hospital in stable condition, officials said in a press release. The marines affected reported itchy hands and face and bloody noses, a marine official said. It is unclear how many people suffered from those symptoms.

A large number of police and medics responded to the Northern Virginia military base, which is near the Pentagon and Arlington National Cemetery. The FBI, Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) and local hazardous material teams cleared the building with base police.

The NCIS and FBI are conducting a joint investigation, according to a press release. Information was not available immediately on what the unknown substance could be.

Federal and military officials are investigating a hazmat incident that sickened 11 marines at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall in Arlington, Virginia, on [Tue 27 Feb 2018]. The FBI and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service were called in when the Marine Corps personnel began feeling ill after an envelope containing an unknown substance was opened at the joint base, which is next to Arlington National Cemetery and near the Pentagon.

Personnel inside the building were immediately evacuated, officials said, and local fire department hazmat teams responded to the scene within minutes.

A total of 3 marines were transported to a nearby hospital for treatment with non-life threatening conditions. They were treated and released from the hospital late [Tue 27 Feb 2018] night, according to a press release from Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall. The 8 others, who had symptoms ranging from itching to nasal irritation, were being assessed, a marine official told ABC News.

Field tests on the suspicious material found inside the envelope came back negative for any known substance, a law enforcement official told ABC News. The envelope and the substance were taken to the FBI's lab at Quantico for further testing. The incident remains under investigation. The FBI and the NCIS are conducting a joint investigation, according to the press release from Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall.

Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall is the name for the army and marine base commonly-known as Fort Myer, home to the Old Guard honor guard unit and Henderson Hall, where marines are stationed.

[Other reports have indicated there were bloody noses, and burning sensations of the skin. Still others report itchy skin to intensely itchy.

An old product called itching powder comes to mind, but it does not produce bloody noses or a rapid onset of feeling ill. It seems the effects of the contents of the envelope were pretty immediate, so one wonders if crystals or powder were giving off a gas. Other illicit substances come to mind, but the entire spectrum of clinical signs does not add up. We look forward to the results of the investigation and wish those affected a speedy recovery.
