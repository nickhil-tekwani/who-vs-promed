[2] Wolbachia blockage of dengue
Date: Thu 1 Mar 2018

Thomas S, Verma J, Woolfit M and O'Neill SL. Wolbachia-mediated virus blocking in mosquito cells is dependent on XRN1-mediated viral RNA degradation and influenced by viral replication rate. PLoS Pathog. 2018;14(3):e1006879. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006879

Abstract
_Wolbachia_ is currently being developed as a novel tool to block the transmission of dengue viruses (DENV) by _Aedes aegypti_. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the DENV-blocking phenotype in mosquitoes, including competition for fatty acids like cholesterol, manipulation of host miRNAs and upregulation of innate immune pathways in the mosquito. We examined the various stages in the DENV infection process to better understand the mechanism of _Wolbachia_-mediated virus blocking (WMVB). Our results suggest that infection with _Wolbachia_ does not inhibit DENV binding or cell entry, but reduces virus replication. In contrast to a previous report, we also observed a similar reduction in replication of West Nile virus (WNV). This reduced replication is associated with rapid viral RNA degradation in the cytoplasm. We didn't find a role for host miRNAs in WMVB. Further analysis showed that the 3' end of the virus subgenomic RNA was protected and accumulated over time suggesting that the degradation is XRN1-mediated. We also found that sub genomic flavivirus RNA accumulation inactivated XRN1 in mosquito cells in the absence of _Wolbachia_ and led to enhancement of RNA degradation in its presence. Depletion of XRN1 decreased WMVB which was associated with a significant increase in DENV RNA. We also observed that WMVB is influenced by virus MOI and rate of virus replication. A comparatively elevated blocking was observed for slowly replicating DENV, compared to WNV. Similar results were obtained while analysing different DENV serotypes.

Author summary
Dengue virus (DENV) is a human pathogen transmitted by _Aedes_ mosquitoes. Infection with DENV causes dengue fever and may develop into life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever. Dengue disease is increasing globally and current control methods are proving ineffective in curtailing this growing problem. A novel strategy to stop DENV transmission is currently being trialled in 5 countries through the introduction of _Wolbachia_, an insect endosymbiont, into wild _Aedes aegypti_ populations. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain _Wolbachia_-mediated virus blocking (WMVB) including the response of the host to _Wolbachia_ and factors like cholesterol, immune genes and miRNAs. Here we followed the fate of virus in mosquito cell lines and found that _Wolbachia_ does not alter virus binding or internalisation. Further tracking of the virus shows that its replication is reduced in the presence of _Wolbachia_. The reduced replication is associated with increased viral RNA degradation for both DENV and West Nile virus (WNV). Unlike earlier reports, we didn't find any evidence for miRNA involvement in WMVB. Analysing the viral RNA further shows that the 3' region of viral RNA is not fully degraded, indicating that the degradation is likely due to the cellular enzyme XRN1. Accumulation of DENV 3' regions inhibited XRN1 in the absence of _Wolbachia_ and reduced the activity of XRN1 but not in the presence _Wolbachia_. Knockdown of XRN1 using siRNA resulted in decreased WMVB associated with increased DENV RNA. The magnitude of WMVB is also dependent on the infectious virus dose and the intrinsic rate at which the virus strain replicates. Similar results were seen for different DENV serotypes confirming that slowly replicating viruses are blocked more efficiently by _Wolbachia_.

[3] Stroke risk increase

Abstract
Background: Stroke is a severe neurologic complication of dengue fever, described in only a few case reports. The incidence and risk factors for stroke in patients with dengue remain unclear. We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study to investigate the risk of stroke in patients with dengue.

Methods: Using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we included a total of 13 787 patients with dengue newly diagnosed between 2000 and 2012. The control cohort consisted of patients who did not have dengue, matched 1:1 by demographic characteristics and stroke-related comorbidities. We calculated the cumulative incidences and hazard ratios (HRs) of stroke in both cohorts using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression.

Results: The overall incidence rate of stroke was 5.33 per 1000 person-years in the dengue cohort and 3.72 per 1000 person-years in the control cohort, with an adjusted HR of 1.16 (95 percent confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.32). The risk of stroke among patients with dengue was highest in the first 2 months after diagnosis (25.53 per 1000 person-years, adjusted HR 2.49, 95 percent CI 1.48-4.18).

Interpretation: Dengue fever was associated with an increased risk of stroke in the first few months after diagnosis. The effect of dengue on stroke may be acute rather than chronic.

[4] Ethnic susceptibility to DF and DSS

Abstract
Ethnic diversity has been long considered as one of the factors explaining why the severe forms of dengue are more prevalent in Southeast Asia than anywhere else. Here we take advantage of the admixed profile of Southeast Asians to perform coupled association-admixture analyses in Thai cohorts. For dengue shock syndrome (DSS), the significant haplotypes are located in genes coding for phospholipase C members (PLCB4 added to previously reported PLCE1), related to inflammation of blood vessels. For dengue fever (DF), we found evidence of significant association with CHST10, AHRR, PPP2R5E and GRIP1 genes, which participate in the xenobiotic metabolism signaling pathway. We conducted functional analyses for PPP2R5E, revealing by immunofluorescence imaging that the coded protein co-localizes with both DENV1 and DENV2 NS5 proteins. Interestingly, only DENV2-NS5 migrated to the nucleus, and a deletion of the predicted top-linking motif in NS5 abolished the nuclear transfer. These observations support the existence of differences between serotypes in their cellular dynamics, which may contribute to differential infection outcome risk. The contribution of the identified genes to the genetic risk render Southeast and Northeast Asian populations more susceptible to both phenotypes, while African populations are best protected against DSS and intermediately protected against DF, and Europeans the best protected against DF but the most susceptible against DSS.

Author summary
Dengue fever is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas of East Asia and America, but globalization and climate changes are introducing vector and virus to the naïve regions of Europe and North America. In this work we conducted a statistically robust, coupled association-admixture test in 2 dengue cohorts from Thailand (classical dengue fever, DF, and dengue shock syndrome, DSS) and a published Vietnamese (DSS only) cohort. We identified new candidate genes associated with DF risk and confirmed known gene family association with DSS risk. In DF, phosphatase control is crucial, including through binding to viral proteins, as we showed for PPP2R5E protein co-localization with DENV1 and DENV2-NS5 proteins within liver cells and differential cellular localizations along time. In DSS, cytokine dynamics, inflammation and activation of vascular endothelium cells are dominant features. The particular genetic risk conferred by these genes indicates that Southeast and Northeast Asians are highly susceptible to both phenotypes, while Africans are best protected against DSS, and Europeans best protected against DF but the most susceptible against DSS.

[This study provides a genetic basis for observed higher incidence of DSS in East and Southeast Asians compared to Africans and Europeans. It would be of interest to know the genetic status of Central and South Americans, many of whom are of admixtures European, indigenous and often African ancestry and how that may relate to DF and DSS susceptibility. - Mod.TY]
