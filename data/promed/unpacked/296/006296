Wildlife officials in Michigan are warning hunters to inspect their deer for a serious disease.

The state's Department of Natural Resources says bovine tuberculosis was reported in 10 counties last year [2017], and managers are trying to eradicate the disease from white-tail deer in the state.

So far in the 2018 hunting season, Michigan DNR has reported 5 cases in 4 counties.

The DNR shared a photo of an infected deer's rib cage, showing white, bubble-shaped sores on the flesh.

Tuberculosis is caused by bacteria attacking the respiratory system of animals and humans. Bovine tuberculosis can infect the widest variety of animals.

The bacteria are spread by coughing, sneezing and exchanging saliva. Food having been contaminated by the saliva of an infected animal can spread it as well.

Michigan is reportedly the only state in the nation having bovine tuberculosis in wild deer.

Hunters in 16 counties are being urged to submit heads of harvested deer for testing. Those counties include:

Alcona
Alpena
Cheboygan
Crawford
Huron
Iosco
Lake
Mecosta
Montmorency
Newaygo
Ogemaw
Osceola
Oscoda
Otsego
Presque Isle
Roscommon

[A timely warning for deer hunters. The original website has a great picture of TB on the inside of the rib cage.

It is interesting to note Michigan being the only state having TB in deer. Nevertheless, it is a warning for all deer hunters, especially in neighboring states, to be alert for the signs in the deer they harvest.

It appears the list of counties in this alert has increased since the previous warning in October 2018.

Tuberculosis is circulating in the cattle herds in Michigan. Cattle and cervids (deer, elk) often have contact with cattle. As the hunting season is upon those in many areas, this should serve as a reminder to be on the lookout for unusual things, such as large lymph nodes or necrotic areas or other abnormalities in your animal when field dressing the animal. It should also serve as a reminder to take along some disposable gloves for use during this process. These gloves are a protective measure for you.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. Bovine TB, caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.

The cooperative federal-state-industry effort to eradicate bovine TB from cattle in the USA has made significant progress since the program's inception in 1917. The disease has nearly been eliminated from the livestock population of the USA. Many consider this one of the great animal and public health achievements in the USA. However, our ultimate goal of eradication remains elusive as animal health officials continue to detect TB sporadically in livestock herds.
