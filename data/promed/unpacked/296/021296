Several states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration are continuing to investigate a multistate outbreak of foodborne hepatitis A. Information available at this time does not indicate an ongoing risk of acquiring hepatitis A virus infection at Tropical Smoothie Cafés, as the contaminated food product has been removed as of 8 Aug 2016. Symptoms of hepatitis A virus infection can take up to 50 days [but average about 28 days - Mod.LL] to appear. As a result, CDC continues to identify cases of hepatitis A related to the initial contaminated product.

A total of 113 people with hepatitis A have been reported from 7 states: Maryland (10), New York (1), North Carolina (1), Oregon (1), Virginia (94), West Virginia (5), and Wisconsin (1). As many as 39 ill people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Epidemiologic and traceback evidence indicate frozen strawberries imported from Egypt are the likely source of this outbreak. In interviews, nearly all ill people interviewed reported drinking smoothies containing strawberries at Tropical Smoothie Café locations prior to 8 Aug 2016 in a limited geographical area, including Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia.

On 8 Aug 2016, Tropical Smoothie Café reported that they removed the Egyptian frozen strawberries from their restaurants in Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia and switched to another supplier.

[The outbreak ought to be slowing down once the incubation period (which averages 28 days but can be as long 45-50 days) is over, although secondary household cases may occur. As a reminder, hepatitis A vaccine is part of universal childhood immunization [in the United States. - Mod.SH] so it is likely that most of the cases were in adults. - Mod.LL
