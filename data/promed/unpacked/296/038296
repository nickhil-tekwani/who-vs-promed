A third person who contracted Legionnaire's disease has died at Harford
Memorial Hospital, bringing to five the total number of confirmed cases.
The person was a patient in the hospital from June 18th to June 28th,
before health officials discovered the bacteria, hospital spokesman Robert
Netherland said Sunday. The person returned to the hospital on Friday and
died that evening. Test results came back Saturday confirming the patient
had the bacteria that causes Legionnaire's disease.
"This person was very ill with other medical conditions," Netherland said.
"We believe that the legionella helped contribute to the death, but was not
the sole cause."
Two other patients who contracted the respiratory disease have died. One
remains at the hospital.
Officials believe a hot water tank at the hospital was the probable source
of the bacteria for at least three patients. The tank has been taken off line.
About a dozen water samples taken from the tank and outlets downstream from
it tested positive for the bacteria. The water supply for the hospital did
not test positive, although small amounts of the bacteria are believed to
have entered the hospital through the water supply and multiplied in the
warmth of the tank, state health officials said Friday.
The source of the bacteria in the case of the person who is still at the
hospital hasn't been tracked.
Health official said Friday that additional cases were possible because the
incubation period for the disease is 2-to-10 days and the system was
flushed July 2. Doctors at the hospital and the public have been told to be
alert for further cases.
