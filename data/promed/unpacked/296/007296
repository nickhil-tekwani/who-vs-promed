Genome Sequence of Enterovirus D68 from St. Louis, Missouri, USA
----------------------------------------------------------------
During the current (2014) enterovirus/rhinovirus season in the United States, enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is circulating at an unprecedented level. As of [6 Oct 2014], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had confirmed 594 cases of EV-D68 infection in 43 states and the District of Columbia (http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/outbreaks/EV-D68-outbreaks.html); the actual number of cases was undoubtedly much higher. In mid-August [2014], hospitals in Missouri and Illinois noticed an increased number of patients with severe respiratory illness. We observed this pattern at St. Louis Children's Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri.

Before the current season, only 7 whole-genome sequences and 5 additional complete coding sequences of the virus were available. Therefore, determining whether there are genomic elements associated with rapid spread or severe and unusual disease was not possible. To address these limitations, we determined the complete coding sequence of 1 strain from St. Louis by using high-throughput sequencing of nucleic acid from a clinical sample. To evaluate the sequence diversity in EV-D68 strains circulating in the St. Louis metropolitan area, we also generated partial-genome sequences from 8 more EV-D68-positive clinical samples from St. Louis. During the preparation of this article, CDC generated and submitted to GenBank 7 complete or nearly complete genome sequences from viruses obtained from the Midwest. We have documented the diversity of the sequences of strains from St. Louis and compared them to publicly available sequences.

Patients were categorized retrospectively as having mild, moderate, or severe disease if they had been discharged home from the emergency unit, admitted to general wards, or admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, respectively. Residual material from a subset of nasopharyngeal specimens positive for rhinovirus/enterovirus were selected for high-throughput sequencing. [Details of the technical methods and the graphic presentation of the data have been omitted and interested readers should access the original text via the source URL.]

EV-D68 sequences were detected in 7 of 10 samples from patients with severe disease, 2 of 2 with moderate disease, and 0 of 2 with mild disease. The complete coding sequence was assembled from sample EV-D68_STL_2014_12. Several of the genome sequences obtained from Missouri strains from this season, which had been sequenced by CDC, were very similar to this genome sequence. Comparison of the virus protein 1 sequence with that of publicly available sequences indicated that the strain from St. Louis and the strain from the Missouri cluster with virus strains identified in Europe and Asia within the past several years. The St. Louis virus shared 97-99 percent aa sequence identity with all other sequenced strains. We observed little variation in the strains from St. Louis because they shared 98-99 percent nt sequence identity.

We provide a genome sequence from the 2014 outbreak of EV-D68 infection in St. Louis, Missouri. This sequence seems to be highly representative of the strains circulating in St. Louis during this time because the other genomes we partially sequenced are very similar. To our knowledge, no amino acids have been associated with virulence or increased infectivity of EV-D68; therefore, we cannot associate the changes we observed in these genomes to phenotypic traits. Because changes in the 5' untranslated region have the potential to affect the rate of replication, it is possible that minor genome changes are responsible for the rapid spread and high severity of disease in 2014. Correlation between clinical features of patients in conjunction with additional genomic analysis might provide further insight into the pathogenetic determinants of this strain. Therefore the genome sequence of EV-D68 determined from the 2014 outbreak in St. Louis, Missouri, provides a resource for tracking and genomic comparison of this rapidly spreading virus.

[This analysis reveals considerable genetic diversity among isolates of human enterovirus D68, but has not identified any specific differences that might determine the increased prevalence of the EV-D68 virus during the current epidemic period. Furthermore, the researchers analysed the strain from St. Louis and the strain from the Missouri cluster with virus strains identified in Europe and Asia within the past several years.

As of 28 Oct 2014, the CDC or state public health laboratories have confirmed a total of 1105 cases in 47 states and the District of Columbia with respiratory illness caused by EV-D68. CDC expects that, as with other enteroviruses, EV-D68 infections will likely begin to decline by late fall. CDC has received informal reports from some hospitals and states that are seeing signs of decreasing EV-D68 infections. CDC is gathering more information from states and assessing whether this represents a national trend (http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/outbreaks/EV-D68-outbreaks.html). - Mod.CP
