The FDA is warning consumers not to eat Veggie Booty snack food, marketed
by Robert's American Gourmet, due to possible contamination with
_Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Wandsworth bacteria.
FDA advises consumers to throw away any Robert's American Gourmet brand
Veggie Booty they have in their home. Veggie Booty is sold in a flexible
plastic foil bag in 4 ounce, 1 ounce, and 1/2 ounce packages. Veggie Booty
is often consumed by children, so parents are encouraged to watch their
children, and seek medical care if they observe signs of illness.
This warning is based on 52 reports of illness across 17 states, beginning
in March 2007. Almost all the illnesses have occurred in children under 10
years old, with the most cases in toddlers. Most persons had reported
bloody diarrhea; 4 were hospitalized. FDA learned of the illnesses on 27
Jun 2007 from the CDC, which conducted an investigation of the illnesses
with state and local health officials. The outbreak is considered likely to
be ongoing.
States reporting illnesses include: California (7 cases), Colorado (5
cases), Connecticut (1 case), Georgia (1 case), Indiana (1 case),
Massachusetts (3 cases), Minnesota (2 cases), New Hampshire (2 cases), New
Jersey (2 cases), New York (13 cases), Oregon (1 case), Pennsylvania (3
cases), Tennessee (1), Texas (1), Vermont (3 cases), Washington (4 cases),
and Wisconsin (2 cases).
Robert's American Gourmet, of Sea Cliff, NY, which markets Veggie Booty,
and its contract manufacturer, are fully cooperating with FDA's
investigation into the cause of the contamination. Manufacturing and
distribution of this product has ceased, and Robert's American Gourmet is
recalling all potentially contaminated product, including all expiration
dates and lot codes. The product is sold in all 50 states and Canada at
retail locations and over the internet.
