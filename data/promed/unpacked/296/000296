Hong Kong confirms 25 new cases of cholera
Hong Kong on Monday confirmed 25 new cases of cholera, the highest
number announced in a single day since the health alert began last week.
The new cases were related to three tour groups returning from Thailand
and brings the total number of cases to 28, the government said in a
statement.
Local media have said the groups had visited Bangkok and Pattaya, but
Hong Kong and Thai officials could not confirm the reports. Hong Kong
authorities moved into high gear on Monday in an attempt to stem the
spread of cholera with inspections of flights from Thailand and checks
on imported seafood.
Quarantine inspectors boarded planes on Monday to check all passengers
from Thailand after authorities confirmed on Saturday that three locals
had contracted the disease after vacationing in Thailand earlier in
March. "We have medical staff go on all arriving planes from Thailand
where we check on their health conditions and give information on what
they should do if they feel unwell," a Health Department spokesman said.
But a senior Thai health official lashed out at Hong Kong for playing up
the cholera cases. "I don't know the motive for Hong Kong officials to
play up the story. Their remarks are not fair to us. I suspect there are
some other hidden reasons," Yudh Photharamic, director general of
Thailand's Communicable Diseases Department, said in Bangkok. "I can
assure you that there is no cholera in Thailand," Yudh said. He said he
suspected Hong Kong tourists had caught diarrhea, a common problem in 40
of 76 Thai provinces. He said remarks made by Hong Kong officials could
scare tourists away.
Before the rash of cases from Thailand, there had been 13 local cases of
cholera in Hong Kong this year and two from China, giving a total of 43
cases. No deaths from cholera have been reported. All local cases were
believed to have been caused by eating shellfish and the government
announced on Monday it would test all imported shellfish for cholera
before sale.
