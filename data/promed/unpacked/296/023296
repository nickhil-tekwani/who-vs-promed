First record of Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1984) in Israel
------------------------------------------------------------
During an ongoing survey of adult mosquitoes collected for the
purpose of monitoring West Nile virus, several adult specimens of
_Ae. albopictus_ were identified by the Entomology Laboratory,
Ministry of Health, Jerusalem. About 20 females were collected by the
Ministry of Environment in August and September, 2002 from 2
locations about 5km from Israel's main international airport at Lod.
Subsequent searches for the breeding sites of _Ae. albopictus_
revealed the presence of dozens of larvae in water remaining in
discarded tyres in a field adjacent to the village of Ginnaton.
In Europe, _Ae. albopictus_ has been introduced over the last 10
years into France, Italy and Albania, but this is the first record
of the species in the Eastern Mediterranean area. While _Ae.
albopictus_ is a known and important vector of dengue in Southeast
Asia and China, autochthonous dengue has not been recorded in Europe
and it is assumed that the disease is unlikely to be a problem in
Israel. Monitoring and controlling the mosquito populations is
imperative.
