Statistics from the Institute of Public Health [indicate] that 37 cases of [a] hantavirus infection occurred nationally so far this season [2012], 11 of which resulted in death.

The BioBio province has not been a stranger to the fatal statistics, with 2 people [dead] this year [2012], one of the cases in the Tucapel community and the other in Mulchen. The health authority reiterated its call to the populace to consider preventive measures [against contracting the infection].

[Although not specified, the hantavirus involved in this fatal case and the following ones is most likely Andes virus.

A young man died after becoming infected with [a] hantavirus in the Maujle region, bringing to 11 the number of fatal victims due to the disease so far this year [2012]. The patient who lost his life was 19 years old and had acquired the virus [infection] in an area near Lake Colbun, according to the Institute of Public Health [ISP]. The area where the infection was acquired is the Mirador Las Vizcachas sector, according to Radio Cooperativo.

In the entire country, 37 hantavirus [infection] cases have been registered in 2012. This year [2012], the ISP put into action a system that includes the use of the ELISA test for rapid diagnosis of the disease through specialized laboratories distributed around the country.

Hantavirus enters the body via the respiratory route. It is present in the excrement of infected wild long-tailed mice [long-tailed pygmy rice rats, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_], so the main preventive measure is to avoid places that have remained closed and weedy areas that might be used by these rodents.

[7] USA (Grant county, Washington state)

Grant County health officials announced today [6 Apr 2012] that the recent death of a local woman has been confirmed to be from [a] hantavirus infection. The woman, who was in her 30s, was hospitalized and died on 28 Mar [2012], a news release said.

County health district investigators determined she likely was exposed to the virus in Grant County.

Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is caused by a virus found in the urine, droppings, and saliva of infected rodents. Deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_] are the common carriers of the virus in Washington. People become sick when they breathe in air particles stirred up from rodent droppings or nests. The greatest risk occurs in places like sheds or cabins that are enclosed and have poor air circulation.

Symptoms appear 1-6 weeks after exposure and include fever, muscle aches and fatigue. Symptoms also can include headaches, dizziness, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pain.

Since the virus was recognized in 1993, Washington has had 44 reported cases and 15 deaths. The state sees about one to 5 cases per year.

Preventive measures include keeping homes, cabins, garages, sheds, workplaces or campsites clean and free from rodent droppings. Doors and windows should be left open for at least 30 minutes before cleaning to allow air to circulate in areas where deer mice might live. Gloves and masks should be worn to protect from exposure.

Health officials recommend against using vacuums, brooms, dusters or cleaning implements that might stir up dust and instead suggest wetting possibly contaminated areas with disinfectant or bleach solution and letting it soak for at least 10 minutes before cleaning.

Dead rodents, nesting materials and feces should be sprayed with disinfectant until soaked and then double-bagged along with cleaning materials.

Gloves should be disinfected before removal, and hands should be thoroughly washed.
