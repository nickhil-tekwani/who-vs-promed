Abstract
-------
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a viral infection of the central nervous system that occurs in many parts of Europe and Asia. Humans mainly acquire TBE through tick bites, but TBE occasionally is contracted through consuming unpasteurized milk products from viremic livestock. We describe cases of TBE acquired through alimentary transmission in Europe during the past 4 decades. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 410 foodborne TBE cases, mostly from a region in central and eastern Europe. Most cases were reported during the warmer months (April-August) and were associated with ingesting unpasteurized dairy products from goats. The median incubation period was short, 3.5 days, and neuroinvasive disease was common (38.9%). The clinical attack rate was 14% (95% CI 12%-16%), and we noted major heterogeneity. Vaccination programs and public awareness campaigns could reduce the number of persons affected by this potentially severe disease.

Discussion
------------
In conclusion, FB-TBE in Europe is reported mostly in a well-defined geographic region during tick season, with a few reports from Russia and recently in France. We found a variable FB-TBE attack rate, which might be the result of many factors, including variability in the viral load in the infected dairy products, compatible with a previous report. Clinical features of FB-TBE are similar to those reported for TBE acquired through tick bites, and CNS-specific symptoms develop in nearly 40% of infected persons. Vaccination seems to be effective in preventing FB-TBE. Our findings could help raise awareness of FB-TBE among epidemiologists, clinicians, public health officials, and the public in endemic areas. Vaccination programs and public awareness campaigns could greatly reduce the number of patients affected by this potentially severe CNS infection.

[This report illustrates the importance of taking a detailed history and consideration of food-borne transmission of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in the absence of a tick bite in geographic areas where the virus is endemic. However, it may be difficult to persuade unvaccinated people who are living in these areas to be vaccinated if they are consuming unpasteurized milk products. Although these individuals may not frequent localities where ticks are present, they need to understand that they are at risk of TBE virus infection. Implementation of public awareness campaigns in those areas, as suggested in the above report, is prudent. TBE virus is transmitted in many parts of Europe every year, so the need for the awareness campaign is ongoing. - Mod.TY
