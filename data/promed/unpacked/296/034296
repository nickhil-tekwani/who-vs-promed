Oilseed rape growers should be examining their crops for phoma disease as one site in Herefordshire is the first forecast to have hit the threshold level of 10% of the crop infected, which indicates the need to consider a spray treatment.

The forecast monitors temperature and rainfall, which simulate the development of _Leptosphaeria maculans_ [and] predicts the date when 10% of oilseed rape plants could potentially show symptoms of phoma leaf spot.

Catherine Harries, AHDB [Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board], says phoma onset appears to have started relatively early this [2019] autumn at some locations. There is a lot of variation across the country. Growers should treat susceptible varieties when thresholds are reached.

[Blackleg (also called phoma stem canker or leaf spot) is the most serious disease of oilseed rape with a possible yield loss of 50% or more. Severe disease is caused by the fungus _Phaeosphaeria sowerbyi_ (synonym _Leptosphaeria maculans_), while _Plenodomus biglobosus_ (synonym _L. biglobosa_) has been reported in association with milder symptoms. The disease can also affect other species in the Brassicaceae family (such as cabbages, turnip, some weeds), which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms on oilseed rape may include lesions on leaves, stems and pods, with stem cankers leading to premature ripening or collapse (lodging) of the crop. Root infections have also been reported (ProMED-mail post 20010819.1959). Symptomless infections may occur.

The fungi are seed borne and also spread by wind, splash dispersal, mechanical means (for example on contaminated equipment), and infected crop litter. They may overwinter in stubble, which is therefore often sprayed with fungicides. However, this does not eliminate the risk from remaining underground parts of infected plants. Disease management includes use of clean seed, cultural practices to minimise inoculum and fungicides.

Rapeseed cultivars with different levels of disease resistance are available and are placed into groups according to which resistance genes they carry (see link below). However, the pathogen is extremely diverse and new strains evolve frequently, both overcoming host resistances and developing new fungicide resistances. Pathogen adaptation may be counteracted by frequent changing of cultivars and/or mixing fungicides with different modes of action.

In the UK, resistance breakdown has been reported recently, with host resistance gene Rlm7 becoming less successful in disease control (ProMED-mail post 20180503.5782524). Host resistance is becoming increasingly important to growers since some fungicides have been disallowed for crop use.
