Rift Valley fever virus infection of a resident of Najran
---------------------------------------------------------
A 40 year old Saudi man, a fire fighter by profession and resident in
Najran, was diagnosed with Rift Valley fever on 28 Apr 2010. He first
reported signs of illness on 23 Apr 2010. The same day he presented at a
Ministry of Health facility in Najran, where he was hospitalised and
suspected to be a case of viral haemorrhagic fever. Signs observed included
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and epistaxis.

The patient's blood was sent to the Central Laboratory (Riyadh) and tested
for various viral haemorrhagic fevers (Rift Valley fever, Alkhurma
haemorrhagic fever, and dengue fever). All were negative except for Rift
Valley fever, which was detected using real time RT-PCR. Tests for Rift
Valley fever virus IgM and IgG were negative.

At the present time, the exact source and locale of Rift Valley fever virus
infection is not clear and is still being investigated. The patient
travelled extensively in the south western areas of the kingdom of Saudi
Arabia known to be endemic for Rift Valley fever (Tihama, Aseer, and Gizan)
some 45 days before the onset of his present illness. However, this
extended time frame does not seem compatible with the known incubation
period of Rift Valley fever virus (around 2 to 6 days). In addition, the
lack of antibodies (IgM or IgG) adds further doubt to the patient being
infected during that visit. The patient is also known to have visited a
livestock farm where he purchased an animal. It was then slaughtered and
cooked for him at a commercial outlet. He reported not taking part in the
slaughtering or cutting up process.

The Ministry of Health, in coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture
and local municipalities of Gizan, Najran, and Aseer, is conducting
extensive epidemiological and entomological investigations and results are
pending. Active surveillance for human and animal disease is ongoing.
Vaccination of animals with the live attenuated Rift Valley fever virus
vaccine is continuing in the said locales.

[Rift Valley fever is a viral zoonosis that can cause severe disease in a
low proportion of infected humans. The virus is classified in the genus
_Phlebovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_ and causes outbreaks of
abortions and deaths of young livestock (predominantly sheep, goats, and
cattle). Humans become infected from contact with infected tissues of
livestock, and less frequently from mosquito bites. The mosquitoes (and
biting flies) which transmit the virus generally prefer to feed on
livestock outdoors at night.

The virus was first identified in 1931 during an investigation into an
epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley of Kenya, hence its name.
Since then, extensive outbreaks have been reported in sub-Saharan and North
Africa. In 1997-98, a major outbreak occurred in Kenya, Somalia, and
Tanzania and subsequently in September 2000 Rift Valley fever was confirmed
in Saudi Arabia and Yemen (the 1st and only reported occurrence of the
disease out-with the African continent). Currently there is an ongoing
outbreak of Rift Valley fever in South Africa, which has been responsible
for several human deaths.

The source of the Saudi patient's exposure is unclear. Although he had
travelled in virus endemic areas of Saudi Arabia, his infection appears to
have been more recent. The majority of human infections result from direct
or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals, during
the handling of animals, slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal
births, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses. Certain occupational
groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians
are therefore at higher risk of infection. Other routes of transmission
include inhalation of aerosols produced during the handling and slaughter
of infected animals, by consumption of unpasteurized milk, and by insect
bites. No human-to-human transmission of Rift Valley fever virus infection
has been documented, and transmission to health care workers is not a
hazard provided standard infection control precautions are in place.
Further information on the source of the Saudi patient's infection is awaited.
