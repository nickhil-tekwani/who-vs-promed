2 cases of human metapneumovirus in immunocompromised patients in
Saudi Arabia
---------------------------------------------------------
Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) has recently been shown to be a
prominent cause of respiratory infections in immunocompromised hosts,
and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. It has been
increasingly associated with lower respiratory tract infection in
hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients, with mortality
rates up to 50 percent. We report the 1st 2 cases of hMPV pneumonia
in an allogenic peripheral SCT recipient presenting with respiratory
failure and sepsis syndrome in Saudi Arabia.

The 1st case is a 59 year-old patient with recurrent mantle cell
non-Hodgkin lymphoma who was admitted to the intensive care unit 10
days after he received chemotherapy, with bilateral pulmonary
infiltrates and septic shock, required mechanical ventilation,
inotropic support, and broad spectrum antibiotics. hMPV Multiplex PCR
[polymerase chain reaction] was the only identified organism on
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). His course was complicated with
spontaneous pneumothorax that was managed with tube thoracotomy. The
patient's condition continued to deteriorate with persistent
respiratory failure, shock syndrome, and acute renal failure
requiring continuous renal replacement therapy. The patient
eventually expired despite maximum support.

The 2nd case is a 20 year-old white male with a relapsed pre B-cell
acute lymphocytic leukemia requiring allogenic peripheral blood SCT 2
weeks prior to his admission to the intensive care unit with
hemoptysis, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and severe hypoxemia
requiring mechanical ventilation and broad spectrum antibiotics.
Culture results were all negative except for positive hMPV multiplex
PCR on BAL specimen. The patient's condition deteriorated despite
continued support and he eventually expired.

These 2 cases represent the 1st reported cases of hMPV in Saudi
Arabia in immunocompromised hosts. The 1st case illustrates that
spontaneous pneumothorax may complicate the course of the disease in
adults, as is the case in children.

[_Human metapneumovirus_ is a member of the genus _Metapneumovirus_ of
the sub-family _Pneumovirinae_ in the family _Paramyxoviridae_.

The defining member of this genus is turkey rhinotracheitis virus
(avian metapneumovirus), which is responsible for severe respiratory
disease in domestic fowl. The metapneumoviruses are distinguished from
the pneumoviruses (bovine RSV, human RSV, and pneumonia virus of mice)
principally by a genome inversion. The clinical symptoms of children
from whom the human metapneumovirus has been isolated are similar to
those caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, ranging
from upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and
pneumonia. It has been established that human metapneumovirus has been
circulating in humans for at least 50 years and like human RSV, is
prevalent worldwide.

The detection of human metapneumovirus RNA in 2 immunocompromised
stem cell recipient transplant patients is an interesting
observation, but it is unclear to what extent this is related to the
course of the illness suffered by these patients. It is unclear
whether the virus was introduced with the transplanted cells or was
resident in the patients receiving the transplant.

It would be interesting also to know what other respiratory viruses
were detectable by the multiplex PCR system employed by the authors
and can be excluded as causes of the pneumonia observed. - Mod.CP]
