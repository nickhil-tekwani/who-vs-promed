Following the successful eradication programme, there has been a relative absence of fly recovery reports. However, the Florida recruiting call for participants in a table-top exercise held from 24-25 Jan 2012 at the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) in Tallahassee (http://www.flsart.org/screwworm/index.jsp) revealed the following:

Florida has a long history with _Cochliomyia hominivorax_ (screwworm). Using sterile flies raised in a plant in Sebring, Florida, a joint state-federal program in the southeastern United States began in 1958. The 2-year campaign cost around USD 11 million, eliminating the annual USD 20 million in screwworm-related producer losses in the southeastern United Sates. In Florida, we continue to see screwworm in imported animals. Since 2000, we have seen 11 positive cases.

But the Key deer are unique and special, and, therefore, not available elsewhere for importing. However, OIE reports that this fly is present in Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic; set for 2015, see http://tinyurl.com/h4z4934.

According to Google Earth, the distance from Matanzas, Cuba to Big Pine Key, Florida is 184 km or 114 miles, a not impossible distance for a lucky female fly to be carried on a suitable wind. The question is not if but when this time.
