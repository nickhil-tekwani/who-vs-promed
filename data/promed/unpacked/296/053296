Malaria to Novgorod city imported from Tajikistan (Russia)
-------------------------------------------------
The 1st case of [imported] 3-day malaria [caused by _Plasmodium vivax_] was
registered in Novgorod oblast. According to the informational agency of
the City of Novgorod and Marina Pribitkina, the press secretary of State
Epidemiological surveillance center, a 63-year-old habitant of Borovichekiy
region [district] had been ill for 3 days in the beginning of April 2004.
The patient arrived in Novgorod from Tajikistan on October 2003. The
patient was hospitalized in the infectious unit of Borovicheskaya central
hospital (CRH) on 5 Apr 2004. The malaria parasites were also discovered
during medical assessment of her grandchildren: 2 girls (4 and 8 years old)
and a 5-year-old boy. The children are doing well after treatment.
According to Marina Pribitkina, the last case of 3-day malaria [_Plasmodium
vivax_] was registered in August 2003 in an inhabitant of Novgorod city.

[This article does not mention the suspected source of the infection, but
there is normally no malaria around Novgorod. _Plasmodium vivax_ in Russia
and the so-called Newly Independent States is _Plasmodium vivax hibernans_,
whose incubation period is 6-8 months, allowing infection in the autumn and
a clinical attack the following spring. The same subspecies of _Plasmodium
vivax_ was previously found in the Scandinavian countries. If the entire
family -- including the children -- visited Tajikistan in the autumn of
2003, they were probably all infected at the same time. The present
temperatures do not encourage transmission in the Novgorod area, so the
children were not infected by the index case. - Mod.NR/EP]
[The implication is that the children did not visit Tajikistan but were
infected at home by the grandmother, yet October temperatures in Novgorod
-- which is just south of St Petersburg and in roughly the same latitude
as Stockholm -- would have been too cold for mosquito
transmission. However, as there was a case of malaria in August 2003 in
Novgorod, perhaps there were infected mosquitoes in the city at that time.
I am assuming that the grandmother did not donate blood to the 3 children;
in some parts of Russia -- and Tajikistan -- outdated therapies such as red
cell transfusion "boosters" for sickly children are still in use. - Mod.JW]
