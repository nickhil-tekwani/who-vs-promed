Horses dying from equine encephalitis
-------------------------------------
Harnett County health officials are warning residents to protect themselves
and their horses against mosquitoes after 3 animals died from a dangerous
disease that can affect humans, in eastern sections of the county over the
past 3 weeks. Harnett County Health Director John Rouse said one horse was
found dead in a stable by the owner. Another died after signs were
discovered by the owner. The 3rd animal, an emu, died and the disease was
found in its blood.

The cause of all 3 deaths, which happened in areas near Dunn and Coats, was
determined to be equine encephalitis, a disease originally carried by
birds. Mosquitoes, which bite the birds, then pass the disease on to
horses, or potentially humans. Equine encephalitis causes swelling of the
lining of the brain, which eventually causes death. Mr Rouse said citizens
in all areas of the county need to take precautions to prevent the disease.

"These mosquitoes that carry this virus are out there and they are biting
people," Mr Rouse said. "It is something that is potentially dangerous,
especially for small children and the elderly." Mr Rouse said there is no
human vaccination for encephalitis, but people can survive the virus if
they are bit. "A normal, healthy person should be able to fight it off," he
said. "We just worry about people who are sick or are too young or old to
fight it off. It can do nothing, or it can make you real sick," Mr Rouse said.

Symptoms in humans vary, from minor to serious. Mild cases most often
result in flu-like symptoms such as a slight fever and sore throat. More
serious cases can lead to a sudden fever, seizures and eventually stroke.

Protecting horses
-----------------
About half of the encephalitis infections in humans are fatal. There are
usually 3 or fewer cases of the disease reported throughout the state each
year, most in eastern and coastal areas. Encephalitis is almost always
fatal in horses, and owners of the animals should take precautions.

"There is a vaccination for horses and owners need to have their horses
vaccinated," Mr Rouse said. The shot is administered by veterinarians and
requires an annual booster shot.

Signs of the disease in horses include erratic behavior, unsteadiness and
lack of coordination. Mr Rouse said there is little danger to other
animals, with the exception of large birds, such as the emu that died. "I
haven't heard of it in dogs and other outdoor animals, but that is not
saying it isn't possible," Mr Rouse said.

Controlling mosquitoes
----------------------
There is one answer to the problem, for both humans and animals, which is
to control the mosquito population. Mosquitoes can also carry the dangerous
West Nile virus, which has not been seen in the county so far this year.

"This is one of the wettest summers in a long time so there are a lot more
mosquitoes out there," Mr Rouse said. "The biggest thing people can do to
prevent these diseases is protect themselves and their property."

Citizens are asked to eliminate all areas in their yards where water can
gather. That includes small cups and containers where female mosquitoes
often lay their eggs. People are also advised to use a repellent containing
the chemical DEET and to wear protective clothing when outside. Mosquitoes
are particularly bad in the early morning and hours just before dark, so
residents are advised to limit outdoor time during those hours.

[Emus and other birds are sensitive to eastern equine encephalitis and can
die from the virus, as can horses. There is a vaccine for horses. The
immunization against eastern equine encephalitis is generally combined with
that for West Nile virus, so that one injection immunizes against both
diseases. Horse owners should ask for it. There are also appropriate
mosquito repellents for horses.

Horses cannot transmit the virus to owners or handlers. Mosquitoes carry
the virus. ­ Mod.TG
