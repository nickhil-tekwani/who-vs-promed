"Sparrow salmonella" [_Salmonella typhimurium_ type 160, a strain of
bacterial disease recorded in only 2 humans in New Zealand before last
year, accounted for 47 per cent of all gastroenteritis cases last month,
according to health officials.
The first two human cases of the bacterial disease were seen in New Zealand
in 1998 and 1999, but it hit 1802 people in 2000 -- including a 70 year old
Christchurch man who died -- and this year had affected 2275 by 14 Dec
2001. Doctors who have received the early results of a national Health
Ministry study of the _S. typhimurium_ type 160 outbreak have been able to
offer little in the way of new advice.
The ministry's chief public health adviser, Dr Bob Boyd, said early results
of the study simply reinforced the need to follow food safety and hand
hygiene advice. Salmonella is easily spread through personal contact and in
food, and the study of 117 cases between April and August showed that
victims were 4 times more likely than well people around them to have had
contact in the previous month with someone suffering from vomiting or diarrhea.
In humans, the strain causes fever, diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea,
lethargy, and vomiting. But Dr Boyd said victims of the infection were 30
times more likely than well people to have touched wild birds within 3 days
before their illness. The epidemic of _S. typhimurium_ type 160 in humans
followed its emergence among birds and animals, with increasing numbers of
dead sparrows reported throughout the country, along with blackbirds,
waxeyes, ducks, pheasants, and quail.
In a paper issued with his statement, Dr Boyd said that 918 eggs were
bought from Auckland supermarkets used by victims in the study who had
eaten raw eggs. No _S. typhimurium_ type 160 was found on those eggs.
Canterbury's medical officer of health, Mel Brieseman, said that this year
at least 11 cases had been linked to the handling or eating of raw eggs,
and 9 were _S. typhimurium_ 160.

[_Salmonella typhimurium_ type 160 is not a common isolate in human
infections. This article reports on an outbreak of _S. typhimurium_ type
160 in humans in association with an outbreak of _S. typhimurium_ type 160
in sparrows in New Zealand. This news article suggests that _S.
typhimurium_ is now circulating in the human population independent of
contact with infected birds.
A review of the literature revealed articles on the association of human
salmonellosis and birds. One prior outbreak is described in the third
reference. The Veterinary health unit in New Zealand in a 12 Feb 2000
publication (<http://www.gov.nf.ca/agric/pubfact/salmonella.htm>) mentioned
an outbreak of _S. typhimurium_ type 160 in songbirds in Central
Newfoundland, Canada in February-March 1999 as part of an alert for bird
feeders in the country.
In addition, a paper from the Veterinary Science Division, Avian Health
Unit, Ayr UK (SAC Veterinarian Science Unit)
(<http://www.bvpa.org.uk/papers/penn01wb.htm>) mentioned that _S.
typhimurium_ DT160 caused outbreaks of mortality in house sparrows in New
Zealand in 1999/2000. This paper also mentioned that there was evidence of
disease in humans (including one death), and in young farmed ducks and
quail, dogs and cats, deer, and horses.
More information on this outbreak from official sources would be
appreciated. - Mod.MPP
