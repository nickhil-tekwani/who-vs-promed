[There are 3 forms of mercury: elemental mercury, inorganic mercury, and
organic mercury.
Elemental mercury is also known as metallic mercury, liquid mercury, liquid
silver, and quicksilver and is an extremely heavy, odorless, silver-colored
liquid. Mercury exists as a natural element in the earth's crust. Since
this is the most likely form of mercury to which these children were
exposed, this comment is confined to the toxicity of elemental mercury.
There are several sources of elemental mercury in the home, including
broken mercury thermometers, broken fluorescent light bulbs, dental amalgam
fillings, mercury-containing latex paints, extraction of gold from ore
using mercury, and contaminated clothing from workers in thermometer-making
plants. Elemental mercury is also used as a Mexican folk medicine to treat
"empacho," a chronic stomach disorder.
Elemental mercury is the most commonly swallowed form of mercury, usually
from a broken thermometer. Fortunately, elemental mercury is not absorbed
from the stomach and will not cause any poisoning in a healthy person.
The swallowed mercury is slippery, and will roll into the stomach, out into
the bowels, and will be quickly eliminated without causing any symptoms.
However, if the person has severe inflammatory bowel disease or a fistula
(hole or opening) in their intestine, problems may result if the mercury is
not all cleared out, resulting in prolonged exposure.
Handling liquid mercury for a very short period of time usually does not
result in any problems. If there is approximately 8 [square] meters, the
probability of prolonged exposure seems likely. An allergic rash is
possible. Mercury is not well-absorbed through the skin, so skin contact is
not likely to cause mercury poisoning, especially with a brief one-time
exposure. Even if a person has cuts in the skin, mercury is too heavy to be
contained by a cut. Merely washing the wound well will remove the mercury.
Inhalation of elemental mercury vapors is the main cause of toxicity, as
mercury is well-absorbed through the lungs. Problems from inhalation
result either from a large one-time exposure or a long-term exposure. A
small, one-time exposure is not likely to cause problems. If the
contamination is 8 square meters, these children could have had some
significant inhalation.
The lungs are the primary target organ following a large, one-time
inhalation exposure of mercury vapor. Other signs and symptoms may develop
as well. Clinical signs develop within a few hours and include chills,
metallic taste, mouth sores, swollen gums, nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, headache, weakness, confusion, shortness of breath, cough,
chest tightness, bronchitis, pneumonia and kidney damage.
Long-term exposure of inhaled vapors is generally more dangerous, with the
nervous system being the primary target organ of toxicity. Symptoms may
occur within weeks but usually develop insidiously over a period of years.
Neurologic symptoms include tremors, headaches, short-term memory loss,
incoordination, weakness, loss of appetite, altered sense of taste and
smell, numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, insomnia, and excessive
sweating. Psychiatric effects are also seen after long-term exposure.
Acrodynia can result from repeated exposures to mercury-containing latex
paint fumes. Acrodynia is usually seen in younger children. The symptoms
include chills, sweating, body rash, irritability, sleeplessness, leg
cramps, swelling of the cheeks, nose, hands and feet, light sensitivity in
the eyes, and peeling skin layers on the palms of the hands and soles of
the feet.
People are regularly exposed to all 3 types of mercury, although the
organic type is the most likely to cause adverse health effects because of
its tendency to build up in the body.
Mercury vapor is very dangerous. Symptoms of mercury poisoning are
progressive. The 1st stage is paresthesia, distinguished by a tingling or
numb sensation in the fingers, toes, and face. Paresthesia may be followed
by difficulty walking and speaking, impaired vision and hearing, fatigue
and weakness, headache and trouble concentrating, and tremors.
Methods of detoxification or treatment are limited.
In this particular case, there may be some environmental cleanup issues. -
