Last week, 2 people died of Nipah virus at Manda upazila in Naogaon, said the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research today [2 Feb 2015]. "The 2 got infected with Nipah virus after consuming raw date juice. We are following up those who were in contact with the deceased," said Prof Dr Mahmudur Rahman, director at the IEDCR. A medical team from the IEDCR will travel to Manda tomorrow to monitor the situation, he said.

Rahman advised all not to drink raw date juice or fruits that might have been bitten by the bats as the virus spreads from bats. Nipah virus has a fatality rate of nearly 80 per cent and was 1st recorded in Bangladesh in 2001. Since then, it infected 284 people and caused the deaths of 200 people up to 25 Jan this year [2015], Dr Mahmudur Rahman told The Daily Star.

There is no vaccine for Nipah virus for either humans or animals. The primary treatment for human cases is intensive supportive care.

[Giant fruit bats or flying foxes (_Pteropus_ of several species) are reservoirs of Nipah virus and, as the above report indicates, they contaminate date palm sap or the fruit. This is the season for cases of Nipah virus infection to occur. The transmission season is usually January to April. As mentioned in comments in a previous post (ProMED-mail archive no. 20140113.2168940), local residents scarify the upper areas of palm trees to collect sap in large jars. The bats come to drink the sap, and defecate and urinate in the sap. If the bats are shedding Nipah virus, it contaminates the sap. If the sap is consumed uncooked, humans that drink it can become infected. Local people say that cooking the sap adversely alters the flavor. However, skirts made of local bamboo can serve as a barrier preventing bats' access to the sap collecting sites.

It is unfortunate that the public awareness efforts have not prevented these cases from occurring. Perhaps because cases are sporadic and geographically scattered, there is little public perception of risk of infection and serious disease. Until effective public education to prevent infection is implemented, sporadic cases will continue to occur.

Images of date palm sap collecting pots can be seen at the above URL.
