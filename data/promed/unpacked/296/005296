Thanks a lot for these always valuable summaries and comments on the Ebola catastrophe! Appreciated!

I know this is not a discussion group, but I would like to comment on the following:

The suggestion from MSF [Medecins Sans Frontieres] -- an organization which always avoided cooperation with the military in the field -- to bring in military medical support is a striking paradigm shift and it shows again the gravity of the situation.

The window of opportunity to contain the outbreak is closing fast -- as somebody commented quite impressively, but the international community is not reacting appropriately. Everybody is staring at the IS [Islamic State] terror and the Ukraine crisis, probably also because there is not the usual dramatic media coverage with shocking reports as the press people simply fear to go to the scenes [in West Africa] or are not allowed to, or simply can't go due to missing transport options.

I remember very well the international reaction to the tsunami in Banda Aceh [Indonesia] in 2004 where, after the wave was through, rapid deployable military field hospitals were falling over themselves in order to help the few injured survivors. After 4 weeks even the US Navy hospital ship Mercy arrived with 1000 beds.

As efficient NGOs like MSF are surrendering on the ground, pleading for more help, this disaster can only be stopped by military medical services, highly organized with rapid deployment capabilities, effective and fast logistics, command and control and the material ready to be deployed.

Medical services of western defense forces could enter under a humanitarian aid mandate of the UN. For example, the German Military Medical Service has been training its personnel for 15 years in barrier nursing, [and would] easily able to increase the capacity, political willingness permitting. [Also,] the US Navy hospital ships Mercy and Comfort could provide the urgently needed beds while dropping anchor at one of the iron piers in Monrovia [Liberia] harbor or ashore in Freetown [Sierra Leone].

Is anybody discussing these options? If not, why not? Does anybody have other proposals?

[A good map of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) situation in West Africa as of 3 Sep 2014 (before the case imported from Guinea to Senegal), showing functional and non-functional Ebola Treatment Centers and much other detail of labs, etc, is at http://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1866/westafrica_ebola_map4_090314.pdf.

I believe ProMED should make an exception and start a discussion on rapid response to the EVD pandemic (still euphemistically referred to as just an "outbreak" in some places). Many health authorities worldwide are subscribed to ProMED, and maybe we could hear all the reasons why field hospitals and hospital ships haven't been deployed weeks ago, besides "We haven't been asked". It would be valuable training for biodefense responders. - Mod.JW (My personal view, not necessarily that of all the ProMED team)
