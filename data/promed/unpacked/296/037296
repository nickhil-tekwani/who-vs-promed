Rapid onset of symptoms such as these suggest chemical poisoning. Heavy
metals and pesticides have caused similar symptoms in past incidents.
Cambodia experienced an incident of mercury dumping and subsequent
poisoning a couple of years ago in another coastal seaport town. The source
of the mercury was an industrial facility in Taiwan. Improper application
and disposal of pesticides have also resulted in contamination of public
water supplies in other developing nations.
The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, will contact the U.S. Agency for
International Development, Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, to obtain
additional information and to determine whether U.S. technical assistance
may be needed. We will keep ProMED-mail informed of our findings.

The attached article [below describes pesticide poisoning issues in
Cambodia. Symptoms are similar to those mentioned in the ProMED-mail
report. Because there are no listed industrial chemical production
facilities in the area where the poisoning incident occurred, my first
impression would be pesticide poisoning.

VOLUME 35, NO. 36, 26 Oct 1999
Pesticides illegal in some nations are poisoning farmers in Cambodia
PHNOM PENH, CAMBODIA: Chemical poisoning is a little-understood
occupational hazard for farmers in southeast Asia's poorest nation. A
recent United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) survey
indicated that as many as 90 percent of the country's farmers report
falling ill after using pesticides. (This includes minor symptoms such as
dizziness and nausea.) Most farmers are unaware pesticides can be dangerous
to humans, regarding them as medicine for crops, the survey found.
It also found many of the pesticides sold in Cambodia are among the most
toxic available in the world, and are beginning to be banned or restricted
in other countries. "The pesticides used here tend to be Category 1, the
most dangerous types, based on their World Health Organization (WHO)
classification," said Gary Jahn, a pest management specialist at the
International Rice Research Institute's Phnom Penh office.
Protective suits required for spraying such chemicals are not available in
this poor country. Warning labels are printed on bottles in foreign
languages, so farmers glean no reliable information on how to protect
themselves. Cambodians often spray in normal clothing, with only a
traditional scarf around their faces. Jahn said scarves worsen the
situation, acting like a wick to draw in chemicals.
The multinational firms that make the chemicals claim they are not
responsible because they do not directly market to Cambodia. Most of them
do business in neighboring Thailand and Vietnam, where independent
merchants buy the pesticides and sell them in Cambodia.
Methamidophos is a restricted chemical in some developed countries. Both
methyl parathion and methamidophos are legal in Thailand, but their use is
under review. Unofficial brokers who sell them to farmers in Cambodia
provide no warnings of the danger. Because the government is attempting to
rebuild a war-shattered infrastructure, it is unable to regulate the
unofficial inflow of products, pesticides included.

[Although this news account is over a year old, it provides excellent
background. The current poisoning involves schoolchildren and teachers, not
farmers. The mechanism is of exposure is different, but the chemicals and
their availability remains the same. High concentrations in communal
drinking water would intoxicate these children and teachers. - Mod.TG

Methyl parathion and methamidophos are 2 common pesticides used in
Cambodia, where poisonings are common. These pesticides are banned or
restricted in many other countries, such as China, the U.S., Japan,
Malaysia, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. Distribution and use (or misuse) is
not restricted in Cambodia.
Acute symptoms reported in the previous ProMED-mail article are consistent
with those experienced by victims in previous organophosphate pesticide
poisonings. Delayed sequelae include limb paralysis (24-96 hours
post-exposure) and peripheral neuropathy (2-4 weeks post-exposure). Since
the source of the poisonings appears to have been a communal drinking water
basin, chemical contamination could have occurred very easily.
Sources of information about the pesticides mentioned include U.S.
Department of Agriculture Pesticide Information Profiles and an article
published by Medical Post.

The third source may be found most easily by searching for "pesticides in
Cambodia" on Lycos and selecting the article published by Medical Post.
The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry has a case Study in
Environmental Medicine for Cholinesterase-Inhibiting Pesticide Toxicity and
a Medical Management Guideline for Parathion. These references may be
obtained by calling ATSDR's toll-free number: 1-888-42A-TSDR.
We have passed on ProMED-mail's report to the U.S. Agency for International
Development's Asia Desk. Requests from the host nation for U.S. Government
assistance will be coordinated through the U.S. Ambassador to Cambodia and
USAID.
