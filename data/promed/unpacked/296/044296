A strain of the Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) virus, responsible for causing
one of the most contagious animal diseases, first appeared in northern
India a decade ago, a newspaper report said in London.
The virus responsible for the current outbreak of FMD in British animals,
reached Britain after a 10-year spread across the Middle East, Asia and the
southern tip of Africa, The Times quoted an analysis published in
Veterinary Record by a team from Pirbright Laboratory of the Institute for
Animal Health.
It said the pan-Asia strain first appeared in northern India in 1990 and
spread to Saudi Arabia, probably through the trade in live sheep and goats,
and then into neighboring countries. By 1996, it was in Turkey, from where
it reached Greece and Bulgaria.
From India it spread east and west -- to Nepal in 1993 and 1994, Bhutan in
1998, Tibet and Hae in China in 1999. Pan-Asia's final port of call before
reaching Britain was South Africa, near Durban, the report said. Its 2
biggest conquests in the far east were Japan and Korea. Japan had been free
of FMD since 1908, and Korea since 1934 and both have strict rules covering
animal and meat imports.
According to Prof Chris Bostock, director of the Institute for Animal
Health, the disease shows a preference for pigs which leads to a massive
production [viral replication] of itself.
