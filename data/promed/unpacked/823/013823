The Center for Disease Control is reporting 641 cases of _Cyclospora_ across 11 states, including Pennsylvania, that are connected to bagged salad mixes.

The CDC reports 2 _Cyclospora_ cases related to the recalled products in Pennsylvania as [24 Jul 2020]. The locations of the cases were not disclosed in the CDC's data. The CDC says that it is specifically examining salad ingredients (iceberg lettuce, carrots, red cabbage) for the purposes of its investigation. The affected products include salad mixes made by Fresh Express, Hy-Vee Inc., Little Salad Bar, Signature Farms, Marketside, and Hy-Vee. The products were sold at ALDI, Giant Eagle, Hy-Vee, Jewel-Osco, ShopRite, and Walmart locations.

The products were manufactured in Streamwood, Illinois at a Fresh Express production facility. Besides Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, Vermont, Wisconsin, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia are all potentially impacted by the _Cyclospora_ contamination.

"Cyclosporiasis is an intestinal infection caused by the _Cyclospora_ parasite," the CDC says. "A person may become infected after ingesting contaminated food or water. Common symptoms include severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, body aches, and fatigue. The infection is treated with antibiotics and most people respond quickly to treatment."

Specifically, the CDC says the products with a Z178 code or lower and "Best by" date that runs through [14 Jul 2020] are the ones potentially affected by the contamination.

However, only Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Wisconsin have reported cases of _Cyclospora_ related to eating the salad mix. According to the CDC, the dates of the illness range from [11 May 2020 to 5 Jul 2020], with 37 people hospitalized as of Friday [24 Jul 2020]. Patients are ages 10 to 92 years with a median age of 59 years as of Friday's data. No related deaths have been reported. People can go 4 to 6 weeks before noticing any symptoms of _Cyclospora_, the CDC says.

The CDC issued its recall warnings [19 Jun 2020], and Giant Eagle issued a recall on its Fresh Express products on [29 Jun 2020]

As far as we know, cyclosporiasis does not have an animal reservoir. Therefore, infections transmitted through food must have been in contact with feces from an infected human or water contaminated with the cysts from human feces.

Multi-location outbreaks have been frequent in the USA and Canada in recent years (see archives below) and are a demonstration of how easily a foodborne infection can spread when food manufacture is centralised. - Mod.EP
