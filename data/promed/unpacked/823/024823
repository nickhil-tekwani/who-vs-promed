A child being treated for enterovirus 68 at Children's Medical Center of Dallas [Texas] is now paralyzed in his right arm, hospital officials said on Thursday [2 Oct 2014].

The boy is expected to undergo physical therapy and will be released from the hospital soon.

Enterovirus 68 is a respiratory illness which has affected children across the country this year [2014].

According to the Associated Press, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told doctors to be alert for a "polio-like" virus. So far Colorado has seen 10 cases where children became paralyzed.

Four people in Denver have also been treated for the mysterious symptoms, according to the Associated Press.

So far enterovirus has been linked to 4 deaths in the nation.

A child was treated at a Long Beach hospital for enterovirus D68 [EV-D68], marking the 1st confirmed case of a virus that's been spreading across the nation to be diagnosed in Los Angeles County [California].

A child treated for partial paralysis at Children's Hospital Los Angeles has tested positive for enterovirus D-68, health officials announced Wednesday [1 Oct 2014].

The case is the 2nd announced in the last 24 hours in Los Angeles County, which previously had not confirmed any infections with the virus, which has been associated with severe respiratory symptoms in some children and, in rare cases, neurologic symptoms [I believe they are referring to a 2nd case of EV-D68, not a 2nd case of paralysis associated with EV-D68 infection - Mod.MPP].

The city of Long Beach reported a case of EV D-68 infection on Tuesday night [30 Sep 2014].

Speaking with reporters Wednesday [1 Oct 2014], the hospital's infectious diseases chief, Dr. Grace Aldrovandi, said that the child, who was between 5 and 10 years of age, arrived at the hospital in August [2014] with trouble moving a limb.

The child had cold symptoms for the previous week, Aldrovandi said, which resolved normally. The child has been discharged from the hospital but still has some paralysis, she added.

Aldrovandi reiterated the official recommendation for preventing the spread of EV D-68, which includes frequent hand washing and avoiding people who are sick.

Health officials believe EV D-68 is probably widespread and only causes severe illness rarely, but public health agencies will have to study the virus further to confirm its prevalence in the community and why it sometimes, like other enteroviruses, causes severe illness, said Jeffrey Gunzenhauser, interim health officer for Los Angeles County.

A strain of enterovirus could be to blame for a mysterious paralysis taking over a San Diego [California] boy's arm.

[An 8-year-old boy] was hospitalized late last month [August 2014] for what doctors initially thought was pneumonia, though one big symptom suggested it was not just a respiratory illness.

He developed pain in the back of his neck, head and arm, his father told NBC 7 in an exclusive interview.

When a regimen of antibiotics did nothing, [his] parent took him back to the emergency room as paralysis set in to his right arm.

"After some time, he lost all the ability to move his arm. He's still in the hospital at that time, and they suspected it was a polio-like virus," said [his father].

Tests revealed [the boy] had contracted enterovirus, but doctors say the disease left his body before they could confirm if it was the strain D68, which has sickened children across 22 states.

[His father] said San Diego County health officials are investigating whether enterovirus caused the polio-like symptoms that have left [the boy] unable to move more than his right hand.

[The boy's] case is similar to 10 others reported in Colorado, where patients have either weakness or paralysis in arms or legs. Four of them have tested positive for [EV-D68].

While doctors prescribed physical therapy as a possible cure, the recovery rate for his paralysis is very low, according to [his father].

"The long term prognosis is not great. It's not encouraging. But at the same time, I am hopeful, and we're going to do all we can as far as physical therapy and whatever else we can think of," he said. The family has opened a support fund to raise money for [his] treatment.

[His] mother told NBC 7 she hopes other cases will be diagnosed much quicker. She thinks doctors should run tests right away when a child complains of stiffness in the neck or headaches.

[The boy], a baseball and piano player, is remaining positive and has begun homeschooling while he recovers. "And he's determined to use his left hand, his left arm, writing with his hand, throwing with his left hand," [his father] said.

The father said he wants other parents to be aware of head and neck pain in their own children, as do public health officials. They are asking emergency rooms and pediatricians across the US to watch for paralysis or weakness in patients and report it to local health departments.

In the past, EV-71 was the strain known to cause paralysis, not EV-68. Doctors explained to Christopher that like polio, many people are infected with enterovirus without ever developing symptoms. Only random cases could progress into severe respiratory problems or paralysis.

Three children from San Diego County and one visiting from Ventura tested positive for EV-68, the 1st cases reported in California this year [2014].

The CDC has confirmed that a paralyzed child at University of Michigan C.S. Mott Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor has tested positive for enterovirus D68.

The case is one of 25 in Michigan.

Doctors have noticed that several other children with limb weakness and paralysis have also tested positive for the virus, but the CDC is still working to determine a direct link.

The CDC says the virus has been confirmed in 472 people in 41 states and the District of Columbia.

The virus can cause mild to severe illness, with the worst cases needing life support for breathing difficulties. The strain isn't new but it's rarely seen.

Michiganders can protect themselves from enterovirus by taking general hygiene precautions:

- Wash hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds, especially after changing diapers.
- Cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing.
- Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
- Avoid kissing, hugging, and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick.
- Disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as doorknobs, especially if someone is sick.

The Virginia Department of Health has received one report of a child developing acute neurological illness similar to the limb weakness reported in a cluster of 9 [now 10] Colorado children sickened by a severe respiratory illness.

Health officials continue to investigate a link between paralysis or weakness and infection with enterovirus D68, which is afflicting children across the country.

The Virginia child is from the northern health region, said Dr. Laurie Forlano, Virginia state epidemiologist.

"We've had one report of what seems like some compatible illness. That information has been passed on to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]."

The CDC on [26 Sep 2014] sent out an advisory to health care providers to be alert for acute paralysis in children infected with enterovirus D68 after health care providers in Colorado reported the cluster of cases.

So far, the only CDC lab-confirmed enterovirus D68 cases in Virginia are from the central health region.

Nationally, enterovirus D68 infections have been confirmed in 42 states and the District of Columbia.

Alabama health officials on Tuesday [30 Sep 2014] confirmed a 5th case of the enterovirus D68 respiratory illness and said they are looking into "an unknown neurological illness" seen in a few children across the country.

Dr. Mary McIntyre, state epidemiologist with the Alabama Department of Public Health, said officials have not confirmed the neurological symptoms, and that the state has only received information on one child.

The neurological symptoms include muscle weakness and paralysis, according to news reports. The department is asking doctors to be on the lookout for the symptoms.

McIntyre said that as of Tuesday, 40 people had been evaluated for the virus, and 9 patients in hospitals had been tested. Of those 9, 5 have tested positive for enterovirus D68. This includes the 4 cases confirmed last month [September 2014], McIntyre said.

But that doesn't mean there are only 5 cases of the virus in the state. The state is only testing a few of the most severe cases that have met key criteria, because the state lab does not have the capability to test for each suspected case. She encouraged doctors to call 1-800-338-8374 prior to sending specimens to the state for testing.

Dr. John McLendon, a pediatrician with Enterprise Pediatrics, said his practice likely saw several cases of the virus in asthmatic patients between mid-August [2014] and mid-September [2014], when a larger-than-usual number of children came in with respiratory problems.

"Children came in with really bad asthma flares," McLendon said. "We don't have a good way to test for enterovirus, but there was definitely something going on and that makes the most sense."

While the virus does not have a cure, it can be treated with rest and fluids and medication that relieves symptoms. Asthma patients should take their controller medications to prevent attacks, he said.

McLendon said the number of patients coming in with severe respiratory problems seems to have slowed in recent weeks, however.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said symptoms of the illness include fever, runny nose, sneezing, cough and body and muscle aches. Severe symptoms may include wheezing and difficulty breathing.

The virus can be found in an infected person's saliva, mucus or sputum, according to the CDC website. It spreads from person to person when an infected person coughs, sneezes or touches surfaces.

Prevention is still the best defense, said McIntyre. To keep from getting sick, residents are advised to wash hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and warm water, stay home when sick and sanitize frequently used objects and appliances, such as doorknobs.

Alberta Health Services (AHS) says it's investigating 4 cases of paralysis in children, but the patients have not been diagnosed with enterovirus D68.

Provincial health officials in British Columbia are trying to determine if a man and boy with the illness developed paralysis-like symptoms because of the infections. Doctors are watching the 2 cases but say it's too soon to say if the virus is the cause.

Alberta health officials say there has been no paralysis in any of the 50 confirmed EV-D68 cases in the province -- 29 of which are in Calgary -- but they are keeping a close eye on 4 pediatric patients to see if there is a link.

Symptoms to watch for:
- Stiff neck
- Difficulty breathing
- High fever
- A child not acting like themselves

The patients were admitted to the Alberta Children's Hospital over the past week for assessment.

"It could be limb weakness or some facial weakness," said Dr. Judy MacDonald, Calgary's medical officer of health.

"With those 4 cases, we do not know if this is enterovirus D68. Some of them have tested positive for entero-rhinovirus but there's additional testing that will need to be done."

MacDonald says she has also heard reports of 2 cases in the Edmonton [Alberta] area.

The Public Health Agency of Canada says rhinovirus infections are the cause of about 50 per cent of all common colds and asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases exacerbations, and most are "mild and self-limited."

MacDonald says they are still in the very early stages of testing. Treatments include medications that help the immune system to function better and other supportive treatments, like intravenous fluids and additional oxygen to help with breathing.

She says a spike in respiratory viruses in children is common in September, but a cluster of cases of paralysis like this is very rare.

"It is the season where we start to coughs and colds, and those type of virus infections," said MacDonald, adding the flu vaccine for this year will be available shortly.

To reduce exposure to Enterovirus D68, AHS recommends Albertans:
- Wash their hands on a regular basis
- Keep their hands away from their face
- Avoid people who are sneezing or coughing
- Stay home if you are sick

If a child is exhibiting signs of extreme muscle weakness, contact a doctor immediately.

Dr. Gregory Taylor, Canada's chief medical officer of health, says it's not uncommon for the respiratory virus EV-D68 to cause mild inflammation of the spinal cord, which can cause temporary paralysis.

[On Fri 26 Sep 2014, the CDC issued an advisory looking for cases of neurologic illness with the following case definition: Patients less than or equal to 21 years of age with acute onset of focal limb weakness occurring on or after 1 Aug 2014; and an MRI showing a spinal cord lesion largely restricted to grey matter (see Polio-like illness - USA (02): (CO) enterovirus 68 susp, alert, RFI 20140927.2809908). That alert was issued in response to reports of a cluster of 9 cases meeting that definition in Colorado.

Since then, with active surveillance in place, more and more cases are being identified that match the above given case definition. In the reports above, new suspected cases have been reported from Texas (1 case), California (2 cases), Michigan (1 case), Virginia (1 case) and Alabama (1 suspected case that hasn't been confirmed by the state as yet). After the initial post of the cases in Colorado, ProMED-mail received a 1st hand report from the British Columbia, Canada Department of Health of 2 cases that met the case definition (see Polio-like illness - North America: Canada (BC) 20140930.2819618). In the above media reports, there is a report coming from Alberta, Canada of a possible 4 additional cases that match the case definition.

What is striking about these reports is a description of a polio-like illness, although in most cases where the information has been available, the description of the neurologic involvement has been described as a "partial paralysis" and also has been described to be more frequently involving the upper extremities. This may be an erroneous interpretation on my part, as with the exception of the report coming from British Columbia, the other reports were media reports with selected interviews and descriptions of some of the cases, but not each one. That being said, the preliminary reports do appear to be a polio-like illness with involvement of the anterior horn cells as seen with poliovirus infection.

In more than one report, there is mention that with the absence of identification of the enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) from specimens from spinal fluid (CSF), it suggests that the virus may not be involved as the etiologic agent associated with this polio-like illness. Poliovirus is less frequently identified in CSF. The majority of poliovirus isolations have come from stool specimens. Since both poliovirus and EV-D68 are members of the enterovirus family, one might expect to have a higher yield of virus isolation from stool specimens, especially after the respiratory component of the illness is over (remembering that the clinical descriptions have suggested the onset of paralysis occurred after the upper respiratory infection in many of the cases).

It would be of interest to know, in those children with evidence of EV-D68 infection and neurologic complications, what type of specimen was positive for the virus (respiratory tract, stool, CSF), and if from respiratory secretions, whether there was ongoing respiratory illness at the time the specimen was taken. It would also be of interest to know if serologic studies have been performed (acute and convalescent serology) to see if there has been recent infection with EV-D68.

As a reminder, in February 2014 there was a report of a series of polio-like illnesses reported in California that occurred during an 18-month period preceding the report. 5 of the approximately 25 identified cases in California were presented at the American Academy of Neurology meeting on Tue 29 Apr 2014: Roux A, Lulu S, Waubant E, Glaser C, VanHaren K. Polio-Like Syndrome in California: Clinical, Radiologic, and Serologic Evaluation of Five Children Identified by a Statewide Laboratory over a Twelve-Months Period (available at: http://www.abstracts2view.com/aan/view.php?nu=AAN14L1_P3.335).

Abstract:
"Objective: To report the recent experience with polio-like syndrome among children identified in California's Neurologic and Surveillance Testing program.

"Background: Although poliovirus has been eradicated from most of the globe, other viruses can also injure the lower motor neurons of the spine, leading to a polio-like syndrome. In the past decade, newly identified strains of enterovirus have been linked to polio-like outbreaks among children in Asia and Australia. In 2012, the authors observed a cluster of polio-like cases among children at their medical centers and sought to systematically describe similar cases throughout the state of California.

"Design/Methods: We reviewed all polio- like cases among children who had biological samples referred to California's Neurologic and Surveillance Testing program from August 2012 to July 2013. Our inclusion criteria were acute onset of flaccid paralysis affecting one or more limbs with abnormal MRI imaging of the spinal cord sufficient to explain the clinical findings. We excluded children who met criteria for Guillain-Barre syndrome and botulism.

"Results: We identified 5 children who developed a polio-like syndrome with lower motor neuron injury. All children presented with acute flaccid paralysis of one or more limbs that reached peak severity within 48 hours of onset. Three children had a prodromal respiratory illness. All had been previously vaccinated against polio-virus. Spine MRIs revealed non-enhancing T2 hyperintensities of the central gray matter while CSF was normal to mildly pleocytotic. They were treated with steroids, IVIG and/or plasma exchange with no apparent clinical benefit. Recovery of motor function was poor at 6-month follow-up. Two children tested positive for enterovirus-68, a rare virus previously associated with polio-like symptoms.

"Conclusions: These cases highlight the possibility of an emerging infectious polio-like syndrome in California. This has important implications for disease surveillance, testing, and treatment."

I can't help but wonder if these cases are being reviewed again now in light of the forward looking active surveillance, and if perhaps the case definition for investigation should not put the date limit of date on onset "on or after 1 Aug 2014".
