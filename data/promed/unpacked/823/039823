The Ministrty of Agriculture on Friday [5 May 2006] confirmed another case
of bird flu outbreak among wild birds in a remote area of north west
China's Qinghai Province.
17 bar-headed geese were found dead on a wetland in Yushu County on 23 Apr
2006. [Picture of _Anser indicus_ at
<http://www.indianwildlife.org/images/birds/bar-headed-goose.jpg>] The
number of dead wild birds had risen to 125 by Thursday [4 May 2006], of
which 123 were bar-headed geese, the ministry said on its website. The
national bird flu laboratory on Wednesday confirmed that the dead birds had
tested positive for the H5N1 strain, a highly contagious virus strain that
had killed 12 people in the country.
The place where the outbreak happened is a high and cold area, located more
than 800 km away from Xining, the provincial capital, and Qinghai Lake,
which is an important habitant of a vast number of migrant birds.
Yushu County, the nearest human residential area, is also more than 60 km
away. [For a map of the Yushu/Gyegu area, see
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CH/6/Gyegu.html>].
The county has only sparse population and no poultry/domestic fowls are fed
nearby, said the ministry. No bird flu outbreak was reported in the
province's domestic fowls.
The province's veterinary departments has sterilized the area [which area?
by what means? - Mod.AS] and is keeping a close eye on any new cases, said
the ministry.
Nearby livestock have been transferred to summer pastures far from the
outbreak location. Local authorities have demanded local herdsmen keep a
distance from the dead birds to prevent the virus from [infecting] human
beings.
The outbreak is the 2nd case found in the province in a month after a dead
bar-headed goose in Gangcha County was found carrying the deadly virus last
Saturday [29 Apr 2006].
The mainland and Hong Kong will host a joint exercise to test their ability
to cope with the flu pandemic, reported the Hong Kong-based South China
Morning Post.

[The bar-headed goose (_Anser indicus_) is known to breed in Central Asia
and migrate over the Himalayas to winter in the wetlands of India. Could
the affected birds have recently returned from H5N1-affected areas in
India? The input of knowledgeable sources (ornithologists?) might help. -

Authorities Thursday [4 May 2006] culled over 6000 chicks and chicken birds
following outbreak of avian influenza strains at 2 more poultry farms in
north eastern and south eastern cities of Pakistan, said sources.
The new outbreak was confirmed at 2 poultry farms in the Teratt area of
Murree, about 35 kilometres north east of Islamabad, and Sialkot, 400
kilometres south east of Islamabad, sources at Federal Food and Agriculture
Ministry told KUNA.
They said following suspicions of bird flu virus, blood samples of chickens
were sent to the National Laboratory in Islamabad. "The Laboratory results
Thursday confirmed outbreak of H5N1 deadly virus", they added.
Sources said more than 6000 chicks and chicken birds have been culled so
far, adding that the process was still continuing. Earlier, following H5N1
outbreak at 13 farms in the outskirt of Islamabad, 2 in North West Frontier
Province (NWFP), and one in eastern Hafizabad district, over 60 000

[Pakistan's last follow-up report to the OIE, dated 4 Apr 2006 (see
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/aIS_24.htm#Sec12>) included the
following comments:
- no new outbreaks have been reported or observed from anywhere in the
country; the disease did not spread and remained confined to 2 farms;
- as a precautionary measure, the private sector has been allowed to import
5 million doses of avian influenza vaccine to deal with any eventual emergency.
A new update might be anticipated. - Mod.AS]

[2] EU preventive measures

The European Union has decided to extend strict safety measures to guard
against the spread of the bird flu virus, acknowledging that the [danger]
has not yet passed. EU veterinary experts endorsed a European Commission
plan to prolong surveillance of poultry farms and restriction on the
movement and sale of poultry in high-risk areas until the end of July 2006.
France received permission to keep vaccinating birds. The country has been
inoculating birds, above all ducks, in an effort to secure sales.

[The above information is based upon the following EU press release of 4
May 2006: "Avian Influenza : standing committee backs a series of measures:
The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health backed on 4 May
several European Commission proposals to prolong certain measures aimed at
preventing and controlling the spread of avian influenza in the EU until
the end of the year. A decision to give France more time to complete their
vaccination programme and a decision relating to a vaccination programme of
avian species in zoos in Austria were also endorsed by the Committee." -
