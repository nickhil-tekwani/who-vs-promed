Sheep graziers across New South Wales (NSW) are being warned that an outbreak of virulent footrot is spreading, despite dry seasonal conditions. Graziers have also been told that the risk of infection from new stock purchases is also a possibility.

Key points:
- highly infectious bacterial disease of the hoof in sheep and goats
- causes serious production losses and control costs
- legally notifiable disease, requiring quarantine
- normally associated with moist or wet conditions
- dozens of sheep properties across western NSW have been quarantined amid a worrying outbreak of the disease that rots away the animal's foot.

Footrot is a bacterial infection of the hoof, known to be more prevalent in wet conditions but authorities say they are receiving reports of continuing infection spread despite the dry conditions. Local Land Services veterinarian Jillian Kelly said the NSW central west was a particular hot spot, with about 45 properties under quarantine. "That equates to about 150 000 sheep in our region," she said. "But we have been talking to other regions and they are all experiencing an increase in prevalence."

Dr Kelly said many sheep producers had not seen incidents of footrot in their flocks for years. She said some were not as familiar with the signs as farmers might have been during times of high prevalence in the 1980s and 1990s. "The other thing we are seeing at the moment is that the signs are not as extreme as people might be expecting,'' Dr Kelly said. "Back in the '80s and '90s, when footrot was everywhere, the signs would make the sheep really lame."

"What we are finding this time around is that the sheep are not that lame, sometimes it doesn't smell as bad as it used to, people might be fooled into thinking it's something else. The signs might be quite mild, but it is still virulent footrot and it still has to be reported and controlled." Dr Kelly said the Central West Local Land Services was operating at full capacity to deal with the outbreak and that extra staff had been put on to deal with the outbreak.

"We are also seeing footrot at livestock sale yards in the region on a regular basis and that is quite concerning." She said there was concern about what might happen if spring rain caused the outbreak to worsen.

[Footrot is generally classified as either virulent or benign. This outbreak is classified as virulent, by the regulatory definition. This means the disease is quite debilitating, and painful. When diseases affecting the feet are so severe, then the sheep often lose weight, have poor growth rates, and suffer from poor wool quality and growth. Debilitated animals are generally susceptible to more fly strikes, and more severe fly strikes, which are often from the blow fly. This will reduce the value of the animal. Controlling the fly strikes as well as controlling the disease can be a costly process for the producer.

Footrot is a contagious bacterial disease of sheep and goats, caused by the organism _Dichelobacter nodosus_ (_D. nodosus_) in association with a number of other bacteria. This particular bacterium affects sheep and goats with similar disastrous consequences. The severity, the virulence, and the contagious nature make this disease notifiable or reportable to the authorities (the Department of Primary Industries).

As the article noted, this produces lameness as it is quite painful, and is often associated with an odor. Generally producers recognize the horrible odor and have a diagnosis almost from the smell. But if the odor is reduced this year it may be harder to recognize the cause.

We wish these producers well at early detection and prevention of this disease. - Mod.TG
