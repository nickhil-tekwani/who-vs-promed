A quarantine of [a trainer's] barn at the Evangeline Training Center
in Carencro is in place after a horse based there tested positive for
equine herpes, Louisiana State Racing Commission executive director
Charles Gardiner said Thursday [31 Dec 2009].

Horses living in that barn are being tested and won't be allowed to
ship elsewhere to race until the quarantine is lifted, Gardiner said.
Those horses will be allowed to train after regular training hours.
[This is a very dangerous disease, and horses suspected of having it
should not be training. Mod.TG]

"We're taking all the precautions necessary," Asmussen said.

Other horses based at the training center will be allowed to ship to
Louisiana tracks, including the Fair Grounds, to race, Gardiner said.
Handlers of those horses must bring proof that the horses had a
recent certified veterinary inspection and a recent herpes
vaccination. Also, the horses must show a normal temperature reading
upon arrival.

Officials of the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry are
monitoring the situation and satisfied with how it is being handled,
Gardiner said.

Equine herpes, a viral disease that can change into a neurological
condition, is contracted through the air or by direct contact.

Last season at the Fair Grounds, 2 adjacent barns were quarantined
for 3 weeks after a filly tested positive for equine herpes.
