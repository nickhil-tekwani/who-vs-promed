The lot of wage labourers and marginal farmers working in [West
Bengal] potato fields did not improve despite spiralling potato prices.

Small farmers could not get the best of a good harvest last year
[2008]. They sold their produce at a much lower price to the
middlemen as the crop was badly hit by wart disease.

Demands of the farmers [include] subsidised rates for fertiliser and
seed potatoes.

[Potato wart disease is caused by the fungus _Synchytrium
endobioticum_, which is considered one of the most important
pathogens of the crop. It is endemic in Europe and also reported from
a number of locations in the Americas, Australasia, and Africa. The
pathogen can also affect tomato and some solanaceous weeds and has
been included in the quarantine lists of the European Plant
Protection Organisation (EPPO).

On infected tubers, 'eyes' develop into characteristic warty,
cauliflower-like swellings. If infected early, the whole tuber can be
replaced by a warty proliferation. Warts darken with age, and
eventually rot and disintegrate. Diagnosis requires laboratory
confirmation as similar symptoms can be caused by other pathogens.
The fungus goes through cycles of proliferation and reinfection as
long as cool, wet conditions prevail and is therefore less damaging
in warm, light, well drained soils.

The disease is spread with soil (for example on farm tools), by
infected seed tubers, and also in manure from animals fed on infected
potatoes. The fungus can survive in soil for up to 40 years in the
absence of a host. There are several pathotypes (defined by their
virulence on different host cultivars), and potato varieties
resistant to a number of them have been developed. However, new
pathogen strains are emerging compromising the efficacy of host plant
resistance. Disease management is based on the control of pathogen
spread since fungicides are ineffective.

In India, the disease was first reported in 1953 in the Darjeeling
Hills on potatoes imported from the Netherlands. In 1961, a potato
research station was established to combat wart disease, which
developed hybrid potato varieties suitable to local conditions with
resistance to wart. Whether new pathogen strains have now emerged
overcoming available resistance, or whether resistant varieties were
not available to the farmers mentioned above is unclear.
