About 5000 orange growers of lower Assam's Kamrup district have been facing [a] crisis. It is famous for Khasi mandarin (_Citrus reticulata_), and this special variety is now on the verge of being wiped out.

Over the last 3 to 4 years, all my plants have been hit by diseases," laments a farmer. "Initially the crown leaves turn yellow. Then [the] whole plant gradually dries up and finally withers completely. The roots are decaying and stinking." New plants too were infected. For another farmer, about 100 plants of a total 550 have already been destroyed. "The 8 year old plants started to die just after flowering. Fruit output has also declined. Every year the problem is getting aggravated."

Experts from New Delhi were also shocked to observe the crop devastation. Orange cultivation in Boko spreads over 3226 hectares [7972 acres]. Disease has so far destroyed 1300 hectares [3212 acres] . "Yearly output has declined by about 40 per cent," Agriculture Department sources say.

Bhadeshawr Boro, Centre of Excellence Citrus, says, "The menace warrants in-depth exploration to arrest its further expansion. We have to take immediate steps to preserve the mother plants of this quality orange variety."

[Numerous diseases of citrus are being reported from the region, as well as multifactorial 'dieback' complexes, which may also include additional environmental factors. It is not clear which specific problem is reported here. While disease management for most citrus pathogens includes clean planting stock and elimination of pathogen reservoirs, conclusive diagnosis of the pathogen(s) involved is needed to design effective management strategies.

It is thought that combinations of various pathogens may have contributed to the general decline of citrus health in the region due to accumulation of parasitic pathogens in old orchards over time. Extensive harvest failures have led to citrus replanting programmes (ProMED-mail post 20080130.0375), but these will only be of long term benefit if linked to an ongoing crop sanitation and monitoring programme to prevent re-introduction of pathogens, especially into orchards used as sources for propagating material.
