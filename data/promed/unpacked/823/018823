A suspected case of bubonic plague in western Mongolia's Khovd (or Hovd) province has been confirmed by lab test results, the country's National Center for Zoonotic Diseases (NCZD) said on Sun 27 Sep 2020.

The 25-year-old female patient from the province and 19 people in close contact with her are now under isolation at a local hospital, the NCZD said in a statement. The center said the woman was found to have eaten marmot meat last week. While hunting marmots is illegal in Mongolia, many Mongolians regard the rodent as a delicacy and ignore the law.

Since the beginning of 2020, the Asian country has reported 22 suspected cases, 6 of which were confirmed by laboratory tests. Three of the 6 patients have died. 17 out of all the 21 Mongolian provinces are now at risk of the bubonic plague, the NCZD said, urging the public to avoid eating marmot meat.

The bubonic plague is a bacterial disease spread by fleas living on wild rodents such as marmots and can kill an adult in less than 24 hours if not treated in time, according to the WHO.

[Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_. Plague appears to be more prevalent this year (2020) in Mongolia. It is not clear that person-to-person spread has occurred.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated or sometimes without having a preceding bubo, plague bacteria can invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. A quarantine would be required with contact tracing and even prophylactic antimicrobials if the index case or cases actually had plague pneumonia.

Plague is endemic in Mongolia. Marmots such as the Tarvaga, the Tarbagan or Mongolian marmot, _Marmota sibirica_, a large rodent related to the American woodchuck (_M. monax_), are thought to be significant zoonotic reservoirs for _Y. pestis_ in Eastern Asia. The name marmot comes from French marmotte, from Latin _mures monti_ "mountain mouse".

While foodborne transmission of _Y. pestis_ has been described (such as Leslie T, et al. Outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by _Yersinia pestis_ in Afghanistan. Epidemiol Infect. 2011; 139(5): 728-35; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20663260), it is far more likely that the bubonic plague cases were acquired via the bites of infected fleas. - Mod.LL
