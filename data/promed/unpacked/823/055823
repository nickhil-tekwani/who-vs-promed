Avian influenza situation in Cambodia
-------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Cambodia has announced a new confirmed case of
human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.

A 57 year old man, from Ponhea Kreak District, Kampong Cham Province,
developed symptoms on 11 Dec 2009. The case was admitted to Kampong Cham
Provincial Hospital on 16 Dec 2009, where he received treatment. He is in a
stable condition. The presence of the H5N1 virus was confirmed by the
National Influenza Centre, the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge. A team led by
the Ministry of Health is conducting field investigations into the source
of his infection.

Of the 9 cases confirmed to date in Cambodia, 7 have been fatal. This is
the 1st diagnosed case in Cambodia during 2009. [However a case of
inapparent human H5N1 virus infection was recorded in the month of march in
2009; see the ProMED-mail archived report Avian influenza, human (93):
Cambodia, inapparent infection 20090522.1915. - Mod.CP]

[Overall there have been few human cases of avian influenza (H5N1) virus
infection in Cambodia: 4 in 2005, 2 in 2006, one in 2007, and one in 2008.
All unfortunately fatal except the 2008 case. This recurrence in 2009 is
regrettable.
