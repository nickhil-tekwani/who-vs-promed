The almost incessant rain over the past 60 days and nights threatens
to ruin large parts of the French wine harvest this year [2007],
especially in Bordeaux. Some small vineyards have already lost their
entire crop to a form of mildew, a fungal parasite, which thrives in
damp and warm conditions.
Other forms of mildew, including the dreaded potato blight, are
threatening to destroy other crops in France, ranging from tomatoes
to cherries.
"It is many years since we have seen conditions like this, with
warmth and humidity at the same time," said Olivier Rostang, a
winemaking consultant in the Rhone valley. "The mildew is biting
hard, attacking the leaves of the vines, and worse, in some cases,
the grapes. We are fighting for the 2007 vintage."
Didier Michaud, a small wine producer in Medoc, north of Bordeaux,
said: "I will have no wine this year [2007]. The mildew has attacked
all my vines. There is just one small patch where the grapes have not
yet fallen off."
Bordeaux, where the rain has hardly paused since early May [2007], is
the worst afflicted region. Problems have also been reported in
Champagne, Beaujolais, the Loire, and the Rhone valley.
This is a calamity for the worst hit growers but not necessarily for
the French wine industry. A much-reduced 2007 wine harvest might help
to push up wholesale wine prices, which have been depressed by a glut
of cheap wine on the world market. Huge unsold stocks of table wine,
and even the cheaper Appellation Controlee wines, remain from 2006
and 2005. As for the quality of the 2007 vintage, all is still
uncertain. A warm and dry late summer could still produce excellent
wines.
[Downy] vine mildew or _Plasmopara viticola_ is a fungus borne on the
wind in damp conditions. It produces brown blotches on the leaves
before spreading to, and rotting, the young grapes. There are
preventative remedies and controls, but they are frowned upon by the
more militant, organic food watchdogs. Organic wine producers --
increasingly common in France -- have therefore been the worst hit.
The problems have been made worse by the fact that the ground has
become so damp that it is impossible, or ill-advised, to drive heavy
machinery into the vineyards. Spraying with anti-mildew products,
such as "Bordeaux mixture" (copper sulphate and lime) has had to be
carried out by hand. The rain has often washed the protective coating
away again.

The 2007 vintages in Bordeaux and several other regions are
threatened with disaster as grapevines are hit by a plague of mildew
brought on by unseasonable weather conditions in France, wine
officials warned yesterday [10 Jul 2007].
The harvest of vineyards from Bordeaux, Burgundy, Beaujolais,
Champagne, and the Loire have already been wiped out by the fungus,
which is thriving due to unusually high rainfall and warm
temperatures. Only Provence and the southwestern Languedoc-Roussillon
region have been spared. In many cases, the harvest can only now be
saved by consistently warm and dry conditions until September [2007].
Powdery mildew 1st attacks the vine leaves, which turn brown and
wilt, before moving onto the grapes, which split and fall to the
ground. It can also produce unpleasant flavours in wine made from
infected grapes. The disease spreads fast between grapes that have
swollen in humid conditions.
Organic wine growers have suffered the most. "I will have no harvest,
nothing this year [2007]. Everything has been attacked by the
mildew," Didier Michaud, an organic wine producer, told the newspaper
Liberation. His 1.7 hectares (4.2 acres) of vines have been severely
damaged. "I still have one tiny plot but I'm under no illusions," he
said.
His neighbour has already lost 15 hectares (37 acres). Insurance does
not cover mildew attacks. Last year [2006], the fungus was killed off
by a run of warm weather. "This year [2007], the rains are regular
and uninterrupted, so there is no time for the grapes to dry," said
Eric Maille, an agronomist from the Gironde area.
In several regions, organic growers are exceptionally resorting to
spraying anti-fungal chemicals on their vines to ward off the disease.

[Both mildews may be present in the affected areas, however, there
may also still be uncertainty about which one is doing the damage.
The source of diagnostic identification of the fungi is not reported
and its level of reliability is unclear.
Downy mildew
------------
The fungus _Plasmopara viticola_ causes downy mildew of grapevine. It
causes lesions on leaves, which later become necrotic. During years
with warm, extended wet periods during bloom, fruit clusters may be
partially or totally destroyed.
Powdery mildew
--------------
Powdery mildew of grapevine is caused by the fungus _Erysiphe
necator_. Leaves heavily infected by powdery mildew have reduced
photosynthetic ability resulting in decreased plant vigour and
increased chance of winter injury to the vines.
Mildew spores are spread to the leaves and berries mainly by
splashing rain, wind, or mechanical means. The fungi overwinter in
infected leaves on the ground. Mildew diseases on grapevine can be
extremely serious and will cause severe crop loss. They can be
controlled with fungicides; however, the weather conditions described
above have probably made fungicide application difficult.
Downy and powdery mildews are 2 groups of fungi with each group
causing similar symptoms on a range of host plants. Each group
includes many species in a number of genera. Generally, each fungal
species is confined to a number of host species it affects. Mildews
cause serious losses in many important crops including cereals, hops,
sunflower, and a number of vegetable crops.
