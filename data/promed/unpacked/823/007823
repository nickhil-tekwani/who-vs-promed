Ivan Pustovit, head of veterinary medicine in the Odessa region,
cannot understand the reason for the occurrence of anthrax in pigs in
the Berezovskiy district of the Odessa region in the Ukraine. He
reported it on Fri 2 Jun 2006, noting the deaths of 2 pigs (sows) on
the Bogdan Khmelnitskiy private farm, and said that the reason the
outbreak of anthrax was puzzling was because the animals had been
kept in an enclosed space indoors on a farm. Probably, the disease
was brought onto the farm with food or instruments used for the
animals' care.
As he noted, this is not the 1st case of anthrax this year [2006]. A
similar case was registered in the spring in the Ivanovo district of
the same region. The head of the department also noted that, except
for 2 dead pigs, similar clinical symptoms have been noted at the
same farm in 8 pigs as well. However, all sick animals have been
cured.
At this moment, the animals are undergoing treatment. Pustovit added
that the carcasses of the 2 dead animals have been utilized [sic!],
and disinfection of pens has been carried out. Quarantine has been
established on the farm, and the cattle are under the constant
control of experts.

[As the animals were penned, it would be logical to expect that
contaminated pig feed was the cause. Multi-site outbreaks (see
following reports) can only strengthen such speculation. Of course,
proof depends upon the local epidemiologic expertise available and
willingness to deal with the results and political fallout. What is
meant by "utilizing" the 2 pig carcasses is open to speculation;
hopefully, they have been sequestered and burnt. Fortunately, pigs
are moderately resistant to this disease. - Mod.MHJ]

The focus of anthrax has been found in the village of Kreminna in the
Khmelnitskiy region of Ukraine. The Central Administrative Board of
the Ministry of Emergency Measures of the Khmelnitskiy area has
reported that, during a pre-sale check at the Khmelnitsk market,
_Bacillus anthracis_ was found. The diagnosis has been laboratory
confirmed. How the animals became infected is unknown at this time.
Six persons were exposed from contact with the infected meat. All
these people now are under medical supervision and taking
preventative treatment. Experts of the sanitary epidemiological
station and veterinary services are carrying out anti-epidemic and
anti-epizootic measures in the village.

The Epizootic Branch of the State Department of Veterinary Medicine
in the Ministry of Agrarian Policy has declared that the epizootic
situation in the Ukraine is stable and is under veterinary control.
The OIE has recognized the Ukraine as one of the safe countries in
the field of veterinary medicine. All pets have been vaccinated,
cases of anthrax are rare and similar extraordinary incidents of
anthrax are considered to be a "break of immunity in animals."
Contamination of cattle with the most dangerous diseases, e.g., foot
and mouth disease and CJD, have not been registered during the last 4
years.

[...so we can all sleep soundly. On the other hand, from 2000 through
2004, there were 26 bovine anthrax outbreaks in the Ukraine with some
141 animals affected, 3 sheep/goat outbreaks reported (in these
species, un-reporting is the norm) with 13 deaths, 2 equine outbreaks
with 7 deaths, and 5 pig outbreaks and only 5 deaths reported. The
give-away is that in the same period, there have been 15 human cases
reported. If the disease is under proper control, there should be
zero human cases. Though the disease is "sporadic" in the Ukraine, it
is equally obvious that the control and vaccination programs are
patently inadequate, whatever the official ministerial statements. -
