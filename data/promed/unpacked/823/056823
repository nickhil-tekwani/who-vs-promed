[3] Care-provider shortage
Date: Wed 31 Aug 2016
Source: USA Today [edited]
http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/08/31/medical-specialists-needed-care-zika-babies-short-supply/89612822/


Babies born with Zika virus-related birth defects, such as severe brain damage and trouble seeing, hearing and walking, may find their troubles compounded by a shortage of doctors trained to treat them.

"These children are going to need an incredible amount of care," said Ann Tilton, a child neurologist in New Orleans and fellow of the American Academy of Neurology.

Yet neurologists like Tilton who are trained to diagnose and manage the care of babies with brain damage are in short supply, especially in rural areas. A 2013 study from the American Academy of Neurology, conducted long before the Zika outbreak made news, found that the U.S. needs about 11 percent more neurologists than it currently has.

Zika is best known for causing microcephaly, in which babies are born with abnormally small heads and incomplete brain development. But congenital Zika virus syndrome, as the condition has become known, can include a variety of devastating problems, including seizures and joint deformities that prevent them from fully using their arms and legs. They'll need the care of a host of medical specialists, as well as intensive, hands-on care from physical therapists, occupational therapists and others.

Often such specialists are concentrated in large cities and are already overloaded with more patients than they can handle.

[4] Hearing loss in infants

Leal MC, Muniz LF, Ferreira TS, et al. Hearing Loss in Infants with Microcephaly and Evidence of Congenital Zika Virus Infection -- Brazil, November 2015-May 2016.

[Background]
A single study in Brazil investigated auditory function among 23 neonates with microcephaly and presumed congenital Zika virus infection, using otoacoustic emissions testing without a confirmatory examination, and found 9 percent with auditory deficits. In all of the studies described, Zika virus infection was a diagnosis of exclusion because, at the time, specific testing for Zika virus was not readily available.

[Methods]
During November 2015-May 2016, as part of the protocol for evaluation of children who were born with microcephaly during the Zika virus disease epidemic, 150 children were referred to Hospital Agamenon Magalhães, a reference center for diagnosis of hearing loss and hearing rehabilitation in Pernambuco, Brazil; the 23 children previously evaluated in Pernambuco were not part of this cohort. This report is a retrospective analysis of hearing assessments in 70 infants aged 0-10 months with microcephaly and laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection evaluated during that time. Zika virus-associated microcephaly was defined as head circumference 32 cm or less for term newborns (gestational age at birth 37 weeks to 41 weeks and 6 days), or at least 2 standard deviations below the mean for gestational age and sex using the Fenton curve for preterm newborns, with the characteristic radiologic findings from cranial computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, and laboratory confirmation of Zika virus by a positive Zika virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) performed on cerebrospinal fluid. Other infectious causes of congenital sensorineural hearing loss, including CMV, toxoplasmosis, herpes simplex, and syphilis, were excluded by serologic testing of infants and their mothers. Information was collected concerning the presence and timing of rash during pregnancy and on maternal or perinatal risk factors for congenital hearing loss, such as alcohol consumption, familial hearing loss, ototoxic drug exposure, birth trauma, and postnatal infections. The degree of microcephaly was evaluated, with severe microcephaly defined as head circumference at birth of at least 3 standard deviations below the mean for gestational age and sex.

Auditory evaluation was carried out by screening and diagnostic tests as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics' Joint Committee on Infant Hearing. The screening test consisted of measurement of the short latency auditory brainstem response (ABR) to click stimuli, and was considered to be normal when wave V (the 5th and most prominent and consistent wave) was identified in 2 consecutive averaged waveforms at 35 decibels normal hearing level (dB nHL). If the 1st screening test was not normal, it was repeated approximately 1 month later. If the 2nd test also indicated hearing loss, a diagnostic confirmatory frequency-specific ABR was conducted, in which the stimuli were tone bursts at frequencies of 500 and 2000 Hz. The diagnosis of hearing loss was confirmed if hearing thresholds exceeded 25 dB nHL. No behavioral auditory testing was performed. Conductive hearing loss was not considered to be related to Zika virus infection because the hearing impairment caused by congenital viral infections is sensorineural. All children considered normal on hearing evaluation will be regularly assessed for evidence of late-onset hearing impairment. Associations between sensorineural hearing loss and presence of maternal rash during pregnancy, timing of maternal rash during pregnancy, and severe microcephaly were analyzed using contingency tables and tested using Fisher's exact test, with statistical significance defined as p under 0.05. Although all investigations were carried out as part of routine clinical care, and human subjects review was not required, the protocol was submitted for ethical review and approved by Hospital Agamenon Magalhães.

Discussion
In this report of complete auditory function evaluation in a series of 70 children with microcephaly and laboratory evidence of congenital Zika virus infection, 5 (7.1 percent) infants had sensorineural hearing loss. The hearing loss varied in severity and laterality, which has been reported in hearing loss associated with other congenital infections. If the one infant with bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss who had been treated with amikacin (a known ototoxic antibiotic) before the hearing testing is excluded, the proportion of infants with sensorineural hearing loss was 5.8 percent (4 of 69). This proportion, although lower than the 9 percent reported from a small sample of newborns with microcephaly associated with presumed Zika-virus infection tested by otoacoustic emissions, is within the range (6-65 percent) reported for other congenital viral infections. In the majority of cases of hearing loss associated with congenital viral infection, the damage to the auditory system is within the cochlea. It is likely that similar lesions account for the hearing deficit in children with congenital Zika virus infection, although histologic studies are needed to confirm this. However, a concomitant central origin cannot be discounted, and behavioral auditory evaluation might provide additional information.

The prevalence of progressive hearing loss associated with congenital Zika virus infection is not known. To elucidate the full spectrum of hearing loss in infants with congenital Zika virus infection, testing and follow-up of all children born to women who had Zika virus infection during pregnancy, including infants with no apparent anomalies at birth, is needed. Sensorineural hearing loss should be considered part of the spectrum of clinical findings associated with congenital Zika virus infection, and congenital Zika virus infection should be considered a risk factor for hearing loss in auditory screening programs. Children with evidence of congenital Zika virus infection who have normal initial screening tests should receive regular follow-up, because onset of hearing loss could be delayed and the loss could be progressive.

Saravanan Thangamani, Jing Huang, Charles E. Hart, Hilda Guzman and Robert B. Tesh. Vertical Transmission of Zika Virus in _Aedes aegypti_ Mosquitoes

Abstract
Previous experimental studies have demonstrated that a number of mosquito-borne flavivirus pathogens are vertically transmitted in their insect vectors, providing a mechanism for these arboviruses to persist during adverse climatic conditions or in the absence of a susceptible vertebrate host. In this study, designed to test whether Zika virus (ZIKV) could be vertically transmitted, female _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ were injected with ZIKV, and their F1 adult progeny were tested for ZIKV infection. Of 69 _Ae. aegypti_ pools, 6 consisted of a total of 1738 F1 adults, yielded ZIKV upon culture, giving a minimum filial infection rate of 1:290. In contrast, none of 803 F1 _Ae. albopictus_ adults (32 pools) yielded ZIKV. The MFIR for Ae. aegypti was comparable to MFIRs reported for other flaviviruses in mosquitoes, including dengue, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, West Nile, and St. Louis encephalitis viruses. The results suggest that vertical transmission may provide a potential mechanism for the virus to survive during adverse conditions.

[The results of this finding have significant implications for the persistence of Zika virus in areas where it is transmitted. Eradication and control of _Aedes aegypti_ is very difficult. Vertical transmission provides a good mechanism for virus persistence in populations of the mosquito vector, and indicates that the virus is likely to persist and become endemic in large areas of the Americas, and perhaps explains, in part, how Zika virus persists endemically in Southeast Asia. - Mod.TY]

Inovio Pharmaceuticals has initiated a clinical study of its preventive Zika vaccine (GLS-5700) in 160 subjects in Puerto Rico, where the Zika virus outbreak has been declared a public health emergency.

Inovio is developing its Zika vaccine, GLS-5700, with GeneOne Life Science and academic collaborators from the U.S. and Canada.

In June 2016, Inovio was the 1st to commence a human Zika [vaccine] trial, with sites in the U.S. and Canada. All 40 subjects for the 1st clinical study have been fully enrolled and dosed. Inovio expects to report results before the end of this year [2016].

There are no approved vaccines or therapies for Zika virus infection. While multiple companies and academic groups have announced development plans for Zika virus vaccines, only Inovio and a US government research center have started human clinical studies.

Identification of small-molecule inhibitors of Zika virus infection and induced neural cell death via a drug repurposing screen.

Abstract
In response to the current global health emergency posed by the Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak and its link to microcephaly and other neurological conditions, we performed a drug repurposing screen of ca. 6000 compounds that included approved drugs, clinical trial drug candidates and pharmacologically active compounds; we identified compounds that either inhibit ZIKV infection or suppress infection-induced caspase-3 activity in different neural cells. A pan-caspase inhibitor, emricasan, inhibited ZIKV-induced increases in caspase-3 activity and protected human cortical neural progenitors in both monolayer and 3-dimensional organoid cultures. 10 structurally unrelated inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases inhibited ZIKV replication. Niclosamide, a category B anthelmintic drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, also inhibited ZIKV replication. Finally, combination treatments using one compound from each category (neuroprotective and antiviral) further increased protection of human neural progenitors and astrocytes from ZIKV-induced cell death. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy and identify lead compounds for anti-ZIKV drug development.

The US Food and Drug Administration has granted Emergency Use Authorization to a Zika test from Roche that runs on the firm's LightCycler 480 Instrument II or Cobas z 480 Analyzer.

The LightMix Zika real-time RT-PCR Test is an easy-to-use molecular diagnostic test that enables healthcare professionals to quickly detect viral RNA in plasma or serum of patients meeting US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clinical or epidemiological criteria, Roche said in a statement.

The automated testing process, from sample preparation to results for up to 96 samples, can be performed in just 2.5 hours, the firm said.

"The FDA's granting of this EUA supports our commitment to help healthcare professionals who are working to combat this serious disease," said Uwe Oberlaender, Roche's head of molecular diagnostics.

Roche previously received authorization under an Investigational New Drug protocol for use of its Cobas 6800/8800 Zika assay for blood screening, specifically in labs enrolled in a clinical trial through the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Last week, the FDA recommended universal testing of donated whole blood and blood components.
