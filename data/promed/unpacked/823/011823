Seed-borne fungal disease bakanae has hit large areas of paddy crop in Karnal [district]. Farmers fear it may affect the productivity and reduce the yield. "The fungal disease has attacked my basmati crop, although I used fungicide," said a farmer, adding that he had approached the authorities for its remedy. [Another] progressive farmer said the same adding that it had affected around 4 acres [1.6 ha] of 1509 variety of the crop. He said it might lead to a huge loss.

An expert said, "It affects varieties of basmati, including 1509." [The Department of] Agriculture said, "It happens when the paddy nursery is planted after removing it from dry land." Farmers [should] inform the department, so that they could detect the fungal disease. [They] should not use any fungicide without the recommendation of the department.

[Fungal foot rot (also called bakanae disease) of rice is reported from rice growing countries worldwide, except for Australia. It is caused by _Fusarium fujikuroi_ which is now considered a species complex that can also affect other crops, including maize (_Zea mays_; kernel rot), sorghum (_Sorghum_ spp.) and sugar cane (_Saccharum_ species and hybrids; pokkah boeng, see ProMED-mail post 20200717.7582937).

Bakanae can cause significant crop losses of up to 50 percent in rice and is emerging as a major problem in Asia. Symptoms on rice may include abnormal growth patterns (such as highly elongated tillers), reduced tillering, and partially filled or empty seed heads. Diseased plants show yellow-green discolouration; their leaves dry up quickly and they may be distributed irregularly in a field. Infected seedlings with necrotic lesions on roots may die before or after transplanting from seed beds.

Plants get infected through roots or crowns, the infection later becomes systemic. Seeds are usually infected during the flowering stage and the disease is primarily seed borne. The fungi survive under adverse conditions in infected seeds and diseased plant parts. Disease management is difficult and may include use of certified clean seeds, fungicides (such as seed treatments or root dips), phytosanitation, and use of crop cultivars with reduced pathogen sensitivity. Rapid development of new pathogen strains with fungicide resistances or able to break genetic host resistance has been observed.

Traditional rice cultivars previously grown across northern India have largely been replaced by basmati (aromatic long grain) varieties. Some basmatis have shown a higher sensitivity to certain pathogens, for example to rice blast (_Pyricularia oryzae_; ProMED-mail post 20160407.4145967).

A different foot rot disease of rice can be caused by several species of bacteria in the genus _Dickeya_ (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).
