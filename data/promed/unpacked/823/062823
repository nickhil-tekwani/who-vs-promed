A review of antibiotic use will be carried out after a [vancomycin-
resistant _Enterococcus_ sp. (VRE) was found in 2 kidney
patients who died at Tuen Mun Hospital, the secretary for Health and
Welfare of Hong Kong Dr. Yeoh Eng-kiong said yesterday. Dr. Yeoh
said the Hospital Authority would determine whether the antibiotic
vancomycin had been used properly.
He was speaking a day after it was revealed that 2 kidney dialysis patients
died and another was admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital after being found to be
carriers of VRE. The patients were believed to have shared a ward, reports
the South China Morning Post.
About 300 end-stage kidney failure patients who are on continuous
ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or CAPD, are being traced and examined for
the presence of the [VRE.
Dr. George Chan of the Kidney Patients Trust Fund said patients on CAPD
were prone to peritonitis, which requires treatment with antibiotics. The
emergence of VRE was not unexpected, Dr. Chan said but he believed no CAPD
patients had become infected outside hospital.
Meanwhile, Dr. Dominic Tsang Ngai-chong, spokesman for the College of
Pathologists, urged a "more stringent and vigilant approach" to stop the
spread of VRE, including the isolation of carriers and use of gloves and gowns.
On the other hand, the chairman of the infectious diseases division of the
University of Hong Kong Professor Yuen Kwok-yung said there might be "room
for improvement" in antibiotics use at Tuen Mun Hospital. He added: "Even
if your immune system is normal and you are undergoing an operation in the
hospital, if the hospital is VRE endemic, you have a chance of being infected."

[It has been known since 1997 (or earlier) that routine use of vancomycin
for prophylaxis in ambulatory dialysis patients could select for
vancomycin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci (see ProMED-mail
references cited above). It would be of interest to hear some current
views of best practices with respect to the use of vancomycin to treat
dialysis patients. - Mod.ES
