West Virginia: 2 Cases of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome, One Fatal
---------------------------------------------------
I have no other information, but I saw in our local news WDTV last night
that West Virginia has a confirmed case of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome. A male patient is being treated at Ruby Memorial Hospital or WVU
Hospital in Morgantown, WV. They also reported that a Virginia man died on
Fri 16 Jul 2004 [8 Jul 2004 according to the following report - Mod.CP]
from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome believed to have been contracted while
he was doing research in West Virginia.
According to the CDC website, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome was first found
in West Virginia in June of 1993, at the same time as it was found in the
Southwest, US. These 2 cases will be the 2nd and 3rd confirmed cases in
West Virginia.

Virginia: Fatal Case of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome Contracted in WV
--------------------------------------------------
State and federal health officials confirmed on Fri 16 Jul 2004 that a
Virginia Tech graduate student died last week of a rare exposure to
hantavirus, which causes severe pneumonia and sudden respiratory problems.
The victim, a 32-year-old master's degree student in Tech's Department of
Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences, is only the 2nd case of hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in Virginia. The other case, in 1993, involved a
through-hiker on the Appalachian Trail who survived the disease.
HPS, which is not contagious from human to human, is caused by exposure to
hantavirus-contaminated rodent feces, urine or saliva. There have been 318
known HPS cases in the United States in recorded history through 2002 with
a mortality rate of 37 percent, according to information from the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Although an investigation is still under way, health officials believe the
student most likely came into contact with hantavirus while researching
small-mammal communities in a private forest in Randolph County, West
Virginia. Concern in that community was heightened on Friday when it was
announced that a 2nd man known to frequent a cabin in Randolph County was
hospitalized in Morgantown with HPS. West Virginia health officials said
there is no evidence that the 2 cases are linked. CDC agents will assist in
the investigation. "They are actually in 2 distinct locations, separate
from one another but both in Randolph County," said Dr. Jane Rooney, a
public health veterinarian with the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health
Surveillance and Disease Control.
New River Valley health officials said there are no signs of a hantavirus
outbreak in Virginia. "This is a very rare occurrence, and this is not
communicable from person to person," said Katherine McCombs, epidemiologist
with the New River Health District. "But we would also like to stress that
if anybody is in a situation where they are close to rodents, especially if
they are cleaning up rodent feces or what they think might be feces, they
need to take precautions." Those precautions include wetting the area with
a bleach solution and avoiding stirring particles into the air by sweeping.
The student died at Montgomery Regional Hospital on 8 Jul 2004 as a result
of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress. Since enrolling in Virginia
Tech's College of Natural Resources in 2002, the student was known as a
hard worker and eager teacher who loved working in the field. His latest
project involved examining the impact of logging on communities of small
mammals -- including mice -- at the Mead Westvaco Wildlife and Ecosystem
Research Forest in Randolph County. He was expected to complete his
research this winter.
Eric Hallerman, an associate professor in the Department of Fisheries and
Wildlife Sciences, said the department is compiling a list of everywhere
the student worked during the previous 35 days as well as everyone with
whom he worked and the animal species he may have handled. Those who worked
with the student are being urged to watch closely for possible HPS
symptoms. All students who enter the department are instructed in the
safety precautions that must be taken while handling wild animals,
Hallerman said.

is awaited on the proximity of the locations of exposure, the probable
rodent species involved, and the relationship (or not) of the hantaviruses
responsible for these infections. - Mod.CP]
