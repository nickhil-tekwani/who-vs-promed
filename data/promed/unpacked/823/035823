Department of Health Medical Entomologist Sue Harrington said that
the mosquito and virus surveillance program (undertaken by The
University of Western Australia) had detected Kunjin virus in the
Kimberley in recent weeks, and preliminary data indicated that the
virus was also now active in the Pilbara region.

"Recent heavy rainfall has resulted in large areas of standing water
and the potential for mosquito breeding in many areas of the
Kimberley, Pilbara, Gascoyne and Murchison regions. Surveillance
results show that mosquitoes are carrying Kunjin virus, with activity
of Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus, also likely during the wet
season months," Ms Harrington said. A number of cases of the more
common Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus diseases have already
been reported from the Kimberley and Pilbara regions this wet season.

"The risk of being infected and becoming unwell is low, but
mosquito-borne illnesses can be debilitating and people should take
sensible precautions to avoid mosquito bites," she said. "Infection
with Kunjin virus can cause symptoms that are similar to Ross River
virus disease, such as swollen and aching joints, fever and rash.
However in rare cases, Kunjin can cause more severe symptoms which
include headache, neck stiffness, fever, delirium and coma."

Initial symptoms of MVE include fever, drowsiness, headache, stiff
neck, nausea and dizziness and people experiencing these symptoms
should seek medical advice quickly. In severe cases, people may
experience fits, lapse into a coma, and could be left with permanent
brain damage or die.

"There are no specific cures or vaccines for these mosquito-borne
diseases so it is very important that people take care to prevent
being bitten by mosquitoes." Ms Harrington said controlling mosquitoes
in most rural regions of WA was generally not possible because of the
large size and inaccessibility of natural mosquito breeding habitat.

[The unusual amount of precipitation has increased mosquito vector
populations and virus circulation across wide areas of Australia. This
has been anticipated by Australian health authorities, and the results
of ongoing vector surveillance and sentinel chicken efforts are
providing early warnings with appropriate recommendations for avoiding
mosquito bites.

As Mod.CP pointed out in his comment of 17 Apr 2010 (ProMED-mail
archive number 20100417.1251): In the 8th ICTV Report Kunjin virus and
West Nile virus are grouped together (as members of the West Nile
virus species), whereas Murray Valley encephalitis virus is considered
to be close to Alfuy virus (together forming the Murray Valley
encephalitis virus species). Both species are members of the Japanese
encephalitis virus group of flaviviruses.
