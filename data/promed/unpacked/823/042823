Mongolia's Emergency Situations Agency announced on 7 Jan 2008 that
since equine influenza appeared in October 2007 in the country's
western provinces of Khovd and Bayan-Olgii, the disease has gradually
spread, affecting a total of over 60 000 horses in 11 provinces in
Mongolia.
This outbreak of equine influenza has led to 21 horse deaths.
Mongolia's government has taken measures including isolation,
disinfection, vaccination etc.
Up to now, over 30 000 horses have been cured.
Mongolia is a major livestock raising country with over 2 million
horses. The last outbreak of equine influenza in Mongolia occurred in
1992 in Khovd, when 13 000 horses were infected.
Equine influenza is a highly-transmissible respiratory tract illness
that can cause weakness and even death in horses but cannot be
transmitted to people.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Dan Silver
[Mongolia's "immediate notification" to the OIE of 14 Nov 2007
reported that since the start of the outbreak on 26 Oct 2007, there
had been 7 outbreaks (4 in Bayan-Ulgii, 3 in Khovd), including a
total of 11 631 cases out of 101 587 susceptible horses, with 9
mortalities (see 20071117.372). The apparent addition of some 50 000
cases during the subsequent 7-8 weeks may be indicative of the steady
rate of the virus's spread. The epizootic is expected to subside
following the advanced performance of mass vaccinations.
On 5 Nov 2007, China officially notified the OIE of a massive outbreak
[of this disease] in its northern province Xinjiang, bordering western
Mongolia, which had started on 9 Oct 2007. A total of 7 counties were
affected ? see ProMED ref. below.
