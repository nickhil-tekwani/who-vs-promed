An anthrax scare has gripped people residing in Similipal biosphere following the death of 8 cattle and over 100 pigs in the last week. Carcasses of the livestock were first spotted in Balama village on Sunday last [29 Mar 2015]. Subsequently, more carcasses were spotted in nearby villages, leaving the villagers panicked.

The biosphere authorities have asked forest officials to intensify patrolling within the sanctuary limits and also keep an eye on wild animals. Villagers have been asked not to enter the forest.

Divisional Forest Officer Sanjay Swain said a team of veterinary doctors and forest officials from Udala forest range visited the village on Saturday [4 Apr 2015] and collected blood and viscera samples from the carcass of a calf. "We initially suspected that the livestock died of pneumonia, but a blood and viscera report will only confirm if the deaths were due to anthrax or pneumonia," he said.

In December 2014, an elephant died of anthrax in Subarnamanjari forest in the Dukura range. [See: 20141218.3042025] The viscera test conducted by Animal Diseases Research Institute (ADRI) at Cuttack had confirmed the presence of the organism that causes anthrax - _Bacillus anthracis_ -- in the jumbo. Following this incident, the livestock in and around the forest range were vaccinated 3 months back. Once vaccinated, the animals cannot be given another dose for six months.

[It is a fact of life that villagers near a national park will graze their livestock, whatever the regulations inside said park boundaries, and whatever is in the latter will be transferred to the former. And pigs will scavenge on dead carcasses and on tossed viscera from butchered animals. At this point anthrax is merely suspected. If the livestock were vaccinated in December 2014 they should still be covered. But the ages of the affected animals is not given, other than the fact that a calf was sampled. Calves are rarely vaccinated. And unless the pigs were suspected to have been at risk, vaccination was probably limited to cattle. There is no reason why the villagers' livestock should not be revaccinated if the calf comes up positive for _B. anthracis_. The quoted 6-month delay is more bureaucratic than veterinary.

A map of India can be seen at http://www.mapsofindia.com/images2/india-map.jpg. Similipal Sanctuary is in northern Odisha and is a national park and a tiger reserve situated in the Mayurbhanj district, in the Indian state of Odisha. It is part of the Similipal-Kuldiha-Hadgarh Elephant Reserve popularly known as Mayurbhanj Elephant Reserve, which includes 3 protected areas, that is, Similipal Tiger Reserve (2750 sq km/1062 sq mi), Hadgarh Wildlife sanctuary (191.06 sq km/73.77 sq mi), and Kuldiha wildlife sanctuary (272.75 sq km/105.31 sq mi). Similipal National Park derives its name from the abundance of Semul or red silk cotton trees that bloom abundantly in the locality.

The park has a protected area of 845.70 sq km (326.53 sq mi) and has some beautiful waterfalls like Joranda and Barehipani. Similipal is home to 99 Royal Bengal Tigers and 432 wild elephants. Similipal is also famous for gaurs (Indian bison), chausingha (4-horned antelope), as well as an orchidarium (orchid garden). (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simlipal_National_Park.
