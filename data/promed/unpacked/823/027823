In the summer of 2018, leptospirosis disease broke out in cattle herds grazing in the southern Golan Heights. At the same time, the disease also affected people who bathed in the streams of the southern Golan and in the Jordan River.

The Ministry of Health reported 500 human cases during 2018, compared to 10 in 2017. Clinical cases and mortality, confirmed by positive serology for leptospirosis, were reported in dogs, which entered the streams in the said area.

Serological tests in animals and humans were indicative of _Leptospira pomona_ being the most likely pathogen. This serovar is adapted to pigs, in which disease signs are mild while bacterial secretion in urine is high and protracted.

Among wild boars hunted on the Golan Heights, the sero-positivity rate was high, exceeding 30%.

During the autumn of 2018, aborting cows in several beef cattle herds on pasture on the northern Golan and Upper Galilee were tested and found seropositive to leptospirosis. The positive-reacting herds were treated with appropriate antibiotics and the owners instructed to vaccinate their cattle.

In February 2019, the owners of cattle herds pasturing in the Masada Wood and along the streams draining into the Jordan River and the Lake Kinneret [Lake of Tiberias] were instructed to vaccinate their animals against leptospirosis as a compulsory vaccination.

On 17 Mar 2019, a decision was taken by the government regarding the treatment of watercourses pollution. The decision also includes allocation of up to NIS 0.75 million [USD 210 000] by the Ministry of Agriculture in favor of vaccination activity against leptospirosis.

This procedure is intended to regulate the support in the funding of the vaccination costs for the owners of herds on pasture in the relevant area.

The stipulation of the areas involved and, consequently, support being given, is based upon professional criteria. The budget allocated to support the vaccination of beef cattle in the area is up to 750 000 NIS [USD 210 000]. Support will be given for vaccinations performed from 14 Mar to 31 Aug 2019.

Any of the following vaccines may be used:
Lepto shield 5 - Elanco
Spirovac L5 - Zoeits
Lepto-5 - Colorado serum

[When the severity and dimensions of the leptospirosis waterborne epidemic on the Golan Heights became apparent in the summer of 2018, the Public Health Services of the Israeli Ministry of Health (MOH) initiated the formation of a multi-disciplinary outbreak control team. The team included 18 members, representing the following 14 institutions:

1 - Ministry of Health Directorate, Jerusalem
2 - The Division of Epidemiology, Public Health Services, Ministry of Health, Jerusalem
3 - School of Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva
4 - Public Health Services, Ministry of Health, Jerusalem
5 - Braun School of Public Health and Community Medicine, Hebrew University and Hadassah, Jerusalem
6 - Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona
7 - Northern District, Ministry of Health
8 - Public Health Branch, IDF Medical Corps
9 - Nature and Parks Authority, Jerusalem
10 - Mekorot Central Laboratory, Eshkol Site, National Water Company
11 - Israeli Veterinary Services, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Beit Dagan
12 - Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem
13 - Jerusalem District, Clalit Health Services, Jerusalem
14 - Public Health Laboratory, Haifa District, Ministry of Health, Haifa.

The team published its initial report on 22 Sep 2018 (Ref 1) and, most probably, has been continuing its activity since, as apparent from the availability of data, which eventually led the government to decide funding of the cattle vaccinations in the affected area.

Since late 2010, vaccination against leptospirosis in cattle, traditionally performed by the State Veterinary Service, was privatized in Israel. As a result, no vaccination records have become publicly available since. Leptospirosis is reportable in Israel in animal and humans; unfortunately, it has been deleted from OIE's list, thus outbreaks and vaccination records are not required to be reported by member countries anymore.

Unofficially, we are informed that the vaccination coverage on the Golan in 2018 was lower than expected, probably due to the costs. This, hopefully, is to be remedied by the funding. In addition: vaccination may fail to reduce bacterial excretion in already-infected animals.

The Leptospirosis Outbreak Control Team would be the appropriate entity to discuss such issues and to collect the relevant data. It would be helpful if the data, and in particular the team's recommendations addressing the access of infected wild boar and cattle to the watercourses and water bodies, become public. In view of the nearing summer vacation with (national and international) tourism activity peaking, this information becomes acutely wished for.
