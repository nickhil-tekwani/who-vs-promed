At least 45 people have died and dozens more are being treated in hospitals in Indonesia after drinking illegally produced alcohol.

The death toll is likely to rise, with fatalities recorded in several provinces in recent days, police said.

Spirits bought on the black market in the Muslim-majority country can contain lethal amounts of methanol.

Police are conducting raids on properties across the country and at least 9 people have been arrested.

Some 100 people are believed to have consumed the bootleg alcohol, police said on [Tue 10 Apri 2018], with many of them in critical condition in hospital.

State of emergency
The deaths were recorded in Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, West Java and in the eastern province of Papua.

Authorities in Bandung, a major city in West Java, and its surrounding area east of Jakarta have declared a state of emergency, AFP news agency reports.

It is the country's worst liquor poisoning crisis in years.

Indonesia's commercial alcohol producers separate the methanol from their products, as it can be fatal in even tiny amounts.

It is not the 1st time, however, that bootleg liquor has claimed lives in the poorly regulated markets of Indonesia.

In 2016, at least 24 people died after consuming spirits sold illegally and made from ethanol, water and fruit.

At New Year celebrations in 2014, more than a dozen Indonesians died after drinking a similar cocktail.

[No clinical signs or symptoms are provided in this article. However, it appears the medical personnel are pretty certain this alcohol poisoning. There have already been deaths and it is expected there will be more in this situation.

Methanol (wood alcohol) is produced from the destructive distillation of wood. Epidemics of methanol toxicity have resulted from the consumption of methanol-contaminated whiskey or other alcohol products. The formation of 2 toxic metabolites, formaldehyde and formic acid, causes methanol poisoning. The elimination rate depends upon the folate pool. In primates, it is generally small, and consequently, primates (including humans) are more sensitive to methanol toxicity than other animals.

Methanol is widely available in formulations including antifreeze, windshield washer fluid, Sterno canned heat, shellacs, various paints, paint removers, varnishes, duplicating fluids, and gasoline additives.

Fatalities have been reported after ingestion of 15 ml or 3 teaspoons of a 40 per cent solution, although 30 ml is generally considered a minimal lethal dose. With aggressive medical care, it is possible to survive the ingestion of 500-600 ml. However, consumption of as little as 10 ml may cause blindness, depending on the amount and individual tolerance.

Methanol is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and peak levels occur generally within 30-90 minutes. It is distributed into tissues, so concentrations in the vitreous humor and optic nerve are high. The highest concentrations are found in the kidney, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, with smaller concentrations in the brain, muscle, and adipose tissues.

Methanol is oxidized 10 times more slowly than ethanol. Consequently, there is a longer elimination half-life.

Onset of symptoms varies between 40 minutes and 72 hours post-ingestion. Co-ingestion with alcohol will delay the appearance of symptoms, but the absence of symptoms does not exclude serious toxicity. The usual latent period is 12-24 hours.

Clinical signs may include headache, vertigo, lethargy, and confusion, which are common in mild to moderate ethanol intoxications. Coma and convulsions appear in severe cases, probably as a result of cerebral edema. Methanol produces little to no euphoria, unlike ethanol.

Blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, and photophobia (sensitivity to light) are common complaints. Constricted visual fields, fixed and dilated pupils, retinal edema, and hyperemia of the optic disk are common clinical findings. Prompt initial therapy is necessary to reverse symptoms; though visual defects have persisted in up to 25 per cent of severe cases.

Methanol is a mucosal irritant and may produce nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, not unlike large doses of ethanol.

Early in the clinical course, gut decontamination with ipecac or lavage may be indicated. However, if the methanol is mixed with ethanol, these patients may not realize something is out of the ordinary until it is too late for this type of treatment to be helpful.

Intravenous administration of ethanol in a 10 per cent dextrose solution may be helpful. As ethanol prolongs the elimination half-life of methanol, the treatment may take several days and the patient should be hospitalized. Dialysis may be necessary to prevent kidney failure as well. Hemodialysis remains an effective treatment. Fomepizole, an alcohol dehydrogenase competitive inhibitor, may also be used in the treatment of methanol toxicosis when available
