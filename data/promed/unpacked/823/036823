-------------
The samples collected were negative for influenza A /H1N1 and also tested negative for MERS CoV as well. [The samples] will be processed for RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] now.

Regarding the [hospital] admissions, multiple admissions on 1 bed/ incubator were observed in both tertiary care hospitals (Benazir Butto Hospital and Holy Family Hospitals). This shows the priority of government and scarcity/limitations of health facilities in Pakistan and especially in Punjab. This is routine practice to admit more than 1 child per bed, providing an opportunity for infection transmission.

[Rawalpindi's large hospitals are seeing hundreds of patients daily with acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) with the onset of winter; 70-80 percent of the illnesses are upper RTIs, but nearly 20 to 30 percent are lower RTIs, including mild to severe pneumonia; 50 to 60 children with severe pneumonia per day are requiring hospitalization. The majority of patients with pneumonia we are told are infants around the age of 6 months. However, no etiologic agents had apparently been identified at the time of the report.

For a discussion of pneumonia in children, please see my moderator comments in prior ProMED-mail posts below. ProMED-mail thanks the responder for the above response to a request for information concerning identification of the etiologic agents responsible for this outbreak and if pediatric admissions were being placed more than 1 to a bed or isolette, a practice that would facilitate nosocomial transmission of infectious agents.

Maps of Pakistan can be seen at http://www.mapsofworld.com/pakistan/pakistan-political-map.html and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3907955,825. Rawalpindi, with a population of about 2 million people in 2006, is a city located 14 km (9 mi) south of the capital city, Islamabad, in the province of Punjab, Pakistan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawalpindi). - Mod.ML
