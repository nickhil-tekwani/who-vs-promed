Wild animals continue to die of anthrax in large numbers in eastern
Caprivi, the deputy director for parks and wildlife management in the
Ministry of Environment told The Namibian yesterday [5 Oct 2004]. Sacky
Namugongo said the carcasses of 12 buffalo and 2 elephants have been
reported in the Makoma area since last week. They have already been burned
by the ministry's staff, he said.
"The situation is still not yet back to normal," said Namugongo, who
visited Caprivi last week to assess the situation. He said 29 animals had
died of anthrax since the outbreak towards the end of last month [Sep
2004]. This figure includes 22 buffalo and 7 elephants. Namugongo said his
ministry was still doing routine inspections and monitoring the situation.
The affected area, from Ngoma to Makoma and Kasika, is still cordoned off
to prevent the disease from spreading. Namugongo repeated his earlier call
to residents in the affected area to stay away from animal carcasses, as
anthrax is a very contagious disease. [Anthrax is not contagious. People
become infected via cuts and abrasions while butchering animals, and/or by
eating the contaminated meat. - Mod.MHJ]
Some domestic animals have also died of anthrax in eastern Caprivi. Last
week, the acting deputy director for animal disease control in the Ministry
of Agriculture, Dr Frans Joubert, told The Namibian that 9 cattle had died
in the area. Joubert said his Ministry was vaccinating all cattle in the
surrounding areas, and the process was going on smoothly. The vaccination
drive will later be extended to the rest of the Caprivi Region.
Anthrax is believed to have spread to the Caprivi from Botswana's Chobe
National Park, where 95 buffalo and 6 elephants recently died of the
disease. The Chobe National Park borders Namibia's eastern Caprivi area.
Namugongo also said his ministry was monitoring an outbreak of locusts that
is destroying grazing in eastern Caprivi.
