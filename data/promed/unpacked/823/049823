New techniques help trace heroin
--------------------------------
Forensic profiling has been developed in Glasgow to help trace the
source of heroin arriving on the streets of Scotland. The Scottish
Police Services Authority is analysing seized drugs to identify where
they were processed and stored. Scientists from the authority are also
studying the cutting or diluting agents to build a profile of the
supply chain. About 93 percent of the heroin in Britain comes from
Afghanistan and enters the country via the English Channel.

Gordon Meldrum, director general of the Scottish Crime and Drugs
Enforcement Agency, said: "It's being processed in Afghanistan or
generally in Turkey and sometimes in Pakistan. It will generally be
concealed within a heavy goods vehicle, but sometimes within a private
vehicle or a smaller van. It is then ready to be separated, sometimes
known as slaughtered within the trade, and put into separate batches
to go on different routes to the United Kingdom."

Police believe 3 main routes are used to transport the drug to the
Balkans [from Afghanistan]. Once there it is taken through mainland
Europe to Channel ports.

Intelligence is less clear, however, on the location of the
laboratories which process raw opium into heroin, and who is involved
in delivery. Scientists from the Scottish Police Service Authority are
now analysing recent seizures of heroin. They hope that DNA and
fingerprints found on packaging will provide a picture of where the
drug is being warehoused. Evidence of the material used to adulterate
the opium will also strengthen intelligence about where it is being
processed.

Drug profiling
--------------
By comparing samples, detectives hope to work out where the supply
chain splits and who is involved.

The forensic work is being done under the direction of Tom Nelson who
said the aim was to discover where heroin was being manufactured.
"Depending on the manufacturing routes we can actually tell a bit more
about where the drug came from," he said. "As we do more profiling on
drugs we can tell, potentially, the route that that drug has travelled
to get on to the streets of Scotland."

Bob Lauder, deputy director in Scotland of the Serious and Organised
Crime Agency, said any new information would be of great use to its
200 officers posted in 40 countries throughout Europe and Asia. "If
you do a forensic analysis we can then identify commonality of product
which takes us back to single suppliers, single warehousemen, and
those people who produce it," he said. "We can actually use that to
better inform where the chain meets together and separates and that
makes our future intelligence better."

[This BBC report is 16 months old but it provides some background,
even if dated. I went through my 1988-2008 notes for anthrax in the
Balkan countries. For what it is worth: Albania: enzootic in
livestock; 2007, 82 human cases; 2008, 33 human cases. From our
genomic studies it is largely an A1.a country. Bosnia: sporadic
Bulgaria: sporadic but low numbers of human cases each year. Greece:
enzootic but recently livestock outbreak numbers are reduced;
routinely seen in humans. Kosovo: sporadic. Macedonia: sporadic with
human cases each year. Montenegro: sporadic. Serbia: sporadic with
human cases. - Mod.MHJ]

Men jailed over biggest heroin seizure
--------------------------------------
Three men were jailed today [11 Jan 2010] for their parts in a GBP 33
million drugs deal that led to the biggest heroin seizure made by
British police, Scotland Yard said. [The 3 men, aged, 32, 35, and 30],
were convicted of conspiracy to supply heroin after officers seized
nearly 730 lb (330 kg) of the substance at a motorway service station
in 2008.

Kingston Crown Court sentenced [the 32-year-old], of Upton Lane, near
Stratford, east London, to 17 years, [the 35-year-old], of Brixham
Gardens, Ilford, east London, to 15 and a half years, and [the
30-year-old], of Cavendish Gardens, Ilford, to 23 years. His trial
heard that a 37-year-old Dutchman drove a BMW estate through Customs
at Dover in Kent on the afternoon of 8 Apr 2008.

A few hours later police stopped [the Dutchman] at a service station
near Maidstone and found 11 large boxes of heroin in his car. [The
32-year-old convicted man] had arrived at the services shortly
beforehand, and police discovered that a further 2 boxes of the drug
had been transferred to his Seat Leon. Together the 13 boxes contained
729 lb (330.7 kg) of heroin, with a street value of more than GBP 33
million, the court was told.

[The 35-year-old man] pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin in
September 2008, [the 32-year-old] was found guilty of the same offence
last June [2009], and [the 30-year-old] was convicted in December
[2009]. [The Dutchman] was found guilty of importing the heroin and
jailed for 26 years at an earlier hearing.

Detective inspector Marion Ryan, from the Met's central task force,
said: "This is the biggest heroin seizure we know of by any UK police
force. Today's [11 Jan 2010] result is testimony to how the Met has
prevented the serious consequences this conspiracy could have had on
people's lives."

[This recent conviction report would indicate that the facts in the
2008 BBC report are still relevant. - Mod.MHJ]

[The figures boggle the mind. There are an estimated 280 000 problem
drug users in the UK, most taking heroin and crack cocaine (and around
2500 deaths a year). 140 000 heroin users needing 1 gram for 10-50
hits, averaging 3 hits a day, depending on level of addiction, would
consume 140 kg, so 330 kg wouldn't go that far. Much more than this
must be being smuggled in every year. - Mod.JW]
