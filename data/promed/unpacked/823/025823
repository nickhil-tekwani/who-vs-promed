Re: Announcements, 1999 (01), Announcement [5] listed an inaccurate
Internet
address for the CDC/WHO manual "Infection Control for Viral Haemorrhagic
Fevers
in the African Health Care Setting."
When this manual is available online, the actual URL will be
http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/vhfmanual.htm.
Please note that this website will be available shortly.

[We posted the address we were given by CDC <kfc1@cdc.gov>. Everyone,
please
check the URLs you ask us to post BEFORE sending; our experience is that
fully
50% have mistakes in them. We don't have the time to check them out, &
in this
case we couldn't anyway because the URL is not yet operational - Mod.JW]
