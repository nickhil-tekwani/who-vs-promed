A 16-month-old toddler died from hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in
Sarawak on Tuesday, bringing the death toll from the illness in 2006 to 9,
officials said.
The boy was admitted to a hospital in Miri on Saturday in critical
condition and could not be saved because his parents had sought treatment
too late, Sarawak Deputy Chief Minister George Chan was quoted as saying by
national news agency Bernama.
Chan said 7857 infections have been reported in the state this year, but
the number of new cases has declined and only 39 patients remain hospitalised.
Authorities in Sarawak in early March 2006 shut all 1600 kindergartens,
day-care centers and preschools to stop the disease from spreading among
children -- the main victims of the illness. The premises reopened Monday
after the number of infections fell.
Chan said health officials would beef up enforcement and inspection of all
education premises, and those found to have 2 or more cases would be
immediately closed until cleared of the disease. State health officials
could not be reached for comments.
Hand, foot and mouth disease is mildly contagious and rarely fatal. It
mainly strikes children below age 10 and is unrelated to the illness in
cattle known as foot and mouth disease.
Officials said the disease seems to emerge cyclically every 3 years in
Sarawak. It spread this year to neighbouring Brunei, where a boy died
recently of the disease. Some children in Kedah were also affected but no
deaths were reported.
