Leaf blight affecting tomatoes when nearing harvest has farmers worrying about their crops in Jajpur district. It might lead to heavy loss if the disease is not checked from spreading further. Observers claimed that leaf blight disease happens due to fungal infection and advised to use pesticide with constraint. They also advised to conduct awareness programme to sensitise the farmers about the disease.

However, the [local] agriculture department has failed to be of any help. The farmers are also not seeking the assistance of farm experts to contain the disease. They are buying pesticide from the market. As a result, wrong use of pesticide results in crop loss and reduced output.

[A] scientist at the Krishi Vigyan Kendra [agricultural extension centre] in Jajpur said that the disease has affected the crop as the farmers do not treat the seeds before cultivation. He advised farmers to treat seeds and contact the agriculture scientist before making use of pesticide on their crops.

[A number of tomato diseases have been reported from the region; many of them can also affect potatoes and other solanaceous crops. Leaf blight symptoms, as mentioned above, can be due to a number of mainly fungal and bacterial pathogens. For example, late blight of tomato and potato (caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora infestans_) is rife in the region, with a severe strain spreading there (ProMED-mail post 20180418.5755980). It is not clear whether this disease has been excluded as a possibility.

The problems above may also be due to a combination of pathogens and/or other factors. Reliable molecular diagnosis of any pathogen(s) involved will be needed in order to be able to design suitable management strategies for the farmers. However, the recommendation above to make use of seed treatments and expert advice in the meantime is certainly sound.
