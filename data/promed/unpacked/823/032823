On 2 March this year [2012], 125 Nigerians on Arik Airlines plane to Johannesburg were denied entry and deported by the South African port health authority. The authority had concerns about the validity of the yellow fever vaccination cards, which the passengers had as proof of having been vaccinated against yellow fever. Nigeria reciprocated by deporting more than 60 South Africans; thus a diplomatic feud ensued until South Africa apologised.

Yellow fever, which is a viral haemorrhagic fever, is endemic in West Africa since 50 per cent of the population is not vaccinated. And Nigeria, according to a WHO report, is at risk of a yellow fever outbreak while South Africa is not.

[A worker] at one of the airlines' stalls at the international airport said: "Yes, the fake cards were being sold freely before the disagreement between South Africa and Nigeria, but now things are a little different. I would even advise you to get vaccinated. It would help you and it is cheaper; it is just N500 [USD 3.12]. People buy the fake cards because they want to get it for someone else or they don't want to be injected."

A visit by The Nation to the Port Health Services at MMIA ascertained the persistence of the fake cards. The Chief Nursing Officer, who did not acquiesce to the publication of her name in print, said, "The fake yellow fever cards, which had been seized by the Port Authority from passengers, still bear 1969 as the year of issue. Whereas it has been reviewed; now the new original ones bear 2005.

"Also, there are traits common with fake cards. They usually carry stamps of fictional hospitals and names of vaccines that are no longer administered, such as Cholera vaccine that is only administered to people going on the hajj pilgrimage. These touts often write CMS, the bus stop, instead of CSM (cerebro-spinal meningitis) vaccine on the fake cards."

She revealed that the latest real stamp by the Port Health Services was "PORT HEALTH OFFICER, MURTALA MOHD INT. AIRPORT, HEADQUARTERS IKEJA" also with the impression of the Nigerian Coat of Arms. She contrasted it with the fake cards that bore stamps like: "MEDICAL OFFICE OF HEALTH, LAGOS ISLAND, L.G. CITY HALL LAGOS", "MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH", and "PORT HEALTH SERVICES, FEDERAL MINISTRY OF HEALTH, M.M INTER. AIRPORT, IKEJA". Other fakes have only the Coat of Arms imprinted on them. She said some fake cards had Oshodi and Ikeja as locations of non-existing hospitals.

She described the incorrect vaccine batch numbers that were filled in the counterfeit cards. These, particularly, were the features the South African Port Health Authority said they found unrecognisable and unacceptable. She said of intending passengers interested in fake cards, "These people claim they are healthy. They say, 'I don't have malaria; I don't have fever.' They don't know yellow fever is a disease on its own and the vaccine prevents it. Yellow fever has the tendency to perforate any organ. It can kill a lot of people within 72 hours."

Known symptoms of yellow fever are jaundice (yellowness of the skin and membranes), congestion of the face, widespread haemorrhage, nausea, and vomiting of blood. According to Wikipedia, every year, 30 000 deaths out of 200 000 cases of yellow fever occur in endemic areas.

The Chief Nursing Officer, who is also a community health expert said: "The essence of vaccination is to prevent trans-boundary communication of the disease. We shouldn't let citizens of this country infect citizens of another country, and vice-versa."

It should be noted that danger associated with the international transmission of yellow fever is the high mortality that accompanies the infection of population that has not been infected (non-endemic areas), while natives in endemic areas are relatively protected by acquired immunity.

On the status of the relationship of the Port Health Services with South Africa, the Chief Nursing Officer said, "South Africa does not accept vaccination cards from any other health facility, be it University of Benin Teaching Hospital or University College Hospital. They only accept those of Port Health Services. Also, there is a secret way we fill the original cards, and this is only known by us and the Port Health officers in South Africa." She, however, did not say if any secret arrangements had been made with other countries to ensure authenticity of the cards.

She lamented the plight and ignorance of those who were deported in the past for possessing fake cards, "A woman and her daughter had purchased the fake cards at N2500 [USD 15.58] per card, only to be sent back to Nigeria. Deportees had bought the fake cards because of sheer ignorance, and because Nigerians just like short-cut to everything. These people don't know that the yellow fever vaccine should be administered 10 days before travelling, because it is by this time the traveller would be immunised. Also, some travel agents had also helped prospective travellers acquire fake yellow fever vaccination cards."

A prospective traveller in the queue at the departure section of MMIA, who refused to be named, showed his yellow fever vaccination card. It was worn out and did not have the real stamp of the Port Health Services; it only had the Nigerian Coat of Arms imprint. "I have been using this card for a while. My agent procured it for me. It cost N1000 [USD 6.24]. I wasn't given any injection; In Nigeria, we don't do that jare [sic]."

When asked if she would attribute the sale of fake cards to laxity in the manner the Port Health Services officers discharge their duty, the Chief Nursing Officer said: "We had the vaccines, but travellers did not come. Even though it was just N500 [USD 3.12] and we administered the vaccine to them, they would rather buy the expensive fake ones without being vaccinated. However, after the South Africa problem, a lot of people have been coming here to get vaccinated. We also have a 24-hour operational clinic at the airport where people can be vaccinated."

This reporter saw would-be passengers being vaccinated at the MMIA clinic. When a nurse was asked if the yellow fever vaccination cards could be obtained without vaccination or for someone else, she said, "No."

On the implementation of plans by the Federal Government to curb the peddling of the fake cards, the Chief Nursing Officer said: "Directives have been given to the Nigerian Air Force and State Secret Service to arrest those printing and selling the cards. The Federal Government has said it would commission the Central Bank of Nigeria to formulate and print new cards so that they will not be easily copied."

The yellow fever vaccination card, also known as International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, had been used to certify vaccinations against yellow fever, cholera and smallpox for a long time. It could also be used to certify other vaccinations that individual countries may require before entry is permitted.

After the certificate was revised in 2005, only yellow fever vaccination remained mandatory. In 1973, Cholera vaccine was stopped, while WHO declared on 8 May 1980 the eradication of small pox. Immunisation against yellow fever lasts for 10 years.

Comment from a website reader:
"Thank You For Enlightening Us On This Issue; Though It Will Take A Tout To Patronise A Tout. But Your Explanations Will Only Give These Touts The Insights To Change Their Modus Operandi (Mode Of Operation) A They Will Start Putting All These Fixtures You Mentioned. Trust Nigerians On That!

Another Comment from a website reader:
"It is not only touts that are selling the yellow fever cards without the injection, even the officials i.e. nurses at the government hospitals are guilty of the same offence. I visited the local health centre at Aderemi Street, Ile-Ife, Osun State in 2011 to receive yellow fever injection with the card as I was to travel to South Africa. I was made to pay the official fee, but the nurse told me that they did not have the injection. I protested and she went to call a senior colleague who just reiterated the same statement that I heard earlier. I had no option than to take the card without the injection because I needed to travel to South Africa for an important assignment.

"I got to the Murtala Muhammed international airport where I was to be cleared by the health officials who are recently posted there. I was told by them that the dose written on the card was not correct. I asked them to write it themselves, and they borrowed a black pen from me and they wrote it. The question now is that how do you confirm or crosscheck a document that is not linked to a database? If those guys at the airport was to confirm the authenticity of my card, then they will have to travel to Ile-Ife that night to confirm. Even if they have done that, they would have not being able to confirm because those officials at the health centre at Ile-Ife also were not keeping records. So fellow Nigerians let us face it, we still have a long way to go. May God bless Nigeria, the land of my birth."

[Human yellow fever cases do occur in Nigeria from time-to-time (see ProMED-mail archives below). There is the risk that an individual viremic with yellow fever (YF) virus could enter a YF virus-free country using a fake immunization document, and if _Aedes_ mosquito vectors were present, an outbreak could be started. Sale of fake immunization cards presents a serious public health problem, and local health authorities are entirely justified in denying entry into the country of individuals attempting to use them. One hopes that the response of the South African health authorities in the above situation sends a clear message that issuance of fake immunization cards will not be tolerated, and the Nigerian government will crack down on those who sell them.

***Administration of YF virus vaccine at the airport immediately before embarking on a flight does not provide the 10 days needed for an adequate immune response. - Mod.TY]

[2] Ghana ex Nigeria

A diplomatic row may soon arise between Nigeria and Ghana as the country is said to be denying Nigerians entry over alleged fake yellow fever [immunization] cards.

Some Nigerian travellers to Accra told The Guardian that they were recently subjected to inhuman treatment at the Kotoka International Airport, Accra, over yellow fever vaccination.

The Guardian learnt that all the yellow fever cards from Nigeria were presumed fake and international passports of such Nigerians seized with the Ghanaian immigration officials insisting that the affected persons get Ghana's yellow fever cards at the cost of N2000 [USD 12.48] before their documents could be released to them.

According to one of the affected Nigerians, "on 29 Jun 2012, there were 2 last flights by Aero and Arik that landed almost simultaneously at about 6.10 p.m. Nigerian time. Immediately, the health officials mounted an unconventional roadblock on the way to the immigration points. Every vaccination card issued in Nigeria was presumed fake. We were all asked to move to the side after all our international passports have been seized.

"New vaccination cards were issued to us after injecting us with the vaccine and a fee of N2000 charged for that which was paid in Nigerian currency. Charging for this in Naira is curious. A pregnant woman was issued only with a card when she told them she is pregnant but only after parting with N2000," he added.

He said attention was not paid to new international arrivals consisting of whites and blacks on board, stressing that on inquiry, "the health officials claimed ignorance of such arrivals, disclosing that they were only after Nigerians."

"We were held for hours that day. To confirm extortion of money from Nigerians, why should they collect money from a pregnant woman who was not jabbed with an injection? Why should we be paying in Naira and why should every yellow fever card issued in Nigeria be presumed fake? Do the health officials of foreign countries have the powers to seize the passports of travellers/visitors to their countries?" he queried.

A diplomat, who spoke to The Guardian on condition of anonymity, said the Federal Government was already studying the ugly situation, not only in Ghana but around the world, just as he said that the Nigerian authority had made it known that it would provide protection for her law-abiding citizens around the globe.

According to the source, "the Federal Government has reached out to its Ghanaian counterpart and [they] are discussing ways to end the alleged hostilities."

[The Nigerians were neither turned back nor denied entry -- they were forcibly vaccinated and charged 4 times what they would have paid for it in Nigeria. But the reporter did not point that out, nor that protection does not kick in for 10 days and the incubation period of YF is only 3-6 days. - Mod.JW]

[This is a good example of the loss of confidence by national health authorities resulting from the earlier fraudulent sale of fake YF vaccination cards. Now, all Nigerian YF vaccination cards are likely to be suspect. - Mod.TY
