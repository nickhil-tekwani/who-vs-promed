[A couple of noteworthy items pertain to this posting. In the 1st place,
there are over 80 outbreaks reported here, far too many to report
individually but the farm by farm breakdown is available from the
referenced source above. And 2ndly, the case fatality rate is an order of
magnitude higher in sheep at 38.71 percent than cattle. Finally, it is
instructive to look at the map of the outbreak as referenced in the
OIE-WAHID report given above. While the outbreak is designated as limited
geographical in this report and is confined at this point to the western
part of Germany, it is now spread over a very large part of
Nordrhein-Westfallen as well as parts of Hessin and Rheinland-Pfalz. - Mod.PC]
