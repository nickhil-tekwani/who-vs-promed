Vascular wilt diseases have recently become a
serious problem on tomato (_Lycopersicon
esculentum_) throughout the Tunisian Sahel. Since
2002, plants of cv. 'Colibri' with symptoms
characteristic of Verticillium infection
(wilting, yellowing, stunting and dark brown
vascular discoloration) have been seen in many
greenhouses in the Chott Mariem region (Fig. 1).
Isolates from diseased plants were identified as
_Verticillium dahliae_ on the basis of
microsclerotium production (Hawksworth & Talboys,
1970). The cultivar 'Colibri' carries a single
dominant gene (Ve) conferring resistance to race
1 of _V. dahliae_ (Schaible et al., 1951). This
resistance has been effective for over 20 years.
Wilt caused by _V. dahliae_ has also been
confirmed in several other resistant cultivars
(e.g. Amel, Cenkara, Rio Grande) (Fig.2). A total
of 51 Tunisian isolates were tested to determine
their race, with Canadian and Israeli race 1 and
2 isolates (one each) were included as controls.
Conidial suspensions of 107 conidia per ml were
used to inoculate plants of the cultivars
'Ventura' and 'Sun 6200' (susceptible to both
races), and 'Rio Grande', 'Colibri' an 'Naya'
(resistant to race 1), at the 2-leaf stage by
root dipping. Seedlings were replanted into a
sterile 2:1 mixture of peat/perlite (v/v) and
maintained in a growth chamber at 23 ï¿½ 3deg C.
Equal numbers of plants of each cultivar were
dipped into water as controls. The experimental
design was a completely randomized type with ten
replicates (pots). Tests were conducted twice.
Susceptible plants developed typical symptoms of
wilt as above, starting 2-3 weeks after
inoculation, followed by plant death. Race 1
isolates gave either no or only very mild
symptoms in the resistant cultivars. Control
plants showed no symptoms. In cultivars where
infection occurred, most plants developed typical
symptoms. _V. dahliae_ was recovered by plating
from all plants with symptoms. Based on the
differential reactions of the 5 cultivars, 10
isolates were classified as race 1 and 41 as race 2.

The appearance of _V. dahliae_ race 2 in tomatoes
in Tunisia poses a major threat to this crop,
particularly in protected cultivation where no
rotations are used and the absence of soil
disinfection favours the build-up of soil-borne
inoculum. _V. dahliae_ race 2 has been reported
from southern Europe, North and South America and
North and South Africa (Pegg & Brady, 2002) but
this is the first report from Tunisia.

[The crop plant tomato, _Lycopersicon
esculentum_, develops symptoms of the disease
Verticillium wilt, when infected by the fungus
_Verticillium dahliae_. Once a plant is infected,
part of the leaflet lamina wilts in the shape of
a "V". This is accompanied by inner vein
yellowing, which begins unilaterally and is, in
turn, followed by a desiccation of the leaves at
the base of the plant. The vessels are coloured
light brown or light gray. The affected plants do
not die. Inoculum source is normally from
resting structures of the fungus (microsclerotia) in infested soil.
This article describes the 1st detection of race
2 of the fungus in Tunisia. Race 1 is common in
Tunisia, and the local tomato varieties grown
under protected structures
(screenhouses/greenhouses) while resistant to
race 1, develop Verticillium wilt when attacked
by race 2. Race 2 of _V. dahliae_, virulent on
cultivars with the Ve gene that provides
resistance to Race 1, was first detected in 1957
and later reported in North and South America,
Europe, Africa and Australia. Until recently
[2005] screenings of tomato germplasm have not
revealed a reliable source of resistance to race
2, but a factor conferring resistance in the Veda
line has been mobilized by conventional breeding
and is dominantly inherited. Grafting of
susceptible scions onto resistant rootstocks is
one possible approach to managing this soilborne
disease when soil sterilization/disinfection is
not acceptable or practiced, which seems to be
the case in Tunisia. Fungicidal treatment of
infected plants is largely ineffective against Verticillium wilt of tomatoes.
