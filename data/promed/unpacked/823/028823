Nation's 1st MERS case strikes: Omani man, 75, quarantined after testing positive
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Public Health Ministry has confirmed the 1st case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus infection in the country [Thailand] as medical authorities gave assurances they will do all they can to prevent the spread of the virus.

Public Health Minister Rajata Rajatanavin said Thursday [18 Jun 2015] a 75-year-old man from Oman has tested positive for the deadly virus. The man, whose identity has not been revealed, was admitted to a private hospital on Monday [15 Jun 2015] for heart disease treatment.

This prompted hospital staff to take stringent measures to prevent any possible spread of the MERS virus. Samples of phlegm taken from the patient were tested several times before it was confirmed that the patient had contracted the virus.

The patient was transferred to the Public Health Ministry's Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute in Nonthaburi's Muang district Thursday [18 Jun 2015] morning.

The man has now been quarantined at the institute. His condition remains stable, Dr Rajata said.

Upon the man's arrival at Suvarnabhumi airport, he had no fever, but he began coughing and had difficulty breathing when he was admitted to the private hospital, the minister said.

Dr Rajata said authorities are now monitoring 59 people suspected of coming into contact with the patient during and after his journey to Thailand on the aeroplane.

They include 3 of his family members who travelled with him, passengers who sat near him on the plane, cabin crew, medical staff at the private hospital and 2 taxi drivers.

The family members have been invited to stay at the institute, Dr Rajata said, adding that authorities will contact others to seek updates on their health condition.

Dr Rajata urged the public to remain calm because the patient has now been quarantined and is under close observation.

Prasert Thongcharoen, a professor emeritus who is an adviser to the Disease Control Department, said the patient is an Omani national and made a living as a fisherman there. Camels are thought to be carriers of the virus but there are none in his home town of Jalan.

The man told doctors he had avoided contact with camels, although he said he drank camel's milk, said Dr Prasert, who chairs a committee of experts on virology and epidemiology at the department. The man arrived in Thailand on Monday [15 Jun 2015] on Oman Air flight WY0815. His family checked into a hotel in Sukhumvit Soi 3.

Dr Prasert gave assurances that every effort will be made to contain the spread of the disease.

"We are confident we can prevent the disease from spreading," he said.

Thanarak Phaliphat, director of the Epidemiology Bureau under the Disease Control Department, said authorities will regularly telephone those who came into contact with the patient and will ask them to stop work temporarily.

Next week, authorities will visit each of them again and continue to monitor their condition for another 2 weeks, Dr Thanarak said.

Apichai Mongkol, chief of the Medical Sciences Department, said the private hospital that admitted the patient sent liquid samples from the patient for several lab tests at 4 different universities, before it was confirmed the man was infected with MERS.

Deputy government spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd said the government is confident the Public Health Ministry will be able to contain the virus.

The ministry has followed steps to control and prevent the spread of the virus, Maj Gen Sansern said, adding that efforts will be made to ensure the patient receives the best possible treatment.

Flight Lieutenant Pratana Pattanasiri, THAI's vice-president overseeing aviation safety, security and standards, said the airline had set out 7 strict measures to deal with the MERS virus, including the screening of passengers before checking in, and observing the health conditions of passengers during their journeys.

The airline is also disinfecting air­line cabins and mo­nitoring the hygiene of airline staff, he said.

[The above media report mentions the MERS-CoV infected individual did not have contact with camels but did drink camel's milk -- if the camel's milk was unpasteurized, the possibility of contamination with MERS-CoV is there -- especially if the camel was still feeding a calf as the juvenile camels have a higher prevalence of active MERS-CoV infection. As mentioned in the 1st post on this case, the next few weeks will be telltale as to whether there will be secondary cases amongst the close family contacts, hospital staff admitting the patient and other individuals prior to the isolation of the patient.

[Today's update is optimistic as there was only one newly confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection reported in the past 24 hours. There was also one new fatality reported, in an individual who was reported as newly confirmed yesterday (17 Jun 2015).

Hopefully this is an indicator that the control measures implemented are impacting and slowing down transmission. Fortunately another "super spreader" has not appeared, and contacts with other cases are fewer and spread around rather than all focused on a few select cases.

An indicator of the massive efforts on the part of the MOH is the volume of contacts being monitored in quarantine... today's total is 5930 as 12 percent decrease from yesterday's (17 Jun 2015) when there were 6629 individuals under quarantine.

[In the ProMED-mail post on 16 Jun 2015 announcing the death of a 50-year-old Saudi male in Hufoof, I mentioned there had been 2 cases in 50-year-old men reported from Saudi Arabia during the early part of June 2015. What I neglected to note was that one of the cases was in a Saudi non-healthcare worker and the other was in an expat healthcare worker. The former case was reported as a fatality on 16 Jun 2015, and the latter reported as a recovery today, 18 Jun 2015. I apologize for any confusion my error may have created.

Imported case of MERS-CoV infection identified in China, May 2015: Detection and lesson learned
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the end of May 2015, an imported case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection was confirmed in China. The patient is in a stable condition and is still undergoing treatment. In this report, we summarise the preliminary findings for this imported case and the results of contact tracing. We identified 78 close contacts and after 14 days of monitoring and isolation, none of the contacts presented symptoms and all tested negative for MERS-CoV.

Case report
On 27 May 2015, the Chinese Ministry of Health was notified by the World Health Organization (WHO) of a suspected case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection who had travelled from South Korea to Guangdong province, China, one day earlier. The case is a man in his 40s (Patient C) who was symptomatic during his travel but had not revealed his history of close contact with a confirmed MERS case during his stay in South Korea. The person was identified on 28 May [2015]. Medical staff wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) accompanied him to the closest hospital where he was treated in isolation in a negative pressure room. To reduce the risk of further transmission, strict infection control measures have been taken in hospital. Case investigation revealed that the man had been exposed to the 1st confirmed MERS case in South Korea (Patient A) who shared a ward with the father (Patient B) of Patient C. After confirmation of MERS-CoV as the cause of illness of Patient A on 20 May [2015], contact tracing confirmed MERS-CoV in Patient B on 21 May [2015]. Patient C began feeling unwell on the same day because of back pain but he had no respiratory symptoms. On 25 May [2015], his sister (Patient D) was reported to be the 4th confirmed MERS case in South Korea. On the same day, a temperature of 38.7 deg C was recorded for Patient C. The next day, on 26 May [2015], against medical advice, the man travelled by plane from South Korea to Hong Kong directly, and then took 2 consecutive buses from Hong Kong airport to his destination in Guangdong province, mainland China. He stayed at Hotel A overnight and on the following day he attended meetings all day and spent the night in Hotel B until he was identified and placed in isolation. According to his quarantine form, he had fever (39.7 deg C) but did not report his history of exposure to a MERS case upon entry into Hong Kong. Once identified and admitted to hospital on 28 May [2015], clinical examination revealed a temperature of 39.5 deg C and non-productive cough. Over the following 3 days, his condition worsened. Chest x-ray showed that he had bilateral hilar infiltrates. He received ribavirin twice a day for 2 days, and once daily afterwards. As of [18 Jun 2015], the patient remains under treatment in stable condition in hospital and would be discharged if there is no viral shedding observed for 3 consecutive days. The Figure illustrates the timeline of events for this case. (Figure [available at the source URL]. Timeline of events for the 1st imported case of MERS-CoV infection (Patient C) identified in China, May-June 2015.)

Laboratory findings
Diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was performed based on the real-time RT-PCR method, using a target upstream of envelope gene (upE) as a screening test and the open reading frame (ORF) 1b gene as the confirmatory assay. MERS-CoV infection was 1stly confirmed in Guangdong Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on 28 May [2015] and re-confirmed on 29 May [2015] by the national CDC in Beijing. Genome sequences were shared for assessment of possible virological changes through collaborations with the Collaborative Management Platform for detection and Analyses of (Re-) emerging and foodborne outbreaks in Europe (COMPARE) project (http://www.compare-europe.eu). Extensive follow-up sampling was carried out to monitor the evolution of the infection (Table). (Table. Real-time RT-PCR results for an imported case of MERS-CoV infection, China, May-June 2015 [available at source URL].)

MERS-CoV RNA was detected over 8 days after fever onset, in serum samples, but only in the 1st 4 days in throat swabs. Sputum was collected and the result of the test was positive for MERS-CoV from Day 7 when pneumonia was detected. We tested 2 faecal samples and obtained positive results on Day 10 and 15. Sample collection and testing are still ongoing.

Contact tracing
Contact tracing was conducted immediately after the confirmation of MERS-CoV infection. According to the guidelines of the National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China (PRC), stewards and passengers seated 2 rows in front and behind the case and persons who had prolonged (greater than 15 min) face-to-face contact with the confirmed case, in any community settings (hotels, restaurants, conference rooms) were all defined as close contacts. They were included on the mandatory contact investigation list, because the case was symptomatic and potentially contagious. On 28 May [2015], a press release was issued to inform the general public about the MERS case. Information including the travel routes of this case and preventive measures was made public via TV channels and Internet to facilitate efficient contact tracing. As of [2 Jun 2015], a total of 78 close contacts including hotel staff (n=27), company employees (n=19), restaurant waiters (n=13), bus passengers (n=13), plane passengers (n=6) (passengers who stayed in Hong Kong were monitored by the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection) were identified and monitored in isolation for 14 days after their last contact with the confirmed case. After 14 days of isolation, none of the contacts presented symptoms compatible with MERS-CoV infection. Throat swabs were collected on their 1st and last day of quarantine and all were negative for MERS-CoV. Strict infection control measures have been taken in hospital; healthcare workers used PPE during management of this patient and therefore, they were not considered as close contacts. However, for safety reasons, serum samples were collected from 53 healthcare workers on [10 Jun 2015]; all were MERS-CoV negative and the follow-up is still ongoing.

Discussion
MERS-CoV is a newly emergent subgroup C betacoronavirus, with a high mortality of ca [around] 40 percent [1]. As of 31 May 2015, at least 1150 laboratory-confirmed cases including 431 related deaths have been reported to WHO [2]. Although the majority of cases occurred in countries in the Arabian Peninsula, MERS cases involving international travel occurred in at least 15 countries [3-5].

The WHO risk assessment for MERS-CoV indicated that cases will continue to be exported to other countries as a result of international travelling [2]. Here, we reported the 1st imported case of MERS-CoV infection identified in mainland China, related to the ongoing MERS cluster in South Korea. The 1st identified MERS case in South Korea was a traveler returning from the Arabian Peninsula. Unlike the situation for previously reported travel-associated MERS cases, onward transmission has been recently observed in South Korea, suggesting that human-to-human transmission could occur in countries outside the Arabian Peninsula and that these countries should also maintain a high level of vigilance. The WHO has published guidelines for case investigation including contact tracing since the 1st identification of MERS-CoV infection [6]. Control measures including quarantine of suspected cases, which have been proven effective in preventing the further spread of acute infectious diseases, may be hampered in countries with no supporting regulation in place. Therefore, in our view, without appropriate legislation, it may be more difficult to implement these recommendations. As illustrated by this incident that required a massive public health effort, infectious diseases are a global issue. While no contacts became infected in China, the spread in South Korea shows that secondary infection does constitute a risk. Therefore, until more is understood about the epidemiology and factors contributing to the spread of MERS-CoV, we believe that mandatory close monitoring and investigation of all close contacts are crucial.

This incident highlights vulnerabilities and gaps of our surveillance system, not all of which can be addressed. The early presentation of MERS-CoV or other emerging infections may not be specific [7]. Fever was observed when the case arrived in Hong Kong, but without active reporting of the previous high-risk exposure, it was reasonable not to initiate further investigation. There was no health check for this case at the entry point in mainland China, since MERS-CoV-related inquiry at entry point of mainland China mainly targets travellers returning from the Middle East. The increased number of countries outside the Arabian Peninsula affected by MERS-CoV highlights the need for enhanced awareness on the presence of the virus in travellers with fever from countries with ongoing epidemics. During our investigation, we observed sometimes people preferred not to disclose their history of exposure to a MERS case because of insufficient knowledge on the disease and its associated risks, or on the public health actions around it. Education of the public about MERS-CoV including symptoms, transmission modes, infection and prevention measures and risks, are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV.

In this study, MERS-CoV RNA was detected in throat swabs only in the 1st 2 days of sampling after hospitalisation (4 days after fever onset), while increased viral loads were observed in sputum 7 days after fever onset when pneumonia was detected. This was consistent with previous studies that recommend that lower respiratory tract samples be given a high priority for MERS-CoV diagnosis especially in patients presenting late in their disease course with lower respiratory involvement [8,9]. We also obtained positive results when we tested stool and serum samples. Due to the possibility of viral shedding, comprehensive precautions for healthcare workers managing probable or confirmed MERS cases, are important. So far, data on MERS-CoV shedding were very rare and have shown different MERS-CoV detection profiles [10-12]. The complete viral load profiles from a large number of patients are essential for establishing infection control measures and their necessary duration. This can also be used to monitor possible early signs of virus change: the apparent deep respiratory tract tropism of MERS-CoV in this patient was an indication that the virus causing the large cluster in South Korea did not behave differently, as concluded from the initial sequence data (data not shown). Subtle changes in the virus-host interaction that would lead to increased replication in the upper respiratory tract could potentially lead to much more efficient transmission. Therefore, detailed virological monitoring, in addition to case and contact investigations, is crucial for monitoring evolution of emerging infectious diseases.

[This article is an excellent step in the right direction contributing to our knowledge and understanding of MERS-CoV infections and when virus is detectable. Notable is the finding that "MERS-CoV RNA was detected over 8 days after fever onset, in serum samples, but only in the 1st 4 days in throat swabs. Sputum was collected and the result of the test was positive for MERS-CoV from Day 7 when pneumonia was detected. We tested 2 faecal samples and obtained positive results on Day 10 and 15."

Note that there were 5 days between the observation of cough and fever of the imported case and the documentation of hilar infiltrates on X-ray (evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray) -- one wonders how many mild cases are missed because MERS-CoV is not thought of until the appearance of the pulmonary infiltrates?

MERS Virus Migrates to One More Country. What Will Contain It?
--------------------------------------------------------------
A respiratory virus that originates in the Middle East and has been hopscotching the globe for 3 years has today [18 Jun 2015] landed in yet another country, just as international health officials are raising concerns about the conditions that allow it to spread.

The virus is called MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and this morning Thai officials revealed that it has landed there via a medical tourist from the Persian Gulf state of Oman, who arrived in Bangkok to be treated for a heart condition. Three family members traveled with him, and all 4 are under quarantine, while passengers who sat near them on their flight are being sought and watched.

MERS originates in the Middle East); it may cross to people from camels, and was 1st spotted in a hospital patient in Saudi Arabia. It has spread so slowly that most concern about it has bubbled at a fairly low level, even though, according to the World Health Organization, it has reached 2 dozen countries so far: 25 as of last week, plus Thailand today [18 Jun 2015].

But the Thai discovery happens to come one day after an emergency committee empaneled by the WHO expressed concern over how quickly MERS blew up in another of those countries, South Korea. Except among disease obsessives, that outbreak has not been much noticed -- but just since May [2015], 164 people in South Korea have been confirmed ill and 23 have died, and a known-infected patient has migrated from South Korea to China. More than 10 000 Koreans were or are in quarantine either in hospitals or at home, including a village that was shut off from the world despite experiencing just one case.

In a report and press conference yesterday [17 Jun 2015], the WHO committee -- which despite having "emergency" in its name was meeting for the 9th time in 2 years -- said that the virus spread mostly through hospital contact because of inadequate protective measures.

"In some instances there was close and prolonged contact between people who had infection and people who did not have infection, so for example other patients, visitors, healthcare workers in emergency rooms, so under crowded conditions and for prolonged periods of time," Dr. Keiji Fukuda, an assistant director general at the WHO, said. "And then we also saw that there were similar mixing of infected and uninfected patients in multi-bed hospital rooms, so where patients are kept. And so these kinds of things made it easier for the virus to hop from an infected person to an uninfected person."

Fukuda added that the virus also spread when patients carried it from hospital to hospital in what he termed "doctor shopping," and also was conveyed to uninfected family members who were in hospitals to bring treats and keep patients company.

But the biggest mistake, he said, was a simple one: South Korea did not expect MERS to arrive.

"There was a lack of awareness about MERS both among health providers and also the general public in the Republic of Korea before the MERS outbreak occurred there, so it really took everybody by surprise," Fukuda said in the press conference. "This probably contributed somewhat to a delay in knowing what was going on."

In that observation, he encapsulated one of the most stubborn and enduring vulnerabilities to diseases: forgetting that they cross borders. It's a lesson that we used to know; the word "quarantine" originates in the "quarantina giorni," 40 days, during which 14th-century Venice forced ships to hold position at sea so outbreaks on board could burn themselves out. Paradoxically, though, awareness that diseases can travel rapidly across the globe has dropped as the speed and ease of travel have risen.

And, thus -- in just a few examples -- SARS, a viral relative of MERS, circled the globe in a week in 2003. Malaria traveled to Washington, DC via mosquitoes that wandered into an aircraft's cargo compartment. H5N1 avian flu sneaked over the border between China and Vietnam in smuggled chickens. The multi-drug resistance factor NDM-1, which renders common infections almost untreatable, went to multiple countries in the guts of medical tourists. And just last year, Ebola walked back and forth across West African borders, transported by guests at a funeral.

An epidemiologist would say that it is inevitable we identify outbreaks retrospectively: We don't detect Patient Zero until there is a Patient One, or 10, or 125. And that would be correct. But it's vital to remember that, if we paid attention, we might have a better chance of stopping outbreaks at low numbers. The most important defense against the spread of disease isn't quarantine, or high technology, or even good health care practice. It's awareness that the possibility of importation is always present. And that can never be allowed to lapse.

[This is an excellent overview reminding us that we live in a global village, and microorganisms do not need visas to cross borders. The key challenge is how do we get healthcare practitioners and the general population to understand that "awareness that the possibility of importation is always present" is crucial to controlling infectious diseases. - Mod.MPP]
