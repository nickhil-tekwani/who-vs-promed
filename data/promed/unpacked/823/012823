Nodding disease update: Uganda Government considering spraying
-------------------------------------------------------------
Government [Uganda] is considering using helicopters to spray areas affected bythe nodding disease, the minister of Health, Dr Catherine Ondoa, has said.

Ondoa also told journalists during a press briefing yesterday that her ministry has dispatched a team of doctors and researchers to northern Uganda to tackle the syndrome that is killing children in droves in Kitgum, Pader and Lamwo districts. Families in these districts have been forced to watch their children present with nodding, seizures, malnutrition and disability. Often, these symptoms have culminated in death.

World health bodies like the World Health Organisation and Centres for Disease Control and Prevention have researched but failed to find the exact cause and cure of Nodding Disease Syndrome. Dr Ondoa told journalists that government trained and dispatched some 99 health workers to Pader, Kitgum and Lamwo to manage the estimated 3000 or so cases.

"This syndrome involves a multitude of problems and we are managing it in a multi-sector way. We are giving patients anti-epileptic drugs as well as vitamins because most of the children suffer from vitamin deficiency," Dr Ondoa said.

She added that 3 specialised screening centres have been opened up in Katanga Health Centre III at Kitgum general hospital and Para Bekan specifically to handle Nodding Disease. Patients who go to these health facilities undergo physical checkups, blood tests, and brain and heart scans. They receive medical treatment as well as psychological and occupational therapy.

"Nodding Disease right now is being handled as a medical, nutritional, psychiatric, behavioural and cognitive disorder," Dr Anthony Mbonye, the Commissioner Health Services, told journalists at the media briefing. Mbonye added that government is also planning outreach programmes for patients who are unable to [get] to the health centres.

Researchers who have been deployed will carry out environmental and ecological
studies in Pader, the worst hit district. Dr Ondoa noted that since the disease is associated with river blindness (onchocerciasis), government has decided to give preventative medicine to the people in the areas affected by that ailment.

Every 6 months, government will give people medication to kill off the microfilariae in their bodies and cut the cycle of spreading the disease from one infected person to another, she said. Government also plans to spray the affected areas using helicopters to kill off the blackflies [_Simulium_ sp.]that pass on the disease from person to person.

"We urge communities to swallow the medicine and cooperate with us during the spraying so that we prevent the cycle," Dr Ondoa said.

[ProMED reviewed the literature on Nodding Disease, ND, in our post of 15 Dec 2011 (see below). The decision to start aerial spraying and 6-monthly drug administration [with ivermectin we suppose] imply that the Government of Uganda has decided that onchocerciasis is a likely cause of the disease. ProMED will be happy to post further information as it becomes available.
