ATLANTIC CITY, NJ: State wildlife officials said yesterday about 310
Atlantic brant died since last weekend from a mysterious illness that also
killed 700 geese in November [2000. The infected geese have been found in
southern Ocean County and along the shoreline of Atlantic and Cape May
Counties. The results of tests done this week are due in a few weeks.

[ProMED-mail posted information on the goose die-off at the end of last
year when the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife issued an alert for
hunters to avoid Atlantic brant until the source of infection was
identified. Checking the website for the New Jersey Div. of Fish and
Wildlife <http://www.state.nj.us/dep/fgw/> no follow-up on the cause of the
die-off back in November was identified. If there is anyone with
additional information on this, ProMED-mail would be interested in learning
the etiologic agent for this die-off. As an aside, the hunting season for
Atlantic brant ended on 9 Jan 2001. - Mod.MPP
