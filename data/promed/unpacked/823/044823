German newspaper Bild found that the US military used deadly anthrax spores in chemical weapons defense training on a military base in Germany. In an article with the headline "US Army operated biological weapons in Germany," Berlin daily Bild revealed that the US military used deadly live anthrax spores in military exercises.

The investigation revealed that several of the US military exercises on German soil involved "incidents" in which live anthrax spores were released. The incidents took place in the town of Landstuhl, near France, Luxembourg and the Ramstein military base. The US military previously sent live anthrax spores to South Korea.

The German defense ministry told the newspaper that the spores were not sent to any German military laboratories. The US military previously admitted that since 2005 it sent anthrax spores to South Korea, Australia and Canada, but not Germany. "According to current information, Bundeswehr servicemen were not put in danger," the German defense ministry claimed in an inquiry to Bild.

The spores were supposed to be neutralized at the Dugway Proving Ground in the US state of Utah before being sent to the exercises, but the incident made "some spores even more active," according to the newspaper.

The Department of Defense admitted in a release quietly published on their website on Monday [27 Jul 2015] evening that 106 labs on top of the already known 86 had received samples of the deadly bacteria since 2003, bringing the total to 192. Their investigation now includes 7 countries -- including Japan, United Kingdom, Korea, Australia, Canada, Italy and Germany -- all 50 states, 3 territories and Washington D.C.

No illnesses have been reported, although 31 Americans -- including 8 who work for the military -- have recently taken medication as a precaution.

Last week, Pentagon officials released a report detailing recurring problems at an Army bioterror facility that accidentally sent anthrax to the other labs for more than a decade. At a press briefing in Washington, military officials said half the lots of anthrax produced at the Army's Dugway Proving Ground in Utah contained live anthrax after workers there failed to kill the bacteria before shipping it to other labs.

"By any measure, this was a massive institutional failure" involving a potentially dangerous biotoxin, said Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work. He presented the results of an investigation that was launched after the problem 1st surfaced in May 2015. Officials said several problems contributed to the Dugway failures.

The Pentagon has ordered the Secretary of the Army to do an additional investigation that will specifically try to determine which individuals are to blame, Work said. Dugway officials should have recognized and corrected the problem, he said. "We are shocked by these failures," he added. "It was absolutely inexcusable."

Dugways's new commander, Col. Sean Kirshner, declined comment, saying he needed time to review the report, said base spokeswoman Sheryl Grubb.

Dugway works with biological and chemical agents and is the military facility that produces the largest amount of anthrax shipped to other labs for research. Medical technicians are supposed to kill the anthrax bacteria with gamma rays and then test samples from the lots to make sure the radiation succeeded in killing them. Investigators believe they were trying to kill too much at a time and then doing inadequate testing afterward. The problem came to light in May 2015 when a private commercial lab in Maryland tested a shipment from Dugway and found live bacteria.
