One person has died and 87 cases of salmonellosis have been linked to 3
brands of contaminated cheese in Quebec, provincial health authorities said
on Friday [29 Aug 2008] in announcing a recall.

The raft of cases occurred in 3 areas: Chaudiere-Appalaches,
Estrie-Mauricie, and Centre-du-Quebec, Dr Horacio Arruda, the province's
director of public health, told a news conference in Montreal. The areas,
which are in zones south of Quebec City, the Eastern Townships, and central
Quebec, experienced an unusually high incidence of cases in recent weeks.
Quebec normally sees 1000 cases of salmonellosis province-wide every year.

The death was an elderly person in Chaudiere-Appalaches, Arruda said. About
40 per cent of the people infected had to be treated in hospital for at
least a day to be rehydrated or for other symptoms, Arruda said. More cases
are expected to occur in the 3 regions.

The Quebec Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, in co-operation
with Fromages la Chaudiere of Lac-Megantic, warned consumers not to eat any
of the non-refined hard cheeses called La Chaudiere, Polo, and Tradition
because they might contain _Salmonella_ Enteritidis bacteria. Products
produced between 24 Jul 2008 and 24 Aug 2008 have been recalled.

At the beginning of the investigation, anecdotal information and
questionnaires pointed to cheese being involved in the outbreak, Arruda
said. "We immediately ordered a special study of the patients as well as
other individuals in the region who could have eaten the same food in order
to identify the cause," Arruda said in French. "We found a similar genetic
print in many of these cases."
