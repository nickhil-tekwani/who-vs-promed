The government of the local collective announced 2 new [fatal] victims recently in French Polynesia in the past week. They are an 80-year-old man with renal insufficiency and an 8-day-old neonate. These 2 new fatalities bring to 4 the number of deaths due to chikungunya [virus infections] in French Polynesia. According to figures from the Health Department, this would be exactly 11 229 people affected by the virus.

Nearly 95 per cent of those infected live in Tahiti and Moorea and 141 hospitalizations have been recorded to date. Cases have also been reported on the Austral islands, the Marquesas and Tuamotu.

Spraying campaigns continue in Polynesia to counter the spread of chikungunya [virus]. "Spraying will resume on Wed 26 Nov [2014], in the urban area and the peninsula," wrote Polynesie 1ere on its website.

[The chikungunya virus outbreak in French Polynesia is increasing rapidly. Since the detection of the 1st cases on 10 Oct 2014, the virus has spread to several islands in French Polynesia, and the case number has now climbed from an estimated 5000 with 2 deaths on 19 Nov 2014 to 11 229, with 4 deaths. In the absence of a commercially available vaccine, vector control is the only preventive measure available, which is the reason for the spraying campaign. Health authorities and the general public need to engage in a collaborative effort to eliminate vector mosquito breeding sites.
