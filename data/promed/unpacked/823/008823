Biologists expect insect-transmitted virus
------------------------------------------
Over the past 2 months, residents of northern Livingston County have
found a lot of dead deer near lakes and rivers. The Department of
Natural Resources (DNR) has started an investigation.

Just 2 months ago, Jino Dinello of Tyrone Township found a young doe
dead in his front yard. "There was no trauma to her, no broken legs,
no blood. It looked like it went to sleep and didn't wake up."

Others around Hoisington Lake were also finding dead deer. Tim Hart
says he knows a woman who found one near her home. "She had a 6-point
laying 6 feet from her back porch, by her bird feeder."

"We have found about 4 bucks and 3 dead does along creeks and ponds,"
echoed Desi Mayner. A DNR biologist came out to look at some of the
carcasses. He suspected epizootic hemorrhagic disease, also known as
EHD.

"It's a virus-caused disease that affects the vascular system. We
wind up with a lot of hemorrhaging occurring," DNR biologist Tom
Cooley said.

Many of the carcasses have been found next to lakes and streams.
That's one reason why biologists think this may be EHD. "We had it in
2006 in the southwest part of the state. Last year we had it in
Oakland and Macomb Counties," Cooley said.

EHD can make deer very thirsty just before they die. Usually it will
kill 50 to 100 in a specific area during the summer months. It's
caused by an insect bite.

"It's a biting midge. It's a very small insect and it will carry the
virus to the deer," explained Cooley. Cooley will take tissue samples
to the DNR lab in East Lansing. He says the disease doesn't affect
people and cooler weather will kill the biting midge, putting a stop
to the disease for this year.

[Much of the East and Midwest of the United States have received an
abundance of rain this year (2009). That abundance of water has led
to breeding pools of mosquitoes, which may promote diseases such as
Eastern Equine Encephalitis, and allow for other insect-borne
diseases such as EHD to flourish.

While it is moving toward autumn in the more northern states such as
Michigan, those states are likely several weeks away from a killing
frost, which will diminish the _Culicoides_ spp, insects that
transmit the disease.

EHD is closely related to the bluetongue virus, but there are some
differences on the molecular level. However, the disease presentation
in the animals can closely resemble each other. In 2007, there were
states that EHD spilled over into cattle. This has not occurred, yet,
this year.

EHD in cattle must be differentiated from foot and mouth disease.
Please see ProMED-mail post 20071122.3786 for more details.

Affected cervids seem to seek water, and are most frequently simply
found dead with no apparent cause for death.
