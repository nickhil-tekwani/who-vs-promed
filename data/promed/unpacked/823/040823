Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis, Iceland
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 10 Oct 2012 from Mr Halldor Runolfsson, chief veterinary officer, Ministry of Agriculture, Agricultural Authority of Iceland, Selfoss, Iceland

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 4 Jul 2012
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 5 Oct 2012
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Bovine herpesvirus 1
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak Location: Nord Ur-Mula (Egilsstadir) [Eastland]
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 275 / 33 / 0 / 0 / 1

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: the infection was detected in a bulk tank sample taken according to the national screening programme for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis. No clinical signs have been observed and so far there is no indication of spread. Epidemiological investigation is ongoing, including collection of bulk tank samples from all dairy herds in the country. Further investigation of the infected herd is also in progress. Samples have been taken for analysis by PCR. There is no export of live cattle or semen from Iceland. Live cattle have never been imported and cattle semen has not been imported since 1987. Last import of fertile embryos was in 1995.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; screening; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals;
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: DTU-Vet, National Veterinary Institute, Lindholm (Denmark) (national laboratory)
Tests and results
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / antibody detection ELISA / 5 Oct 2012 / Positive
Cattle / virus neutralisation test (VNT)/ 8 Oct 2012 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IBR/IPV), caused by bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), is an OIE-listed disease of domestic and wild cattle. The virus is distributed worldwide, but has been eradicated from Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Italy (Province of Bolzano), Switzerland, Norway, and parts of Germany (the 'Oberfranken' and 'Oberpfalz' districts of Bavaria). Control programmes are running in several other countries, for example in Germany and Italy.

The disease is characterised by clinical signs of the upper respiratory tract, such as a (muco)purulent nasal discharge, hyperaemia of the muzzle (red nose disease), and by conjunctivitis. Signs of general illness are fever, depression, inappetence, abortions, and reduced milk yield. The virus can also infect the genital tract and cause pustular vulvovaginitis and balanoposthitis. Post-mortem examinations reveal rhinitis, laryngitis, and tracheitis. Mortality is low, and most infections run a subclinical course. Secondary bacterial infections can lead to more severe respiratory disease, and BoHV-1 could play a role in multifactor diseases such as "shipping fever".

Additional background is available in chapter 2.4.13 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals 2012, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.13_IBR_IPV.pdf.

The exceptionally severe measures undertaken by Iceland to prevent exposing its animal population to exotic pathogens is partly explained by the past experience when introduced disease agents, even ones which are generally not regarded elsewhere as of high pathogenicity and spreading capacity, caused immense damage to the endemic Icelandic livestock. This, due to its high susceptibility and to its husbandry (long housing periods every year). A known example was Johne's disease (paratuberculosis), which, when brought to Iceland in 1933 by the import of infected sheep from Germany, spread rapidly throughout the main sheep breeding areas.

Results of the current epidemiological investigations are anticipated. - Mod.AS
