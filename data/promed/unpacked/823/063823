EBOLAVIRUS-LIKE FILOVIRUS - SPAIN (02): (ASTURIAS), BAT

Worth noting is that many species of bats are migratory, and some fly
for very long distances. The species in question, the Bent-winged bat
[_Miniopterus schreibersii_], does migrate across open sea (for
example, a recapture of a bat in southern Spain that was released in
the Balearic Islands). Some species of bat migrate regularly from the
southern United States and southern Mexico.

A die-off in southern Europe could signal the introduction of an
exotic virus, much as occurred with West Nile virus in the New World.

[ProMED-mail thanks Paul Reiter for this very relevant comment.

The Balearic Islands are an archipelago of Spanish islands in the
western Mediterranean Sea, near the eastern coast of the Iberian
Peninsula. The principal Balearic Islands are Majorca, Minorca, Ibiza,
and Formentera. The Balearic Islands can be located in the
