Health authorities confirmed last Wednesday [12 Feb 2014] that a young 29-year-old woman who was hospitalized in Herrera province and later taken to Panama city for specialized medical attention, is infected with [a] hantavirus but also has dengue.

The woman was 7 months pregnant and because of these infections lost her baby, but is currently in stable condition.

It is worth noting that to date there are 9 reported cases of hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome/HPS] in the Azuero region.

[This unfortunate woman happens to live in an area where both dengue and hantaviruses are endemic. Although the probability of an individual having dual hantavirus and dengue virus infections is fairly remote, it did occur in the case of the patient above. The number of cases of hantavirus infections in the Azuero Peninsula (Herrera, Los Santos, and Veraguas provinces) of Panama, has increased from 2 reported on 19 Jan 2014 in Herrera and Los Santos provinces (see ProMED-mail archive no 20140121.2220063) to the 9 reported on 7 Feb 2014. The Azuero Peninsula is where the majority of the HPS (hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) cases in Panama have been found.

Although the hantavirus involved in these cases is not specified, the one most likely responsible is Choclo virus. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20130204.1527935, of the 3 hantaviruses known to occur in Panama, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing HPS, which can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to hospital late in the course of their disease.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
