A total of 31 people have been diagnosed with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in Iran, the country's health ministry has said in a statement.

The disease has caused the death of 3 people so far in the country. One of them was a pregnant woman. However, an examination will be conducted to find out what actually caused the woman to die, APA's Tehran bureau reported.

The rector of the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences said that another person diagnosed with this type of fever had to come to Shiraz but died before arriving. An examination is underway to find the cause of the death.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread tick-borne viral disease that is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia. Onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, myalgia, (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light). There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. After 2 to 4 days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement).

Iran's Health Ministry has recommended cattle-breeders use preventive means, such as gloves, boots, etc.

[The presence of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) in Iran was 1st identified in studies of livestock sera and ticks in the 1970s, but the 1st human infection was not diagnosed until 1999. Since that time, the number of cases of CCHF in Iran has markedly increased. Through January 2012, a total of 870 confirmed cases have been reported in published literature, with 126 deaths and a case fatality rate (CFR) of 17.6 percent. The disease has been seen in 26 of the country's 31 provinces, with the greatest number of cases in Sistan and Baluchestan, Isfahan, Fars, Tehran, Khorasan, and Khuzestan provinces [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4260932/].

Because CCHF has been reported in most of Iran's neighboring countries, the control of imported livestock may play an important role in reducing disease incidence [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20006541/]. Improved public awareness regarding the methods of disease transmission and preventive measures for the high risk groups can help reduce the number of cases. - Mod.UBA
