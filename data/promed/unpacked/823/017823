Health warning issued on deadly skin disease
The Health and Welfare Ministry issued a health warning yesterday in the
wake of the discovery of oysters carrying _Vibrio vulnificus_ septicemia, a
deadly disease which causes severe skin decay.
Ministry officials said the bacterium was uncovered in oysters and other
shellfish collected in coastal regions of South Cholla Province last
Saturday, this year's first harvest of such seafoods.
_Vibrio vulnificus_ infections generally occur between July and October
among residents in coastal areas. When infected, patients show symptoms
such as high fever, stomachache, vomiting and diarrhea. In 40 to 50 percent
of cases, the infection leads to death. Those who suffer from diabetes,
alcohol addiction, or chronic illnesses of the liver, stomach or kidney are
in the highest-risk group, the ministry said.
To guard against contracting the disease, officials advised that people eat
only seafood that has been fully cooked, avoid consumption of raw fish and
oysters, and if they have open wounds, to refrain from swimming and
cleaning fish.
In 1998, health authorities reported 50 cases of _Vibrio vulnificus_
septicemia, a figure which declined to 27 last year.
