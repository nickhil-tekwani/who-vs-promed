The mystery disease that has triggered panic in remote Gumda VDC
[village development committee area] for the past 2 weeks has been
identified. Health Minister Giriraj Mani Pokhrel arrived here on
Thursday [7 May 2009] along with a team of officials. He announced
that post-viral pneumonia led to the deaths of 13 villagers.

Dr Gunaraj Lohani, chief district health and medical superintendent,
said that so far, around 100 patients had been treated for the
outbreak. A majority of the patients are children.

Gumda VDC is located around 75 km from district headquarters. The
disease is spreading to adjoining Uhiya VDC as well.

[The above newswire report was sent to us in response to the earlier
posting on an outbreak of undiagnosed illness with hemorrhagic
manifestations reported in Rolpa district in Nepal. From the
description of the above described outbreak in Ghorka district (which
is in the Western Region of Nepal, whereas Rolpa district is in the
mid-western region of Nepal <http://ncthakur.itgo.com/map04.htm>),
these do not appear to be related.

The mention of "post viral pneumonia" could refer to primary viral
pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia following a viral
syndrome. Clarification of this diagnosis would be
appreciated. Given the heightened awareness of respiratory illnesses
worldwide and concerns for continued spread of novel influenza
strains, more information on the outbreak in Ghorka district with
laboratory results, if available, would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
