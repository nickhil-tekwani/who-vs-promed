[The death toll from encephalitis in eastern Uttar Pradesh has increased from 358 for this year (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20131009.1992629) reported on 9 Oct 2013 to 479 in the above report some 3 weeks later. As with previous reports of viral encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh state, there is no indication of the proportion of these cases due to Japanese encephalitis virus infections or to other, undetermined causes. Dr. Lloyd Olson noted that is important to remember that not all acute central nervous syndromes in children are inflammatory or infectious (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20131011.1995836). In his comment, he indicated that the histopathologic features from autopsies conducted on 40 children in Udorn, northeastern Thailand, reported in the Amer J Clin Path 1971; 56: 558-71, were characterized by those findings as associated with acute Reye syndrome. This report also details the evidence pointing to acute aflatoxin poisoning as the etiology of the condition in Udorn. The reports from Uttar Predesh provide no information about the similarity of cases and autopsy findings in India compared to those reported from Thailand. ProMED would be interested in the results of such a comparison.
