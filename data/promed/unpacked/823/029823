Product recalls appear to be a case conceptually quite similar to
culling and/or extended movement/trade restriction of animals to
contain serious disease outbreaks: without a very effective "loss
restitution/compensation" arrangement, they are likely to be rather
ineffective, because it is always somewhat difficult to get
individuals or businesses to voluntarily sacrifice goods that they
have already invested heavily to obtain, and then there are always
the unscrupulous few who will endeavor to take advantage of the
recall and/or the somewhat valueless recalled product. Without good
compensation arrangements, it can be extremely difficult to establish
the whereabouts of recalled product, let alone getting it recalled.

For some businesses, there is insurance to address this issue (at
ever increasing costs, particularly as product recalls become more
common), which are inevitably passed on to consumers. In some
developed countries there are also considerable bodies of law to
reinforce the need for commercially-oriented businesses to invest in
this type of insurance. Where such laws exist and insurance is a
virtually compulsory requirement and safeguard for business,
consumers are usually also quite well protected because they receive
refunds or replacement with like-kind, safe product if they respond
to a recall and surrender goods at place of purchase or designated
agencies, not so in most places where laws and insurance or loss
restitution/compensation schemes do not exist for recalls, as in any
of the developing and least developed countries.

In the case of culling and/or extended movement/trade restrictions of
animals for disease containment/control, however, insurance is not so
readily available, and government (with or without industry) backed
compensation schemes are virtually essential. Without the latter,
there is usually great reluctance by owners and producers to report
illness in animals and then to accept culling (of healthy in contact
and/or diseased stock) or other trade-related restrictions, including
where they are by far the most cost-effective available option to
control the disease in question and/or when the disease in question
is a direct zoonotic threat to themselves and the public at large.

Sometimes where compensation exists, it only extends to the stock
losses and often not to a variety of indirect or extended losses,
including trade-related losses, and culled animals are also often not
so readily replaceable as factory-made consumer goods, especially in
the developing world, where trade is much more hand-to-mouth for
large proportions of the population.
