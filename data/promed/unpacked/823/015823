South African scientists believe they have made a major breakthrough in the
long battle against African Swine Fever with a Mozambique-based programme
to develop pigs' resistant to ASFv. The scientists say a herd of such pigs
could be used as breeding stock which in time could replace the thousands
of herds across Africa decimated by the disease. The virus has for decades
ravaged herds of domestic pigs, and scientists have likened its devastating
effect to AIDS. Highly contagious, the virus kills over 95% of the domestic
pigs infected with catastrophic economic consequences.
According to Pretoria-based Agricultural Research Council, an outbreak cost
an estimated $4.5-million in an epidemic in Cameroon in 1982-83, with
farmers compensated by the state. An eradication campaign in Cote d'Ivoire
cost more than $11-million, and farmers were compensated at only one-third
of the market price. In Benin, in 1997-98, pig producers lost more than
$6-million. Having searched in vain for an effective vaccine for 40 years,
scientists now believe the most viable solution is to exploit the genetic
resistance found in certain African domestic pigs, and breed lines
resistant to ASF.
A herd of 25 such pigs will shortly be shipped from the Mozambican research
centre to Pretoria. There, they will be selectively bred in order to obtain
a stable line of pigs with a high degree of resistance to ASF. South
Africa's Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute's Dr. Mary-Louise Penrith's
team intends to find a genetic marker for resistance to ASF and use that
marker to identify pigs for inclusion in future large-scale selective
breeding programmes. Penrith's team intends to find a genetic marker for
resistance to ASF and use that marker to identify pigs for inclusion in
future large-scale selective breeding programmes. New technical advances,
which allow for the mapping of individual pig chromosomes through a
so-called pig genome map, will help scientists screen resistant pigs for
breeding.
The research -- led by South Africa's Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute
along with the ARC -- will involve the collaboration of a variety of
scientific disciplines including virologists, molecular geneticists and pig
breeding specialists in South Africa, Europe and the United States.

[Doubting the veracity of the above as it read like too many Press
Releases, I asked Bob Swanspoel's help in contacting Dr. Mary-Lou Penrith.
Within hours I had the following response, for which I thank both Bob &
Mary-Lou. - Mod.MHJ]

Prof. Swanepoel forwarded your query to me. The answer is quite simply:
We consider that the Mozambique pigs could lead to a major breakthrough in
the development of resistant pigs (needless to say the press has to inflate
things a little! - their prerogative). However, being able to select pigs
from an area where serological testing in July this year revealed that 15%
of 54 pigs sampled were seropositive to African swine fever, but that in
one village 60% of the pigs, including all 7 adults sampled were
seropositive, was very exciting and certainly constitutes a preliminary
breakthrough. The high level of antibodies in pigs in that area supported a
hypothesis, developed after similar serological results were published for
districts across the border in Malawi, by Janet Haresnape and her
co-workers, that at least some areas where ASF is endemic might contain pig
populations with a high level of resistance to ASF. We believe that this
resistance is probably genetic and the result of a length period of
exposure to circulating virus and natural selection.
The next step, of course, before any major breakthrough can be claimed,
will be to find a genetic marker for resistance to ASF. A meeting is
scheduled in Rome in mid-January 1999 between geneticists from various
centres in Europe and USA to coordinate this side of the research.
Like any research project, the outcome is not assured. However, after many
years of hoping to find a way to initiate this project, and after
witnessing the devastation that African swine fever has recently caused in
many African countries, we are encouraged to have some promising pigs to
start with, and are cautiously optimistic for the future of the project.
