Claudia Montenegro, Head of Epidemiology of the Departmental Health Services of Tarija (SEDES), reported on 18 Jun [2015] that so far in 2015, 8 cases of hantavirus infections have been reported with 1 death due to this disease, which is transmitted by rodents.

Montenegro added that these cases of hantavirus infection were identified in Bermejo and Padcaya municipalities. "But we are also on alert in Yacuiba, Carapari y Villa Montes municipalities," the SEDES official added. During this work day in San Lorenzo, a municipality of Tarija, a workshop about this problem is developed in which there is participation by professionals of the health services from throughout the country.

[The number of cases of hantavirus infection in Tarija department have increased from 6 on 9 Mar 2015 to 8 on 18 Jun 2015. The previously reported 2015 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) that occurred in Tarija department were confirmed in Oruro department. Earlier cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been reported from tropical, lowland areas of Bolivia, including 7 cases in Tarija during 2014. The specific hantaviruses involved in these or previous cases for the last 2 years (2013, 2014) in Bolivia are not given.

In the lowland Amazon Basin of Bolivia, the possible hantavirus, its rodent hosts that might be involved in these hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases, with their images, include:
- Laguna Negra virus (_Calomys laucha_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/images/Calomys%20laucha%20enciso%2031aug2011.jpg and _C. callosus_ https://eee.uci.edu/clients/bjbecker/PlaguesandPeople/Calomyscallosusb.jpg);
- Bermejo (Chaco rice rat _Oligoryzomys chacoensis_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/oligorizomyschacoensis.html);
- Oran (_O. longicaudatus_ http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1203.jpeg).

Since some of these cases occurred in the Bermejo municipality, perhaps Bermejo virus was responsible for at least some of these cases of HPS.
