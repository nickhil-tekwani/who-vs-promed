CDC is collaborating with public health officials in several states and the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Montevideo and _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Mbandaka infections. Results from this ongoing investigation indicate that tahini sesame paste distributed by Krinos Foods, LLC of Long Island City, NY is the likely source of this outbreak. [Tahini is a paste made from ground, hulled sesame seeds used in North African, Greek, Turkish and Middle Eastern cuisine. (Wikipedia) - Mod,JW].

Public health investigators are using DNA "fingerprints" of bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. They are using data from PulseNet, the national subtyping network made up of state and local public health laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories that performs molecular surveillance of foodborne infections. These strains of _S._ Montevideo and _S._ Mbandaka have very rarely been seen before in PulseNet. Before this outbreak, these strains had been reported only 29 and 4 times, respectively.

A total of 8 ill persons infected with the outbreak strains of _S._ Montevideo (2 persons) or _S._ Mbandaka (6 persons) have been reported from 6 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: California (1), Minnesota (2), New York (1), North Dakota (1), Texas (2), and Wisconsin (1). Among persons for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from 4 Mar 2013 to 30 Apr 2013. Ill persons range in age from less than one year to 75 years, with a median age of 24 years. 50 percent of ill persons are female. Among 4 ill persons with available information, none reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the Outbreak
-----------------------------
During routine product testing at a retail store, the Michigan Department of Agriculture isolated _S._ Montevideo from Krinos brand tahini sesame paste. Additional testing by the FDA isolated _S._ Mbandaka from imported tahini sesame paste collected from shipments arriving in the USA for distribution by Krinos Foods.

On 28 Apr 2013, Krinos Foods, LLC of Long Island City, NY, recalled its tahini sesame paste. On 9 May 2013, Krinos Foods expanded its recall to include additional expiration dates. The recalled lots have expiration dates from 1 Jan 2014 to 8 Jun 2014 and from 16 Oct 2014 to 15 Mar 2015.

A search of the PulseNet database identified ill persons with the same strains of _S._ Montevideo and _S._ Mbandaka. In interviews, ill persons answered questions about foods eaten and other exposures during the week before becoming ill. Four (100 percent) of 4 ill persons interviewed (2 infected with _S._ Montevideo and 2 with _S._ Mbandaka) reported eating homemade hummus made with Krinos brand tahini sesame paste.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview ill persons about foods eaten before becoming ill. FDA is continuing to work closely with CDC and state partners in this investigation.
