Salmon roe recalled in Canada for possible botulism
---------------------------------------------------
Imperial Caviar & Seafood and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency are recalling salmon roe because it may be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_. This bacterium produces a toxin that can be deadly in very small quantities. No illnesses have been reported in connection with the consumption of these products.

The recalled product is Imperial Caviar & Seafood brand Salmon Roe in 3 sizes. The 50 gram size has a UPC number of 1 86866 90024 8 and codes BB/MA 23-AUG-2017 LOT: 23616-03. Another 50 gram size has a UPC number of 1 86866 90024 8 and codes BB/MA 23-AUG-2017 LOT: 23616-04. The 100 gram size has a UPC number of 1 86866 90023 1 and codes 12-FEB-17 04116-02. They were sold in Quebec at the retail level.

If you purchased these products, do not eat them, even if you plan to cook them. Throw them away in a sealed container or take them back to the store where you bought them for a full refund.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
