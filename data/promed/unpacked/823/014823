A total of 6379 people caught the insect-borne chikungunya virus
since the beginning of this year [2009], a senior public health
official said Wednesday [29 Apr 2009]. Doctor Sanphet Ritthiraksa, a
specialist on preventive medicine of the Songkhla Public Health
Office, said the 6379 chikungunya patients were detected from 1
Jan-27 Apr [2009].

Their number breakdowns to 3007 patients in Sabayoi district, 1387
patients in Sadao district, 328 patients in Thepha district, and 314
patients in Nathawee district. [These only add up to 5036. -

He admitted that it was difficult to control the outbreak because of
mosquitoes in rubber plantations and frequent rains in the province.

[It would be of interest to know if the main chikungunya virus vector
in this outbreak is _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_, as the
control strategies would be somewhat different.

Songkhla province (tinh) is located in southern Thailand, adjoining
the Malaysia border. There have been recent cases of chikungunya
virus infection in Kedah state in northern Malaysia (see ProMED-mail
archive no. 20081217.3963) adjoining the Thailand border, so it is
not surprising that there is an outbreak of chikungunya virus
infection across the border in Songkhla province.
