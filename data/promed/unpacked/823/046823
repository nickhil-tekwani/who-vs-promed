Influenza in Previously Vaccinated Children (USA Pacific Northwest)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
We have report of a significant bump in influenza-positive pediatric patients presenting to a major metropolitan hospital in the Pacific NW, USA, over the last 2-3 weeks. Of note, many of these patients were previously vaccinated for influenza at the start of the school year (September 2011).

Differential diagnosis (in order of probability):

1. Waning immunity as the predominant type A influenza circulating is H3N2 in the Pacific NW. Waning immunity over the course of a routine influenza season is an expected phenomenon. Our team forecasted a moderate vaccine drift probability for A/H3N2 this season several months ago.

2. Waning immunity as there are still significant levels of circulating A/H1N1 (2009) in the Pacific NW. We believe this is highly unlikely and forecasted very low probabilities of vaccine drift for A/H1N1.

3. Possible emergence of other type A influenza viruses such as A/H3N2-variant. While we believe this is unlikely, we cannot exclude it. One of the key indicators we have been monitoring is the appearance of influenza in patients who were previously vaccinated.

[Perhaps of relevance to the above is the the Eurosurveillance Weekly influenza surveillance overview -- 5 Apr 2012 (http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/050412-SUR-WISO.pdf) where it was reported that the 2011/12 influenza season started late and has been without any clear geographic progression across Europe. Furthermore, In relation to the situation in the Pacific Northwest described above, it was concluded that there has been a degree of heterogeneity in the antigenicity of the A(H3) viruses this season and an imperfect fit with the A(H3) component in the seasonal vaccine. - Mod.CP
