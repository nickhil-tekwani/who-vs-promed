Suspicious test results indicate chickens may have been infected with
deadly virus at Kibbutz Grofit. Sample tests conducted by the Health
Ministry, the Agriculture Ministry, and the Veterinary Services
revealed that the bird flu virus might have infected the chicken
coops of Kibbutz Grofit in the Arava region in southern Israel.
In light of the alarming results, additional tests were taken, and
the henhouses were quarantined until final results arrive Friday [24
Aug 2007] morning.
Dr Moshe Haimovitch, head of the national Veterinary Services, told
Ynet, "We are currently conducting peripheral tests that are part of
sample tests done in a bid to map the country, in compliance with
international requirements.
"When we receive a suspicious result, we run the test again, this has
happened many times before, and is only being done for safety reasons."
The bird flu epidemic, which broke out in many areas across the world
in recent years, arrived in Israel in March 2006. Millions of hens
were culled following 3 separate outbreaks throughout the month, in
order to stop the epidemic from spreading.

[For the location of Grofit, in the arid, scarcely populated Arava in
southern Israel, click square 19 in the interactive map at
<http://www.eyeonisrael.com/Israel-touring-map.html> (x=525.95; y=213).
It is situated within the Jordan rift valley, a part of the
Afro-Syrian rift, less than 1 km (0.6 mi) from the Jordanian border
and about 22 km (13.7 mi) from the Egyptian one.
Since no clinical disease is mentioned in the newswire, hopefully
this is not a case of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza);
laboratory results are expected very soon. - Mod.AS]
