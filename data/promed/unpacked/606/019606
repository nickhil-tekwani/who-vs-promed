A U.S. Department of Agriculture scientist has developed a new type of
wheat that slows the spread of a disease that costs U.S. farmers hundreds
of millions of dollars each year, the USDA said this week.
According to the USDA, the new cultivar, McVey hard red spring wheat, will
help fight scab, a fungal disease that shrivels kernels of wheat and other
cereal grains and also produces toxins that can make the crops unfit for
human or animal consumption. The disease is mainly found in the U.S.
northern plains.
Scab cost U.S. wheat farmers more than $2.6 billion between 1991 and 1997,
according to USDA estimates. Many growers do not discover infestations of
scab, otherwise known as _Fusarium_ head blight, until they harvest their
wheat and find empty kernels.
The new variety is named after Donald McVey, a plant pathologist at the
USDA Cereal Disease Laboratory in St. Paul, Minn., who developed the new
wheat. The USDA reports that the new cultivar will be available for the
spring 2000 planting season.

[The new wheat cultivar should decrease the amount of scabby wheat, and
thus reduce the amount of vomitoxin-affected grain. The pathogen
synthesizes the toxin (deoxynivalenol [DON during the infective process in
the wheat plant. Depending on the concentration of vomitoxin in the grain,
consumption of affected grain induces gastric disturbances and animals may
refuse to eat such grain. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has
provided information on acceptable levels of vomitoxin in wheat for
consumption by humans, cattle, chickens, swine and other animals. - Mod.DH
