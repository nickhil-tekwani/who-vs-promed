Horses, mules and donkeys in Haryana, Uttarakhand, Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh are facing a serious health risk due to the re-emergence of glanders, a highly contagious disease caused by bacteria which can be transmitted to other animals and humans.

There is no cure for glanders disease as of now. Hence, any horse, mule or donkey that tests positive has to be put down to prevent the disease from spreading.

A worried Union Health Ministry has issued an alert and is also preparing guidelines for the prevention and control of the disease.

The country has around 1.17 million equines, a majority of which play a crucial role in the livelihood of rural societies living in arid, semi-arid and hilly regions, especially in the foothills of the Himalayas. A small population of equines is used by the Army, police, Border Security Force, racing industry, and sports. The alert issued by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) points out that the risk to rearers and people working in a contaminated area is high.

Especially vulnerable are veterinarians, farriers, transport workers, soldiers, farmers, horse handlers and stable hands.

Glanders infects animals via infected feed, water, skin infections, and other infected animals. The disease can affect the skin, lungs or the entire body. Signs may include fever, chills, muscle aches, and chest pain; pneumonia can rapidly develop. Nodules or ulcers may occur in the skin or the nose, eyes, or mouth. Swollen lymph nodes may also be apparent. Infections, involving the mucous membranes in the eyes, nose and respiratory tract will cause increased mucus production from the affected sites.

In India, major glanders outbreaks were reported between 1976 and 1982 from various parts of the country. Later, sporadic cases were reported in 1988, 1990 and 1998. Though India remained free of glanders for 8 years, outbreaks re-emerged during 2006 to 2011. This year [2017], cases have been reported from various northeastern states, said Dr Uday Kakroo, a veterinarian.

Conjunctivitis, weeping, sensitivity to light, swelling of the nose and face, coughing, and headaches are common. Pneumonia and pulmonary abscesses can also occur. The chronic form of glanders involves abscesses within the muscles of the arms and legs or in the spleen or liver.

Lack of awareness among horse and donkey owners and the limited availability of veterinary services are key factors responsible for under-reporting of incidence of the disease. Hence, control of glanders needs strict implementation of ongoing policy comprising education, awareness of owners and veterinarians, and continuous veterinary education programmes, a senior Health Ministry official said.

[India and Brazil are known to lead the list of countries where glanders, a zoonotic, OIE-listed equids disease, is endemic. According to the OIE records, the annual, countrywide numbers of reported glanders outbreaks (in equidae) countrywide were as follows: 2010 - 1; 2011 - 3; 2012 - 1; 2013 - 1; 2014 - 0; 2015 - 5. During the 1st semester of 2016, 9 outbreaks were reported, involving 45 cases, of which 36 died. India's OIE semi-annual report for the period July-December 2016 is not yet available.

No statistics on the incidence of glanders in humans in India could be obtained.

The recent intensified circulation of glanders in India is apparent from the steady increase in the number of glanders cases reported by ProMED-mail since 2014 (see in "see also").

Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form also occurs, known as "farcy." Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of reactors. _B. mallei_ can be transmitted to humans, but such cases, which were known to be often fatal, have become rather uncommon (see ref. 1). In view of its zoonotic potential, all infected or contaminated (or potentially infected or contaminated) material must be handled in a laboratory with appropriate biosafety and biosecurity controls following a bio-risk analysis.

The above and additional information on glanders, its causative agent, and its diagnosis is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.11_GLANDERS.pdf. A useful updated review on the disease, including its recent global distribution, is available in ref. 1.

No vaccine against this disease is available; however, prior use of _B. mallei_ as a biological weapon and its high mortality in inhalation animal studies has affirmed _B. mallei_ as a biodefense concern. This encouraged, in the past, studies addressing the development of a human vaccine (ref. 2).

[Glanders is an infection caused by _Burkholderia mallei_ and occurs primarily in horses and related animals. It is rare in humans. It is unclear what symptoms occurred in the person and how the diagnosis was made. The following appears to be the most recent review of _B. mallei_ infections in humans, including the description of disease manifestations, [which is extracted below]: Van Zandt KE, Greer MT, Gelhaus HC.

"Features of human clinical glanders.
"General symptoms. Many forms of glanders have been described, including chronic, disseminated, pulmonary, and septicemic. The variety of infections is largely explained by various routes of infection. Localized infections are generally regionally confined and typically characterized by foci of suppuration. The abscesses can ulcerate and drain for long periods of time. However, localized infections may disseminate, leading to pulmonary, septicemic, or multi-tissue infection [9]. The most common clinical features of the eight laboratory-acquired infections from Fort Detrick included (in order of most common occurrence) afternoon to evening low-grade fever, malaise, fatigue, headache, myalgias including backache, lymphadenopathy, and chest pain. Approximately half of the patients not only felt better but were also clinically better for a period of time after the first wave of disease symptoms. This period lasted from a few days to 2 months then patients developed clinical signs of infection.

"Mucosal involvement. Involvement of the eye and conjunctiva in a B. mallei infection presents with excessive lacrimation and photophobia. Nasal involvement is characterized by inflammation and swelling of the nose, which is common following inhalation of B. mallei. This may be followed by copious nasal discharge. Additionally, infection may invade the nasal septum and bony tissues, causing fistulae and tissue destruction [9]. The face may swell and regional lymph nodes may become inflamed. Infection may also extend lower in the respiratory tract, resulting in bronchitis which can be accompanied by cough and mucopurulent sputum production. Constitutional signs and symptoms such as fever and chills typically occur within the first few days following infection. Additionally, these symptoms may persist through treatment and be severe. Common signs and symptoms can include, but are not limited to, fever or low-grade fever in the afternoon to evening; chills with or without rigors; and severe headache [9].

"Cutaneous involvement. Cutaneous manifestations include papular lesions that may erupt anywhere on the body with a more chronic, indolent course of infection. B. mallei entry through an abrasion is typically followed by an inflammatory response, including pain and swelling. In these cases, a glanders node may appear as a single blister, gradually developing into an ulcer that may become hemorrhagic [18,35]. A localized infection with a discharge typically develops at the entry site. Inflammation may extend along regional lymphatics and cause lymphangitis with numerous foci of suppuration along their course. The endotoxins present in B. mallei strains affect the smooth muscle of the lymphatics [9] by enhancing the irritation and inflammation seen in the lymphatics.

"Pulmonary involvement. A pulmonary infection typically results in pneumonia, pulmonary abscess, pleuritis, and plural effusion. Signs and symptoms of pulmonary infection can include cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and mucoplurent sputum. Nonspecific signs and symptoms such as fatigue, fever (often exceeding 102Â°F), chills, headache, myalgias, lymphangitis, sore throat, pleuritic chest pain, cough, tachypnea, dyspnea, discharge, and gastrointestinal signs often accompany respiratory infections [9]. Many symptoms may take up to 2 to 3 weeks to develop. Nonspecific signs, such as dizziness, rigors, myalgia, nausea, night sweats, severe headache, tachycardia, weight loss, and mucosal eruptions are also usually present and may indicate a disseminated infection [9].

"Dissemination of infection. Dissemination from local cutaneous or mucosal infection result in septicemia and the colonization of internal organs such as the spleen, liver, and lungs with the development of abscesses [9]. Ultrasonography and computed tomography may reveal multiple, small discrete abscesses in both the liver and the kidney [23]. These infections are typically associated with septic shock and high mortality." - Mod.LL
