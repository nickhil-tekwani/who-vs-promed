One of the biggest threats to cane growers is also one of the least understood. Yellow canopy syndrome appeared at a farm south of Cairns in 2012 and has since spread to farms across north Queensland including Mackay. Canegrowers president Paul Schembri said about $5-6 million had been spent to discover the cause.

Mackay Area Productivity Services' John Agnew said it was widespread, with about 50 per cent [of crops] showing some sign of the syndrome. "This year [2015] has been the worst year for it so far," he said. "It's not in every paddock but it is everywhere. We don't know what it is, that's scary."

One of the main problems with identifying a cause or a solution was because it appeared to have no pattern. "The extent of the outbreak fluctuated," he said. "In severe cases you can end with 30-40 per cent less yield."

[Yellow canopy syndrome (YCS) of sugarcane is only reported from Queensland and does not resemble any known diseases of the crop. It appears to spread southwards, but its means of transmission are unknown. Next to cane fields, similar symptoms have also been observed in grasses, which are therefore suspected as potential disease reservoirs. Transport restrictions on the movement of cane between districts have been introduced in an attempt to limit the spread of YCS, and some cane varieties have been reported to be more susceptible than others.

Research to find a possible cause is ongoing in Australia. So far, herbicides, insects, nutrient deficiency or toxicity, as well as known viral, bacterial or fungal diseases have been largely eliminated from further consideration. YCS can be induced experimentally in healthy plants and an infectious cause is considered likely, but environmental stress has not been ruled out as a potential contributing or triggering factor. Accurate diagnosis of a cause will be essential for providing control strategies.

YCS has started to impact cane productivity in Queensland, but it is difficult to estimate its rate of spread and potential economic impact in the longer term.
