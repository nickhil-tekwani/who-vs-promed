Thirteen members of the Native American Church of Navajoland drank peyote
tea from a communal jar during a religious ceremony. Peyote is a cactus
with hallucinogenic properties; its use is legal in traditional American
Indian ceremonies.
Three of the 13, all men aged 40, 42 & 72, came down with bilateral,
symmetric weakness in all extremities 2-4 days later. In addition, 2 had
speech disturbances and double vision. The peyote was found to contain type
B botulinum toxin by an assay at CDC, Atlanta.
One case was hospitalized and required parenteral nutrition for 14 days.
All recovered in 4-12 weeks. None were treated with antibotulinum toxin,
since that is reserved for people whose condition deteriorates seriously.
The peyote tea was made from cactus buttons ground with alkali and stored
under water in a closed jar for 2 months in the refrigerator. This is not
the traditional way of preparation, and it allowed spores of _Clostridium
botulinum_, which were on the cactus (since they are found in the
environment) to germinate and produce the toxin.

[Foodborne botulism, generally caused by type E botulinum toxin, occurs
with an unusually high incidence among native populations in northern
Canada and Alaska as well. This problem has been recognized for decades,
and is often associated with inappropriate modifications of traditional
fermentation/preservation practices applied to seal, whale, or other meats.
