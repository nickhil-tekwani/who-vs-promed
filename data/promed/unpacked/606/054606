This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Outbreak location 1: Predio Los Dos Hermanos, Acandí, Choco
Started: 4 Oct 2022
Detailed characterization: clade: 2.3.4.4b - lineage: reassortment Eurasian and North American
Epidemiological unit: farm
Animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds (domestic) / 57 / 20 / 6 / 51 / 0 / 0
Blue winged teal (wild) / 2 / 0 / 0 / 2 / 0 / 0

Outbreak location 2: Predio Hermanos Diaz, Acandí, Choco
Started: 2 Oct 2022
Detailed characterization: clade: 2.3.4.4b - lineage: reassortment Eurasian and North American
Epidemiological unit: farm
Animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds (domestic) / 137 / 116 / 80 / 57 / 0 / 0
Blue winged teal (wild) / 3 / 0 / 0 / 3 / 0 / 0

Affected population: the affected population includes non-poultry domestic birds living together with wild birds. Clinical signs were neurological, respiratory, and digestive signs. The premises does not have biosecurity measures in place.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species
Epidemiological comments: after the outbreaks were detected, epidemiological surveillance and control activities were launched. Perifocal, surveillance, and protection zones were established. In the 3 zones, a census of the entire avian population, individual clinical inspection and sampling for active surveillance began in 100% of the farms in order to assess the disease spread. It is currently established that the likely origin of the infection is the contact of non-poultry domestic birds with wild birds (family: Anatidae, species: _Spatula discors_), as well as other migratory and native wild birds that are being monitored for identification. As a control measure, the affected premises, and the municipality of Acandí were quarantined to prevent movement of animals and products to other territories. Stamping out of affected animals and in-contacts on the premises where the disease was detected has begun.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: surveillance outside the restricted zone; surveillance within the restricted zone; traceability; screening; movement control; disinfection; quarantine
Domestic and wild control measures to be applied: stamping out

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Outbreaks / Test / First result date / Last result date / Result
National Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (NVDL) / bird / 1 / real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) / 18 Oct 2022 / 18 Oct 2022 / positive

[On 20 Oct 2022, a media report (https://www.vanguardia.com/economia/nacional/ica-confirma-presencia-de-influenza-aviar-en-colombia-BJ5821276; in Spanish) mentioned that Acandí is a municipality located in the extreme north of the department of Choco, in a border area with Panama that is not connected by land with the rest of the national territory. There are no commercial poultry farms in the region and the municipality's poultry production is exclusively characterized by backyard premises with birds that are raised in a single space and whose products are used exclusively for self-consumption.

The presence of the disease in the country is still being studied by the ICA (Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario), and the 1st hypothesis is the close interaction with migratory wild birds, which are usually healthy carriers of the influenza virus. It is important to clarify that this geographical region is on the migratory route of wild birds that travel from the north of the continent, where, according to WOAH reports, there are active outbreaks of the disease.

At this time, according to the Institute, the contingency plan for avian influenza is active and a team made up of epidemiologists, veterinarians, and livestock technicians has been formed, which has been concentrated in the local office of the ICA in Acandí to control and eradicate the disease. In the backyard premises identified as positive, quarantine measures were established in order to mitigate the risk of spreading the disease to other areas of the department of Chocó or the country.

Please note that any discrepancies in event start, confirmation, and other dates in ProMED posts and the WOAH corresponding reports are the result of a technical problem already being addressed by WOAH. - Mod.CRD
