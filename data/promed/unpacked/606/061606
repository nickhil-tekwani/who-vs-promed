All were negative for avian influenza.

Control measures
Measures applied: control of wildlife reservoirs; stamping out; movement control inside the country; screening; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals.

Measures to be applied: No other measures

[Given the date when this event was reported to have started (22 Apr 2014), there is some degree of confidence in deducing that these 2 outbreaks in Viet Nam might be related to the events which occurred during the beginning of this year [2014] in Laos and China.

The event in Laos started on 13 Mar 2014; see immediate notification at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=15052.

The event in China started on 23 Apr 2014; see immediate notification at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=15200.

Regarding China's report, and according to the epidemiological comment in the final report, http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=15698, "this event was 1st notified in May 2014 as due to low pathogenic avian influenza H5N6 but later confirmed by the OIE Reference Laboratory (Harbin Veterinary Research Institute) as highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N6. The previous immediate notification has been, therefore, amended."
