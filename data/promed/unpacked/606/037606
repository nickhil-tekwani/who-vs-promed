Belgium: avian influenza virus-infected eagles smuggled into Brussels by air
-----------------------------------------------
A Thai man, who tried to smuggle 2 small eagles infected with avian
influenza virus into Belgium, was undergoing medical tests on Sun 24 Oct
2004, but appeared to be in good health, officials said. Authorities
detained the man after a manhunt and took him to a hospital in the northern
port city of Antwerp. "It's precautionary ... he hasn't complained of any
symptoms," Rene Snacken of the Public Health Institute told RTBF television.
The man, whose name was not released, had been detained briefly on Monday
[18 Oct 2004], after authorities discovered the birds hidden in plastic
tubes in his hand luggage, which he had carried on flights from Bangkok via
Vienna. The birds were destroyed, but the man was released. Health
authorities then launched a manhunt, appealing to him to report to police
and saying he was at risk of contracting the virus from his contact with
the birds. It was not immediately clear whether he had handed himself in or
was found by police on Sunday [24 Oct 2004].
Health authorities stressed there was little chance he could have passed
the disease to other people. European and Belgian authorities, however,
urged passengers on the same flight as the birds to contact doctors if they
developed flu symptoms in the next 7 days. The man and his birds flew on
EVA Airways flight BR0061 from Bangkok to Vienna, arriving in the Austrian
capital on 18 Oct 2004, then connected with Austrian Airlines flight OS351
to Brussels. "Although the risk of transmission from animals to humans is
limited, it cannot be excluded, since the birds traveled in the passenger
cabin," an EU statement said. In Vienna, Austrian Airlines spokesman
Johannes Davoras told the Austrian Press Agency that all 128 people on the
Brussels-bound flight would be contacted and asked to undergo a medical
examination.
The crested hawk eagles were destroyed immediately at the quarantined
holding zone of Brussels International Airport. Post-mortem tests showed
they were infected. Thailand is a center of a bird flu outbreak that has
devastated poultry farms in Asia. The disease has killed more than 30
people in Thailand and Viet Nam, and forced the culling of over 100 million
birds across much of Asia.
Belgium and other European Union nations have banned imports of live birds
and bird products from several Asian nations. Smuggling of birds of prey is
common, with collectors willing to pay thousands of euros for live birds,
officials said. Europe had its own outbreak of bird flu last year [2003],
which resulted in the culling of 30 million chickens and other birds in the
Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany.
The EU played down any risk from this week's smuggled eagles. "The birds
never left the quarantine installations on Brussels airport and did not
pose any threat to the European poultry flock," the EU statement said.
Customs and health officials in contact with the birds at Brussels airport
have been given medical checks and anti-viral medicines. In Bangkok, the
Thai Public Health Ministry said the case should not cause great concern
since only poultry, such as chickens, and not wild birds have been known to
transmit bird flu directly to humans. The ministry said it believed the
birds originated from outside Thailand.

Veterinarian in contact with infected eagles shows symptoms of bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
A Thai man, who smuggled infected birds from Bangkok, appears to be free of
disease, but a veterinarian, who put down 2 small eagles smuggled from
Thailand shortly after they were discovered at Brussels airport last week,
is sick in the hospital with symptoms of avian influenza, Belgian officials
revealed late yesterday [Sun 24 Oct 2004].
A wildlife campaigner in Thailand, who spoke to the Belgian authorities
last night [24 Oct 2004], said the news was bad. "It means people here will
now [attempt to destroy] birds of prey," said the wildlife expert, who
preferred not to be named.
The Thai man who tried to smuggle the birds into Belgium was undergoing
medical checks last night [24 Oct 2004], but appeared to be in good health,
local officials said. Authorities feared that the man, who they did not
name, may also have the deadly disease. Freed on bail after being caught
with the eagles at Brussels International Airport, the man was detained
again on Sun 24 Oct 2004 and taken to a hospital in the northern port city
of Antwerp. "It's precautionary ... he hasn't complained of any symptoms,"
Rene Snacken of the Public Health Institute told RTBF television.
Customs authorities discovered the birds hidden in plastic tubes in the
man's hand luggage, which he had carried on flights from Bangkok via
Vienna. Health authorities then launched a manhunt, appealing for the
smuggler to report to police, saying he was at risk of contracting the
virus from his contact with the birds. It was not immediately clear whether
he had handed himself in or was found by police. Doctors stressed there was
little chance he could have passed the disease to other people. European
and Belgian authorities, however, urged passengers on the same flight as
the birds to contact doctors if they develop flu symptoms in the next 7 days.

Avian flu: illegal imports of birds of prey from Asia, possible exposure of
flight passengers
-----------------------------------------------
After the discovery of avian flu H5N1 in 2 illegally imported birds of prey
from Thailand, the Belgian authorities have requested the European
Commission to assist them in their search for flight passengers of
different nationalities who might have been exposed to the flu virus.
Passengers who traveled on 17/18 Oct 2004 from Bangkok to Vienna with EVA
Airways, flight number BR 0061 (arriving in Vienna on 18 Oct 2004 at 5:30),
and passengers who traveled on 18 Oct 2004 from Vienna to Brussels with
Austrian Airlines, flight number OS351 (arriving at 8:50), are advised to
see their doctor if they have any flu-type symptoms (nausea, fever, cold).
Although the risk of transmission from the animals to humans is limited, it
cannot be excluded, since the birds traveled in the passenger cabin in hand
luggage. The European Commission supports the efforts of the Belgian
authorities to identify the passengers in order to limit any risks for
those exposed, but, also, to limit any possible introduction of the avian
flu virus into Europe.
The birds were discovered by the customs authority in Brussels airport on
Mon 18 Oct 2004. The birds never left the quarantine installations on
Brussels airport and did not pose any threat to the European poultry flock.
Avian flu has not been diagnosed anywhere in Europe since the outbreak in Asia.
The test results confirming avian flu in the illegal imports were available
this weekend [23-24 Oct 2004]. After a scientific risk assessment, the
Belgian authorities decided to search for the passengers. Although
passenger lists are available for the 2 flights concerned, address details
of the passengers are not known. All precautions have to be taken to avoid
the importation of the avian flu virus into Europe.

[Illegal trade in animals is known to play a role in the international
spread of infectious animal diseases. For instance, smuggled fighting cocks
from Thailand were found by the Malaysians to be the mode of the H5N1 avian
influenza virus introduction in August 2004.
In January 2004, avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 was detected in Hong
Kong in the carcass of a peregrine falcon, which had been found dead. - Mod.AS]
