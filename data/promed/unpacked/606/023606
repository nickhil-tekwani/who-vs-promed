Here is what I found on PubMed and in our archives:
1. In 1997 a French study isolated salmonellae from 40% of fecal
samples isolated from pet turtles. The most common isolate was
_Salmonella meunchen_.
Reference: Zentralbl Veterinarmed [B 1997 Dec;44(10):625-9.
Isolation and identification of Salmonella species from chelonians
using combined selective media, serotyping and ribotyping. Kodjo
A, Villard L, Prave M, Ray S, Grezel D, Lacheretz A, Bonneau M,
Richard Y. Ecole Nationale Veterinaire de Lyon, Departement
Sante Publique Veterinaire, Marcy l'Etoile, France.
2. A 1987 study of _Salmonella_ contamination of a central
laboratory animal facility determined that day-old chicks
sometimes brought salmonellae with them, and _Salmonella
muenchen_ was one of two serotypes among 6 isolates.
3. A 1997 ProMED-mail posting [see 2nd ref. above reported an
outbreak of _Salmonella muenchen_ food poisoning in Australia.
This one was a contaminated meat product, not fruit juice.
See also:
Food-borne disease outbreaks (worldwide) (02 970901160601
Foodborne diseases review 971001231708
The former cites _S. enteriditis_ and _S. typhimurium_ DT 104 as
the most common isolates in foodborne infections, and the latter
included some data from Steve Berger that more or less confirms
this.
So, I guess this tells us that the organism is around among poultry
and reptilian pets, and there is a ready source for accidental
contamination of food products, but there are more common
isolates from foodborne infections.
