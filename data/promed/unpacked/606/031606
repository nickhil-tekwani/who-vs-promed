Re: Poliomyelitis - update (28): Syria, global, WHO 20131128.2078961

I have been a long-time researcher on polio in India and polio vaccines.

The recent episodes of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) spread in Syria with polio cases and in Israel, West Bank and Gaza Strip without cases have important lessons for us.

1. Unless the source is turned off -- in this case Pakistan (and Nigeria in the Horn of Africa outbreaks), WPV1 can re-infect at unexpected times and places.

2. Re-infection can occur in spite of reasonably good immunisation coverage; the lower the coverage, the higher the probability of spread.

3. If immunised with IPV [inactivated polio vaccine], children are protected from disease, but not from infection and shedding in stools.

4. If immunised with OPV [oral polio vaccine], some children with a few doses may not be protected from polio disease and also there would be spread, widely.

5. Such ease of importation, spread, wide geographic expansion, and the paucity of common-source water-borne and food-borne outbreaks in the past decades, the very young age (from a few months still exclusively breastfeeding) of children with polio paralysis, the virtual saturation of all children with infection -- all these stare at us, almost demanding that we revise our understanding of the mode of transmission. Fecal-oral is the [standard] teaching and the evidence is the huge amounts of virus shed in stool.

6. Poliovirus is shed also in throat secretions for about 2 weeks and sprayed [out]as droplets and aerosol. So, respiratory tract spread via the nose is very likely and will explain the above features. In support is the experience in industrialised countries with good sanitation and hygiene with a lot of polio that could be prevented exclusively with immunisation.

7. In summary, we must consider WPV a respiratory route transmitter whether or not it also transmits fecal-oral.
