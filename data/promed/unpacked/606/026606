As Kyasanur Forest disease, popularly known as monkey fever, has created havoc on Tirthahalli and Hosanagar taluks in the [Shamoga] district this year, people in the affected region have demanded the Government to avoid releasing monkeys captured in urban areas into the forest, and to modernise the Viral Diagnostic Laboratory in the district at the earliest.

The monkey fever is a transmitted through the ticks from monkeys to human beings.

It is said that the monkeys captured in urban areas lack the skills to survive in the forest. Moreover, the resistance power in such monkeys against viral infections was low.

Even after being released in the forest, these monkeys return to these villages in search of food. The people are now demanding that the Government stop releasing these monkeys in the nearby forests.

Meanwhile, the reports of monkey fever are pouring in steadily from Tirthahalli and Hosanagar taluks even after completion of the vaccination drive by the Department of Health and Family Welfare.

The Viral Diagnostic Laboratory (VDL) in the city is receiving blood samples of suspected cases daily. As many as 176 blood samples of suspected cases were subjected to test at VDL in 2012 of which 38 blood samples were tested positive.

Sources in the Department of Health and Family Welfare have said that of the 37 tick samples collected in the district this year so far, 13 tested positive.

As monkey fever has become a regular phenomenon in the district, there is a growing demand to modernise the VDL in the city. At present, mouse inoculation method is used to test the blood samples under which at least seven days is required to get the results. A proposal has been sent to the Government to introduce rapid polymerase based chain reaction testing facility here at an estimated cost of Rs. 75 lakh under which the result of test conducted on blood samples of suspected cases can be known in a span of 24 hours. Training on the new investigation procedure has been provided for very few staff members of VDL.

Meanwhile, a team of experts from the National Institute of Virology, Pune, have visited the VDL recently and assessed the facilities available there to introduce the new investigation procedure.

The team has provided the list of equipment and machines that need to be purchased for the purpose. People in the affected region have demanded that the Government allocate ample funds in the budget for 2012-13 to modernise the VDL.

[The number of KFD [Kyasanur Forest Disease] cases continues to increase over the past month. Apparently, the Shimoga district in Karnataka state is an endemic focus for KFD virus. Translocating monkeys is unlikely to be successful, and runs the risk of moving pathogens to new areas along with animals. Apparently, the animals are not moved to areas unpopulated by people to prevent them from returning to villages. If culling or translocation are unacceptable socially, the only long-term measure to reduce monkey numbers may be sterilization or contraception.

There have been human cases in the Shimoga district in 2011 and 2009. In the 28 Feb 2009 post on KFD in India (ProMED-mail archive number 20090302.0860), Mod.CP posted this excellent comment:

"Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) is caused by Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the family _Flaviviridae_. KFDV was identified in 1957 when it was isolated from a sick monkey from the Kyasanur forest in Karnataka (formerly Mysore) state, India. The main hosts of KFDV are small rodents, but shrews, bats, and monkeys may also carry the virus. KFD is transmitted from the bite of an infected tick (_Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector). Humans can get this disease from a tick bite or by contact with an infected animal, such as a sick or recently dead monkey. Larger animals such as goats, cows, and sheep may become infected with KFD, but they do not have a role in the transmission of the disease. Furthermore, there is no evidence of the disease being transmitted via the unpasteurized milk of any of these animals. It occurs principally in the Shimoga and Kanara district of Karnataka, India and is common in young adults exposed during the dry season in the forest.

After an incubation period of 3-8 days, the symptoms of KFD begin suddenly with fever, headache, severe muscle pain, cough, dehydration, gastrointestinal symptoms and bleeding problems. Patients may experience abnormally low blood pressure and low platelet, red blood cell, and white blood cell counts. After 1-2 weeks of symptoms, some patients recover without complications. However, in most patients, the illness is biphasic, and the patient begins experiencing a 2nd wave of symptoms at the beginning of the 3rd week. These symptoms include fever and signs of encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). The diagnosis is made by virus isolation from blood or by serologic testing using enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assay. There are approximately 400-500 cases of KFD per year with a case fatality rate of 3-5 percent.

Some of this information has been extracted from the CDC fact sheet (see:
http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/KyasanurForestDis.pdf)."

KFD virus and its variants are found in a wider geographic area than just India. A variant of KFD virus, Alkhurma virus, was isolated in Saudi Arabia. The gene sequence of a Nanjianyin China virus isolate obtained from a febrile patient is highly homologous to that of KFD virus. ProMED-mail archive number 20090303.0871 cites Prof. Steve Berger saying, "... 22.4 percent of persons living in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands were found to be seropositive for KFD in 2002," and that "there is a safe and effective inactivated vaccine available in India."
