Puppy parents and canine caregivers, beware: there's an outbreak of the dog flu in Chicago. Although a vaccine is available, it can only be administered if your pup isn't already ill. And steering clear of the illness can prove difficult.

Though there has been some debate about whether we're seeing a flare-up of the flu or bordetella (kennel cough), local veterinarian Dr Natalie Marks of Blum Animal Hospital has confirmed that her facility has seen 5 to 12 cases of canine influenza a day in recent weeks. Citing the illness as "high-risk," Dr Marks warns that it develops "very quickly, [in] 1 to 3 days" and that sick pups will have a cough and present as "very lethargic, [with] high fever, pneumonia."

Dogs at the highest risk for exposure are those that spend time at dog parks or in doggie daycare, but the reality is that any dog that's around other pups is susceptible. Some dogs will only be carriers for the disease, which is what makes dog parks and other group facilities such a daunting prospect, both for patrons and operators. Dr Marks recommends getting your dog a flu vaccination, as the risks are minimal and the benefits substantial.

The disease has not been found to transmit to humans, but we can inadvertently spread it after coming into contact with an infected dog. Although canine influenza is not often fatal, the CDC estimates that 80 percent of dogs infected will develop at least a mild case of the disease. So while you're out stocking up on antihistamines, maybe make an appointment with your vet and help keep Chicago's dogs healthy.

[Dog flu is a contagious respiratory disease in dogs caused by a specific Type A influenza virus referred to as a "canine influenza virus" (CIV). This is a disease of dogs, not of humans.

CIV is an A/H3N8 influenza virus (not a human influenza virus) that was originally an equine (horse) influenza virus. This virus has spread to dogs and can now spread between dogs.

The H3N8 equine influenza virus has been known to exist in horses for more than 40 years. In 2004, however, cases of an unknown respiratory illness in dogs (initially greyhounds) were reported. An investigation showed that this respiratory illness was caused by the equine influenza A/H3N8 virus. Scientists believe that this virus jumped species (from horses to dogs) and has now adapted to cause illness in dogs and spread among dogs housed in kennels and shelters. This is now considered a dog-specific lineage of H3N8. In September of 2005, this virus was identified by experts as "a newly emerging pathogen in the dog population" in the United States.

The signs of this illness in dogs are cough, runny nose, and fever, however, a small proportion of dogs can develop severe disease. The percentage of dogs infected with this disease that die is very small. Some dogs have asymptomatic infections (no signs), while some have severe infections. Severe illness is characterized by the onset of pneumonia. Although this is a relatively new cause of disease in dogs and nearly all dogs are susceptible to infection, about 80 percent of infected dogs will have a mild form of disease.

CIV can be spread to other dogs by direct contact with aerosolized respiratory secretions from infected dogs, by uninfected dogs coming into contact with contaminated objects, and by moving contaminated objects or materials between infected and uninfected dogs. Therefore, dog owners whose dogs are coughing or showing other signs of respiratory disease should not expose other dogs to the virus. Clothing, equipment, surfaces, and hands should be cleaned and disinfected after exposure to dogs showing signs of respiratory disease.

Testing to confirm CIV infection is available. Your veterinarian can tell you if testing is appropriate. The tests can be performed using respiratory secretions collected at the time of disease onset or using two blood samples; the 1st collected while the animal is sick and the second 2 to 3 weeks later.

Treatment largely consists of supportive care. This helps the dog mount an immune response. In the milder form of the disease, this care may include medication to make your dog more comfortable and fluids to ensure that your dog remains well-hydrated. Broad spectrum antibiotics may be prescribed by your veterinarian if a secondary bacterial infection is suspected.

An approved vaccine is available. It is a preventative and must be given before your animal is ill.

To date, there is no evidence of transmission of canine influenza virus from dogs to people and there has not been a single reported case of human infection with the canine influenza virus. While this virus infects dogs and spreads between dogs, there is no evidence that this virus infects humans.

However, human infections with new influenza viruses (against which the human population has little immunity) would be concerning if they occurred. Influenza viruses are constantly changing and it is possible for a virus to change so that it could infect humans and spread easily between humans. Such a virus could represent a pandemic influenza threat. For this reason, CDC and its partners are monitoring the H3N8 influenza virus (as well as other animal influenza viruses) very closely. In general, however, canine influenza viruses are considered to pose a low threat to humans. As mentioned earlier, while these viruses are well established in horse and dog populations, there is no evidence of infection among humans with this virus.

CIV causes a respiratory infection in dogs that is often referred to as canine influenza. CIV has been recognized since 2005 and almost all dogs are susceptible to infection when they are newly exposed because they have not built up natural immunity. Most dogs that develop CIV infection have a mild illness, but some dogs get very sick and require treatment.

Clinical signs associated with CIV can be confused with canine cough, making accurate diagnosis difficult.

There is an effective and safe vaccine for canine influenza fully licensed by the USDA. Nobivac Canine Flu H3N8 has been shown to control the spread and minimize the impact of CIV infection and has been proven safe in half a million dogs.
