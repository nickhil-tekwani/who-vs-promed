At least 20 suspected monkeypox cases have been reported since the beginning of the week in Tshuapa district, Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to a Radio Okapi report.

Sources say that 18 of the suspected cases are hospitalized at a hospital in the town of Ikela. Despite not being laboratory confirmed, the Chief Health officer in the Mbamba health area, Dr. Jean-Pierre Inonga, said they are calling the cases monkeypox based on several telltale symptoms presented: fever, scabs and generalized skin rash.

Confirmation testing is being performed at the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa as of this writing. The resurgence of the viral disease is believed to be due to consumption of game animals found dead in the forest by the public.

Monkeypox is a relatively rare disease caused by the virus with the same name, which is found primarily in central and western Africa. It is closely related to the smallpox virus (variola), the virus used in the smallpox vaccine (vaccinia), and the cowpox virus. Infection with monkeypox is not as serious as its cousin, smallpox; however, human deaths have been attributed to monkeypox.

According to the CDC, the symptoms of monkeypox are as follows: About 12 days after people are infected with the virus, they will get a fever, headache, muscle aches, and backache; their lymph nodes will swell; and they will feel tired. One to 3 days (or longer) after the fever starts, they will get a rash. This rash develops into raised bumps filled with fluid and often starts on the face and spreads, but it can start on other parts of the body too. The bumps go through several stages before they get crusty, scab over, and fall off. The illness usually lasts for 2 to 4 weeks.

Rodents, such as rope squirrels, door mice and pouched rats, are the suspected reservoir hosts, with monkeys and humans as secondary, spill-over hosts.

People at risk for monkeypox are those who get bitten by an infected animal or who have contact with the animal's rash, blood or body fluids. It can also be transmitted person-to-person through respiratory or direct contact and contact with contaminated bedding or clothing.

There is no specific treatment for monkeypox.

[This area in the DRC is endemic for monkeypox virus, and sporadic human cases occur there.

The monkeypox virus clade in the Congo Basin causes more severe disease in humans, with a case fatality rate of 11-17 percent, than the clade in Ghana, which causes few fatalities. It was this latter clade that was introduced into the USA with the importation of African rodents in the pet trade, with resulting human cases in several states and no fatalities.

The USA CDC and their cooperators have been conducting field and laboratory studies to determine which rodent species are reservoirs of the virus. The virus is seldom transmitted directly from one person to another, but there is a documented instance in the Republic of the Congo. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. - Mod.TY]

[Because human-to-human transmission appears to be limited, most monkeypox cases are closely associated with spillover transmission from animal reservoirs. The main reservoirs of monkeypox are believed to be rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ sp.; an arboreal rodent), which were implicated in monkeypox outbreaks elsewhere in the DRC in the 1980s, or terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_.
