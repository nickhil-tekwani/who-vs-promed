Riau is the 11th province affected by [human] avian influenza (AI). A 29
year old woman, who lived in Nangka Permai Residence, Pekanbaru, Riau, was
positive for AI virus, H5N1. [The diagnosis was] based on an RT-PCR (real
time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) test performed in the
Laboratory of the National Institute of Health Research and Development
(MOHRI) in Jakarta on 5 May 2007, and at the Laboratory of Eijkman
Biological Molecular Institute also in Jakarta, on 7 May 2007.
The woman, a merchant, [became ill] on 25 Apr 2007, and was hospitalized in
Awal Bross Hospital, Pekanbaru, on 27 Apr 2007. On 1 May 2007, her
treatment continued in Gleneagles Hospital, Medan, North Sumatera Utara,
where she died on 3 May 2007, at 1130 pm.
As yet, the risk factors are still unknown. A MOHRI (Ministry of Health
Research and Development) united team will visit her residence for
epidemiological investigation. The team consists of personnel from the
surveillance sub-directorate and the zoonosis sub-directorate, both from
the Directorate-General (DG) of Disease Control and Environmental Health,
[and will] cooperate with personnel from MOHRI. A team from the Riau
provincial health office has started an investigation already. As of today
[8 May 2007], the risk factors associated with her [situation have not yet
been identified].
Since H5N1 1st infected humans in Indonesia, in July 2005, 5 provinces in
Sumatera (or Sumatra) have been affected by the disease. Of the 10
provinces in Sumatera, there are still 5 [where no infections have been
recorded]: Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam, Jambi, Bengkulu, Bangka-Belitung, and
Riau Islands.
Since the last death on 5 Apr [May? - Mod.CP] 2007], the number of infected
AI cases in Indonesia totals 95 people, 75 of whom have died. The case
fatality rate (CFR) is 79 per cent. The following table lists the case
numbers and deaths according to province.
Number of H5N1 confirmed cases as of 7 May 2007
-----------------------------------------------
Province / Cases / Deaths
West Java / 29 / 23
DKI Jakarta / 25 / 22
Banten / 12 / 10
North Sumatera / 7 / 6
East Java / 7 / 5
Central Java / 6 / 5
West Sumatera / 3 / 1
Lampung / 3 / 0
South Sulawesi / 1 / 1
South Sumatera / 1 / 1
Riau / 1 / 1
Total Indonesia / 95 / 75
The widening infected area of AI among humans in Sumatera is supposed to
motivate the local government to be more aware of sick or sudden dead
avians. Local government should be more comprehensive in monitoring avian
trading traffic and avian trading in traditional markets. Health personnel
should be more aware of symptoms, such as fever, high temperature, and
cough. According to [a review of recent cases of avian influenza, held by
the DG of Disease Control and Environmental Health, additional symptoms]
are stomach ache and diarrhea. When these symptoms occur, the patient
should [immediately consult] a health center to get first-aid treatment
with Tamiflu [oseltamivir], which is effective if given [within] 2 days
after the symptoms appear in AI infected people.
People should [observe personal hygiene], washing hands with soap,
especially after having contact with avians. Avians should be kept
separately from people's residences. They should always consume good and
well-cooked avian meat and eggs. When they find sick birds or there is a
sudden dead of avians, they must report it immediately to the head of
village or local farming office.

[These figures issued by the Indonesian Ministry of Health are unchanged
from those communicated in the preceding post [Avian influenza, human (75):
Indonesia 20070507.1476], and remain significantly different from those
confirmed by WHO (World Health Organization), but they contain in addition
a breakdown of the data according to province. The distribution of cases by
province is highly skewed with the majority of cases and fatalities
occurring in only 3 of the 30 provinces and 2 special administrative
regions of the Republic of Indonesia.
