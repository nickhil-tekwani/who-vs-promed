Contaminated food recalled
--------------------------
Kyodo News reported 31 Jan 2008 that approximately 494 people in 38
Japanese prefectures had contracted a foodborne illness. The illness
occurred after consuming frozen "gyoza" meat and vegetable dumplings
made by Chinese distributor Hebei Foodstuff.

[U.S.] Naval Hospital officials warn consumers to throw out recalled
foods from Hebei Foodstuff. Service members who buy groceriesd
off-base may find some items in their freezer have been recalled due
to an outbreak of food-borne illness.

Japan's Health, Labour and Welfare Ministry urged companies to stop
selling and importing products from the distributor, which were
found to contain a harmful pesticide.

A Japanese-language list of recalled products can be found at the
ministry's Web site:
<http://www.mhlw.go.jp/>. English speakers can cut and paste text
from the site into Google's "Language Tools" option for translation.
Products include items such as light package pork, sliced ox tongue,
smoked beef, steamed ox tongue, and frozen steamed beef cubes.

The products have been removed from market shelves across the
country, according to officials from U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa.

Although there have been no reported cases of Status of Forces
Agreement personnel becoming ill, hospital officials are urging
service members to dispose of Hebei Foodstuff products purchased
before the announcement and look out for the company's products in the
future.

The effects of the organophosphate insecticides found on many of the
frozen food products are rapid, according to the Center for Disease
Control Web site:
<http://www.cdc.gov/>. Symptoms begin shortly after exposure.
Exposure to the insecticide may pose special risks to persons with
reduced lung function and convulsive disorders. In some cases,
consumption of alcohol may intensify the effects.

"For methamidophos, found in gyoza, symptoms of toxicity start with
vomiting and diarrhea around 10 to 20 minutes after consumption,"
said Michiyo Sekine, a public health specialist for USNH Okinawa.

Some signs of poison include vomiting, sweating, or pin-point pupils,
according to the CDC Web site. Symptoms may also include nausea,
headaches, weakness and dizziness.

"Anyone who feels ill and suspects it might be the result of
consuming one of the recalled products should seek medical
assistance," said Navy Lt. Troy Henderson, the hospital's head of
Preventive Medicine.

If poisoning does occur, a rapid treatment is the best way to ensure
a quick recovery, according to the CDC Web site.

Hebei Foodstuffs facility recalled more than 20 items. Pictures of
recalled food products can be found at
