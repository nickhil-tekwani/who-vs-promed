News
9 high-risk contacts from EVD cases from Lwemba in Ituri intercepted in Ngongolyio, North Kivu
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Beni's Ebola virus disease Sub-Coordinator, Dr Pierre-Celeste Adike, announced on Tue 1 Oct 2019 that 9 high-risk contacts of a confirmed cases of #Ebola Virus Disease from Lwemba, a health area of Mandima health zone in Ituri Province with inter-ethnic conflict and insecurity, were intercepted Tue 1 Oct 2019 by the community in the Ngongolyo health area in North Kivu;
- they were intercepted by a neighborhood chief, who automatically alerted the rebel teams at Beni level. A rapid intervention team was dispatched to this place, where the presence of the mayor of the city of Beni was also noted;
- these 9 people were in transit from Beni at the home of one of their family members to Kabasha, Kalunguta, in Butembo's sub-coordination, from their residence in Lwemba, where they went to attend a bereavement. Immediately after this interception, the members of the host family were vaccinated;
- the follow-up of these 9 contacts will continue in Butembo, especially since their names have already been communicated in the coordination of the response;
- as a reminder, for 15 days, the response activities have been suspended in Lwemba following inter-ethnic conflicts and insecurity.

Coordination of the response to the Ebola virus disease epidemic in favour of the supply of consumables provided by economic operators in Mambasa, Ituri
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The general coordination of the response to the #Ebola virus disease (EVD) has expressed its support for the supply of consumables provided and proposed by economic operators in Mambasa, Ituri province;
- the Vice President of the Economic Federation of Congo (EFC) of Mambasa, Alpha Nasibu Katele, who announced it to the press on [Mon 30 Sep 2019] at the coordination of the Mambasa response after a meeting chaired by the Deputy General Coordinator of the Epidemic Response to Ebola virus disease, Dr Justus Nsio Mbeta, in the presence of the President of the EFC and some members of the EFC Committee in Mambasa, some traders from Mambasa, and partners supporting the response, including WHO, ALIMA, and the Red Cross;
- according to Mr Alpha Nasibu, economic operators in Mambasa are able to supply the base of the response with construction materials, food and would like to see a rotation among traders regarding the rental of large vehicles so that everyone can benefit from the demand for the response;
- this meeting consisted of discussions with economic operators in order to harmonize on the products that the response can buy locally in Mambasa, especially since other needs of the response are international and there are also depots that are already pre-positioned to meet possible eventual needs;
- during this meeting, they were asked to draw up a list of products that could be available in Mambasa to allow the response to exclude them from its list to be ordered from other areas or to inform Mambasa's economic operators of their stock of one or another product;
- indeed, there has already been a 1st meeting between the economic operators of Mambasa and the response teams. During this meeting, economic operators complained that the response team orders their consumables from elsewhere, while in this territory economic operators are ready to respond positively to their needs.

Vaccination
-----------
- A total of 15 days without opening of vaccination rings around 5 confirmed cases in the Lwemba health zone in Mandima [Ituri] due to inter-ethnic conflicts and insecurity;
- no opening of an expanded ring around confirmed cases from 30 Sep 2019 in Biakato health area in Mandima as a result of community reluctance;
- a satellite ring was opened in the Lolwa health area in Mandima.
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 230 956 people have been vaccinated;
- the only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 20 May 2018.

Monitoring at entry points
--------------------------
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the total number of travelers checked (temperature rise) at the sanitary control points is 100 964 142;
- to date, a total of 111 entry points (PoE) and sanitary control points (PoCs) have been set up in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri to protect the country's major cities and prevent the spread of the epidemic in neighboring countries.

[2] WHO: survivors
- Tue 1 Oct 2019. Beni survivors
WHO/AFRO [abridged, edited]
https://www.afro.who.int/news/mothers-survive-ebola-while-pregnant-against-odds-democratic-republic-congo

Mothers survive Ebola while pregnant against the odds in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RKK is one of 5 women in Beni, in northern Democratic Republic of the Congo, who have not only survived Ebola while pregnant but given birth to wriggling, screeching babies, welcome signs of survival.

Women are especially vulnerable to Ebola. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), women and girls aged 11 and older have been infected by Ebola at a higher rate than men and boys in the same age range.

The main reason for this, according to Dr Maurice Kakule Mutsunga, focal point for the WHO Ebola Survivors Programme in Beni, is that women are "primary caregivers within their families, especially for children and older persons and often within the wider community".

This extends to bringing children or sick relatives to hospital and staying with them there while they receive treatment. In many areas, women also continue providing care to sick relatives. It is, again, women who are usually in charge of funeral arrangements, including preparing the body for burial. These activities leave women at greater risk of exposure to Ebola.

For pregnant women, the risks are greater still. Once infected with the virus, they face higher mortality rates from Ebola than the general population. During the West Africa Ebola outbreak, the largest to date, few pregnant women or their unborn foetuses survived. Now, because of access to an Ebola vaccine, new therapeutic treatments and improved detection systems, more and more pregnant women are recovering from Ebola and delivering their babies.

"When my results came back positive, I thought I would die," says UKK, another of the 5 mothers who survived Ebola. "Even after I was cured, I worried every day for the rest of my pregnancy that my baby would die."

Today [1 Oct 2019], 3 months after giving birth, both mother and baby are doing well. Pregnant Ebola survivors in Beni are invited to come and stay in a special facility built for new mothers and babies next to the Ebola treatment centre a month before their due date, a practice borrowed from a public health strategy to limit maternal mortality generally. This helps doctors monitor them closely. When they go into labour, they are brought to the treatment centre, which means babies can be tested for Ebola straight after delivery.

[RKK's] baby tested positive for Ebola soon after he was born. "I was scared," she says, "but, having survived myself this time, I had more confidence. The doctors and the nurses treated him, and he got better very quickly."

As well as testing the babies, healthcare workers, who have been trained by WHO, also test the mother's breastmilk. While the mother's breastmilk was found to contain traces of the Ebola virus, this is not always the case.

Being an Ebola survivor and a new mother comes with other challenges. The community can be reluctant to accept the baby, just as survivors are often treated with suspicion.

"Normally, when someone in our community has a new baby, everyone wants to hold it," says Kavira. "But when I went home, no one wanted to hold my baby or come too close. People thought if they held my baby, they would get Ebola," agrees [UKK].

Both women say their communities are slowly growing to accept their babies, in part because of awareness-raising activities conducted by WHO risk communication and community engagement teams. Negative experiences such as this nonetheless can have a lasting impact on the women.

Studies carried out on communities affected in the West Africa Ebola outbreak found that survivors still experienced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression long after the end of the outbreak. As well as medical follow-up provided by the Ministry of Health, with support from WHO and partners, survivors in the DRC also receive psychosocial care from health care workers trained by UNICEF and WHO. This aims to help them cope with what they have been through and other ongoing challenges.

"I lost my husband and my daughter to Ebola," says [RKK]. "I have suffered a lot, but now I am so grateful I have my son. We are both Ebola survivors together."

[A heartwarming story is always appreciated. Inviting the mothers to enter facilities adjacent to the treatment center one month before delivery is surely contributing to successful births for both the mother and newborn infant. One hopes that as there are more successful births, the stigma these babies face will diminish and eventually disappear. - Mod.LK]

A young mother tells her story of Ebola denial and then gratitude for treatment
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When 33-year-old KV first left a health facility, it was the middle of the night and she was running away.

Staff from the World Health Organization (WHO) were making arrangements to transfer her to an Ebola treatment centre and she was terrified. Fortunately for her, she ran to her neighbour, who happened to be a police officer and knew very well of her family's situation and what [she] needed if she was to survive.

She needed to be evacuated to a proper treatment facility. But [she] was refusing to go. The chief health clinic nurse who took the call from the police officer that 30 Aug 2019 night and made the arrangements remembers how [the patient] resisted "bitterly."

Although she was reluctant to go to the treatment centre, [she] now is grateful. "At the [Ebola treatment centre], much to my surprise, I was warmly received. The doctors would plead with me to eat when I had no appetite. They were really nice and hospitable. I thank them now; I regret my refusal to cooperate and do apologize to every one of them," she says as neighbours, waiting out in the road, sing and dance in celebration of her surviving.

[3] Vaccine
Date: Wed 1 Oct 2019
Source: Precision Vaccinations [abridged, edited]
https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/sudan-ebolavirus-and-marburg-vaccines-will-be-developed-sabin-single-platform


The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced it will support the simultaneous development of individual vaccine candidates against the Marburg virus and Sudan ebolavirus infections.

HHS said in a press release published on 1 Oct 2019, this support will enable the United States to prepare for and respond to these potential health security threats.

These viruses continue to pose potential public health and biodefense threats, says the HHS.

Specifically, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS, initially will provide The Albert B. Sabin Vaccine Institute Inc. with approximately USD 20.5 million dollars and technical expertise to develop these vaccine candidates.

Both diseases are caused by potentially deadly filoviruses, the same family of viruses that includes the Ebola Zaire virus currently affecting communities in central Africa, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Uganda.

People can get these diseases through direct contact with an infected animal or a sick or dead person infected with either virus.

"The Sabin Vaccine Institute's use of a single well-established platform for the Sudan ebolavirus and Marburg vaccines will help to expedite the clinical development process so that the vaccines are available more rapidly," said BARDA Director Rick Bright, PhD, in the press release.

"In addition, by supporting the development of both vaccines simultaneously, BARDA is taking critical steps forward in protecting Americans from these potentially deadly viruses that could emerge and cause outbreaks at any time."

Under the contract, BARDA has the option to provide additional funding to advance both vaccine candidates through Phase 2 clinical development.

Developing the vaccines simultaneously allows Sabin to use the same manufacturing platform, which could speed development and be more cost-effective than developing one vaccine and then the other independently.

The Sudan ebolavirus vaccine candidate is the 1st for this virus strain to receive BARDA support, and the Marburg vaccine candidate is the 2nd to receive BARDA support.

The most recent outbreaks of Marburg occurred in 2012, 2014, and 2017 in Uganda, Africa, where more than 25 percent of people infected died.

The last Sudan ebolavirus outbreak also took place in Uganda in 2012, killing 57 percent of people infected.

In addition to these 2 development projects, BARDA is supporting the development and procurement of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics against the Ebola virus strain currently circulating in the DRC.
