A Bulgarian woman in a village near the Greek border has been
infected with a disease through contact with sick sheep and goats,
veterinary authorities said Mon 20 Aug 2007. A national veterinary
service statement said 19 animals had been infected in the village of
Valche pole where the 65-year-old woman fell ill with the disease.
Veterinarians were examining samples from the animals Monday [20 Aug
2007] to see where the infection came from.
The disease, called brucellosis, is caused by contact with animals
carrying the bacteria or through consumption of infected meat or
[unpasteurized] milk or cheese. It can be fatal for people but is not
transferred from human to human. Brucellosis is rare in Bulgaria with
only isolated cases for the past 50 years, veterinary service chief
Zheko Baychev told the 24 Hours newspaper Mon 20 Aug 2007.
"Most probably the infection spread from neighboring Greece as flocks
sometimes mingle during grazing in the border area between the 2
countries," the veterinary service statement said.
In 2005, 2 Bulgarian shepherds working in a border Greek farm died of
the disease while other workers complained of the extremely bad
veterinary hygiene conditions in the same farm and said they had seen
many animals die from brucella-like conditions there.
All the infected animals in Valche pole will be culled to prevent
further spread of the disease in Bulgaria, the veterinary service said.

[Although not considered endemic in Bulgaria, brucellosis is found in
a number of countries surrounding it. In addition to the 2005 episode
stated in the posting, in 2006, _Brucella melitensis_ was discovered
on a goat farm near Zlatograd (Smoljan province) in the southern part
of the country (see
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/ceah/cei/taf/iw_2006_files/foreign/brucbulgaria061606_files/brucellosisbulgaria061606.pdf>.)
The manifestations of the disease in the human case here are not
stated, nor is the species of _Brucella_ revealed.
Valche pole is a village in Haskovo province east of the Smoljan
province but both bordering on Greece. The location of Haskovo can be found at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskovo>. - Mod.LL]
[According to Bulgaria's annual report to the OIE for 2006, _Brucella
abortus_ is absent (last year of occurrence was 1958), while
_Brucella melitensis_ is present (contrary to the 2005 report, which
indicated that _B.melitensis_ was absent since 1941).
The (apparently exceptional) occurrence of the disease in 2006 was
reported by an immediate notification to the OIE dated 12 Jun 2006.
It referred to 4 goats in a village on the Greek border. The source
of infection was reported to be "contact with infected animal(s) at
grazing/watering." The 4 goats were culled, with no further cases
reported. See the notification, including map:
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5406>
It may be assumed that the current outbreak, similarly to the
outbreak in 2006, is caused by _B.melitensis_. It will be
interesting to note if serological surveillance for _B. melitensis_is
being carried out in Bulgaria, a country having a significant dairy
sheep industry. - Mod.AS]
