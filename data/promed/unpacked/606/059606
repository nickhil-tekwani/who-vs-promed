The fodder market at Wadi Al-Dawaser has been closed after over 160
camels died and another 800 were left sick due to fodder sold at the
market. Livestock owners have also contacted officials in the region,
saying their only source of income is in danger.
The 800 sick camels are currently receiving veterinary care.
Livestock owners are calling for an investigation into the cause of
the deaths and illnesses. Losses are valued to be around SR 250 000
[USD 66 668], Al-Madinah newspaper reported.
