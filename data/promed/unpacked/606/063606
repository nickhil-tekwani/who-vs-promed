California: Condors Receive West Nile Virus Vaccine
---------------------------------------------------
Californian condors, giant birds once driven to near extinction, are being
vaccinated against West Nile virus and seem to be responding well,
according to the scientist who developed the vaccine. The majority of the
roughly 188 condors that have been tested since they were vaccinated
against West Nile virus have developed antibodies, said Jeff Chang, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention research microbiologist who
developed the vaccine.
About 250 condors, the only ones in existence, have been vaccinated as part
of a study conducted by the CDC, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
and Aldevron, a biotechnology company that produced the vaccine. None of
the California condors has tested positive for West Nile virus, a virus
that is believed to have killed millions of birds. The virus can also be
transmitted to humans by mosquitoes and has caused hundreds of human deaths
nationwide.
"We haven't had confirmation that condors are susceptible to West Nile
virus infection," said Chris Parish, condor project director for the
Peregrine Fund, a conservation group helping to return the endangered birds
to the wild. "We are just trying to be ahead of the game by vaccinating
them." The 1st California condor was vaccinated 24 Oct 2004 at the Los
Angeles Zoo, Chang said. The program then expanded to other breeding
facilities and eventually to birds living in the wild. Vaccinations started
in Arizona in June 2003.
Before the vaccine was tested on condors, it was given to crows, said Gavin
Shire of the American Bird Conservancy, which researched the vaccine. The
vaccine reduced the mortality rate in West Nile-infected crows by 40
percent, he said. The condors, which are the biggest and among the most
ancient of North America's birds, nearly became extinct 2 decades ago.
There were only 22 of the birds living in 1982. The Peregrine Fund started
the condor reintroduction program in 1996 with a release at Vermilion
Cliffs, about 30 miles north of Grand Canyon National Park. Nearly 100 of
the birds are in the wild, half in Arizona and half in California. The 1st
condor to successfully fledge in the wild since the reintroduction did so
in 2003.
To vaccinate the birds, biologists must recapture them and administer a
shot. The birds, which can have a wingspan up to 9.5 feet, are lured into
cages with calf carcasses. Then, 3 people are needed to administer the
vaccine, with one person poking the condor's leg with a small syringe. The
birds that were vaccinated in Arizona in 2003 are being given shots again
this year.

Equine Vaccination Success
--------------------------
West Nile virus hits horses harder than humans -- but horses have a better
defense. With 2 FDA-approved equine vaccines for the mosquito-borne
pathogen in wide use, the number of infected horses in the United States
has plummeted. In 2002, 15 257 horses were infected by West Nile virus.
That number dropped to 5181 in 2003, and as of Friday this year [9 Jul
2004] just 46 horse infections have been reported nationwide.
The equine success story is surfacing as the pathogen gains a foothold in
California: 8 new cases of human infection were reported in the past 2
weeks in San Bernardino and Riverside counties, bringing the state tally to
20, state health officials said on Tue 13 2004. In 2003, California posted
3 West Nile cases, none fatal. The virus is much more deadly in
unvaccinated horses, typically killing about 1/3 and leaving 17-20 percent
with residual neurological deficiencies, said Gregory Ferraro, director of
the Center for Equine Health at the University of California-Davis. As of
Monday 12 Jul 2004, West Nile virus has infected 10 horses in California in
2004, all in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, the state department of
food and agriculture reports. Of the 5 that died, none had been vaccinated.
The Food and Drug Administration let horse owners and veterinarians begin
using the equine vaccine months before its safety and effectiveness had
been fully tested. It earned final approval in 2003, and word of its
success has spread through the horse set. The Bay Area is home to more than
a half-million horses, said Two Horse Enterprises, which provides resources
for trail riders.
So why is there a horse vaccine, but none for humans? It's much harder to
get a human vaccine approved, but early clinical trials for a leading
candidate are under way. Researchers at Acambis, a Massachusetts-based
biotechnology company, made the experimental product by tweaking the
vaccine for yellow fever, a disease caused by a virus similar to West Nile.
Realistically, though, experts said a human vaccine won't be available for
several years. "Human products have to go through so much scrutiny," said
Carol Glaser, a viral disease expert at the California Department of Health
Services. "But theoretically, there's every reason to believe it should
work." In addition to high FDA standards, human-vaccine makers face another
hurdle: an unpredictable market. While West Nile virus appears to be here
to stay for the foreseeable future, it isn't nearly as devastating in
humans as it is in horses.
About 20 percent of those infected experience flu-like symptoms, typically
fever, headaches and fatigue. One in 150 develop severe neurological
conditions -- including coma, paralysis and, in rare cases, death. Of the
9862 nationwide cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in 2003, 264 people died. By comparison, more than 30 000 die
each year from the flu, medical studies report. Acambis is aiming its
vaccine at people older than 55 -- the population most at risk for the
disease -- and those traveling to places where West Nile infections are
occurring.
Meanwhile, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, one
of the National Institutes of Health, is preparing for clinical trials of
an experimental treatment for humans infected with West Nile virus. San
Francisco and Santa Rosa are among the new sites to test the product
containing infection-fighting proteins, or antibodies, made by the Israeli
company Omrix.

California: Northwards Spread of West Nile Virus Infection
----------------------------------------------------
A dead crow found on an east San Jose lawn has tested positive for West
Nile virus, signaling that a worrisome outbreak of the mosquito-borne
disease in Southern California has taken a big leap north and landed in the
Bay Area. The discovery was announced on Wed 21 Jul 2004 by Santa Clara
County mosquito-control officials after state lab tests showed that the
crow, found on 28 Jum 2004, had been killed by the virus. California has
been spared a serious outbreak of West Nile virus until this year [2004],
but 32 people have come down with it in Southern California since a dead
crow tested positive 1 Apr 2004, and the disease was diagnosed in a San
Bernardino County woman on 8 Jun 2004.
Sick and dying crows typically presage an outbreak of West Nile virus among
humans. California has found the disease in 876 dead birds in 6 southern
counties. "We have been waiting for quite some months now for West Nile
virus to rear its ugly head in Santa Clara County," said Tim Mulligan,
program manager of the county's vector-control district. "We are
concerned." So far, none of the California patients has died, but a similar
outbreak in Arizona has sickened 125 people and claimed 2 lives. During
2003, 264 Americans died of West Nile virus, the worst year for infections
by the virus since it was discovered in New York City in 1999.
Mulligan said his district has been working full-tilt at mosquito abatement
ever since West Nile virus turned up in Southern California in 2002, and
additional efforts will be directed at the east-side neighborhood where the
dead bird was found. The virus is spread by migrating birds, which probably
explains how it managed to jump 300 miles from its stronghold in Los
Angeles and San Bernardino counties to the Bay Area in a short time,
Mulligan said. A dead crow found in Bakersfield tested positive last week,
the 1st sign of a possible breakout along the central valley flyway. But
crows, which are particularly susceptible to the virus, usually have a
range of only about 20 miles, indicating that infected mosquitoes that
killed the Santa Clara County bird are located nearby.
Vicki Kramer, chief of vector-borne diseases for the California Department
of Health Services, said a very large portion -- 70-80 percent -- of the
dead birds tested in San Bernardino and Riverside counties have tested
positive for West Nile virus, a "red flag" that the disease is highly
endemic in those areas. The disease is particularly lethal to crows,
magpies, jays and ravens -- a family of birds known as corvids.
Early testing in a region tends to focus on corvids, but Kramer said the
state is stepping up its surveillance in the Bay Area for any dead birds.
The state runs a toll-free hot line for citizens to report dead birds, 1
(877) WNV- BIRD, and a Web site,
<http://www.westnile.ca.gov>.
Once West Nile is detected in a region, mosquito control officers can focus
their resources on that area. In San Bernardino County, spraying against
adult mosquitoes in residential neighborhoods has been ordered after less
aggressive methods failed to knock down the number of human cases and
positive test results in pools of mosquitoes and "sentinel" chicken flocks,
whose blood is tested for antibodies to West Nile virus.
West Nile virus originated in Africa and first appeared in the New York
City in 1999. Since then, it has rapidly spread across the continental
United States. Colorado was hit particularly hard during the summer of
2003, with nearly 3000 cases and 63 deaths. So far in 2004, there have been
12 cases in Colorado and no deaths. After a region is hit hard by the
epidemic in one season, it typically is not as heavily affected the
following year. One theory is that the birds and humans develop a level of
immunity that makes it harder for the virus to spread than in a population
never exposed to it.
Nicholas Komar, a research biologist at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention arbovirus lab, in Fort Collins, Colo., said experiments are
under way to determine whether the theory of "herd immunity" is the correct
explanation. Komar said it is too early to tell how 2004's West Nile virus
outbreak will compare with 2003's. The number of cases reported so far in
2004 is higher nationwide than in 2003, but that could be the result of
more screening for the disease.
If the disease follows patterns of the past few years, it will peak in the
first or 2nd week of August, but public health officials will not get the
reports of those illnesses until mid-September because of the time it takes
to test and record the results. "We are seeing an increase in the number of
cases reported every week," Komar said. "The epidemic is on the upswing."

Nevada: 1st Suspected Case of Human West Nile virus Infection in State
---------------------------------------------------
A Clark County resident is suspected of having the disease, the 1st
possible case of a person contracting West Nile virus in Nevada, local
health officials said this morning. The victim, whom the Clark County
Health District identified only as a county resident under the age of 50,
is recovering from an ailment which state tests have determined to be a
virus that is at least in the same family [the _Flaviviridae_] as the
potentially deadly West Nile virus.
Health District spokeswoman Jennifer Sizemore said the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention laboratory in Atlanta is conducting further tests to
determine whether the person has West Nile virus. Sizemore said the results
should be available in about a week. "This would be the first
Nevada-acquired case of the West Nile virus," Sizemore said, noting that
the initial state test results were received Wednesday afternoon. "The
person is recovering at home, but they [?] were hospitalized."
At today's Clark County Health Board meeting, one of the board members
asked Clark County Chief Health Officer Dr. Donald Kwalick whether there
was anything new on West Nile, and Kwalick told the board about the
possible 1st Nevada case. The victim may have been bitten by an infected
mosquito while on a camping trip in the Tonopah area around 4 Jul 2004,
Sizemore said, adding that there also is the possibility that the affected
mosquito bit the person in Clark County. Sizemore said Health District
staff captured mosquitoes from around the person's home Wednesday and will
take some samples from the camping area today to test for the presence of
the virus.
State and Clark County experts have been trapping mosquitoes and checking
dead birds for signs of the West Nile virus. It has been found in a dead
crow this week in Carson City as well as in some mosquitoes in Lyon County,
350 miles north of Las Vegas.
So far, no people, mosquitoes, or birds anywhere in Clark County have been
confirmed to have tested positive for the virus, which has appeared in
California, Arizona and Colorado in the past year. Clark County Vector
Control Officer Richard Hicks, an entomologist, said the disease has moved
rapidly, starting in the East in 1999. "Just because it may show up here is
not a cause for alarm," he said. "Only certain areas of our valley have
mosquitoes, primarily the drainage areas in the southeast part of the Vegas
Wash, which goes into Lake Mead, but not Lake Mead, where there is a wave
action. Mosquitoes prefer stagnant, weedy, smaller areas like puddles (for
their eggs). He noted that Las Vegas' blistering summer temperatures
quickly dry up such locations, leaving mosquitoes even fewer places to
breed. "The best way to avoid mosquitoes is stay out of mosquito haunts,"
Hicks said.
"Campers should take precautions, such as using repellent on their face or
cap, wear more clothing at night and take other such precautions."
"I don't think we've seen anything out of the ordinary this year," he said
of Southern Nevada's mosquito population, adding that he rarely sees as
many as 1000 insects in a single trap. More often the traps capture about
50 insects. In what might be viewed as a positive outcome from the drought,
the dry conditions in Southern Nevada are keeping mosquito populations low.
"The population appears to be lower than average," Hicks said. Clark County
and the Nevada Division of Agriculture have monitored and controlled
mosquitoes in the valley for at least 30 years.
