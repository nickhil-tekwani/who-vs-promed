[According to the report published by FAO-EMPRES on "Sub-Saharan Africa HPAI situation update" (latest update on 7 Jun 2017), H5N1 has been confirmed in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria and Togo.

In Togo:
- FAO provided preliminary assistance to the Veterinary Services for disease control. This included assistance in the establishment of response teams, drafting of a short term action plan, meeting with WHO, participation in a press conference with the Minister in charge of livestock, WHO, and MoH as well as preparation of daily sitreps.
- Advanced genetic characterization of the virus identified in Togo confirmed that it belongs to clade 2.3.2.1.c., which is the same clade circulating also in other West and Central African countries.
