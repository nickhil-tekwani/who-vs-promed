China's Military Veterinary Institute of Military Medical Sciences has detected a new type of SARS-like coronavirus in the bats of Yunan Province [SARS is an acronym for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome].

Analysis shows that the virus can infect humans, and it may be the precursor of the SARS virus or a "relative." The discovery represents an important discovery in the hunt for the source of SARS. According to researcher Tu Changchun, bats carry more viruses than any other creature. 130 different strains [virus species] have been found. Although in recent years, many types of coronavirus have been found in bats, and it has gradually been established that bats are the natural host of SARS-like coronaviruses, there has been no evidence of transmission to human beings, and no evidence showing there are significant differences in the genetic structure of the virus. A new virus has now been found in Yunnan bats, and the genetic diversity of this new virus has been clarified. The research group also found that a rotavirus infecting bats in the region may be the cause of diarrhea among children in Southeast Asian countries.

In 2012, the Middle East reported an infectious disease caused by a new coronavirus: Middle East respiratory syndrome [virus]. The clinical manifestations are similar to SARS, causing a general panic similar to that accompanying the original SARS outbreak.

[The preceding news item was translated from a Chinese-language article and refers to a recent paper published in the Journal of Virology entitled "Identification of diverse alphacoronaviruses and genomic characterization of a novel SARS-like coronavirus from bats in China." By Biao He and 12 others at the China's Military Veterinary Institute of Military Medical Sciences.

Abstract:
"Although many severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses (SARS-like CoVs) have been identified in bats in China, Europe and Africa, most have a genetic organization significantly distinct from human/civet cat SARS CoVs in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which mediates receptor binding and determines the host spectrum, resulting in their failure to cause human infections and making them unlikely progenitors of human/civet SARS CoV.

Here, a viral metagenomic analysis of 268 bat rectal swabs collected from 4 counties in Yunnan province has identified hundreds of sequences relating to alpha- and betacoronaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis based on a conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene revealed that alphacoronaviruses had diversities with some obvious differences from those reported previously. Full genomic analysis of a new SARS-like CoV from Baoshan (LYRa11) showed that it was 29 805 nt in length with 13 open reading frames (ORFs), sharing 91 percent nt identity with human/civet cat SARS CoVs and the most recently reported SARS-like CoV Rs3367, while 89 percent with other bat SARS-like CoVs. Notably, it showed highest sequence identity with the S gene of SARS CoVs and Rs3367, especially in the RBD region. Antigenic analysis showed that the S1 domain of LYRa11 could be efficiently recognized by SARS-convalescent human serum indicating that LYRa11 is a novel virus antigenically close to SARS CoV. Recombination analyses indicate that LYRa11 is likely a recombinant descended from parental lineages that had evolved into a number of bat SARS-like CoVs."

Conclusion: The authors conclude that although many SARS-like coronaviruses (CoVs) have been discovered in bats worldwide, there are significantly different genomic structures, particularly in the S1 domain, which is responsible for host tropism determination, between bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS CoVs, indicating that most reported bat SARS-like CoVs are not the progenitors of human SARS CoV. We have identified diverse alphacoronaviruses and a close relative (LYRa11) to SARS CoV in bats collected in Yunnan, China. Further analysis showed that alpha- and betacoronaviruses have different circulation and transmission dynamics in bat populations. Notably, full genomic sequence and antigenic study demonstrated that LYRa11 is phylogenetically and antigenically closely related to SARS CoV. Recombination analyses indicate that LYRa11 is a recombinant from certain bat SARS-like CoVs circulating in Yunnan province.

Clearly, the coronavirus described above is closely related to the bat coronaviruses associated with SARS and MERS but is not directly responsible for these diseases. - Mod.CP
