The Malaysian Health Ministry has sent 2 virologists to the northern
state of Kelantan to investigate the death of 2 teenage girls who
were feared to have died from Japanese Encephalitis (JE), local
authorities said Thursday. [see also prior ProMED Digest posting
below].
The work of the 2 experts from the Institute of Medical Research and
National Public Health Laboratory would help the health ministry to
work out strategies to control the virus, Deputy Director-General of
Health Shafie Ouyub was quoted as saying by the Bernama news agency.
Shafie made the remarks in Kelantan before being briefed on the JE
situation by Kelantan Health Director Ahmad Razin Ahmad Maher.
According to local reports, the county of Tanah Merah has reported
one confirmed JE case and 4 suspicious cases. A 27-year-old woman has
been confirmed to be infected with JE virus. She is now warded at a
local hospital.
Last Thursday [26 Jan] and this Tuesday [31 Jan], 2 female students
13 years old died after showing JE symptoms.
Though tests showed one of the girls died of acute neurological
syndrome, her father, 34, and her 5-year-old brother showed JE
symptoms. The cause of death of another girl has not been disclosed
yet.
Health Director-General Ismail Merican will issue a full statement on
this matter Friday in Kuala Lumpur, Shafie told reporters.
The JE virus is transmitted when _Culex_ mosquitoes bite an animal
infected with the virus, usually a pig, before biting humans, causing
the virus to enter the bloodstream of the final host (humans).
Meanwhile, Agriculture and Agro-based Industries Minister Muhyiddin
Yassin said the Veterinary Services Department had taken blood
samples from different animals in Tanah Merah to determine whether
they carry the virus.
If domestic animals are found to be carrying JE virus, they will be
quarantined and culled, said Muhyiddin.
Kelantan reported the last JE case in 1995.

The 2 girls in Tanah Merah in Kelantan who allegedly died from the
Japanese Encephalitis (JE) virus actually succumbed to dengue and
bacterial meningitis, said Health Minister Datuk Dr Chua Soi Lek.
Test results released yesterday showed their deaths had nothing to do
with the JE virus, he said here.
"I am puzzled as to how the Kelantan Health Department director could
issue a statement that the state could have a JE outbreak when the
test results on the 2 deaths were only concluded today (Thursday).
"We want the people in Tanah Merah to know that the ministry has
taken measures to monitor a possible JE outbreak in their area," he
said before attending a Ledang MCA division Chinese New Year dinner
here.
2 13-year-old schoolgirls were until recently believed to have
succumbed to the JE virus.
The 34-year-old father of one of the victims and her 5-year-old
brother are suspected JE cases and have been warded at the Raja
Perempuan Zainab II Hospital in Tanah Merah.
Another patient, a 27-year-old woman, had reportedly been confirmed
as being infected by the JE virus.
2 virologists, one from the Institute of Medical Research and another
from the National Public Health Institute, have arrived in Kota Baru
to help the state health authorities determine if the JE virus had
re-emerged in the state. JE was last reported in Kelantan in 1995.
Health Ministry deputy director-general Datuk Dr Shafie Ooyub, who
accompanied them, said their main task was to provide technical
expertise and to analyses the data collected. He added that they
would determine if the 5 recent cases here were JE-related.
In another development, forest rangers have been deployed in Tanah
Merah to track down wild boars suspected of being JE carriers.
State Veterinary Services department director Dr Idris Kadir said
blood samples had been taken from animals around the area.

[The above newswires appear somewhat contradictory as the 1st one
seems to support the concerns that there is JE activity in Kelantan.
The 2nd newswire seems to rule out confirmation of JE as the etiology
of the deaths attributable to an acute neurologic syndrome caused by
JE, but rather attributes one death to dengue fever and the other to
acute bacterial meningitis. ProMED-mail would appreciate more
information from knowledgeable sources on the status of JE activity
in Kelantan, Malaysia to clear this confusion up. - Mod.MPP]
