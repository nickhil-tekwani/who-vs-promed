Observing that almost a year has passed since the last rabies case was reported, the provincial administration expressed its confidence that the island would soon be completely free of rabies.

The latest rabies case occurred last April [2012]. To be acknowledged with the status "rabies free," Bali has to have 2 consecutive years without a single occurrence of rabies in either animals or humans.

"It could be possible that Bali will be free of rabies, because the last rabies case found in a human was last April [2012]," head of the Bali Health Agency I Ketut Suarjaya said on Tuesday [26 Mar 2013].

Sanglah Hospital stated that only about 2 percent of dog bite cases were positive for rabies virus infection.

Rabies cases in humans in Bali have been decreasing in recent years. While in 2008, 4 cases were recorded, and 2009 saw 48 cases, and the largest number, 82 cases, was recorded in 2010, after the mass dog vaccination program was implemented in Bali, a reduction in cases started to be seen. In 2011, 24 cases were recorded, and by 2012 only 8 cases occurred.

Meanwhile, Sanglah Hospital's Secretary of the Rabies Mitigation Team, Dr. Ken Wiransadhi, acknowledged that rabies vaccination distribution had become more selective these days. The rabies vaccine is prioritized for multiple and deep wounds caused by stray dogs. Free-of-charge rabies inoculations are provided at state-owned hospitals only for dog bite wounds in vital organs, including the head, face, fingers and genitalia. The vaccine can also be purchased at medical clinics.

Last week, the Bali Health Agency stocked up with 5000 vials of anti-rabies vaccine that is estimated to be sufficient for around 1250 people for the next few months. Some 750 vials have been distributed to rabies centres in Regencies. The head of the Bali Husbandry Agency, Putu Sumantra, also announced that stage 4 of the mass dog vaccination for all the 300 000 dogs in Bali would start in mid-April 2013 and run until June this year [2013].

According to agency records, the latest mass rabies vaccination program included 80 percent of the dog population on the island, around 250 000 dogs, while 500 more had been sterilised. The Bali administration is confident that the island will be able to achieve its target of being free from rabies by 2015. However, residents are expected to bring their dogs to have this free vaccination. Over the past couple of years, Bali has attempted to control the spread of rabies through a mass dog vaccination program and sterilization.

Since the island's rabies outbreak started in 2008, there has not been much improvement in the way that Balinese communities care for their pet dogs, say experts. "There's only been a small change in attitude in the way they care for their dogs. The dogs are still let loose to look for food on the streets," chairman of the Bali chapter of the Indonesian Association of Veterinarians, I Gusti Ngurah Mahardika, said recently. Mahardika said it was urgent for Balinese communities to care for their dogs by feeding them at home and vaccinating them regularly. "Dogs do bite. Thus, preventing them from contracting rabies is most important," said the virologist, citing that the main methods of prevention are proper care and regular vaccinations for the dogs as well as public awareness of the need to have a rabies shot after being bitten by a dog.

Meanwhile, Arie Rukmantara, spokesman for the national commission on zoonoses, said that the main challenge to free the island from rabies was maintaining people's commitment and participation. "If an outbreak occurs for several years, it is crucial to maintain the commitment of local people to participate in the eradication efforts. He said the 2015 target was reasonable, considering that the administration had implemented efforts to accomplish this since the 1st case of rabies was found in Jimbaran in 2008.

[Significant progress has been achieved towards eradication of human rabies in Bali by improving the availability of vaccine and access to post-exposure prophylaxis. The eradication of canine rabies by vaccination and sterilisation has achieved significant results, but final elimination is likely to be thwarted unless the population can be educated to take better care of their domestic animals. - Mod.CP
