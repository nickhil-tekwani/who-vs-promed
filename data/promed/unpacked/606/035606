[The current lumpy skin disease (LSD) epizootic in Federal Russia began on 25 May 2016. Earlier, the disease was reportedly absent since its circulation during the 2nd half of 2015, declared resolved on 30 Dec 2015. The above follow-up report No. 17 addresses a new outbreak in a backyard holding where 2 cows were kept, of which 1 was reportedly affected. This is the 1st case in a province (oblast) hitherto not affected, namely the Samarskaya (Samara) oblast in European Russia. In fact, it is the 1st case in Russia's federal administrative district Volga, in which Samara is one of 16 oblasts (map at http://tinyurl.com/j77jktm). This event demonstrates the continued spread of the disease in a north eastern direction.

Summarised epidemiological statistics of the Russian LSD epizootic since its start in May 2016 and as of 14 Oct 2016, available in WAHID archive, follows:

Total outbreaks = 290 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 117 952 / 6605 / 207 / 10 / 0

Samara is the 16th province affected by LSD in Russia during the current epizootic. Those territories, as reported to the OIE, are (listed in order of 1st infections):
1. Krasnodarskiy Kray
2. Respublika Dagestan
3. Respublika Kalmykiya
4. Chechenskaya Respublika
5. Astrakhanskaya Oblast
6. Stavropol'skiy Kray
7. Respublika Ingushetiya
8. Krasnodarskiy Kray
9. Volgogradskaya Oblast
10. Rostovskaya Oblast
11. Karachayevo-Cherkesskaya
12. Respublika Adygeya
13. Kabardino-Balkarskaya Resp
14. Tambovskaya Oblast
15. Ryazanskaya Oblast
16. Samarskaya Oblast

The disease initially spread in the Federal District South Russia (aka North Caucasus), from where it penetrated the Federal District Central Russia and now, when reported in Samara, the Volga Federal District. Russia's federal districts are presented at http://tinyurl.com/je8xsxm.

LSD has not been reported from any Russian oblast adjacent to Samara. The closest affected oblast is Volgograd, separated from Samara by Saratov (map at http://www.mapsland.com/maps/europe/russia/large-detailed-administrative-divisions-map-of-russia-2001.jpg). LSD has, though, been reported in a territory which has a common border with Samara: the Republic of Kazakhstan, where a large-scale event was reported in July 2016 in the north-west, reportedly remaining solitary (see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=20520).

It will be interesting to be informed about the results of epidemiological investigations into the possible route of LSD introduction to the Samara oblast. - Mod.AS
