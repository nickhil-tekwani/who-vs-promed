On Tuesday [1 Jun 2021], the European Commission announced that the European Union [EU] Digital COVID Certificate was finally live. At launch, 7 EU countries are using the app, and the other bloc countries will roll it out by 1 Jul [2021]. The free mobile app provides digital proof via a QR code that a traveler has been vaccinated against COVID-19, has recently tested negative for COVID-19, or has recovered from the illness.

A European Union spokesperson told CNN [Cable News Network] yesterday [Wed 2 Jun 2021] that the app could be extended to citizens from non-EU countries, including the United States. In principle, holders of the EU Digital COVID Certificate should be exempted from travel restrictions such as quarantine requirements.

"Right now, if you're an American, not living in the EU, you could get the certificate if you ask the national authorities of a member state to give you that certificate based on some proof that you've been vaccinated, or had a recent COVID test," said the EU spokesperson. The decision on whether to allow non-EU citizens to use the app would rest with each individual member state.

The Digital COVID Certificate just started rolling out. Each EU member state can launch the certificate on a voluntary basis provided it is ready to issue and verify certificates and have the necessary legal base in place. The commission is calling the month of June [2021] the "warm-up phase." So far, only 7 European member countries are using the pass: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Greece, and Poland.

Sixteen other EU countries plus Switzerland have finished the testing phase and are technically ready to begin using the pass at any time. These include Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, France, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.

In addition, 7 more countries -- 4 in the EU and 3 outside the bloc -- are currently in the testing phase: Finland, Hungary, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Slovakia, and Slovenia. The EU Digital COVID Certificate includes limited information such as the traveler's name, date of birth, and relevant information about the vaccine received, COVID test results, or recovery from COVID. This data remains on the certificate and is not stored or retained by visited countries.

All 3 vaccines available in the United States -- Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson -- will be covered under the EU certificate. Last month [May 2021], the 27 ambassadors for European Union agreed to open their borders to vaccinated Americans and other non-EU citizens after more than a year of travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some EU member states, including Greece, had already started allowing tourists to visit without quarantine requirements if they have been vaccinated. Next week, Spain and France will open their borders to US travelers on 7 Jun and 9 Jun [2021], respectively.

https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/06/03/1002878557/why-contact-tracing-couldnt-keep-up-with-the-u-s-covid-outbreak


Here's one (more) sign the COVID-19 pandemic is on the decline in the United States: NPR's latest survey of state health departments with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security finds many are winding down the contact tracing programs they scrambled to grow last year [2020]. More than half of the 36 health departments that responded to the survey in late May [2021] had fewer tracers than in December [2020], and the vast majority aren't planning to hire more.

In a way, that makes sense. With coronavirus infections tapering off in most parts of the country, public health experts said a smaller workforce may be able to keep on top of current outbreaks. But there are some big questions as these programs transition from full-throttle crisis mode to something new. Why, despite furious efforts to ramp up the workforce last year [2020], was the US not able to use testing and contact tracing to control the pandemic? And how can the country be better positioned for the next public health emergency?

The Biden administration recently allocated USD 7.4 billion in funding to hire public health workers, potentially infusing the system with resources. Now state and local health departments, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have to figure out how to build on the success and learn from the failures of the past year.

"What's coming next -- with all this funding from the federal government to scale up public health workforces -- is really critical," said Crystal Watson, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and collaborator with NPR on the contact tracing survey. "It has to go beyond, how do we sustain this specific workforce very focused on contact tracing, to how do we make sure that we have the workforce we need to do better public health every day?"

Early in the pandemic, with no vaccine in sight, contact tracing seemed like one of the best options to halt the burgeoning pandemic. Places such as Hong Kong and Singapore initially contained their outbreaks by deploying thousands of public health workers to track down every positive case, figure out their contacts, and quickly get those people to quarantine.

But in the US in April 2020, state health departments told NPR they had only about 11 142 contact tracers, which clearly wasn't enough to do something like that in a country of 330 million people. Public health experts told Congress the country needed to increase the workforce tenfold to 100 000 or more. "We are going to need a substantial expansion of public health field workers," then-CDC-director Robert Redfield told NPR in April 2020. "We can't afford to have multiple community outbreaks that then can spiral up into sustained community transmission. So it is going to be very aggressive, what I call 'block and tackle, block and tackle.'"

Local and state health departments responded with a massive hiring and training effort. Over the course of 2020, NPR and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security surveyed state and territorial health departments on their contact tracing programs 5 times. From 11 000, the contact tracing workforce grew to a peak of more than 70 000 in December [2020].

By the time cases started to spike dramatically last winter, it was clear "we still did not have enough people to respond and deliver case investigation and contact tracing," said Dr Melanie Taylor, an epidemiologist at CDC who's currently a senior advisor on contact tracing in the agency's COVID-19 emergency response. The dream of an army of contact tracers who would stop the spiral into sustained community transmission had largely fallen through.

One reason the US wasn't able to hire enough contact tracers to handle the winter surge -- even with millions of Americans unemployed -- is because health departments had to staff up after decades of cuts. "Scaling up contact tracing was a larger task because you weren't just starting from zero, you were starting from a deficit when it came to the workforce," said Adriane Casalotti of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. "Local health departments entered the pandemic down over 20% of their workforce capacity. We didn't have a deep bench; we didn't have a bench at all," she added.

Katherine Feldman, contact tracing program manager for Maryland's Department of Health, said the problem wasn't just finding people to hire; it was much more complicated. "It takes a minute to recruit qualified staff and train them up and get them going," she said. Then, she said, because of the intensity of the work, contact tracers might only work part time or leave after a few months. When the virus spread out of control, staffing got even more complex. She had to figure out, "How many staff are you going to actually need on a certain day? How long is it going to take to recruit those folks and get them trained up and ready to go? It's challenging," Feldman said. "I think we actually did a pretty good job in the face of all of that."

But perhaps the biggest reason that the US wasn't able to scale up enough, Casalotti said, is that communities began to open up in the spring and summer of 2020 before hires were trained and ready to go. Once cases surged, there was no way contact tracers could keep up. It was kind of like "trying to build the plane while flying it," she said. "The system was not in place in advance, and that really made it a lot harder for contact tracing overall to be as successful as it could have been."

For contact tracing to work, first of all, people need to answer the phone. In the US contact tracing effort, that proved to be a big problem. A CDC analysis of 14 contact tracing programs from June to October 2020 published on Thursday [3 Jun 2021] in JAMA Network Open found that "no contacts were reported for 2/3 of persons with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 because they were either not reached for an interview or were interviewed and named no contacts." The authors assessed that, during this period, "contact tracing activities were not sufficient for reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in most communities." In other words, it didn't work very well.

"The trust aspect has been an uphill battle throughout all parts of the response," said Nicole Roberts, who runs the contact tracing program in Utah. As cases grew and the pandemic became more and more politicized, that distrust grew stronger, she said. A recent poll by the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found only 52% of Americans really trust CDC; the numbers for state and local health departments were even lower. The distrust was especially strong among Republicans: 27% of Republicans greatly trust CDC, compared with 76% of Democrats.

"Before we had people who were not getting vaccinated because of political reasons or under the guise of freedom, we had people who weren't going to pick up the phone when a contact tracer called," Casalotti said. Sometimes that distrust turned ugly. Dozens of public health leaders have resigned or been forced out, Casalotti noted. "Some of them were physically threatened, their families were threatened, others who were politically scapegoated," she said.

Trust is a challenge, agrees Feldman in Maryland. "We don't want to be public health police," she said. "We want to be perceived as service deliverers and connections to resources and [able] to provide guidance and help for these difficult times." Distrust got in the way -- not only when it came to connecting with public health workers -- but also when it came to the technology that was part of contact tracing's success in other parts of the world.

"Earlier on in [Utah's] response, we had an app called Healthy Together that used GPS location and was supposed to be a really amazing tool for contact tracing, kind of similar to what we were seeing in South Korea," Roberts said. The app, she said, was a "disaster." She said the first challenge was getting people in Utah interested and willing to download the app. "Then, once people found out that the app was tracking where you had been through GPS, there was a huge outcry," she said, and many people turned the GPS feature off.

Utah -- and many other places -- now use the "exposure notification" platform from Apple and Google, which lets Bluetooth anonymously track proximity and alert people if they have been near someone who tested positive, without tracking movements. "It works a little better," Roberts said, but the ways that it protects privacy also limit how much it can tell the health department about what's going on with the virus. Feldman said in Maryland officials are still evaluating how much these digital tools helped. "I can't give you a quantitative measure of its impact," she said. "But I am very glad to have it as another tool in the toolbox."

It was hard work for health agencies lacking resources to scale up to face the pandemic last year [2020] without an infusion of funding. Now that funding has arrived at what experts hope is the tail end of the COVID-19 crisis.The Biden administration's new funding is designed to put state and local health departments on stronger footing to do both the bread-and-butter work of public health -- restaurant inspections, rabies control, HIV outreach -- and to be better prepared next time an infectious disease outbreak or pandemic hits. But state and local leaders are not sure what to do with the money that's now available. "We're just being inundated with so much funding that it's almost like you're scrambling, trying to figure out what all to use it on," Roberts said.

In Utah, they're having to move staff around. "Cases dropped pretty drastically, and so then we had a ton of people and we were wondering what to do with everyone," she said. Some contact tracers transitioned to helping with mobile COVID-19 testing teams or vaccine clinics. Watson of Johns Hopkins hopes the federal government will provide guidance about the best positions to hire, for instance. In NPR's latest survey of state health departments, "there were very few respondents who had some concrete idea of how they would use those American Rescue Plan funds," she said. "The funds are so new," CDC's Taylor noted, that it'll take time for health departments to figure out what they'll need. "I do say that CDC is standing by to assist states to implement those funds."

This funding represents a huge opportunity to reverse the years of disinvestment in the public health system, said Casalotti of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. She hopes the funding makes it to the local level. "Local health departments are really that front line of the federal, state, local partnership," she said. The new funding is on a timeline. "There is a lot of concern -- rightly so -- that this money is still temporary," Watson said. After it runs out, there's no guarantee it will be replenished. So there's a fear that after the current funding feast, "a few years from now, we might be hitting famine," said Roberts of the Utah Department of Health. Then, if there are new political leaders with different priorities, health departments will be in the difficult position "where we've built all of these programs and we have all of this capacity, and then the funding will dry up because the pandemic response is no longer sexy."

Watson and other public health experts said they hope the US will break this cycle so that -- in the next pandemic -- the country won't have to build the contact tracing plane while flying it.

[Among the problems the contact tracing program in the US faced were health departments not having had sufficient staff after decades of cuts. It is critical to maintain a strong public health infrastructure that is ready to respond to new outbreaks immediately with trained personnel. Furthermore, there was distrust in public health workers as well as the technology that was part of contact tracing's success in other parts of the world.

See ref: Lash RR, Moonan PK, Byers BL, et al. COVID-19 case investigation and contact tracing in the US, 2020. JAMA Netw Open. 2021; 4(6): e2115850. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.15850.

"Key Points
Question: What proportion of persons with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and their contacts are reached for case investigation and contact tracing?

"Findings: In this surveillance-based, cross-sectional study, 2 of 3 individuals with COVID-19 were either not reached for interview or named no contacts when interviewed. A mean of 0.7 contacts were reached by telephone by public health authorities, and only 0.5 contacts per case were monitored, a lower rate than needed to overcome the estimated global SARS-CoV-2 reproductive number.

"Meaning: The findings of this study suggest that current contact tracing practice had suboptimal impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

"Abstract
Importance: Contact tracing is a multistep process to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Gaps in the process result in missed opportunities to prevent COVID-19.

"Objective: To quantify proportions of cases and their contacts reached by public health authorities and the amount of time needed to reach them and to compare the risk of a positive COVID-19 test result between contacts and the general public during 4-week assessment periods.

"Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study took place at 13 health departments and one Indian Health Service Unit in 11 states and one tribal nation. Participants included all individuals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and their named contacts. Local COVID-19 surveillance data were used to determine the numbers of persons reported to have laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were interviewed and named contacts between June and October 2020.

"Main Outcomes and Measures: For contacts, the numbers who were identified, notified of their exposure, and agreed to monitoring were calculated. The median time from index case specimen collection to contact notification was calculated, as were numbers of named contacts subsequently notified of their exposure and monitored. The prevalence of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test among named and tested contacts was compared with that jurisdiction's general population during the same 4 weeks.

"Results: The total number of cases reported was 74 185. Of these, 43 931 (59%) were interviewed, and 24 705 (33%) named any contacts. Among the 74 839 named contacts, 53 314 (71%) were notified of their exposure, and 34 345 (46%) agreed to monitoring. A mean of 0.7 contacts were reached by telephone by public health authorities, and only 0.5 contacts per case were monitored. In general, health departments reporting large case counts during the assessment (greater than or equal to 5000) conducted smaller proportions of case interviews and contact notifications. In 9 locations, the median time from specimen collection to contact notification was 6 days or less. In 6 of 8 locations with population comparison data, positive test prevalence was higher among named contacts than the general population.

"Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of US local COVID-19 surveillance data, testing named contacts was a high-yield activity for case finding. However, this assessment suggests that contact tracing had suboptimal impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, largely because 2 of 3 cases were either not reached for interview or named no contacts when interviewed. These findings are relevant to decisions regarding the allocation of public health resources among the various prevention strategies and for the prioritization of case investigations and contact tracing efforts." -Mod LK]

[4] Neurologic sequelae

Two new meta-analyses detail neurologic and psychiatric conditions in COVID-19 patients, one suggesting that symptoms such as fatigue and depression are common even in people with mild illness, and the other showing central and peripheral nervous system involvement in up to 36% of cases that increased the risk of hospitalization.

In the 1st study, published yesterday [3 Jun 2021] in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry, a team led by University College London (UCL) researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 215 COVID-19 studies from 30 countries involving 105 638 symptomatic COVID-19 patients from January-July 2020 [ref: Rogers JP, Watson CJ, Badenoch J, et al.: Neurology and neuropsychiatry of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the early literature reveals frequent CNS manifestations and key emerging narratives. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry. 2021; doi: 10.1136/jnnp-2021-326405].

The commonest symptoms were loss of smell (43%), weakness (40%), fatigue (38%), loss of taste (37%), muscle pain (25%), depression (23%), headache (21%), and anxiety (16%). The researchers also identified major but less common neurologic disorders such as ischemic stroke (1.9%), hemorrhagic stroke (0.4%), and seizures (0.06%). Among the few nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients with mild illness in the dataset, neurologic and psychiatric symptoms were still common, with 55% reporting fatigue, 52% loss of smell, 47% muscle pain, 45% loss of taste, and 44% headache.

In a UCL news release, lead study author Jonathan Rogers said his team had expected neurologic and psychiatric symptoms to be more common in severe COVID-19. "But instead, we found that some symptoms appeared to be more common in mild cases," he said. "It appears that COVID-19 affecting mental health and the brain is the norm, rather than the exception."

The researchers posited that brain inflammation, insufficient levels of oxygen delivered to the brain, and psychosocial factors such as isolation may be behind these symptoms. "Our finding that the most frequently reported neurological symptoms actually occurred more frequently in those with less severe COVID-19 suggests that neurological symptoms are not necessarily correlated with systemic or respiratory symptoms, implying that different mechanisms or timing of mechanisms may be involved," they wrote.

The authors called for more research on symptoms of mental illness, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, along with strokes and seizures, in COVID-19 patients.

Co-senior author Alasdair Rooney, of the University of Edinburgh, said in the release that clinicians should be aware that neurologic and psychiatric symptoms are very common in coronavirus patients. "With millions of people infected globally, even the rarer symptoms could affect substantially more people than in usual times," he said. "Mental health services and neurological rehabilitation services should be resourced for an increase in referrals."

The 2nd study, published earlier this week in BMC Infectious Diseases, was a meta-analysis of 143 observational and descriptive studies involving 10 723 COVID-19 patients with nervous system involvement. It was led by researchers from Universidad de La Sabana in Colombia. [ref: Guerrero JI, Barragan LA, Martinez JD, et al. Central and peripheral nervous system involvement by COVID-19: a systematic review of the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, neuropathology, neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and cerebrospinal fluid findings. BMC Infect Dis. 2021; 21(515); https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-06185-6].

The researchers identified 119 studies published from December 2019-June 2020 on the clinical manifestations of neurologic involvement in COVID-19, 62 on neuroimaging findings, 60 on cerebrospinal fluid results, 51 on pathophysiologic mechanisms, 28 on electrophysiologic findings, and 4 on neuropathologic findings.

They found a prevalence of nervous system involvement in coronavirus patients ranging from 22.5% to 36.4%. Neurologic involvement increased the likelihood of hospitalization by roughly 81%. Death rates were not explicitly tied to COVID-19 neurologic involvement but rather to systemic disease.

Fifty-three studies reported 8129 signs and symptoms of COVID-19 central nervous system involvement, including neuropsychiatric disorders (61.3%), headache (22.2%), dizziness (6.6%), impaired consciousness (5.2%), delirium (4.3%), nausea and vomiting (0.3%), and neck stiffness (0.1%). Loss of smell or taste, brain damage, and stroke were also common. Psychiatric symptoms included anxiety, mood disorders, psychosis, and insomnia, among others.

Focal neurologic conditions among 410 patients, most associated with stroke, were described in 28 studies. They included movement disorders, speech disorders, amnesia, visual field disturbances, and others. Twenty-eight studies reported seizures in 346 patients, about 90% of them new onset. "Critical neurological events were more frequent among patients with a severe infection than those with mild disease," the researchers said. "Patients with COVID-19 admitted with respiratory compromise only, who developed neurological conditions, tended to progress with a more severe course, with increased intubation and mechanical ventilation requirements."

The authors said that prospective cohort studies are needed to analyze the mid- and long-term complications of nervous system involvement in COVID-19, while randomized clinical trials should assess the effectiveness of treatments for coronavirus-related neurologic conditions. "International collaborative efforts and exhaustive neurological registries will enhance the translational knowledge of COVID-19's central and peripheral neurological involvement and generate therapeutic decision-making strategies," they wrote.

[The conclusion of one of the researchers, Dr J Rogers (UCL Psychiatry and South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust), that "It appears that COVID-19 affecting mental health and the brain is the norm, rather than the exception", is very disturbing. These symptoms appear to occur equally in severe and mild disease. Taken together with the long COVID sequelae, COVID could be considered more than an acute infectious disease.

"While this review did not investigate causal mechanisms, the researchers suggest a few possible explanations. In the acute phase of the illness, inflammation has been found in the brain, which may explain some of the symptoms. Psychosocial factors relating to the context of the global pandemic may play a role, as people who are acutely ill may feel isolated when they cannot see their family or friends, which may explain why depression and anxiety have been found in some COVID-19 studies to be more common than in other viral illnesses such as the flu.

Dr Rogers said: "Many factors could contribute to neurological and psychiatric symptoms in the early stages of infection with COVID-19, including inflammation, impaired oxygen delivery to the brain, and psychological factors. More studies are needed to understand these links better" (from https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-06/ucl-nsl060221.php). - Mod.LK]

The 2nd wave of COVID-19 is steadily declining across the country, but the fall in cases has been much sharper in northern and central India than in the south and Maharashtra. India reported 131 739 fresh cases on [Thu 3 Jun 2021]. Nearly 70% of these cases were reported from Maharashtra and the southern region alone, which together accounted for 91 308 new cases, as per TOI's COVID database.

The share of Maharashtra and the south in total cases has been creeping up over the past month [May 2021]. On [27 May 2021], exactly a week ago, the share stood at 66.5%. In comparison, on [6 May 2021], the day India recorded its highest single-day case count of 414 554, Maharashtra and south together made up 50% of the total. A comparison of Thursday's [3 Jun 2021] case count with that of [6 May 2021] reveals while Maharashtra and the south have together seen a 56% decline in cases the national count has gone down by over 68%.

Pakistanis over 18 years can now get vaccinated for COVID-19 from today [3 Jun 2021] under a national vaccination plan devised by the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC). In this regard, NCOC chief Asad Umar had made an announcement earlier this week, saying that with this development, the vaccination of all eligible age groups would be carried out simultaneously.

Pakistan had opened registrations for citizens aged 19 and above for coronavirus vaccination on 16 May [2021]. In a tweet, Umar had said registration will be open for the entire national population, which is approved by health experts for the vaccine. Umar had explained that the government was opening up registrations for more age groups as Pakistan's vaccine supply continues to improve and the country's vaccination capacity gets enhanced day by day.

Previously, Pakistan had opened registration for the vaccination of people aged between 40-49 years across the country on 3 May [2021] and, subsequently, began walk-in vaccinations for people of the same age group. The federal government has launched a digital portal for the registration through which a code is assigned to the person. They can then go to a designated vaccination centre and get a jab.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 4 Jun 2021 at 06:06 GMT:

Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 28 574 350 / 340 719 / 245
Pakistan: 928 588 / 21 105 / 94
Bangladesh: 805 980 / 12 724 / 77
Nepal: 576 936 / 7630 / 258
Sri Lanka: 195 844 / 1608 / 75
Afghanistan: 76 628 / 3068 / 77
Maldives: 66 516 / 173 / 315
Bhutan: 1654 / 1 / 1

Over the last 7 days, 1 026 645, 10 995, 17 286, 34 680, and 5573 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and the Maldives, respectively, compared with 1 515 714, 9791, 17 841, 53 611, and 10 141 in the preceding 7 days, revealing a sharp decreasing trend in India, Nepal, and the Maldives and a slow upward trend again in Bangladesh, but a trend of stability in Pakistan. In Sri Lanka, the curve of the 2nd wave is still growing from the trend of new cases that started creeping up over the last 4 weeks or so; 20 983 new cases were registered in the country over the last 7 days as opposed to 20 075 in the preceding 7 days. The daily number of reported cases in Afghanistan is also increasing, but remains stable at a lower rate in Bhutan, compared with other South Asian countries.

Only time will say whether or not the slow but steady increasing trend of daily case-positivity, as being observed over the last 10 days or so in Bangladesh, would develop a new wave in the country due to detection of the delta variant (previously called B.1.617.2), a variant of concern, in some districts bordering India.

Around 220 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in India so far (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57354069).

As indicated in item [5D] above, Pakistan has reportedly opened registrations for citizens aged 19 and above for vaccination against COVID-19, expecting an enhancement of vaccine supply in the future. There is no mention, however, in the article of how and when doses of the vaccine required would be made available for them.
