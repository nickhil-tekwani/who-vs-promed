Brazil health authorities confirmed today [Thu 20 Apr 2017] the death of a person from yellow fever in Maricá, one of the municipalities in metropolitan Rio de Janeiro, the city most emblematic and the tourist destination of Brazil, as well as the 2nd most populated.

The confirmation was made nearly one month after the municipal authorities initiated a vaccination campaign against the disease for the 6.6 million inhabitants of the metropolitan region.

According to a bulletin issued this [Thu 20 Apr 2017] by the Rio de Janeiro Secretariat, with the death of the patient from Maricá that brings to 3 the number of fatal yellow fever victims in this state in Brazil and to 11 the number of confirmed cases of the disease.

The other 2 deaths have been registered at the end of March [2017] in Casemiro de Abreu and Porciúncula, 2 small populations more than 100 km [45 mi] from the regional capital and near to forested areas.

The newest victim died on [Thu 20 Apr 2017] in the Evandro Chagas Hospital, a state medical reference center to which he was transferred upon suspicion that he had contracted yellow fever.

After confirmation of the new death, the Regional Secretary of Health, Luiz Antonio Teixeira, sent medical teams to Maricá to strengthen the vaccination campaign. "We are going to continue to give priority to the areas in which there is confirmation of virus circulation and the nearby localities," he stated.

Maricá was one of the 65 municipalities of Rio de Janeiro state included in the list of priority cities for vaccination.

Rio de Janeiro initiated a campaign on 25 Apr [Mar ?] [2017] to vaccinate the entire population in the city against the disease that is transmitted by a mosquito and in just in the 1st day about 212 000 people were immunized.

The Rio de Janeiro municipal Secretariat advanced the preventive campaign after the confirmation of the 1st cases of yellow fever in Rio de Janeiro state that sounded the alarm.

But the yellow fever outbreak that Brazil suffers since this past December [2016] is concentrated in states neighboring Rio de Janeiro, mainly Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo and Sao Paulo.

According to the Ministry of Health latest bulletin, issued 2 weeks ago, since December [2016] 604 yellow fever cases have been confirmed, with 202 deaths.

[Brazil has embarked in a race against time, vaccinating the population in affected areas before urban cycles with transmission by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes can be initiated. So far, all cases have been attributed to spill-over from sylvan (forest) transmission. The quick response by health authorities so far has been successful in preventing urban transmission, but cases so near to a major population center such as Rio de Janeiro city, with abundant _Aedes aegypti_ populations, is worrisome.
