A _Cyclospora_ illness outbreak tied to Kwik Trip stores has worsened, with about 50 people now having reported they were sickened from vegetable trays that contained broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and dill dip.

Kwik Trip has entered into an agreement with the city of Oak Creek and Milwaukee county as a partner in emergency services. The city finalized the deal on [15 Aug 2018].

Kwik Trip has removed the 6-ounce and 12-ounce trays from its stores, according to state health officials. The trays may also have been available from other businesses, not yet named by health agencies, officials said.

_Cyclospora_ is a parasite commonly found in developing countries. During the summer, outbreaks and illnesses occur from contaminated fresh produce entering the US from endemic countries.

As of [Thu 14 Jun 2018], the number of _Cyclospora_ cases suspected from the Kwik Trip vegetable trays sold in Wisconsin had risen from 11 to roughly 30 in less than a week, and 20 more cases were reported in Minnesota.

Cyclospora infections are relatively rare in Wisconsin. Almost half of the 60 cases reported so far this year [2018] were connected with the Kwik Trip vegetable trays produced by Del Monte Foods, according to state health officials.

Symptoms of _Cyclospora_ infection include diarrhea, loss of appetite and weight, cramping, bloating and gas, nausea, and vomiting. If untreated, the illness may last more than a month and could continue over a recurring cycle, health officials said. To test for the presence of the parasite, stool specimens must be collected and sent to a laboratory.

Washing of imported produce is unlikely to kill the parasite, which can only be seen with a microscope. The infections are not spread from person-to-person.

[On Thu 14 Jun 2018], an Eau Claire [Wisconsin] woman sued Kwik Trip and Del Monte for having become ill from the vegetable trays she purchased in Eau Claire. A similar lawsuit was filed by a woman from St Charles, Minnesota. The Eau Claire woman has been ill for weeks, according to her attorney, [RO] of Minneapolis, who said he's been contacted by about 35 people this week claiming they were sickened from the vegetable trays.

La Crosse-based Kwik Trip, which has stores across Wisconsin and Minnesota, is cooperating with state health officials in their investigation. Del Monte, which produced the vegetable trays for Kwik Trip, did not respond to questions from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Minnesota also is investigating another _Cyclospora_ outbreak stemming from Sonora Grill in Minneapolis. So far, 17 people have reported illnesses.

"If you ate at Sonora Grill during the weekend of [18-20 May 2018], please contact the Minnesota Department of Health Waterborne Diseases Unit," state officials said.

Nationwide, from May to August 2017, there were 206 cases of _Cyclospora_ infections reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, up 134 percent from 88 cases reported in the same period in 2016.

Previous US outbreaks have been linked to imported fresh produce such as basil, cilantro, lettuce, raspberries, and snow peas. Most cases in the US have been reported in the spring and summer.
