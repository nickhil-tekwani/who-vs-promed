France will cull all wild boar in a zone along the Belgian border to try and avoid an outbreak of a deadly swine disease after new cases were discovered nearby in Belgium, the French agriculture ministry said on [Mon 14 Jan 2019]. France has been on alert for African swine fever [ASF] since the virus was confirmed in September [2018] among wild boar in Belgium, not far from the French border. ASF, harmless for humans, is often deadly for pigs, and outbreaks in Eastern Europe and China have disrupted the pork industry there.

"The confirmation of 2 cases of ASF, on [Wed 9 Jan 2019], in Belgium at about 1 km [approx. 0.6 mi] from the border, leaves our country more exposed than ever to this major risk for pig farming," a ministry statement said. "We are now at a maximum risk level."

France would create a boar-free zone spanning several km (miles) its side of the border by culling all wild boar in the coming weeks and erecting a perimeter fence in the next few days, the ministry said.

Poland, one of the eastern European countries to have faced cases of ASF in recent years, is planning to cull 185 000 wild boar across the country, drawing protests from hunters that the measure was excessive.

The disease can be carried by wild boars but experts also stress that human factors such as transport, clothing and food waste can play a role in spreading the disease.

No vaccination or treatment exists for the highly contagious virus. Outbreaks often lead to export restrictions on pig meat.

Last year's [2018] outbreak of ASF among wild boar in Belgium marked a sudden westward spread of the virus in Europe, raising the risk it would reach large pork-production countries like Germany, France and Spain.

The authorities in Belgium's French-speaking region of Wallonia have also stepped up surveillance measures since last week, extending a restriction zone on its side of the French border.

[For the location of the 2 ASF cases confirmed on 9 Jan 2019, see map published by French media at https://tinyurl.com/y7lb3mgh. These cases were reported in post 20190110.6251604.

The area in which wild boars will be depopulated is coined "white zone" according to another French media report dated 15 Jan 2019; see (in French) at

Belgium has submitted its 17th follow-up report addressing the ASF event in the province Luxembourg on Mon 14 Jan 2019. The report informs about 19 new "outbreaks", involving 35 infected wild boars, of which 33 were found dead and 2 were killed; all confirmed ASF positive. The said report, with an interactive map presenting the locations of the new outbreaks, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=29201.

This brings the total number of outbreaks, reported to the OIE since the start of the Belgian event on 9 Sep 2018, to 183, involving 322 ASF-infected wild boars of which 314 were found dead and 8 were killed. OIE's interactive map, showing all 183 outbreaks, is available at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=27948 (click on the cluster, zoom in).
The Belgian authorities have managed to prevent the leakage of the virus into its domestic pig population by the application of a proactive policy control policy, culling all pigs within the declared zone.

So far, the only country which managed to control an ASF event limited to wild-boar is the Czech Republic. The event started on 21 Jun 2017 and was resolved 19 Apr 2018. During the event, which was limited to the eastern district Zlin, the virus was identified in 221 wild boars (defined as 221 "outbreaks"), of which 203 were found dead and 18 were killed. Links to all (37) reports and an interactive map presenting all "outbreaks" are available at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=24159.
The measures applied by the Czech authorities to control and eradicate ASF from wild boar within its territory were described in a presentation, available at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20180919_pres_asf_cze.pdf.

EU's Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed (Section Animal Health and Welfare) is due to convene in Brussels on Wed 16 Jan 2019; ASF is one of the main issues on the agenda. - Mod.AS
