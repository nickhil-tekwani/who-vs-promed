A Clark County infant who recently traveled overseas has tested
positive for measles, health officials reported late Tuesday [15 Feb
2011]. Anyone who might have come into contact with the child is urged
to seek a vaccination for this uncommon but highly contagious disease
before Thursday [17 Feb 2011], said Dr Alan Melnick with Clark County
Public Health.

On Monday [14 Feb 2011], the child visited the Evergreen Pediatric
Clinic and Southwest Washington Medical Center in Vancouver. Anyone
who visited those locations on Valentine's Day -- particularly between
1:30 pm and 6 pm at the clinic and between 4:30 pm and 8:30 pm near
the pharmacy or outpatient lab at the hospital -- could be at risk of
exposure.

Measles is a potentially serious disease characterized by a rash,
fever, and one or more of the following symptoms: cough,
conjunctivitis, sneezing, nasal congestion, and nasal discharge,
Melnick said. Outbreaks are uncommon in the United States -- where
vaccinations have effectively eliminated the disease -- but they do
occur.

To find out if you are susceptible to measles, call Clark County
Public Health at 1-360-397-8025 or contact your doctor.

The source and precise date of the child's infection are not
disclosed, other than it occurred out side of the USA. The 1st sign of
measles virus infection is usually a high fever, which begins about 10
to 12 days after exposure to the virus, and lasts 4 to 7 days. A runny
nose, a cough, red and watery eyes, and small white spots inside the
cheeks can develop in the initial stage. After several days, a rash
erupts, usually on the face and upper neck. Over about 3 days, the
rash spreads, eventually reaching the hands and feet. The rash lasts
for 5 to 6 days, and then fades. On average, the rash occurs 14 days
after exposure to the virus (within a range of 7 to 18 days). The
highly contagious virus is spread by coughing and sneezing, close
personal contact, or direct contact with infected nasal or throat
secretions. The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on
infected surfaces for up to 2 hours. It can be transmitted by an
infected person from 4 days prior to the onset of the rash to 4 days
after the rash erupts. For more information about measles, see the WHO
fact sheet at
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs286/en/index.html>.
