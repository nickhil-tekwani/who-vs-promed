The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) has confirmed the 1st case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a Virginia horse this year [2015]. The affected horse, a 12 year old miniature mare, was from Chesapeake and had not been vaccinated for EEE. Last year [2014], Virginia had one reported case of equine EEE in a horse from Suffolk.

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures. The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2-3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care; fatality rates reach 75-80 per cent among horses. Horses that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems.

Earlier this year [2015], Richard Wilkes, DVM, VDACS' state veterinarian, encouraged horse owners to work with their veterinarians to plan a vaccination schedule that would protect their horses from EEE and West Nile virus (WNV), another mosquitoborne disease. Available vaccines are generally effective in drastically reducing the incidence of both EEE and WNV in horses. For the vaccine to be effective, it must be handled and administered properly and be given at least 2 weeks before the horse is exposed to the virus. In addition, to stimulate full immunity, horses must be vaccinated twice, about 30 days apart, the 1st year of vaccination. The vaccines are effective for 6-12 months, so horses should be revaccinated at least annually. In an area where the disease occurs frequently, such as southeast and Tidewater Virginia, most veterinarians recommend vaccination every 6 months.

In addition to vaccination, it is a good idea to avoid mosquito-infested areas and to take measures to reduce the local mosquito population to minimize the chances of mosquitoes biting your horse.

[It is a mite late to be vaccinating your horses against EEE and WEE, but better late than never, as EEE is frequently lethal for horses, and the vaccines are a cheap insurance against losses.

Many years ago when Kenny Samui -- a grad student from Zambia now risen high in his country -- and I were studying equine arboviruses, we persuaded a number of equine vets in the Florida parishes to bleed their clients' horses just before vaccinating them. When we titrated their equine serum, we found that the response to vaccination was mild. But if a horse had been exposed to EEE since the previous vaccination 12 months prior, its titre was way above what we expected; memory says 4 to 5 times higher. Keep this in mind if you are ever tempted to run a retrospective serosurvey for incidence of subclinical cases. - Mod.MHJ
