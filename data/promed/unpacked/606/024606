Confirmation of a case of rabies in a dog imported from Morocco
---------------------------------------------------------------
A case of rabies in a dog -- brought back from Morocco on 1 Aug 2011
-- in the Vendee was confirmed on Thursday [11 Aug 2011] by the
Pasteur Institute, and all people who were in contact with the dog
have been put under preventive care [presumably being offered
post-exposure prophylaxis], according to a statement of the Prefecture
of Vendee.

Following a change in behavior, the 3 month old puppy was isolated and
placed under veterinary supervision on 6 Aug 2011. The puppy died on
the night of 7 Aug 2011. While tests were being conducted by the
Pasteur Institute, an epidemiological investigation was launched by
the Regional Office of Health Pays de la Loire, which identified 24
people who had contact with the animal.

"These people are under the care of the rabies treatment centre.
Vaccination has been or will be performed in case of contact
considered to have posed risk of infection," said a statement from the
Prefecture. Rabies virus is mainly transmitted to humans by bite, but
saliva in contact with a wound can also result in transmission of
infection, said the Prefecture.

"This case points out the risk that may be associated with animals of
unknown origin [imported] from countries where animal diseases
transmissible to humans are prevalent," said the Prefecture, which
stressed the need "to be aware of health regulations and ensure
compliance before importing any animal."

[It is suspected, but not confirmed yet, that the dog was imported
illegally. As the references below indicate, importation of companion
animals into France from North Africa has in the past posed risk of
transmission of rabies.

The Vendee is a department in the Pays-de-la-Loire region in west
central France, on the Atlantic Ocean. The name Vendee is taken from
the Vendee river which runs through the south eastern part of the
department. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of France can be
