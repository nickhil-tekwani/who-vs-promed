Man dies from rabies in Kharkov
-------------------------------
A 26 year old man died from rabies several days ago in Kharkov. His own dog
had bitten him 3 months previously. The young man often visited relatives
in the Volchansky district. He brought with him his pit bull terrier and
liked to walk in a wood where, according to Diana Oboskalova, the
physician-epidemiologist in the regional Sanitary epidemiological station
of Kharkoviit, it is surmised that his dog encountered a sick fox. Some
time later the dog fell ill. "Encephalitis" and drowsiness were diagnosed
in a veterinary clinic and euthanasia was advised. The dog owner agreed.
His relatives stated that the man had not sought medical treatment
immediately after he was bitten by his dog. Other dog owners agree that the
young man was an experienced dog handler and his pit bull terrier had been
vaccinated [against rabies]. This was the reason why the young man had not
sought medical treatment. Probably an unregulated imported vaccine had been
administered to the dog. But now it is impossible to find out, whether this
is the reason for the pit bull terrier's death.
The owner buried the dog in an unknown grave. A couple of months after the
dog had been euthanized, the young man became illl. Until recently
clinicians had failed to establish a diagnosis of rabies although the
patient exhibited many of the symptoms of a serious neurological disease.
The patient died subsequently and now epidemiologists are looking for the
veterinarian who euthanized the pit bull terrier and may be at risk of
having contracted rabies.
Subsequently all those who had contact with the patient have been
vaccinated. A total of 2 vaccination facilities have been opened near his
home in Kharkov and around Revolutionniy where he spent much of his time,
in order to vaccinate any dogs that may have have had contact with the pit
bull terrier. Epidemiologists and veterinaries are advising all dog and cat
owners in Kharkov to have their pets vaccinated against rabies.

[The significant feature of this report, apart from the tragic death of the
dog owner, is the the suspicion that the owner's dog had been vaccinated
with an unapproved non-standard anti-rabies vaccine, possibly one imported
into the Ukraine. It would be useful generally if the Ukrainian veterinary
authorities could identify the origin of the defective vaccine and make the
information widely available to avoid any further unnecessary deaths. - Mod.CP]
