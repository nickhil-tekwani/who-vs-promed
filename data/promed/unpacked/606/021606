[The trickle of cases reported from Saudi Arabia continues. With the addition of the newly reported case and fatality, the total number of cases reported from Saudi Arabia since 2012 is now at 1311 including 556 deaths. The newly reported case is from Buraidah. The last reported cases from Buraidah (Buraydah) were reported on 29 Nov 2016 and 16 Dec 2016, the former a primary case, the latter a healthcare acquired case in a heathcare worker. One always wonders where the exposure may have occurred in an individual without a history of contact with camels or with other known laboratory-confirmed cases -- perhaps the individuals had contact with undiagnosed infected individuals in either the healthcare setting or in the community.

According to the WHO report, there have now been a total of 1644 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 590 related deaths. This does not include the 15 newly confirmed cases and 2 deaths that were reported since 16 Feb 2016.
