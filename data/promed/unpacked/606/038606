Influenza at the human-animal interface (HAI)
Summary and assessment, 28 Sep to 30 Oct 2017
---------------------------------------------
Risk assessment: The overall public health risk from currently known influenza viruses at the human-animal interface has not changed, and the likelihood of sustained human-to-human transmission of these viruses remains low. Further human infections with viruses of animal origin are expected.
IHR compliance: All human infections caused by a new influenza subtype are required to be reported under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). This includes any animal and non-circulating seasonal influenza viruses. Information from these notifications is critical to inform risk assessments for influenza at the human-animal interface.

Avian influenza viruses
-----------------------
Current situation
- Avian influenza A(H5) viruses
Since the last update on 27 Sep 2017, no new laboratory-confirmed human cases of influenza A(H5N1) virus infection were reported to WHO.

Since 2003, a total of 860 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, including 454 deaths, have been reported to WHO from 16 countries.

Influenza A(H5) subtype viruses have the potential to cause disease in humans and thus far, no human cases, other than those with influenza A(H5N1) and A(H5N6) viruses, have been reported to WHO. According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe and Asia.

- Avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses
Since the last update on 27 Sep 2017, no new laboratory-confirmed human cases of influenza A(H7N9) virus infection were reported to WHO.

Since 2013, a total of 1564 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses, including at least 612 deaths, have been reported to WHO. If the incidence of human cases follows the trends seen in previous years, the number of reported human cases may rise over the coming months. Further sporadic cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are therefore expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas.

According to reports received by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on surveillance activities for avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses in China, positives among virological samples continue to be detected in poultry from live bird markets, commercial and backyard farms. The agricultural authorities in China have announced that vaccination of domestic poultry against infection with avian influenza A(H7) viruses has commenced, in addition to the ongoing poultry vaccination program against avian influenza A(H5) viruses.

Information from a recent publication on influenza A(H7N9) virus transmission was considered during this risk assessment. The publication presents new information on one of the highly pathogenic (HP) avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses, which emerged in late 2016-early 2017. The study confirms that like the low pathogenic (LP) avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses, this HP influenza A(H7N9) virus can transmit via respiratory droplets between ferrets. Vaccine viruses are being developed by the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) to cover this and other potentially similar HP A(H7N9) viruses.

Overall, the risk assessment has not changed. The influenza A(H7N9) viruses have not exhibited sustained human-to-human transmission since their emergence in 2013 and no significant changes in the virus properties or the epidemiology of human infections have been observed. Rapid sharing of information and viruses is essential to detect emerging changes and conduct rapid risk assessment with increased confidence. WHO, through GISRS, and in collaboration with the OIE-FAO Network of Experts on Animal Influenza (OFFLU), research and academic institutions and national authorities, will continue monitoring the A(H7N9) virus situation very closely. WHO will continue to reach out to partners and reassess the risk as new information becomes available.

Risk assessment
---------------
1. What is the likelihood that additional human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses will occur?
Most human cases are exposed to the A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Additional sporadic human cases of influenza A(H7N9) in other provinces in China that have not yet reported human cases are also expected.
2. What is the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses?
Even though small clusters of cases have been reported, including those involving healthcare workers, currently available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood is low.
3. What is the risk of international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus by travelers?
Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.
