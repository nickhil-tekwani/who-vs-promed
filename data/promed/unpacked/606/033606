The Associated Press world service reported on an epidemic of foot and
mouth disease [FMD] in Iraq, as disclosed by a UN official on conditions
of anonymity.
According to this official FMD has crippled at least 1 million sheep and
cattle, and threatens the country's entire livestock population because
vaccines are lacking. He said the implications of the disease are
catastrophic: farmers could be ruined, and meat and milk would become
more scarce in a country where UN sanctions for the past 8 1/2 years
have produced commonplace shortages. At least 50 000 animals, mostly
lambs, kids and calves have died in the outbreak, with about 12 percent
of the country's livestock affected.
