Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 - Democratic Republic of the Congo [10 Jul 2018]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 3 different circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreaks have been detected in acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases. In February 2018, the government declared cVDPV2 to be a national public health emergency.

The cVDPV2 strain initially detected and reported in June 2017 from Haut Lomami Province spread in late 2017 and early 2018 to Tanganyika and Haut Katanga provinces, respectively. The same virus was confirmed in Ituri Province in June 2018, close to the border with Uganda, from an AFP case with onset of paralysis on 5 May 2018. Investigations are ongoing. WHO assessed the overall public health risk at the national level to be very high and the risk of international spread to be high due to the proximity of the recent detection of the AFP case in Ituri which is close to an international border and with known population movement.

Maniema Province is affected by a separate cVDPV2 outbreak, with 2 cases confirmed in 2017. The date of onset of paralysis of the most recent case was [18 Apr 2017]. So far, no new cases have been detected in 2018, and there is no evidence that this virus has spread further geographically.

The 3rd and most recently detected outbreak of cVDPV2 was found in Mongala Province and isolated from an AFP case in the Yamongili Health Zone. The onset date of paralysis was [26 Apr 2018]. Circulation of the strain was confirmed when the same strain was isolated in stool specimens from 2 healthy community contacts.

Public health response
----------------------
WHO and partners are responding to these outbreaks, including through the use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed upon outbreak response protocols. However, operational gaps in the response continue to hamper the full implementation of these protocols, as high-risk populations remain under-immunized, and the response thus far has not controlled the outbreak nor prevented its spread.

The geographic extent of the outbreak response to all 3 strains is now being re-evaluated, given the confirmed spread of one of the strains to Ituri and confirmation of the new strain in Mongala.

Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.

In February 2018, the government declared cVDPV2 to be a national public health emergency. The remaining operational gaps in the outbreak response must be urgently addressed.

WHO risk assessment
------------------
WHO assessed the overall public health risk at the national level to be very high and the risk of international spread to be high. This risk is magnified by known population movements between the affected area of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Central African Republic and South Sudan, and the upcoming rainy season which is associated with increased intensity of virus transmission.

The detection of cVDPV2s underscores the importance of maintaining high routine vaccination coverage everywhere to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation. These events also underscore the risk posed by any low-level transmission of the virus. A robust outbreak response is needed to rapidly stop circulation and ensure sufficient vaccination coverage in the affected areas to prevent similar outbreaks in the future. WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented.

WHO advice
----------
It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents and visitors for more than 4 weeks from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel. As per the advice of the Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus must continue as it remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travelers.

WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and/or trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the basis of the information available for the current cVDPV2 outbreaks.

[The above WHO update in [1] provides an excellent overview of the cVDPV2 situation in the DR Congo. As presented in prior posts, polio has been an ongoing issue in the DR Congo since 2017 when 2 separate outbreaks were identified (see prior ProMED-mail posts referenced below). An additional worrisome occurrence was the identification of a 3rd outbreak with confirmation of a case near the border with Uganda, and the very real threat of international spread of the virus.

There is an excellent map showing the involved areas at the source URL.

Situation analysis
Description of the disaster
Papua New Guinea (PNG) health authorities have confirmed that the country is experiencing its 1st polio outbreak in 18 years, after one case of the virus was confirmed in an urban settlement in the country's 2nd largest city. The virus was 1st detected in late April [2018], and confirmed in late May [2018]. Experts say the virus is now "circulating" in the affected community. PNG was certified polio-free in 2000, and has not had a case since 1996. PNG's Department of Health is working alongside the World Health Organisation (WHO) to respond to the outbreak of the potentially deadly virus, which can cause lifelong paralysis in children.

The Department of Health and World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed in a joint statement, that the virus was 1st detected in a child in April [2018] and a vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (VDPV1) was isolated as the cause of paralysis in May [2018]. Earlier this month [July?], the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that the virus was circulating in the community after stool samples from 2 healthy children in the same area tested positive for the virus.

This represents an outbreak, said the World Health Organization (WHO). Ministry of Health priority now is to respond and prevent more children from being infected. WHO and the Health Department have been working together with other partners including IFRC/PNGRCS [International Federation of the Red Cross/ Papua New Guinea Red Cross Society] to conduct a large-scale immunization campaign and strengthen surveillance systems that would detect the virus. National Department of Health are also collecting stool specimens from family members of patients and the community in a "mop-up" immunization campaign targeting children.

As [polio] is an infectious disease which normally spreads through the faeces of an infected person contaminate the water or food. Urban settlements in PNG's major cities have no proper water and sanitation facilities, also lack of health awareness in settlement areas in towns. People living in the settlements are migrants from rural areas for economic opportunity.

As WHO stated that the version of the virus circulating in the settlement is a "vaccine-derived poliovirus", meaning it is a mutated version of the weaker polio virus used in vaccinations. Vaccine-derived polioviruses are rare, and tend to occur in populations with very low vaccination rates. They develop when children who have not been vaccinated come into contact with the excrement of vaccinated children, and are exposed to the weaker virus. The WHO and PNG authorities have launched an emergency immunization campaign to try to prevent other children from becoming infected.

Lae is the 2nd largest city of PNG, which is located in Morobe province. Morobe province reportedly had a polio vaccination rate of 61 per cent prior to the outbreak. PNG Health Authorities said 845 children had been immunised since the virus was 1st detected. Due to low immunization coverage in other bordering province Madang and Eastern Highland are also targeted for polio awareness and immunization campaign which will start in July 2018.

According to WHO, the index case is a 6-year-old boy from '4 mile' settlement in Lae, Morobe, VDPV type 1 confirmed from child's stool - Confirmed by VIDRL (Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory) on [Mon 21 May 2018]. As per WHO guidelines, the total of 22 from Morobe and 20 from Eastern Highlands children in the index case community contacts were tested, to determine if the virus is circulating. Figure 1 below shows the affected and immediate risk districts identified by the National Department of Health and the National Polio Outbreak Taskforce. [available at source URL]

On [Thu 21 Jun 2018], results received from lab that the same virus was found in 2 contacts in Lae. This demonstrates that the virus is circulating in Lae, Morobe; however, missed transmission in other areas cannot yet be ruled out. The following day on [Fri 22 Jun 2018], the National, International Health Regulations (IHR) Focal Point of Papua New Guinea notified WHO of the index case of cVDPV1 and the confirmation cVDPV1 among 2 asymptomatic community contacts of the index case. A few days later on [Mon 25 Jun 2018], the National Department of Health declared a polio outbreak in Papua New Guinea. On [Tue 26 Jun 2018], the Papua New Guinea National Executive Council and Cabinet declared the polio outbreak as a National Public Health Emergency. The Government committed PGK 6.7 million ([approximately Swiss Francs] CHF 2 million) to support outbreak response. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) provided initial supported to Papua New Guinea with USD 500 000 ([approximately Swiss Francs] CHF 497 000) for response activities. On [Wed 27 Jun 2018], the National Department of Health activated the National Emergency Operations Centre and formed a National Emergency Response Team.

Surveillance activities planned by WHO:
- Increase the target rate for non-polio AFP
- Increase the annualised target for non-polio Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) rate to 3 cases per 100 000 population in the provinces of Chimbu, Eastern Highlands, Jiwaka, Madang, Morobe, Western Highlands and National Capital District.
- Increase the annualised target for non-polio AFP rate to 2 cases per 100 000 population in all other provinces.
- Collect stool samples from contacts of AFP cases
- Collect stool samples from 3 close family or household contacts of all AFP cases in Goroka, Lae, Madang City and Port Moresby.
- Collect stool samples from 3 close family or household contacts of all AFP cases with inadequate stool sample collection in the provinces of Chimbu, Eastern Highlands (outside Goroka), Jiwaka, Madang (outside Madang City), Morobe (outside Lae), Western Highlands and National Capital District.

In 7 highest risk provinces, (Morobe, Madang, Eastern Highlands Province, Jiwaka, Chimbu, Western Highland Province, National Central District)
- Active search of AFP cases.
- Review medical records for last 6 months.
- Training on AFP surveillance for health care workers to be conducted.
- Implement environmental surveillance, initially in National Central District and Lae.

Table 1: Low Vaccination coverage (percentages) across the provinces:
Province: 2014 / 2015 / 2016 / 2017
Morobe: 28 / 76 / 61 / 35
Eastern Highlands: 60 / 57 / 41 / 43
Madang: 15 / 46 / 39 / 27
Overall in PNG: 64 / 74 / 73 / 47

[The Relief Web/IFRC Situation Analysis provides a more detailed discussion on the outbreak in Papua New Guinea, involving a cVDPV1. A major concern is that this is occurring in the 2nd largest city/town in Papua New Guinea with documented circulation in the community. The vaccination covereages provided in Table 1 are indicative of the situation in the country, with vaccination coverages ripe for circulation of polioviruses either wild or vaccine-derived.

As highlighted in prior comments, polio vaccination coverages have not been uniformly maintained at high enough levels to prevent spread of a poliovirus (both WPVs and cVDPVs) in many of the countries around the world. This has especially been noted in countries after declaration of a polio-free status of the country. Higher vaccination coverages were maintained through the national immunization days and subnational immunization campaigns, which decreased in frequency once polio free status was declared in countries and neighboring countries. The appearance of outbreaks of VDPVs in multiple countries around the world in recent times (Syria 2017, DR Congo 2017-2018, Somalia 2017 - environmental sample 2018 human case, Kenya 2018 - environmental sample, and Papua New Guinea 2018).

Of interest is the identification of "at risk countries" by WHO and available on the Global Polio Eradication Website. These countries identified to have both low levels of vaccination coverages and inadequate surveillance activities that are risk factors for poliovirus introduction and circulation within the countries. Fifteen countries identified as high risk countries include: Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Iraq, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Liberia, Madagascar, Myanmar, Niger, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Ukraine. (see http://polioeradication.org/where-we-work/key-at-risk-countries/ for list of countries and links to country specific information). Remembering the media report on municipalities in Brazil noted to have suboptimal vaccination coverages, there are many countries not included on the "high risk country list" where there are pockets of unimmunized populations that should there be a traveller introducing a poliovirus into these pockets, there could be transmission of the poliovirus (again both WPV and cVDPV's) (see Poliomyelitis update (27): global 20180706.5890218).
