Disease update as at 1830 Wed 28 Mar 2001 [GMT+1
-------------------------------------------------
At 1830 today there were 728 cases in Great Britain and 1 in Northern
Ireland. A total of 30 cases have been confirmed today.
The numbers of cases by county are as follows: Anglesey 13, Berkshire 2,
Cheshire 6, Co Durham 42, Cornwall 2, Cumbria 284, Devon 77, Derbyshire 8,
Dumfries & Galloway 93, Essex 10, Gloucestershire 29, Herefordshire 19,
Kent 4, Lancashire 8, Leicestershire 2, Monmouthshire 5, Northants 1,
Northumberland 12, Oxfordshire 2, Powys 22, Scottish Borders 1, Shropshire
6, Somerset 1, Staffordshire 24, Tyne & Wear 15, Warwickshire 4, Wiltshire
6, Worcestershire 20, North Yorkshire 5, and West Yorkshire 3.
Of the 55 million livestock in the UK 719 000 have been identified for
slaughter and 441 640 have already been slaughtered leaving 277 360
awaiting slaughter. 323 213 carcasses have been disposed of. Our priority
is to cull all animals on infected farms within 24 hours of the disease
being identified. Veterinary advice indicates that this coupled with
movement restrictions is the most significant measure for eradicating the
disease. We are meeting this target in all areas except Cumbria where the
intensity of the disease is at its worst.
Vaccination has always been an option. We are actively considering the use
of vaccination as a disease control measure in certain circumstances. We
are currently seeking contingency permission from the EU Standing
Veterinary Committee to use vaccination - if we consider it the right approach.
780 soldiers are now deployed at MAFF's request. They are providing
logistical support in the disposal process - freeing up vets to concentrate
on veterinary matters. A total of 1235 vets from the State Veterinary
Service are deployed in tackling the disease. We have appealed for more
vets to assist with the effort. Any vets interested in helping should call
+44 (0)20 7904 6472.
Independent research on how the disease might spread has been published.
They confirm the government's view that the outbreak will last to June or
July and that movement restrictions and culling animals on infected farms
are the most effective control measures.
