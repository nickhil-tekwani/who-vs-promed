The discovery of FMD in the northern Chui region of Kyrgyzstan late last
week has led to the closure of cattle markets and the implementation of an
initial 21-day quarantine period. "We have announced a quarantine in Chui
oblast. Currently, we have this disease registered in 3 districts of Osh
region, 2 districts in Djalal-Abad region and 3 districts of Chui region,"
Esenbai Seitov said. He added that more than 500 cattle were now infected
with the disease throughout Kyrgyzstan. Unofficial estimates put the figure
at several times higher.
The disease is spreading due to market economics. "Many people are bringing
infected cattle into Chui oblast because at the bazaars, the prices are
higher. We are trying to stop the movement of cattle in and out of this
region and introduce quarantine measures," Seitov added. Tackling the
disease is also being hampered by a lack of enforcement of veterinary
standards as well as a lack of specialists and a shortage of vaccine.
Officials are concerned that the lack of resources needed to contain the
disease will lead to its spread. "We do not have enough vaccine. Ideally,
we need to vaccinate cows, sheep and pigs, but now we can only do cows. So
we are expecting a rise in the disease soon," Seitov said.
