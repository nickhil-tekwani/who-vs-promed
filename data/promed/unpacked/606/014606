THE EYES HAVE IT, Apr. 25/98, New Scientist, Jonathan Knight
A skin sample taken from a living sheep's eyelid can reveal whether it will
develop the deadly disease scrapie and a similar test may also help spot
cattle with mad cow disease before they show symptoms. The story noted
that a related test for scrapie was already under development but this
test, from a Dutch team (New Scientist, print edition, 15 June 1996, p 5),
involved extracting sheep's tonsils under a general anaesthetic and has to
be done by a veterinary surgeon. The new test is simpler and cheaper. The
article said that the eye is anaesthetised with a spray and a
half-centimetre fold of skin is clipped from the surface of the inner
eyelid, or nictitating membrane. The samples are tested for PrP, a protein
known to accumulate in an abnormal form in the brain and parts of the
lymphatic system, such as the spleen and tonsils, in animals with scrapie,
BSE and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
Katherine O'Rourke and Donald Knowles of the US Department of Agriculture's
Agricultural Research Service in Pullman, Washington, have discovered that
PrP also accumulates in lymphatic tissue of the inner eyelid of sheep
incubating scrapie. This structure is present in sheep, cows and some other
mammals but not in people. The researchers took samples from about 100
sheep and tested for PrP using a monoclonal antibody that binds tightly to
the protein. Around a third of the sheep came from flocks known to harbour
scrapie. One year later, 10 per cent of the animals had developed symptoms
of the disease. All of these had tested positive for PrP, while none of the
sheep that tested negative developed the disease.
The article stated that sheep farmers in the US could be using the new test
within a year. Currently, flocks suspected of harbouring scrapie must be
quarantined and are put under surveillance for between five and six years.
Paul Rodgers, director of animal health with the American Sheep Industry
Association in Christiansburg, Virginia said, "That's very cumbersome and
expensive." The eyelid test may make it possible to destroy
scrapie-infected sheep before they have a chance to spread the infection.
"We think it's going to be one of the important tools in the eradication of
scrapie," said Rodgers.
The article continued saying British officials would like to eradicate both
scrapie and BSE. Jeffrey Almond of the University of Reading, a member of
the government's Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, said he
wants to know whether the eyelid test also works in cows, and whether it
could identify animals with prion diseases several years before they
develop symptoms.
Knowles said his group has recently detected PrP in samples from sheep less
than one year old, which suggests that it may provide accurate early
diagnosis. He also hoped to try the test on British cattle to see if it can
predict which animals will develop BSE.

SCRAPIE TEST SHOWS PROMISE, Apr. 23/98, Manitoba Co-operator, Jim Romahn
In a related article, it was reported that sheep farmers are happy that
researchers are developing new tests that can identify scrapie disease.
Kelly Maloney of the Ontario Sheep Marketing Agency, based in Guelph, said,
"It's very good news." The article said that if the research tests prove
practical, it will give farmers the tool they need to eradicate a disease
that has been a major plague. Until now, there has been no accurate test to
diagnose scrapie while sheep are still alive, so it has been next to
impossible to get rid of the disease once it shows up in a flock. That's
why the popular approach has been to slaughter the entire flock and start
over again but that's an approach that has wiped out valuable breeding
stock, not to mention the livelihood of many shepherds.
Maloney said there are promising results from two quite different
approaches. One was under way at the University of Toronto but is still a
long way from producing a practical test for farmers and the other has been
announced by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who hailed it as a
major advance for the sheep industry.
Glickman said the test is relatively cheap and easy to perform and said it
"will allow producers and veterinarians, for the first time, to easily
detect scrapie in sheep before the animals show signs of the disease. Until
now, scrapie could only be confirmed by examining the brains of dead
animals. Clearly, this is an important step toward controlling this
disease." The article noted that there is no cure or treatment for scrapie
and scientists do not fully understand how it is transmitted among sheep
and goats. Sheep can harbor the disease for up to five years before they
show signs such as trembling, incoordination or scraping against objects.
The story went on to say that both U.S. and Canadian government officials
will quarantine a flock that is believed to be infected with scrapie but
because there has been no reliable test for live animals, it has been hard
to determine when and if a quarantine should be lifted. One of the results
has been a reluctance among farmers to report scrapie symptoms. That, in
turn, has made it more difficult to prevent the disease from spreading.
USDA estimated that the new eyelid test will be performed for about $25 per
animal once it is commercially available. Current tests require biopsies of
internal organs, which is more risky and can cost up to $500 per animal.
In developing the test, researchers at USDA's Agricultural Research Service
designed a new antibody to identify prions in a sample of eyelid tissue.
USDA has applied for patents on both discoveries.
