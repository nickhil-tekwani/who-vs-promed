Investigations by the State Veterinary Institute in Olomouc confirmed the presence of the Aujeszky's virus [pseudorabies] in a dead Labrador retriever.

This virus is relatively widespread in feral pigs. The State Veterinary Administration (SVS) reiterates that hunters must try to prevent their dogs from coming into direct contact with wild boar, and certainly refrain from feeding them with their raw meat and offal. The disease is not treatable and is fatal for dogs.

In this particular case, the owner noticed neurological signs typical of Aujeszky's disease in his dog, which had come into contact with wild pigs at the end of last year [2015]. The owner requested the post mortem examination and laboratory testing of his dead dog.

The last case of Aujeszky's disease in domestic pigs in the Czech Republic took place in a backyard holding in Nova Ves district, Benesov in March 2004. The pigs had been infected from wild boar.

In 2013, the Czech Republic completed several years of monitoring for the presence of antibodies against the virus in feral pigs. The results showed that, as an average, 1/3 of the wild boar were positive.

Herpesvirus infection is characterized by the possibility of latency and it is, therefore, very difficult to determine the actual amount of virus shedders.

During 2014, 2 Aujeszky's disease cases were confirmed in dogs; no cases were reported during 2015.

[The following summary of Aujeszky's disease is derived from chapter 2.1.2 in OIE's Terrestrial Manual (updated 2012):

"Aujeszky's disease, also known as pseudorabies, is caused by an alphaherpesvirus that infects the central nervous system and other organs, such as the respiratory tract, in a variety of mammals except humans and the tailless apes. It is associated primarily with pigs, the natural host, which remain latently infected following clinical recovery (except piglets under 2 weeks old, which die from encephalitis). The disease is controlled by containment of infected herds and by the use of vaccines and/or removal of latently infected animals.

A diagnosis of Aujeszky's disease is established by detecting the agent (virus isolation, polymerase chain reaction [PCR]), as well as by detecting a serological response in the live animal."
