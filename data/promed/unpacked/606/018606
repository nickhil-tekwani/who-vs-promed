Antimicrobial-resistant typhoid is spreading across Africa and Asia and poses a major global health threat, warn experts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Researchers from the Wellcome Trust, who have been tracking the hard-to-treat infection, say it is replacing regular typhoid in many countries. They analyzed bacterial samples from 63 countries, nearly half were resistant to standard antimicrobial treatments. Over-reliance on these drugs is to blame, they say in Nature Genetics.

Increasingly, doctors now need to use other, more expensive and less readily available antimicrobial agents to treat typhoid fever, a disease that kills around 200 000 people each year.

The Wellcome Trust work is the largest snapshot of what is happening globally to typhoid resistance. It shows the problem is widespread.

In many parts of Asia and Africa, where typhoid is endemic, a multidrug-resistant strain of typhoid called H58 has displaced other typhoid strains that have been around for centuries. Of the 63 countries the researchers looked at, 21 had H58.

Dr Kathryn Holt, from the University of Melbourne and one of the study authors, said H58 was gaining a firm foothold. "Multidrug-resistant typhoid has been coming and going since the 1970s and is caused by the bacteria picking up novel antimicrobial resistance genes, which are usually lost when we switch to a new drug. In H58, these genes are becoming a stable part of the genome, which means multiple-antibiotic resistant typhoid is here to stay."

A third of the world's population is at risk of getting typhoid. It is caused by the contagious bacterium _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhi, spread from person to person by food and water that is contaminated with traces of feces containing the organism. Improved water, sanitation, and hygiene could dramatically cut the number of infections, but the investment needed to do this may be our of reach for many developing countries.

There are vaccines against typhoid, but they are not available in all parts of the world, nor are they 100 percent protective.

Abstract
--------
"The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) typhoid is a major global health threat affecting many countries where the disease is endemic. Here whole-genome sequence analysis of 1832 _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhi (_S._ Typhi) identifies a single dominant MDR lineage, H58, which has emerged and spread throughout Asia and Africa over the last 30 years. Our analysis identifies numerous transmissions of H58, including multiple transfers from Asia to Africa and an ongoing, unrecognized MDR epidemic within Africa itself. Notably, our analysis indicates that H58 lineages are displacing antimicrobial-sensitive isolates, transforming the global population structure of this pathogen. H58 isolates can harbor a complex MDR element residing either on transmissible IncHI1 plasmids or within multiple chromosomal integration sites. We also identify new mutations that define the H58 lineage. This phylogeographical analysis provides a framework to facilitate global management of MDR typhoid and is applicable to similar MDR lineages emerging in other bacterial species." - Mod.LL]
