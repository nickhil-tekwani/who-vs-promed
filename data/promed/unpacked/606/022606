CUTANEOUS ABSCESSES - MIDDLE EAST EX FIJI: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

I was wondering whether there is any endemic cause for large boils in
Fijians? I have noted about a dozen individuals traveling to the Middle
East to work on contracts there who show up with a large number of small
ones and a few very large ones. Lab facilities for testing are almost
nonexistent where we are.

[ProMED would appreciate any information regarding the submitter's
question. It would be important to know whether the processes were present
in Fiji, whether others in contact with the index cases had similar
lesions, and, if not and acquired en route to the Middle East, whether the
affected individuals had any common exposure. Certainly, _Staphylococcus
aureus_ ought to be high on the list - Mod.LL]
