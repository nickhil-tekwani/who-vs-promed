Disease and Vesicular Stomatitis - Epidemiological Reports, 1999

The Week 38 (ending 25 Sep 1999) report was snail-mailed out on 13 Oct 1999
& shows 4 foci of equine encephalitis in Colombia & one in Venezuela near
Maracay, 450 km from the focus on the Colombian border. Colombia has
reported cases practically every week during 1999, but Venezuela only
occasionally if at all.
The Week 39 (ending 2 Oct 1999) report, mailed on 18 Oct, shows cases
persisting for a third week in the coastal zone of Cartagena &
Barranquilla, Colombia, but no new cases in Venezuela.
The web address of the statistics of livestock disease in Colombia is:
<http://www.iicasaninet.net/vilgilmo/Reportica.htm> [in Spanish
Select "Otras enfermedades en campana" which has data on equine
encephalitis (cases confimed by laboratory are reported as EEV or EEE --
Venezuelan or Eastern equine encephalitis).
As of 2 Oct 1999 there have been 18 Departments affected by 60 episodes,
with 8 (in 4 Departments) diagnosed as Venezuelan equine encephalitis &
none as Eastern equine encephalitis.
Totals for the same period in 1998 were 217, including 33 laboratory
diagnosed as VEE & 2 as EEE, showing that this year the viruses are
apparently much less active than last.
