New finding of Tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus in France
------------------------------------------------------------
Tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus [TYLCV] (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) was
found in 1999 in 2 tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_) fields in the south
east (departments of Gard and Bouches-du-Rhone). The disease was eradicated
in 2000 (see EPPO RS 2000/094 and 2000/168). In July 2002, TYLCV was
detected in tomatoes grown under plastic tunnels in the municipality of
Eygalieres (Bouches-du-Rhone). Tomato plants in the infested tunnels were
destroyed and an area of compulsory control was defined around the infested
place. No TYLCV was detected in surveys conducted in other plastic tunnels
at the production site or at nearby farms.
The outbreak might have originated from infected tomato plants imported
from Spain. Monitoring will continue. Compulsory control of TYLCV, cucurbit
yellow stunting disorder crinivirus (EPPO Alert List), tomato chlorosis
crinivirus (EPPO Alert List), tomato infectious chlorosis crinivirus (EPPO
Alert List), and cucumber vein yellowing ipomovirus (EPPO Alert List) has
been in force in France since July 2002.

[TYLCV is a complex of many strains and occurs mainly in tropical and
subtropical regions of the world. It causes severe crop losses (up to 100
per cent) in tomato and other solanaceous hosts (pepper [_Capsicum annum_
and _C. chinense_] and bean [_Phaseolus vulgaris_]). The virus is present
in most Mediterranean countries and parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia,
Japan, Australia, Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean Islands, and some
south eastern states in the USA. Disease management involves keeping
populations of the vector (_Bemisia tabaci_) under control by chemical
sprays and by
eradicating volunteer tomato plants and susceptible weeds.
The first outbreak of TYLCV in France in 1999 appears to have occurred as a
result of the importation of TYLCV infected tomato plantlets from Almeria,
Spain. Rigorous monitoring of transplant imports will be required to
prevent other introductions of the virus into France.
