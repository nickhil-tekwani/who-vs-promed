Key points
----------
Current week (24) [14-20 Jun 2021] / Cumulative 2021 week 1-24 / Cumulative 2020 week 1-24
- Suspected cases: 70 / 2167 / 5079
- Confirmed cases: 6 / 32 / 1031
- Probable cases: 0 / 3 / 14
- Deaths: 2 / 62 / 214
- Case fatality rate (CFR [%): 33.3 / 20.5 / 20.8
- Number of states affected: 2 / 14 / 27
- Local government areas (LGAs) affected: 6 / 58 / 129

Highlights
----------
- In week 24, the number of new confirmed cases decreased from 4 in week 23 2021 to 6 cases. These were reported from Edo and Ondo States (Table 3).
- Cumulatively from week 1 to week 24, 2021, 62 deaths have been reported with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 20.5% which is lower than the CFR for the same period in 2020 (20.8%)
- In total for 2021, 14 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 58 Local Government Areas (Figure 2 and 3).
- Of all confirmed cases, 80% are from Edo (44%), Ondo (30%), and Taraba (6%) states.
- The predominant age group affected is 21-30 years (Range: <1 to 70 years, median Age: 29 years) . The male to female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:0.8 (Figure 4).
- The number of suspected cases has decreased compared to that reported for the same period in 2020.
- No new Health care worker affected in the reporting week 24.
- National Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Technical Working Group (TWG) continues to coordinate the response activities at all levels.

Response activities
-------------------
- Conducted 2021 Lassa fever high-burden states preparedness/response engagement meeting.
- Lassa fever alert letters sent to states.
- The National Emergency Operations Centre alert mode activated 2021 for effective multi-sectoral, multi-disciplinary coordination of Lassa fever response.
- State Public Health Emergency Operations Centre activated in affected states.
- The 5 Lassa fever molecular laboratories in the NCDC network are working at full capacity to ensure that all samples are tested and results provided within the shortest turnaround time.
- Confirmed cases are treated at identified treatment centres across the states.
- Dissemination of reviewed case management and safe burial practices guidelines.
- Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies.
- Implementation of Lassa fever environmental response campaign in high-burden states by Federal Ministry of Environment.
- Deployment of National Rapid Respond Teams to 3 states to support Lassa fever response.

Notes on this report
--------------------
Data source
-----------
Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the national Lassa fever emergency operations centre.

Case definitions
----------------
- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and either
a. history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents;
b. history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms; or
c. any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhage

- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation)

- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing

- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever

Calculations
------------
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

[There were 6 new confirmed and 70 new suspected cases in week 24 (14-20 Jun 2021), indicating that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing but declining. The graph in Figure 6 indicates that a peak of cases occurred in week 7 last year (10-16 Feb 2020). There are now 2 deaths among the confirmed cases for week 24 of 2021. Fortunately, there are no newly infected healthcare workers during the current week (week 24).

The report above confirms that, so far this year (2021), Edo, Ondo, Taraba, and Ebonyi states have the most confirmed cases. The number of states affected remained the same at 14, and the number of local government areas (LGAs) with at least one case increased from 57 to 58. Nigeria may now be entering the period of case decline. The peak is not as high so far this year (2021) as in previous years, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6. There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March) over the past 4 years and will be the case again for the year 2021 but at a lower level.

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It is encouraging to learn that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta. One hopes that this is why there are fewer cases this year (2021).
