Panama: Case of Hantavirus Infection Reported in Los Santos Province
---------------------------------------------------
The first case of hantavirus infection for 2003 was reported by the
Ministry of Health (MINSA) in the foothills of Canajagua, in Las Tablas,
Los Santos Province. The Director of Health, Fernando Gracia, said that the
patient is a 44-year-old farmer who presented with typical symptoms
suggestive of the disease such as fever, chills, and difficulty in
breathing. The patient is interned in the Intensive Care Unit in the
Joaquin Pablo Franco hospital in Las Tablas (assisted by a respiratory
ventilator) .
The diagnosis was confirmed as due to a hantavirus infection by the Gorgas
Commemorative Institute. Gracia mentioned that a team from the Institution
of Scientific Investigations and another from MINSA was immediately sent to
the region, in order to conduct a "perifocal" study to evaluate and
determine if there are other cases in family members or neighbors of the
affected individual. During this study they will take blood specimens and
revise the sanitary norms existing in the area.
The Minster pointed out that [hantavirus-associated disease is now endemic
in Panama and cases can be expected to occur at intervals]. He indicated
that it is necessary that residents of the regions that are prone to the
disease take preventive measures: have clean patios, avoid sowing the land
near the houses, and above all not to have contact with [rodents].
[As of March 2003, there has been a total of] 6 deaths reported
attributable to hantavirus infection; 5 of these were in 2000, and one in 2001.

[Several species of hantavirus may be present in Panama. It is not possible
to deduce the identity of the pathogen from this report. Previously, 2
hantaviruses have been isolated in Panama: Choclo virus (reservoir host
_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_) and Calabazo virus (reservoir host _Zygodontomys
brevicauda_). Only the former has been associated with hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome (see: Vincent et al., Virology 277:14-19, 2000). Further
information on the identity of the hantavirus and rodent reservoir
implicated in the current outbreak would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
