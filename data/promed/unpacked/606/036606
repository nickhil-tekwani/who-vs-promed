Viet Nam: deaths of 5 children attributed to avian influenza H5 virus
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The deaths of 5 children, from the beginning of August 2004 to Thu 9
Sep 2004, are possibly attributable to infection with the H5 subtype
of avian influenza A virus, said doctors at Hanoi's Central
Pediatrics Hospital. The victims, aged between 14 months and 4 years,
lived in Hanoi, and in the neighboring province of Ha Tay, and were
hospitalized on suspicion of having contracted bird flu. All were in
critical condition, suffering from labored breathing, high fever, and
internal bleeding.
The Ministry of Health also announced that there have been 27 cases
suspected of contracting the deadly H5N1 virus since the beginning of
this year [2004]. Of those, 20 have been confirmed to have died as a
result of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection.
No new cases of H5N1 infection in humans have been found nationwide
since the beginning of September 2004, the Ministry stated. Health
workers, however, warned that residents should be on high alert, as
avian influenza A (H5N1) virus in poultry has not been completely
eradicated, although it has reportedly been under control since July
2004.
The virus has wiped out 17 percent of the country's fowl population,
totaling 43.2 million poultry across 57 of 64 localities, causing
losses of VND 1.3 trillion (USD 83.3 million) between late last year
[2003] and March of this year [2004]. It killed a further 21 173
chickens, and 1153 ducks and geese, in 18 poultry farming bases, in 8
southern provinces, during the 2nd outbreak in early July 2004. The
local authorities now admit that it may take at least 5 years to
completely eradicate bird flu from Viet Nam.

[According to the WHO, as of 7 Sep 2004, there have been a total of
27 confirmed cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection of
humans in Viet Nam, 20 of whom have died. These figures include one
fatal case, which occurred in Viet Nam in mid-March [2004], but which
has only recently been officially confirmed. They also include 4
recent cases, all fatal, reported from Viet Nam since early August
[2004]. Of these 4 cases, 3 have been confirmed as caused by the H5N1
strain. For the remaining case, infection with influenza A H5 subtype
has been laboratory confirmed. It is not clear whether the 5
suspected cases described above are included in these totals, or
whether they are additional.
Detection of an H5 subtype of influenza A in a human should always
arouse a very high level of suspicion that the case was caused by the
H5N1 strain of avian influenza, particularly in a country with
ongoing outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry. H5N1 is the only strain within
the H5 subtype that has ever been shown to cause disease in humans. -
