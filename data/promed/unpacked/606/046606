Democratic Republic of the Congo: Measles outbreak in northern Katanga
------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a measles outbreak in Malemba-Nkulu territory in northern
Katanga region in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It is
affecting more than 10 villages. Around 3500 cases [have been]
recorded in last couple of weeks [20 May - 1 Jun 2007] and more than
150 children have died so far.
Doctors Worldwide (DWW) has set up 4 emergency medical teams to send
to the area. Transport is very difficult particularly after heavy
rains in recent weeks. We are co-coordinating help with WHO, OCHA and
local government. The following actions have been taken; four kits of
medical supplies have been bought and will be [used] by 4 teams in 4
villages, and expect to cover at least 800 children for one month:
that is about 200 children per team. All sick children will be
treated free of charge. DWW will distribute 6 bicycles in different
villages. The bicycles will help nurses to collect vaccines from
Malemba city and organize an immunization campaign up to 95 km [59
miles] from Malemba.
The World Health Organization (WHO) will provide transport of
medicines by special flight (AIR SERV), and its departure is planned
for Saturday (02 June 2007). The government, through the medical
officer of the district, will provide a 4X4 pickup from Kamina to
Malemba-Nkulu, and DWW will provide diesel. This vehicle [will start]
to bring vaccines from EPI Kamina office tomorrow and will [reach]
Malemba during the weekend to work together with DWW delegation. All
teams will use the existing public facilities or private houses as
contributions from local community.
DWW is planning to set up a social mobilization and health promotion
campaign to encourage parents to use the treatment centres which will
be located separately at:
- Muko-Mutombo (in Malemba city close to the DWW/RADEM maternity building);
- Lubinda village, at 65 km [40.4 miles] from Malemba city, in
Ngoy-mani area, at 6 km [3.73 miles] from Kimbalama village where DWW
is building a 2nd maternity;
- Kabumbulu village, at 50 km [31 miles] from Malemba city on the
Congo river; and
- Lwamba village, at 75 km [46.6 miles] from Malemba city.

[The high death toll in this outbreak reflects the magnitude of the
problem of containing measles in the heart of the African continent.
