I want to correct a statement made by Dr. Donoghue in her ProMED-mail
message of yesterday. Horses are not susceptible to foot and mouth disease
(FMD) viruses but they are susceptible to vesicular stomatitis viruses. In
fact, the most common differential in the U.S. for vesicular-type lesions
in horses are plant awns acquired from forage such as fescue.
