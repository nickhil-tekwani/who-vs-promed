Almost 20 years before SARS-CoV-2, a related and even more lethal coronavirus sowed panic, killing nearly 10% of the 8000 people who became infected. But the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) may have left some survivors with a gift. Former SARS patients who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 appear able to fend off all variants of SARS-CoV-2 in circulation, as well as ones that may soon emerge, a new study suggests. Their formidable antibodies may even protect against coronaviruses in other species that have yet to make the jump into humans--and may hold clues to how to make a so-called pancoronavirus vaccine that could forestall future outbreaks.

A team led by emerging disease specialist Linfa Wang from Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore identified 8 SARS survivors who recently received 2 shots of a messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccine. In the test tube, antibodies sieved from their blood potently "neutralized" an early strain of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV, the virus that caused SARS, Wang and colleagues report today [18 Aug 2021] in The New England Journal of Medicine [see citation below]. The team further found these neutralizing antibodies worked well against the alpha, beta, and delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 and stymied 5 related coronaviruses found in bats and pangolins that potentially could infect humans.

This study's demonstration of broad-spectrum immunity against sarbecoviruses--a subset of coronaviruses that includes the causes of SARS and COVID-19--is "amazing and very good news," says Priyamvada Acharya, a structural biologist at Duke University who works on pancoronavirus vaccine research and was not involved in the new study. "This paper provides a proof of principle that a pansarbecovirus vaccine is possible." It also marks an important step toward a long-term hope--a vaccine that works against all coronaviruses--several researchers trying to develop this dreamed-of protection say.

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are about 80% identical, and both initiate infections when their surface protein spike binds to the human cellular receptor known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). So Wang was surprised this year [2021] when other researchers reported that people who had recovered from SARS retained antibodies that could prevent SARS-CoV from binding to the ACE2 receptor, but didn't seem to have any power against SARS-CoV-2. "It was always in the back of my mind that the 2 viruses bind to the same receptor, so why don't [these people's antibodies] cross neutralize?" he wondered.

The immune system's B cells make a potpourri of antibodies against any virus, but lab tests typically measure the presence of the most abundant ones. Maybe SARS survivors harbored a population of B cells that recognized both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 but were in the minority and difficult to see, Wang reasoned. If so, he thought, a COVID-19 vaccine might bolster the population of those double-action B cells, and broaden survivors' immunity.

To test that possibility, Wang's team compared neutralizing antibodies from the vaccinated SARS survivors--all health-care workers in Singapore--with those from SARS patients who had not received a COVID-19 vaccine. Wang's team also analyzed antibodies in 3 other groups: unvaccinated people who currently had COVID-19, along with vaccinated people who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 or had never been infected with that virus.

The vaccinated SARS survivors were the only cohort whose antibodies neutralized 10 different coronaviruses, according to a new assay Wang's team developed that tests the antibodies' ability to block binding between ACE2 and the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of different spikes. And the levels of the neutralizing antibodies were relatively high against each one. "It's super interesting," says Neil King, a biomedical engineer at the University of Washington, Seattle, who is also working on pancoronavirus vaccines. "It may lead people to reprioritize their efforts."

Several groups working on pancoronavirus vaccines are combining spikes or just the key RBDs from 8 or more different viruses. But the new work suggests a combination of just 2 may be enough to reach a less ambitious goal, protecting against all sarbecoviruses. Then again, Wang has yet to identify why these antibodies work so well, which is critical to designing vaccines, because the RBDs themselves likely will not trigger production of the wanted immune response. The design of what are known as immunogens will require a complicated structural biology analysis, now underway in his group, that can determine precisely where they bind to the RBDs. That information, in turn, might allow researchers to reverse engineer the parts of spike that trigger production of these antibodies.

For a booster shot against possible SARS-CoV-2 variants or a pansarbecovirus vaccine, Wang suggests the best immunogens would combine common regions of SARS-CoV and the SARS-related viruses from pangolins and bats. "We want the vaccine to be as far away as possible from SARS-CoV-2, so that you really get the human immune system to work out only the common neutralizing antibody," he says.

In parallel with the vaccine work, the lab has also isolated several individual antibodies from the COVID-19-vaccinated SARS survivors that are "much more potent" against SARS-CoV-2 than anything described by other groups. Made in quantity in the lab, those monoclonal antibodies could play a critical role in future outbreaks, Wang thinks. "We are going to produce a cocktail of a dozen monoclonal antibodies that neutralize all the different sarbecoviruses and are ready to fight the next pandemic," he says. "If we are unfortunate enough to have a SARS-3 down the line, we'll already have a therapeutic cocktail ready to go."

Andrew Ward, a structural biologist at Scripps Research who is developing pancoronavirus vaccines, calls the results from Wang's team "pretty cool," although he isn't surprised that immunity to both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 may generate a broader sarbecovirus shield. He is just as impressed that the study could even be done. Blood from the few SARS survivors is "a unique resource that is hard to come by," he says.

The combination of access to the SARS survivors in Singapore, which had the 5th-highest number of cases of any country, and the new assay made this study possible, according to Wang. "No other lab could do this right now," he says.

[2] US: booster vaccination
Date: Wed 18 Aug 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/08/us-covid-19-vaccine-booster-program-begin-sep-20


Today [Wed 18 Aug 2021] White House officials released details of their plan to deliver booster COVID-19 shots for all fully vaccinated US adults who completed their 2-dose mRNA vaccination regimen at least 8 months prior. The booster program will begin the week of 20 Sep [2021].

"It is now our clinical judgment that the time to put out a plan for boosters is now," said Vivek Murthy, MD, the US Surgeon General. "We have data that protection against moderate disease decreases over time."

Murthy said the boosters will be contingent on the Food and Drug Administration authorizing the 3rd dose.

Throughout the press briefing, officials explained new data published today [18 Aug 2021] in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, which shows the current mRNA vaccines by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech afforded waning protection against infection from March-July 2021, and decreased effectiveness as the delta (B1617.2) variant has surged to become the dominant strain in the country. [See related CIDRAP News story in [3] below.]

Murthy said he anticipates a booster will also be needed for the more than 13 million Americans who have been vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, but guidance will hinge on data expected from that company in the coming weeks.

"We are not recommending that you go out and get a booster today," he said.

Throughout today's [18 Aug 2021] press briefing, Murthy empathized that the new booster plan does not diminish 2 other goals of the administration: distributing vaccines globally and getting hesitant Americans to initiate the vaccination process.

"I do not think we have to choose between vaccinating Americans and the world, but we have to act based on the data we have," Murthy said.

Though cases across the country remain high, Jeff Zients, the head of the White House COVID-19 team, said the administration is noting an uptick in vaccination rates. In the past 2 weeks, he said, 7 million Americans got their 1st shot, the highest number since the beginning of June [2021].

And, ahead of school starting, there has been a 75% increase in the daily average of 12-15-year-olds getting vaccinated, he said. According to CNN, over the past 2 weeks, adolescents ages 12-15 account for 1/5 of all new vaccinations in the country. The share of fully vaccinated people who are ages 12-15 has risen from 21.5% in June [2021] to 32.2% in August [2021].

Zients said that, by the end of today [18 Aug 2021], 200 million Americans will have at least their 1st shot.

"This is a major milestone," he said. "Americans across the country are continuing to step up and get vaccinated."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID Data Tracker shows that 50.9% of Americans are fully vaccinated and 59.9% have at least one dose.

The United States reported 128 902 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [17 Aug 2021], and 1001 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. The 7-day average of new cases is 139 872, according to the New York Times tracker.

After weeks of warnings from health officials and steep case increases, Alabama is now officially out of intensive care unit (ICU) beds.

"We've never been here before. We are truly now in uncharted territory in terms of our ICU bed capacity," said Alabama Hospital Association President Don Williamson, MD, to a local news station. "There were 1568 patients today [17 Aug 2021] who need ICU beds, and there are only 1557 designated ICU beds in the state today [17 Aug 2021]."

Currently, 2723 people in Alabama are hospitalized for COVID-19, including 40 children. Williamson said 12% of those hospitalized for COVID-19 are fully vaccinated.

Though the worst of the summer surge is still seen in Southern states and in communities with low vaccination rates, breakthrough infections in vaccinated people accounted for at least one in 5 new cases in 6 states--California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Oregon, Utah, and Vermont--and higher percentages in total hospitalizations and deaths than had previously been observed in all of them, according to figures gathered by the New York Times.

[3] Waning immunity
Date: Wed 18 Aug 2021

A trio of new real-world US studies examine the ongoing effectiveness of 2 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines against COVID-19, one finding significantly ebbing efficacy against infection in nursing home residents and 2 showing sustained protection against coronavirus-related hospitalizations but declining coverage against new adult cases.

The studies were cited today [Wed 18 Aug 2021] as White House officials announced plans to offer booster doses of the vaccines beginning next month [Sep 2021] (see related CIDRAP News story in [2] above). They were published today in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the journal of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The results, the study authors said, underscore the need for heightened vigilance and a multipronged approach to prevent COVID-19 amid diminishing vaccine effectiveness (VE) and the ongoing surge of cases caused by the delta (B1617.2) variant.

In the 1st study, the researchers compared weekly reports of new infections by vaccination status from nursing homes certified by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to evaluate the VE of 2 doses of either mRNA vaccine before the emergence of delta (1 Mar-9 May 2021) and after (21 Jun-1 Aug 2021).

Of all nursing home residents, 14.7% were unvaccinated, 49.6% were fully vaccinated with Pfizer, 25.3% were vaccinated with Moderna, and 10.4% had "other" vaccination status.

Before delta predominated, data from 17 407 reports from 3862 nursing homes showed that adjusted VE was 74.7%. But after, it fell to 53.1%, according to 85 593 reports from 14 917 facilities.

Pre-delta, adjusted VE against infection among those fully vaccinated (vs unvaccinated) was 74.7% for either mRNA vaccine, 74.2% for Pfizer, and 74.7% for Moderna. After the emergence of delta, adjusted VE against infection among fully vaccinated residents was 53.1% for either vaccine, 52.4% for Pfizer, and 50.6% for Moderna.

A total of 6879 COVID-19 asymptomatic and symptomatic infections were identified, 30.7% of them in unvaccinated residents, 37.8% in those fully vaccinated with Pfizer, 18.9% in those fully vaccinated with Moderna, and 12.5% in residents with other vaccination status.

The researchers, who pointed out that their study couldn't differentiate between the effects of delta and falling vaccine-generated immunity, called for research into whether VE against severe disease in nursing home residents is also waning over time. Because they are typically older and frail, nursing home residents may have a less robust immune response to vaccines and are at high risk for poor COVID-19 outcomes, they added.

"Because nursing home residents might remain at some risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection despite vaccination, multiple COVID-19 prevention strategies, including rigorous attention to infection control and testing practices and vaccination of nursing home staff members, residents, and visitors, are critical," the authors wrote. "Additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine might be considered for nursing home and long-term care facility residents."

The 2nd study evaluated the duration of mRNA VE against COVID-19 hospitalization in patients 18 years and older admitted to 21 hospitals in 18 states from March-July 2021.

Of 3089 hospitalized adults (1194 COVID-19 patients and 1895 uninfected control patients), 11.8% of case-patients and 52.1% of controls had received 2 doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine 14 days or more before symptom onset (median days after 2nd dose, 65). Median patient age was 59 years, 48.7% were women, 56.7% were White, and 21.1% were immunocompromised.

2-12 weeks after the 2nd dose, VE against coronavirus-related hospitalization was 86% overall, 63% in immunocompromised patients, and 90% in those with healthy immune systems. After 13-24 weeks, VE was 84%, a nonsignificant change. Whole-genome sequencing of specimens from 454 case patients showed that 53.3% were caused by the alpha (B117) variant, and 16.3% were due to delta.

Among patients with symptom onset from March - May [2021], before delta became predominant, VE against hospitalization was 87%, falling to 84% in June and July [2021]. The results were consistent among subgroups of participants at high risk of severe COVID-19, including older adults, those with at least 3 underlying illnesses, and those with compromised immune systems.

"Effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19-associated hospitalization was sustained over a 24-week period, including among groups at higher risk for severe COVID-19; ongoing monitoring is needed as new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge," the researchers wrote.

"To reduce their risk for hospitalization, all eligible persons should be offered COVID-19 vaccination. Continued monitoring of VE against infection and severe disease is needed as the elapsed time since vaccination increases and new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge."

In the last study, the New York State Department of Health estimated rates of new adult COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations by vaccine status from 3 May-25 Jul [2021] by linking statewide immunization, testing, and hospitalization databases.

By the end of the study, 65.8% of adult New Yorkers were fully vaccinated, and 10.4% had received 1 dose. Of fully vaccinated adults, 51.3% had been given the Pfizer vaccine, 39.8% received Moderna, and 8.9% received Johnson & Johnson.

Over the study period, age-adjusted VE against COVID-related hospitalization was relatively steady, from 91.9%-95.3%. But the VE against infection fell from 91.7% to 79.8%.

Weekly VE against infection dropped in all age-groups during the study, declining from 90.6% to 74.6% in adults 18-49 years, 93.5% to 83.4% for those 50-64, and 92.3% to 88.9% for those 65 and older.

By 25 Jul [2021], 1271 fully vaccinated adults had been hospitalized with COVID-19 (0.17 per 100 000 person-days), versus 7308 (2.03) among the unvaccinated. The ratio of hospitalizations to cases was lower among the fully vaccinated than among the unvaccinated (13.1 per 100 cases and 19.0, respectively).

In general, hospitalization rates fell through the week of 5 Jul [2021] but then rose over the following 2 weeks; they were higher among those 65 and older than among younger adults, regardless of vaccination status.

The overall age-adjusted VE against hospitalization ranged from 91.9%-85.3% over the study period. VE against hospitalization stayed steady, at 90.8%-97.5% for adults 18-49 years, 92.4%-97.0% for those 50-64, and 92.3%-96.1% for those 65 and older.

By the end of the study, 9675 new infections occurred (1.31 per 100 000 person-days) in fully vaccinated adults, versus 38 505 (10.69) in the unvaccinated.

Of infections among fully vaccinated adults, 98.1% occurred 7 or more days after gaining full vaccination status (median, 85 days). New case rates among the fully vaccinated and the unvaccinated were similar across age-groups over the study period, declining in June [2021] before rising in July [2021].

While the vaccines are highly effective against hospitalization, they have become less effective amid the delta surge and easing of mask wearing and physical distancing guidelines, the authors noted.

"To reduce new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, these findings support the implementation of a layered approach centered on vaccination, as well as other prevention strategies such as masking and physical distancing," they wrote.

At a White House briefing today [Wed 18 Aug 2021], CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, said that while VE against infection is waning, protection against hospitalization remains high but that "anticipating further waning immunity and the ongoing delta surge, we are preparing for a booster vaccine."

Anthony Fauci, MD, White House chief medical advisor, added that a 3rd mRNA shot increases antibody concentrations by 10-fold or more.

A statement from the US Department of Health and Human Services today said that, depending on a Food and Drug Administration determination and a CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice's recommendation, all Americans will be offered a 3rd dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine starting the week of 20 Sep [2021] for those who received their 2nd dose 8 months before. Recommendations for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine will be based on data expected in the next few weeks.

"Our top priority remains staying ahead of the virus and protecting the American people from COVID-19 with safe, effective, and long-lasting vaccines especially in the context of a constantly changing virus and epidemiologic landscape," the statement said. "We will continue to follow the science on a daily basis, and we are prepared to modify this plan should new data emerge that requires it."
