Japanese) authored by Tadahiro Inoue and Kunio Satou.

On 14 April 2000 the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in
Japan announced the isolation of FMD virus has succeeded. In Department of
Exotic Disease Research of our Institute located in Kodaira in Tokyo the
FMD virus has been isolated in primary bovine kidney culture from the
probang sample from the cattle of the third outbreak in Miyazaki Prefecture.
The isolated virus was identified as FMD virus with detection of virus
antigen by EILSA [ELISA developed in Institute for Animal Health (IAH),
Pirbright in United Kingdom and the viral gene by RT-PCR. Our Institute is
sequencing the gene of the isolated virus.
This is the first virus isolation of FMD outbreaks in Japan. Now the third
FMD outbreak is not a suspected but real one. But the control measures for
FMD will not be changed by this isolation. Our Institute will continue to
characterize the FMD virus strain with the collaboration of IAH, Pirbright.
