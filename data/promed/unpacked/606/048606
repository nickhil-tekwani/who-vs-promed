Blue tongue may be transmitted by mosquitoes, but of that I am unaware! The
known vector of blue tongue virus is usually _Culicoides_ sp. In Africa, an
important known vector is _Culicoides pallidipennis_. The breeding of
_Culicoides_ is associated with water or wet conditions of soil/detritis,
definitely perpetuated by the rains and flooding occurring in much of the
African region. Blue tongue may also spill over into other ungulates
(besides sheep).
