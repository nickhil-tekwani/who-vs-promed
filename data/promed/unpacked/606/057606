Do I detect a little of the reluctance of the veterinary community's
reluctance to acknowledge the importance of animal (domestic or wild) faeces
as a major source of Cryptosporidium oocyts?
Although many waterborne outbreaks have involved treatment process problems,
significant deterioration of source water quality is also a frequent factor.
At the levels used in drinking water treatment, oocysts are to all intents
and purposes insenstive to chlorine disinfection, which is of course why
crypto is of such concern to the drinking water community.
I suspect that the early stab at a cause (surface water supplementation of a
proven, safe groundwater) may turn out to be not too far from the truth,
though perhaps we should all wait until the full facts are known.

[To which I replied on 27th April:
I plead guilty, BUT I have seen so many events where there has been the
apparent reactive pointing at livestock when the municipal water handling
has not been proven/demonstrated to be in order. "I am doing my job right,
it's those damn defaecating cows!" except that they use another adjective.
And then cross connections and God knows what else are found. The worst one
here was over in St Tammany parish where 9/10 municipal water & sewage
plants were out of compliance, with a long local history of fishing camps
dumping faeces straight into the river, of periurban housing using septic
tanks which were a vertical 1m wide concrete pipe filled with gravel and
over flowing into nearby streams, and leaking sewage piping. It was no
wonder that the bayou had enough E.coli to allow one to walk across dryshod.
The parish public health department blamed it on the 289 dairy farms in the
watershed and insisted that they lagoon the outflow from the milking sheds.
289 farms = ~800 votes vs >10,000 households in the 9 municipalities that
would have to fix their drains etc. And it goes on. It is an area that needs
good epidemiological field studies to quantify the actual risks.
By the way, how many oocysts does it take to get someone sick, on average?

Thanks for the reply, and also for taking the gentle chiding in the spirit
it was intended. The circumstances you describe sound pretty horrific and I
would never seek to defend such a situation.
I suppose my main aim in responding was to point up the inefficiency of
chlorine (and indeed other chemical disinfectants) against crypto. It's a
great pity, because this fairly simple technology has stood us in good stead
for the last eighty-odd years and is pretty effective. It readily kills most
pathogens, not only viruses and bacteria but also some of the protozoa
including Giardia, provided the water is treated to a reasonable condition
(turbidity & colour removal) before chlorination takes place and an
appropriate concentration is applied for sufficient contact time. Crypto is
the significant exception to the rule and has given rise to millions of
dollars of expenditure on research and upgrades to water treatment plants,
especially in the US, Canada and the UK. The most commonly adopted
technology available today usually comprises particulate removal systems
capable of removing particles in the size range of oocysts (c. 5 microns),
such as chemical coagulation, sedimentation and filtration or, increasingly,
microfiltration using synthetic membrane technology. Ozone remains a
controversial alternative chemical disinfectant with claims and counter
claims made for its efficacy.
The infective dose question is an interesting one and the answer as usual is
"it depends". At least hypothetically, a single oocyst has the potential to
infect an individual. The life cycle is fairly complex and only about 80% of
the zygotes develop into the environmentally resistant thick-walled oocysts.
Auto infection is facilitated by the remaining 20% form thin-walled oocysts
which disrupt within the intestine of the host and release the four
sporozoites to invade further host cells, without the need for further
ingestion of oocysts from the environment.
Work in the UK carried out by Moredun Research Institute and the Rhyl Lab of
the Public Health Laboratory Service confirmed the ability of single oocysts
to cause infection in gnotobiotic lambs. Another UK funded project carried
out by the Scottish Parasite Diagnostic Lab and the Kenya Trypanosomiasis
Research Institute used isolated vervet monkeys and failed to produce
illness in any age group using doses up to 100,000 oocysts. The results of
serological tests, though, suggested that the animals may have developed a
low-level infection without clinical signs of infection.
Of most interest though have been the human volunteer studies carried out in
the US (The infectivity of _C. parvum_ in healthy volunteers. Dupont HL,
Chappel CL, Sterling CR, Okhuysen PC, Rose JB & Jakubowski W. New England
Journal of Medicine, 1995, 332:(13)855-859.
Volunteers were checked for serologic evidence of past infection and then
given doses of oocysts ranging from 30 to 1 million. Excretion of oocysts
and clinical illness was monitored for a period of 8 weeks following
administration. The median infective dose was 132 oocysts, although one of 5
participants receiving 30 oocysts became ill. I believe in a later extension
to the study (but can't recall the reference), those who had become infected
in this earlier phase then could only be infected subsequently by exposure
to higher doses, supporting the widely held view that infection or exposure
to oocysts imparts a degree of immunity or at least resistance to further
infection.
Translating all this to a "what is a safe level of oocysts in treated
drinking water" is proving extremely difficult. Oocysts are regularly
recovered during monitoring and yet illness in the community served is not
detected/reported. The analytical techniques available for
environmental/water monitoring have been much improved over the last few
years but are still not wonderful. (Described as not so much looking for a
needle in a haystack but more like looking for a slightly different coloured
piece of hay in a whole field of haystacks). So, the number detected may
only loosely be related to the actual number.
I think the water industry has generally reacted to well to the developing
knowledge of this "new" pathogen, but unfortunately the remedies are
expensive. While not arguing that we shouldn't carry out the improvements to
our systems, I think it's as well to remember the contribution of waterborne
illness to the total gastrointestinal disease burden in developed countries
like yours and mine is minimal. Why we chlorinate our drinking water but
choose not to irradiate our poultry I've never really understood, but that's
another debate.
