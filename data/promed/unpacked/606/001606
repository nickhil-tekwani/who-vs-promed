MANATEE DEATHS, RED TIDE - USA (FLORIDA)

Over the past 2 weeks, 26 manatee carcasses have been found in Lee County.
Of the 4 recently reported carcasses in western Lee County, 3 have
been recovered, according to Sara McDonald of Florida Fish and
Wildlife Conservation Commission. The 4th was verified this morning.
Toxin results from one rescued manatee that died last week revealed
exposure to red tide as the cause of death, she said.

[There is a fairly long history of these outbreaks, particularly in,
but not limited to Florida. In the previous report, my fellow
moderator MHJ referred his comments to our most knowledgeable
colleague/moderator on this subject Mod.TG, who in turn wrote: (see
ProMED-mail, Red tide - USA (FL) (02): manatee deaths 20050311.0722)
"Red tide is caused by several toxic algae. Depending upon the toxin,
it is also known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), because it
causes shellfish to be toxic for consumption.
PSP is a significant problem in several geographic areas, especially
in both the east and the west coasts of the U.S. Produced by several
closely related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are
responsible for persistent problems due to their accumulation in
filter-feeding shellfish; but they also move through the food chain,
affecting zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, and even birds and
marine mammals.
_Alexandrium_ blooms generally do not involve large-cell
accumulations that discolor the water and may instead be invisible
below the water surface. Low-density populations can cause severe
problems due to the high potency of the toxins produced. Furthermore,
_Alexandrium_ spp. can grow in relatively pristine waters, and it is
difficult to argue that anthropogenic nutrient inputs are stimulating
the blooms. These characteristics are important when considering
mitigation and control strategies.
Often PSP is associated with red tides or algal blooms. Red tide is
caused by an organism called _Karenia brevis_, which in high
concentration can make the water look red. The organism releases a
toxin that paralyzes the respiratory system of fish and other marine
life.
Airborne toxins, water spray, and splashes in an outbreak have kept
people from beaches while leaving others with irritated eyes and
throats. Red tide irritates the skin of people exposed to it and can
cause itchy eyes, scratchy throats, and coughs. Harvesting from
affected areas for personal consumption is discouraged. Red tide
poisoning symptoms include nausea and dizziness and may last for
several days.
Previously the organism causing red tide was known as _Gymnodinium
breve_, but it has been reclassified in the taxonomy of
dinoflagellates. Its new name is _Karenia brevis_, or _K. brevis_.
Karenia was chosen in honor of Dr. Karen Steidinger, a prominent red
tide scientist from the Florida Marine Research Institute in St.
Petersburg, FL. The red tide update website is at
