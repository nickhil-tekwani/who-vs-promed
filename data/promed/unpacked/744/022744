State health officials investigating a hepatitis A outbreak in southeast Michigan reported [Thu 26 Oct 2107], a concerning increase in cases among men who have sex with men. So far in October 2017, there have been 11 such cases, compared to a total of 10 over the preceding 14 months. Officials are urging all men who have sex with men and others who are at risk to get vaccinated.

Since [1 Aug 2016], there have been 457 confirmed cases of hepatitis A in the city of Detroit and Ingham, Lapeer, Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, Sanilac, St Clair, Washtenaw, and Wayne counties reported to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. That figure represents a 14-fold increase in cases compared to the same period in 2014-15. 18 people have died.

No single source has been identified. "We are seeing a large person-to-person transmission. It's that not that we have one particular food source, or one specific drug" linking all the cases, said Angela Minicuci, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services.

People affected by the outbreak have ranged in age from 20-87, with a median age of 42, according to the state health department. Most of them, 63 percent, are men. About 85.6 percent of the cases involved hospitalizations. Among men who have sex with men, the hospitalization rate is higher -- 95.2 percent -- and the median age is 38.

State health officials said all men who have sex with men should get vaccinated, the same guidance provided by the national Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. "Despite this guidance, hepatitis A vaccination coverage among (men who have sex with men) in the United States remains low leaving many adult men unprotected. There are currently multiple hepatitis A outbreaks among (men who have sex with men) in the United States and Western European countries," reads a press release from the state health department.

In the overall outbreak, 48 percent percent of patients reported illicit drug use, 27.5 percent were co-infected with hepatitis C, and 3 percent were co-infected with hepatitis B. Additionally, 6% reported recent incarceration, and 7.7 percent of men reported having sex with men, according to state health officials.

In recent months, hepatitis A cases have been linked to food workers in Ann Arbor; Grosse Pointe Woods and Grosse Pointe Park; and Mt Pleasant.

The state health department has been working with local health departments to investigate cases and raise awareness about the disease and the importance of vaccinations. Those efforts include ongoing vaccination campaigns in the Macomb, Oakland, and St Clair jails, as well as in substance abuse treatment centers and homeless shelters. There are discussions about starting campaigns in the Detroit Receiving Center and the Detroit Detention Center.

Along with men who have sex with men, the following people are considered at-risk:
- health care workers who have direct contact with patients;
- people who use injection and non-injection illegal drugs;
- people who participate in commercial exchange of sexual practices;
- people who are homeless or in transient living situations;
- people who are or have recently been incarcerated;
- people who have had personal contact (such as, household, sexual) with hepatitis A patients;
- food handlers;
- people with liver diseases, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

[Last week's statistics http://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdhhs/HepA_Summ_County_SEMI2016_updated91517_601552_7.pdf showed the increase in HAV cases in Michigan's MSM cohort. Spillover into this high risk cohort was likely to occur and may fan the outbreak further.

MSM, n (percentage) *Data include only male cases
Time Period / H2 2016 / Q1 2017 / Q2 2017 / Q3 2017 / Q4 (so far) / Total
/ 1 (2.9) / 1 (2.4) / 2 (5.0) / 6 (5.0) / 11 (30.6) / 21 (7.7)

Individuals who acquired HAV but are not in the homeless or illicit drug use cohort remain about a 1/3 of the total. It is possible that acquisition was related to ingestion of food prepared by asymptomatic or symptomatic food handlers. San Diego county has suggested HAV vaccination for food handlers. This should be considered in eastern Michigan, and seems rational to be a nationwide requirement in those who are old enough to need not have received the vaccine as part of universal childhood immunization, which only began about a decade ago. - Mod.LL
