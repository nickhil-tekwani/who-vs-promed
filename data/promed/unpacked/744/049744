Tests have found no evidence of anthrax in samples of soil, sediment
and water at a south Wales farm where 2 cows died of the disease.
Anthrax was confirmed on Ynys Gau farm at Gwaelod-y-Garth, near
Cardiff, last Sunday after 2 of 6 dead cattle were shown to be infected.
Restrictions remain in places around Ynys Gau farm. But the Welsh
Assembly Government said negative results in the latest tests
indicated the risk to animals was low. Restrictions on land and
livestock may be lifted if there are no more cases. Consideration
will be given to the lifting of any restrictions on the livestock and
land should no further cases occur. [Usually this is 14-21 days after
herd vaccination or last known case. While it is not reported one
might presume that the herd has been vaccinated. - Mod.MHJ]
Environment Minister Carwyn Jones had said last week that vets
believed a pool was the source of the anthrax on the farm. Officials
also said they thought the outbreak was linked to a similar positive
anthrax test at the same farm 35 years ago.
Since the latest case was confirmed, the farm has remained sealed
off, with footpaths shut and the dead cows' carcasses incinerated.
The Health Protection Agency said it had now found no evidence of
anthrax in any of the 15 environmental samples it took from locations
considered the most likely sources of infection.
In a statement, the assembly government said: "It is impossible to
pinpoint the specific location in the risk area that led to the
cattle becoming infected. These negative results will be used to
advise the farmer on animal health measures, and taking action as
appropriate should any further cases occur."
"Monitoring of the remaining stock will continue. Consideration will
be given to the lifting of any restrictions on the livestock and land
should no further cases occur. Public health concerns have been
carefully considered and implications are minimal. The main risk is
to the farmer from direct contact with infected animals. He has been
given appropriate advice," it went on.
The risk to users of the local river was described as "negligible,"
while the danger to walkers and their paths after restrictions were
lifted would be "minimal." The statement said: "Consequently, once we
are certain that the infection is no longer present in the stock, we
will consider lifting the restrictions on the rights of way. As
illness in humans is usually caused by direct contact with diseased
animals, it is unlikely that any persons using the public rights of
way would be exposed to the infection. The possibility of infection
through inhalation or ingestion of the spores is even more remote and
does not present a risk in these circumstances."
This is the 1st case of anthrax in Britain since a cow died on a farm
in Wrexham 4 years ago.

[This rabbiting on about negligible risks to humans is very necessary
in this day and age, but to us who know the disease it seems a bit
over the top. I once was taken on as a consultant by a lawyer -- I
will not say where -- who, without consulting me first privately,
started his public questioning on behalf of the new owner of a
property, where anthrax broke out soon after the ink was dry on the
sale documents, on the basis that merely opening the farm gate put
one at lethal risk. He was unhappy to say the least when I told the
court that it takes some effort to find the spores in soil and the
number of verified cases of human anthrax from direct access to
contaminated soil can be counted on the fingers of one hand, clenched.
Russian statistics claim otherwise, but this comes from criminal
investigations of outbreaks into the non-reporting of livestock
cases. Saying that you were "hoeing a field and developed a cutaneous
lesion" is the excuse given when someone had been butchering the dead
animal which now is nowhere to be seen and the meat has been sold in
the local market and given to neighbours.
Many years ago (1972) I investigated an anthrax outbreak at Compton.
It had started with one cow death which was followed about a week
later by 3 more dead cows. The index cow died from a contaminated
Spanish mineral mix. The secondary cases were from the extravasated
blood from the 1st cow's nose; when her carcass was burnt, a small
patch of bloody soil, say 12 by 18 inches, was not dung up and burnt
with the carcass. The institute had constructed a small barbed wired
fence around the burn site, but this bloody soil patch was right at
the edge; you could see that her herd mates had found it by the wire
being bent upwards and with hair attached at that specific place,
presumably attracted by the smell and salt. We monitored it for some
6 months, finding it positive all the while. Unfortunately the
director or someone didn't like what we were doing and the fence was
removed and thus the landmarks.
Based on his time in Natal, Max Stern told me that in his experience,
surface-soil contamination would remain a risk for between 3 months
and 3 years, which is why it is a good idea to annually vaccinate
such exposed herds for 2-3 years after an outbreak. Experience has
confirmed the value of his observation.
While the cause of this Welsh outbreak is a matter of speculation and
may never be resolved, it is interesting how other events later in
the year can throw a light on a probable cause. - Mod.MHJ]
