Hospitals in many localities in Viet Nam have recorded a surge in hand-foot-mouth disease cases among children in the past month, with the number of patients in serious conditions increasing and at least one death linked to the disease. HCM City has recorded a significant increase in the number of infected children.

A mother of a 3-year-old boy in District 4 said she noticed a rash with blisters on her child's palms and mouth when she picked him up after school. Dr Du Tuan Quy, deputy head of the department, said about 25 infected children were being treated at the hospital daily, a figure 4 times higher than the previous month. Most of the serious cases are positive for Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a type of virus causing easily transmitted infection and severe complications.

As many as 14 cases are reported in the City Children's Hospital at present. Notably, 3 children are in intensive care and on ventilators. The city's Centre for Disease Control estimates that as of 15 Mar [2021], more than 2560 cases of hand-foot-mouth disease have been recorded, up 2.5 times from the same period in 2020. Between 8 Mar and 11 Mar [2021], there were 346 cases recorded among patients from all districts in the city.

The same situation has been occurring in the Central Highlands province of Dak Lak and central Khanh Hoa Province. Dak Lak Province's Centre of Disease Control reported 250 infections in the 1st 3 months of this year [2021], mainly in Buon Ma Thuot City, Buon Ho Town, and Buon Don District. In Binh Dinh Province, a 19-month-old baby died in mid-March [2021] with suspected hand-foot-mouth disease, 2 days after being taken to hospital. In Khanh Hoa Province, 244 cases have been recorded in the same period in Nha Trang City, Khanh Son, and Dien Khanh districts.

[According to the WHO, "in Viet Nam, hand-foot-mouth disease [HFMD] circulates year-round in most provinces with 2 associated peaks, March-May and September-December. Annually, about 50 000-100 000 HFMD cases are reported, including several deaths. The southern region is the most-affected area and accounts for over 60% of cases in the whole country. In 2011, Viet Nam experienced a significant increase in HFMD activity with 112 370 cases and 169 deaths reported from all 63 cities/provinces."

"Among the notifiable diseases in Viet Nam, HFMD [hand, foot and mouth disease] has been one of the top 10 causes of morbidity and mortality recently."

This current outbreak is caused by EV-71 [enterovirus-71], which was "first isolated from the faeces of a female suffering from encephalitis in 1969 in California. However, a retrospective study conducted in the Netherlands indicated that the virus could have emerged as early as 1963, a finding consistent with reports of possible worldwide EV71 epidemics in the late 20th century, throughout the world and with epidemics in Asia, Europe, and the Americas.

"EV71 virus causes a range of effects from asymptomatic infection and mild HFMD to neurological disease with severe central nervous system complications and cardiopulmonary failure. In severe cases, mortality rates can be high, especially in children aged 5 years and younger. EV71 is considered to be the most severe neurotoxic enterovirus, and severe EV71 disease has become a major public health problem in China" and apparently, Viet Nam.
