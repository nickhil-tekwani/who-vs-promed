Quarantine restrictions imposed on Njeru town council and Nyenga and
Nakisunga sub-counties in Mukono, remain in force pending control of
the foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] detected in cows there.

In June [2008], the commissioner for Livestock Health and Entomology
issued a circular banning movement of livestock, products, and
by-products from, to, and within those areas until further notice. Mr
Mukulu said animal check points have been mounted in the 3
sub-counties to enforce the restrictions, adding that arrests of
non-compliant butchers has started.

He attributed delayed control of the disease to insufficient vaccine
doses from the government. "We got only 5000 doses while the 3
sub-counties have more than 30 000 cows, and yet vaccination must
cover even the neighbouring sub-counties whose animals could have
acquired the disease," Mr Mukulu said.

[According to the data of the World Reference Laboratory (WRL) for FMD
at Pirbright, the disease is endemic in Uganda with the following
serotypes identified (in brackets, year of last occurrence): O
(2007), A (2002), C (1971), SAT1 (1999), SAT2 (2002), SAT3 (1997;
only in African buffalo).

The WRL further states that "all 3 SAT types are probably endemic in
the African buffalo population."

Uganda submitted to the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health)
its 2 semi-annual reports for the year 2007; FMD was reportedly
present, but no quantitative data were included. The last submission
of a field-collected sample to the WRL-FMD took place on 3 Jul 2008
(sampled from cattle on 24 Apr 2007). The results of the sequencing
of this strain, found to be topotype EA-2, are included in the
Molecular Epidemiology Report of 9 Aug 2007, available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2007/WRLFMD-2007-00021-Uganda-O.pdf>.
