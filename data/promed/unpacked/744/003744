In the Siberian town of Zima, as many as 61 people, including 28 children,
were being treated at hospitals after developing food-poisoning, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said. Twelve of them were diagnosed with acute
trichinosis.
According to regional health officials, an unlicensed hunter killed the
bear and smoked the meat at his farm without submitting it for a veterinary
examination. Up to 23 kg of the tainted meat was sold in Zima. Some of the
bear meat was also sold in cities of Sayansk, Angarsk and Irkutsk, and
cases of trichinosis have also been reported in those cities."
There was no mention of deaths in the report cited above.

The most likely cause is trichinosis. I have seen at least one patient and
know of others in Alaska. The diagnosis should be obvious. Myalgia, facial
edema, eosinophilia and, if you do a simple impression smear of a muscle
biopsy, the larvae. They can often be seen alive in a fresh sample but
should be HE stained and will be diagnosed by the pathologist.
Treatment with albendazole or mebendazole has been moderately effective. I
treated here in Thailand several people who got trichinosis from Laotian
poorly fried sausages at an embassy party in Laos. Half received an NSAID
and the other steroids for the myalgia and fever. The response was about
the same but numbers were small and this is only anecdotal.
Two of the victims had splinter hemorrhages under their finger nails. Look
for them in the Siberian patients. Our diplomatic epidemic subjects all
recovered fully but I know of at least one death in Alaskan natives.
About two years ago, we encountered several cases of _Trichinella
pseudospiralis_ cases in the south of Thailand. This worm lives a long time
and does not encapsulate in muscle. It is rare and only few cases have
been reported in man - one previous case from New Zealand. It will cause
long lasting myositis in man and the last case, in a botanist, was written
off as myositis and did respond to albedazole after several years of missed
diagnosis and inappropriate [therapy.

[Thanks to Don Schaffner of Rutgers University for sending in similar media
information citing trichinosis as the cause. In the United States, the
prevalence of trichinosis in swine has diminished markedly with the
institution of swine garbage feeding prohibitions. Of the relatively small
number of cases which now occur in the United States, bear meat and other
wildlife is the most common source, not swine.
The large number of hospitalization indicates fairly severe infections with
meat containing approximately 100 to 1000 larvae per gram. Infections with
less than 1 larva per gram are generally thought to be asymptomatic. Severe
infections such as this can result in death and it reminds us the origin of
meat inspection as an organized discipline was stimulated by severe
outbreaks of trichinosis killing hundreds of people at a time in German and
other European cities in the last century. Trichinosis remains a hazard of
Arctic life. - Mod.PC
