Vesicular stomatitis detected in horses on Kinney county premises
1st case in the US in 2019 [A dubious honor - Mod.TG]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was confirmed in horses on a Kinney county premises on [21 Jun 2019]. The National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) confirmed the virus as the Indiana serotype.

The horses were tested after the owner observed lesions on the horses' muzzles and contacted a veterinary practitioner. TAHC has quarantined the premises, and there is no known exposure to other horses. The quarantine period for premises with suspect or confirmed VSV cases is 14 days from the onset of lesions in the last affected animal on the premises.

No other cases of VSV have been identified in the immediate area or elsewhere in the state.

VSV can cause blisters and sores in the mouth and on the tongue, muzzle, teats or hooves of horses, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, llamas and a number of other animals. Lesions usually will heal in 2 or 3 weeks. Because of the contagious nature of VSV and its resemblance to other [vesicular] diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), animal health officials urge livestock owners and caretakers to report these signs to their veterinarian immediately. Most animals recover with supportive care by a veterinarian.

"Known competent vectors for transmission of VSV include black flies, sand flies, and biting midges," said Dr. Andy Schwartz, TAHC Executive Director. "Livestock owners should implement best practices to limit livestock exposure to insects."

Some states and other countries may restrict movement of, or impose additional requirements for susceptible animals from states having known cases of VSV. Before moving livestock, contact the state of destination for their requirements. For export information contact the USDA Veterinary Services (VS) Austin office at (301) 851-3300 option 2. "If you suspect your animal has VSV, notify your private veterinarian immediately," said Dr. Schwartz. "VSV is not highly contagious to people but it can cause flu-like illness if infected saliva gets into an open wound, eyes or mouth. People handling potentially infected animals should wear gloves for protection, and talk with a physician if they have questions."

["Vesicular Stomatitis (VS) is a contagious disease that afflicts horses, livestock, wildlife and even humans. The disease is caused by a virus, which although rarely life threatening, can have significant financial impact on the horse industry. VS is a reportable disease; in a suspect case, state and federal animal health authorities will be contacted by your veterinarian. When a case of VS is confirmed, your state veterinarian's office will quarantine the affected farm or ranch. In an effort to minimize risk of spread of the disease, horses and other susceptible species will be confined to that location for at least 14 days from the onset of the last case on that property. Equestrian event organizers may also choose to cancel horse shows, rodeos, and other equestrian activities in the surrounding area. Interstate and international movement of horses may also be restricted.

"When vesicular stomatitis occurs in horses, blister-like lesions usually develop on the tongue, mouth lining, nose or lips. In some cases, lesions can develop on the coronary bands, or on the udder or sheath. When VS is suspected, an exact diagnosis should be obtained by testing the blood for virus-specific antibodies or by testing swabs from the lesions to identify the presence of the virus. Testing is necessary to rule out the possibility that the lesions are caused by photosensitivity (sunburn), irritating feeds or weeds, or toxicity from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications like phenylbutazone.

"VS should not be confused with foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), which does not affect horses, and was eradicated from the U.S.A. in 1929. The incubation period for vesicular stomatitis - meaning the time from exposure until the first signs appear - ranges from 2 to 8 days. A fever may develop initially as blisters form on the tongue, gums, or coronary bands. One of the most obvious clinical signs is drooling or frothing at the mouth and potentially a reluctance to eat. This occurs following rupture of the blisters that create painful ulcers in the mouth. The surface of the tongue may slough. Excessive salivation is often mistaken as a result of a dental problem just as a horse that is not eating well may be suspected as having colic. Weight loss may be a secondary effect, as a horse with mouth ulcers finds it too painful to eat. If lesions form around the coronary band, inflammation within the foot may result in lameness or laminitis. In severe (but rare) cases, the lesions on the coronary band may cause the hoof to slough.

"The disease generally runs its course within 2 weeks, although it may take as long as 2 months for the sores to entirely heal. Live virus can often be isolated from the lesions for up to a week after the lesions appear. During this time, the horse remains infective and the potential remains for the disease to spread to other animals.

"While a horse is suffering from vesicular stomatitis, feeding soft feeds may reduce mouth discomfort. Anti-inflammatory medications may be used as supportive care help to minimize swelling and pain so a horse will continue to eat and drink. If the horse becomes dehydrated from not drinking enough water, your veterinarian may need to provide additional supportive care using intravenous fluids. Secondary bacterial infection of ulcerated areas is another concern. If fever, swelling, inflammation or pus develops around the sores, treatment with antibiotics may be required. Flushing the mouth regularly with a dilute antiseptic solution, such as chlorhexidine in water, may reduce secondary bacterial contamination of the sores and speed healing. However, there is little more an owner or veterinarian can do but wait for healing to occur and take appropriate precautions to minimize the risk of spread of the disease to other horses and livestock.

"There are still some questions regarding how vesicular stomatitis is transmitted and why it only occurs sporadically in the U.S. The disease is distributed only in North, Central, and South America, with a greater incidence in warmer regions. Due to the seasonal occurrence of VS during summer through early fall, it is believed that insects such as biting flies and midges contribute to maintaining the lifecycle of the virus. Black flies, sand flies, and midges are known to transmit the virus, but there may be other insect vectors that have not yet been identified. VS also can be passed from horse to horse by contact with saliva or fluid from ruptured blisters. Physical contact between animals, or contact with buckets, equipment, housing, trailers, feed, bedding, shared water troughs or other items used by an infected horse can provide a ready means of spread. [VS in the USA has been reported 2012-2015. - Mod.TG]

"Humans can contract VS from infected horses. Therefore, it is important to follow proper biosafety measures when handling infected horses to protect yourself from contracting the virus. Precautions should include wearing latex gloves and avoiding direct contact with the horse's saliva or blister fluids. Special care should be taken to keep mouth, eyes and any open wounds from being exposed to infection. Horses may sneeze or snort infective secretions, so you should stand to the side to avoid being sprayed in the face.

"VS in humans tends to cause severe flu-like symptoms such as headache, fever, muscle aches, and extreme fatigue. People rarely develop blisters in their mouths. However, if you experience influenza-like symptoms after working with a VS-infected horse, contact your physician immediately.

"Vaccines have been developed experimentally to help combat vesicular stomatitis, but none are currently approved for use in horses. There is considerable debate over the efficacy of vaccination in preventing or reducing the severity of an outbreak. The period of protection is thought to be fairly limited and once vaccinated, animals will test positive for long periods of time thereby incurring travel restrictions.

"Sunlight and heat are known to quickly destroy the virus causing vesicular stomatitis. Commercial disinfectants such as chlorine bleach (0.645%), Wescodyne (4 %), Roccal (1:200), Septisol (1:50), and cresylic acids (1 %) are also effective."
