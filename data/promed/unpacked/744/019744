A virus associated with infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) has been detected in salmon in an open-net fish farm in Reydarfjordur, East Iceland, reports the Iceland Review. Though the virus has been detected, its associated disease, infectious pancreatic necrosis, has not yet appeared in the salmon, according to the news site. The virus was detected at Icelandic salmon farm Laxar, according to the Food and Veterinary Authority.

In a press release, the Iceland Food and Veterinary Authority said the salmon are in good condition in the net pen where the virus was initially detected. To prevent the spread of the virus, the company has banned the transfer of salmon from that particular net, according to the news site.

[Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is a double-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Birnaviridae, genus _Aquabirnavirus_.

IPNV is a severe threat, ecologically and economically, to the aquaculture industry. The virus causes acute infection with substantial mortality in Atlantic salmon fry and post-smolts. IPN is distributed worldwide, and has been a problem in Norwegian fish farms since 1985 and is regarded as one of the most costly diseases to the aquaculture industry. As the name implies, the pancreatic tissue in the pyloric caeca is a target for the virus and is affected during an acute IPN infection. - Mod.PMB
