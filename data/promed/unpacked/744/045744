Products from a food producer in western Sweden have been recalled after they were linked to a deadly outbreak of [listeriosis].

There have been 4 deaths in Västra Götaland in western Sweden that experts have linked to the _Listeria_ bacteria. Experts at the Centre for Communicable Disease Control (Smittskydd) stressed that all those who passed away were elderly people or affected by other illnesses. In other words, they said it was impossible to confirm that listeriosis, the disease caused by _Listeria_ bacteria, was responsible for the deaths.

But the group behind the meals and the local region are not taking any chances, issuing a recall for potentially contaminated products across the region. The group behind the products, Food Company, released a statement with information about the items that were affected and their expiration dates.

See the full list [in Swedish and machine translated below] at: http://www.foodcompany.se. The items have an expiration date between 16-25 May 2018.

All items -- single portion, pre-cooked and chilled packet meals -- contained mashed potatoes, with the company explaining that the machine that made the mash was responsible for the bacterial outbreak.

It added that the machine has since been removed from the production factory. "This machine has been discarded and is no longer at our factory. We take the event seriously and will implement a number of measures to prevent this from happening again," the company said in a statement.

[The following is a machine-translated list of _Listeria_-contaminated products from the Food Company. The original, in Swedish, is available at http://www.foodcompany.se:

"Fish Symphony with dill sauce and shrimp, served with mashed potatoes;
Cod with dill sauce and shrimp, served with mashed potatoes;
Almond baked fish with dill sauce, lemon, peas and mashed potatoes;
Calffish [?] steak with onion peas, cream sauce, mashed potatoes and lingon;

"The recall applies to products with the following best-served dates:
2018-05-16
2018-05-17
2018-05-18
2018-05-19
2018-05-22
2018-05-23
2018-05-24
2018-05-25

"All of the above products should have been removed from store shelves already last week when we went out to our customers with the recall.

"We encourage customers who bought any of these products with best served before dates mentioned above to bring the products in to the store in which they were bought and get their money back.

"Food Company in Lidköping regrets it deeply.

"For more information about _Listeria_, please visit the Swedish Food Administration website:

The above news report says that 4 deaths have been linked to _Listeria_- contaminated single portion, pre-cooked and chilled packet meals that contained mashed potatoes. The manufacturer says that a machine that made the mashed potatoes was responsible for the contamination, but we are not told how the linkage was established. Did genotypes of clinical _Listeria_ isolates match genotypes of _Listeria_ isolates from the contaminated products? Also, were there any cases of listeriosis linked to the contaminated products who survived their illnesses?

What were the instructions for preparation of the _Listeria_-contaminated products before eating? Were the contaminated products ready-to-eat without further preparation or were they to be reheated or cooked before serving? Cooking or reheating in a microwave oven can leave areas that are inadequately cooked if contamination with an enteric pathogen such as _Listeria_ is present. The US CDC suggests microwaving to internal temperatures of about 165 F [74 C]; also, stirring food in the middle of heating and letting microwaved food sit for a few minutes after cooking to help distribute the heat from hotter areas of food, because microwaving is an uneven process (https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/basics/cook/index.htm). More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.
