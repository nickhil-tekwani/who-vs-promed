According to information given to IA Regnum by the main
administrative board of the Russian Ministry of Extreme Situations in
the Tver region, 216 people have been poisoned with pseudo-alcohol in
the Tver region. The total number of hospitalized patients diagnosed
with "toxic hepatitis" is 216, including 150 men and 66 women; 11
people have died; 2 of them in the Bezhetskiy and Sandovskiy districts.
A mass poisoning from spirit-containing liquids in Rzhev was detected
at the end of August [2006]. The 1st cases of poisoning appeared in
the Tver region on 21 Aug 2006. The reason for the poisoning is the
ingestion of "spirits" of unknown origin, which they purchased from
friends or neighbours. Actually, it was the disinfectant
"Extrasept-1", which contained 93 percent "technical spirit" [see
comment below].
The situation in Rzhev is under the continued supervision of the area
governor, Dmitry Zelenin, law enforcement, and all interested departments.
Necessary medical aid is being provided. The complex of
control-preventive actions is being carried out by employees of the
law enforcement department. 2406 checks of the enterprises of
wholesale and retail trade and the persons engaged in illegal sale of
spirit-containing products have already been carried out by the militia.

[Technical spirit in Russia is crude ethanol spirit, containing
various chemical impurities. It may also be methanol, but methanol is
marked on the bottle "Methanol-poisoning". Also the report doesn't
say anything about deterioration of vision or blindness, as would be
the case with methanol poisoning. - Mod.NP]
[Apparently, this sort of thing, sadly, has happened before, as there
is a case presentation from Estonia in "Alcohol and Alcoholism
Advance Access" originally published online on 10 May 2006. Alcohol
and Alcoholism 2006 41(4):446-450; doi:10.1093/alcalc/agl038. The

"The Composition of Surrogate and Illegal Alcohol Products in Estonia
-------------
Katrin Lang, Marika Vali, Sandor Szucs, Roza Adany and Martin McKee
Abstract - Aim: To identify the composition of illegal and surrogate
alcohol products consumed in Estonia.
Methods: The initial source of information was a series of visits
made in August 2005 to a soup kitchen in central Tartu, Estonia.
Individuals were asked for brief details of their personal
circumstances, what they normally drank, and in addition they were
asked to bring samples of the substances they usually consumed. In
other cases, the substances identified were purchased by the
investigators or from informal contacts in northeastern part of
Estonia, an area that is well known for illegal alcohol consumption.
Samples were tested for chemical contents.
Results: We identified a range of alcohol-containing substances that
are consumed, although, not intended for consumption. These comprised
medicinal products, after-shaves, illegally produced spirits, and
fire-lighting fuel. The medicinal compounds contained, on average, 67
percent ethanol by volume; the after-shaves contained slightly less.
Both were typically pure, with a few containing detectable quantities
of isoamyl alcohol. The illegally produced alcohol contained, on
average, 43 percent ethanol by volume, ranging from 32 to 53 percent.
However, many also contained detectable quantities of long chain
alcohols. These substances are half the price or less of commercial
vodka, with fire lighting fuels especially inexpensive. Conclusions:
There is in Estonia a range of alcohol-containing substances easily
available at low cost. Some contain substantially higher
concentrations of ethanol than commercial spirits and others also
contain toxic long chain alcohols."
