Doom for potato farmers
-----------------------
An unknown disease, besides causing premature wilting of leaves, also
infects tubers. Farmers in the major potato growing areas of Mongar
witnessed their potato plants, their biggest cash crop besides maize,
die an early death.

Farmers said in the last few years, an unknown disease, which added
to premature wilting, also strangely infected the tubers. They had
stored their potatoes in huts, which led to the spread of the
infection.

"It had started from a village and soon spread," a local official
said. "Potatoes turned black and shrunk in size once infected." In an
effort to fight the disease, every household had contributed money to
buy seeds and pesticides. "But it's not working," he said.

While agriculture officials were not available for comment, farmers
said such diseases were usually aggravated by drought.

[Late blight (PLB; caused by the fungus-like pathogen _Phytophthora
infestans_) is rife in the area and affects both leaves and tubers, as
described in this report. PLB can cause 100 percent crop loss. Other
fungi and bacteria often invade blight-infected tubers resulting in
total tuber breakdown, but an association with drought, as claimed
above, is not known.

A number of other potato diseases have also been reported from the
region, including early blight and some viruses. Either of the
pathogens or a combination may be the cause of the problems reported
from Bhutan.
