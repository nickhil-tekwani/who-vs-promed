Increased risk of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the Southern African region
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonotic disease that is transmitted by mosquitoes and can cause severe symptoms in animals and humans. The disease can result in death and abortion in RVF-infected livestock. An epizootic disease in animals, with spillover to the human population, tends to develop extremely rapidly following abnormally high seasonal rainfall at the local, national or regional scale.

FAO maintains a RVF Early Warning Decision Support Tool (RVF DST) based on precipitation and vegetation anomalies, among other environmental factors. According to the RVF DST, southern Africa has experienced above-average rains during the past year and heavy rains and flooding in the recent weeks that may result in suitable environmental conditions for the emergence of RVF.

On 16 Feb 2022, the FAO Animal Health Service, based on the analysis of data available through the FAO web-based RVF DST, Global Early Warning System (GLEWS+), Global Animal Disease Information System (EMPRES-i) and expert knowledge, concluded that there is an increased risk of RVF in [the Southern African] region both in animals and humans for the period February-April 2022, either due to favourable environmental conditions and/or through animal movement and highlighted the urgent need to ensure adequate preparedness for potential disease outbreaks, through One Health coordination.

Based on the risk maps prepared by FAO for the period February-April 2022, large potential hotspots of RVF vector amplification are predicted in South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, southern Zimbabwe, southern Mozambique, north-eastern Namibia, south-eastern and western Angola. Localized hotspots are also forecasted in Madagascar, Malawi and Zambia [map; see in comment].

Considering the recent tropical storms and the above-average precipitation forecasted in the region for April 2022, FAO advises the countries to increase awareness of stakeholders, improve preparedness at national, subnational and community levels to safeguard livestock, livelihoods and public health, especially for exposed and vulnerable communities (farmers, pastoralists), and improve coordination with public health and environment services for managing the risk of RVF outbreaks. In order to prevent and mitigate any occurrence of RVF in the region,

FAO ADVISES COUNTRIES AT RISK THAT:
- A RVF contingency plan with standard operating procedures for outbreak control exists.
- Staff are equipped and trained to implement the plan in case of outbreak.
- Proper safety/protection measures are in place for first responders/staff.
- Staff at all levels (national and/or subnational) are aware of specific high-risk areas.
- Risk based/targeted surveillance is conducted in the high-risk areas.
- Additional actions should be taken to increase the awareness of stakeholders in at-risk areas.

A RVF alert message ("FAO and IGAD alert countries in Eatern Africa to remain vigilant for RVF"), based upon risk maps covering Eastern Africa, has been presented in ProMED post 20220224.8701623.

Preventive RVF vaccination of domestic ruminants has been applied in Southern Africa for many decades, using 2 commercial vaccines -- a live-attenuated, and an inactivated. The last major RVF event took place there in 2010-2011. RVF vaccination statistics are not available (see ProMED post 20110201.0377).

The following (edited) abstract from ref 1 is of note:
"RVF, a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis, is showing complex epidemiological patterns that are poorly understood in South Africa. Large outbreaks occur in the central interior at long, irregular intervals, most recently in 2010-2011; however, the level of herd immunity of ruminant livestock, a key determinant of outbreaks, is unknown. During 2015-2016 a cross-sectional study on 234 randomly-selected farms investigated the prevalence, patterns of, and factors associated with, antibodies to RVF virus (RVFV) in livestock in an area heavily affected by that outbreak. A RVFV inhibition ELISA was used to screen 977 cattle, 1549 sheep and 523 goats and information on potential risk factors was collected using a comprehensive questionnaire. The estimated RVFV seroprevalence, adjusted for survey design, was 42.9% in cattle, 28.0% in sheep and 9.3% in goats, showing a high degree of farm-level clustering. Seroprevalence increased with age and was higher on private vs. communal land, on farms with seasonal pans (temporary, shallow wetlands) and perennial rivers and in recently vaccinated animals. Seropositivity amongst unvaccinated animals born after the last outbreak indicates likely viral circulation during the post-epidemic period. The current level of herd immunity in livestock may be insufficient to prevent another large outbreak, should suitable conditions recur".

An updated advice/guidance on RVF vaccination policy, for livestock holders in Southern and Eastern Africa, would be useful. - Mod.AS
