In my opinion, the leading differential for the deaths of the 6
greyhounds in a track kennel in Keosha, Wisconsin, is infection with
_Streptococcus equi zooepidemicus_. The circumstances and clinical
signs are very similar to that observed in racing greyhounds that
died of _Strep zoo_ infection in a kennel in England in February 2008
(see the March and April 2008 editions of the Veterinary Record ).

In addition to racing greyhounds in the U.S. and U.K., _Strep zoo_
has caused the deaths of kenneled dogs in animal shelters in at least
5 states (Nevada, Florida, Wisconsin, New York, and Pennsylvania) since 2007.

Has lung worm or dirofilaria infestation been discounted?

[Oftentimes in the USA the dirofilaria are referred to as Heartworms,
but the damage is actually in the lungs and some may have learned
this as the lung worm. While some of the signs do fit the infection
of dirofilaria, one wonders if there would be such a high number of
animals affected at essentially the same time. - Mod.TG]
