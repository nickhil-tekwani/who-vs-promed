Epidemic Hits Pigs In Kodagu
---------------------------------
Pandi curry (pork), the number one delicacy of Kodava cuisine, may
become a rarity for want of pigs.
The reason is a yet-to-be diagnosed disease that has claimed several
porcine lives in Kodagu district recently. According to some
veterinarians in the district, pig-rearers have complained of their
stock suffering from fever, often leading to death.
The feverish symptoms, when detected about 4 months ago, were
suspected to be throat-fever by the veterinary doctors. But after
examining specimens of dead pigs at a lab in Bangalore, the
possibility of throat-fever was ruled out, causing further anxiety
not only among the pig-rearers but also the consumers.
So far, nearly 35 pigs have been reported dead because of the strange
disease, and several more are found to be ailing.
Though pork is a delicacy for the Kodagu people, commercial breeding
is almost non-existent in the district. One or more pigs are reared
by farmers or planters for domestic consumption, which again is a
rarity these days because it is more economical and convenient to buy
pork from the market.
Since the pigs are generally reared in concrete stys [stalls] in
Kodagu, they are seldom let out for grazing and are fed well for
fattening. Hence, instances of deaths caused by cardiac arrest are
common among pigs. However, the latest incidents of deaths caused by
the strange fever are a cause of alarm, according to some pig-rearers
in Kodagu.
Veterinarian Dr. M.T. Manjunath said that samples collected from the
deceased porcines have been sent to a lab in North India from where a
report is awaited. "Only the local-breed pigs (naadu handi) are
affected by the disease. But we sell pork brought from other
districts and Andhra Pradesh, which are unaffected so far," said a
few pork dealers in Kodagu.

"Throat fever" is an old term for diphtheria in humans; this
moderator is unaware of a porcine disease with a similar name but is
always eager to learn.
In the animal domain, the term diphtheria (derived from the Greek
diphthera, hide, leather, writing surface) has been used to describe
conditions characterized by the formation of pseudomembrane (fibrin)
covering the tonsils and pharynx. Such conditions are known in
several animal species.
There are several infectious diseases in pigs which are manifested by
fever and respiratory involvement, including some important epizootic
diseases such as classical swine fever, African swine fever,
vesicular exanthema of swine, foot & mouth disease, porcine influenza
and others. Anthrax should be taken into consideration as well, since
it may sometimes be clinically manifested in pigs by progressive
swelling of the throat with dyspnea [shortage of breath] and
difficulty in swallowing.
Some additional information is available in the introduction
"Respiratory Diseases in Pigs" in Merck's Veterinary Manual, available at
<http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/121400.htm&word=Respiratory%2cpigs>.
Results of the clinical and laboratory investigations in Kodagu will
be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
[I am unaware of the term throat fever applied to animals. The only
condition which seems to come close to diphtheria in swine is
streptococcal fibrinous bronco-pneumonia. - Mod.TG]
