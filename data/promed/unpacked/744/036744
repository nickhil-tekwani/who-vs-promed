An outbreak of distemper has been killing seal pups off the coast of
Denmark, authorities said Saturday [23 Jun 2007], warning that
thousands of seals could die if the disease spreads to other northern
European countries.
Since Tuesday [19 Jun 2007], at least 41 harbor seal pups have been
found dead on the small island of Anholt, midway between Denmark and
Sweden, and tests indicate distemper, according to The Danish Forest
and Nature Agency. The government agency normally finds around 30
dead seals a year.
"There is therefore reason to fear that we will see a large number of
dead seals on Danish beaches in coming months," said Henrik Lykke
Soerensen, an agency spokesman.
The agency said it would kill dying seals found on the shores of the
island to try to prevent the spread of the disease, which does not
affect humans.
The disease causes respiratory problems, fever and sometimes
disorientation, while leaving the animal's immune system weakened and
susceptible to other diseases, such as pneumonia.
Lykke Soerensen said it was still unclear which strain of virus
authorities were dealing with, but that the agency was expecting to
identify it in the next few days.
The seal population in Denmark has been hit by the disease twice
before. In 2002, it killed nearly half the harbor seal population
along the coasts of Denmark, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands,
Britain and Ireland. Another outbreak, in 1988, wiped out nearly 60
percent of northern Europe's harbor seal population. The cause of
both outbreaks remains unknown.
The recent dead animals were pups born this year [2007] or in 2006.
Older animals become immune to the virus, which is spread by direct
contact with body fluids or by scratching, clawing or biting.
Anholt is a sanctuary for some of the estimated 12 000 harbor seals,
also known as common seals, that live in the Baltic Sea waterway
between the 2 Scandinavian countries.

[If the laboratory confirms that this is a new outbreak of phocine
distemper virus, preventing its spread seems to be a complex, if not
impossible, undertaking. However, if the current virus is found to be
identical or closely related to the one involved in the 2002
outbreak, the fact that it has emerged less than 5 years after the
previous North Sea epizootic may give cautious hope that some of the
potentially exposed seal population still maintains residual, though
probably limited, partial immunity.
During the last outbreak in 2002, the total mortality exceeded 18 000
seals. - Mod.AS]
