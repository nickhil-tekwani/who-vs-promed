["Equine infectious anaemia (EIA) is a persistent viral infection of equids. The causative agent, EIA virus (EIAV) is a lentivirus in the family _Retroviridae_, subfamily _Orthoretrovirinae_. Other members of the genus _Lentivirus_ include: bovine immunodeficiency virus; caprine arthritis encephalitis virus; feline immunodeficiency virus; human immunodeficiency virus 1; human immunodeficiency virus 2; and maedi/visna virus. EIA can be diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs, pathological lesions, serology, and molecular methods. Infected horses remain viraemic carriers for life and, with very rare exceptions, yield a positive serological test result. Antibody response usually persists and antibody-positive animals, older than 6-8 months, are identified as virus carriers (below 6-8 months of age, serological reactions can be due to maternal antibodies; status can be confirmed by molecular techniques). Infected equids are potential virus reservoirs. Biting flies are mechanical vectors for the virus in nature." (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.06_EIA.pdf)

"Equine infectious anemia has been found nearly worldwide, but it appears to be absent from a few countries, including Iceland and Japan."

"There is no evidence that equine infectious anemia is a threat to humans." (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/equine_infectious_anemia.pdf). - Mod.CRD
