South Africa suspends exports of ostrich meat, live birds
---------------------------------------------------------
South Africa, which accounts for 80 percent of world ostrich
production, suspended exports of ostrich meat and all live birds
following an avian flu outbreak.

The disease outbreak has been narrowed down to one farm with about
5000 ostriches in Oudtshoorn [Western Cape province], Wouter Kriel,
the spokesman for the Western Cape Provincial Department of
Agriculture, said in a phone interview today [14 Apr 2011]. Oudtshoorn
is about 450 km (279 miles) from Cape Town.

Each month South Africa exports 108 million rand (USD 15.9 million)
of ostrich meat, sought after for its low cholesterol and fat content,
said Anton Kruger, a spokesman for the South African Ostrich Business
Chamber. About 90 percent of exports go to Europe and 3 percent to
East Asia. South Africa in 2005 lost 600 million rand [approx USD 88
million] in exports because of an avian flu outbreak, losing 26 000
birds and 4000 jobs.

The ban mainly affects ostrich meat, which accounts for 62 percent of
the industry's 2.1 billion rand [approx USD 305 million] annual
turnover, Kruger said. The export of feathers is under negotiation,
while leather products and egg shells are unaffected, he said.

No slaughtering is taking place, the agriculture department's Kriel
said. Measures to contain the virus may include either vaccination or
culling, he said.

The World Organization of Animal Health [OIE] normally requires that
infected birds be culled, Kruger said. The average price of an ostrich
is 2500 rand [about USD 365], he said.

"It's difficult to say at this stage how long the suspension will be
in place," Kruger said. The Department of Agriculture should be able
to use "backward tracing" to locate the source of the disease and
eradicate it, he said.

Ostriches are tested for avian flu every 28 days, following the
initial outbreak of the disease in South Africa in 2005, Kruger said.
No ostriches can be transported anywhere without a health certificate
saying they have been tested within this period, he said.

About 80 percent of ostrich farms are in the Western Cape and about
15 percent in the Eastern Cape, Kruger said.

[Ostriches kept for meat production are defined as "poultry"
according to OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code. The full
definition, and all other information pertaining to the international
trade in poultry and poultry products in relation to avian influenza
(AI), are included in chapter 10.4 of the Code, available at
http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.10.4.htm.
Export is expected to be conveniently feasible from "HPNAI free
country, zone, or compartment". Hence, zoning and compartmentalisation
are tools which may enable continued exports from countries not
considered 'HPNAI free'.

For the Code's requirements concerning export/import of fresh poultry
meat, please refer to Article 10.4.19.

The current outbreak is caused by HPAI H5N2. Similarly, H5N2 was the
causative strain in the previous AI outbreaks in South Africa, in 2004
and 2006. In this context we have received the following comment from
subscriber Nati Elkin: "Interestingly, there seems to be a pattern of
repeatability, even with long time gaps, in the occurrence of certain
AI strains in domestic birds within given geographical niches. H5N2
(though of low pathogenicity) has similarly reoccurred in Taiwan with
relatively long time gaps. May this be indicative of a continuous
reservoir within the same niche?" A worthy question. - Mod.AS]
