Subject: Banana wilt in Kenya -- but which one are we talking about? [edited]

There are 2 wilts, something the newspaper report does not make
clear. _Fusarium_ wilt has been around for years and I don't think
this is what the politician is talking about. Assuming this to be the
case, here are some outline facts.
Banana _Xanthomonas_ Wilt (BXW) was 1st recorded in Uganda and
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) around the same time, in 2001. The
DRC occurrence did not become known for several years but Uganda was
active in investigating and managing the disease from the 1st
confirmation of its cause (by the Global Plant Clinic, specifically
by Dr. Julian Smith).
Its origins are uncertain, though the same pathogen has been known
from Ethiopia for nearly 40 years. BXW (also referred to as BBW for
banana bacterial wilt) is also present in Rwanda and Tanzania.
Despite initial positive reports there is no confirmation that the
disease has spread to Burundi. New disease records have been
published for Uganda, DRC and now Rwanda and are available online.
Tanzania is in the pipeline. Kenya will follow soon. The new disease
records are available at: <http://www.bspp.org.uk/ndr>.
The Global Plant Clinic (GPC) has confirmed all recent discoveries of
BXW and works closely in collaboration with national scientists,
e.g., NARO in Uganda and more recently KARI in Kenya. A paper has
just been accepted by Plant Pathology which examines the relationship
between the banana _Xanthomonas_ and other species. The GPC website
is at: <http://www.globalplantclinic.org>.
The GPC would be happy to help with any queries about diseases in
Africa, Latin America and Asia.

[Thank you very much for this contribution. Since the original item
on the banana wilt outbreak in Uganda -- 20070317.0939 -- names the
disease as _Fusarium_ wilt and the Kenyan source claims that the
disease was spread from there, it may probably be assumed that the
disease in Kenya is also the _Fusarium_ wilt. However, we would be
very pleased to receive any further evidence that anyone may have on
this issue. The information on the bacterial type of banana wilt
supplied by Mr Boa is most interesting and we are happy to pass it
on. Thank you to A. Dodds for forwarding Mr Boa's comment. - Mod.DHA]
