Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1

African elephant (_Loxodonta africana_ (Elephantidae) / 71227 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
African elephant (_Loxodonta africana_ (Elephantidae) / 0 / 0 / 100 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: an elephant was found dead in the Kazima forest by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks officers during routine patrols. They noted unclotted blood oozing from the mouth, whereupon they collected blood samples for submission to the Botswana National Veterinary Laboratory as they suspected anthrax. The national park often gets flares of outbreaks of anthrax in different wildlife species, but no cases have been recorded in livestock for years now in the adjacent livestock zone as they are regularly vaccinated against anthrax. The carcass was burnt to ashes.

Control measures
Measures applied: no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Botswana National Veterinary Laboratory (national laboratory) / African Elephant inoculation test / 22 May 2014 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[Dealing with elephant carcasses is always a problem, frequently exacerbated by the absence of adequate firewood or liquid fuels. Burning infected carcasses is normally the optimum decision in livestock and game outbreaks. Some have recommended covering elephant carcasses with thorn brush to discourage scavengers. Putrefaction with the normal acidification of the carcass tissues that accompanies it will rapidly kill the vegetative organisms. So the environmental contamination around an unopened carcass may be relatively modest. - Mod.MHJ
