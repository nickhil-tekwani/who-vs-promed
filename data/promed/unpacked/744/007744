On 6 Aug 2012, equine infectious anemia (EIA) was confirmed in a 3-month-old foal in North Rhine Westphalia [NW]. According to the LANUV (State Agency for Nature, Environment and Consumer Protection), at 2 days of age the foal suffered from joint ill [navel-septic arthritis] and, as part of the treatment, received blood plasma from a donor horse. Meanwhile antibodies to EIA were detected in the blood of the donor.

Since 2009, 20 other horses have received plasma from this horse, of which 4 (in NW) have become infected.

To prevent further spread of infection these 4 animals have been euthanized as there is no treatment or vaccine for the disease.
The 4 horses come from holdings in the districts of Viersen, Rhein-Erft, Rhein-Sieg, and Oberberg.

All horses kept with the infected animals are examined for infection; humans are not at risk as the disease only infects equines.

Background
----------
EIA is a viral disease occurring worldwide and affecting equines (horses, donkeys, mules, zebra). The disease is transmitted by blood sucking insects and occurs sporadically in Germany (5 cases in 2011, 6 so far in 2012), usually in horses imported from Eastern Europe, especially Romania.

Horses carrying the virus often don't display any symptoms of disease but seem healthy. These animals can be asymptomatic for years but stress can lead to clinical disease with high fever, pale mucous membranes, bleeding, and swelling of limbs and abdomen.

Restrictions applied in case of a disease outbreak will cause heavy economic losses for the owners of breeding and sport horses.

[EIA is caused by a lentivirus (_Retroviridae_). Though not a zoonosis, its epidemiology resembles HIV in humans and this has enhanced research into the disease. Since the pathogen has not been shown to multiply in insects, infected equids appear to be the only reservoir of the virus. Iatrogenic transmission via hypodermic needles and tattoo equipment is well-known. Infection by the injection of blood plasma, as described above, should not surprise and deserves the attention and precaution of equine practitioners.
