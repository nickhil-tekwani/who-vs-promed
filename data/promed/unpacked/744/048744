[1] United Kingdom: increased incidence, low perception of risk in the population

General practitioners (GPs) are being urged to be vigilant for measles, particularly in people returning from European hotspots such as Italy, France, Greece, Romania and Russia. There have been nearly 600 recorded cases of measles in England alone this year [2018] -- more than throughout 2017 -- and most were caught abroad, but what are the risks? And how can travellers, adults and children protect themselves?

Risk, or rather perception of risk, is an odd thing when it comes to illnesses such as measles (and mumps and rubella/German measles). The public tend to worry too much about rare but dangerous infections and too little about common "childhood" diseases that only occasionally maim or kill. Yet, overall, the milder diseases tend to exact the biggest toll.

Most people, for instance, are more than happy to be vaccinated against tetanus (and often actively ask for it after an injury), but would not think of having the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab before heading off to Russia to watch the World Cup. Yet in a typical year, there are only a handful of tetanus cases in the UK, and the milder, but much commoner, measles virus has killed twice as many people over the past 20 years.

It is not only children who are at risk from measles. Indeed, adults over 30 years of age are those most likely to develop complications. Serious problems are still comparatively rare, but pneumonia can strike in as many as one in 16 cases, about one in 1500 cases will develop encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), and at least one in 5000 will die (there were 35 deaths across Europe last year [2017]).

I have a vested interest. My youngest sister, Caroline, was born profoundly deaf after my mother caught German measles (rubella) during pregnancy, before the MMR jab was introduced. One of the many advantages of protecting people against measles is that you can also protect them against mumps and rubella. So, who should consider the MMR jab?

In theory, the vaccine is available to anyone who has not had both shots (typically given at one year of age and just before start of school). The vaccine was not introduced until the late 1980s, although separate jabs were available from the early 1970s. Your GP records should detail what you have had, and if you did not receive both doses, then you can get the vaccine free from the National Health Service (NHS).

Doctors are most interested in those who have missed out after the MMR scare in the 1990s when the vaccine was linked -- wrongly -- to autism. In particular, young women in their late teens or early twenties who will soon be considering starting a family [are at risk of not having received the vaccine]. If this sounds like you, then please talk to your GP or practice nurse about having the MMR jab before trying to conceive (you cannot have the jab while pregnant). My sister was one of the lucky ones. Rubella in pregnancy can do far more than destroy a child's hearing.

This same cohort of young adults is also most at risk while visiting Europe over the summer because they are more likely to attend crowded events such as music festivals and football matches or nightclubs, where the highly contagious virus spreads easily. However, travellers of any age should check the latest guidance for their destination on websites such as NHS Scotland's fitfortravel.nhs.uk, and if they have not had both MMR jabs to consider vaccination where advised -- even if they think they may have had measles, mumps or rubella as a child.

What about side effects? A sore arm and occasionally a mild measles- or mumps-type illness, and/or aching joints (particularly adults) are the commonest complaints, so have the jab at least one month before your trip. As many as one in 1000 children will have a febrile convulsion, and one in 24 000 develop a problem with blood clotting (due to fewer platelets), which can lead to bruising and bleeding.

[2] France: death of a transplant recipient and athlete, questioning of antivaccine groups
Date: Thu 19 Jul 2018

https://cnnchile.com/mundo/crece-el-debate-mundial-contra-los-antivacunas-tras-la-muerte-de-destacada-atleta-francesa_20180711/
English: https://tech2.org/chile/the-global-debate-against-anti-vaccines-grows-after-the-death-of-a-prominent-french-athlete/


The French athlete Marine Eraville died at age 16 years on Tuesday [17 Jul 2018] after a measles outbreak. The athlete faced her first health battle at 2 years of age when she received a heart transplant, which did not prevent her from later representing France in the Olympic Games for transplant [recipients]. Eraville won medals in swimming in South Africa, Argentina and Spain, Biobiochile reported.

After the death of Marine Eraville from measles, the world debate grows against antivaccine groups, whose actions contribute to the low rate of vaccination and have led to this disease advancing when it was already believed to be controlled. According to our partner associates, in south west France where this outbreak of measles occurred, there are 2 situations that keep citizens at constant risk: that of several who refuse to trust the effects of vaccination plus the crisis that some French cities experience when the coverage is not as broad as is commonly believed.

Marine's case was complicated by the fact that she was born in a home where she did not receive vaccines because of her medical condition; however, the complaint grows against those who do have the health to inoculate and who, by ideals, decide not to do so and sometimes even encourage others not to vaccinate.

The World Health Organization (WHO) warned in February [2018] that cases in the European Union increased 400 per cent in 2017.

The current debate was sparked on social networks, especially by specialized medical sites, which criticize antivaccination groups.

[3] Ireland alert
Date: Fri 20 Jul 2018
Source: Independent [edited]
https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/health/public-alert-as-two-cases-of-measles-diagnosed-in-dublin-37138288.html


The public has been warned to be vigilant for the signs of measles after 2 cases of the disease were confirmed in Dublin. The Health Service Executive (HSE) [Ireland's public health service] said today [20 Jul 2018] that measles was diagnosed in an adult and a child who returned to Dublin after being on mainland Europe. Measles has led to 31 deaths across Europe this year [2018].

Dr Helena Murray, specialist in public health medicine said, "Measles can be a serious illness and is highly infectious. The best protection is to be fully vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine."

There is a possible risk of measles to people who may have been in the same healthcare setting as these 2 cases during the infectious period. People at increased risk are those who are not fully vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine or have not had measles in the past. The risk of measles is for up to 21 days after contact with a case of measles.

"If you think you may have measles, stay at home and phone your GP for advice," she said. "Currently the HSE is aware that the 2 measles cases attended the healthcare settings [listed in the URL above] while they were most infectious." The HSE said its public health department has sent an alert to all emergency departments and GPs in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow to inform them to be vigilant about measles.

There are ongoing outbreaks of measles in multiple countries in the European region and worldwide. Most of the cases in the EU in 2018 were reported from Romania, France, Greece, and Italy. Most people who get measles on holiday do not know they were exposed until they develop disease. Unrecognised exposures to measles have occurred at airports, on planes, at concerts, in shops and healthcare settings.

The outbreak of the measles virus continues across EU/EEA countries, according to the latest Communicable Diseases Threats Report (CDTR). In a report on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's (ECDC) website, it says the most recent collected data through epidemic intelligence revealed the following countries have reported the highest number of measles virus cases in 2018: Romania, 4317; France, 2588; Greece, 2238; and Italy, 1716. Since the start of the year [2018], there have been 31 reported deaths across the region due to measles.

To stop transmission of measles and to protect those most vulnerable to severe complications and death, especially infants, it has been advised that at least 95 per cent of the population needs to be vaccinated with 2 doses of a vaccine comprising measles. There are only 4 EU/EEA countries that have managed to reach the 95 per cent target for both the 1st and 2nd doses, which has shown officials that more action is needed to combat this growing issue.

All 6 member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) [sic. See WHO's list of member states http://www.who.int/choice/demography/by_country/en/; and Wikipedia's entry for WHO says 194. - Mod.SH] have the objective to eliminate measles globally by 2020. The ECDC concluded in its report: "The continued circulation of measles in the region stresses the importance for people to be vaccinated with 2 doses, to protect themselves and their families."

As of 20 Jun 2018, 463 cases (200 in Roraima and 263 in the Amazon) were confirmed and 1545 investigated, the Ministry [of Health] said in a bulletin. According to laboratory investigations, the strain of the virus found in Brazil is the same strain in circulation in Venezuela, a country suffering from a strong health crisis.

Rio de Janeiro registered its 1st 2 cases of measles in 18 years, reported the Ministry of Health in Brazil after the virus was found in other regions in the country. The health body said in a statement that the patients are students at the Faculty of Law of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Last week, the Ministry of Health confirmed an outbreak of measles in the states of Amazon and Roraima, in the northern part of the country, where the virus had been eradicated since 2016.

The 2 deaths from measles this year [2018] were in Roraima, a state bordering Venezuela and the main recipient of the growing flow of immigrants into the country. In addition, 2 Venezuelans died in early 2018 from the disease.

According to laboratory studies, the strain of the virus found in Brazil is the same found in Venezuela, a country suffering from a crisis with shortages of food, basic products and medications. On the other hand, according to data from the Ministry of Health as of 11 Jun 2018, 2 cases of measles among Brazilian Yanomami people in the same border area and 24 additional cases in Venezuelan domestic people were confirmed. There are still 61 cases under investigation.

The human rights organization Survival International issues a warning: "These communities are the most vulnerable. Urgent medical help is the only thing between them and devastation," says director Stephen Corry. Measles is a contagious disease, caused by an airborne virus. Red spots on the skin, fever, cough and conjunctivitis are the common symptoms.

Vaccination in Brazil is permanent and nonstationary, but the government has intensified its activities due to the recent low immunization rate and the return of disease.

[In 2016, after a massive, decades-long vaccination campaign, WHO declared Latin America free of measles. But less than 2 years later, a virulent outbreak in Venezuela, combined with a mass exodus from the country, is threatening that medical success story. Brazil and Colombia have reported cases of measles, all imported from Venezuela. Peru now also has reported a case -- see next post. This is clear evidence why vaccination must be maintained even in countries that are declared "measles-free", and it is further evidence of the global world in which we live where borders are political designations and do not prevent spread of pathogens. - Mod.LK]

According to health officials, at least one imported case of measles was confirmed in Lima [Peru] as of early July [2018]. Local sources report that the patient, a one year old child, contracted the disease in Venezuela. Health officials have issued an epidemiological alert and implemented public health measures, including vaccination campaigns, to limit further spread of the disease.

Potentially affected individuals are advised to ensure their measles vaccination is up to date (including booster shots) and to contact their doctor with any questions or concerns. Anyone experiencing symptoms [high fever, runny nose, cough, red and watery eyes, small white spots inside the cheeks, and rash spreading from the face and neck to the hands and feet over several days] is urged to seek immediate medical attention.

In a follow-up to recent measles cases in Multnomah County, Oregon, health officials have confirmed that a 3rd person with measles symptoms has tested positive for the virus. The 3rd individual in Multnomah County tested positive for measles 13 Jul 2018. This person was unvaccinated and had been in close contact with a 2nd individual diagnosed with measles on 6 Jul 2018.

Multnomah County Communicable Disease Services had alerted this 3rd individual of the exposure and asked the person to stay at home and away from others. The 3rd individual was in daily contact with Multnomah County's team to check for symptoms.

"Once again our measles response plan worked, thanks to another individual willing to stay away from others and call us at the first sign of symptoms," said Multnomah County deputy health officer, Dr Jennifer Vines.

The 1st case in Multnomah County was confirmed in the Portland metro area -- the 1st since 2014. The 1st individual did have vaccine records. A person who spent time with the 1st individual during the infectious period did not have documentation of prior immunizations. That person tested positive for measles 6 Jul 2018 and has remained home. However, that 2nd individual had been in daily contact with a 3rd individual who also did not have records of prior immunization. That person tested positive for measles Fri 13 Jul 2018.
