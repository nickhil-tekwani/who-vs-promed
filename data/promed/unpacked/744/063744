The Andalusian Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development, Elena Viboras, said yesterday [10 Oct 2014] that the bluetongue disease outbreaks that have been detected in the community [Andalusia] and resulted in imposed restrictions on the movement of sheep in the provinces of Cadiz, Cordoba, Malaga, Huelva and Sevilla, have affected at least 25 farms "and possibly some more," -- but the outbreak is "controlled."

The Minister urged the population to be "calm" because, she as she recalled, it is "an infectious disease caused by a mosquito" but "it does not involve risk of transmission to humans, affecting only animals," and also because "the serotype has been found to be 4, which is less aggressive."

The minister reported that the 1st outbreak was reported in the municipality of Fuente Palmera, Cordoba province, and was followed by outbreaks in about 25 other farms, not only in the province of Cordoba. Along these lines, she explained that the only Andalusian provinces currently not under sheep movement restrictions are Granada, Almeria, and Jaen, although she said that animals can indeed move "perfectly well" within each of the other 5 affected provinces. Viboras said that the regional government has held "meetings with agricultural organizations and farmers", who thus have "actual knowledge" of the situation, and "know exactly what to do." She explained that "there are currently no vaccines" but that with temperatures dropping, the disease will phase down. In areas which were vaccinated last year [2013], "the animals this year [2014] will not be affected". Meanwhile, Asaja [young farmers association] and COAG [Coordinator of Growers and Livestock Farmers Organisations] hope that the government will cover the costs of bluetongue vaccines, although both organisations underline the need for the EU to "get involved financially" and provide funding for these vaccines.

[2] Morocco (northwest): ovine

Bluetongue disease (BT) is sweeping throughout northwest Morocco and the veterinarian, powerless, can only witness the associated losses and try to comfort sheep owners.

Nearly a month ago, BT started spreading in the Loukkos zone, an irrigated plain where livestock industry consists mainly of dairy cattle farming while small ruminant rearing is only a minor business. Some small villages do, nevertheless, have grazing areas where people raise sheep flocks. In some of them, BT has re-emerged after being absent for the last 12 months or so. Indeed, at the end of summer 2013, a limited number of BT outbreaks were reported in the Loukkos region and another one in the Gharb region.

Laboratory examinations confirmed the presence of bluetongue virus (BTV). The present outbreak showed a high morbidity rate, around 60 percent, and a case fatality rate of about 10 percent. Clinical signs are dominated by nasal discharge and a marked inflammation of the lips and tongue. The disease is highly contagious but early treatment with antibiotics, vitamins, together with liquid feed orally contribute to minimize the clinical effects of the disease. Suspected cases are notified to government veterinary services and a veterinary inspector promptly visits the affected flocks and takes samples to be sent to the diagnostic laboratory. However, vaccination seems to be effected only upon sheep owners' request.

The BT epizootic in Morocco, published in ProMED-MENA list covering the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries, has not yet been serotyped. Subscribers are encouraged to read the relevant commentary by Mod.AB in PRO/MENA posting 20141001.2818837.

It may be assumed that the Moroccan epizootic is caused by a serotype similar to the one said to be recently identified in Andalusia, namely BTV-4; serotyping results from Morocco have not yet become available. Official OIE notifications on BT outbreaks from both countries, including detailed laboratory results, are anticipated.

BTV-4 has been spreading in south east Europe since early June 2014, starting at the very southern tip of Greece (Peloponnese), spreading northwards to invade the rest of Greece, Bulgaria, the European part of Turkey (Kirklareli), Macedonia, Romania, Albania, Serbia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. This year's (2014) BT epizootic has become one of the largest recorded in Europe, apparently controlled (by vaccination) only in Turkey's Kirklareli; vaccination has not been applied elsewhere. According to recent reports from Greece, Romania, and Macedonia, the virus continues its circulation. Their respective recent OIE follow-up reports are available as follows:
Greece, follow-up report No 8, 6 Oct 2014: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=16203
Former Yug. Rep. of Macedonia, follow-up report No 6, 10 Oct 2014:
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=16205
Romania, follow-up report No 21, 10 Oct 2014:
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=16274.

What was the route of the virus introduction, through Greece? Samples from Greece and Bulgaria have been genotyped by the reference laboratory at Pirbright and found to be of the western clade, probably originating in Africa (see ProMED-mail 20140905.2752260). Media reports on BTV in Algeria were published in August (see ProMED-mail 20140905.2752260). The disease has been suspected in Algeria in August (see item 4 in ProMED-mail 20140830.2733767). It will be interesting to check if the Moroccan strain is similar to the virus circulating in southeast Europe.
