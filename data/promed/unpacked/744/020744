Ministry of Health spokesman Abdel Rahman Shahin announced the
discovery of the latest case of bird flu [avian influenza A/(H5N1)
virus infection], afflicting a 25-year-old woman in Beheira
governorate. The unnamed woman constitutes the 114th case of bird flu
since the onset of the disease in Egypt.

Shaheen noted that the woman entered a local hospital with a high
fever and flu symptoms after being exposed to household birds
suspected of carrying the disease.

The spokesperson further added that "medical examinations found her
suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis." She is currently stable after
being administered a dose of the drug Tamiflu.

[A suspected 114th case was reported in ProMED-mail post: "Avian
influenza, human (63): Egypt (DQ) susp. 114th case 20101208.4378."
This case was a 30-year-old man, a resident of Dakahlia governorate,
who died on 6 Dec 2010. There has been no subsequent confirmation of
this case, and, therefore, the 25-year-old woman in Beheira
governorate becomes the confirmed 114th case.
