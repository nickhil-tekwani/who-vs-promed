The County of San Diego has announced the ongoing outbreak of shigellosis now stands at 46 confirmed and 5 probable cases, with slowing cases from a week ago and a total of 3 since the 41 confirmed and 7 probable cases reported in the 3 Dec 2021 update.

The continuing investigation shows onset of illness dates between 16 Aug 2021 and 21 Nov 2021, with the new cases occurring between 15-21 Nov 2021, with symptom onset for the latest case being 27 Nov 2021. The 51 cases in this outbreak represent 13% of the 402 total cases reported to date in San Diego County.

The County Public Health shigella website includes an epidemiological curve showing declining case numbers in recent weeks. The cases are among individuals experiencing homelessness, with the majority at multiple locations in central San Diego and 2 cases in North County.

No source of the outbreak has currently been identified. The County continues to work closely with the City of San Diego, regional homeless service providers, and others to identify new cases, prevent future potential exposures and promote good hygienic and sanitation precautions.

Shigellosis is a contagious infection typically spread by contaminated surfaces, food or water, or person to person. Those at increased risk include young children (especially those in daycare), people who are experiencing homelessness, travelers to locations with poor sanitation, and men who have sex with men. In 2020, a total of 240 shigellosis cases were reported in San Diego County residents while the 426 cases reported in 2019 were the highest since 1995.

Strategies to avoid getting or spreading _Shigella_ include frequent hand washing and not preparing food while ill with diarrhea.

[This cluster parallels the beginning of the hepatitis A epidemic occurring in many states in the USA which began in the homeless in San Diego county (Hepatitis A - USA (46): (CA) fatal 20171017.5386460).

Shigella was discovered more than 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. Shigella organisms can survive transit through the stomach because they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices commoner in men who have sex with men. Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

The bacterium is the classical cause of bacterial dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux), an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing diarrhea). - Mod.LL
