Re. Avian influenza (32): Japan, raccoons, serology
---------------------------------------------------
The report on finding positive serological reactions in sera of 10 out
of 988 wild raccoons in Japan requires further information before we
can conclude that raccoons are a threat for the introduction of H5N1
avian influenza virus into chicken farms that would warrant the
imposition of countermeasures.

Firstly, which serological test(s) were used, and did they reveal
reactions to both the H5 and the N1 components of the virus?

Is there any information on the reliability of the test used,
presumably standardized for testing avian sera, when used with serum
from raccoons?

Is there any estimate of sensitivity or specificity? This question is
particularly pertinent, because if the 10 reactions found are
considered to be false positive reactions, then this would still give
the test about 99 percent specificity, a figure that is acceptable
for many serological tests so long as the results are interpreted
with care.

In this report, it appears that not all reacting sera were from
raccoons in areas where H5N1 infection in birds was known to have
occurred. Further, it appears that there is no clustering of
reactors. Both these points raise the concern that the reactions are
false positives, but further testing, such as with western blots,
could clarify this.

If the reactions in the test(s) are true indications of specific
antibody, was this antibody produced in response to infection of the
raccoons or simply due to their exposure to viral antigen in
scavenged, infected birds? Was there been any attempt to demonstrate the
presence of infectious virus in any of the tested raccoons?

Whereas the presence of antibody in an animal is often equated with
evidence of prior infection, it may also be due to exposure to
antigen without actual infection or, as suggested in the article, due
to maternal transfer. It has been shown that raccoons in the USA can
be infected with avian influenza viruses and that those in the wild
have antibodies to a range of different hemagglutinin types (Hall et
al 2008). However, animals have been shown to develop antibodies to
other viruses present in high titre in scavenged prey, even though
the scavenging animal may not become infected. For example,
antibodies to the rabbit calicivirus causing rabbit hemorrhagic
disease have been found in European foxes scavenging rabbits that
have died of this disease and, under experimental conditions, in
foxes fed on infected rabbit liver (Leighton et al 1995), but no
evidence of infection in foxes has been found.

It may well be that raccoons in Japan need to be considered when
designing methods to prevent introduction of H5N1 to chicken farms,
but more information is needed.

[Regarding the identity of the raccoons, queried in a comment in the
previous post, it seems from the last paragraph of that report -- (32)
below -- that they are indeed feral imported American raccoons:
"Raccoons are found throughout the nation. Many of them are descended
from abandoned pets or have run away from zoos." - Mod.JW]
