[Brucellosis morbidity in Armenia is 60-70 times higher than in the European Union. There were 381 brucellosis cases identified nationwide in Armenia in 2014 (http://www.arminfo.info/index.cfm?objectid=977CFEB0-CA3B-11E4-99FD0EB7C0D21663 in Russian). - Mod.NR

Brucellosis (http://www.emedicinehealth.com/brucellosis/page2_em.htm) is a disease that is thought to have existed since ancient times, as it was first described more than 2000 years ago by the Romans and Hippocrates. It was not until 1887 that a British physician, Dr David Bruce, isolated the organism that causes brucellosis from several deceased patients from the island of Malta. This disease has had several names throughout its history, including Mediterranean fever, Malta fever, Crimean fever, Bang's disease, and undulant fever (because of the relapsing nature of the fever associated with the disease).

The signs and symptoms of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may develop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic symptoms.

The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive, and they can be similar to those of many other febrile illnesses, so recognition of potential exposure -- from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, working in a slaughter house or meat processing plant, or working in a microbiology lab -- is vital. - Mod.LL
