Leishmaniasis disease has again surfaced in the Sra Rogha area of tehsil Sarwakai in South Waziristan tribal district, while the authorities have turned a blind eye towards the situation.

Local sources said leishmaniasis [cutaneous] cases are reported in Barond, Mawalay Khan Serai, Chagmalai and Saplatoi areas of Sarwakai tehsil. Sources said about 80 persons have contracted the disease in Mawalay Khan Serai and Saplatoi Barond.

The same areas of South Waziristan were also impacted by leishmaniasis during April and May last year [2019]. A large-scale campaign was run at that time to overcome the situation. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government had provided about 30 000 injections for the area to control the disease. Mosquito killing sprays were also applied, and thousands of mosquito kits were distributed among the local population to protect them from leishmaniasis.

The local people said the disease has again raised its ugly head in the area, as people were not provided mosquito kits and no fumigation was carried out. They said the situation could have been better if these measures were taken in time.

People of the area have demanded the concerned authorities to dispatch the equipment meant for leishmaniasis prevention to Sarwakai, Sra Rogha instead of district headquarters in Wana. They said it will save the residents from travel to get the equipment. They also said that the government must conduct an audit of the equipment provided for disease prevention last year [2019]. They said the Health Department must be made accountable in this regard.

During the last year's [2019] outbreak, as many as 28 000 leishmaniasis cases were reported from the tribal districts. After the outbreak, a public health emergency was declared in the area after they ran out of vaccinations and medications for children suffering from the disease.

According to official data, in Bajaur a total of 2802 cases were reported, out of which 1000 were treated. From Mohmand, 5373 cases were reported, out of which 3000 were treated. From Khyber, 9378 cases were reported, out of which 3000 were treated, while from Kurram, 525 cases were reported, out which 100 were treated. From Orakzai, 163 cases were reported. From North Waziristan, 443 cases were reported, out of which treatment was provided to 300, and from South Waziristan, 334 cases were reported, of which 300 were provided medication.
