The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are cooperating with the Dominican Republic in the management of a histoplasmosis outbreak that has taken the lives of 3 public workers out of a group of 28 who were cleaning the tunnels of a dam in the northwestern part of the country.

The deceased workers were 36, 22, and 34 years old. This occurrence created concern in Sabana Iglesia municipality in Santo Domingo, where these persons used to live.

The US Embassy in Santo Domingo reported that they are cooperating with the management of this sanitary problem at the request of the Ministry of Public Health, after 28 workers from the National Institute for Hydraulic Resources and the National Hydroelectric Company became affected while cleaning the tunnels of Taveras-Bao dam in Santiago.

The workers entered into the tunnels without adequate protection, and their cleaning operations lasted for 41 days before developing the symptoms of a disease associated with a fungus that grows after the accumulation of stools from bats.

A report from the Ministry of Labor revealed that "this activity required workers to use complete protection with a face mask featuring a cartridge offering protection against multiple emission types, since such contaminants generate multiple environmental gases, and such protective materials were not supplied for the workers."

The US Embassy declared that the CDC sent "a rapid response team with epidemiologists and environmental health experts in order to thoroughly investigate and monitor this outbreak."

"Five of the affected workers had to be admitted in an Intensive Care Unit, and unfortunately 3 of them died," reported the diplomatic mission.

A spokesman from the Embassy pointed out that histoplasmosis "is a fungal disease living in the environment, particularly in soil contaminated with stools from birds and bats." He also added that "the 2 remaining hospitalized workers are receiving antifungal drugs."

He also mentioned that "histoplasmosis may be a severe disease in persons with a debilitated immune system, particularly those living with HIV/AIDS, and that this condition is not transmitted from person to person."

[The prior report of this outbreak of histoplasmosis stated that there were 3 deaths among 27 workers who became ill after cleaning bat-infested tunnels at the Bao-Tavera Dam Complex in the Dominican Republic (ProMED-mail post Histoplasmosis - Dominican Republic: (ST) tunnel cleaners 20150918.3654521). The news report above says now that there were 28 workers who developed symptoms of histoplasmosis after cleaning tunnels of the Taveras-Bao dam for 41 days without adequate protection. An investigative team from the U.S. CDC is now involved. We await the results of their investigation.

The Bao-Tavera Dam Complex refers to 2 earth-filled embankment dams located about 15 km (9.3 miles) south of Santiago in Santiago Province of the Dominican Republic; it provides municipal water and water for irrigation, and generates hydroelectric power (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bao-Tavera_Dams).

Santiago is a province in the north of the country (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Province_(Dominican_Republic)). - Mod.ML]
