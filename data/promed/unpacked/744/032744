Sunshine Coast registered nurse [AA] thought she had COVID-19 when she started experiencing a sore throat, runny nose, and aches and pains like she had "never experienced".

However, tests showed she was one of 151 people on the Sunshine Coast diagnosed with Queensland's most prolific mosquito-borne disease -- Ross River virus.

"The aches and pains were so debilitating, standing up and bearing weight on my feet was really excruciating," [AA] said.

"My hands had swollen up to the point where I couldn't get my wedding ring off.

"I just felt really, really, really tired and my mobility was impacted to such an extent that there's no way I could have functioned at work."

Symptoms are similar to COVID-19 including fever, chills, headaches, rashes, rashes, and joint pain.

[AA] had 2 weeks off work, but 6 months later she is still experiencing aches and pains.

After learning the hard way, [AA] urged others to actively reduce their risk of getting the virus.

"It's about public education," she said. "Just speaking to my neighbour ... they've come from down south and they've got no idea about the mosquito-borne illness."

A total of 753 Ross River fever cases have been recorded across Queensland in 2021, which is 75% less than this time last year [2020].

Queensland Health chief medical officer Professor Keith McNeil said Ross River virus infections had grown during COVID, unlike declining malaria and dengue rates.

"Rates rose to the highest levels in 5 years last year [2020], with the majority of cases occurring in South-East Queensland," Professor McNeil said.

"Ross River virus infections account for the largest number of human mosquito-borne disease notifications in Queensland."

Ross River virus can be found in more than 40 different species of mosquitoes across Australia, spread from infected mosquitoes to humans.

While current case numbers were low, Professor McNeil urged people not to become complacent with summer the peak time for Ross River infections.

"Typically, Ross River virus cases begin to rise with the onset of rain and warm temperatures in December before peaking in February and March," he said.

"Cases often occur following above-average rainfall or king tides."

[Ross River virus (RRV) transmission is again occurring in Queensland state, Australia. As noted above, transmission is expected to begin increasing next month, December, so more cases can be expected in the coming weeks. Earlier in the year (2021), a weather forecast in Australia claimed that a La Nina weather event occurring then would likely cause more rain over the coming months, which will create perfect conditions for more mosquito breeding. Now, cases of RRV infection are occurring with the potential for more cases as the summer there continues.

RRV infections occur sporadically across Australia when rains are heavy. RRV infection cases occur at times in Queensland, Victoria, and Western Australia. Making preparations to deal with an increase in vector mosquito populations is prudent, as is informing the population of possible increased risk of infection with advice to avoid mosquito bites.

Common symptoms of Ross River virus infection include fever, joint pain, and feeling tired and generally unwell. There are no effective treatments available for RRV. While most people recover after 2-3 weeks, some cases are very serious, and the infection can leave lingering problems such as arthritis in small joints, like those in the hands and feet, that can persist for weeks, making normal movement difficult.

Ross River virus is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes, including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. - Mod.TY
