1st oseltamivir-resistant influenza (H1N1) virus discovered in Taiwan
---------------------------------------------------------------------
On Tue 20 Oct 20, 2009, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC)
announced the discovery of the 1st oseltamivir-resistant influenza
(H1N1) virus strain in Taiwan. According to statistics announced by
the World Health Organization (WHO), a total of 10 countries have
discovered a total of 35 strains of antiviral-resistant influenza A
(H1N1) virus. According to the epidemiological investigation
conducted by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC), the
1st oseltamivir-resistant influenza A (H1N1) virus strain in Taiwan
was discovered in an individual case and no signs of cluster outbreak
or further transmission have been detected. In addition, CECC has
reported the case to WHO.

The oseltamivir-resistant influenza A (H1N1) virus strain was
isolated from a 20-year-old male who lives in southern Taiwan. The
case developed influenza-like symptoms such as fever and cough on 1
Sep 2009. The case was sent to the hospital and found to be positive
for influenza A by the rapid influenza diagnostic test. The case's
chest x-ray showed signs of pneumonia. The case was hospitalized for
treatment using oseltamivir. Prior to treatment, on 1 Sep 2009, the
specimen collected from the case was sensitive to oseltamivir.
However, the specimen collected from the case on 4 Sep 2009 detected
the H275Y mutation that is resistant to oseltamivir, showing mutation
of the virus after the treatment was administered. After further
treatment, the case has recovered and discharged from the hospital on
20 Sep 2009.

So far, 4 family members of the case of oseltamivir-resistant
influenza A (H1N1) who live in the same household have not developed
influenza-like symptoms. 6 of the 9 cases of influenza A (H1N1) who
live in the same area as the case of oseltamivir-resistant influenza
A (H1N1) are infected with influenza A (H1N1) virus that is sensitive
to oseltamivir, while the other 3 cases had lower viral loads and
could not be tested for oseltamivir sensitivity. Nevertheless, all 9
cases have recovered from the disease.

On the other hand, the case of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A
(H1N1) has come into contact with 45 people during his
hospitalization, but none of the close contacts have developed
influenza-like symptoms such as fever.
Taiwan CDC has conducted antiviral resistance testing on the other
292 strains of influenza A (H1N1) virus isolated from cases that
occurred in Taiwan and none of the 292 strains have shown oseltamivir
resistance, showing that the case of oseltamivir-resistant virus is
sporadic and has not resulted in community transmission. Taiwan CDC
will continue to expand the surveillance of influenza A (H1N1)
antiviral resistance.

According to the latest statistics announced by WHO, a total of 35
strains of antiviral-resistant influenza A (H1N1) virus have been
detected in 10 countries, including Denmark, Japan, Canada, the
United States, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, Brazil, and
Argentina. All the antiviral resistant virus strains were detected in
individual cases. CECC once again urged the public to put on a mask,
seek medical attention immediately, and take medicine according to
the physician's instructions when influenza-like symptoms develop and
refrain from taking self-purchased medicine.

[While the above report does not specify the H1N1 virus involved as a
pandemic strain H1N1, the original report in Chinese specifically
mentions this is the new H1N1 (pandemic strain) (report in original
Chinese available at
<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=25988&ctNode=220&mp=1>)

Oseltamivir resistance evolved during the course of treatment and as
has been observed elsewhere this did not interfere with the recovery
of the patient. As in other situations with both seasonal and
pandemic (H1N1) virus there was no apparent onward transmission of
oseltamivir resistant virus to contacts or any apparent spread of
resistant virus in the community. As in all other cases analysed up
to the present oseltamivir resistance was conferred by the H275Y
mutation in the viral neuraminidase. - Mod.CP]
