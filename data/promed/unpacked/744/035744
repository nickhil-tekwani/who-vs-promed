In 2017, the NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of Sweden has reported several outbreaks of _Synchytrium endobioticum_ (EPPO A2 List). Phytosanitary measures have been taken to eradicate the disease, and laboratory studies will be conducted to identify the race(s).

County of Blekinge
In September 2017 during harvest of potatoes (cv. Quadrigo) grown for starch production, symptoms of potato wart disease were noticed. The infected field (5.5 ha) [13.6 acres] is in the vicinity of an area where _S. e._ race 18 had been recorded before but no longer detected since 2008. Infected tubers were also discovered by a farmer when delivering potatoes (cv. Kuras) to the starch industry. The infected field [is] 1 ha [2.5 acres].

County of Skane
In October 2017, wart disease was noticed on potato tubers at the time of harvest. The infested field [is] (5 ha) [12.3 acres].

County of Vaermlands
In October 2017, during the harvest of ware potatoes (cv. King Edward), a farmer discovered infected tubers.

In 2017, the NPPO of Germany has reported several outbreaks of _S. endobioticum_. Phytosanitary measures have been taken to eradicate the disease.

Baden-Wuerttemberg
In May 2017, _S.e._ was found on a single seed potato harvested in 2016. A demarcated area was established (5.2 ha) [12.8 acres] [where] it is prohibited to grow potatoes or other plants for planting. The source of this outbreak is unknown, but some winter sporangia may have been transferred by birds or wild boars from a nearby field found to be infested by _S. e._ in 2011.

Bavaria
- In February 2017, a grower noticed wart disease in his potato harvest of 2016. By planting differential potato cultivars on the field concerned (2 ha) [4.9 acres], the presence of _S. e._ race 18 was confirmed.

- In August 2017, _S. e._ was found in 3 lots of seed potatoes grown on 15 ha [37 acres]. In October 2017, 1 lot of seed potatoes of the same grower was also found to be infested (4 ha) [9.9 acres] before harvest; 1 additional infested lot was found in November 2017 on 6 ha [14.8 acres] of the same farm. The source of this outbreak is unknown. The fields might have been already infested prior to planting and carry-over might be the reason for the infestation in several fields.

- In October 2017, _S. e._ was found in a lot of seed potatoes during sampling for certification. It is estimated that a plot of 1 ha [2.5 acres] is infected. The source of this outbreak is unknown.

- In October 2017, during tracing forward investigations related to the outbreak in seed potatoes in Baden-Wuerttemberg (above), 2 symptomatic tubers were found.

[Potato wart disease (PW) is caused by the fungus _Synchytrium endobioticum_, which is considered one of the most important pathogens of the crop. It is endemic in Europe and has also been reported from a number of locations in the Americas, Australasia, and Africa. The pathogen can also affect tomato and some solanaceous weeds.

On infected tubers, "eyes" develop into characteristic warty, cauliflower-like swellings. If infected early, the whole tuber can be replaced by a warty proliferation. Warts darken with age and eventually rot and disintegrate. Plant vigour is reduced, and both quantity and quality of harvested tubers are severely affected. Diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation, as similar symptoms can be caused by other pathogens. The fungus goes through cycles of proliferation and re-infection as long as cool, wet conditions prevail and is, therefore, less damaging in warm, light, well drained soils.

The disease is spread with soil (for example on farm tools), by infected seed tubers and also in manure from animals fed on infected potatoes. The fungus can survive in soil for up to 40 years in the absence of a host. Disease management is based on pathogen exclusion by quarantine regulations and the control of local pathogen spread. Fungicides are ineffective, but some experimental fumigation treatments have been shown to kill resting sporangia (see link below).

There are several pathotypes defined by their virulence on different host cultivars. Potato varieties resistant to a number of them have been developed, but new pathogen strains are emerging, compromising the efficacy of host plant resistance.

In the reports above, for Sweden it is concerning that the disease appears in different cultivars. This would indicate either spread via soil between cultivars and therefore long term contamination of the fields, or contaminated seed lines for each of the cultivars which would have to be traced. For Germany, the importance of seed certification is illustrated since contaminated seed lines pose major risks of losses both in yield and international trade.
