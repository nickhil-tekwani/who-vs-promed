[In early July 2013, Mongolia reported 2 outbreaks in the Bayan-Ulgii region, where serotype A was identified. This event marked the 1st occurrence of serotype A in this country. Detailed information and comments on the Bayan-Ulgii event were published recently by ProMED (archives numbers: 20130711.1819287 and 20130709.1814699). The genetic sublineage is still unknown.

According to information obtained from the WAHID database, during 2010 the Dornod region reported 4 outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), all due to serotype O. Details of these outbreaks can be found at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail and http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Immsummary (Note: to view information, you need to scroll down to the name of the disease and time period).

This latest outbreak in Dornod (18 Sep 2013) is the 2nd time that FMD serotype A is reported in Mongolia, but the 1st in East Mongolia. This outbreak in Dornod occurred close to the border with China (Inner Mongolia) and the Russian region of Amur Oblast, where FMD serotype A has been also reported (published by ProMED in early September 2013 -- archive number 20130905.1926139). In Inner Mongolia, serotype Asia 1 has been reported. See http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail (Note: to view information, you need to scroll down to the name of the country, disease and time period).

FMD type A/ASIA Sea-97 sublineage is circulating in the Central/East Asian region in 2012-2013. The recent genetic analysis of FMDV type A (A GDMM-CHA-2013-S(LVRI)), which were collected in March 2013 from cattle and pigs in North China (Chengbey District, Xining, Qinghai) and a Russian strain (A/Zabaikalsky/RUS/2013), collected on 1 Mar 2013 from cattle in Molodezhny, Priargunsky district, Zabaikalsky kray, South-East Russia (close to the Chinese border) revealed a close genetic relationship (both had 99.06 percent genetic identity within VP1 coding region) with FMDV type A virus collected in October 2012 in Southern Thailand (Nakhon Pathom). They all belong to the same type A/ASIA Sea-97 strain of FMDV.

Further details can be found in the document provided by European Commission for the control of FMD, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, in June 2013, available at http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/June_2013_FMD_global_report.pdf. - Mod.CRD
