Scientists at the University of California Davis have discovered a new virus associated with brain inflammation in cattle.

They had considered the usual causes when a yearling steer developed clinical signs consistent with brain and spinal cord inflammation, including rabies virus, herpes viruses, _Histophilus somni_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, which is the causative agent of listeriosis, and sporadic bacterial causes such as salmonella. BSE, the parasite _Neospora caninum_, and non-infectious causes such as lead poisoning and thiamine deficiency, sometimes referred to as polio, were also considered.

Since none of the known causes were found, the scientists then went hunting for novel viruses. They used a new technique called metagenomics to search for virus genes and discovered a new virus, which they called BoAstV-NeuroS1.

Genetic analysis grouped it in the astrovirus family. It is distantly related to other astroviruses that cause diarrhea in infant children and a shaking disease in farmed mink. The scientists' next step was to look back at cases of neurological disease in cattle in which an exact cause was not found. 3/32 cattle that were tested had this new virus in their brain tissue.

Researchers in Switzerland independently found the same virus in cattle with neurological disease, further supporting the discovery.

More research is needed to understand how the new virus is transmitted, what proportion of cattle are exposed, what other countries have infected cattle, and how the virus causes brain disease.

Diagnosing the cause of neurological disease in cattle can be challenging. Clinical signs can include behavior changes such as loss of appetite, teeth grinding, restlessness and increased excitability. More dramatic signs include wobbly gait, loss of balance, blindness, paralysis, head-pressing, inability to stand, seizures, coma and death.

It is important to determine the exact cause when brain inflammation is found during an autopsy. We don't want to miss a case of rabies or BSE. For example, a public health investigation is needed if a heifer is diagnosed with rabies to determine whether people were exposed and require treatment.

The new virus discovery is important because it gives us one more option for which to test. We look at microscopic pieces of brain tissue and can usually confirm or rule out causes such as neospora and bacteria. However, changes to brain tissue all appear pretty much the same when it comes to viruses. It takes additional testing to find out which virus is the cause, but, generally, we have to know what to look for. This is where the virus hunting technology shines.

Metagenomics recently became affordable and fast enough to apply to cases such as the steer in the California study. The technology was originally developed and perfected through the Human Genome Project, which provided the funding to automate these techniques and make them cheaper. As a result, tissues from clinical cases can now be screened for unknown viruses.

Many new viruses has been discovered in recent years. Scientists previously had to grow viruses in cultures, which left a vast number of virus types undiscovered because they cannot be propagated in this way. Other molecular techniques have become available in the last 30 years that didn't require virus culture, but the investigators still had to have a rough idea of what virus types they were looking for. These virus hunters can now "shoot in the dark" and come up with answers.

The astrovirus discovery is just the tip of the iceberg. Metagenomics will quickly open up the world to many bacteria and viruses that were previously unknown. It is an exciting time for infectious disease discovery as science continues to document, explain and understand the natural world around us. Also, veterinary pathologists now have one more virus to test for in cattle with brain inflammation, and perhaps a vaccine can be developed.

[The fact that this work has been repeated and verified in another country provides evidence that this is a real virus. Furthermore, it gives veterinarians another disease to consider in addition to rabies, listeriosis etc., as mentioned earlier in this article.

Hopefully, we will have antemortem tests available soon and current postmortem indicators of this disease. - Mod.TG
