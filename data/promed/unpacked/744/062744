Who Update 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO has received reports of 8 suspected cases including 5 deaths of acute
haemorrhagic fever syndrome in Mbomo district, Cuvette Ouest region (see
previous report:
<http://www.who.int/disease-outbreak-news/n2002/june/19june2002.html> or
ProMED-mail post Ebola hemorrhagic fever - Congo Rep: suspected (03)

Since the last death on 6 Jun 2002, 2 new suspected cases have been
reported in Mbomo. Health authorities have identified more than 40 contacts
of the suspected cases.
The investigation has been hampered by the lack of community cooperation.
