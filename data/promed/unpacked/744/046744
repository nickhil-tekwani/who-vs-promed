We want to add some information on the cluster of food-borne botulism
in 2 Chilean travelers: The father and son as well as the other 3
family members, who stayed asymptomatic, ate from the same takeaway
pizza, made of tomatoes, ham, olives, and cheese. The food was
consumed in their car. As the family reported, the father, who had a
far more severe course of disease, had eaten more pizza than his son.

Since more information on the ingredients of the meal is not
available, we suspect canned tomatoes, olives or ham as possible
sources of this outbreak. It would be interesting to know, if more
cases have been reported in this region of Argentina in recent weeks
and if local investigations have found a source.

We also want to correct a date from our previous report. The 2
patients had arrived in July 2011 at our hospital (and not as stated
in June). The intoxication took place on 24 Jul 2011.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Weitzel and his colleagues for additional
information on the cases of botulism. It is not surprising that the
father, who ate more of the pizza, had more severe disease. The pizza
had ham and olives on it in addition to the mostly obligatory cheese
and tomato, the latter probably in the form of sauce. Olives would be
the most likely vehicle of the botulinum toxin. As stated, it would be
important to know if additional cases of botulism have been reported
in that area of Argentina. Again, it would be important to know if the
olives were cured commercially or at home. Also, since the botulinum
toxin is heat-labile, was there a problem in the pizza oven or was it
a "rush" order, so that the pizza was not adequately cooked? - Mod.LL]
