The city has witnessed 200 cases of [H1N1] in the 1st 5 months of the year [2019], the highest since 2016. There have been 2 deaths owing to the virus in March 2019.

While there were no cases reported between January and May in 2018, 70 cases (3 deaths) were reported in 2017, and 2 cases in 2016. Doctors, however, claimed the outbreak is "under control."

The number of cases has dropped from 85 in March to 47 in April and 29 in May [2019], according to the epidemiology cell of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). There were 39 [H1N1] cases reported in February [2019].

Doctors said fluctuations in weather conditions or changes in virus strains may be the causes behind the large number of H1N1 cases reported this year [2019]. "The drop in cases is a positive sign. The spread of the infection is in control, and there is no cause to worry. We suspect that the high numbers could be owing to climatic change, but further studies need to be done to confirm it," said Dr Padmaja Keskar, executive health officer, BMC. In Mumbai, the virus is known to be prevalent during the post-monsoon and winter seasons, when cooler conditions are conducive to the spread of the virus.

After the widespread [H1N1] outbreak in 2015 across the country -- during which Mumbai reported 1815 cases and 19 deaths in the period between January and May [2015] -- fewer cases have been reported. Effective vaccination programmes are said to be a major reason behind the control of the infection. Dr P Awte, state surveillance officer, Directorate of Health Services, who heads the vaccination program in the state, said that the focus would be on vulnerable population groups during vaccination. "Patients with immunodeficiency disorders or lifestyle diseases, children, pregnant women and senior citizens are the worst hit, so our surveillance is focused around them," said Dr Awte.

"We have also procured more than [125 000] [H1N1] vaccines, which we started dispensing from April 2019," he said. Last year [2018], more than [155 000] people were vaccinated against the flu in the state.

The primary symptoms of [H1N1] include fever, lethargy, headache, cough, sore throat, and nausea. While most people recover within a week, it can get complicated for people with low immunity and chronic diseases.

Asylum seekers arriving in San Diego receive a medical screening upon entering the shelter, are assessed for their clinical needs, and then treated as appropriate. Those determined to have influenza-like symptoms are isolated in local hotel rooms with individual heating and air conditioning units. Accompanying family members are quarantined with their relatives and are also given treatment to prevent them from getting sick and spreading the virus.

With continued arrival of migrants to the shelter with influenza-like symptoms, all migrants without symptoms are also receiving treatment to prevent them from getting sick.

County and migrant center medical staff visit patients daily in their hotel rooms to continue monitoring their symptoms, address medical needs, and assess when they are well enough to travel.

23 May 2019 Update
San Diego County Public Health officials are responding to an influenza outbreak among asylum seekers recently flown to San Diego from Texas by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

"We have identified individuals with flu symptoms and are providing appropriate treatment," said Dr. Dean Sidelinger, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer, adding that 16 asylum seekers have been reported with influenza-like illness.

"Those who are ill are being isolated, along with members of their families. Our staff, in conjunction with those of Jewish Family Services and others, are following established procedures to ensure these individuals and their families are well before they leave San Diego for other destinations," Sidelinger said.

Asylum seekers, primarily families, began arriving in San Diego County in October 2018 and from Texas on 19 May 2019. To date, more than 14 000 individuals who are legally in the country have been screened.

"We are taking all the appropriate steps that we can to contain this outbreak at this facility and to protect the public's health in San Diego," said County Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Dianne Jacob.

In January 2019, the County Board of Supervisors authorized using a closed downtown courthouse as a temporary shelter. It was refurbished and opened in March 2019.

"Our early efforts to create a safe and professionally-staffed shelter for legal migrant families has protected the greater San Diego region," said County Supervisor Nathan Fletcher. "Our rigorous screening process and attentive medical staff is what has allowed us to quickly identify this issue and take steps to address it."

An outbreak in a single setting is defined as at least one individual diagnosed with influenza and another coming down with a flu-like illness within 72 hours. Outbreaks are usually seen in skilled nursing or other long-term care facilities, but also can occur in other group homes/congregate living facilities, such as detention facilities or overnight camps. San Diego County has experienced 27 outbreaks this flu season.

As asylum seekers continue to arrive from Texas and California, shelter operators will continue screenings and the isolation and treatment of anyone who is symptomatic. It can take up to 4 days after exposure for flu signs to appear. The county will provide updates on this outbreak until it concludes.

[4] Cook Islands

Two cases of influenza A which has caused deaths in Australia and New Zealand have been reported in the Cook Islands.

This was confirmed by the Ministry of Health's director Hospital Health Services, Dr Yin Yin May.

Dr May said that so far, 12 cases have been identified. These cases were tested around mid-May 2019, and specimens were sent to New Zealand for confirmation.

She said the results found that there were 2 influenza A cases and 4 flu B cases so far. She said the 1st flu A case diagnosed was a visitor from New Zealand.

In Australia, influenza A has caused a massive impact this year [2019] where around 35 people have died. In New Zealand, 2 died from influenza a month into the flu season, according to staff.

Dr May said they would send further specimens for testing if more cases are identified. She explained that when the flu virus was identified, they had to make sure that they differentiated the flu virus from the dengue virus. Therefore, tests are sent to NZ.

Dr May explained that preliminary tests are also conducted at the Rarotonga Hospital. Symptoms include fever, a high temperature of around 38 C [100 F], coughs, sore throat, stuffy nose, body aches, headaches, vomiting and upset stomach.

The incubation period is one to 4 days, and symptoms, especially continuous coughing, will begin to show.

Dr May said this is a normal flu, but those who are at high risk and could have complications such as death are pregnant women, mothers who have just had a baby recently, those with ongoing medical problems such as chronic asthma, diabetes and obese people and those who are more than 65 years of age.

She said influenza A is worse than the B virus, and the best way to prevent this is to practice good hygiene.

She said in 2017, some influenza vaccines were brought in for medical staff and this was subsidised. This year [2019], Dr May said under the new secretary of health, influenza vaccines are provided for all the health staff to prevent them from getting infected or to spread it to the public. She said they would later consider aged people. She said the vaccines were received 2 weeks ago, and they have begun to immunize their staff.

Meanwhile, home remedies for individuals with a flu are that you must stay home, avoid contact with other people where possible, keep warm and rest, consume plenty of liquids, avoid alcohol, and stop smoking. Flu vaccines/flu shots are also available at private pharmacies; however, one must get advice from a doctor 1st.

[5] Australia - Vaccine Shortage

https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/unprecedented-number-of-flu-cases-cause-vaccine-shortage/11184414


The unusually high number of flu cases in Australia this season is leading to shortages of the vaccine. According to the most recent figures, there have been more than 55 000 notifications of influenza this year [2019], and the numbers are climbing steeply.

At least 119 people have died, including young children and the elderly. That's forced the government to order 400 000 more vaccines for the private market.
