Areas near Quito quarantined to halt foot-and-mouth disease
-----------------------------------------------
Quito, 16 Jun 2002 - The Ecuadorian Agricultural Health Service (SESA) has
declared the cattle-raising areas northwest of Quito under quarantine due
to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD).
SESA said all the towns in northwestern Pichincha province, the capital
of which is Quito, would be quarantined beginning Monday because of the
outbreak. The measure would also be imposed in the town of El Carmen, in
the western coastal province of Manabi, the daily La Hora said. SESA has
detected at least 34 cases of FMD in Pichincha's northwestern
cattle-raising area and 3 more in El Carmen.
"We have to keep (the disease) from spreading to other areas," the director
of the National Commission for the Eradication of Foot-and-Mouth Disease
(CONEFA), Medardo Lasso, said. Lasso said members of agricultural health
organizations, as well as the police, would attempt to control the spread
of the disease and implement a vaccination program. The movement of cattle
into and out of the affected areas is strictly prohibited. In the rest of
the country, only ranchers who possess a vaccination certification granted
by CONEFA are permitted to transport cattle.
"It's important for cattle raisers to vaccinate their cattle and for cattle
traders to comply with health regulations on the sale and transport (of
these animals), because the illegal movement of cattle facilitates the
spread of the disease," Lasso said.
FMD is endemic in Ecuador and has led in the past to the mass slaughter of
cattle. Over the past several years, a national campaign to control and
eradicate the disease has been waged in hopes of preventing another crisis.
