A broiler breeder farm with 35 000 birds in Metzer (near Ma'anit, Central Israel) has been diagnosed with highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8.

The property has been quarantined, and movement controls are in place to stop any birds, eggs, and equipment from leaving the premises. A Restricted Area (3 km) [1.86 mi] is in place around the property, and a Control Area (10 km) [6.21 mi] across a wider area has also been created. The farm will be depopulated.

[This is the 1st HPAI H5N8 event of the season [2020], probably introduced by migrating birds.

Israel experienced its most recent case of HPAI H5N8 on 27 Jan 2020, when a Bonelli's Eagle (_Aquila fasciata_) was found with neurological signs in the Jordan valley. The eagle had a transmitter, so it could be established that on 1 Jan 2020 it entered the Jordan valley from the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and, from then on, stayed in the Jordan valley, on the Israeli side of the Jordan river. The eagle was brought alive to the Wildlife hospital in the Safari of Ramat-Gan and was put there in quarantine, eventually euthanized on 3 Feb 2020. This case was reported to the OIE; see, with map, at
https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=33117.

For the location of the current case, in Kibbutz Metzer (Haifa district), see map at https://tinyurl.com/yxry3znw.

Israel is located on main flyways of migrating birds. In the autumn, mainly September to November, extremely large numbers of birds leave their nesting grounds in Europe and Asia and cross Israel on their way to the wintering grounds in Africa.

Alertness is warranted in the Eastern Mediterranean region. - Mod.AS
