Thailand, Novel Coronavirus - 2nd case, 17 Jan 2020
---------------------------------------------------
Ministry of Public Health screening for travelers from Wuhan City, People's Republic of China found confirmed coronavirus pneumonia of the 2019 strain from a 2nd individual, which is currently under medical supervision at Bamrasnaradura Institute waiting for the results of repeated lab tests. There has been no outbreak of the new strain of the coronavirus in Thailand.

Today ([17 Jan 2020]) at the Department of Disease Control of the Ministry of Public Health in Nonthaburi Province, Dr. Sukhum Kanchanapimai, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Public Health, together with Dr. Suwanchai Wattana Yingcharoenchai, Director-General of the Department of Disease Control, are announcing the situation of people with pneumonia from Wuhan, China, said the Ministry of Public Health. The Department of Disease Control has screened travelers at the airport on [13 Jan 2020], with one additional confirmed case of coronavirus pneumonia from 2019 in a Chinese female aged 74 years. She is currently at the Bamrasnaradura Institute under medical supervision and is showing clinical improvement. If laboratory tests do not detect virus, she will be discharged from the hospital. This is the 2nd case of laboratory-confirmed [novel CoV2019 infection] in Thailand; the 2 parties are not related.

Dr. Sukhum continued that the Ministry of Public Health have carried out surveillance and disease control according to the standard system used for emerging communicable diseases. By screening passengers flying directly from Wuhan, China, at 4 airports, including Suvarnabhumi, Don Mueang, Chiang Mai and Phuket, from 3-16 Jan 2020, a total of 86 flights, 13 624 passengers and crew were screened. Most of the 21 patients who were eligible for the investigation were infected with the influenza virus. A total of 12 patients were treated and returned home. Two patients suffering from pneumonia from the novel coronavirus are still in a treatment room with negative pressure in the Bamrasnaradura Institute.

With the 1st confirmed patient, symptoms have improved a lot, and he no longer has a fever. We are waiting for double confirmation that no virus can be transmitted. The doctor will then allow the patient to go home. As well as the 2nd patient who is currently undergoing treatment and follow up until symptoms disappear. At reinspection, if no virus is found, then the case will be able to return home. The 1st group of patients tested included 16 patients and the 2nd group included 20 persons. No close contacts were found with the new strains of the coronavirus. People do not have to panic in Thailand; there is no outbreak at all.

The Ministry of Public Health also confirmed the public readiness. Both surveillance and epidemic prevention measures in 4 areas are as follows:
1. Ability to monitor disease screening and screening of patients, by screening plane passengers on direct flights from Wuhan City, People's Republic of China
2. Diagnosis and care of patients who are within the investigation criteria
3. Refer patients that meet the criteria to be observed in the negative-pressure room in both public and private hospitals
4. Surveillance in tourist communities around the country

Currently, the World Health Organization has not yet announced a ban on travel to countries where pneumonia is reported. We are asking people to follow the situation closely. If you need to travel to a risky area, be careful. Avoid contact with animals, especially in markets for trading of animals or animal products, or in a crowded place. If coming back from a risky area and one begins to experience symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, seek immediate medical attention of health personnel. Due to the possibility of pneumonia complications, however, people are an important part in cooperation with the government. If found suspected, we recommend hospital treatment or consult with the Department of Disease Control hotline 1422.

[Our submitter Dan Schar commented: "This 2nd case that is epidemiologically unconnected with the 1st traveler-imported case raises important questions around unrecognized human-to-human transmission." I am in full agreement with Dan Schar here. Sticking my neck out to the chopping block, I suspect there may already be significant ongoing transmission of this novel CoV, but fortunately the overwhelming majority of cases are presenting with relatively mild and self-limited symptoms of fever, sore throat and cough, a common presentation during the high season for febrile respiratory illnesses. Many people do not seek medical attention or when seen are given the diagnosis of viral syndrome. I obviously hope I am correct here. - Mod.MPP]

Novel coronavirus - Japan (ex-China) 17 Jan 2020
------------------------------------------------
On [15 Jan 2020], the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan (MHLW) reported an imported case of laboratory-confirmed 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

The case-patient is male, between the age of 30-39 years, living in Japan.

The case-patient travelled to Wuhan, China in late December [2019] and developed fever on [3 Jan 2020] while staying in Wuhan. He did not visit the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market or any other live animal markets in Wuhan. He has indicated that he was in close contact with a person with pneumonia.

On [6 Jan 2020], he traveled back to Japan and tested negative for influenza when he visited a local clinic on the same day.

On [10 Jan 2020], due to his continued symptoms of cough, sore throat and fever, he visited a local hospital and was found to have abnormal chest x-ray with infiltrates. He was admitted to the hospital on the same day and had remained febrile until [14 Jan 2020]. On [14 Jan 2020], his attending doctor notified the case to a local public health authority under the surveillance system for "Unidentified Serious Infectious Illness."

Samples were collected and sent to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), and at NIID, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and sequencing was performed twice, which identified very small amount of 2019-nCoV RNA on [15 Jan 2020].

On [15 Jan 2020], the case-patient was afebrile and was discharged from hospital. Currently, he is staying at home in a stable condition.

Public health response
- Contact tracing and other epidemiological investigations are underway by the local health authorities in Japan;
- The Japanese Government has scaled up a whole-of-government coordination mechanism on [16 Jan 2020];
- The MHLW has strengthened surveillance for undiagnosed severe acute respiratory illnesses since the report of undiagnosed pneumonia in Wuhan, China;
- From [6 Jan 2020], MHLW requested local health governments to be aware of the respiratory illnesses in Wuhan by using the existing surveillance system for serious infectious illness with unknown etiology;
- NIID is supporting local authorities on epidemiologic investigations including contact tracing;
- Quarantine and screening measures have been enhanced for travelers from Wuhan city at the point of entries since [7 Jan 2020];
- NIID established an in-house PCR assay for nCoV on [16 Jan 2020];
- Revision of the risk assessment by NIID is being conducted, including case definition of close contacts;
- The public risk communication has been enhanced;
- A hotline has been established among the different ministries in the government;
- The MHLW is working closely with WHO and other related Member States to foster mutual investigations and information sharing.

WHO risk assessment
This was the 2nd of 3 exported cases of novel coronavirus from Wuhan city, China. Since the initial report of cases in Wuhan city on [31 Dec 2019], and as of [12 Jan 2020], 41 laboratory-confirmed cases of nCoV infection, including 2 deaths in cases with underlying medical conditions, have been reported to WHO. Two cases have been reported from Thailand.

The source of the outbreak is still under investigation in Wuhan. Preliminary investigations have identified environmental samples positive for nCoV in Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan City; however, some laboratory-confirmed patients did not report visiting this market. To date, there is no reported infection among healthcare workers in China, Thailand or Japan. No additional cases have been reported since [3 Jan 2020] in China [see section [4] below].

Additional investigations are needed to determine how the patients were infected, whether human-to-human transmission has been observed, mode(s) of transmission, the clinical spectrum of disease, and the extent of infection, including presence of subclinical cases that are undetected with current surveillance.

It is critical to review all available information to fully understand the extent of transmissibility between people and likelihood of zoonotic spillover.

WHO advice
Although the source of the novel coronavirus causing this cluster of pneumonia and the mode(s) of transmission are unknown, it would be prudent to remind populations and health workers of the basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections:
- Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections;
- Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment;
- Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals;
- People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands);
- Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in emergency departments;
- WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travelers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness either during or after travel, the travelers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their healthcare provider. Travel guidance has been updated.
- Health authorities should work with travel, transport and tourism sectors to provide travellers with information to reduce the general risk of acute respiratory infections via travel health clinics, travel agencies, conveyance operators and at points of entry.

WHO has provided interim guidance for novel coronaviruses (https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus).

WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Japan based on the information currently available on this event.

[Information contained in a previous post from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare noted the person with symptoms of pneumonia this individual had close contact with was his father. It is unclear if his father is part of the group of now 45 (see below) confirmed cases of novel CoV infection in Wuhan City, Hubei, China or if his father had contact in the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market.

As mentioned above and in many other official and unofficial documents on this outbreak and novel coronavirus, we are very early in learning about this virus in terms of epidemiology (host and possible intermediary host), demographics of cases, clinical spectrum of disease including demographics of severe clinical presentations, and transmissibility of the virus, to mention a few. Remember, on a global level, we've only known about this outbreak for less than 3 weeks, and about the virus approximately 10 days. - Mod.MPP]

Novel coronavirus - Japan (ex-China) 16 Jan 2020
------------------------------------------------
The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare today [16 Jan 2020] informed the World Health Organization (WHO) of a confirmed case of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in a person who travelled to Wuhan, China. This is the 2nd confirmed case of 2019-nCoV that has been detected outside of China, following confirmation of a case in Thailand on [13 Jan 2020]. Considering global travel patterns, additional cases in other countries are likely.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. 2019-nCoV is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.

Much remains to be understood about the new coronavirus, which was 1st identified in China earlier this month [January 2020]. Not enough is known about 2019-nCoV to draw definitive conclusions about how it is transmitted, clinical features of disease, or the extent to which it has spread. The source also remains unknown.

WHO encourages all countries to continue preparedness activities. On [10 Jan 2020], WHO published information on how to monitor for cases, treat patients, prevent onward transmission in healthcare facilities, maintain necessary supplies, and communicate with the public about 2019-nCoV. The information includes advice on how to maintain hand and respiratory hygiene, and safe food and market practices. WHO is developing and updating this information in consultation with networks of experts across the globe.

WHO's interim guidance and other information on coronaviruses can be found here (https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus).

WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions based on the information available. If travellers develop respiratory illness before, during or after travel, they should seek medical attention and share travel history with their healthcare provider.

Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Committee's report on pneumonia of new coronavirus infection
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At 04:00 on [16 Jan 2020], 3 patients were discharged from the hospital and no new deaths were reported. After comprehensive research and judgment on the clinical manifestations, epidemiological history, and laboratory test results of the national, provincial and municipal expert groups, 4 new cases of [pneumonia] infected with the novel coronavirus have been added in our city. At present, the new cases have been arranged for transfer to Wuhan. All cases were treated at Jinyintan Hospital. All the patients were in stable condition without critical illness. The time of onset of the cases was concentrated from [5-8 Jan 2020]. Related epidemiological investigations and search of close contacts are underway.

In addition, Thailand and Japan each reported a case of pneumonia with a new coronavirus infection from Wuhan. Currently, Thai-diagnosed cases are being hospitalized; Japanese-diagnosed cases have been discharged. Close contacts in the country are conducting follow-up and medical observations.

As of now, 45 cases of pneumonia with new-type coronavirus infection have been reported in our city: 15 cases have been cured and discharged, 5 cases are being treated in severe cases, and 2 cases have died. The remaining patients are in stable condition. All patients received isolation treatment at designated medical institutions in Wuhan. A total of 763 close contacts have been tracked, 665 medical observations have been lifted, and 98 people are still receiving medical observations. Among the close contacts, no related cases were found.

[It is not surprising that additional cases have been identified in Wuhan where this outbreak appears to have begun, especially with the identification of cases in other countries in individuals travelling from Wuhan, China. One wonders if there are cases in other provinces of China that haven't been identified as yet. We await further information from China as to whether screening in other locations outside of Wuhan has begun. - Mod.MPP]

[5] USA/CDC will begin screening - media report
Date: Fri 17 Jan 2020
Source: The New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/17/health/china-coronavirus-airport-screening.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes


Airports in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles will begin screening passengers arriving from Wuhan, China, for infection with a mysterious respiratory virus that has killed 2 people and sickened at least 45 overseas, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced on Friday [17 Jan 2020].

Most people with the disease are believed to have contracted it from exposure to animals at a market that sells seafood and meat in Wuhan, and it is not certain that the virus spreads from person to person. But a few cases have not been linked to animals, and researchers say some human-to-human transmission may be possible, so precautions are necessary.

About 100 experts from the CDC are being deployed to the 3 airports. The 1st flight to be screened will arrive at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport on Friday [17 Jan 2020] night, Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's division of global migration and quarantine, said at a news briefing.

JFK is the only airport in New York where the screening will take place. Screening at San Francisco International and Los Angeles International will begin on Saturday [18 Jan 2020].

Over the next few weeks, some 5000 passengers are likely to be screened, Dr. Cetron said.

From 60 000 to 65 000 people a year travel from Wuhan to the USA. Only New York and San Francisco receive direct flights from Wuhan; those passengers arriving in Los Angeles are on connecting flights.

"I think it's highly plausible there will be a case in the United States," said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases in Atlanta, GA.

Travelers will be asked to fill out questionnaires asking if they have symptoms like cough or fever, and whether they have visited meat or seafood markets in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.

Screeners will also use thermal scanners that can be pointed at the forehead or temple to look for fever. People with signs of the illness will be examined further, and those who seem likely to be infected will be sent on to area hospitals for further testing. Dr. Cetron declined to say which hospitals they would be sent to.

The illness was 1st reported in late December [2019] in Wuhan, in central China. Fears of a more widespread outbreak arose this week when 2 cases were found in Thailand and one in Japan, apparently carried to those countries by air travelers from Wuhan.

The disease is caused by a coronavirus, a member of a family of viruses that can cause respiratory ailments ranging from colds to pneumonia.

A different coronavirus caused the SARS outbreak in 2003, which originated in China and was spread to other countries by travelers, infecting more than 8000 people and killing nearly 800.

A coronavirus is also the cause of MERS, another severe respiratory ailment that has been present in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries since 2012. The MERS virus is carried by camels, and most cases have come from contact with the animals, but infected people can spread it to one another. The death rate has been high, from 30% to 40% of cases.
