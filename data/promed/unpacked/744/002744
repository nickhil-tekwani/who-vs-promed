3 more people have been infected with Rift Valley fever (RVF) this
morning [31 mar 2010], bringing the total to 69 laboratory confirmed
human cases since the 1st incident on 13 Feb 2010; 2 deaths have been
reported, both from the Free State. [Now 82 cases/5 deaths -- see [2]
below].

The National Institute of Communicable Disease (NICD) reported this
morning [31 Mar 2010] that of the 69 cases of infected people, 58
cases and 2 deaths are from Free State, 4 in Eastern Cape, and 7 in
Northern Cape.
Direct contact with RVF-infected livestock and/or linked to farms with
confirmed animal cases of RVF, remain the main risk factor for the
infection. The human cases are farmers, veterinarians, and farm
workers. Additional suspect cases are currently being tested.

Outbreak investigations by the Department of Health and the Department
of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries are ongoing, supported by the
South African Field Epidemiology and Training Programme (SA-FELTP) and
the NICD.

Affected farms are primarily clustered within Free State (initially in
Lejweleputswa District, Bultfontein area); however animal cases of RVF
have been confirmed in all districts with spill over into Eastern
Cape, Northern Cape, and Gauteng. The Department of Agriculture in
Free State has started the vaccination of animals, to contain the
spread of the virus. RVF is a viral disease that can cause severe
illness in a small proportion of infected humans. The virus is
transmitted by mosquitoes and causes outbreaks of abortion and deaths
of young livestock (sheep, goats and cattle). It is important to note
that humans become infected from contact with infected tissues of
livestock and less frequently from mosquito bites. The disease occurs
throughout Africa and Madagascar when exceptionally heavy rains favour
the breeding of the mosquito vectors.

Clinical features in humans
---------------------------
Typically illness is asymptomatic or mild in the vast majority of
infected persons, and severe disease would be expected to occur in
less than 1 percent of infected persons.

Key symptoms
------------
- The incubation period (interval from infection to onset of symptoms)
for RVF varies from two to six days
- Sudden onset of flu-like fever and/or muscle pain
- Some patients develop neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, loss of
appetite and vomiting
- Symptoms of RVF usually last from 4-7 days, after which time the
immune response becomes detectable with the appearance of antibodies
and the virus gradually disappears from the blood.

Severe form of RVF in humans includes
- Vision disturbances
- Intense headache, loss of memory, hallucinations, confusion,
disorientation, vertigo, convulsions, lethargy and coma
- Haemorrhagic fever.

The public living in the affected areas is encouraged to seek medical
attention at their nearest Health facilities, should they have any of
the symptoms above.

Preventive measures
------------------
- While there is no specific treatment, the majority of persons
affected will recover completely. People should avoid contact with the
tissues of infected animals, refrain from drinking unpasteurised milk
and prevent mosquito bites to avoid becoming infected
- Farmers and veterinarians should wear protective clothing when
handling sick animals or their tissues. There is no routine vaccine
available for humans.

So far 5 people have died and 82 others countrywide are infected with
Rift Valley fever, the Ministry of Health said yesterday [Fri 2 Apr
2010]. Nine [sic] new infections have been detected since the virus
[disease] broke out on 13 Feb 2010.

Free State was the worst hit [province] with 4 deaths and 66
infections, followed by the Northern Cape with 1 death and 10 people
infected.

Rift Valley fever virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes
abortion in and deaths of young livestock. Farmers, veterinarians, and
farm workers are mostly affected. Direct contact with infected animals
remains the main risk factor for the infection, the department stated.

[The 1st report indicates the number of human cases increased from 63
to 69 between 27 and 31 Mar 2010. The 2nd report indicates that by 2
Apr 2010 the number of human cases had risen to 82 and the number of
fatalities had increased from 2 to 5 during this period.

These figures indicate that the outbreak first detected in
mid-February 2010 is now spreading rapidly although still restricted
manly to Free State province.

The last major outbreak of RVF on the interior plateau of South Africa
occurred in 1974-76 during prolonged heavy rains, causing 10 000 to 20
000 human cases. Since then, sporadic outbreaks and human infections
have been documented within KwaZulu-Natal, the Kruger National Park,
Limpopo, Gauteng, North West, and Northern Cape Provinces.
