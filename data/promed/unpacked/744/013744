Pig producers are being urged to be extra vigilant following confirmation of a new case of swine dysentery in Yorkshire.

The disease was identified by clinical signs and subsequently confirmed by laboratory tests on a pig unit in North Yorkshire last [Thu 26 Oct 2017].

AHDB [Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board] Pork is advising producers that increased vigilance for the development of clinical signs of disease within their herd should be observed.

"It is important that a heightened level of biosecurity and monitoring for clinical signs are observed over the next few weeks," it said.

Swine dysentery (SD; also known as "bloody scours") is a mucohemorrhagic diarrheal disease of pigs that affects the large intestine. Its essential causal agent is _Brachyspira hyodysenteriae_, an anaerobic spirochete that produces a hemolysin, although other organisms may contribute to the severity of lesions. It is endemic in many pig rearing countries, where control is limited by the lack of effective vaccines and by the emergence of _B. hyodysenteriae_ strains with reduced susceptibility to common antibiotics.

SD is not included in OIE's international list of notifiable diseases.
