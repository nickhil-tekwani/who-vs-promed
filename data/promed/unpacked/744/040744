Health officials believe an _E. coli_ outbreak which has left seven
children in hospital has now been contained. Four pupils from Macduff
Primary School in north-east Scotland are in a stable condition at the
Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital with the
potentially deadly _E. coli_ 0157 infection.
Three classmates are also in hospital with the symptoms, and an eighth
suspected case is being treated at home. All the children are believed to
be aged about eight.
A spokesman for Grampian Health Board said one possible source of infection
was a small, one-off batch of home-made goats' cheese, which is not
available commercially.
The cheese was made by a pupil's grandparent and was taken to school as
part of a class project. Information has been sent to all parents and
youngsters in the affected
class have been asked to provide samples for testing.
