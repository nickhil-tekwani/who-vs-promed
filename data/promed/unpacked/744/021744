A 66.9 per cent increase in malaria cases in Venezuela has recently been reported, corresponding to an accumulated case toll of 31 696 affected subjects across the country, and 1677 new cases were recorded during the last epidemiological week (13th), 29 Mar-4 Apr 2015. Consequently, this tropical disease is still within the definition of an epidemic. Of all new cases, 1660 are native from Bolivar and Amazonas States, and 17 are said to be imported cases from Colombia, Brazil, and Guyana.

From the official report, of all new malaria cases, 76 per cent correspond to a relatively mild form of the disease (_Plasmodium vivax_), and 23.53 per cent correspond to the more severe form (_Plasmodium falciparum_), which may lead to kidney failure and brain edema, explained Dr Pedro Navarro, professor of tropical medicine from the Universidad Central of Venezuela. He also mentioned that although the number of cases of this latter type of malaria are lower, they increased "from 20 to 30 per cent only during the last year."

Both regional and national health authorities were unavailable when we asked them about the measures already taken in order to counteract this situation. Despite the many phone calls we made, no interview was possible.

Of all cases reported during the last epidemiological week, 80.4 per cent (1335) are located in 7 municipalities in Bolivar State, and the remaining cases are located in Amazonas, Falcon, and Apure States, according to a bulletin issued by the General Direction of Environmental Health, a division of the Ministry of Health. Malaria is a rural endemic disease.

80 per cent of reports are located in Bolivar State, specifically in Sifontes municipality, where there is a concentration of cases because of the so-called "gold fever", where miners work in the open field, in inadequate labor camps, with no bednets or other protective measures that may impede anopheles mosquitoes from biting. The aforementioned vectors become infected by plasmodium parasites, and when they bite humans in order to obtain their blood meal, they transmit the infection, said Dr Navarro. These insects bite between dusk and dawn, when temperatures are lower.

Establishing a sanitary barrier in Sifontes Municipality in Bolivar State may control this condition, since malaria is limited to this area, but because mining activities are out of control, it is a state problem, the specialist pointed out, suggesting that both the army and healthcare authorities should intervene. "There should be a coordinated effort looking for a consensus in order to reach a solution", Dr Navarro stated.

Impregnated bednets with long-acting insecticides are one of the most frequently recommended measures for protecting persons from malaria in public health programs. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends all those at risk use such bednets; and, in most places, the most practical way for getting such bednets is through distribution by local agencies, so that residents in high-transmission areas may sleep every night under cover.

Imported malaria cases have been reported in Carabobo, reported Dr Navarro; so this means such cases occur in people who frequently travel to endemic areas, such as the Gran Sabana, and for this reason, malaria is also included within so-called "travelers' diseases". He recommended that people travelling to such endemic areas take malaria chemoprophylaxis in advance.

The Malaria Unit in Carabobo administers malaria chemoprophylaxis, a safe way to be protected. Imported malaria cases have also been reported in Vigia, La Fria (Los Andes), and Santa Barbara del Zulia.

It is regrettable for Venezuelan tropical medicine that malaria is still present, Dr Navarro pointed out. In Mora Municipality there is a monument showing the figure of an anopheles mosquito, as a symbol of the achievements by Professor Arnoldo Gabaldon, who was minister of health during the 1950s. He developed a strong campaign against malaria, and Mora Municipality was one of the most endemic areas in Venezuela at that time. Intensive DDT fumigation and educational measures led to malaria control in Venezuela, and in 1961 it was declared a malaria-free country by WHO.

Malaria may be lethal in both children and pregnant women, but it may be cured with the use of chloroquine combined with artemisinin, which are supplied by the Ministry of Health, explained Dr Navarro. The main way for reducing malaria transmission in communities is by combating the vector. "On an individual level, personal protection against mosquito bites is the first line of defense."

[A map of the distribution of malaria in Venezuela is found in the 2014 World Malaria Report (http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2014/wmr-2014-profiles.pdf), on page 161. 35 per cent are _P. falciparum_ and 65 per cent _P. vivax_. The number of registered cases has slowly but steadily increased since 2008, although mortality has continued to decrease. - Mod.EP
