The saiga antelopes are dying in the western Kazakhstan
-------------------------------------------------------
On May 20, 2010 about 1200 corpses of antelopes were found in the
Western Kazakhstan Oblast, AMI Novosti-Kazakhstan reports with the
reference to press-service of Ministry of Agriculture. At the same
time, this message has not been posted at the ministry website --
perhaps, the press-service prefers the targeted spread of information
instead of reaching wider audience.

Earlier the emergency ministry reported the death of about 200
saigas. According to the Western Kazakhstan Oblast state inspection
forest and hunting department, on 18 May 2010 about 100 dead bodies
of saigas were found in the area of Karaoba, Janibek, Talovka settlements.

The specially established committee started the investigation of the
matter on 20 May 2010. It revealed over 1000 dead bodies (mainly
female saiga) in the Janibek district.

The inspectors affirm that on 15-17 May 2010 they observed some
"strangely grey fog" in the above-mentioned area, although the
weather was clear. "The external examination of the dead bodies
revealed the abdominal distention, foam and diarrhea. The dead bodies
were delivered to the laboratory," the message specifies.

The Prosecutor General's office, the ministries of internal affairs,
defense, environmental protection, education and science, Western
Kazakhstan Oblast Akimat all are informed about the accident.

In the last 20 years the saiga population in Kazakhstan shrank by
24.7 times. In 2009 there were about 81 000 saigas versus about 1
million in 2000, Kazakhstan Today reports. On the other hand, it was
reported in February of 2010 that thanks to the appropriate measures
the number of saigas is gradually growing. According to Kazinform,
the number of saigas in Kazakhstan increased from 21 000 to 81 000
during 2003-2009.

There are 3 types of saiga population in Kazakhstan: Betpakdol
(domestic population that never left Kazakshtan), Ural (Western
Kazakhstan Oblast, occasionally visiting Russian territory) and
Ustyurt (Aktobe Oblast, migrating to Uzbekistan in the winter).

The dead bodies of the saiga were the part of Ural population (prior
to the accident there were about 26.6 thousand of them).

Saiga is listed in the International Red book.

[While a toxicological etiology has been mentioned, mass mortalities
of Saiga antelopes (known in the previous USSR as "Saigak," _Saiga
tartarica tartarica_) were, in the past, also caused by climatic
conditions and infectious diseases, particularly FMD. One such major
outbreak was reported from Kazakhstan during the late 1960's. The
disease spread along the north-south annual migration route of the
animals, at that time counting several hundred thousands. Among the
signs observed was the loss of horns and hooves, and considerable
mortality (Ref 1). FMD appears to cause in the Saiga more severe
disease than in domestic ruminants. Mortality in saigas
experimentally infected with FMDV can be up to 75 percent, and as
much as 10 percent of the free-living population has died during
natural outbreaks (Ref 2).

Results of the epidemiological investigations, including
toxicological, bacterial and virological, are anticipated with interest.

For background information on Saigas and their conservation,
including pictures, see <http://www.zgf.de/?id=65&projectId=40&language=en>).

The numbers of dead animals, as quoted in the newswire, deserve to be
taken cautiously, as a rough estimate.
