doctors, and representatives of sanitary and epidemiological services
visited 23 954 homes of farmers and inoculated 8977 people.

Ukraine bird flu outbreak spreads
---------------------------------
Ukraine's bird flu outbreak appeared to have escalated Monday [12 Dec
2005], as health officials reported new cases of domestic foul found dead
in 2 cities and 19 villages on the Crimean peninsula.
The bird flu virus had been confirmed only in 9 of the villages, said Irina
Shakhno, spokeswoman for the Emergency Situations Ministry's Crimean
office. The Health Ministry said that reports were coming in about domestic
birds found dead in 10 other villages, the regional capital, Simferopol,
and another city, Feodosia. It was not immediately clear how many birds had
died.
The Agriculture Ministry's Veterinary Department reported that birds had
been found dead in unusually high numbers in 17 locations as of Sunday [11
Dec 2005], but did not explain the discrepancy between its figures and
those of the Health Ministry.
A special laboratory was set up in Simferopol to test the new samples. If
tests confirm the animals died of bird flu, it would mean a spread of the
virus through Crimea beyond the marshlands near the Sea of Azov.
Ukraine announced its 1st case of bird flu on 4 Dec 2005, revealing that
some 2500 domestic fowl had died suddenly in a marsh area on the Black Sea
peninsula. Some 37 405 domestic fowl have been slaughtered as part of a
mandatory cull. Meanwhile, World Health Organization experts have arrived
to examine the situation and to assist in efforts to stop the infection's
spread, the Health Ministry said. On Friday [9 Dec 2005], a Russian
laboratory said it had confirmed the virus was the same strain that
decimated flocks in Asia, but Ukrainian officials said they were waiting
for findings from a British laboratory.

Romania finds bird flu cases outside Danube delta
-------------------------------------------------
Romania has found new cases of avian flu in fowl in a region west of the
Danube delta, where the deadly strain of the virus was 1st isolated in
October 2005, officials said on Monday [12 Dec 2005]. Bird flu has been
found in birds in 14 villages in and around the Danube delta, Europe's
largest wetlands, which lie on a major migratory route for wild birds. 4
outbreaks have been confirmed as the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, the
most recent showing that the virus appears to be edging west towards more
populated areas.
H5N1 is endemic in poultry in parts of Asia, where it has killed 70 people.
"We detected the H5 type in several hens and turkeys from a small Gypsy
(Roma) community, one km from the village of Braesti (in the county of
Buzau)," director of the Animal Health and Diagnosis Institute Nicolae
Stefan told Reuters. Braesti is about 130 km (80 miles) west of the Danube
delta and about 150 km north east of the capital Bucharest.
"The H5 type of virus was also confirmed in the village of Padina," Stefan
added. On Sunday [11 Dec 2005], the official said 5 new suspected cases of
avian flu in domestic birds had been discovered in Padina in the same
county of Buzau.
The official said that samples from birds would be sent to a laboratory in
Britain to see whether it was H5N1. He also said authorities culled all the
birds from the small Roma community as a precautionary move against the
disease. Romania has no capabilities to test for H5N1.
Also on Monday [12 Dec 2005], the country's chief veterinarian Ion Agafitei
told Reuters that veterinarians discovered 3 suspected bird flu cases in
hens in the village of Tataru, in the Braila county, which borders the delta.
H5N1 remains hard for people to catch, but there are fears it could mutate
into a form which passes easily from person to person, sparking a pandemic
in which millions could die. There have been no cases of human infection
outside of Asia.
