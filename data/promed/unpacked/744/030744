A new strain of foot-and-mouth disease may have contaminated livestock in
Iloilo, [Philippines. "This case is still under investigation and we have
already sent experts to verify it," said Dr. Peter Sobrevega, Department of
Agriculture (DA) chief for animal disease diagnostic laboratory.
The FMD death toll climbed to 357 from last week's 84 and the number of
infected swine has increased to 1124, with 8 new cases recorded in Zarraga
town.
The reported FMD-infected carabao was found in San Enrique town, which is
adjacent to Passi City where the first FMD case was reported on Sept. 6.
"There is a possibility that this is a new strain, although there were rare
cases in the past of infection (of) carabaos and cattle in Luzon by the
type-O FMD," Sobrevega said. What usually affects carabaos and cattle are
the "A" and "C" types of FMD, according to a primer by the DA Livestock
Division and the Bureau of Animal Industry.
The strain that affected swine in Iloilo was the "O" type, the same strain
that hit Luzon last year, Sobrevega said.
The FMD plague in Iloilo prompted local officials in other Western Visayas
provinces to install mechanisms to prevent its spread.
In Aklan, Gov. Florencio Miraflores ordered the setting up of checkpoints
at all points of entry and exit in the province to bar the entry of
livestock from Iloilo. All bus companies that ply the Aklan-Iloilo route
were also warned against bringing in swine and meat products from Iloilo or
face sanctions.
Negros officials also tightened the watch against the entry of livestock
from Iloilo after 5 hogs from Banate, Iloilo were found to have been
shipped to E. B. Magalona, Negros Occidental despite the ban.
