Date submitted to OIE: 21 May 2013
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Low pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H7N9
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic), laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1: Fuli market, Licheng, Zengcheng, Guangdong
Date of start of the outbreak: 20 May 2013
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / - / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: one sample from a chicken

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / - / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: gene sequencing shows that it is low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAI). The intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) is 0.

Control measures
Measures applied: control of wildlife reservoirs, quarantine, movement control inside the country, screening, zoning, disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s), dipping/spraying, no vaccination, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: stamping out

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Harbin veterinary research institute, Chinese academy of agricultural sciences (OIE's Reference Laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Birds / intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) test / 27 Apr 2013 / Negative *
Birds / gene sequencing / 20 May 2013 / Positive
Birds / haemagglutination inhibition test (HIT) / 20 May 2013 / Positive
Birds / intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) test / 20 May 2013 / Negative
Birds / pathogen isolation by egg inoculation / 20 May 2013 / Positive
Birds / reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 20 May 2013 / Positive
* [Since this test, apparently applied prior to the reported start of the outbreak, is mentioned again on 20 May 2013, it is not clear if it is related to the same sample/event; clarification would be helpful. - Mod.AS]

[A HealthMap/proMED-mail interactive map of China can be seen at http://healthmap.org/r/1zaU and the location of the outbreak on the map included in the OIE report at the source URL above. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ

According to a report published by the Shaanxi News Network on 15 May 2013 and included in ProMED-mail posting 20130516.1718130, the sample mentioned in the OIE report above had been collected on 15 May 2013 (or earlier) from a chicken in the Fuli market, Licheng, Zengcheng City, Guangdong, initially tested by a provincial laboratory, and found infected by an H7 avian influenza virus. Subsequently it was submitted for confirmation to China's National reference laboratory where it was eventually confirmed as LPAI (IVPI = 0), A/H7N9 virus.

The initial relevant media report, published on 15 May 2013, provided the following additional information:
"The Guangzhou City Agricultural Division collected poultry samples from a poultry sales stall in Fuli market, Licheng, Zengcheng City. In one chicken, infection with avian influenza serotype H7 was demonstrated in the Guangdong provincial laboratory. No further typing of the virus has been accomplished; the sample has been submitted to a reference laboratory for confirmation and complete serotyping. The stall owner has shown no disease signs nor been found positive yet.

"Subsequent to the laboratory results, the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Agriculture launched the following emergency response measures:
- closure of the Licheng-Fuli market;
- culling and disposal of more than 9500 birds in the market;
- thorough disinfection of the market;
- a 7-day period of health monitoring of the persons engaged in sale stalls of the market".

"The Zengcheng City Government said that the origin of the positive chicken has been verified and may be announced on 16 May 2013".

ProMED-mail is not aware of a published verification on the origin of the positive chicken. Such information, if available, would be appreciated.

So far, 2 H7N9 infected chickens have been reported on 2 different open markets in Guangdong, where mass cullings were, reportedly, performed. No human infections are known to have been reported in Guangdong so far.

As indicated in ProMED-mail posting 20130517.1719324, the Guangzhou health authorities temporarily suspended exports of live poultry and other products -- "including frozen poultry and eggs" -- to Hong Kong. ProMED-mail asked for a confirmation of the term "frozen"; we have subsequently been referred to Hong Kong's official site http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201305/16/P201305160715.htm, which mentions the "export of live poultry and poultry products (including chilled and frozen poultry)". - Mod.AS]

[An explanation of
"Control measures
Measures applied: control of wildlife reservoirs"
would also be apopreciated. - Mod.JW]

Could rats, mice, and other rodents be biological carriers of the A/H7N9 virus?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The livestock markets across the Asian continent countries, that by their nature constitute a tourist attraction, are so to speak, a true "Noah's Ark"; there are ducks, geese, quail, turkeys, chickens, roosters, pigeons, pheasants, parrots, exotic birds, among others for sale, and in addition, dogs, cats, rabbits, monkeys, and another wild and domestic animals.

Specific to birds, and following a buyer's request, ducks, geese, turkeys, quail, and chickens are sacrificed [on the spot].

Tourists can also purchase a series of products especially handcrafted with untreated feathers of wild birds: earrings, necklaces, rings, bracelets, boas, pins, and collars.

This setting presents an imminent danger for poultry farmers who visit those sites and return to their countries of origin without any biosecurity measures and consequently to their poultry farms, thus expanding this dangerous virus.

In these markets there are thousands of rats and mice which circulate freely during the night among all these animals, their excrements, and also consume their corpses.

Since up to this date there's still no clarity on the origin of the new A/H7N9 virus, and given the environment previously described, I would like to bring to your attention the following concern:

Could rats and mice be the biological carriers of some subtypes of avian influenza viruses and that perhaps there, if specific research is carried out, find the source of the current outbreak in China?

[Without going into discussion on the respective potential role of the above-mentioned species in the epidemiology of A/H7N9, it seems plausible to conclude already at this stage, that the closing down and other restrictive measures applied in the open animal markets in Eastern China may have significantly contributed to controlling further spread of the agent. - Mod.AS
