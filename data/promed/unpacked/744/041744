A northeastern Ohio man has been sentenced to 6 years in federal prison after being convicted of having ricin and lying to FBI agents when he denied making the deadly toxin. Prosecutors say the individual of Akron was planning to use the ricin to harm his stepfather and emergency responders in an elaborate suicide attempt. A federal judge in Cleveland sentenced the 58-year-old man on Monday [29 Sep 2014]. He had faced a maximum of life prison.

His attorney says the man never threatened or tried to hurt anyone with the ricin. [The sentence above says he was planning harm to his stepfather, emergency responders, and himself. That certainly sounds like harm. - Mod.TG] Prosecutors say the man produced ricin at his home and kept it in a freezer until FBI agents recovered it in January 2011. They say he was going to set a house fire and use the ricin against emergency responders. [Again, this sounds like he was planning to harm someone, other than himself. - Mod.TG]

[Ricin is one of the most toxic biological agents known -- a Category B bioterrorism agent and a Schedule number 1 chemical warfare agent, which is why ProMED is posting this even though it caused no illness or death in this case. - Mod.JW

Why is ricin the "desirable poison" lately? One might suggest because the US television show "Breaking Bad" featured some episodes of making and using ricin. Is this an attempt of followers of the show to imitate what they have seen?

Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans. If castor beans are chewed and swallowed, the released ricin can cause injury. Ricin can be made from the waste material left over from processing castor beans. It is a potent protein derived from the beans of the castor plant (_Ricinus communis_). Castor beans are used in the production of castor oil, a brake and hydraulic fluid constituent. The aqueous phase of the process, termed the "waste mash," is 5-10 percent ricin. Ricin works by getting inside the cells of a person's body and preventing the cells from making the proteins they need, hence, it is often called a toxalbumin. Without the proteins, cells die. Eventually this is harmful to the whole body, and death may occur.

Castor oil does not contain ricin.

Ricin can be in the form of a powder, a mist, or a pellet, or it can be dissolved in water or weak acid. It is a stable substance under normal conditions, but can be inactivated by heat above 80 deg C (176 deg F).

Ricin has been used experimentally in medicine to kill cancer cells.

Effects of ricin poisoning depend on whether ricin was inhaled, ingested, or injected. The major symptoms of ricin poisoning depend on the route of exposure and the dose received, though many organs may be affected in severe cases. Initial symptoms of ricin poisoning by inhalation may occur within 8 hours of exposure. Following ingestion of ricin, initial symptoms typically occur in less than 6 hours.

Inhalation: within a few hours of inhaling significant amounts of ricin, the likely symptoms would be respiratory distress (difficulty breathing), fever, cough, nausea, and tightness in the chest. Heavy sweating may follow as well as fluid is building up in the lungs (pulmonary edema). This would make breathing even more difficult, and the skin might turn blue. Excess fluid in the lungs would be diagnosed by x-ray or by listening to the chest with a stethoscope. Finally, low blood pressure and respiratory failure may occur, leading to death. In cases of known exposure to ricin, people having respiratory symptoms that started within 12 hours of inhaling ricin should seek medical care.

Ingestion: if someone swallows a significant amount of ricin, he or she would develop vomiting and diarrhea that may become bloody. Severe dehydration may be the result, followed by low blood pressure. Other signs or symptoms may include hallucinations, seizures, and blood in the urine. Within several days, the person's liver, spleen, and kidneys might stop working, and the person could die.

Skin and eye exposure: ricin is unlikely to be absorbed through normal skin. Contact with ricin powders or products may cause redness and pain of the skin and the eyes.

Death from ricin poisoning could take place within 36 to 72 hours of exposure, depending on the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or injection) and the dose received.

If in suspected situations where ricin may have been disseminated, preliminary environmental testing by public health or law enforcement authorities may detect ricin in powders or materials released into the immediate environment. Persons occupying such areas may initially be observed for signs of ricin poisoning.

No widely available, reliable medical test exists to confirm that a person has been exposed to ricin.

Because no antidote exists for ricin, the most important factor is avoiding ricin exposure in the 1st place. If exposure cannot be avoided, the most important factor is then getting the ricin off or out of the body as quickly as possible.

Symptomatic ricin poisoning is treated by giving victims supportive medical care to minimize the effects of the poisoning. The types of supportive medical care would depend on several factors, such as the route by which victims were poisoned (that is, whether poisoning was by inhalation, ingestion, or skin or eye exposure). Care could include such measures as helping victims breathe, giving them intravenous fluids, giving them medications to treat conditions such as seizures and low blood pressure, flushing their stomachs with activated charcoal (if the ricin has been very recently ingested), or washing out their eyes with water if their eyes are irritated.
