[African swine fever (ASF) is an infectious disease of domestic and wild pigs of all breeds and ages, caused by a virus that produces a range of syndromes. Acute disease is characterised by high fever, haemorrhages in the reticuloendothelial system, and a high mortality rate. Soft ticks of the _Ornithodoros_ genus, especially _O. moubata_ and _O. erraticus_, have been shown to be both reservoirs and transmission vectors of ASF virus (ASFV) (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.01_ASF.pdf).

African swine fever is enzootic in most countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, including Madagascar. In Europe, it has been reported and successfully eradicated from the Iberian Peninsula but continues to be found in Sardinia. In the 1970s, ASFV was present in the Caribbean (Haiti and the Dominican Republic) and one country in South America (Brazil), but was successfully eradicated. Most recently, it has appeared in the Caucasus (Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia) and Russia (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/AFRICAN_SWINE_FEVER_FINAL.pdf).

There is no published treatment or vaccine for ASF. In endemic areas, it is difficult to eliminate the natural reservoir in warthogs; however, control of the soft tick vectors is important in preventing the disease. It is also important to ensure that meat from warthogs or infected animals is not fed to susceptible pigs. All successful eradication programs have involved the rapid diagnosis, slaughter and disposal of all animals on infected premises, thorough cleaning and disinfection, deinsectisation, movement controls and surveillance. ASF is not a human health threat (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/ASF-EN.pdf).

Pictures of ASF are available at http://www.fao.org/eims/secretariat/empres/eims_search/simple_s_result.asp?photo=3&disease=88.

Parakou is the largest city in eastern Benin, and capital of the Borgou Department. Borgou is one of the 12 departments of Benin. Borgou borders the country of Nigeria and the departments of Alibori, Atakora, Collines and Donga (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borgou_Department).

Although the disease has been reported as absent from the Department of Borgou since September 2005, it has been reported in other Departments of the country. Quantitative information provided by OIE's WAHID database shows that from January 2005 to June 2013, Benin reported 152 outbreaks of ASF in several of its departments.
