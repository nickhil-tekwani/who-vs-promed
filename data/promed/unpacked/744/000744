Mexico's Secretary of Health, Jose Angel Cordova, said that the
recent outbreak of Guillain-Barre syndrome is now under control,
while the causes are being investigated.

He explained that a thorough study of the cases affected with this
disease [GBS] included bacteriological and heavy metal sampling,
because this disease usually causes an ascending paralysis, and in
the detected cases, it [paralysis] was widespread. When questioned by
journalists about the possible causes of the outbreak reported in
Veracruz, the Secretary of Health said it could be caused by heavy
metal poisoning based on some of the clinical features presenting
with this paralysis, and hence the studies are being conducted in this field.

Similarly, they have ruled out the possibility of a direct
relationship between the influenza vaccine and the reported
Guillain-Barre cases in the coastal state.

Fortunately, he said, for the past 10 days, there have not been
reports of new cases of this disease, which presents as a flaccid
paralysis, beginning in the extremities, with involvement of the
spinal cord due to the effects of the loss of the myelin sheaths
covering the nerves.

[Apparently, this event was caused by exposure to an environmental
agent or an outbreak of food poisoning. The short period speaks in
favor of a single, short-lived exposure. - Mod.LJS]

[More information on this investigation from reliable sources would
be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
