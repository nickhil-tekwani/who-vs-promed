Epidemiological comments: The animals had been sampled after observation of a drop in egg production and eggs lacking a complete shell. Samples of 20 laying hens were sent to the National Reference Center for Poultry and Rabbit Diseases (NRGK, Zurich, Switzerland), where 15 animals tested positive for NCD serologically in the ELISA and 2 tested positive in PCR on 21 Jan 2022. New samples have been taken for further typification of the virus at the Institute of Virology and lmmunology (IVI, Mittelhausern, Switzerland). So far, presence of viral RNA could be detected in 50 out of 60 samples. At the moment, the source of introduction into the holding is unknown. The establishment has been put under movement restriction, and protection and surveillance zones have been established. The 10 km [6.2 mi] surveillance zone reaches the border to Germany and the district of Waldshut. The German authorities have been informed accordingly.

[A press release published on 22 Jan 2022 by the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO) mentioned that "on 22 Jan 2022, in a poultry farm in Niederglatt, the veterinary authorities have detected the highly contagious Newcastle disease in several laying hens. In order to prevent the spread of the animal disease, the poultry population concerned must be culled. The Canton of Zurich is setting up a protection and surveillance zone around the farm, in which special regulations apply to poultry farms."

"To prevent the highly contagious virus from spreading further, the affected company was closed. Only persons who care for the animals and the veterinary authorities have access to the stables. The Zurich Veterinary Office is establishing a protection zone of 3 km [1.9 mi] and a surveillance zone of 10 km [6.1 mi] around the herd. Specific rules apply to poultry holdings in these zones. The last case of Newcastle disease in Switzerland occurred in November 2017 in the canton of Ticino."
