Conventional wisdom is that infants born between five days before and
two days after a mother comes out in a varicella rash are at risk of
severe varicella, because they have been exposed in-utero without
having remained there long enough to benefit from the emerging
maternal immune response. Whether maternal immunoglobulin has anything
to do with it is not clear to me given the short time frame and
the fact that IgM traditionally does not cross the placenta.
I would interpret the appearance of the baby's rash at that point as
being indicative of transplacental spread of VZV [varicella-zoster
virus] during the initial low level viraemic phase which occurs
at about three days after initial infection (it is this low level wave
that you are trying to block with the neutralising antibody in
V-ZIG [varicella-zoster immune globulin] when you give it to exposed at risk
individuals). Spread at this stage would seem to be a little unusual,
but by no means inconceivable. If this is so, then the baby may
well have been exposed to VZV for long enough to benefit from whatever
specific or non specific responses might have been transferred
trans-placentally, but perhaps more importantly, might have also been
able to mount a response itself.
These postulates notwithstanding, I would have a very low threshold
for starting this infant on intravenous acyclovir, and would have expect
V-ZIG to have little if any effect on the clinical course of the
illness.
Two references from a quick search are appended, but the chapter on
VZV infection in Remington and Klein, "Infectious Diseases of the
Fetus and Newborn Infant" is likely to give you all the info you need
and all the key references.

Outcome in newborn babies given anti-varicella-zoster immunoglobulin after
perinatal maternal infection with varicella-zoster virus.
Miller E; Cradock-Watson JE; Ridehalgh MK
Lancet (ENGLAND) Aug 12 1989 2 (8659) p371-3 ISSN: 0140-6736
281 newborn babies whose mothers had chickenpox and 25 whose mothers had
herpes zoster during the perinatal period were investigated. IgG antibody was
present at birth in all babies born more than 7 days after the onset of
maternal chickenpox. When the mother's rash appeared 7-3 days before delivery
progressively fewer babies were born with antibody, and no infant born less
than 3 days after the onset had antibody at birth. Infants were given 100 or
250 mg of anti-varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) shortly after birth or
the onset of post-natal maternal chickenpox. 1 infant died, without neonatal
varicella. Of the 280 surviving infants 169 (60%) were infected--134 (48%)
with chickenpox and 35 (13%) without clinical features. The clinical attack
rate was highest (60%) in infants whose mothers had chickenpox between 7 days
before and 7 days after delivery. Chickenpox was severe in 19 infants, 16 of
whom were exposed to maternal chickenpox between 4 days before and 2 days after
delivery. There was no evidence that a severe outcome was associated with
transplacentally acquired infection. Perinatal maternal herpes zoster did not
cause neonatal infection. VZIG should be given to infants at risk, including
those whose mothers have chickenpox during the last 7 days of pregnancy.

Varicella-zoster virus infections in pregnancy [see comments]
Fox GN; Strangarity JW
Am Fam Physician (UNITED STATES) Feb 1989 39 (2) p89-98 ISSN: 0002-838X
Note: Comment in: Am Fam Physician 1989 Aug;40(2):55
Varicella-zoster virus can cause a distinct congenital syndrome, a
potentially fatal neonatal infection and life-threatening maternal illness.
Physicians can reduce morbidity from these conditions by advising nonimmune
pregnant women to avoid exposure to chickenpox and herpes zoster and, when
indicated, by promptly administering varicella-zoster immune globulin. When
prevention fails, acyclovir may be effective therapy. (24 References)

Neonatal varicella may be biphasic. Infants may have a few lesions, show
improvement for several days, then develop a generalized rash. Some
newborns may develop prolonged varicella with new lesions occurring into the
second week of life. Possible complications of neonatal varicella include
bacterial superinfection, and pneumonia. About 30% of newborns born to
mothers who develop varicella 5 days before, or 2 days after delivery will
die of neonatal varicella. Death typically occurs from pneumonia or
disseminated visceral involvement. VZIG [varicella-zoster immune
globulin] administration can decrease morbidity and mortality.
The continued temperature instability of this child is concerning,
and may signify ongoing viral or bacterial infection.
Close observation is warranted. Depending on the clinical
course, intravenous acyclovir may be indicated.
