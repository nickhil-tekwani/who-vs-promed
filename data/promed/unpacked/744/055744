'Mystery' disease kills 20 children
------------------------------------------------
At least 20 children have died of a mysterious disease in Masongaleni
Location in Kibwezi Division in the past week.

The Makueni District Medical Officer of Health, Dr Joseph Mwangi and his
deputy Joseph Matheka, said the children were aged between five and 10 years.

Confirming the deaths yesterday, the officers said they suspected the
disease, which broke out last Thursday, could be Hepatitis B.

They said the symptoms include extended stomach, fever and jaundice of the
eyes.

Matheka said samples of maize, beans and the flour taken to the Government
Chemist in Nairobi indicated the children might have eaten contaminated food.

Mwangi said isolated cases of the disease had been reported in the
neighbouring Makindu Division, with unconfirmed reports indicating a
similar outbreak in Kitui District.

Local leaders led by the area's MP Kalembe Ndile appealed to the Government
to send more medical personnel to the area to check the spread of the disease.

The MP, however, commended the district and provincial medical personnel
for their quick response when the outbreak was reported.

The district health boss warned the locals against using traditional herbs,
saying this was complicating the situation.

[The Makueni District is located in the southeast part of the country
approximately 120 miles southeast of Nairobi and one district away from the
border with Tanzania. On the list of febrile jaundice infectious illnesses that
might cluster in Kenya include the hepatidities (hepatitis A,B,C and D),
leptospirosis, yellow fever, relapsing fever, malaria and hemorrhagic fevers
such as ebola and CCHF. Hemorrhagic manifestations are not mentioned in the
above article, and it would be unusual to cluster in the 5-10 year old age
group, hence they are less likely diagnoses. The newswire speculates hepatitis
B from possible contaminated food sources, but foodborne transmission of HBV
has not been described in outbreak settings. The significant mortality would
not usually be seen with an HBV outbreak unless there is co-infection with the
hepatitis D (Delta) virus. Another possibility is an acute hepatic toxin
exposure, which may explain the concerns about the food. Rather than continue
to speculate (which can be a fun exercise) it seems prudent at this point to
request further information from authoritative sources. - Mod.MPP]
