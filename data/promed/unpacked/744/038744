I am wondering to what extent countries like Viet Nam have been
linking their FMD vaccination program activities with other animal
vaccination activities, such as, HPAI.

Developing countries face inevitable logistics costs and a nightmare
when attempting to implement effective animal (small-holder and
subsistence livestock) vaccination strategies in the field, so it
would be nice to think that when resources are made available to
enable vaccination for one major scourge like HPAI, they are also made
available and actively coordinated with complementary resources to
facilitate vaccination against other major diseases (FMD, CSF, PRRS in
its highly virulent form spring to mind in Viet Nam's case). Hopefully
that has been the case (could well be) because there is little doubt
in my mind that surveillance and rapid response capacities have
improved considerably in Viet Nam (and the whole Mekong sub-system)
during recent years.

[Vaccinations in poultry (such as, HPAI) are generally applied
independently of vaccinations in mammal species, for various reasons.
Viet Nam's annual report to the OIE does not mention mass vaccination
against FMD. The figures given relate to "ring vaccinations": for
2008, a total of 9042 in cattle and 5080 in buffaloes, out of national
populations of nearly 6.5 million cattle and about 2.9 million
buffaloes.

Complementary information from the MBDS region, particularly in
relation to the FMD vaccination policy in 2009, will be useful. -
