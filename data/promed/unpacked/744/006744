A second round of polio vaccinations in Ethiopia will be conducted for
three days, beginning Friday, following the first round a month ago in
which six million children under the age of five were vaccinated. A total
of 8.5 million children were targeted to be immunized in the two rounds of
the country's national immunization campaign. The first round was held
from Nov. 13-16 throughout the country, which health officials said was a
success in that 70 percent of the target was attained.
Makonnen Admassu, an expert in family health care in the Ministry of
Health, said last week that despite transport problems encountered in parts
of the country affected by floods in November, he was confident the total
target would be met at the end of the second round of the campaign.
Ethiopia had made four months of preparation for the two-round immunization
campaign involving 75,000 health workers and volunteers and 25,000
immunization centres at a total cost of 4.6 million U.S. dollars. Most of
this sum was provided by the global partners for eradicating polio
worldwide by the year 2000 -- Rotary International, WHO, UNICEF and the
United States government through its agency for International Development
(USAID) and the Atlanta-based Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Ethiopia, with the second highest incidence of polio in Africa after
Nigeria, has an estimated 2,000 cases. This accounts for 17 percent of the
estimated 12,000 cases each year in Africa, and 3 percent of the 60,000
cases yearly in the world, according to WHO.
