The French Agriculture Ministry on Sunday reported a new case of mad cow
disease, the tenth infected animal found in France this year. Officials
discovered the ailing milk cow late last week in Nehou in the region of
Normandy. The other 88 animals in its herd were being slaughtered as a
precaution.
In 1999, authorities discovered 31 cases of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy in France.
The ministry has said new cases of BSE will appear in France until 2001,
five years after authorities took stringent measures to prevent outbreaks.
The disease has an average incubation period of five years.
Officials on Saturday said they will begin tests of ailing and dead cattle
to determine how widespread the disease has become. The screening is due to
start in late April or early May.
France has provoked a spat within the European Union by keeping in place
its ban on beef from Britain, despite the EU's August ruling that declared
British beef once again safe for import. After the German parliament lifted
a four-year-old ban on the meat on Friday, France is now the only European
country that continues to ban British beef.

[It should be noted that diseases have variable incubation periods, usually
skewed to the right of the mean, or in simpler terms one should expect
longer incubation periods than that described by the simple average. And
like everyone else, France has had problems ensuring that livestock are not
fed prohibited materials. - MHJ
