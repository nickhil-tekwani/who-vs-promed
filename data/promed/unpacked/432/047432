Angola: international charity seeks closure of hospital
-----------------------------------------------
On 9 Apr 2005, an international medical charity battling the hemorrhagic
fever that so far has killed 181 Angolans has urged the government to close
the regional hospital here, at the center of the outbreak, saying the
medical center itself is a source of the deadly infection. Medicins sans
Frontieres (MSF), the global relief organization that runs an isolation
ward at the hospital for victims of the deadly Marburg hemorrhagic fever,
told Angolan officials on Friday [8 Apr 2005] that the hospital should be
closed if the rapidly spreading epidemic was to be contained. 2 other
hospitals within 60 miles of Uige may also have to be shut down, said
Monica de Castellarnau, the organization's emergency coordinator in Uige,
the provincial capital where the outbreak was 1st reported.
That possibility raises the prospect of a 2nd health care crisis, one in
which hundreds of thousands of people already facing a disease that is
almost always fatal may suddenly have no access to hospital care. But in an
interview in the streets of Uige, where an intensive effort is under way to
find and isolate new cases of the virus, Ms. Castellarnau said there might
be no alternative. "The hospital has been the main source of infection,"
she said. "We have to break that chain somehow. It is a massive public
health decision, and it must be taken by the government." Angola's outbreak
of Marburg virus, the largest ever recorded, continues to spread. The
disease, which causes a high fever, diarrhea, vomiting and bleeding from
bodily orifices, has no effective treatment. 9 out of every 10 victims here
have died, usually within a week of falling ill.
Uige, a town of roughly 200 000 set in the idyllic green hills of northern
Angola, has become a surreal backdrop to a public-health disaster, as
medical workers swathed head-to-toe in space suit-style garb roam
neighborhoods in trucks trying to round up the sick. Because Marburg virus
is so dangerous and so contagious, spread by contact with almost any bodily
fluid, from blood to sweat, the workers are encapsulated in air-filled
white suits, white aprons, green gloves, face masks and face guards. On
their backs, they wear battery packs to keep the suits inflated. Some carry
canisters of bleach or chlorine on their backs and hose sprays so they can
disinfect the homes of the sick. A few have sprayed so much bleach that the
buckles on their shoes are rusting.
Medical workers warn visitors not to shake hands with anyone and not to
stand directly in front of residents when talking to them, for fear that a
cough could release an infectious spray of spittle. Silo Margarita is one
of the few nurses still working at the 500-bed regional hospital here, a
sprawling collection of well-kept, one-story concrete buildings that
appeared almost deserted on Saturday [9 Apr 2005] afternoon. Wearing a
surgical mask and plastic wrapped on her boots, she continued to care for
12 patients, despite the fact, she said, that as many as 15 of the
hospital's nurses and 2 doctors have died from Marburg virus infection. 2
nurses died only last Thursday [7 Apr 2005], she said.
Medical workers here are scrambling to persuade a terrified public to alert
them to sick relatives so that patients can be isolated in a ward before
still more people become infected. Suspected cases have already been
identified in 7 of Angola's provinces. In the capital, Luanda, 2 cases have
been confirmed and one is suspected.
On Saturday [9 Apr 2005], medical workers seeking to build cooperation in
one neighborhood here faced angry residents, even though they were
accompanied by government officials and police officers. Officials have
ruled out surveillance efforts in that neighborhood, saying it has become
too dangerous. Often in epidemics of such lethal diseases, medical workers
become the focus of the public's fear, frustration and anger, according to
officials of the World Health Organization, which is organizing the
emergency response to the outbreak. Dr. Heinz Feldmann, a Canadian with the
World Health Organization who has set up a laboratory at the hospital to
test for the virus, said he could check as many as a 100 samples a day. But
because the medical teams were forced on Thursday [7 Apr 2005] to suspend
their community searches for new cases, he said he was now getting only 4
samples a day.

Angola: Marburg hemorrhagic fever death toll now 184
-----------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that the death toll from
the epidemic of Marburg hemorrhagic fever has jumped to 184 from a total of
213 cases recorded in Angola until Saturday 9 Apr 2005. In a statement
published here on Sun 10 Apr 2005, WHO said that all the reported cases of
Marburg fever had originated in the northwestern province of Uige, though
patients have died elsewhere, including in Luanda, Zaire, Malange, Kuangza
Norte, Kuanza South and Cabinda provinces, according to the statement.
WHO's deputy director-general, Anarfi Asamoa-Baah, issued an alert in
Luanda for neighboring countries to adopt emergency precautions to avoid
the spread of the epidemic that 1st broke out in Uige in October 2004. The
United Nations' aid coordination body, OCHA, also launched an international
appeal for a fund of USD 3.5 million to help contain the Marburg outbreak.
The World Health Organization, the United States Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, and Medecins sans Frontieres have deployed teams in
Uige to combat the virus. The worst previously recorded outbreak of the
virus killed 123 people in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo
between 1998 and 2000, the last known outbreak of Marburg virus.

Angola: attacks briefly halt WHO campaign
---------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) teams fighting an outbreak of Marburg
virus in Angola were forced to temporarily suspend work in one area after
scared residents stoned their vehicles, officials said on Saturday [9 Apr
2005]. WHO halted operations in parts of the Uige district in northwestern
Angola on Friday, following the attacks on Thursday [7 Apr 2005]. Residents
apparently feared the medics could be spreading the infection that has
already claimed 184 lives, some of them health workers.
WHO said later on Saturday [9 Apr 2005] that it had restarted the campaign
in Uige, the epicenter of the outbreak. Angola's Health Department,
releasing the latest death toll figures, said there had been a total of 213
cases, making it the worst outbreak of the disease yet.
"Of course it has restarted," Fatomata Diallo, WHO's country
representative, said when asked whether WHO had since resumed its
operations. "In this kind of outbreak control, security is crucial. If we
find those kind of problems in all parts of Uige, we will stop (our
operation). But it was only in one part of Uige that we found this
problem," she said. Diallo said WHO had been in touch with local officials
and had received more support to help continue with its work.
WHO vehicles carrying 18 staff were attacked and damaged in Uige on
Thursday [7 Apr 2005], the WHO said on its Web site. "We are very
concerned, because you can begin counting every day lost in terms of how
many people die. It's important to get this job done. Every day it is
delayed is a problem," Richard Thompson, WHO's spokesman on communicable
diseases, told Reuters. "This kind of reaction from local people is not
uncommon in a hemorrhagic fever outbreak," he said. "They (locals)
sometimes believe that it is the medicine people who have brought the
illness to their communities." The medics were following leads that up to
200 people could have come in contact with infected people, Thompson said.
So far, 14 health workers have died of the disease, he said. Uige residents
needed to be better informed about the work of the surveillance teams who
have been collecting dead bodies and educating the public about the virus,
another WHO official said. The WHO has advised residents not to touch those
infected with the virus or handle the bodies.
