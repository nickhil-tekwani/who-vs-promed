This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1: Maipo [Santiago Metropolitan Region]
Date of start of the outbreak: 3 Sep 2013
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Swine / 8229 / 2554 / 1651 / 0 / 0 /
Affected population: Swine: breeding females and their offspring. Main clinical signs in females: cough, fever, loss of appetite, blue ears, vulvar edema, abortions, premature births, increase of the number of mummified fetuses and birth of weak offspring; in piglets: respiratory distress and diarrhea.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Total animals affected:

*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and /or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: the outbreak is limited to a compartment which corresponds to the population in a single commercial farm. Until the date of this report, there is no evidence of other outbreaks.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: screening

Diagnostic test results

[*****There is no evidence of human infection with PRRS virus.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is characterized by reproductive failure of sows and respiratory problems of piglets and growing pigs. The disease is caused by the PRRS virus, a virus currently classified as a member of the order _Nidovirales_, family _Arteriviridae_, genus _Arterivirus_. The primary target cell of the virus is the alveolar macrophage of the pig. 2 major antigenic types of the virus exist, the type 1 (European) and the type 2 (American). The virus is primarily transmitted via infected pigs but also by faeces, urine, semen, and fomites.

PRRS occurs in most major pig-producing areas throughout the world. The reproductive failure is characterised by infertility, late fetal mummification, abortions, stillbirths, and the birth of weak piglets that often die soon after birth from respiratory disease and secondary infections. Older pigs may demonstrate mild signs of respiratory disease, usually complicated by secondary infections. No other species are known to be naturally infected with PRRSV.

For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2013, Chapter 2.8. 7 "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.07_PRRS.pdf (Adopted by the OIE World Assembly of Delegates, May 2010).

According to the most recent 6-monthly OIE report (July-December 2012 or January-June 2013), available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist, PRRS was reported as present in 21 countries, infection present (with no clinical disease) in 9 countries, limited to certain zones in 2 countries, as suspect in 1 country, never reported in 63 countries, and absent during this period in 38 countries. Most countries have no specified surveillance for PRRS, some maintain "general surveillance" and very few maintain "targeted surveillance".

Quantitative information provided by OIE's WAHID database shows that during 2012 the following countries in the region of the Americas reported outbreaks of PRRS: Bolivia (2), Colombia (53), Guatemala (2), Mexico (1181), and Panama (8).

The disease is also present in Canada, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, and Unites States of America but no quantitative data is available (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail).

Prior to their most recent report, Chile reported 2 outbreaks of PRRS in 2005 and 1 outbreak in 2006. These events were located in the Los Lagos region (1) and in the Santiago Metropolitan Region (2).
This information and additional data on these outbreaks can be found in the WAHID database at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail (Note: to view the information on PRRS scroll down to the name of the disease, choose the region or country and time period).

PRRS can have high fatality rates (for this event the fatality rate was almost 65 percent). This presents significant economic loss to swine producers, particularly when the average fatality rate is approximately 20 percent (and up to 100 percent in single production units) for the newly emergent virulent strains (http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/al849e/al849e00.pdf).

Chile has directives (http://www.sag.cl/sites/default/files/D_235_2001_PRRS.pdf, and http://www.sag.cl/sites/default/files/D_191_2000_DECLARA_IC_PRRS.pdf), quarantine procedures http://www.sag.cl/sites/default/files/PROCEDIM_CUARENTENA_PREDIAL_PRRS.pdf,
and herd health measures in place to eradicate PRRS. The control measures are applied along the production continuum from farm to slaughter, with free herd status being granted by the official animal health authorities (http://www.sag.cl/sites/default/files/PROCEDIM_SANEAMIENTO_PREDIAL_ERRADICAC_PRRS.pdf). - Mod.CRD
