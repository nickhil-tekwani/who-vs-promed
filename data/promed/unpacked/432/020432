Replica football shirts, withdrawn from sale in Germany following
allegations they were poisoned, are made in Britain. ["Replica" presumably
here means copies of shirts of famous teams on sale to the general public -
Mod.JW].
Nike's world headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, pledged a quick probe to
determine whether any of its products -- including Glasgow Rangers shirts --
are laced with a toxic anti-bacterial chemical used in the Unites States
textile industry.
"We're doing independent tests on our end to ensure there is no risk to the
public," spokesman Vada Manager said. He said it appears the shirts were
made in Britain. Arsenal and Glasgow Rangers are among the teams that wear
Nike. German department stores have already pulled Borussia Dortmund shirts
off their shelves.
The action followed a German television report that the replica shirts
contained tributyltin (TBT), a heavy metal compound used in paint for ships.
It is also used to kill bacteria and quell the smell of sweat. But British
and Dutch tests have shown it to cause mutations in marine snails.
Greepeace alleges that it damages health & the environment, and the World
Wildlife Fund is calling for its global ban.
At high levels in humans, TBT is believed to cause neurological problems,
damage the
immune system and harm the liver, said Juergen Kundke, a scientist with a
German
health institute. It is also alleged to cause male impotence and hormone
problems in women. The German newspaper Die Welt says the shirts contain
more than 0.1% TBT, & that TBT can be absorbed through the skin.
