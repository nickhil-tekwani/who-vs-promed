[Transmission of both WPV and cVDPV continues to be detected for the end of the year, 2019: WPV1, confirmed in both paralytic cases as well as environmental samples in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and cVDPVs, in a paralytic case in Zambia as well as in environmental samples in Malaysia and Pakistan. In sections 3,4,5, and 6 below, more WPV1 cases have been identified since this weekly GPEI update was completed.

It is too soon to declare the end of the cVDPV outbreaks in many of the countries, as the lag time between dates of onset of illness and dates of final laboratory confirmation can be several months.

For a map showing the locations of both WPV-associated cases and cVDPV-associated cases, see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links below to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 2 years. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 24 countries: 15 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 4 in the Western Pacific, with either WPV or cVDPV isolates in their countries. An important reminder is that positive environmental samples means that the virus is circulating in the area where the samples have been obtained. Hence, if a susceptible individual is infected with the virus, there is a chance the person may develop paralytic disease.

https://arynews.tv/en/six-new-polio-cases-surface-pakistan/


Six more polio cases have surfaced in the country, including 2 in Sindh confirmed by the province's emergency operation centre (EOC), ARY News reported on Thursday [9 Jan 2020].

The 1st case in Sindh, a 3-year-old child, was reported in Union Council Laloo Raunk of Qambar district, sources at the Ministry of National Health said. Another case in the province, a 12-year-old boy, was infected by poliovirus in Union Council Sehwan of district Jamshoro.

Moreover, 2 little girls were infected by poliovirus in Punjab's Dera Ghazi Khan district. The cases of the girls, aged 6 months and 1 year, were confirmed by the concerned authorities. Chief minister of Punjab Usman Buzdar, while taking notice of the matter, has summoned report from the Ministry of Health. The chief minister has also urged concerned departments to work hard to get rid of the crippling disease.

Two more polio cases have surfaced in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, taking the province's tally to 91. KP's emergency operation centre (EOC) for polio said that a 2-year-old boy from Dera Ismail Khan and a 9-month-old girl from Lakki Marwat's tehsil Sari Naurang have been affected by the poliovirus.

The number of overall polio cases across the country has reached to 134 this year including 91 cases in KP, 24 cases in Sindh, 8 in Punjab, and 11 cases in Balochistan.

It is pertinent to mention here that the year for polio cases in the country starts from 1 Feb to end at 31 Jan.

[3] Pakistan (Sindh): 2 new cases, more details

https://pakobserver.net/emoc-confirms-two-new-cases-of-polio-special-opv-campaign-in-karachi-to-focus-on-missed-refusal-cases/


The emergency operation centre (EmOC) for polio eradication, Sindh, on Thursday [9 Jan 2020] confirmed 2 new polio cases, bringing the total number of the affected children to 24 in the province.

The EmOC spokesman emphasized that the 2 cases are not from the current [year] but pertain to 2019. He said one of the affected [was a] male child (36 months) from union council Lalu Raunk, Kambar district, who was said to have an onset date of [14 Dec 2019], with weakness on both lower limbs. According to his parents, the child did receive oral polio vaccine but no routine immunization or IPV.

The other affected child, a 144-month-old [12-year-old) boy, with an onset date of [22 Dec 2019], was tested for the poliovirus after facing weakness in his facial muscles.

The spokesman said routine immunization coverage remains a major challenge that was further aggravated due to a long gap in door-to-door campaigns last year [2019]. It was claimed that National EmOC and Sindh EmOC were trying to fight back and get polio eradication on track so as to reverse the trend.

A 2-day polio vaccination campaign aimed at focused coverage of around 60 000 under-5 [year-old] children previously deprived of the critically needed intervention against the crippling disease in 34 sensitive districts of Karachi will begin on Friday [10 Jan 2020]. The exercise is being taken on the directives of chief minister of Sindh, Syed Murad Ali Shah, with improved monitoring mechanism ensuring that the identified children may not miss the opportunity under any pretext, mainly refusals on part of their parents or community-based resistance.

Commissioner of Karachi, Iftikhar A Shalwani, chairing a meeting at his office Thursday [9 Jan 2020], reviewed the arrangements for the targeted exercise and measures for taking on board the area influentials and heads of the families of the concerned children, numbering more than 60 000. He expressed his satisfaction that members of provincial and national assemblies, along with opinion makers and religious scholars, have also committed to be on ground to play their due roles in the cause linked to quality life of children of the country.

Two new polio cases surfaced in Dera Ghazi Khan on Thursday [9 Jan 2020], an official of the Punjab Polio Control Programme confirmed.

The official said both the patients were females, aged 6 months and 12 months. One of the babies, whose left lower limb had been paralysed due to the crippling disease, belonged to Ali Wala union council, while the other, whose both lower limbs had been paralysed, hailed from Sakhi Sarwar union council of D G Khan.

He said the number of polio cases reported from Punjab this year [2020] had reached 8 with the new cases, while 134 cases were reported in 2019.

Meanwhile, Punjab chief minister Sardar Usman Buzdar sought a report from the health department about the new polio cases in DG Khan. He said urfacing [surfacing?] of poliovirus was a very serious matter, and any negligence in the anti-polio campaign would not be tolerated. "It is our collective responsibility to safeguard the future of the country, and coordinated efforts should be made to improve the situation," he said. "It is our mission to make Pakistan polio-free, and departments concerned will have to work with more zeal to save children from polio," he added.
