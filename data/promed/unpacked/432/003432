Rabies, animals - Russia (Samara region)
----------------------------------------
In 2008, 305 cases of animal rabies were reported. In addition there
was 1 human case reported in Balashov, and in 2 further human cases
the people were severely attacked by rabid animals -- a girl in
Vyazovka and a guard in the Volsky districts.

On April 9 [presumably in 2009 - Mod.MHJ] the expert council of the
regional government reviewed 2 laws on keeping domestic dogs and cats
and about administrative responsibility for its contravention.

Rabies, animals - Russia (Nizhegorodskiy region)
-------------------------------------------------
During the 1st 3 months of this year, 2009, 28 cases of rabies
[presumably animal rabies - Mod.MHJ] have been reported but for the
whole of 2008 there were only 27 animal rabies cases.

Dmitriy Nikulin, Deputy head of bureau of State Veterinary
Supervision, said that the increased incidence is connected with a
rise in the number the carrier infections. For example, the fox
population has grown from 5000 to 8000 animals. In relation to
climatic and ecological factors the most unfavorable areas for rabies
are in the central and southern districts.

During 2001-2009 years rabies has been reported in 338 animals: 227
foxes; 51 dogs; 34 cats; 3 horses; and 3 goats. Because of the
worsening situation funding for rabies vaccinations has been
increased.

there were no reports submitted for 2005, 2006 or 2008, which is not
to say that rabies cases did not occur. The disease is widespread in
Russian domestic animals and wildlife with 3679 recorded cases in
2005; 876 in the 1st half of 2006 -- no reports for the latter half;
