Rat fever diagnosed in Southern Sri Lanka
-------------------------------------------
Fatal leptospirosis, commonly known as rat fever, is raising its head
in Sri Lanka's Southern Province, health sources said.
A total of 6 patients identified as suffering from leptospirosis died
in Southern Province Matara General Hospital in the past 3 months.
According to Inquirer into Sudden Deaths in Matara, T. M. Lalith de
Silva, 20 leptospirosis deaths were reported from Matara General
Hospital in 2006.
Leptospirosis -- also known as Weil's disease, canicola fever,
canefieldfever, nanukayami fever, 7-day fever and many more -- is a
bacterial zoonotic disease caused by spirochaetes of the genus
_Leptospira_ that affects humans and a wide range of animals. There
is a common misconception that the disease is associated only with
rats. In Sri Lanka, it is believed to spread mostly among the paddy
field farmers.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by the spirochete _Leptospira_.
It is usually transmitted to humans from asymptomatic carrier animals
(for example rodents and domesticated animals, such as dogs, pigs and
cattle) that intermittently or continuously excrete the organisms in
their urine. Exposure occurs usually by contact with water or mud
contaminated by urine from these chronically infected animals.
Person-to-person spread is not known to occur.
Leptospirosis is endemic in Sri Lanka, where the annual number of
"suspected" cases was reported to be 1200 to over 2000 from 1993 to
2003; and the highest risk groups were reported to be paddy farmers
and sugar cane plantation workers (see ProMED posting 20031024.2663).
The types of exposure of patients in the current outbreak are not specified.
Leptospirosis characteristically occurs during periods of flooding.
The current outbreak in southern Sri Lanka is occurring during the
monsoon season, which brings heavy rain from May to August; heavy
rain and thunderstorms are also said to be commonplace from September
through November
(<http://www.asiahotels.com/weather/Sri_Lanka.asp>).
More than 90 percent of patients with leptospirosis recover after a
self-limited illness, but some develop a more severe illness with
renal and hepatic failure (Weil's disease) that may be fatal in 5-40
percent; therefore the 6 deaths so far in 2007 and the 20 deaths in
2006 likely represent only a tip of the iceberg of total cases of
leptospirosis in Sri Lanka. In addition, the method of diagnosis,
whether based on clinical findings, serologic data, or culture of the
organism from urine, was not specified for the current cases in the
above news release. The clinical findings in leptospirosis are
frequently non-specific and may be confused with other illnesses. For
a more detailed discussion of leptospirosis please see ProMED 20070821.2725.
