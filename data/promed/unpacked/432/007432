Doctors should be more cautious in prescribing a vital drug, as increasing
bacterial resistance could bring deadly consequences, a medical expert
warned. Klaus Stohr, of the World Health Organisation drugs resistance
surveillance and containment division, said the resistance of lethal
bacteria to drugs had become a serious global problem.
Hong Kong was the fourth location that had identified vancomycin resistant
_Staphylococcus aureus_, a new strain of superbug. The strain found was
partially resistant to vancomycin.
_Staphylococcus aureus_ are virulent bacteria that live on the skin and can
cause pneumonia and abscesses.
Vancomycin is now the last killer of some strains of the bacteria which are
already resistant to other antibiotics.
Dr Stohr, who is attending the First International Congress of the Asia
Pacific Society of Infection Control in Hong Kong, said discovery of the
superbug did not necessarily mean SAR [Special Administrative Region
doctors were worse than their overseas counterparts.
"There are two possibilities. First, perhaps Hong Kong has a good
surveillance system. Other countries may have the same problem but they did
not pick it up. "On the other hand we also know that Hong Kong has, among
Asian countries, the highest consumption per capita [of vancomycin," Dr
Stohr said.
He said Hong Kong people's ability to buy expensive drugs meant the use of
powerful antibiotics was common. "Vancomycin is very expensive. From the
income and health services provided, it is very likely vancomycin is widely
used in Hong Kong."
He appealed to all doctors to use antibiotics with caution. "If we have
[full vancomycin resistance, we have nothing to treat [patients with -
people will die as they did 50 years ago."
