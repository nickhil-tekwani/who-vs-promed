An outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is
overextending hospital capacities in Priaralye in the Kizilordinskaya
region. The number of cases is increasing, and one fatality,
following a bite by an _Ixodes_ tick, has been reported by the Kazakh
newspaper Megapolis.
A 37-year-old woman living in the village of Bidaykol has died as a
result of this dangerous infection. The staff of the regional
hospital did all that was possible to save her but without success.
A man from Togusken village in the Janakorgansk region ignored the
advice of specialists and removed a tick from his foot by himself.
Four days later, he developed dizziness, back pain and fatigue. The
diagnosis was, unambiguously, hemorrhagic fever.
In the previous season [2006], 5 cases were recorded. As of today [2
Jul 2007], this case number has already been reached, with as yet no
diminution of tick activity.

The Kizilordinskaya region is adjacent to the South Federal Region of
Russia, where CCHF is also being reported at the present time. It is
worth noting that although only 5 cases have been registered in
Kazakhstan, all of them have been severe, with one death. It is
certainly possible that there may be considerably more but less
severe cases with mild or no hemorrhagic signs and that these cases
escape detection and go undiagnosed.
In the South Federal Region of Russia, testing for CCHF is carried
out on all patients with fever who report tick bites. This may
explain why a greater number of cases of CCHF are being registered in
the South Federal Region than in Kazakhstan. - Mod.NP]
