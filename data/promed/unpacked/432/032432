Comparison of _Leishmania_ typing results obtained from 16 European clinical laboratories in 2014

Summary
-------
Leishmaniasis is endemic in southern Europe, and in other European countries cases are diagnosed in travellers who have visited affected areas both within the continent and beyond. Prompt and accurate diagnosis poses a challenge in clinical practice in Europe. Different methods exist for identification of the infecting _Leishmania_ species. Sixteen clinical laboratories in 10 European countries, plus Israel and Turkey, conducted a study to assess their genotyping performance. DNA from 21 promastigote cultures of 13 species was analysed blindly by the routinely used typing method. Five different molecular targets were used, which were analysed with PCR-based methods. Different levels of identification were achieved, and either the _Leishmania_ subgenus, species complex, or actual species were reported. The overall error rate of strains placed in the wrong complex or species was 8.5 percent. Various reasons for incorrect typing were identified. The study shows there is considerable room for improvement and standardisation of _Leishmania_ typing. The use of well validated standard operating procedures is recommended, covering testing, interpretation, and reporting guidelines. Application of the internal transcribed spacer 1 of the rDNA array should be restricted to Old World samples, while the heat-shock protein 70 gene and the mini-exon can be applied globally.

Conclusions
-----------
There is considerable room for improvement of current _Leishmania_ typing strategies, and inter-laboratory comparisons such as the one we conducted can contribute to enhance typing quality. Whichever the clinical need for determining the subgenus, complex, or species, and whichever the technology used in a particular setting, typing should be based on a well-defined and validated SOP designed by an expert in _Leishmania_ taxonomy. This SOP should cover not only testing, but also analysis and interpretation procedures, and a clear description of how species should be named and reported, taking into account the limitations of each marker and technique, and the problem of resolving closely related species or occasional inter-species hybrids. Validation should be performed on a sufficient amount of reference isolates from various geographic origins to cover each species' variability. When using sequencing, sequence errors should be avoided, and a well-validated sequence reference set is recommended over BLAST analysis using GenBank, which lacks quality control. In cases where treatment is species- or complex-dependent, clinicians should be made aware of the limitations of the technology used whenever results are reported, especially when closely related species are involved. The use of real-time PCR assays developed for specific complexes or species could speed up typing and facilitate interpretation of results, but currently no globally applicable methods are available. As previously recommended and also apparent from this analysis, hsp70 and the mini-exon currently offer the best _Leishmania_ typing tools world-wide, and the use of ITS1 should be restricted to the Old World. Setting up similar evaluations outside Europe, in institutes in endemic as well as non-endemic countries, would shed additional light on the quality of _Leishmania_ typing across the globe.

[Genotyping of _Leishmania_ parasites is important in understanding transmission and reservoir hosts. The important recommendation of this work is that techniques and reagents have to be standardized. We could add that expertise follows volume and perhaps centers only performing a few typings should submit samples to a center with a larger volume and thus more expertise. The full paper including methodologies and list of references is available from Eurosurveillance, which is open source. - Mod.EP]
