Second woman dies after legionnaire's outbreak
Victorian health authorities have confirmed that two women have died as a
result of legionnaires' disease
The number of people who have contracted the disease after visiting the
Melbourne aquarium has climbed to 18.
An 83-year-old Templestowe woman died in hospital earlier this week. She
had visited the aquarium - the source of the outbreak - on April 13. The
Human Services Department has confirmed the disease also claimed the life
of a 79-year-old woman who died at the Goulburn Base Hospital. The woman
had also been to the aquarium.
The Department's Dr John Carnie says the number of people who have disease
has risen to 18 and could climb further, with 22 people still under
investigation. Five of those who have the disease are in critical
conditions in hospital.
