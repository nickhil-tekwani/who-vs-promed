New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Pak Sha Tseun, Wong Nai Tun, Yuen Long , Hong Kong
Date of start of the outbreak: 2 Feb 2021
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Total affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 3200 / 70 / 10 / 245 / 0
Affected population: Samples taken from a local licensed pig farm tested positive for African swine fever virus.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Swine / 2.19 / 0.31 / 14.29 / 7.97
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: The government's ASF contingency plan has been activated. Pig movement from the index and the 3 farms located within 3km [approx. 1.8mi] of the outbreak was immediately suspended. A total of 245 pigs from the index farm have been killed and disposed of. Further testing on the index farm is being conducted. No reports of abnormalities on from pig farms outside the 3km [approx. 1.8mi] zone have been received. Enhanced inspection, surveillance and investigation is continuing.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; screening; traceability; quarantine; official destruction of animal products; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; selective killing and disposal, zoning; disinfection; ante- and post-mortem inspections; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals.

Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory, Agriculture Fisheries and Conservation Department (national laboratory) / Swine / Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 3 Feb 2021 / Positive
Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory, Agriculture Fisheries and Conservation Department (national laboratory) / Swine / Real-time PCR / 3 Feb 2021 / Positive

[In 2019 Hong Kong reported 3 cases of African swine fever. In all these cases the virus was detected in tissue samples collected from pigs in the slaughterhouse. Those events reported in 2019 have been resolved.

The following abstract comes from a scientific article:
Das S, Deka P, Deka P, et al. (2021). African swine fever: Etiology, epidemiology, control strategies and progress toward vaccine development: A comprehensive review. Journal of Entomology and Zoology Studies 2021; 9(1): 919-929. Available at:

Abstract:

"African swine fever (ASF) is a fatal viral disease caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV), the only known DNA arbovirus, of family _Asfarviridae_, genus _Asfivirus_, which can cause substantial morbidity and mortality events in domestic and wild pigs of all ages and sexes. ASF continues to be a threat to the global pig industry in Africa, Europe and recently in Asia. ASFV can be transmitted by 3 different modes: direct, indirect, and vector-borne. Direct transmission can occur through contact with infected pigs and their products; indirect transmission occurs from contaminated fomites; and vector-borne transmission is typically via the _Ornithodoros_ ticks. Depending on the existence of wild reservoirs, competent tick vectors, and geographical characteristics, different epidemiological scenarios exist. The clinical presentations vary from per-acute to chronic disease; including asymptomatic courses according to virulence of viral strains and immune status of the susceptible host. The disease is characterized by sudden death, high fever, and haemorrhages in the skin and internal organs with mortality rates approaching up to 100%. Currently, there is no approved vaccine for ASF. The control and eradication measures are based on early detection combined with strict quarantine and biosecurity. In this review, we summarise ASFV with respect to the current global situation, the disease it causes, and different epidemiological scenarios including the potential vectors. We discuss the control methods in domestic and wild pigs and the current state in the development of vaccines and antivirals against ASFV. Furthermore, existing ASFV research gaps and future perspectives in developing an efficacious vaccine for controlling ASF are highlighted briefly."
