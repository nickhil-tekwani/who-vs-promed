[The following report was received from Dr. Caramello, Infectious Diseases
and Tropical Medicine Units A, Amedeo di Savoia Hospital, C. Svizzera 164,
10149 Torino, Italy. - Mod.TY]
We would like to report a case of Japanese encephalitis in a traveler
returning from a 3-week trip to Viet Nam. He visited Ho Chi Minh City
(24-28 Apr, 10-16 May, 2006), Hanoi (28-29 Apr and 10 May, 2006), Halong
Bay (29 Apr - 3 May, 2006), Haipong (4 May, 2006), Mai Son (5 May, 2006),
Dien Bien Phu (6 May, 2006), and Sapa (7-9 May, 2006).
He was first symptomatic on 16 May 2006, while on his return flight. The
diagnosis of JE was confirmed by increase of serology titre
(immunofluorescence) on serum (IgM from low positivity to 1:10 and IgG from
1:40 to 1:640) and CSF (IgG from 1:2 to >1:16). The patient recovered
without neurologic sequelae and was discharged.

[Japanese encephalitis (JE) has been acquired in Asia before by patients
who became ill in Europe (see archives, below). There is no risk of the
virus becoming established in Europe from these patients.
