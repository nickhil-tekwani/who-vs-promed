The pre prion protein has limited genetic diversity. Does inbreeding of
cattle affect vulnerability, transmissibility, latency to onset, or other
BSE outcome?<<

The results of the 7-year cohort study showed a small amount of vertical
transmission, which was originally assumed by MAFF and SEAC to be maternal
transmission, although at the time I suggested they ought to have considered
the possibility of genetic predisposition. More recently they have come
around to the view that both may be involved and SEAC has called for
research into genetic predisposition. I shall be surprised if it does not
prove to be a factor.
I am not aware of any evidence in respect of the other outcomes queried.
>>ARE there beef strains (breeds) that are more resistant?<<
Apparent variations among breeds need to be related to the populations of
those breeds, For example, an apparent huge majority of BSE cows being
Friesian-Holsteins is a reflection of the fact that the huge majority of
dairy cows in the UK are Friesian-Holsteins. After relating to breed
populations and other factors (such as how long dairy cows on average live
and what they were fed on, compared with beef sucklers , I am not aware of
any evidence that particular breeds are more or less susceptible than others.
