The source of infection is still under investigation. So far, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.

The Chinese government continues to take the following measures:
- strengthen surveillance and situation analysis;
- reinforce case management and treatment;
- conduct risk communication with the public and release information;
- strengthen international collaboration and communication; and
- conduct scientific studies.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions.
