Based on what I have read on ProMED and scattered media reports, it is hard
to determine what is going on in New York City, other than that there are
confirmed cases of SLE. There has been no mention of vector surveillance.
Since the most probable vector is _Culex pipiens pipiens_, several
interesting questions come to mind. First has anybody noticed this
mosquito biting man? _Cx pipiens_ prefers birds! In 1975 in Illinois it
was we (Horsfall and Novak) observed that large numbers of _Cx pipiens_
began feeding on humans beginning early in the summer months and in
August/September the 1975 SLE outbreak began. This hit Illinois especially
hard. Has anybody noticed increased numbers of adults, i.e. light trap
collections, in New York? It sound as though the NYC Health Department has
no surveillance at all. NY has all of the mosquito species necessary for
an outbreak, _Cx restuans_, _Cx p.pipiens_, _Cx salinarius_.
In terms of larval breeding habitats for these vectors, one set of habitats
found in close association with humans is street runoff catch basins. Also,
numerous underground habitats for a variety of utilities can produce hoards
of potential vectors in close proximity to dwellings. We have found that
these sites can be very productive for larvae and as resting sites for
adults in Central Illinois. Similar situations occur in [at least Chicago
and Houston TX. Houston TX SLE control program focuses on underground
breeding and resting sites.
An outbreak in New Jersey, especially in the Newark area, should be high on
the list as a potential danger. However unless there is an MD who might
recognize SLE, hospitalization of a patient may be the only surveillance
tool in this area. There are many excellent mosquito control districts in
NJ but I do not know if one or more are located in this area.
At this point everything seems based on speculation. Vigilance was at one
time the banner for public health. For mosquito-borne pathogens quality
surveillance and mosquito control should be the standard. Is this just a
wake-up call?

[It might serve as a wake-up call, Bob, but it probably won't. In my
opinion, the field of arbovirology has been partially coopted by economics,
by the loss of key people (economics and retirements), and by those who
would solve epidemiologic problems without going out in the rain. Unless
any epidemic expands greatly, or a Congressperson's granddaughter dies, or
a new virus is discovered, the ship seems to move on, leaving no wake.
The US Centers for Disease Control has arbovirus and vector mosquito
experts available for consultation. Whether they are being utilized in the
NY situation is unknown to ProMED. It is inconceivable that all we know is
all there is to know about this fascinating outbreak. However, the longer
we go without direct input of information from NYC officials, the more I
will suspect that we know all there is to know.
Here's a harsh reality, which most recognize but no one articulates. Were
you in charge of public health in a large city, a city in which venereal
diseases (including AIDS), antibiotic resistant tuberculosis, the need for
childhood vaccination campaigns, safeguarding water supplies, etc., (ad
nauseum) take up most or all of the budget and time, would a few cases of
this or that seeming oddity be high on your priority list -- with the first
mosquito-killing frost coming? - Mod.CHC
