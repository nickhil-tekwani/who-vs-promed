New Zealand is planning to release a rabbit virus across the country, in an attempt to cull the ballooning wild population. Wild rabbits are seen as a pest in parts of the country and the virus, known as RHDV1-K5, will be released from March [2018]. Farming groups have welcomed the move while others have raised concerns including the risk it may pose to pet rabbits.

Why are rabbits such a big problem in New Zealand?
Rabbits were introduced to New Zealand around the 1830s and have long created problems for farmers. Wild rabbits compete with livestock for pasture and also cause land damage from burrowing. According to the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI), rabbits cost an average of 50 million New Zealand dollars (NZD; USD36m; 18.7m pounds sterling) in lost production and more than NZD 25m (USD18m) in pest control each year.

How can you control a rabbit population?
The main methods are shooting, poisoning, fumigation of burrows and, less drastically, installing rabbit-proof fencing. But officials argue the problem has got so big those solutions don't go far enough. An earlier strain of the rabbit haemorrhagic disease Virus (RHDV) was introduced to New Zealand in 1997. The virus, which only affects rabbits and no other animals, was initially very effective but after more than 20 years the rabbits have become immune to it.

The virus due to be released next month [March 2018] is a new Korean strain, known as RHDV1-K5. It affects an animal's internal organs, causing fever and spasms, blood clots and respiratory failure. According to the MPI, this strain works faster, killing rabbits within 2 to 4 days of infection.

What has reaction been?
People are divided. New Zealand's Federated Farmers (FF) said the move was a "huge relief. There are some desperate farmers out there," the spokesman Andrew Simpson told the BBC. "If another year goes by without [the] virus, the ecological damage to some properties would be mind-numbing." But Arnja Dale, from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said the decision to release the virus was disappointing given "the suffering it will cause affected rabbits and the potential risk to companion rabbits. [We] advocate for the use of more humane methods," she said. The SPCA says a vaccine which is being made available for pet rabbits has not been "adequately tested...[with] not yet sufficient evidence that it will provide sufficient protection". But the MPI says vaccinated domestic rabbits will be safe. It said RHDV1-K5 was released in Australia last year [2017], with no reports of vaccinated pet rabbits dying from the virus strain.

[Domestic rabbits should be vaccinated, or kept indoors. It is reassuring to know Australia has had no reports of domestic rabbits being affected. While this sounds harsh, rabbits can be quite a nuisance to farms with much damage caused to the land and loss in production which can really harm a producer's finances. Other strains, as mentioned in the article, have been released in New Zealand and Australia previously.

In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus causing an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay, and Reunion Island.

RHDV is a highly virulent lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. RHD is characterized by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90 per cent), and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival or oral routes.

Because of these characteristics of RHDV, it was deliberately released in Australia and New Zealand. There, RHD has reduced rabbit abundance, particularly in dry regions, but rabbits in cooler, high-rainfall areas have been able to maintain their populations. In Australia and New Zealand, RHD has raised the prospects for managing rabbits in low rainfall areas and brought substantial economic and environmental benefits. It is expected that after many generations the defense strategies of rabbits evolve to resist and/or tolerate RHDV, so introduction of a novel strain might enable boosting the efficiency of RHD as a biological control. This particular strain RHDV1-K5, may be a magic potion or another one the rabbits adapt to over time.

I express my appreciation to fellow moderator PMB for portions of this comment.
