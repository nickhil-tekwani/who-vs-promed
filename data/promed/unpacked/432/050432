Health officials say a deadly outbreak of listeriosis has been linked to raw milk from an organic farm in Pennsylvania. The illnesses happened in 2014, but it took investigators until now to determine the cause. Two patients got sick from the bacteria, one in California and one in Florida, and the patient in Florida died.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday [18 Mar 2016] that the outbreak had been traced to unpasteurized raw milk produced by Miller's Organic Farm in Bird-In-Hand, Pennsylvania.

In January [2016], the FDA found _Listeria_ in samples of raw chocolate milk produced by the same company and said genetic testing confirmed it was closely related to the strain that sent the 2 patients to the hospital in 2014.

Amos Miller, the owner of Miller's Organic Farm, said the company operates as a private membership club and only supplies milk and other farm-grown products to members. It does not distribute to retail stores or other outlets. Miller told CBS News the company is still selling raw milk and is not aware of any health problems. "I don't know that it was proved it's on the farm here," he said. "We hope and pray for the best."

Public health officials have long advised people not to drink raw milk or consume other unpasteurized dairy products because of the risk that it may contain dangerous pathogens like _Listeria_, _Salmonella_, _Escherichia coli_ and _Campylobacter_ bacteria. Pasteurized milk has been heated to high enough temperatures to kill the bacteria.

There have been a number of other widely publicized listeriosis outbreaks in recent years, including one last year traced to Blue Bell Creameries ice cream which killed 3 people and sickened 10. In 2014, 7 people died from listeriosis in caramel apples.

Young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems are at highest risk of severe illness from listeriosis. It's also a serious concern for pregnant women as the bacteria can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery or life-threatening infections in newborns.

The CDC says symptoms of listeriosis usually develop within a few days of eating contaminated food and may include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions. Life-threatening complications can develop if the bacteria get into the bloodstream or central nervous system.

Although no recall related to this latest outbreak has been announced, the CDC warned consumers to be wary. "Because _Listeria_ was recently found in raw milk produced by Miller's Organic Farm, CDC is concerned that conditions may exist at the farm that may cause further contamination of raw milk and raw dairy products distributed by this company and make people sick," the CDC said in a statement.

[Unpasteurized milk is an important vehicle for transmission of pathogens, which include _Brucella _ species, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella burnetii_, and Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_. In 1987, the United States Food and Drug Administration prohibited distribution of unpasteurized dairy products in interstate commerce for sale to consumers (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article).

However, sale of unpasteurized dairy products within the state where they are produced is regulated by each state, and some states permit sale of these products within these states. To circumvent these regulations for commercial sale of unpasteurized milk, some states allow milk producers to distribute unpasteurized milk through cow-leasing programs, whereby members purchase shares in dairy cows in exchange for a percentage of the milk produced (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5125a2.htm).

Exactly what the arrangement described as a "private membership club" that the unpasteurized milk producer in Pennsylvania had with its "members" who developed listeriosis, one in California and one in Florida, is not detailed in the news report above. The clinical isolates from the 2 cases had a genotype that was closely related to the strains isolated from raw chocolate milk produced by the same company. No recall related to this latest outbreak has been announced.
