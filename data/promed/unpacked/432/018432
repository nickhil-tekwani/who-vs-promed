Horses at Rolling Hills Ranch stable in Bridgeville, Allegheny County
have been quarantined after at least 3 horses tested positive for the
neurologic form of equine herpesvirus, or EHV-1, Agriculture
Secretary Dennis Wolff said today [28 Jul 2009]. "Equine herpesvirus
causes upper respiratory infection and can cause severe neurological
disease in horses," said Wolff. "The quarantine was put in place to
restrict the movement of horses from the stable and contain the
virus." There is no threat to human health from EHV-1.

The quarantine covers the entire property, including 5 barns housing
more than 100 horses. It will remain in effect until a period of 21
days has elapsed without relevant clinical signs in any horses. At
that point, all horses will be tested for EHV-1, and the quarantine
will be released when all horses test negative.

The attending veterinarian at Rolling Hills Ranch recognized symptoms
in several horses consistent with the neurologic form of EHV-1 and
alerted the Bureau of Animal Health and Diagnostic Services on 19 Jul
2009. Symptoms of the neurologic form of EHV-1 include loss of
coordination, weakness or paralysis of the hind limbs, and
incontinence. While other forms of EHV-1 occur commonly in horses,
the neurologic form is considered a dangerous transmissible disease.
Presently, the bureau is testing and monitoring horses at Rolling
Hills Ranch. Horse owners who have boarded their animals at the
facility since 7 Jul 2009 should contact their local veterinarian if
the horse exhibits symptoms of the neurologic form of EHV-1.

Owners with further concerns may call the Department of Agriculture's
Bureau of Animal Health and Diagnostic Services at 717-772-2852. For
