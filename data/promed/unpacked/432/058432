Fish disease breaks out in Netrakona
------------------------------------
Fish disease has broken out in 3 upazilas (townships) of the district in an
epidemic form, killing a large number of fish. The upazilas are Sadar,
Atpara, and Kalmakanda. According to sources, fish with the disease develop
ulcers and die within a week. The species of fish that are being attacked
with the disease are koi, puti, tegra, taki, and shoal.
A source in the district Fisheries Department said the fish disease is
caused by a virus found in bodies of water like ponds, canals, and ditches.
Fishermen and fish cultivators are incurring heavy losses due to the
outbreak of the disease, as many people have stopped purchasing these kinds
of fish.
Fish disease broke out in 5 upazilas of the district in an epidemic form,
killing a large number of fishes in 2000. As a result, some species of fish
disappeared from the district: vetki, chanda, and deshi puta.
Some fish cultivators said that the Fisheries Department had not taken any
preventive measures. Some local fish cultivators told this correspondent
that if preventive measures are not taken on an urgent basis to check the
disease, the above named species of fish will become extinct, triggering an
acute fish crisis in the district.

[Similar symptoms affecting the same fish species in Bangladesh were
reported in the same newspaper and almost on the same date (31 Mar) in 2001
(see 20010331.0648)... Seasonality?! The Office Internationale des
Epizooties reported last year an ulcerative syndrome in carp in Pakistan,
suspected to be caused by Koi herpesvirus. Additional information on
Bangladeshi epidemiological/lab investigations will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
