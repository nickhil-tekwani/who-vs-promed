Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 2

Outbreak location 1: Klobateme, Zio, Maritime
Date of start of the outbreak: 19 Jun 2021
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds / 1000 / 189 / 189 / 811 / 0 / 0
Affected population: First cases began on 19 Jun 2021; it is a flock of 1000 6-month-old layers in two buildings.

Outbreak location 2: Djagble-Kleme, Zio, Maritime
Date of start of the outbreak: 1 Jun 2021
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds / 1000 / 563 / 563 / 437 / 0 / 0
Affected population: First cases started on [1 Jun 2021]; there are 2 flocks of laying hens with 500 animals each; one is being culled, but the owner has kept it until the 2nd flock reaches its peak of production; the other one is starting to lay. Both flocks are in a building separated on the whole width by a barrier made of bamboo wood.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Two infected farms, which are approximately 5 km apart as the crow flies, each with a population of 1000 layers. Both infected farms are more or less located in urban areas. The 1st one is in a house with no physical separation between the rearing building (nor foot baths) and the house yard. There are almost no biosecurity measures applied. The 2nd farm is much more isolated, with some biosecurity measures. In both cases, eggs are sold on the premises without any biosecurity measures for the management of the trays. Given the numerous failures in the application of biosecurity measures, the precise source of the infection could not be determined through the traceability survey, although these 2 farms have in common the fact that the customers are served on the premises and inside the farm's fence.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: stamping out; disinfection; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; official destruction of animal products; quarantine; movement control inside the country; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; traceability

Domestic control measures to be applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone
