Disease caused by rats is killing the dogs in El Pozon
------------------------------------------------------
The existence of large numbers of rodents in the sector of Ciudadela
La Paz suburb of El Pozon led to a dog become infected with
leptospirosis, a disease caused by bacteria from rats. The dog died a
few days ago, causing alarm among the inhabitants.

[It was] said that there was great fear in the community for which
they have requested the Administrative Department of District Health,
DADIS, urgently for a de-ratting day.

"It was a 7-month-old pitbull dog that consumed a food in a courtyard
that was contaminated by rats, and died. The whole body was so
congested that it took on the color of an achote. "That's worrisome,
"said the dignitary of the Community Action Board.

The community representative said that the DADIS has sent
communications about the decision to eliminate rats in the area but
the [activity] has not yet been implemented.

"It happened in a dog, imagine later in a human. This can convert
into more of an epidemic we already have" emphasize Pajaro Garcia.

Leptospirosis is a spirochetal infection that is distributed widely
throughout the world in warm climates. It is caused by exposure to
_Leptospira_ bacteria, in fresh (not salty) water, wet soil, or
vegetation that has been contaminated by the urine of chronically
infected animals. Leptospirosis affects humans and a variety of
animals including dogs, cattle, pigs, and rodents. Outbreaks
frequently follow heavy rainfalls, flooding with fresh water and
rodent infestation.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors
or with animals, for example, workers in wet agricultural settings
(such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers,
trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers,
dairy farmers, or military personnel. Also leptospirosis is a risk
during recreational activities, such as camping, fresh water
swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking,
that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds
contaminated by urine from leptospire-infected animals, as well as
household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents
