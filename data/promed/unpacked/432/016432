New Strain of Wheat Rust Appears in Africa
-----------------------------------------------
Biologists warned Thursday [8 Sep 2005] that a virulent new strain of a
previously controlled plant disease had emerged in East Africa and could
wipe out 10 percent of the world's wheat production if its spread is not
halted.
The fungus that causes wheat stem rust (WSR), _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp.
_tritici_, produces a rusty color on wheat stems and slowly destroys the
plant. It was controlled in the late 1950's and 1960's through the
groundbreaking work of Norman Borlaug, an American who won the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1970 for developing high-yield grains that led to the green
revolution. Dr. Borlaug, now 91, spoke at a news conference on Thursday [8
Sep 2005] in Nairobi and called attention to the new threat. "Nobody's seen
an epidemic for 50 years, nobody in this room except myself," he said.
"Maybe we got too complacent."
After the new WSR strain fungus emerged -- named Ug99, for Uganda 1999 --
it seemed to disappear for a couple of years. It re-emerged in Kenya in
2001 and in Ethiopia 2 years later, said Ravi Singh, a plant pathologist
with the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), a
nonprofit research group that convened an expert panel to study the
resurgent disease. The panel's report, to which Dr. Borlaug contributed,
was released at the news conference.
"It's spreading, and that's why we're sounding the alarm now," Dr. Singh
said. WSR spreads by wind-borne spores or on the clothing of travelers. The
panel's report warns that urgent action is needed if the world's wheat
producers are to be spared. A 10 percent reduction in global wheat yield
would mean a crop loss of 60 million tons, worth USD 9 billion, said Ronnie
Coffman, chairman of the panel and a professor of plant breeding and
genetics at Cornell University.
"It is only a matter of time before Ug99 reaches across the Saudi Arabian
peninsula and into the Middle East, South Asia and, eventually, East Asia
and the Americas," the report said.
A Global Rust Initiative has been set up in Nairobi to monitor the progress
of the disease and begin the process of breeding and disseminating new
resistant wheat varieties. In the 1950's, wheat rust devastated crops in
North America, affecting 3/4ths of some varieties. Since then, scientists
have worked to develop high-yielding varieties that resist ever-emerging
diseases.
Wheat grown in East Africa had been resistant to the disease for the last
40 years. But the new strain has decimated local varieties.
Industrial farmers grow most of Kenya's wheat, and they have been spraying
their crops several times a year to control WSR. But wheat rust could have
a devastating effect in countries like Ethiopia and India, where local
farmers grow the bulk of the wheat, and chemicals might prove too costly.
Dr. Masa Iwanaga, the Director-General of CIMMYT, said his organization had
compiled 165 000 different genetic varieties of wheat over the years,
giving scientists a head start in searching for strains resistant to the
new variety.

[The origin of strain Ug99 was not unexpected. Evolution of new strains of
pathogens is a constant process, and the arrival of a new strain, Ug99,
presents a challenge to wheat producers worldwide. The new strain was
detected in a test group of about 30 percent of experimental wheat lines
growing in Uganda, a "hot spot" notorious for rust diseases. The concern is
that spores of Ug99 are undoubtedly destined to reach susceptible wheat
cultivars in the Saudi Arabian peninsula and the Middle East, South Asia
and, eventually, East Asia and the Americas. Wheat cultivars grown in East
Africa have remained resistant to WSR for the past 40 years, but Ug99 has
decimated local cultivars. WSR occurs wherever wheat is grown, and yield
losses can range up to 70 percent over a large area, and infected fields
can be totally destroyed. Damage is greatest when the disease becomes
severe before the grain is completely formed. In areas favorable for
disease development, susceptible cultivars cannot be grown. Grain is
shriveled due to the damage to the conducting tissue, resulting in less
nutrient being transported to the grain. Severe disease can cause straw
breakage, resulting in a loss of wheat spikes during combine harvesting.
