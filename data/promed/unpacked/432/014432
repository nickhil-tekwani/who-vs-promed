The Department of Livestock, Sindh has said that evidence has been gathered that points to the dead Australian sheep being affected by a deadly anthrax infection.

The day-to-day developments in connection with the Australian sheep imported to Pakistan continue to give a new twist to the story. Only yesterday [19 Sep 2012], the discovery of thousands of these sheep on a private compound in Malir district had raised new questions. Out of these, 6 were found dead with bleeding mouths. More dead sheep were also discovered buried, and these had mouths infested with parasites [more likely to be maggots. - Mod.MHJ].

Now, a fresh disclosure hints at the dead sheep being infected by the deadly anthrax virus [sic]. Originally, it was believed that the sheep suffered from scabby mouth disease.

Due to the possible presence of anthrax, the Department of Livestock has refused to get the post-mortem done on the dead sheep. The reason is clear. The deadly anthrax virus can even kill the staff carrying out the post-mortem of the sheep [only if you are grossly careless. - Mod.MHJ].

Director of the Department of Livestock Nazir Kalhoro has said that, after the evidence hinting at the presence of anthrax, arrangements are now being made to bury these sheep with the help of machines. Only dead sheep which did not contract anthrax will be put through post-mortem, he added.

[The reason for the anthrax suspicion is, at best, not obvious, based on the account of this journalist's report. I suspect we are witnessing an incident of bureaucratic NIMBY ("Not in my back yard") to avoid responsibility and to point fingers at the importers. Logically, such disease events involving large international shipments of sheep are not unique, and there is probably a veterinary and commercial collection of them going back decades in the region. - Mod.MHJ
