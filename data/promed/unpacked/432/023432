In a monthly update on zoonotic flu strains, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently noted reports of human cases of H5N1, H5N6, and H7N9 avian flu that it received between 25 Feb and 4 Apr [2016], all of which were acknowledged in earlier reports from various official sources.

The WHO, however, included more details about 4 recent H5N1 patients in Egypt -- all female and 3 of them children, which fits with earlier patterns in the country.

The 4 Egyptian cases were previously reported but with very few epidemiologic details by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization. Health officials have been closely watching developments in Egypt, because the country had an unprecedented surge of cases at about this time last year [2015].

Two of the H5N1 patients are from Giza governorate, a 70-year-old woman who is in critical condition and a 5-year-old girl who recovered. A 1-year-old girl in Sohag governorate and a 7-year-old girl in Cairo have also recovered. The 3 girls were exposed to live or dead poultry, while the investigation into the virus source is still under investigation for the older woman, the WHO said.

Since 2003 the agency has recorded 850 H5N1 infections, 449 of them fatal, in 16 countries.

[Most A(H5) influenza human cases have history of exposure through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the viruses continue to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Even though small clusters of A(H5N1) virus infections have been reported previously, including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that the A(H5) viruses are still essentially avian and have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. - Mod.UBA
