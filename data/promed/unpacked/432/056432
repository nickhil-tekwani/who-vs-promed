LYME DISEASE - ESTONIA (SAAREMAA) (02): BACKGROUND

A recent ProMED-mail posting is a reminder that Lyme disease is extremely
common in the Baltic region. In fact, disease rates are several fold higher
in this area than in the USA (see graph at
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/Lyme-Baltic.jpg>).
Additional background data abstracted from GIDEON (primary references
available on request):
The 1st cases (3) of Lyme borreliosis in Lithuania were diagnosed in 1987;
and Estonia reported its 1st cases in 1988.
Endemic foci exist in the western, eastern, and southern regions of
Estonia. The areas of highest risk are concentrated along the Finnish Gulf
coast in Harjumaa and Western Virumaa, in Parnumaa and Eastern Virumaa
counties, and on the island of Saaremaa.
In Latvia, 2.7 per cent of workers in high-risk occupations and 3 per cent
of healthy persons in the Karksi Nuia region (south) of Estonia are
seropositive.
_Ixodes ricinus_ is abundant in Estonia, and _Ixodes persulcatus_ is found
in the east and south of the country; 3 per cent of _I. ricinus_ adults and
5 per cent of the _I. persulcatus_ adults are infected with _Borrelia
burgdorferi_; 31 per cent in Narva-Joesuu, 12 per cent in Western Virumaa,
and 14 per cent in Tartumaa. Borreliae are found in 15 per cent of ticks
(_I. ricinus_) on Vormsi Island. Tick infection by _B. afzelii_ and _B.
garinii_ has also been demonstrated.
_B. afzelii_ is the dominant species among _I. ricinus_ and _I.
persulcatus_ in Latvia, followed by _B. garinii_ and _B. burgdorferi_ (1993
to 2002). In Lithuania, 11 per cent of adults and 1 per cent of nymphal _I.
ricinus_ ticks are infected with Borrelia (1988 to 1991).

[A picture of the dorsum of an adult ixodes tick can be found at
<http://z.about.com/d/arthritis/1/0/E/2/Ixodesnymphstage350x235.jpg>. One
way of distinguishing ixodes from dermacentor (another common tick) is the
absence of the characteristic festoons, the box-like structures on the
posterior end of the scutum, the dorsal shield of the tick. Festoons can be
seen on a dermacentor tick at
<http://stri.discoverlife.org/IM/I_GA/0000/640/Dermacentor_variabilis,_female,_top,I_GA4.jpg>.
In addition, ixodes ticks have, on the ventral side, an anal groove, which
can be seen at <http://wihort.uwex.edu/images/DeerTicks2.jpg>); dermacentor
ticks do not.
ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Berger for his continuing contributions. A map of
