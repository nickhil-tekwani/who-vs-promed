An Ebola flare-up in eastern Congo may spread again after a patient escaped from a clinic, complicating efforts to contain the disease that has infected 6 people since last week, the World Health Organization said on Sunday [19 Apr 2020].

The Democratic Republic of Congo was 2 days away from declaring the end of the world's 2nd-largest Ebola epidemic when a new chain of infection was discovered on 10 Apr 2020, following more than 7 weeks without a new case.

Since then, health authorities have sought to contain any renewed spread of infections.

This is a very bad situation as it could easily lead to a new outbreak and not a single chain of transmission as the 1st few cases appeared to be. The country can afford to address neither emotionally nor financially Ebola cases flaring up again at the same time that COVID-19 cases are increasing as well as a high incidence of other endemic diseases. - Mod.LK]

The World Health Organization said on Friday [17 Apr 202] that [6] new Ebola infections have been recorded in eastern Congo since last week [week of 6 Apr 2020] in a new flare-up just as the government was about to declare an end to the deadly epidemic.]

Small outbreaks or one-off transmissions are common towards the end of an epidemic. Health workers are often able to prevent the virus spreading out of control by quarantining and vaccinating contacts of new cases.

On 9 Apr 2020, a 26-year-old electrician died of the hemorrhagic fever in the eastern town of Beni 2 days before the Democratic Republic of Congo planned to declare an end to the Ebola outbreak, which has killed more than 2200 people since its onset in August 2018.

The 2 newest cases were a 43-year-old woman and a 28-year-old motorbike-taxi driver who had brought the electrician to the hospital, according to Boubacar Diallo, deputy incident manager for the WHO's Ebola response operation.

It was unclear if the woman was linked to the other cases in a new chain of transmission, he said, but the new cases forced Congo's national government to shelve its declaration of an end to the epidemic.

Two new vaccines have had a major impact in containing Ebola, but public mistrust and militia attacks have prevented health workers from reaching some areas hit by the virus.

Demonstrators blocked roads in Beni with rocks on Thursday morning [16 Apr 2020], protesting over the authorities' handling of the latest Ebola flare-up and demanding all Ebola test results be verified by laboratories in eastern Congo's main city Goma and in the capital Kinshasa in the west of the vast Central African nation.

Health teams were delayed by the protesters but eventually able to resume their work tracing those who came into contact with those newly infected by Ebola, Diallo said. Police said they arrested 4 people.

Late last year [2019] deadly attacks on health centres in and around Beni forced aid groups to suspend operations and withdraw staff from the last strongholds of the epidemic.

Congo, one of the world's poorest countries where most people have scant access to modern health care, has also reported 287 cases of the new coronavirus and 23 deaths from the global pandemic.

DRC reports 2 more Ebola cases in Beni
--------------------------------------
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has tracked 2 new Ebola cases, raising the outbreak's resurgence total to 5 cases [note WHO most recent case number is 6] that have emerged just as the country was poised to announce an end to an outbreak that began in August 2018.

All 5 of the recent cases have been in Beni, one of the hot spots of the outbreak.

Yesterday [16 Apr 2020] demonstrations broke out across Beni as citizens criticized the government's response to the flare-up of cases and demanded all Ebola test results be verified by laboratories in eastern Congo's main city of Goma and in the capital, Kinshasa, Reuters said.

[3] Response
Date: Mon 13 Apr 2020
Source: The New Humanitarian [abridged, edited]
https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news-feature/2020/04/13/congo-coronavirus-ebola-new-case


When the 1st case of COVID-19 in the Democratic Republic of Congo was declared in early March [2020], the country's once-packed Ebola treatment centres had been empty for weeks. It was hoped resources could be shifted to combat the new disease.

But on Friday [10 Apr 2020] -- just 2 days before the World Health Organisation was due to announce an end to an Ebola outbreak that has left more than 2200 people dead -- a new case was reported in the eastern city of Beni. [see above]

As the spread of coronavirus [COVID-19] accelerates across the country, health authorities now have to juggle both responses -- while also treating those affected by the world's worst measles epidemic, an outbreak of cholera, and the victims of Congo's many ongoing conflicts.

Unlike Ebola, which was contained to the east, COVID-19 has already spread from the bustling capital city, Kinshasa, to the country's conflict-affected eastern provinces: 235 cases have been reported in total. Unlike Ebola, there is no vaccine and no proven drug therapies. And, with countries around the world all battling the same problem, aid groups said external funding will be much harder to come by.

A series of mixed messages on new cases and containment measures -- including the abrupt cancellation of a planned lockdown in Kinshasa -- has meanwhile reduced public trust in the government's ability to manage the pandemic.

And heavy-handed strategies deployed by security forces tasked with ensuring adherence to containment rules have triggered concern that mistakes made during Congo's "militarised" Ebola response are already being repeated.

"In some ways the biggest danger is the overconfidence of believing that because we've just dealt with Ebola... we can deal with this," said Tariq Riebl, an official with the UN's Ebola emergency response. "This is a completely different ball game."

Funding gaps
------------
With the end of Ebola it was hoped some of the resources amassed over the course of the 20-month epidemic -- from treatment centres and laboratories to health workers trained to manage infectious diseases -- could be put to new use.

Those plans may now need to be revised as treatment centres reopen for Ebola, responders scramble to trace dozens of contacts of the new case -- a deceased 26-year old man -- and an epidemiological investigation into the source of the infection commences.

The length of time that passed between the man's death and the last known case of Ebola on 17 Feb 2020 suggests chains of transmission may have gone undetected by responders, and that more cases could soon be discovered.

Even if they don't, it will now be at least 42 days -- twice the 21-day incubation period during which transmission between people normally occurs -- before the epidemic can be formally declared over.

While hundreds of millions of dollars were spent fighting Ebola, funding is now in short-supply according to the WHO, which said USD 20 million is needed to ensure response teams can continue to operate on the ground.

The Congolese government has meanwhile budgeted USD 135 million to help combat COVID-19 -- which threatens a larger number of people in a far greater geographical area than Ebola -- but its resources are limited and external funding has not been secured.

Though some Ebola funds were spent building new medical facilities, aid workers cautioned that little was invested in Congo's existing health system, leaving it poorly prepared to deal with COVID-19.

There is currently just one laboratory in Kinshasa with the materials needed to test samples in the country of roughly 80 million people, which is causing long delays in obtaining results.

"The money came in [for Ebola], but was used mainly by the NGOs themselves, which didn't sufficiently involve or strengthen the national health system," said Desire Nturo, Ebola response coordinator for FHI 360, a US NGO.

Aid groups said they are keen to help the country manage the new outbreak -- some have already adapted their programmes to include coronavirus prevention messages -- but border closures and travel restrictions may hinder their efforts to deploy staff.

"For Ebola, we had millions of dollars, 3000-odd cases, and thousands of staff," said the UN's Riebl. "For coronavirus it is going to be the exact inverse. We're going to have millions of cases, but we're not going to have the same coverage, because so many people are leaving Congo."

Mixed messages
--------------
Though Congo has experience stamping out 9 previous Ebola outbreaks, the current one -- which became the world's 2nd deadliest ever -- has been marred by distrust between residents and responders that has led to hundreds of attacks on healthcare workers, treatment centres, and patients.

Aid groups said the outbreak offers lessons for coronavirus, in particular the importance of ensuring local communities and health workers do not feel left out of relief efforts.

Humanitarian organisations are expected to take a backseat in the coronavirus response, which will be managed through the national health system, with coordination structures already set up in the capital and provinces.

"That is different from what we saw during the Ebola response, where we had a parallel coordination," said Dr Rigo Fraterne Muhayangabo, country director for International Medical Corps in Congo. "It gives hope that we will not see the same side-effects."

But signs of mistrust in the government have already emerged.

[It, unfortunately, appears the lessons learned from Ebola on building community trust are now having to be relearned during the coronavirus outbreak. This on top of the other diseases affecting the population and the lack of a strong health infrastructure does not bode well for an effective response.
