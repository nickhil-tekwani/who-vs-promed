In the Kostryakovskiy rural district (Fedorovsky district of the Kostanay [Qostanay] region), a quarantine is being established in connection with the detection of anthrax among cattle.

Quarantine will be established on the territory of the village of Spasnoye, follows from the draft decision of the akim of the Kostryakovskiy rural district.

It should be noted a year earlier, in July [2021], anthrax was detected in the Denisovsky district of the Kostanay region, in the village of Prirechnoye. In November [2021], the disease was recorded in one of the farms in the village of Zhaltyrkol, also in the Denisovsky district.

According to the Department of Sanitary and Epidemiological Control of the Kostanay region, as of May this year [2022], 156 stationary unfavorable points for anthrax were registered in the region. These are settlements on the territory of which there are anthrax burials of sick cattle. In total, there are 308 such burials in the region.

The main source of anthrax are sick animals. All products from forcedly slaughtered sick animals are considered infected and unsuitable for human consumption. Even prolonged cooking of meat does not guarantee release from the pathogen. Therefore, dead animals must be disposed of by incineration in incinerators.

[This appears to be a situation which is repeating itself. It seems to have occurred last year [2021] as well.

Late secondary bovine outbreaks are not unexpected and arise from cattle finding bloody soil, which is nice and salty. This is why it is so important to properly dispose of all carcasses in any anthrax outbreak. Cattle are curious beasts and will explore anything that catches their interest.

Kazakhstan has been working hard over the past few decades to control anthrax and has largely succeeded. The present situation is but a fraction of what it was. - Mod.TG
