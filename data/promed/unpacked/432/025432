A fungal disease has infected thousands of apricot trees in lower parts of Chitral, damaging the fruit in its early stage. A farmer said the disease attacked hundreds of trees. The leaves had turned read with holes in them. The disease had attacked a month ago and was spreading fast. [He] said the fungus was widespread this year [2020] unlike the previous years. Solitary trees were less affected [than] those close [to] others.

When contacted, [the] agriculture department said the disease was caused by high humidity due to frequent rainfall, providing congenial environments for the fungus. They asked the farmers to spray unaffected trees with anti-fungus medicines available with the agriculture department, so that spores could be contained as the disease had a high rate of transmission.

[The report above may refer to the fungal coryneum blight, also called apricot shot hole disease (caused by _Stigmina carpophila_, previously genus _Coryneum_). However, there are also other pathogens, including bacteria (_Xanthomonas_, _Pseudomonas_) and viruses (_Prunus necrotic ringspot virus_, PNRSV; _Prune dwarf virus_) that can lead to shot hole symptoms on stone fruit trees like the ones in a photo provided with the story above at the source. Similar symptoms may also be due to insect pests or mechanical damage and hence cannot provide a clear diagnosis. Reliable molecular diagnosis of the pathogen(s) involved will be needed in order to be able to design suitable management strategies for the reported problem.
