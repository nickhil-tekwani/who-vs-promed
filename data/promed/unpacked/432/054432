Tests on a calf at a Borders farm have confirmed the 1st case of cattle scab in Scotland since the early 1980s.

The disease, also known as psoroptic mange, is caused by mites that pierce the animal's skin to feed. It was found on a Scottish Borders farm in a calf recently imported, along with its suckler cow mother, from outside Great Britain. Scotland's Rural College said the disease could have "serious welfare implications" if not treated quickly.

Clusters of cattle scab cases have been found in Wales, southwest England, and Yorkshire, but this is the 1st case in Scotland in about 30 years. The disease is also present in mainland Europe and Ireland.

It is said to have "severe welfare and economic consequences," as it causes severe dermatitis and intense itching. Affected animals inevitably lose weight and, in "extreme cases," death can occur.

Helen Carty, of SAC Consulting veterinary services, said: "Cattle scab is a severe skin disease, with serious welfare implications for cattle if not quickly identified and treated correctly. It has the potential to become established in Scotland because of the movement of animals and the difficulties of treatment. I would urge farmers to remain vigilant for any signs of cattle scab and to notify their vet of any suspect cases."

NFU Scotland President Nigel Miller said it was "imperative" that infected cattle were "locked-down" for transport in order to avoid the parasite becoming an endemic problem. "If it does become endemic, it will affect the status of Scottish cattle and undo the hard work of the industry to establish a reputation for quality within Scottish cattle," he said. "We congratulate the vets that picked up the disease following import and can only hope that prompt detection and follow-up may help limit the repercussions."

The Scottish government urged farmers to "maintain high levels of biosecurity" to prevent the spread of the disease. A spokesman added: "We currently consider that government intervention is not merited and that this is a situation best managed by the industry, but we will continue to monitor the situation and continue to discuss concerns with key organisations."

[Cattle scab is caused by the mite _Psoroptes ovis_; it does not spread to humans. The following Q&A is copied from the web-site of UK's Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA):

Psoroptic mange
---------------
Q. What is psoroptic mange in cattle?

A. This is a parasitic skin disease caused by _Psoroptes_ sp mites.

Q. How to recognise the disease?

A. Clinical signs are more severe in the autumn and winter. The mites cause a severe dermatitis with scab formation along the back, shoulders and tail head of cattle. There is intense pruritis (itching).

Secondary infection is common, leading to bleeding and crusting of the skin. Weight loss can be severe, and deaths can occur if skin lesions are extensive.

In the summer, the mites reduce in number and become less active.

All breeds of cattle can be infected. Cases have mainly been in beef cattle but infection has also been confirmed in a dairy herd.

Buying infected cattle is the most likely way of getting the disease. It can also spread by animal contact at market and in livestock lorries. Disease may be difficult to spot in the early stages or in the summer months when mite numbers are low and clinical signs are minimal.

Q. How to reduce the risk

A. Initially, look for mites to collect using a hand lens. The mites are up to 0.75mm in length and are present all over the lesion, not just at the edge. They appear dark in colour (in contrast to the mites of sheep scab) due to feeding on the blood exudate.

You can collect a skin scrape by using a scalpel blade held at right angles to the skin. Scab material should also be collected. The material should be transported in a container (e.g. a universal screw-cap glass container) to the laboratory.

Direct microscopy is normally sufficient for identification, as there are usually large numbers of mites. A potassium hydroxide digest may be necessary if there are only a few mites.

The _Psoroptes_ sp. mites are oval with pointed mouthparts. All of the legs project beyond the body. The pedicels (at the ends of the 1st, 2nd and 4th pairs of legs in female and 1st, 2nd and 3rd pairs of legs in the male) are jointed and end with funnel-shaped suckers.

Q. Geographical location

A. AHVLA has diagnosed psoroptic mange, caused by _Psoroptes_ sp. mites in cattle in Great Britain. These were the 1st cases seen since the 1980s, and it is probable that the infection had been imported from Europe. There is no link with _Psoroptes ovis_ (sheep scab) cases.

Removal and destruction of the scabs before treatment is also advised.

It is very important to repeat the skin scrapes to check the efficacy of the treatment, as clinical signs may improve, but live mites may still be present.

The treatment should be given to all animals in the group and any in-contact animals. Movement from infected housing should also be advised. Mites can live [apart from] animals and be infective for at least 12 days.

One farm did not respond to either ML or permethrin treatments. In this case, the use of Amitraz ("Taktic" Schering-Plough Intervet), imported from the Republic of Ireland under a special licence from the VMD, appears to be the logical treatment to use. Please see the special import certificate application on the VMD website.

It is essential to ensure effective treatment of this disease. Experience from other European countries has shown that it is possible for psoroptic mange to become the most common skin disease in cattle, with associated severe production losses and welfare concerns.
