An infection of the deadly anthrax disease has been identified in sheep at a farm in Jaszladany, a village 120 km east of Budapest, the agriculture ministry said on Monday [16 Sep 2013].

Authorities found last week that one sheep in a herd of 210 head had died of anthrax, a disease, which can [infect] humans. The farm was placed under quarantine, the ministry said in a statement. "Humans have not gotten the disease yet, so we don't have that problem," said Endre Kardevan, Secretary of State in the ministry, in a video published on the government's website. "We have controlled the situation," he added. "We have surveyed the full livestock of the village, and vaccination has started."

The ministry said the disease would not spread from human to human. It said several sheep died on the farm and their owner buried them under a thin, 40-centimetre layer of earth. The authorities are now disinfecting the [carcasses] and dung and have visited every house in the village to warn residents of the infection that can spread via infected meat.

[The disease is truly sporadic in Hungary. The last reported outbreak in sheep was in 2009 in a limited outbreak (6 cases) in a flock in Jasz-Nagykun-Szolnok, and in cattle in 2010 (one outbreak, Borosod-Abauj-Zemplen, 2 cows affected) and in 2012 (2 outbreaks, location not given, 9 animals affected).

When burying anthrax carcasses, they need to be buried at least 2 meters down to discourage any spores from ever reaching the surface.
