A 28-year-old Vietnamese woman died on Thursday [21 Jun 2007] of bird
flu, Viet Nam's 2nd victim of the H5N1 virus this month, a hospital
official said. "She died early this morning of bird flu because her
condition was too severe," said the official from the National
Institute for Clinical Research of Tropical Diseases in Hanoi where
the woman was treated.
The hospital official, who declined to be identified, said [the
patient], from the northern province of Ha Nam, was admitted 2 weeks
ago and tests showed she was infected with the H5N1 virus. The woman
had not eaten any poultry for 10 days before her infection but her
family raised 16 chickens. Ducks had died for unknown reasons in her
village, according to state media. Her home province of Ha Nam is one
of the 16 provinces and 2 cities that have been hit by the deadly flu
virus since it re-emerged in Viet Nam late last year [2006].
International health experts have described Viet Nam's programme of
poultry vaccination and other measures as a model for keeping the
H5N1 virus at bay since late 2005, but this year [2007] it has spread
nationwide in ducks and chickens.
This week, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung approved an order to import
another batch of 200 million doses of vaccine to battle outbreaks in
poultry.
The Health Ministry had confirmed [the woman's] bird flu test result
and 4 others, including the result of a 20-year old man from the
northern province of Ha Tay, who died on [10 Jun 2007]. The death of
the woman raised Viet Nam's toll since late 2003 to 44 people out of
98 cases reported by health authorities.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has not confirmed the latest cases.

records that the Vietnamese Ministry of Health has confirmed the
occurrence of 4 human cases of bird flu, 2 of whom have now died,
since the reemergence of the disease in 2007. These cases have not
yet been confirmed by WHO. - Mod.CP]
