Bovine TB tests ordered for Presque Isle cattle
-----------------------------------------------
ROGERS CITY, Michigan: State officials are ordering tests for cattle in parts of Michigan's north eastern Lower Peninsula after 3 wild deer were found to have bovine tuberculosis.

The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said on Wednesday that the tests are required for cattle within a 10 mile radius of where each infected deer was killed during last year's hunting season in Presque Isle County, whose county seat is Rogers City.

Experts recently confirmed the deer carried the potentially fatal disease. Federal officials have designated most of the Lower Peninsula as free of bovine TB. A high risk zone remains in Alcona, Alpena, Montmorency, and Oscoda counties. Presque Isle is among 7 counties in a mid-level zone. State veterinarian Dr Steven Halstead says the testing will help Presque Isle avoid being moved to the high risk group.

Bovine tuberculosis has plagued the northern region of the lower peninsula of Michigan for some time. The surveillance on TB has included cervids for quite some time. Surveillance and risk involves both deer and cattle in trying to rid the state of this disease. – Mod.TG]
