Officials are asking locals to be careful with their pets and "backyard wildlife" because of 5 human cases of flea-borne typhus in Tustin [California] in the last year, including a cluster in a southern neighborhood.

"What makes the Tustin case unique is that it is a cluster," said Laura Krueger, assistant vector ecologist for Orange County Vector Control District. "It's the 3rd geographic cluster since the disease entered the county in 2006."

What is flea-borne typhus? A bacterial disease transferred to humans, usually via flea bites. [Its] symptoms begin 1-2 weeks after exposure, [and include] fever, headache, chills, body aches and pains, and rash on chest, back, arms and/or legs. [It] can require hospitalization for meningitis or other respiratory illnesses in more severe cases. Its treatment: antibiotics [e.g., doxycycline].

Prevention: Treat pets regularly with flea-prevention medications; Avoid contact with opossums, rodents, feral (wild or stray) cats and other animals that could have fleas; Seal off openings to attics and crawl spaces (including under trailers and mobile homes) and maintain screens to prevent wild animals from getting access to houses; Report dead opossums, cats or other animals to your local Animal Control agency for removal; Remove or trim overgrown vegetation or ground cover where wild animals might hide or nest; Keep trash cans covered at all times and eliminate outdoor food and water sources including pet food, bird feeders, and fallen fruit from trees.

[Murine typhus, which occurs throughout the world, is a flea-borne rickettsial disease caused by the _Rickettsia typhi_ bacterium. In the USA, murine typhus has been reported in southern Texas, southern California, and Hawaii. We previously reported in 2012 that increasing numbers of cases of murine typhus have occurred each year over the prior 6 years in Orange County, California (ProMED-mail post Murine typhus - USA (02): (CA) 20120601.1153052).

The following is extracted from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Murine typhus - USA: (TX) 20110607.1734:

"Rats are the primary animal reservoir of _R. typhi_; however, other mammals, such as free-ranging cats, dogs, and opossums and their fleas can maintain this microorganism in areas where rats and rat fleas are absent (Azad AF, Radulovic S, Higgins JA, et al: Flea-borne rickettsioses: ecologic considerations. Emerg Infect Dis 1997; 3(3): 319-27; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627639/).

"Humans are usually infected by contact with infected flea feces, either by inoculation into excoriated fleabites, inhalation, or ingestion. Symptoms include fever, headache, chills, vomiting, nausea, myalgias, and rash. The illness usually resolves within 3 weeks, even if untreated. However some patients are sick enough to be hospitalized in an intensive care unit and up to 4 percent of hospitalized patients will die from the infection. Treatment is doxycycline. Prevention is directed at control of flea vectors and animal reservoirs."

The suburban city of Tustin, with a population of 75 540, is located in central Orange County, California, and is surrounded by the city of Santa Ana, which serves as the county seat (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tustin,_California), and Irvine, which is the county's major business and financial hub (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California). Orange County is a county in the US state of California. As of the 2010 census, its population was 3 010 232, making it the 3rd most populous county in California, behind Los Angeles County and San Diego County, and the 6th most populous county in the United States as of 2009 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California). The county is the home of such attractions as Disneyland.
