[1] CDC Health Alert Network update
Date: Thu 20 Dec 2012
Source: CDC Health Alert Network (HAN) [edited]
http://www.bt.cdc.gov/HAN/han00338.asp


New information from diagnostic imaging of patients exposed to contaminated methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) from the New England Compounding Center (NECC) in Framingham, Massachusetts, demonstrates the need for assertive clinical evaluation of these patients for the possibility of an unrecognized, localized spinal or paraspinal infection. This Health Alert Network (HAN) notice provides updated guidance and information about the ongoing multistate outbreak of fungal infections as follows:

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state partners have analyzed new preliminary data based on recent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies among patients who had spinal or paraspinal injection with contaminated MPA from NECC. These findings demonstrate that among patients with no previous evidence of infection, and with new or worsening symptoms at or near the site of their injection, more than 50 per cent had findings suggestive of a localized spinal or paraspinal infection, including epidural abscess, phlegmon, arachnoiditis, discitis, or vertebral osteomyelitis.

This new information suggests that some patients who received spinal or paraspinal injections with implicated MPA from NECC may currently have an unrecognized, localized spinal or paraspinal infection.

CDC is therefore re-emphasizing the guidance from the 20 Nov 2012 HAN advisory notice that recommended clinicians remain vigilant for evidence of fungal infection in these patients and use an assertive approach for clinical management and follow-up of these patients. CDC continues to recommend MRI with contrast of the symptomatic area(s) in patients with new or worsening symptoms at or near their injection site following spinal or paraspinal injection of implicated MPA.

In addition, CDC is recommending that clinicians should consider obtaining an MRI with contrast of the injection site in patients with persistent but baseline symptoms because the presentation of these spinal or paraspinal infections can be subtle and difficult to distinguish from a patient's baseline chronic pain.

On 20 Nov 2012, CDC issued a HAN notification (CDC HAN-00335-2012-11-20-ADV-N; http://emergency.cdc.gov/HAN/han00335.asp) that described preliminary information about epidural abscess and other clinical syndromes diagnosed in patients exposed to implicated MPA from NECC. The HAN advisory notice also noted that CDC has been receiving increasing reports of spinal or paraspinal localized infection (such as epidural abscess, phlegmon, discitis, vertebral osteomyelitis, or arachnoiditis). The notification further recommended that physicians obtain an MRI with contrast of symptomatic area(s) in patients with new or worsening symptoms at or near the injection site.

In the last 2 reporting periods (3-17 Dec 2012), states have reported to CDC a total of 80 new cases, most of which are spinal/paraspinal infections.

Preliminary data on spinal/paraspinal infections
------------------------------------------------
CDC and state health department partners continue to receive data from states about patients under the care of physicians who are acting on CDC's diagnostic recommendations.

In Michigan, Tennessee, and North Carolina, MRI testing was recently done on 128 patients who had no previous evidence of infection and had new or worsening symptoms at or near the site of their spinal or paraspinal injection. Of these, 67 (52 per cent) had findings suggestive of localized infection, including epidural abscess, phlegmon, arachnoiditis, discitis, or vertebral osteomyelitis.

Furthermore, of 109 different patients reporting persistent but baseline symptoms at or near the site of their spinal or paraspinal injection, 15 (14 per cent) also had abnormal MRI findings suggestive of infection. These preliminary data are from a single hospital and may not be generalizable to all exposed patients. An additional 27 (25 per cent) of these patients had non-specific enhancement of soft tissue or other paraspinal structures; the clinical significance of such findings is unclear and may represent either early infection or non-infectious process.

Additional diagnostic guidance
------------------------------
These data suggest that some patients who received spinal or paraspinal injections with implicated MPA from NECC may currently have an unrecognized, localized spinal or paraspinal infection. CDC is therefore re-emphasizing the need for clinicians to remain vigilant for evidence of fungal infection in these patients. Additional guidance for evaluating patients and for obtaining MRI testing is as follows:

Patients:
Patients who have received an epidural injection from one of the 3 implicated lots of MPA1 and who have continued, worsening, or new symptoms at or near the site of their spinal injection should seek evaluation by their medical provider for the possibility of a localized infection such as an epidural abscess. This includes patients who initially received epidural steroid injections for pain and continue to have persistent baseline pain.

Clinicians:
As a part of continued monitoring of patients who received an injection with implicated MPA, clinicians should consider re-evaluating patients for signs and symptoms suggestive of infection, including continued, worsening, or new symptoms at or near the site of their injection.

When deciding whether to obtain an MRI, clinicians should take into account the preliminary data presented above and obtain a careful history of the patient's past and current symptoms.

In general, clinicians should obtain an MRI with contrast of the symptomatic area(s) in patients who received a spinal or paraspinal injection with implicated MPA and have new or worsening symptoms at or near the site of their injection.

Clinicians should consider obtaining an MRI with contrast of the symptomatic area(s) in patients with persistent but baseline symptoms following spinal or paraspinal injection of the implicated MPA because the presentation of these spinal or paraspinal infections can be subtle and difficult to distinguish from a patient's baseline chronic pain.

Clinicians should also consider reviewing MRI results with a neuroradiologist because of potential difficulties in interpreting imaging results for these patients.

CDC's previous Interim Treatment and Diagnostic Guidance for Central Nervous System and Parameningeal Infections Associated with Injection of Contaminated Steroid Products (http://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/clinicians/guidance_cns.html) continues to apply.

In November 2012, CDC established a Clinicians Consultation Network telephone service to assist physicians who are directly involved in the treatment of patients associated with this outbreak and may have clinical questions. To access the Clinicians Consultation Network service, physicians should call 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636). A CDC-INFO agent will verify your role as a healthcare provider and help connect you to the service. Operating hours are the same as those for CDC-INFO, 8:00 am to 8:00 pm Monday through Friday (Eastern Time), except federal holidays.

CDC continues to work with state health departments and others to gather data from existing and newly reported cases of fungal infection. This information will be used to inform updates to existing guidance. Healthcare professionals with patients under their care should check CDC's website (http://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/clinicians/index.html) for the most up-to-date clinical guidance because information is subject to change.

ref: Smith RM, Schaefer MK, Kainer MA, et al: Fungal infections associated with contaminated methylprednisolone injections -- preliminary report. N Engl J Med DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1213978

Abstract
--------
Background
----------
Fungal infections are rare complications of injections for treatment of chronic pain. In September 2012, we initiated an investigation into fungal infections associated with injections of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate that was purchased from a single compounding pharmacy.

Methods
-------
The pharmacy recalled 3 lots of methylprednisolone acetate; examination of unopened vials later revealed fungus. Notification of all persons potentially exposed to implicated methylprednisolone acetate was conducted by federal, state, and local public health officials and by staff at clinical facilities that administered the drug. We collected clinical data on standardized case-report forms, and we tested for the presence of fungi in isolates and specimens by examining cultures and performing polymerase-chain-reaction assays and histopathological and immunohistochemical testing.

Results
-------
As of 19 Oct 2012, more than 99 per cent of 13 534 potentially exposed persons had been contacted. As of 10 Dec 2012, there were 590 reported cases of infection in 19 states, with 37 deaths (6 per cent). As of 26 Nov 2012, laboratory evidence of _Exserohilum rostratum_ was present in specimens from 100 case patients (17 per cent). Additional data were available for 386 case patients (65 per cent); 300 of these patients (78 per cent) had meningitis. Case patients had received a median of 1 injection (range, 1 to 6) of implicated methylprednisolone acetate. The median age of the patients was 64 years (range, 16 to 92), and the median incubation period was 20 days (range, 0 to 120); 33 patients (9 per cent) had a stroke.

Conclusions
-----------
Analysis of preliminary data from a large multistate outbreak of fungal infections showed substantial morbidity and mortality. The infections were associated with injection of a contaminated glucocorticoid medication from a single compounding pharmacy. Rapid public health actions included prompt recall of the implicated product, notification of exposed persons, and early outreach to clinicians.

[CDC is appropriately widening the criteria for MRI scanning looking for spinal or paraspinal abscesses due to _Exserohilum rostratum_.

Table 1 of the study regarding the date of initial symptom onset and presenting syndrome shows that there has been a dramatic decrease in date of initial syndrome from 2 Oct 2012 to 5 Nov 2012 with more of the newer cases being spinal or paraspinal abscesses rather that meningitis.

Table 2 of the study regarding the incubation period from last injection for cases of fungal infections associated with contaminated lots of methylprednisolone acetate shows that except for 16 cases, the incubation period was 48 days or less.

Based on the data presented, which do not count the latest statistics from 17 Dec 2012, the attack rate of CNS and/or joint injection was 590/13 534 or 4.3 per cent. - Mod.LL
