I would like to take this opportunity to clarify some of the points
raised
by Dr. Jon Rosenberg in his 20 Oct 1998 comments on plague reporting.
[Plague, human - USA (Arizona) (04) 981020202037
Regarding the disease, as the Moderator rightly pointed out, the WHO
decision regarding the notification of sporadic cases is based on input
from internationally recognized health experts. Obviously such
notification can only be conducted with the full cooperation of local
health departments.
Dr. Rosenberg asks what advice on plague Health Canada provides to
travellers to the Rockies. Our response to this question is that in
many
instances we do not provide specific advice regarding endemic pathogens,
unless there is some change to indicate that the level of risk for the
traveller has increased. Thus, we would not routinely advise travellers
to
the Rockies regarding their risk for Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever unless
there was some change in risk, e.g., a change from endemic to epidemic.
Based on the evidence to date, we do not feel it is necessary to provide
such travellers with specific information on plague in the Rockies at
the
present time. However, should the situation change, say in a way
comparable to the William Heise County Park situation [see below,
then we would respond accordingly.
Our approach would be to identify the risk, assess
it, and then provide travellers with the appropriate advice. In a
nutshell, the identification of the risk and the assessment of that risk
would be the cornerstone of our response.
As Dr. Rosenberg rightly points out, sporadic cases of a specific
disease
may be expected to occur from time to time in known endemic areas. But
I
think he will agree that a change in the endemic pattern of disease
might
warrant a timely public health response. In fact, this is how we
interpreted the actions of the public health officials in the County of
San
Diego, Department of Health Services, San Diego, California, when in
June
1998 they thought it necessary to warn campers and visitors to the
William
Heise County Park that routine monitoring suggested that chipmunks,
ground
squirrels or other wild rodents in this area might be infected with
plague.
They identified a potential public health risk, assessed it and
implemented
the necessary measures, including warning signs in the Park.
[Plague, wild rodents, warning - USA (California) 980705231736
>From our
perspective these actions justified an appropriate advisory notice to
Canadian travellers who might be visiting the above area, especially
since
Canadians travelling and camping in the US are not aware of, nor do they
expect to encounter, serious infectious diseases. I can assure Dr.
Rosenberg that if a similar situation developed in Canada, then our
response would be similar.
Although human plague is still sporadic in North America, I do not
believe
that we can ignore changing trends and patterns in the wild rodent
reservoir. In turn, this means timely dissemination of information and
appropriate responses by the public health authorities in question.

Subscribers should make an effort to read accurately notes prior to
responding. Dr. Taylor and I never took a position against reporting of
plague cases; we only took exception to criticism for failing to rapidly
report cases.
Local health departments should be afforded some professional
judgement to distinguish between cases of little immediate public health
import beyond the locality, e.g., a sporadic case of plague in an area
well
known to be endemic for plague, and an outbreak of a mosquito-borne
virus.
All reportable diseases should not have to be immediately broadcast
globally
over ProMED-mail.
In California, with a population of over 33 million people, we
have reported annually at least 6000 cases of hepatitis A with numerous
foodborne and community-wide outbreaks, 4000 cases of tuberculosis, 1000
cases of foodborne illness associated with 100 outbreaks, 1000-3000
cases of
viral meningitis, 500 cases of pertussis, 300 cases of invasive
meningococcal infections, 200 cases of malaria, 50 cases of
legionellosis,
30 cases of brucellosis, 30-40 cases of infant botulism, 10-20 cases of
wound botulism, 3-5 cases of foodborne botulism, 3-5 cases of relapsing
fever, and 1-2 cases of human plague, human rabies, hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome, and tularemia, just to highlight some of the 71 categories of
reportable diseases that might be of some interest to ProMED
subscribers.
We would have to dedicate a position to reporting to ProMED just to keep
up
with these. We and our 56 local health jurisdictions try to be
responsible
in our reporting, so forgive us if we are sensitive to criticism that
some
weeks might elapse before we report a case of sporadic human plague to
CDC
or ProMED-mail.

[The comments *were* read carefully. We certainly agree that "All
reportable diseases should not have to be immediately broadcast globally
over ProMED-mail." As for "We would have to dedicate a position to
reporting to ProMED[-mail just to keep up with these," if California
could just report those reportable diseases rapidly to CDC, that would
be good enough for us. We are mainly interested in outbreaks of emerging
infectious diseases and toxins, and therefore the majority of the
impressive list of diseases reported above are not of interest to this
list.
The issue is why individual states do not help the USA fulfil its
obligation under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to report
sporadic cases of plague to WHO within 24 hours.
A subsidiary issue is whether delayed reporting might result in delayed
recognition of a terrorist trial run with plague (the sarin attack in
Tokyo was preceded by at least one trial, and the typhoid incident in
Oregon years ago appeared to be a trial run).
If there is a strong feeling in the USA that there is no hurry to report
such cases, in spite of concerns such as Health CanadaÂ´s (above) and
about bioterrorism, then the US authorities concerned should lobby WHO
to drop the requirement for immediate notification, rather than letting
individual states decide for themselves when they are ready to report.
The proposed revision of the IHR will apparently leave it up to
countries -- but not to their component states or provinces -- to decide
whether or not to report such cases if they unilaterally deem they are
of no international importance. Whether that is a good idea will be
debated at WHO during the coming months - Mod.JW
