[With OIE Alert Message notification, many details are necessarily
left out in order to speed notification. Of course, we will be
interested to learn where the animals or animal products causing the
infection came from as well as details of confirmatory laboratory
tests indicating this an FMD virus type A.
According to the OIE, the last reported outbreak in Turkey was in
2001; FMD serotypes A and O are endemic in Turkey, excluding Thrace,
which has been free for years. An FMD outbreak occurred in Georgia
in 2002. An extensive outbreak of FMD occurred in the region in 1996
affecting Bulgaria, Albania and several parts of the former
