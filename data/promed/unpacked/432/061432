The Canadian Food Inspection Agency lifted a quarantine on four elk farms
Wednesday after six destroyed elk tested negative for chronic wasting disease.
The agency [has also ended a ban on transporting elk in Saskatchewan.
George Luterbach, the agency's program manager of animal health, was cited
as saying it will step up efforts to monitor high-risk farms by increasing
the number of inspections to every six months rather than regular
three-year intervals.
The six animals were destroyed after an animal on an elk farm near Swift
Current, Sask., succumbed to chronic wasting disease in April. All six
animals were related to the affected elk, but their tissue tests came back
negative. Luterbach was quoted as saying the negative results "mean it was
a single isolated incident, but it means ... there is still a lot more
unknowns than knowns in this disease and we will have to continue with a
bit of a modification in our program."

[Time will tell how predictive the Canadian surveillance is but increasing
the frequency of inspection visits cannot do any harm and certainly much
good. I suspect that the actions based on this negative test were more
political than scientific. But subject to the alternative of an indefinite
or long extended farm quarantine there was probably little choice of action
and the vital need to keep the elk farmers' support. - Mod.MHJ
