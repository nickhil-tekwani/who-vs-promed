The Wildlife Rescue Association of British Columbia [Canada] is reporting a salmonella outbreak in pine siskins.

They say increased reports of sick and dying birds have been noted across the Pacific Northwest, from Oregon to British Columbia.

Any bird can be impacted by _Salmonella, however, pine siskins seem to be most vulnerable. This is potentially due to their social nature, flocking, and feeding in close association with each other making it easy for the disease to be passed from bird to bird.

In 2020, 127 pine siskins were admitted, which is a 13-fold increase from what we saw in the last 2 years. In December [2020] alone, 75 pine siskins were admitted and suspected to be infected with _Salmonella_.

Since the New Year began [2121], 36 pine siskins suspected of _Salmonella_ poisoning have been brought in, and more are coming in every day.

Salmonellosis is primarily transmitted by fecal contamination of food and water by sick birds, although it can also be transmitted through bird-to-bird contact. High traffic spots, such as bird feeders, create a source point of transmission and can exacerbate the spread of this deadly disease. Removing the feeders completely is the best solution to encourage birds to disperse, thereby minimizing the potential for infection. If you choose to keep your feeders up, they must be properly maintained to foster a healthy bird environment.

[It would be important to know which strain of _Salmonella_ is implicated, as that determines its zoonotic potential or the risk to domestic animals. A common _Salmonella_ isolated from passerine birds is _S. enterica_ serovar Typhimurium which can cause diarrhea in humans and livestock.

Being gregarious, siskins are particularly susceptible to contagion. For a picture of a pine siskin (_Spinus pinus_) go to https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/67276581-720px.jpg. - Mod.PMB
