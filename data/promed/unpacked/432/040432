Biologists have determined that a virus was responsible for killing large numbers of fish at Brookville Lake this fall [2012], according to an Indiana Department of Natural Resources [DNR] release.

Hundreds or even thousands of the lake's common carp died this year, biologists said.

The koi herpesvirus -- known as KHV -- showed up in examinations of carp that were collected from the lake and sent to the Purdue University Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory for testing, the release stated. KHV affects common carp and koi, which is a carp species commonly stocked in ornamental ponds and widespread in the aquaculture industry.

Related species such as goldfish and grass carp can be carriers of the virus, the release stated, and transmit it to susceptible fish even though those carrier species do not appear to be affected by it.

There is no evidence that KHV affects native minnows or Asian carp, the release stated, and it poses no human health risk.

Reports of sick and dying carp at Brookville Lake were first reported to DNR in mid-September [2012]. KHV was first found in Indiana in 2011 and has been blamed for fish kills in the St Joseph River in Elkhart County and at a private lake in Daviess County.

The long-term impacts of KHV on fisheries at Brookville Lake and elsewhere around the state are unknown, the release stated, but KHV is present throughout Indiana and is likely to cause additional fish kills.

[Koi herpesvirus disease (KHD) in common carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) has been reported throughout the world. The disease is transmitted by fish-to-fish contact and it is also possible that the disease can spread through contaminated water, nets, and other equipment. As other herpesviruses, KHD has the capacity to remain latent in the infected fish and become activated and cause disease when some stressors trigger it.

More information on KHD is found in OIE's Aquatic Manual (2009 update) chapter 2.3.6, available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/2010/2.3.06_KHVD.pdf. - Mod.PMB
