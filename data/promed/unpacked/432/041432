A total of 8 people have been infected with anthrax after coming in contact with the meat of a sick cow at Sreerampur village in Modonpur union of Kalukhali upazila under Rajbari on [Wed 30 Aug 2017], said officials of Rajbari General Hospital.

"We bought a sick cow from my uncle on [Wed 30 Aug 2017]. Later we slaughtered it and distributed the meat. Afterwards, I saw some sore marks on my hand," said IM, an infected villager. "I took treatment locally but did not find any result. Then I went to Rajbari General Hospital on [Mon 4 Sep 2017]. There doctors told me that I have been infected with anthrax," he said.

As many as 7 other people, who handled the meat of the sick cow, fell sick with similar problems, villagers said.

"Eight people came to us to take treatment for anthrax. All the patients are being provided treatment at the hospital while a medical team has been kept alert at the village to identify if there are more patients," said Dr Sunil Kumar Roy, resident medical officer of Rajbari General Hospital. These people got infected with anthrax after coming in contact with the meat, he said.

Rajbari Livestock Officer Abu Bakar Siddik said, "People engaged in the meat processing were infected with anthrax. I have visited the area and we are taking necessary steps about it."

[For a map of Bangladesh go to http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/asia/political-map-of-Bangladesh.gif. For a description of Rajhbari, go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajbari_District which is in Dhaka Division at the junction of the Ganges & Jamuna rivers. It is not far from the previous outbreak in Khulna.

As I have written before, telling folk to not slaughter and butcher sick cattle is as effective as a public policy of sexual abstinence. Folk hear but they don't listen. Bangladesh is overdue for a livestock anthrax control and surveillance proactive programme, especially in the provinces with repeated outbreaks. Such are cost effective and, if nothing else, it effectively prevents human cases of anthrax which are expensive when the affected end up in hospital. - Mod.MHJ]
