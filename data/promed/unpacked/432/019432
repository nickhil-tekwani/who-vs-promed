This report comes from Vanga Hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(former Zaire) where two cases of encephalopathy of undetermined etiology
presented this week at this 400 bed mission hospital located in the
interior of the Republic of Congo 80 kilometers upriver from Kikwit.
Two school age children from different villages in the Vanga Health
District (5-7 kilometers apart) presented to the reference hospital with
symptoms consistent with a viral gastroenteritis. Both evolved rapidly
into a coma. The first child died within 48 hours, the second is at present
still comatose. The children attended different schools and secured water
and food from different sources. No family members to date have contracted
this illness.
The cases are as follows:
Patient 1 (hospitalized 12/18/97)
The first patient, an eight year old boy from the village Songo, 6 km from
Vanga fell ill on a Friday after school and died 2 days later on Sunday
evening. The child in otherwise good health had been seen at Vanga
Hospital five days earlier for a sprained ankle sustained while playing
soccer. He was given aspirin and an ace bandage. On the first day of his
illness he experienced colicky abdominal pain with persistent vomiting. He
was treated locally with chloramphenicol and an anti-spasmodic
(papaverine). The following day he was referred to the Vanga Hospital
where clinical exam by a physician suggested viral gastroenteritis in an
otherwise healthy child. He was afebrile, a malaria smear was negative and
white blood count was 12,150mm3. The child was hospitalized for
observation. Chloramphenicol and an antispasmodic were continued.
Early the following morning the night nurse found the boy in a deep coma
and signaled the physician on call. The child was febrile (38 C) with
tachycardia (120) and tachypnea (48). He was unresponsive to all stimuli.
Pupils were dilated and responsive to light. Diffuse hypotonia and
hyporeflexia were noted. Babinski test was negative. Lungs were clear and
heart sounds normal. The liver edge was smooth and palpated 3cm below the
costal margin; spleen was not enlarged. No icterus was noted. Urine was
negative for bilirubin. A spinal tap revealed 2 white cells and 408 red
cells, no trypanosomes were found on a centrifuged specimen. Malaria smear
again was negative. A blood sugar was 97. An anticholinesterase agent
(neostigmine) was given without effect. The child was started empirically
on intravenous quinine and dextrose. He remained in a coma and died later
that day.
Patient 2 (hospitalized 12/26/97)
The second child, a six-year-old girl from the village of Bilili, 11 km
from Vanga developed a low grade fever, abdominal pain and vomiting 5 days
prior to her presentation to this hospital. She was treated at a local
clinic with Bactrim and aspirin and referred to the Vanga hospital when her
symptoms persisted. She walked into the outpatient clinic at Vanga on a
Saturday afternoon and the following day, today is in a coma.
The child was evaluated by a physician upon entry and felt to have mild
gastroenteritis but otherwise in good health. She was afebrile and had
subtle rales in her right lung base, though no cough or dyspnea were noted.
Her malaria smear was negative, white count 6,800 mm3 and stool sample was
negative for leukocytes and parasites. She too was hospitalized under
observation and started on oral rehydration fluids and ampicillin.
During the evening she had persistent vomiting and became combative.
Clinical exam by the same physician in the morning revealed her to be in a
coma, minimally responsive to noxious stimuli. She was afebrile with heart
rate 90 and respiratory rate 30. Pupils were again dilated and responsive
to light. She had diffuse hypertonia though a negative Babinski. No
seizure activity was noted. Rales were now noted along both bases and an
S3 gallop was appreciated. Liver and spleen were mildly enlarged. A spinal
tap was negative with 1 white cell, 3 reds and no evidence of trypanosomes.
Repeat malaria was negative. White count was now 15,900 with 85% polys
and 15% lymphocytes (no eosinophils noted). Sedimentation rate was 103mm
(elevated for our lab). The child was given furosemide with resolution of
her rales and diminution of tachypnea. Quinine and dextrose were given
I.V. Later in the day the child became diffusely hypotonic and
unresponsive to all stimuli . As of this report, the child is still
comatose.
Public Health teams will travel tomorrow to these villages to interview
family members and school mates. Similar cases (if any), treated in the
local dispensary will be identified.
Blood has been obtained from the second child and the serum separated and
frozen. These are available to an interested collaborator, although
arrangements need to be made with the State Department and then the U.S.
Embassy in Kinshasa for exportation. The samples can be sent frozen by
Missionary Aviation Flights from Vanga to Kinshasa.
We will advise ProMED-mail of future cases. We welcome comments from
ProMED-mail subscribers and similar experiences by physicians as we try and
identify the etiology of this apparent rapid onset encephalopathy in two
school age children in our health district in the DRC, Central Africa.
