As medical scientists we are concerned that what is currently determined to
be an increase in _Giardia_ and _Cryptosporidium_ has been suggested
environmentally without any support from clinical data. The health
department is currently conducting a survey of the regional labs to
determine if there is any correlation clinically and so far our
understanding is that there is none. Only a few cases of _Campylobacter_
[infection have been reported.
We are unaware of the current standards and posed the question, are there
any environmental standards that equate to increases in clinical cases. If
you have any we would appreciate a copy.

[Apparently a recent health department check of the Sidney pathology
laboratories has not noted any increases in infections with these parasites
and in fact the reports are lower than in past years. There is a
discordance between the disease surveillance and the water quality data.
Further, with the introduction of new testing techniques such as flow
cytometry, which are more sensitive than previous techniques used, new
standards or guidelines may have to be determined to reflect the level of
contamination required to cause an increased incidence with these parasites
in the community. An interesting situation when one is looking down the
barrel of the next Olympics. - Mod.MHJ
