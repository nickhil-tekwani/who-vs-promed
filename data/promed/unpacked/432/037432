TRICHINELLOSIS, IMPORTED - UK EX SERBIA

An outbreak of 8 cases of trichinellosis has arisen among Yugoslavian
immigrants in west London and in the county of Hertfordshire. The outbreak
has been traced to the town of Sombor in northern Serbia (former
Yugoslavia) where between 40 and 80 cases are believed to have resulted
from eating infected salami made from pork.
This salami is a regional delicacy often eaten at this time of year. Nine
salamis were brought into the United Kingdom from Sombor on 22 November
1999, distributed as gifts between 4 households, and eaten by at least 8
people towards the end of November. At least 5 of the 8 developed classical
features of trichinellosis towards the end of December, including fever,
myalgia, peripheral and periorbital oedema, rash, and myocardial
infiltration. Five cases were treated with either albendazole or
thiabendazole. Symptoms of systemic trichinellosis typically occur 3 weeks
after eating infected meat, which coincides with the phase of larval
migration.
The diagnosis has been made on clinical signs and symptoms. Serological
tests are being conducted by the parasitology laboratory at University
College London (UCL), which (along with UCL's histology department) is also
examining leftover pork for trichinella larvae.
Cases may arise elsewhere, and should prompt enquiries about exposure to
smoked meat, especially pork, imported from countries of the former
Yugoslavia.
Two outbreaks of trichinellosis occurred in the German state of
Northrhine-Westfalia between November 1998 and January 1999, one associated
with ground meat (including pork) and the other with a commercially
prepared raw smoked sausage (1). The original source of the meat could not
be traced: the retailer was part of a chain supplied by abattoirs in
several European countries, in turn supplied by about 40 producers (1).
The problem of tracing contaminated meat to its source has also arisen in
association with recent outbreaks of trichinellosis linked to consumption
of horse meat (2,3).
