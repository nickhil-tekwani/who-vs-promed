A couple from Allegan County hopes their experience with a rare and deadly mosquito-borne illness serves as a lesson for others.

RF was rushed to the emergency room 30 Aug [2018] after a few weeks of flu-like symptoms. It was another 2 weeks of testing, memory loss, and partial paralysis before he was diagnosed with eastern equine encephalitis.

"They started leaning towards the West Nile virus," his wife, KF, explained to 24 Hour News 8 Wednesday [17 Oct 2018]. "So we kept thinking it's the West Nile virus; we know where we're going now. But it came back negative."

RF's Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) diagnosis is the 1st confirmed case in Michigan since 2016. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the illness has a 33 percent fatality rate, making it one of the most dangerous illnesses that can be contracted via a mosquito bite.

"I've been married to him 28 years. I've seen him go through a lot of being sick and stuff, but this here was like I'm losing him," KF said.

Despite the odds, her husband has already made great strides in his recovery and is now in a Kalamazoo rehabilitation facility. The facility cited federal health privacy laws when 24 Hour News 8 requested access to Force's room for the interview, so instead, the couple met with 24 Hour News 8 off-site Wednesday afternoon [17 Oct 2018].

The couple spoke highly of the staff working with him. "They have me working a lot here, have me doing that motions," RF explained as he lifted his right arm above his head. "I'm in a wheelchair. I can't walk great yet. Apparently, I had a major stroke in the process of all of this, so I still have a long way to go, probably another 9 months to a year."

His speech is somewhat difficult to understand, but both the of them are committed to his recovery. They also hope the scary diagnosis will remind others to be careful.

"We want him to be able to come home and make a full recovery at home," KF said. "Use the bug sprays. All it took was one mosquito, and if one person can get it, another person can get it, and maybe the next person won't survive."

The couple is working with an advocate to navigate the insurance process. As of now, RF's medical bills amount to USD 350 000 and will continue to climb. They're looking into setting up a GoFundMe page but did not have one created as of this evening [Wed 17 Oct 2018].

[This is the same case posted on 8 Sep 2018, with more details of the patient's convalescence (see Eastern equine encephalitis - USA (23): (MI) 20180919.6037655). The patient is fortunate to have survived his eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) infection, although his neurological sequelae are not unusual in those who do survive.

As noted before, this has been an active year for transmission of EEEV in the eastern USA. This is the 1st human EEE case reported in Michigan this year (2018). Interestingly, no equine cases have been reported in the state this year (2018), although there was one in the neighboring state of Wisconsin.

Human EEE cases are very rare. Only a few cases are reported by CDC each year, occurring in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast states and very rarely in the Upper Midwest. Most cases of EEEV infection in humans are inapparent or mild with only 4.5 percent of cases severe. Severe cases occur most frequently in people under 15 and over 50 years of age. There is a 33 percent case fatality rate in severe cases, and survivors often have brain damage. There is no commercially available human vaccine, so avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure.
