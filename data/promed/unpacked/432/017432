The Ministry of Health of Cordoba have reported 12 cases of trichinosis in 2 towns of the province, prompting a warning about the risks of consuming or buying pork of doubtful origin or without the corresponding sanitary inspection.

In the town of El Tio, 11 cases were reported, whose source of infection identified is the consumption of home-made pork products. The remaining case is domiciled in Santa Ana, unrelated to the previous cases and for which the source of infection is still under investigation.

Trichinosis is a parasitic disease caused most commonly by the roundworm _Trichinella spiralis_. If someone ingests undercooked or raw meat with the encysted larvae, the stomach acid releases the larvae which mature to adults in the intestine.

What preventive measures are available?
- Cook all fresh pork, pork products and meat from wild animals to where all the meat reaches 70 deg C (158 deg F). The meat should turn from pink to gray.
- Freezing pork at -25 deg C (-13 deg F) for at least 10 days will kill the cysts. The exception to this rule is strains of _Trichinella_ found in walrus and bear meat that are cold-resistant and must be cooked as noted above.
- Smoking, salting or drying meat is not effective.
