Foot and mouth disease, Chinese Taipei
--------------------------------------
Information received on 25 Jun 2010 from Dr Kwo-Ching Huang, Chief
Veterinary Officer and Deputy Director General, Bureau of Animal and
Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine Council of agriculture,
Executive Yuan, Taipei, Chinese Taipei

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Start date 22 Jun 2010
Date of 1st confirmation of the event 25 Jun 2010
Report date 25 Jun 2010
Date submitted to OIE 25 Jun 2010
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence 25 Feb 2010
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Foot and mouth disease virus
Serotype: Pending
Nature of diagnosis: Clinical, Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 Baozhong Township, Yun-Lin
Date of start of the outbreak 22 Jun 2010
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Species Swine
Susceptible 1296
Cases 112
Deaths 0
Destroyed 163
Slaughtered 0

Epidemiology - Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection.
Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: During the routine active surveillance in
the livestock markets, a pig was found NSP antibody positive. The
prefecture animal disease control competent authority traced back to
the farm of origin. The clinical investigation showed that 112 pigs
on the farm had healed vesicular lesions. The prefecture animal
disease control competent authority immediately destroyed the 163
pigs (included the pigs other than the 112 pigs in the same pen).
Cleaning and disinfection were implemented in the index farm.

Samples for serological tests and virus isolation were collected and
sent to the National Laboratory (Animal Health Research Institute).
The laboratory confirmed 6 positive results for NSP and all negative
for RT-PCR. Further tests are ongoing. A total of 16 farms within
1-km radius of the index farm have been under vigilant monitoring and
no clinical or epidemiological evidence of infection has been found.

Control measures - Measures applied. Quarantine; Movement control
inside the country; Screening; Zoning; Disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s); Modified stamping out; No vaccination; No
treatment of affected animals.

Measures to be applied - No other measures

Laboratory name and type: Animal Health Research Institute (National
laboratory)
Species Swine
Test Non-structural protein ELISA
Test date 25 Jun 2010
Result Positive

Species Swine
Test reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
Test date 25 Jun 2010
Result Negative

Future Reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[There are multiple reasons for concern. First and foremost, the
tremendous animal loss and economic damage caused by the 1997
outbreak resulting in almost 3.8 million dead swine and almost USD 7
billion dollar negative economic impacts, including the ongoing loss
of the Japanese market. So, there is a devastating history to FMD in Taiwan.

Secondly, since 2009 there have been isolated but persistent reports
of FMD in Taiwan, sometimes with clinical signs and sometimes based
only on laboratory findings. These are reported in OIE/WAHID database
as confirmed cases without clinical signs. Furthermore, 6 pigs were
found in February of 2010, in Penghu island, at the slaughterhouse
with clinical signs. The present outbreak investigation indicates
that the disease was picked up serologically at a livestock market.
And, unfortunately, there was evidence of clinical disease as
indicated by healed vesicular lesions in the 112 pigs most closely
associated with the FMD animal at the farm of origin.

Finally, there is a great deal activity with FMD serotype O problems
in Asia recently, most prominently feature in South Korea, Japan and
China -- see references below. Mongolia and Kazakhstan have recently
experienced FMD serotype O as well. It would not be surprising to
find this outbreak in Taiwan to also be a serotype O outbreak and it
is absolutely essential that sequencing results from all these
outbreaks be compared to ascertain if there is a singular identity to
the FMD circulating in Asia presently and if this outbreak in Taiwan
represents an extension of range. - Mod.PC]
