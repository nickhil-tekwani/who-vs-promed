Henry M Feder, Jr, M.D, Sam Telford, III, Sc.D, Heidi K Goethert, Sc.D, Gary P Wormser, M.D. Powassan Virus Encephalitis Following Brief Attachment of Connecticut Deer Ticks.

Abstract
Background
Powassan virus (POWV) is a tick-transmitted pathogen that may cause severe encephalitis; experimentally, it can be transmitted within just 15 minutes following a tick bite. The deer tick virus subtype of POWV (DTV) is transmitted by the deer tick [blacklegged tick] and is the likely cause of the increase in the number of POWV cases reported in the U.S. However, DTV has only been definitively documented in 6 patients by molecular analysis of the virus.

Methods
There were 2 patients from Connecticut with encephalitis, who had a recent deer tick bite, who were evaluated by the relevant serologic tests to determine if they had been infected with POWV. Evaluation also included molecular testing of an adult deer tick that had been removed from one of the patients.

Results
We documented neuroinvasive POWV infection in 2 children from Connecticut. Based on the results of testing the tick removed from case 2, this patient was infected by DTV, representing the 7th reported case and the 1st documented case of DTV infection in a child. Of note, the duration of the tick bites in both cases was very short.

Conclusion
We provide the 1st clinical and epidemiologic evidence that POWV/DTV can be rapidly transmitted to a human host, i.e., within hours of tick attachment, which is distinctive when compared to other deer tick transmitted infections such as Lyme disease.

[The important point of this report is that POWV can be rapidly transmitted to humans a short time following the bite of infected deer ticks (blacklegged ticks, _Ixodes scapularis_). In areas where this tick is common, inspection for the presence of this tick and their swift removal are important.

Cases of Powassan virus infection have been reported every year in recent years from one or more of the eastern and northeastern or midwestern states of the USA including Connecticut. Last year (2019), 8 cases of POW virus infection were reported to the CDC (see https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/statistics.html).

Ticks become infected when they feed on groundhogs, squirrels, mice, or other rodents that have the virus in their blood. Infected ticks can then spread POW virus to people and other animals by biting them. People do not develop high enough levels of the virus in their blood to infect biting ticks. As a result, people are considered "dead-end" hosts for Powassan virus. There is no vaccine for POW virus, so avoidance of tick bites is the only preventive measure. - Mod.TY
