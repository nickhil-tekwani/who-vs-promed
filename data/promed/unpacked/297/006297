-----------------------------------------------------------
While I appreciate the moderator PMB's comments on the problematic aspects of euthanasia as an approach to disease control and while I agree that culling certainly shouldn't be considered a general approach to control of epizootic bighorn sheep pneumonia, it's my understanding that the difficult decision to implement the culling strategy was made in direct response to specific circumstances unique to the Tieton epizootic.

These are:
1. That the outbreak had already resulted in the deaths of the majority of the Tieton bighorn sheep population, perhaps a large majority, and therefore the cull represented a relatively small number of animals.

2. That surviving very sick animals in the affected Tieton populations were lingering near the Yakima River that separates this bighorn sheep population from the adjacent Clemans Mountain population (in which helicopter observations showed no evidence of either reduced numbers of live bighorn sheep or signs of pneumonic disease (lethargy, coughing, etc.)

The surviving affected Tieton population animals, particularly those directly adjacent to Clemans Mountain range, were deemed to represent a high risk of disease transmission to the still (apparently) unaffected Clemans Mountain herd and reduction of this risk was the primary consideration in implementing the euthanasia policy. Whether the policy succeeds in ameliorating this risk is by no means a sure thing, and won't be clear until the health of the Clemans Mountain bighorn sheep population health can be followed over the coming years.

Therefore, the strategy was not to selectively cull infected individuals across the animal's range (as in the Tasmanian devil example cited by the moderator) but rather to prevent, if possible, contact between acutely ill surviving Tieton animals and animals in a directly adjacent, unaffected bighorn sheep population. While more generally adaptive management and consideration of a broad array of options is certainly appropriate, given local experiences with this disease it was felt that working quickly to attempt to protect the directly adjacent herd was paramount.

Regarding the moderator's comments about the multifactorial, multiple pathogen nature of bighorn sheep pneumonia: recent evidence, at least in the northwestern US, in fact suggests the existence of a single necessary pathogen, _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_, underlying epizootic bighorn sheep pneumonia:

- _M. ovipneumoniae_ infection has been detected in all 44 bighorn sheep necropsied to date in the Tieton epizootic. All isolates from this outbreak tested to date (N=9) exhibited an identical 16S-23S ITS DNA sequence, consistent with transmission of a single epizootic strain.

- This same pattern of infection has been observed in all 8 other recent epizootics in which appropriate diagnostics were performed (Besser TE et al, EID 2012; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3309594/).

- In contrast, a large majority of healthy bighorn sheep populations, like the Tieton population prior to this disease event, test negative for _M. ovipneumoniae_ both serologically and by culture/PCR (Besser TE et al., Prev Vet Med 2012; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23253148).

These and related observations are consistent with the hypothesis that _M. ovipneumoniae_ is an exotic disease agent for North American wild sheep species with the potential to trigger pneumonia epizootics of considerable severity and sometimes prolonged duration (that is, annual recurrent lamb pneumonia) when introduced into susceptible populations.

[Special thanks to Dr Besser for the fine clarification offered. If _M. ovipneumoniae_ arises as the most parsimonious explanation for the disease, it does make sense to take cautionary action and protect the neighboring population by culling.

I cannot resist asking, however, what if all bighorn sheep will eventually be exposed to _M. ovipneumoniae_? Does not culling prevent the natural selection of a resistant population or the establishment of herd immunity? What if the culled individuals were the resistant ones that would re-populate Tieton? - Mod.PMB
