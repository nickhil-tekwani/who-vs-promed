Saskatchewan's Ministry of Health is urging residents to take
precautions after a recent death from hantavirus in the west-central
part of the province. Few details about the death are being released,
but the Ministry is advising caution to avoid infection with
hantavirus when cleaning up rodent infested barns, homes or other
buildings. "We advise people to take precautions against hantavirus
[infection] by avoiding contact with deer mice to every extent
possible," said deputy chief medical officer Dr Saqib.

Although hantavirus infection is rare, it is a potentially fatal
illness. Since 1994, 21 cases have been reported in Saskatchewan,
including 4 in 2003 and one each in 2008 and 2010.

[The rodent reservoir host involved is the deer mouse, _Peromyscus
maniculatus_. The hantavirus involved in the current case is not
specified, but may be Sin Nombre virus. The white-footed mouse, _P.
leucopis_, also occurs in Saskatchewan, in the southernmost part of
the province.

It is important to note that there is an increase nationally in cases
of hantavirus [infection]. Currently, there are 50 registered
infections, a figure higher than the median of the last 5 years which
is 32 cases. This is different from Maule, where to date there are 5
cases -- with a case fatality rate of 20 per cent and during the same
period in 2010, there were 8. None-the-less, it is always important to
reinforce messages about prevention.

"The message that we are sending to the populace is that they adopt a
series of simple actions in the countryside, while camping or on
trips, that that can be taken to avoid contracting [infection] by this
virus, such as ventilating cabins, treating floors with bleach,
keeping garbage in closed containers, avoiding collections of wild
fruit, utilizing tents with floors and that can be closed and without
tares, keeping food materials in closed, [rodent] resistant
containers, avoiding areas with pastures, and, above all, avoiding
contact with wild rats and long-tailed pygmy rice rats," said health
SEREMI [Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud; government district
administrator] Hans Lungenstrass.

A man, apparently affected by [a] hantavirus [infection], was taken
from Chaiten to the emergency [unit] of the Puerto Montt Base
Hospital. the patient is a 33 year old man who on Sunday night [25 Sep
2011] was taken from the La Junta area of Chaiten to Puerto Montt
after his hantavirus rapid test was positive.

The man worked in the Los Cisnes community of the La Junta area
previous to 18 Sep [2011] doing tasks in a sawmill 13 km [8 mi] from
the El Amarillo locale in Palena province. During that time, the
patient presented with the 1st symptoms and went to the Futaleufu
Hospital, where the rapid test was done that was positive for
hantaviruses. The Puerto Montt Base Hospital reported that the patient
presented with fever, myalgia, and respiratory complications. However,
despite his serious condition he is stable and out of risk of death.

Statistically, the case corresponds to the Aysen Region and the health
authorities are awaiting the [test] results from the Institute for
Public Health in Santiago to confirm [the diagnosis] of the disease.

We note that the area in the Palena province continues on early,
preventive alert due to the presence of rodents because of the quila
flowering [a perennial bamboo that grows in the humid temperate
forests of Chile and Argentina - Mod.TY] that has caused explosive
reproduction of these mammals [rodents].

The Institute of Public Health today [19 Oct 2011] corroborated 2
hantavirus infections in Bio-Bio province. That brings to 9 registered
cases up to now in the region, 6 of them fatal.

Information from La Radio stated that [the cases] were a 36 year old
woman and a 38 year old man from the Negrette community, where
presumably she was infected while cleaning storage buildings and [he]
canals, respectively, without an epidemiological connection.

Both [patients] were sent to the Los Angeles base Hospital where they
remain in stable condition and have overcome the most critical phase
[of the infection] with a better prognosis, according to information
from the health SEREMI [Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud;
government administrative agency]. Luis Hormazabal, in charge of
zoonoses of the health agency, that professionals of this division are
working on the ground to determine the [epidemiological] details of
the infection.

It is worth mentioning that up until now there are 11 confirmed
hantavirus [infection] cases in the region, of which 4 are from
Bio-Bio province. A total of 6 people have died in the area due to
transmission due to this virus transmitted by wild mice.

A 73 year old man from the Pirhuieco frontier locale in Panguipuilli
is currently interned in the intensive care unit of the Neuquen
hospital in Argentina, suspected of having [a] hantavirus infection.
The man was 1st attended to in the San Martin de los Andes medical
center and later taken to Junin and now is located in the intensive
care unit (ICU) in Neuquen. Related tests have been made to determine
the cause of his situation; results are expected within the next 7
days.

The patient cannot be transported to a medical enter in Chile because
the Hua Hum ferry to Panguipuli is under repairs so that the
connection between Pirihueico and Puerto Fey are difficult. [Hua Hum
is an international mountain pass in the Andes and the only connection
here between Chile and Argentina is by ferry across the lake. -

The health SEREMI [Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud;
governmental administrative unit] is on alert and stated that if other
suspected [hantavirus infection] symptomatic cases present themselves,
they will be sent to Argentina.

The director of epidemiology in the province, Alberto Gentile, stated
yesterday [11 Oct 2011] that a 7 year old girl had been admitted to
the Vicente de Paul Hospital in Oran on Friday [7 Oct 2011] with a
febrile picture that appeared to be [a] hantavirus [infection].
Preliminary tests by the Tropical Medicine Research Laboratory led to
a suspicion of a dengue [clinical] picture.

After confirmation [of a hantavirus infection], it was supposed
[learnt? - Mod.SH] that the girl and her family lives a house near
sugar cane plantations, "a place where there usually are rodent
species that are reservoirs of hanta[viruses]," mentioned the
epidemiologist.

In the 9 months of this year [2011], the number of confirmed
hantavirus cases in the province totals 17. During 2010, there were 30
and in 2009 there were 29.

[The hantavirus most likely involved in this case is Oran virus.
However, without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say
with certainty which hantavirus was involved. As noted in ProMED-mail
archive number 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been
associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western
Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central
Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in
the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in north western
Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in
_O. flavescens_) virus.

During 2011, hantavirus[es] have caused the deaths of 4 people who got
this rare but extremely serious disease, caused by a family of viruses
that are transmitted to humans when they breathe air contaminated with
urine, excrement, or saliva of rodents, according to a statement from
the local unit with national responsibility for influenza and
hantaviruses of the Ministry of Health, Adolfo Zarate.

According to reports from the Ministry of Health, they have 101
recorded suspicious [hantavirus infection] cases, 19 of which are
confirmed by departmental laboratories in Santa Cruz, Cochabamba,
Tarija, and Beni departments [state or province equivalents].

"As a ministry, we are taking measures necessary to avoid an increase
in cases. We are equipped with informative material and materials to
control rodents in the areas were there are these vectors [reservoirs]
that transmit the disease," explained Zarate.

The commonest symptoms of the disease are muscle pain, headache,
coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Zarate stated that
the primary symptom of the disease is respiratory difficulty caused by
the accumulation of fluids in the lungs, a situation that can lead to
respiratory arrest. Currently, there is no specific treatment for
hantavirus [pulmonary] disease. Early intensive hospital care is the
only known measure.

[The specific locations of these cases is not given in this report,
other than the departments where the laboratories have made the
diagnosis and presumably where these cases occurred. The specific
hantaviruses involved in these cases is not mentioned either.

The possible hantaviruses (and their rodent hosts, from a list kindly
provided by Dr Jim Mills, and their images) that might be involved in
these HPS cases are:

- Laguna Negra virus (_Calomys laucha_
