Dengue fever kills 73 in Philippines in 1st half [of 2005]
-----------------------------------------------
The mosquito-born dengue epidemic disease has killed 73 people and
infected 5323 others in the 1st 6 months of this year [2005] in the
Philippines, the local newspaper Philippine Daily Inquirer reported
on Saturday [30 Jul 2005].
The Department of Health National Epidemiology Center recorded at
least 5396 cases of dengue, 41 percent higher than during the same
period last year [2004]. Among the infected people, 73 have died
[case fatality rate of 1353 per 100 000 for the 1st half of 2005,
nationwide. - Mod.RY], said the report.
The report quoted Dr. Vito Roque Jr., chief of the center's
surveillance unit, as saying that the number of dengue cases was not
expected to drop until November or December [2005], when dengue is
fully contained.
Outbreaks of dengue have been reported recently in Bulacan, north of
Manila, and some other places, according to the report.
At least 117 children have been infected recently with the disease in
Nueva Ecija province, some 150 km north of Manila, said the report.

Dengue outbreak downs at least 250 in Nueva Ecija, hardest-hit town
declared under state of emergency
-----------------------------------------------
A state of emergency has been declared in this town by local
officials, following a severe dengue fever outbreak that has claimed
the lives of 3 children and downed [infected] at least 117 other
persons. A 4th fatality was reported in Cuyapo town.
Dr. Benjamin Lopez, provincial health officer, had recorded between
250 and 300 dengue cases as of last Thursday [21 Jul 2005]. The cases
were reported to him by the various city and town health officers.
Doctor Lopez reported that, to date, at least 27 towns and 3 of the 5
cities of Nueva Ecija were affected by the mosquito-borne dengue
fever, with at least 250 reported cases. This town alone had 117
reported cases as of last Friday [22 Jul 2005].
Meanwhile, Mayor Isidro T. Pajarillaga allayed widespread fears that
the dengue fever outbreak in this town has gone out of control.
Pajarillaga said that he ordered, as far back as last February
[2005], fogging operations in all the barangays of the town, adding
that he has likewise ordered a repeat of the fogging operations every
Saturday in a bid to avert the spread of the disease.
The mayor said he recently discovered the other day that several
creeks and waterways in the town proper have been clogged by decaying
logs that were swept along by the series of typhoons last year
[2004]. He blamed some residents for the situation, saying that they
had been disposing of their garbage indiscriminately in places such
as canals and vacant lots, the reason why, at the onset of the rainy
season, the waterways were clogged and stagnant.
In a related development, some residents were alarmed by the reported
depletion of the PHP 2 million [USD 35 800] calamity fund at a time
when it is critically needed. Also, the residents have demanded the
presence of their mayor in the town to assist them in the emergency
situation.
In this regard, Pajarillaga said that he was in Manila recently to
follow up on the town's request to some congressmen and senators for
funding of the town's health programs, drainage projects and school
facilities. A request for assistance by a barangay captain for the
use of the town's ambulance was not granted due to lack of funds,
Pajarillaga said.

A 10-fold increase in dengue cases within the last 10 years is
worrying the government, prompting it to order all relevant
government agencies to take measures to halt the upward trend.
This should result in closer monitoring, greater enforcement,
enhancement of prevention measures, and better public education in
schools.
A nationwide campaign to clean up schools will be launched in
September [2005] to encourage full participation from students and
teachers to ensure that their schools are _Aedes_-free.
Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Najib Razak said the current
statistics showed that 156.1 out of 100 000 people had dengue, up
from 132.5 out of 100 000 people last year [2004]. "Last year, over
33 000 people were hospitalized with dengue, and the upward trend is
continuing this year. "In the last decade, 599 people had died of
dengue, and this is worrying," he told reporters after chairing the
Cabinet Committee meeting on Health and Cleanliness at his office
yesterday [28 Jul 2005].
