MERS-CoV - update 2 Jun 2013
----------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Italy, through the European Union's Early Warning Response System has notified WHO of an additional 2 laboratory confirmed cases with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the country.

Both patients are close contacts of the recent laboratory confirmed case [who had] recently travelled from Jordan. The 1st patient is a 2 year old girl and the 2nd patient is a 42 year old woman. They are in stable condition.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 53 laboratory confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 30 deaths.

WHO has received reports of laboratory confirmed cases originating in the following countries in the Middle East to date: Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia, and the United Kingdom have also reported laboratory confirmed cases; they were either transferred there for care of the disease or returned from the Middle East and subsequently became ill. In France, Italy, Tunisia, and the United Kingdom, there has been limited local transmission among patients who had not been to the Middle East but had been in close contact with the laboratory confirmed or probable cases.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all member states to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhoea, in patients who are immunocompromised.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.

All member states are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO continues to closely monitor the situation.

[The report above is the official WHO confirmation of infection of the contact cases, raising the official case count to 53 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 30 deaths. According to reports on the Saudi Ministry of Public Health website and posted in the most recent ProMED-mail post (MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (16): Italy ex Jordan, contact cases, WHO 20130602.1750425) there were an additional 3 fatalities reported by Saudi Arabia yesterday (1 Jun 2013) that would bring the global number of fatalities attributable to MERS-CoV infection to 33. We await clarification of this.

ProMED-mail subscriber Roberto Labanti <rlabanti@gmail.com> submitted an additional translated clarification and update with respect to the contact cases and contact tracing ongoing in Italy. Apparently, while one of the machine translations referred to the 2 year old contact case as the granddaughter of the index case, in fact, the word "nipote" in Italian can refer to grandson, granddaughter, nephew, or niece. More information on the 2nd contact case was also provided: the co-worker who was in contact with the index patient for a few hours at work last Monday (27 May 2013) and is a married woman with 3 children, all of whom are currently under observation, according to http://firenze.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/06/01/news/sars_controlli_su_una_bambina_la_nipote_del_paziente_giordano-60124632/?ref=HREC2-8 (in Italian).

Within the framework of the epidemiological surveillance of the novel coronavirus disease (MERS-CoV), the Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced that one case of this virus has been recorded in the Eastern region, and she was suffering from cardiac chronic disease. However, her health status is reassuring.

[The MOH has pointed out that it has tested 51 samples during the past 24 hours, and all of them have resulted negative.]
