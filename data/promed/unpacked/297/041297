Brazil: Deaths Associated with Suspected Hepatitis D Virus
Infection
-------------------------------------------------
At least 20 Marubo indians have died from suspected hepatitis
delta virus infection in the Javari Valley, extreme west of
Amazonas state. The disease also threatens the Matise,
Canamari, and Corubo tribes.
2 boatloads of health personnel, including 4 doctors, departed Sun
11 Apr 2004 from Tabatinga, on the frontier of Brazil with Peru and
Colombia, to take medical aid to the tribes along the Solimoes
[Upper Amazon], Javali, Itaquai, and Itui rivers. The boat is
equipped with ultrasound and digital x-ray machines, and will send
test results by satellite for analysis in Florianopolis, Santa Catarina
state. They expect to examine 1000 Amerindians in the indian
reserve of the Javali Valley, which at 8.5 million hectares is the size
of Portugal.

[Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a defective satellite virus that is
dependent on hepatitis B virus (HBV) for its replication. HDV
infection can be acquired either as a co-infection with HBV or as a
superinfection of persons with chronic HBV infection. Persons with
HBV/HDV co-infection may have more severe acute disease and
a higher risk of fulminant hepatitis (2-20 percent) compared with
those infected with HBV alone; however, chronic HBV infection
appears to occur less frequently in individuals with HBV/HDV co-
infection.
Chronic HBV carriers who acquire HDV superinfection usually
develop chronic HDV infection. In long-term studies of chronic HBV
carriers with HDV superinfection, 70-80 percent have developed
evidence of chronic liver diseases with cirrhosis, compared with 15-
30 percent of patients with chronic HBV infection alone. Control of
HBV infection using HBV vaccine would simultaneously eradicate
any hepatitis D virus, since it is dependent on HBV for its
replication.
Studies performed over the past 35 years on communities in
Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela have shown a high
endemicity of HBV infection all over the region, which is frequently
associated with a high prevalence of infection by hepatitis D virus
among chronic HBV carriers. Circulation of both agents occurs
mainly by horizontal virus transmission during childhood, through
mechanisms that are not fully understood. 3 genotypes of hepatitis
D virus are recognized, genotype III being restricted to the Amazon
basin and South America.
Disease related to HDV infection in these outbreaks has been very
severe, with rapid progression to fulminant hepatitis and
case-fatality rates of 10-20 percent. The cause of the atypical
course of HDV infection in these populations is unknown. The
modes of HDV transmission are similar to those for HBV, with
percutaneous exposures the most efficient. Sexual transmission
of HDV is less efficient than for HBV. Perinatal HDV transmission
is rare. The serologic course of HDV infection varies depending on
whether the virus is acquired as a co-infection with HBV or as a
superinfection of a person with chronic HBV infection. In most
persons with HBV/HDV co-infection, both IgM antibody to HDV
(anti-HDV) and IgG anti-HDV are detectable during the
course of infection. However, in about 15 percent of patients, the
only evidence of HDV infection may be the detection of either IgM
anti-HDV alone during the early acute period of illness or IgG
anti-HDV alone during convalescence. Anti-HDV generally declines
to sub-detectable levels after the infection resolves, and there is no
serologic marker that persists to indicate that the patient was ever
infected with HDV. Hepatitis Delta antigen (HDAg) can be detected
in serum in only about 25 percent of patients with HBV-HDV co-
infection.
When HDAg is detectable it generally disappears as HBsAg
disappears, and most patients do not develop chronic infection. -
