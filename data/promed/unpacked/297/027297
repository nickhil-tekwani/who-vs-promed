2 dead young owls from the Blijdorp Zoo in Rotterdam have been tested
within the ongoing [avian influenza] surveillance undertaken by the
Wild Life Health Centre (Erasmus MC Rotterdam/Utrecht University) and
found infected with the H5N1 virus. Further investigations at the
Lelystad Laboratory [The Central Institute for Animal Disease Control
Lelystad, CIDC] confirmed the above suspicion. Further investigations
are underway to obtain final confirmation of an HPAI infection. The 2
young infected owls had not been vaccinated. Additional sampling and
testing will be carried out in the zoo during the coming days.
Though most birds in the zoo are vaccinated, the birds should be
kept, as far as possible, protected indoors.
Humans may be infected with H5N1 only by close contact with infected
birds or their excrement. Therefore, the zoo will remain open for
visitors, while specific protective measures are prescribed for
personnel engaged in animal handling. However, to be on the safe
side, the zoo will take measures to prevent contact between visitors and birds.

Suspected case of H5N1 bird flu in Rotterdam zoo - owls
-----------------------------------------------
2 young owls that died in a zoo in Rotterdam are suspected of having
the H5N1 bird flu virus, the Dutch farm ministry said late on
Saturday [12 Aug 2006].
The Netherlands, Europe's 2nd biggest poultry producer after France,
has never reported a case of the highly pathogenic avian flu strain,
which is endemic in parts of Asia and has spread to birds in a number
of European Union countries.
A ministry spokeswoman said further tests were being conducted, but
it was suspected that the birds died of a highly pathogenic strain of
the virus. Final test results are due in the coming days.
The H5N1 virus has spread rapidly from late 2003 from Asia to Europe,
the Middle East and Africa. The virus can occasionally infect people
and has killed 138 people over the past 3 years, according to figures
from the World Health Organization [WHO].
No other dead birds have been found, and authorities are currently
testing other birds in the zoological garden, most of which were
vaccinated, the spokeswoman said.
The Netherlands found a low-pathogenic [LPAI] H7 bird flu strain at a
farm earlier this month [August 2006 -- see ref. below]], prompting 5
countries to ban imports of Dutch poultry.
The Dutch suffered a devastating outbreak of an H7N7 avian flu strain
in 2003 that led to the culling of about 1/3rd of the poultry flock,
some 30 million birds.

The detection of an H5N1 virus in young (most probably indigenous)
owls in a Dutch zoo reflects, most probably, virus presence in
(migrating?) wild fauna in the Netherlands; it seems unlikely that
infected birds have been introduced into the zoo otherwise.
Genotyping might help in identifying the possible source or route of
introduction.
The Netherlands is a ardent proponent of (selective) vaccination
against H5N1. The vaccination of the caged birds in the zoo reflects
the applied vaccination policy, updated recently (4 Jul 2006) and
laid out in detail in "Problems solved: 2nd round of poultry
vaccination," available at
