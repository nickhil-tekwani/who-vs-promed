Four Kansas deer recently tested positive for chronic wasting disease [CWD], according to Shane Hesting, Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism disease biologist. The department has been testing for the disease that's always fatal in deer, but has never been found in livestock or humans, for about 15 years. [CWD has been found in captive cervids, but not in other ruminants, and never in humans. This statement of 15 years is misleading. - Mod.TG]

Hesting said the deer came from Ellis, Norton, Sherman, and Trego counties. It's the 1st such case from Ellis County.

CWD was first found in a lone deer in Cheyenne County, in extreme northwest Kansas, in 2005. It's since moved steadily eastward and southward. To date 52 Kansas animals have tested positive for the disease from more than 20 000 tested. In 2011, 8 Kansas deer tested positive for the disease. One was from Stafford County, the closest case to Wichita. A deer killed in Sumner County the same year was initially classified as infected, but it later tested negative.

Hesting said Wildlife and Parks' testing program has changed since the loss of federal funding this year [2013]. Only about 375 deer were tested this year, compared to about 2500 in 2012. To get the most from the limited sample budget, Hesting said Wildlife and Parks is testing different regions of the state annually.

They're also focusing their testing on mature animals, since they have a higher chance of contracting the contagious disease. All 4 of the recent positives were bucks at least 3.5 years old. 3 were shot by hunters. The other was found leaning against a wall in Norton County, emaciated and drooling in October [2012]. A game warden killed the animal and submitted it for testing.

CWD was first found along the Colorado/Wyoming border in the mid-1960s, and has recently been found as far east as Pennsylvania and New York.

[Deer seldom range more than 1 mile radius from their home territory, so the spread of this disease is slow and by the unusual deer that ventures too far from home. - Mod.TG
