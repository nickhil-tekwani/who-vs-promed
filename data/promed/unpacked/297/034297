Barely a month after a cholera outbreak in areas of Nyagatare
District, Eastern [or East] Province, the deadly contagious disease
is now being reported in Rubavu District [Western Province].
The outbreak of the disease, according to some health officials in
the district, has caused panic among many residents who have called
for urgent government intervention.
On 22 Mar 2007, the Ministry of Health issued a press statement
confirming the outbreak of cholera in the area. The ministry also
indicated that at least 55 cholera cases have so far been reported.
No deaths have occurred yet.
Ministry officials attributed the main cause for the outbreak of the
disease in the district to poor hygiene, contaminated water, and
uncontrolled movements of people from affected areas.

The diarrhea outbreak in Labasa has forced authorities to close a
Secondary School hostel that accommodates 78 students. The school
management, upon receiving advice from the Health Inspector, has
closed the Nadogo Secondary School hostel after about 15 students
were found suffering from diarrhea.
School authorities have confirmed that the hostel was ordered to
close late last week after fears that more students may suffer from
diarrhea due to the poor water supply system. The Director of
Northern Health Services is expected to comment on the outbreak later.
