Nepal
- Kathmandu district. 8 Feb 2019. On 8 Feb 2019, a 34-year-old female, resident of Kathmandu, visited the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital to evaluate her medical condition after she was laboratory confirmed with dengue virus in India 2 weeks ago. She had a history of high-grade fever, severe joint and retro-orbital pain, severe headache, nausea, and rashes. She was initially treated for systematic lupus ethrythematosus (SLE) based on a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test. Her symptoms, however, got worse. She then visited a leading hospital in New Delhi, where SLE was ruled out but IgM tested positive for dengue virus. She denied any history of travel beyond Kathmandu city. This is the 1st reported case of dengue virus in Kathmandu this year (2019).

A dengue outbreak was also observed in Kathmandu (Balaju area) about 3 months ago (2018). According to the patient, even at the present day, they can see mosquitos in and around their house, where water is collected.

- Tahiti ex New Caledonia. 13 Feb 2019. A health alert has been issued in French Polynesia after one case of dengue type 2 was diagnosed. A man who had arrived from New Caledonia has come down with the mosquito-borne illness in Mahina. He has been transferred to the main hospital in Tahiti. The neighbourhood of Mahina he stayed in is being sprayed in the hope of eliminating mosquitoes that could transmit the virus. French Polynesia has been spared a dengue type 2 epidemic for about 2 decades, which means that the public has low immunity to the disease. Last year, 2 cases were diagnosed in Raiatea, but the outbreak was contained.

[2] Insecticide resistance conferring allele
Date: Thu 31 Jan 2019

Ref. Kasai S, Caputo B, Tsunoda T, Cuong TC, et al.: 1st detection of a _Vssc_ allele V1016G conferring a high level of insecticide resistance in _Aedes albopictus_ collected from Europe (Italy) and Asia (Viet Nam), 2016: a new emerging threat to controlling arboviral diseases. Euro Surveill. 2019; 24(5): 1700847. doi: 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2019.24.5.1700847.

Abstract
Introduction. _Aedes albopictus_ (Skuse) is an important vector of arboviral diseases, including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus disease. Monitoring insecticide resistance and mechanisms by which the mosquito develops resistance is crucial to minimise disease transmission.
Aim. To determine insecticide resistance status and mechanisms in _Ae. albopictus_ from different geographical regions.

Methods. We sampled 33 populations of _Ae. albopictus_ from Asia, Europe, and South America and tested these for susceptibility to permethrin, a pyrethroid insecticide. In resistant populations, the target site for pyrethroids, a voltage-sensitive sodium channel (_Vssc_) was genotyped. Three resistant sub-strains, each harbouring a resistance allele homozygously, were established and susceptibilities to 3 different pyrethroids (with and without a cytochrome P450 inhibitor) were assayed.

Results. Most populations of _Ae. albopictus_ tested were highly susceptible to permethrin, but a few from Italy and Vietnam (4/33), exhibited high-level resistance. Genotyping studies detected a knockdown resistance (kdr) allele V1016G in _Vssc_ for the 1st time in _Ae. albopictus_. Two previously reported kdr alleles, F1534C and F1534S, were also detected. The bioassays indicated that the strain homozygous for the V1016G allele showed much greater levels of pyrethroid resistance than other strains harbouring F1534C or F1534S.

Conclusion. The V1016G allele was detected in both Asian and Italian _Ae. albopictus_ populations, thus a spread of this allele beyond Italy in Europe cannot be ruled out. This study emphasises the necessity to frequently and regularly monitor the V1016G allele in _Ae. albopictus_, particularly where this mosquito species is the main vector of arboviruses.

[3] Research: gene signature for dengue severity
Date: Tue 29 Jan 2019
Source: Genome Web [abridged, edited]
https://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/dengue-severity-predicted-gene-expression-signature-patient-blood?utm_ source=Sailthru&utm _medium=email&utm_ campaign=GWDN %20Tues%20PM%202019-01-29&utm_term=GW%20Daily%20News%20Bulletin#.XFGor1xKjIU


A team from the USA and Colombia has identified a blood gene expression signature that shows promise for finding the dengue virus cases that are most prone to progress to severe infections, both in retrospective and prospective patient cohorts.

The researchers brought together whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene expression findings from 7 prior studies, spanning nearly 450 dengue virus-infected individuals from 5 countries. Using these data and an integrated analytical framework, they narrowed in on 20 genes with expression that varied in individuals with severe dengue infections.

As reported online today [Tue 29 Jan 2019] in Cell Reports, the team found that the 20-gene signature could also discern severe dengue cases in retrospective studies involving 84 infected individuals from 3 countries and in a prospective analysis of longitudinal samples from nearly 36 dengue patients from Colombia.

In those cohorts, the investigators reported, the expression profiles of the 20 genes in question picked up severe dengue cases with 76% specificity and 100% sensitivity. If those results hold in future validation studies, they suggested that it may eventually be possible to pursue a prognostic assay that incorporates the blood-based expression signature.

The team's initial analysis highlighted 59 genes with significant expression differences in the dengue hemorrhagic fever and/or dengue shock syndrome patients compared to individuals with uncomplicated dengue fever. With additional computational analyses, the set was whittled down to a set of 17 genes with lower-than-usual expression and 3 over-expressed genes in the severe dengue patients.

"The roles of the 20 gene products in the pathogenesis of severe dengue will be studied in the future," the authors wrote, noting that many of them are implicated in various aspects of antiviral innate immune responses.
