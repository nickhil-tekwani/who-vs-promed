At least 20 peacocks died and more than 2 dozen were affected of deadly Newcastle disease in a couple of days.
Local sources said that lives of peacocks, the natural beauty of Tharparkar, was at stake as 20 peacocks have died during the last 2 to 3 days of 'Ranikhet' [Newcastle] disease in village Mithi, [Tharparkar District in the Sindh province].

They said more than 2 dozen other peacocks were affected by the deadly disease. The officials of wildlife department had perceived the reasons of outspread of the disease and its treatment to save the precious birds, he added.

The locals complained that due to Eid vacations [religious holidays] they failed to contact the wildlife officials and employees and it was feared that toll due to Newcastle will increase further in the coming days.

They urged the provincial government and authorities to take notice of the situation and deploy special teams for saving the precious birds. It is pertinent to add that hundreds of peacocks died due to 'Ranikhet' in Tharparkar during the last few years and despite repeated assurances the department concerned failed to make efforts to deal with the disease.
