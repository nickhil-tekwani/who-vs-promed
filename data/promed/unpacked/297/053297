A 16-year Humble High School student believed to
have been infected with rabies by a bat died
Friday after a weeklong battle against the fatal
disease.
The announcement of his death stunned classmates
and parents in the Humble-Atascocita area, where
residents held nightly vigils to pray for the
popular teen.
Texas Children's Hospital announced the teen's
death in a statement Friday evening.
"The family wishes to express its thanks to the
community for their prayers and support," the
statement concluded. In a subsequent statement,
the hospital noted that the devastating viral
disease, which attacks the body's central nervous
system, is almost always fatal.
The lone known case of an unvaccinated person
surviving rabies -- a 15-year-old Wisconsin girl
in 2004 -- had given the family and friends a ray
of hope, particularly after it was learned the
boy's doctors were treating him with a
combination of drugs and sedation similar to that
used to treat her.
But Texas Children's Hospital spokeswoman Ann
Brimberry said Friday that the Wisconsin girl is
thought to have had a different strain of rabies
than this victim. Additionally, the boy's
infection had progressed further than the
Wisconsin girl's had by the time he was
hospitalized.
The victim was hospitalized on 6 May 2006.
Several weeks earlier, his family reported he had
awakened in his bedroom after being brushed on
the face by a bat that had entered an open
window. The bat was captured and let go outside
and the boy did not seek medical attention until
falling ill last week.
Because of the rarity of human cases -- about 3
cases are reported each year in the United
States; about 55 000 annually worldwide -- this
victim's illness garnered national attention and
an avalanche of prayers and support from friends
and acquaintances throughout the
Humble-Atascocita area.
It also sparked fear in area residents about the
possibilities of contracting the viral disease.
Of particular concern for some officials and
parents was the boy's Humble Wildcats football
teammates, some of whom may have drunk out of the
same water bottle during practices.
Public health experts said it is possible, in
theory, to transmit the disease to other people
through saliva, but noted there have been no
documented cases of that happening. Nonetheless,
as a precaution, officials with Harris County
Public Health and Environmental Services have
recommended that about 30 of the victim's
classmates seek medical attention.
A Humble Independent School District spokeswoman
said earlier this week that the victim's
girlfriend was undergoing a series of
vaccinations.
Dr. Rodney Willoughby, a pediatric infectious
disease specialist who treated the Wisconsin
rabies survivor and who consulted with Houston
doctors on this victim, expressed regret at the
news: "I feel badly about the boy. I know the
physicians tried hard, and it just wasn't right.
Too short a timeline to get everything to happen."
Willoughby was referring to 2 of the drugs used
in the Wisconsin girl's case, which require
special permission from federal drug regulators.
The drugs are part of a combination of sedation
and antiviral medications.
Coincidentally, Willoughby was in meetings this
week with Centers for Disease Control officials
trying to figure out how a package of special
drugs can be sent out rapidly to hospitals
treating rabies victims.
The victim's illness marked the 4th time doctors
have tried to replicate the Wisconsin success. A
key problem in treating rabies is that it kills
so fast, advancing from no symptoms to death in 5
to 7 days.
"We honestly don't know if it will ever work," Willoughby said.

[In fact the greatest risk for naturally acquired
rabies in the United States is from encounters
with and bites from insectivorous bats. In
particular, a rabies virus variant associated
with 2 small-bodied bats, the eastern pipistrelle
bat (_Pipistrellus subflavus_) and silver-haired
bat (_Lasionycteris noctivagans_), was identified
in 20 (69 percent) of 29 persons with samples
tested. See: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report, Fri 12 Aug 2005 /54(31);767-769.

[Bat-associated rabies virus variants are known
to be present in South Texas and Houston.
Furthermore, any time there is contact or even
suspected contact with a bat (for example,
awakening in a room where a bat is found, or if a
bat is found in a room with a small child) the
person should immediately seek medical help and
post-exposure prophylaxis. Screens on windows are
another way to help deter bats from entering the
home. - Mod.TG]
