Bug affects kebab shop customers
-----------------------------------
More than 160 people who ate at a kebab shop were struck down with food
poisoning in one of London's largest outbreaks in recent years.
Environmental health officers have closed the shop for a month and
confirmed 60 cases of salmonellosis.
Newham Hospital said there were so many cases ambulances had to be diverted
to other facilities on 13 Feb 2005. Newham Council said it was unknown if
bad meat was the cause.
A council spokeswoman added the shop owners were co-operating fully with
the investigation and have implemented health officers'
recommendations. The takeaway shop reopened this week.
Katherine Lewis, of the Health Protection Agency, said: "We are testing
samples to see what sort of salmonella is behind this."
One customer who went to hospital 3 times after eating food from the
takeaway said the shop should not have reopened. "I don't think they
should be providing food for the community because the sheer number of
people they put in hospital is ridiculous," he said.
The customer, a 33-year-old IT [information technology] manager from Manor
Park, London, was off work for 3 weeks and lost more than a stone [see
below - Mod.LL] in weight after he ate chicken, chick peas, potatoes and
salad with chili sauce.
"I had severe diarrhea, vomiting, fever and cold sweats plus waves of pins
and needles all over my body," he said.
A spokesman from Newham University Hospital said 154 people attended the
hospital between 11 and 14 Feb 2005 with symptoms of food poisoning. "The
majority of these patients were treated and discharged, but 11 patients
needed further treatment," he said.

[With the outbreak being about 1 month old, one would think that the
serotype of salmonellosis involved here would be known and a food survey of
affected and unaffected patrons would have been done to assist in sorting
out the food or foods involved. Salmonellosis outbreaks can be associated
with a myriad of foods, including poorly prepared meat or dairy products as
well as contaminated uncooked salad or other products.
For readers who are not familiar with the UK avoirdupois weight system, the
following partial list is submitted: 7 pounds is 1 clove, 14 pounds is 1
stone, and 28 pounds is 1 tod. The word avoirdupois is a word referring to
weight, specifically heaviness. It is derived from Middle English _avoir
de pois_ meaning goods sold by weight. - Mod.LL]
