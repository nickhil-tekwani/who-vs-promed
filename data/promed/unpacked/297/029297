The Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) has confirmed a raccoon was found near Shivers Green Road and Springdale Road in Ridgeway testing positive for rabies.

One person was potentially exposed to saliva from open wounds on their hands and has been referred to their healthcare provider. According to DHEC officials, 2 dogs were exposed and will be quarantined as required [It would have been helpful to know the vaccination status of the dogs. - Mod.TG].

If you think you have been exposed to the rabies virus through a bite, scratch, or the saliva of a possibly infected animal, immediately wash the affected area with plenty of soap and water," said David Vaughan, Director of DHEC's Onsite Wastewater, Rabies Prevention, and Enforcement Division. "Be sure to get medical attention, and report the incident to DHEC. If your pet is found with wounds of unknown origin, please consider your pet could have been exposed to rabies and contact DHEC's Environmental Affairs Sumter office during normal business hours (8:30 a.m.-5:00 p.m., Monday-Friday).

To report a bite or exposure on holidays or times outside of normal business hours, please call the DHEC after-hours service number.

A fox received by the Florida Department of Health in Jackson County (FDOH Jackson) has tested positive for rabies according to lab results received from the Department of Health Tampa Branch Lab.

The fox attacked 2 individuals on Butler Road north of Grand Ridge, according to a press release from the Florida Department of Health's Jackson County Health Department.

The animal was euthanized by a Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Officer, officials said.

T.G. Harkrider, Environmental Health Director at FDOH Jackson, stated that anyone having knowledge of bites or other exposure from a suspected rabid animal to humans or to domestic animals should immediately contact the Health Department during normal working hours.

Additionally, an answering service is available to relay information for assistance after hours and on weekends concerning animal bites and other exposure.

"Please call us with information and questions related to exposure," Harkrider stressed. "We need to act quickly in some cases to save people's lives. Never shoot a biting animal in the head," he added.

"An intact brain is needed to determine if the animal is rabid. If you shoot them in the head and destroy the brain, we have to assume the animal was rabid. Without negative lab results, treatment to the victim has to begin. Please call us. You can reach us 24 hours a day and 7 days a week through our answering service."

Health officials in Prince George's County, Maryland are asking anyone who might have come into contact with a brown tabby cat in the area of Croom Road in Upper Marlboro to get in touch with them.

On Monday [26 Oct 2020], a brown tabby cat, believed to be a stray, bit 2 people. The cat was captured and euthanized, and the Maryland Department of Health confirmed that the cat tested positive for rabies.

Health officials urge you to contact them if you or any of your pets might have come into contact with the cat between 12 Oct and 26 Oct 2020.

Rabies is transmitted through the saliva of infected animals and can be life-threatening.

If you come across a stray animal, do not approach it, and make sure you follow leash laws with your pet. Make sure your pets' vaccinations are up to date.

If you've been bitten or exposed to an animal that may be rabid, get medical attention immediately, and report the exposure to your local animal control agency or health department.

Information on rabies and prevention can be found on Maryland's health department website:

[Any mammal can carry rabies. The saddest thing about rabies is that we have the power to prevent it, and so many people do not vaccinate their animals. While it is difficult to vaccinate wild animals, our domestic animals should all be vaccinated. Yes, it includes our livestock.

As for vaccinating wildlife, it can be done through oral baits and has been done with moderate to good success. It has decreased the rabies burden in the wildlife population where the aerial bait drops have been done.

Wildlife who are unafraid of you or who are actively aggressive may have rabies. Rabies has 2 forms: the furious form and the dumb from. Those with the furious form are usually aggressive and may be salivating, while the other form may cause an animal to appear hurt, or hungry, or seeking companionship.

Build a barrier between you and this disease. Have your pet vaccinated against rabies. Rabid or wild animals can attack pets, as well as ourselves. If your pet is unvaccinated and attacked, it will be euthanized. So, protect your pets and yourselves. - Mod.TG]
