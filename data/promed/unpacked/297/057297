From: Dr Antonio Lavazza <ALavazza@bs.izs.it>

I am the Secretary of Societa Italiana di Patologia Aviare (SIPA), the
national branch of the World Veterinary Poultry Association (WVPA). I would
like to inform you that all the official and updated information regarding
Avian Influenza in Italy (low pathogenic epidemic started in March 1999 as
well as highly pathogenic epidemic started in December 1999) can be found
at the web site of our Society which is the following:
<http://web.tiscalinet.it/sipawvpa>.
Most of the data are schematically reported and, I think, could be
understood even if written in Italian. Indeed you will find some reports
(presented to the EU or to the Meeting of National Reference Centres) in
English. My opinion is all the necessary information for getting a correct
idea of the present situation are there.
