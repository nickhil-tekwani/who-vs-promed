The Virginia Aquarium is struggling to find the resources to keep up with the increasing amount of dead dolphins washing ashore.

This past weekend [17-18 Aug 2013], 25 dolphins were stranded along Virginia's coast, bringing the grisly toll of dead dolphins to 164, according to the Virginia Aquarium.

"We're at kind of crises phase; our staff is operating at max capacity as well as our volunteers," said Joan Barns, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Aquarium.

The Virginia Aquarium's Stranding Response Team is responsible for collecting all of the deceased mammals throughout the state. The aquarium is now asking the public for help to keep the team running.

The team is made up of dozens of volunteers and a handful of staff members, all of whom have had their hands full these past few weeks [July - August 2013]. As bodies continue to wash up, the aquarium says it needs financial help from the public to keep the team running.

"Our funding for the year [2013] for marine mammal strandings has already been spent," Barns told 13 News Now, explaining donations will be used to purchase additional supplies and possibly fund another staff position.

The mass dolphin die-off continues to baffle scientists. Initially, researchers thought a virus may be to blame, but no definitive conclusions have been made.

"It's really too early to say whether the morbillivirus virus is responsible for this [outbreak], because at this point, we only have 3 dolphins that have tested positive for that [virus]," explained Barns.

So far this year [2013], Virginia has seen the highest number of stranded dolphins compared to other states along the east coast.

"You have to keep in mind that Virginia has a lot of shoreline, especially when you include the lower Chesapeake Bay area. With that, coupled with the fact that we have a high dolphin population in the summer, it kind of makes sense that we have been hit the hardest," said Barns.

[Most likely, this episode is linked to the dolphin die-off in NJ (see ProMED-mail post 20130806.1866271), where they also suspect morbillivirus, but there is no conclusive evidence. We await test results that shed some light on these mortalities. - Mod.PMB
