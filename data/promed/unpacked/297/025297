Ottawa's public health unit has seen a 76 per cent increase in the number of cases of infectious syphilis. Ottawa Public Health said Thu [23 Jul 2015] it has recorded 65 syphilis cases in the past 12 months (July 2014 to June 2015) compared with 37 in the prior 12 months. All of the cases in the past year have been men, and more than 90 per cent are men who have sex with men [MSM].

The number of cases is strikingly high. The health board recorded 46 syphilis cases in 2014 and 32 in 2013.

Ottawa Public Health recommends screening for those at risk of contracting syphilis, which is primarily transmitted by unprotected sex. They recommend screening for the following groups:
- People who have a sexual partner diagnosed with syphilis
- People with multiple sexual partners, especially men who have sex with men
- Sexually active people showing signs and symptoms consistent with syphilis
- Women who are pregnant or considering pregnancy

Syphilis symptoms may include a painless sore and rashes on palms of the hands or soles of the feet. Individuals can be infected and not know they have it. Syphilis is easily cured with antibiotics when treated early, but delayed treatment can result in severe and irreversible damage to organs including the heart, brain, liver, bones and eyes, according to Ottawa Public Health.

[Ottawa is the capital city of Canada, situated in the Eastern subregion of the Canadian province of Ontario on the border with the Canadian province of Quebec (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa); it is about 124 miles (200 km) west of the city of Montreal. The city of Ottawa has an estimated population of 943 260 in 2013. A map of Canada, showing the location of Ottawa, is available at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ottawa,+ON,+Canada.

Outbreaks of syphilis among men who have sex with men (MSM) are occurring worldwide, including in other parts of Canada (see prior ProMED-mail posts listed below). The news report above does not characterize the outbreak of syphilis in Ottawa other than saying that the affected population is primarily MSM. The rising number of cases of syphilis in Ottawa may be due to increased syphilis screening in this population, but there is also likely a true increase in cases due to a variety of reasons that promote unprotected sex, such as engaging in unprotected sex only with partners perceived to have the same HIV status as one's own (serosorting), taking preexposure or postexposure HIV prophylaxis, use of psychoactive "party drugs," use of smartphone apps that facilitate anonymous "hookups," etc. More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
