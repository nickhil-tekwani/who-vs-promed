2 Ebola vaccines clear safety tests in Liberia
----------------------------------------------
The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) said that 2 experimental Ebola vaccines, one from GlaxoSmithKline plc (ADR) and another from NewLink Genetics Corp, "appear to be safe," as per the initial data review of mid-stage clinical trials currently underway in Liberia. The trial subjects were randomly injected with the GSK vaccine, the NewLink vaccine, and a saline shot. The trial volunteers and researchers remained completely unaware of which subject had received which injection. The results were then evaluated on the basis of the subjects' immune system response to the injection in the form of anti-Ebola antibody production.

The positive results, revealed only part-way through the study, give a go-ahead to the next stage of efficiency trials for the 2 vaccines, which would be conducted in additional trial subjects. The researchers intend to enroll around 1500 trial volunteers by April 2015. They are specifically aiming to enroll more women, since they comprised 16 percent of the 1st volunteer group. This would make sure the study results remain free from any gender-based variances. The study is expected to involve continuous monitoring of the volunteers. Blood samples will be collected and tested after 6 and 12 weeks of vaccination.

[It is good there is an effort to include women in the vaccine trials. It also is hoped a range of age groups is included. The GSK vaccine uses chimpanzee adenovirus type 3 (ChAd3), as a carrier to deliver genetic material from the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus, which is responsible for the current Ebola outbreak in west Africa. NewLink's vaccine combines an Ebola gene with an attenuated or weakened vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a pathogen found in livestock. One of the genes from VSV is replaced by a gene from the Ebola virus. The Ebola gene makes a harmless protein that sits on the virus's outer coat. - Mod.LK]

[2] Liberia case fatality
Date: Sat 28 Mar 2015

A woman who was Liberia's sole remaining known Ebola patient has died at a treatment centre in the capital, said Francis Ketteh, acting head of the country's Ebola response team. The case was Liberia's 1st in weeks and it set back efforts to halt a virus that has killed more than 10 000 people in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone.

Authorities say the woman, who died in Monrovia on [Fri 27 Mar 2015], may have contracted Ebola through sex with a survivor, the Reuters news agency reported. "We have been able to trace the people she came in contact with," Ketteh said. "We call on everyone to follow the Ebola preventative measures."

Before the woman fell ill, the Liberian government had hoped to declare the country Ebola-free next month, 42 days after the last patient tested negative for a 2nd time, which would mark double the length of the virus's incubation period.

Health officials have warned the general population that even after areas are declared free of the disease, new cases are possible through sexual transmission. Liberia remains vulnerable to cases imported from Guinea and Sierra Leone.

Starting on Fri [27 Mar 2015], Sierra Leone's 6 million people were being confined to their homes for 3 days as nation resorted again to a sweeping shutdown in a final push to stamp out Ebola. Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma vowed to do "whatever it takes" to get to 0 cases.

Guinea has reported a rash of new cases of the disease, which had appeared to be on the wane.

[This case was the last confirmed case since Liberia was close to being declared Ebola-free, but sadly, 2 additional people are suspected of having Ebola virus disease in the country (one of whom is this patient's 18-year-old daughter), postponing achievement of Liberia's goal to be Ebola-free by April 2015. The World Health Organization (WHO) requires countries prove there are no new cases of Ebola reported for 42 days before that country can be officially declared virus-free (because the incubation period is 21 days). While this is a heartbreaking setback, Liberia is better prepared to manage new cases than at the outset and is still well on the path to reaching the goal of no new cases soon. - Mod.LK]

[3] Suspected, monitored, quarantined, prevention
28 Mar 2015: Guinea deploys police as Sierra Leoneans cross border while fleeing Ebola lockdown
http://www.startribune.com/world/297879901.html

[According to Guinea spokesperson, Mamadou Alpha Barry, as a response to reports that Sierra Leoneans were crossing the border to flee an Ebola lockdown, Guinea sent security forces to Guinea's southwestern region. The purpose of the lockdown (in which Sierra Leone residents are confined to their homes) is to facilitate contract tracers' ability to locate contacts, and to give educational outreach workers greater opportunity to educate and reinforce the message about Ebola.

28 Mar 2015: Guinea president announces new emergency measures in Ebola fight
http://www.trust.org/item/20150328225809-0d0av/
[President Alpha Conde announced on Sat 28 Mar 2015, new emergency measures enabling authorities to restrict movements in western Guinea (Districts Forecariah, Coyah, Dubreka, Boffa, and Kindia) and a reinforcement of emergency measures for 45 days. Food and medical supplies would be given to the affected communities. In addition to the previously noted 3 doctors in a Conakry hospital who were infected with the virus because of a lack of infection control, 6 additional medical staff across 3 clinics (including doctors) in western Guinea have been infected]

29 Mar 2015: Guinea weighs lockdowns as West Africa continues Ebola fight
http://www.sunherald.com/2015/03/29/6149071_guinea-president-reinforces-emergency.html
[New emergency measures enacted by President Conde include requirement for all burials in the affected areas to be secured by Red Cross or security forces, and all dead bodies will be systematically tested. Mourning ceremonies will be restricted to close family. Lockdowns are part of possible measures that can be implemented.]

27 Mar 2015: Liberia: Ebola fear dwarfs school enrollment in Tewor District
http://allafrica.com/stories/201503271075.html
[The drastic drop in student population is attributed to the Ebola uncertainty among parents to send their children to school.]

29 Mar 2015: Liberia calls for sexual abstinence to cut Ebola transmission risk
http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/29/health-ebola-liberia-idUSL6N0WV0PG20150329?rpc=401
[On Sun 29 Mar 2015, Liberia called on Ebola survivors to strictly observe a period of sexual abstinence after recovering from the disease, amid fears the country's last case may have resulted from sexual transmission.]

[Since the pore size of condoms is thought to prevent exposure to the virus, using such prophylactics for a minimum of 3 months may be a more successful approach to preventing Ebola than total abstinence. The latter may be difficult to achieve.

Investigators WD Cardona-Maya and colleagues examined research on male Ebola survivors that was conducted between 1977 and 2007, and found only 4 studies that contained information about Ebola in men's semen. Those 4 studies showed that the Ebola virus persisted in semen for an average of more than 66 days. In one man, the virus lasted for 91 days.

[Adjustment in Ebola response is secondary to a greatly reduced infection rate.]

28 Mar 2015 Sierra Leone: Ebola: Police fire tear gas at crowd in Sierra Leone during protests against lockdown
http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-29/police-fire-tear-gas-in-sierra-leone-during-ebola-lockdown/6356340
[Police fired tear gas at an angry crowd in Sierra Leone after members of the crowd threw stones at officials during a 3-day national lockdown the government hopes will accelerate the end of the Ebola epidemic. Hundreds of people left their homes in the Devil Hole neighborhood outside the capital to gather at a food collection point. Some residents complained they had not received food. Fighting broke out, until police arrived to scatter the crowd. Elsewhere in the dense slums of eastern and central Freetown, residents defied the lockdown rules and wandered out onto the streets in search of supplies.]

[The lockdown seems like a strong epidemiologic approach, given there is sufficient warning of the lockdown and ample provisions for people to be able to feed their families without leaving home. See following post. - Mod.LK]

28 Mar 2015: 1 year on -- lessons from the Ebola outbreak for WHO
http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960619-5/fulltext
[The year 2015 will see at least 3 more international, independent investigations into WHO's conduct in the Ebola response. Regrettably, it is likely that the World Health Organization's reputation is going to suffer further in the coming months. The Lancet's focus will be to attempt to draw larger lessons from the Ebola outbreak. In early May 2015, The Lancet will publish a collection of essays on global health security, together with one of the first analyses of the deeper consequences of Ebola]
