Over the past several weeks, Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (OPD) has been receiving dozens of patients with post-viral cough, who have having lingering cough (mostly dry cough) for more than 3 weeks [following] influenza like illness (ILI). At present, similar cases are being seen elsewhere beyond Kathmandu (personnel communication with my colleagues). This is the 1st observation of sudden increase in the number of post-viral cough ever made in Nepal following ILI. 80 percent of patients who visited OPD with PCR confirmation of influenza virus were found to be type B, contrary to previous years. Therefore, it would be interesting to study further to find out if there is any relationship between influenza type B and post-viral cough.

[ProMED thanks Dr Sher Bahadur Pun for his valuable contribution on recent influenza B cases in Kathmandu, Nepal.

Patients who complain of a persistent cough lasting longer than 3 weeks after experiencing the acute symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection, may have a post-infectious cough, generally due to persistence of influenza inflammation and irritation because of compromised upper or lower airway tissue (epithelial) integrity in the respiratory tract. As secretions drain from the upper airways (as with post-nasal drip), the cough reflex can be triggered. Common causes of post-viral cough, in addition to influenza, include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza (commonly associated with croup), and adenovirus infections.

Although the patients are no longer infectious by 10 days after onset of illness, the cough can last up to 3 weeks or more, despite taking symptomatic treatment with decongestants and antihistamines.

Even though this cough is unlikely to constitute a risk of spreading the infection to others, it certainly sounds like a potential threat, so wearing a mask is advised as a courtesy and a reminder to protect others. - Mod.UBA
