I apologize for having missed a zero for the dog population of Tarlac. As
cited by the Manila Times, this population is estimated in aprox. 208 000
dogs; this many doses of vaccine would cost US$50,000.

[Indeed, this number of doses would easily cost the US$50,000. Thank you
for the correction. - Mod.TG

Dr. Larghi's point as well as that of the moderator are appreciated. We
need to exploit cheaper options in zoonotic control in developing
countries. A complimentary or even substantial part of the program may
prove long term cost-effective would be the elimination of stray dogs
(plentiful in these areas) as well as public health campaigns to reduce
irresponsible/unnecessary/unaffordable pet ownership. An educational
campaign, well marshalled and executed, would have a lasting impact on the
target audience in the community. This will be amplified when such effects
are passed on to generations. In this way, the general public would imbibe
the ideals of the campaign and thus maintain and perpetuate the momentum
required for zoonotic prevention in urban populace.Any program that places
more emphasis on the vaccination approach may overburden often limited
/scarce veterinary personnel.

[From a previous ProMED-mail posting: Dr. Larghi point is well taken. Using
current figures from US suppliers, I have found prices as inexpensive in
the USA as US$15 000 for rabies vaccine for 20 800 dogs. It is much more
economical to vaccinate the dogs than to treat large numbers of people
exposed to rabies. - Mod.TG
True, but unless everyone believes in and relies on the up-to-date
vaccination of all dogs, some patients and their physicians are likely to
insist on people bitten still getting vaccine and antiserum.
Maybe this can be overcome if dogs have vaccination records, and are kept
under surveillance for a period after a bite. Provided the dog giving the
bite is known, if it remains healthy for a week afterwards it was very
unlikely to have given an infective bite.
