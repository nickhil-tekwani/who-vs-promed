Germany has seen its 1st confirmed case of the mosquito-spread West Nile virus in a human.

"The person from [the eastern state of] Saxony suffered from encephalitis, was treated at the Klinikum St Georg in Leipzig, and has recovered," several institutions, including the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, announced on Friday [27 Sep 2019].

The virus often does not cause symptoms in humans. Serious and deadly cases are rare and usually involve older people with pre-existing illnesses.

So far in Germany, there had only been cases involving travellers who contracted the disease in affected regions.

The virus, which originally stems from Africa, 1st occurred in Germany in animals in 2018. It is transmitted by certain breeds of mosquitoes. Owls, birds of prey, and ravens are the virus' most common hosts. However, it can also be transmitted to horses and humans.

[Germany's 1st clinical case of WNV in a vertebrate, a year back (August 2018), involved an owl (20180831.6000100). This reflects the role of animals as sentinels for human infection and highlights the importance of surveillance in animals. - Mod.UBA]

In a sign that the illness hasn't abated yet, the death toll in Greece from the mosquito-carried West Nile virus that began in June 2019 has grown to 25, the National Health Organization (EODY) said in a report. Through 19 Sep 2019, authorities had diagnosed 195 cases of the virus. Of these, 121 developed illnesses affecting the central nervous system, such as encephalitis or meningitis.

EODY again urged the public to put insect repellent on bare skin and clothing, install mosquito nets and screens, to remove stagnant water from basins, vases and gutters, regularly mow lawns, and to water plants in the morning.

Earlier in August 2019, the Athens Medical Association (ISA) joined in warning the public to take simple precautions ranging from using repellent to wearing clothes that cover the skin in the middle of summer.

ISA also advised the use of mosquito nets, fans or air conditioners and yellow bug lights, but it wasn't said whether it also recommended electric zappers that kill the insects or citronella. Other measures include checking that there is no standing water sitting around in basins, jars, pots and gutters, as well as mowing lawns, trimming shrubs and clearing dead leaves. Plants and gardens, it added, should be watered in the morning rather than later in the day.

"There have been enough cases to know that this is now a public health issue," Danai Pervanidou who heads the office for vector-borne diseases at the national organisation for public health (KEELPNO) told the British newspaper The Guardian's correspondent Helena Smith in June 2019.

"The virus has established itself in Greece through migratory birds, and we are recommending that everyone takes personal protective measures such as wearing long sleeves, avoiding places with stagnant water, and using mosquito nets and repellent," she said.

In a transmission season that began unusually early, laboratory diagnosed cases were reported in both rural and urban areas, according to KEELPNO. Many of those who contract the virus after being bitten won't show any symptoms.
