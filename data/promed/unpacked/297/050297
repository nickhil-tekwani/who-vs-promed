Yesterday [27 Nov 2011], another person died of rabies in
Morona-Santiago. With this one, the number of dead children [from
rabies] totals 6 this month. The Health Office of this province
registered only 4 laboratory confirmed cases. The Achuar [indigenous]
Nationality of Ecuador (NAE) organization counts 6 children who died
from bat bites in the Achuar de Tarimiat and Suarik Nuevo communities
in the Taisha canton. These mammals [bats] are the carriers of rabies
virus.

In addition, there are 8 children with [rabies] symptoms: bodily
shaking, convulsions, fever, headache, drooling ... 3 of these are
interned in the General de Macas Hospital in critical condition,
according to the health director of the NAE, Mario Wisum. But the head
of the Health Office, Susana Aguilar, said that the health status of
the admitted patients is stable. This is worrying for Wisum [because]
all the children with [these] symptoms have died. "Up to now, none has
been saved."

Wisum stated that a team of physicians from the Ministry of Health are
in the communities immunizing the people. But they have not brought
the vaccine to the entire canton (18 437 inhabitants) because they are
considering only children and people who have been attacked [by
bats].

According to Aguilar, 4900 doses [of rabies vaccine] have been brought
in since the outbreak began. Everyone needs 7 [doses]. Yesterday [27
Nov 2011], Wisum met with the health director of Pastaza, Kleber
Samaniego. He requested that he launch a vaccination campaign in the
Acap, Arutam, Capavi, and Macusar communities, neighboring the
currently affected ones, to prevent spread of the virus.

[In September 2011 there were bovine cases of vampire bat transmitted
rabies in the same area (Morona-Santiago) (see ProMED-mail archive no 20110925.2907). Now there are cases in Achuar children. The Achuar
indigenous tribe constitutes an Amazonian populace that lives in
several communities along either side of the border between Ecuador
and Peru. Curiously, no mention is made about what is going on across
the border in Peru. There have been several human cases of vampire bat
transmitted rabies in the Peruvian Amazon this year (2011) (see
ProMED-mail posts listed below).

The bat involved in transmission of rabies virus in this outbreak is
most likely _Desmodus rotundus_, the most common hematophagous bat in
the region. It is likely that these indigenous people in this hot,
humid environment live in open shelters providing easy access for the
bats to sleeping individuals. Usually, cattle and horses are preferred
hosts for the vampire bats. Bovine rabies of vampire bat origin has
been a problem in 3 locations in Ecuador this year (2011). This is the
1st reported rabies outbreak involving people in 2011 in Ecuador.

It is not clear why 7 doses of the vaccine are being applied in this
outbreak, when the WHO recommends 3 doses prior to exposure and 4
doses post-exposure along with immunoglobulin administration at the
site of the bite. The type of vaccine used in this outbreak is not
stated.

The Taisha canton in Morona-Santiago is located in east-central
Ecuador, in the Amazon basin. A map showing its location can be
