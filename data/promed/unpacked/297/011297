Hepatitis E in passengers on a cruise ship
------------------------------------------
Four cases of hepatitis E infection were reported among elderly male
passengers on a round-the-world cruise between 7 Jan 2008 and 28 Mar 2008.
The dates of onset were between 12 and 23 March and it is thought highly
likely that exposure occurred at some point during the cruise. There were a
number of ports of call including: Madeira, Barbados, Acapulco, San
Francisco, Pago Pago (American Samoa), Nuku'Alofa (Tonga), Auckland, Sydney
and Hong Kong.

The passenger capacity of the cruise ship is 1800 with 900 staff but, as
people joined and left the cruise at different points during the journey,
the cumulative number of passengers on board at some point during the
cruise was 3000. Passengers were mainly from the UK but also included
nationals from the USA, Australia, South Africa, Denmark, and Ireland.

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has been working closely with the cruise
ship operator and port health authority to assist with investigations and
ensure all passengers receive appropriate information. The cruise company
has sent letters and a factsheet on hepatitis E to all passengers to inform
them and to advise that they seek medical advice should they develop
symptoms compatible with hepatitis E. They are also being asked to contact
the HPA directly so that linked cases might be identified.

Hepatitis E is a viral infection that usually produces mild disease with
symptoms of jaundice, dark urine and pale stools with or without nausea,
loss of appetite and/or abdominal pain [1]. In rare cases it can prove
fatal, particularly in pregnant women. Hepatitis E is endemic in many
countries in Asia, Africa and Central America. It is a relatively uncommon
cause of hepatitis in the United Kingdom; 292 cases were reported in 2006
and most of these were associated with travel.

Direct person-to-person spread of hepatitis E is uncommon. Exposure usually
arises from contaminated food or water and can be prevented through good
hygiene, for example:
- drinking bottled water only if it is from a known safe supply and the
bottle is unopened.
- not using ice or eating anything with ice, unless the ice is made from
safe bottled water.
- not eating uncooked fruits or vegetables unless peeled and washed in safe
water.
- not eating foods or beverages from street vendors.

The HPA asks health professionals to ensure that any patients with symptoms
compatible with hepatitis E are tested. Samples (10ml EDTA whole blood)
should be sent to the Virus Reference Department (VRD), HPA Centre for
Infections, 61 Colindale Avenue, London, NW9, 5HT [2]. Enquiries should be
directed to email address: <zoonoses@hpa.org.uk>

[The following abstract from a publication by IK Mushahwar in the current
(April 2008) issue of the Journal of Medical Virology [2008; 80(4): 646-58]
provides a useful account of hepatitis E virus and its epidemiology:

"Hepatitis E virus (HEV), the sole member of the genus _Hepevirus_ in the
family _Hepeviridae_, is the major cause of several outbreaks of waterborne
hepatitis in tropical and subtropical countries and of sporadic cases of
viral hepatitis in endemic and industrialized countries. Transmission of
HEV occurs predominantly by the fecal-oral route although parenteral and
perinatal routes have been implicated. The overall death rate among young
adults and pregnant women is 0.5-3 per cent and 15-20 per cent, respectively.

"HEV is a small non-enveloped particle that consists of a polyadenylated
single-strand RNA molecule containing 3 discontinuous and partially
overlapping open reading frames. There are 4 major genotypes of HEV and a
single serotype. At present, there are approximately 1600 sequences of HEV
that are already available at INSDC of both human and animal isolates.
Diagnostic and molecular assays have been described for the accurate
differentiation of ongoing from remote infection of HEV.

"Identification and characterization of swine HEV in the United States,
Japan, and many other countries and their close relationship to locally
characterized human HEV found in the same geographic areas prove that HEV
is indeed a zoonotic virus and that domestic swine, wild deer, and boars
are reservoirs of HEV in nature. A cell culture system for the propagation
of the virus has been described, and a very successful phase 2 vaccine
trial has been completed." - Mod.CP]
