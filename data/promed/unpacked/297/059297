The Centre for veterinary and agrochemical research (CODA) has found out that the 5th brucellosis outbreak in cattle in the province Namen [Namur] is, different from previous outbreaks, caused by _Brucella suis_ biovar 2. The previous 4 outbreaks were caused by _B. abortus_.

_B. suis_ biovar 2 is a becterium that occurs in wild fauna, especially wild boar. Cattle are regarded as incidental, exceptional hosts. There are rather few literature publication on such incidents.

The Food Agency has urgently sought the opinion of experts about the risk of _B. suis_ infection among cattle. They pointed out that the risk of infection between the animals could not be ruled out, in view of the large number of bacteria that was found in the infected animal, reflecting reproductive disorders. The measures undertaken in in-contact farms will have to be revisited, taking into consideration the opinion obtained and the results of the initial on-farm investigation.

According to prevailing legislation, this sort of brucellosis is included in the list of diseases which are reportable to the OIE. The European and Belgian laws on the control of brucellosis are applicable as well.

In view of the fact that the 5th outbreak has been caused by a different pathogen than the previous 4 outbreaks, it is not linked to any of them, epidemiologically.

[In a subsequent press release, dated 18 May 2012, an additional [6th] outbreak of Brucellosis was recorded on a cattle farm with 85 animals in the Namen province. Since this farm was included among those which have been in contact with the 1st outbreak, it may be assumed that the 6th focus is a _B. abortus_ case, similar to the first 4 outbreaks, and different from the 5th farm - in Florennes - which was found on 2 May infected with _B. suis_ serovar 2.

In the 6th farm, a cow reacted positive in a serological test, was slaughtered and sampled for bacteriological investigation on 10 May, initially found positive by the laboratory on 18 May. The final laboratory result, addressing the exact identity of the pathogen, is expected to be completed early this week.

The pathogenicity for humans of _B. suis_ biovars 1, 3 and 4 is well established, whereas _B. suis_ biovar 2 seems to be less pathogenic. Although hunters and pig farmers have repeatedly been exposed to _B. suis_ biovar 2 (found in wild boar and outdoor-reared pigs in Europe), isolation of _B. suis_ biovar 2 from human samples has seldom been reported.

While the _B.suis_ seems to be endemic, circulating within the local wild boar population, the _B. abortus_ outbreaks may have been introduced by imported animals. Results of the investigations undertaken are anticipated with interest.- Mod.AS]
