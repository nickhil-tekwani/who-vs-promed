The parasite that causes river blindness appears to be developing
resistance to the only drug widely available to treat it, researchers
said on Thursday [19 Jul 2007]. They said their findings raise
concerns of a resurgence of a disease that has been effectively
controlled in many parts of Africa. River blindness, or
onchocerciasis, is an eye and skin disease caused by the filaria
worm. It is transmitted to humans by blackflies breeding along
fast-flowing tropical rivers and streams.
In humans, the adult female worm produces thousands of baby or larval
worms that spread throughout the body, causing skin lesions and
blindness. The disease affects 18 million people worldwide. It has
been controlled for nearly 2 decades through annual doses of a drug
developed by Merck & Co. called ivermectin, or Mectizan, which also
treats the severe skin itching caused by the disease.
Researchers at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, writing in the
journal The Lancet, report that the parasite is starting to resist
treatment with ivermectin. "Because it doesn't eliminate the
parasite, it requires treatment at least every year, and that doesn't
get rid of it. It just reduces transmission," said Roger Prichard of
the Institute of Parasitology, who led the study. "With resistance,
that breaks down, and we expect to see the disease becoming a problem
again," he said.
Prichard and colleagues studied 2501 people in 20 communities in
Ghana, West Africa. They found infection remained common despite
annual treatments.
The researchers also studied skin samples from 342 people in 10
communities who had tested positive before treatment and at 90 and
180 days after treatment. Although the drug cleared 100 percent of
the worm larvae in 99 percent of those treated, they found
significant repopulation of the larvae in 4 out of 10 communities
after 90 days. "In some communities, we were seeing relatively rapid
repopulation, which is not what you should see," Prichard said in a
telephone interview. "Just knowing there is the development of
resistance is important because it gives a bit of a spur to efforts
to fast-track alternative approaches," he said.
A Wyeth drug for heartworm in dogs called moxidectin is in Phase II
clinical trials in humans, but Prichard said the drug is in the same
chemical family as ivermectin, which may hurt its chances at treating
resistant parasites. Dr. Peter Hotez of George Washington University
said the development of resistance highlights the risks of having
only one drug in the toolbox. "This finding represents a wake-up call
that any parasite control program that relies on a single
antimicrobial agent is always at risk of derailment," Hotez wrote in
a commentary.

[The report refers to the following paper in the Lancet:
Osei-Atweneboana MY, Eng JK, Boakye DA, Gyapong JO, Prichard RK.
Prevalence and intensity of _Onchocerca volvulus_ infection and
efficacy of ivermectin in endemic communities in Ghana: a two-phase
epidemiological study. Lancet 2007;369:2021-9.
Ivermection has been a safe and efficient drug for control of
onchocerciasis for more than 2 decades. Ivermectin belongs to the
macrocyclic lactone family of anthelmintics and works by blocking
ligand-gated chloride channels, like the glutamate and GABA channels.
Changes in the amino acid sequence and expression of these channels
may cause resistance to the macrocyclic lactones in laboratory
models, and there is no reason to believe that _Ochocerca volvulus_
is different. The extended use of ivermectin in mass treatment
programs over many years should be expected to result in the
development of resistance, and what is more surprising is that it has
taken so many years. - Mod.EP
