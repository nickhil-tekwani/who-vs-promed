ISLAMABAD: The World Health Organization (WHO) and the epidemic
investigation cell of the National Institute of Health (NIH) have
warned of a cholera outbreak in the flood-affected areas of
Rawalpindi.
The warning was sounded after an initial health assessment of the
flood-hit areas. They put the authorities concerned on high alert to
tackle any possible spread of cholera, a WHO handout said. A team,
comprising WHO medical officer, epidemiologist and epidemic experts
from the NIH, visited the area in the epidemic investigation mobile
laboratory. The team thoroughly analysed the living conditions of the
people affected by the floods in Nullah Leh.
The team, which visited New Katarian, Pirwadhai, Gawalmandi and other
areas, collected samples of drinking water for laboratory
investigation. Chlorine tablets were also distributed among the
people. They were educated about the proper usage of chlorine tablets
and the importance of boiled water.
The Disease Early Warning System (DEWS) -- a joint WHO-NIH venture --
was also activated in the area. The system enables the authorities to
foretell the outbreak of any epidemic. Under this system, a
considerable supply of relevant medicines had already been dispatched
to different hospitals to tackle epidemics like cholera.
Cases of suspected cholera have been reported at the Rawalpindi
hospitals, where a large number of patients of diarrhoea and dysentery
are also being brought, medical sources said.
"At least 3 cases of suspected cholera have been reported at the
District Headquarters Hospital, and we have started treating them as
clinical cholera," the DHQ medical superintendent, Dr Zubair Hassan,
said.
The district health officer, Dr Abid Shah, confirmed the existence of
cholera, but denied that there was any danger of cholera epidemic.
"The disease is presently in endemic form," he said. He said
gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, and dysentery situation was poor and might
become an epidemic. On average each of the 3 public hospitals is
receiving 30 adults and more than 50 paediatric cases of
gastroenteritis, a survey of the hospitals by Dawn revealed. A large
number of such cases go undocumented because the problem is generally
not taken seriously by the people and is treated at home.

[Regardless of whether this is an epidemic or merely an ´outbreak´,
the remarkable thing is that the police & health department are
speaking publicly about cholera in the country. Pakistan has not
reported a single case of cholera to WHO in years, although the
disease in endemic there. - Mod.JW
