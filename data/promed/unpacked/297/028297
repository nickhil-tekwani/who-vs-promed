Indonesia: A New Suspected Human Case of Avian Influenza; Another Not Confirmed
-----------------------------------------------
An Indonesian man suffering symptoms of avian influenza died Monday
[2 Jan 2006], as tests on another man suspected of being the
country's 12th fatality from the virus showed he was not infected,
health officials said.
A 39-year-old man died after being treated for a day at Jakarta's
Sulianti Saroso hospital for infectious disease, Indonesia's main
bird flu treatment center, hospital spokesman Ilham Patu said. Tests
were being carried out to determine whether he died of bird flu, he
said. If confirmed, the man would be Indonesia's 12th fatality from
the H5N1 virus, which has killed at least 70 people across Asia since
2003. "The patient is a suspected bird flu case. He had a history of
contact with live and dead chickens," Patu said. The patient had been
transferred on Sunday [1 Jan 2006] from an international hospital
south of the capital. He was from Tangerang in Banten province, a
town southwest of Jakarta where there have been bird flu outbreaks.
Meanwhile, Hariyadi Wibisono, a top health ministry official, told
AFP that test results had shown that a 48-year-old man from Central
Java who died last week [final week December 2005] suffering bird-flu
like symptoms was not infected as had been suspected.
Scientists warn that continued contact between infected birds and
humans may eventually result in the virus mutating into a form that
could be easily passed on by humans, sparking a pandemic with a
potential toll of millions. Indonesia, the world's 4th most populous
nation, was accused of covering up initial outbreaks of bird flu.
Most victims in the archipelago nation have so far hailed from
densely populated Jakarta and its surrounds, where many people live
in close proximity to poultry, providing ideal conditions for the
virus to pass to humans.

[The confirmed human case count in Indonesia remains at 16 cases and
11 deaths. The deletion of one suspected fatal case and the addition
of another as yet unconfirmed fatal case means that the total number
of suspected human cases remains 17 with 12 deaths. - Mod.CP]
