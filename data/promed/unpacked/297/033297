Fungicide resistance threat to Australian wheat crops
-----------------------------------------------------
Australian wheat crops are under attack from a potentially debilitating fungal disease, which has developed resistance to some of the most common fungicides. The [New South Wales] Department of Primary Industries (DPI) and Charles Sturt University (CSU) have identified fungicide resistant septoria tritici blotch (STB) in a number of crops.

DPI's Dr Andrew Milgate said this is the 1st record of a wheat pathogen developing fungicide resistance in Australia. "Septoria tritici blotch is a serious disease of wheat found in all the major wheat growing regions of the world. In Australia, the prevalence had been low due to prolonged drought, however, we saw a rise in outbreaks in 2011 with improved rainfall."

"We found that STB samples collected since 2011 had developed reduced sensitivity to a number of azole fungicides. We also confirmed that these changes in the Australian population were the same as in the UK and Europe." He said in Europe and the UK, STB has evolved high levels of resistance to many fungicides. DPI and CSU [are working to] identify the strains.

"Growers may not be aware of a significant change because the loss of sensitivity occurs slowly over a number of seasons, with the pathogen gradually becoming more resistant," Dr Milgate said. "Our options for controlling this disease must change rapidly and we are encouraging growers to recognise the potential impact of STB."

[Cereal diseases of the septoria complex are caused by the fungi _Mycosphaerella graminicola_ (previously _Septoria tritici_) and _Phaeosphaeria nodorum_ (previously _Stagonospora nodorum_). They affect mainly wheat, but also barley and oats and occasionally rye and some grass species. Symptoms on wheat and barley are very similar and may occur at any time during the growth of the plant and on any portion of the plant. They include blotches on both leaves and glumes which reduce the photosynthetic ability of the host. Up to 50 percent yield losses have been reported on susceptible varieties. Septoria is considered the most important foliar disease of winter wheat in the UK and other parts of Europe.

Spores can be spread by infected plant material, wind, water (rain splash), and mechanical means. The pathogens can overwinter on crop debris and on autumn sown crops or volunteers. Disease management includes fungicide treatments aimed at preventing the disease
becoming established on the upper 3 leaves of the crop canopy, removal of inoculum sources, and use of resistant varieties.
