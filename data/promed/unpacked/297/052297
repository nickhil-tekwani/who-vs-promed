[1] AstraZeneca: Vaccine needs additional study
Date: Thu 26 Nov 2020

AstraZeneca might have to run an additional global trial to assess the efficacy of its COVID-19 vaccine after concerns were raised about the effectiveness of its jab.

The British company's chief executive Pascal Soriot was quoted as saying in a Bloomberg News report on Thursday [26 Nov 2020] that an additional study would be run to evaluate a lower dosage that performed better than a full amount in AstraZeneca's studies. "Now that we've found what looks like a better efficacy, we have to validate this, so we need to do an additional study," Soriot was quoted as saying.

Soriot said it would probably be another "international study, but this one could be faster because we know the efficacy is high, so we need a smaller number of patients."

The news comes as AstraZeneca, which is working with the University of Oxford, has faced questions about its success rate. Some experts have said it could hinder its chances of getting speedy approval by regulators in the USA and European Union.

Several scientists have raised doubts about the robustness of results released on Monday [23 Nov 2020] showing the experimental vaccine was 90% effective in a sub-group of trial participants who, initially by error, received a half-dose followed by a full dose.

Soriot said he did not expect the additional trial to delay United Kingdom and European regulatory approvals.

On Friday [20 Nov 2020], Britain's Health Minister Matt Hancock said the UK government had requested the regulator to assess the vaccine and hoped to begin the inoculation programme before Christmas.

"We have formally asked the regulator to assess the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, to understand the data and determine whether it meets rigorous safety standards," Hancock said in a statement. "This letter is an important step towards deploying a vaccine as quickly and as safely as possible."

Earlier Soriot said while authorisation was likely to come from some countries before the end of the year [2020], clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could take longer because the agency was unlikely to approve the vaccine based on studies carried out elsewhere, especially given the questions about the results.

AstraZeneca research chief Mene Pangalos told Reuters on Monday [23 Nov 2020] that researchers had stumbled upon the half-dose regime by accident, saying a sub-group of the trial was given a smaller initial dose by mistake. Earlier he had said that the firm would start discussions with the FDA to change the design of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine trial to add the more-effective dosage [regimen].

While this could constitute a setback for the UK company, Chris Smith, consultant virologist with Cambridge University, said the error could actually turn out in favour of AstraZeneca.

"What they found...was that they had one group of individuals who had a 90%-plus response rate to their vaccine, and another group that responded a bit less well, down 60% or 70%," Smith told Al Jazeera. "Then, by analysing the data, they have found that individuals who got a smaller amount first and then a bigger dose next, actually responded better than people who got 2 higher doses," he said.

"If that turns out to be the case, then the 100 million doses of the vaccine that the UK has already purchased from AstraZeneca, instead of treating half of the population, will provide enough coverage to go through the entire population," Smith added.

Meanwhile on the same day [23 Nov 2020], the British government's Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance said that the main point about the AstraZeneca vaccine against COVID-19 was that it worked, when asked about doubts that have been raised about the vaccine. "The headline result is the vaccine works and that's very exciting," Vallance said during a news conference with Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

Chief Medical Adviser Chris Whitty, answering the same question, said there was always scientific debate about virtually everything. "The key thing from our point of view is to leave this in the hands of the regulator.... They will make an assessment with lots of data that [are] not currently in the public domain on efficacy and on safety," Whitty said.

[Why am I not feeling as comfortable with this vaccine until more data are available for review? Licensure for a vaccine that is found to be 90% efficacious (small numbers) by mistake isn't very confidence inspiring. My questions deal with why a lower prime dose works better than a full dose. As suggested by an esteemed colleague, could a higher dose have immunized against the vector virus (chimpanzee adenovirus) so the 2nd dose is negated in some individuals due to an immune response against the vector virus?

It's difficult to pass judgment on information provided in media announcements without having access to the actual data. For example, the initial report did not state that it was an "accidental finding" (the increased efficacy associated with a half-dose primer). The last sentence in the above report states, "They will make an assessment with lots of data that [are] not currently in the public domain on efficacy and on safety."

[2] China (Beijing): Market suspension of frozen and aquatic foods
[A]

The Xinfadi wholesale market in Beijing, which was previously hit by COVID-19, has suspended the storage and sale of frozen and aquatic products, the market said Wednesday [25 Nov 2020].

The move follows reports of COVID-19 infections related to imported frozen products in multiple Chinese provinces and municipalities in recent months.

All frozen and aquatic products have been removed from the market's refrigerated warehouses, which have had their electricity supplies cut and undergone disinfection, according to the market.

The measures will not affect Xinfadi's fresh pork trade, and market authorities have registered and conducted checks on all the warehouses and cold-storage facilities for fruits and vegetables.

Xinfadi market is Beijing's largest vegetable wholesale market. It was temporarily shut down due to a resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic in June [2020]. The vegetable wholesale area reopened on 6 Sep 2020, marking the full resumption of business at the market in the wake of the closure.

The market provided about 70% of Beijing's vegetables, 10% of its pork and 3% of its beef and mutton before being shut down on 13 Jun 2020. Starting on 11 Jun 2020, Beijing reported 335 confirmed COVID-19 cases linked to a cluster from the Xinfadi wholesale market.

The Chinese mainland on Tuesday [24 Nov 2020] reported no new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases, the National Health Commission said Wednesday [25 Nov 2020].

Watch out for a highly possible new transmission route of the novel coronavirus -- cold-chain transportation.

After several months of analysis, Chinese researchers have concluded that imported food via cold chain from high-risk areas overseas may be the origin of the unexpected COVID-19 resurgence in Beijing in June [2020], which started from the city's largest wholesale market Xinfadi.

The study, jointly conducted by several institutions, including Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College and Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Science, was published in the medical journal National Science Review last week [23 Oct 2020].

The finding is particularly important for countries where community transmissions are contained or suppressed, the authors wrote, warning that the virus could be reintroduced via cold-chain transportation of contaminated items and initiate an outbreak.

They also suggest the regular surveillance of cold-chain imported products, especially those from epidemic regions for the COVID-19.

[ProMED covered the outbreak in Beijing mentioned in the above reports (see COVID-19 update (358): New Zealand, China contaminated imported food, WHO, global 20200814.7676661; COVID-19 update (264): China (Beijing), dexamethasone, WHO, global 20200617.7477998; COVID-19 update (262): China (Beijing), superspreaders, WHO, global 20200616.7473860; COVID-19 update (260): China (Beijing) South Africa, WHO, global 20200615.7469624). The conclusion that aquatic and frozen foods are responsible for the recent outbreaks of cases is a bit disconcerting. Observationally, several outbreaks in China were associated with markets that dealt in seafood.

In the article referenced in [B], Pang et al. (1) detail the investigation of the "index case" -- a 52-year-old male who was the 1st case reported in Beijing after 56 days with no new cases. No known exposure was identified, so close contacts and environmental samples from places he had visited had qRT-PCR tests. All close contacts were negative, but 2 environmental samples from the Xinfadi market were positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Epidemiologic and laboratory studies after 10 million individuals were tested identified contact with the Xinfadi market. Individuals working in the basement had the highest positivity rates and also had earlier dates of onset than employees working elsewhere in the market. A total of 14 booths in the market were linked to employee infections and positive environmental samples, and 5 visitors to one booth were positive for IgG/IgM antibodies. All 7 employees of that booth were positive by qRT-PCR and antibody tests. Virus sequencing of 72 samples found all had the same 8 mutations.

Environmental sampling identified the same virus in 5 samples of fish from company X, which supplied the fish to the implicated booth on 30 May 2020, the day the visitors gave as when they were at this booth. The authors speculated "that the COVID-19 resurgence in Beijing was likely to be initiated by an environment-to-human transmission originated from contaminated imported food via cold-chain logistics." They do qualify their speculation as to the unclarity as to whether the viral load on the salmon was sufficient to establish an infection.

Clearly, based on these findings, the Chinese government is shutting down aquatic foods and frozen food distribution at the implicated market. What is unclear is whether it is a temporary shutdown until the storage warehouses can be decontaminated or if this will be of longer duration until more definitive studies on the role of aquatic and frozen food on disease transmission are conducted. - Mod.MPP

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218 (Samoa has not been added).

Data by country, area, or territory for 27 Nov 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesNov27_1606514245.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 21.0% of daily case numbers and 25.4% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours and maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 25.5 million cases. The USA did not report any cases to WHO today (27 Nov 2020). That leaves the dominant country today as Brazil, followed by Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and Canada. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases include Peru, Panama, Chile, Costa Rica, and the Dominican Republic. And countries/territories reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Paraguay, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Puerto Rico.

- The European region reported 55.3% of daily case numbers and 55.4% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 18.0 million. Countries not reporting cases today (27 Nov 2020) include Sweden and Kazakhstan, among others. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Italy, Russia, Germany, UK, Poland, Ukraine, and France. There are 24 additional countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours and 5 countries reporting more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 8.5% of daily case numbers and 9.3% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.97 million cases. Iran is dominant, with continuing record-breaking highs, followed by Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, Iraq, Palestinian Authority, Lebanon, UAE, and Tunisia. Libya reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Oman has not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.6% of daily case numbers and 1.5% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.47 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, followed by Algeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Nigeria, Mozambique, Namibia, Congo (Brazzaville), Zimbabwe, and DR Congo (Kinshasa).

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.2% of daily case numbers and 0.69% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.86 million cases. Japan is dominant, followed by Philippines, Malaysia, South Korea, French Polynesia, China, Guam, Mongolia, and Australia.

- The South East Asia region reported 12.3% of the daily newly reported cases and 7.7% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 10.6 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and Thailand.

Impression: The absence of reports from the USA is a significant change in reported cases, giving a false impression of decreased transmission globally. Repeating from yesterday's (26 Nov 2020) comment, the USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases on a daily basis (when reporting), as transmission continues uncontrolled and is expected to increase following the Thanksgiving holiday weekend (26 Nov 2020 was Thanksgiving Day).

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 27 Nov 2020, is an excellent visual representation of the pandemic. - Mod.MPP]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (205 578), Turkey (44 506), India (41 353), and Brazil (33 780) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 11 307 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (26-27 Nov 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (14 countries) include the USA, Turkey, India, Brazil, Italy (28 342), Russia (27 543), Germany (22 018), Poland (17 304), Ukraine (16 218), UK (14 739), Iran (14 051), France (12 459), Mexico (12 081), and Colombia (10 023). A total of 64 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 33 of the 64 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 9 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 3 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 2.1%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 4.4%. In the USA, the 7-day averages for newly confirmed cases are increased by 9.5% and the daily reported deaths are increased by 4.2% (4 states reported more than 15 000 cases in the past 24 hours -- a reminder that yesterday [26 Nov 2020], 23 of 62 reporting units did not report, and while there were reports today [27 Nov 2020], the holiday weekend decreases in reporting may be in play here).

Impression: The global daily reported cases seem to be leveling off. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. The USA continues to show uncontrolled transmission. - Mod.MPP]
