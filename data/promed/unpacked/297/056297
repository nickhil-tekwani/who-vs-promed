A youth of 24 years who worked in a logging area in the insular zone
died in a local hospital of [a] hantavirus [infection] after having
contracted this serious disease. This disease is transmitted by a
variety of wild rats and the municipal sub secretary of Health, Favio
Crudo, provided information related to the preventive measures, which
must be taken. The official said that the victim died in the Virgin
del Carmen local hospital, where he had been admitted on 20 Feb 2010.
The physician emphasized that the diagnosis of the disease was positive.

The official explained that, "usually, between the months of February
and April, cases of hantavirus [infections] are expected, due to
climatic characteristics -- high humidity, rain, and an increase in
the rodent population." He further noted, "since last month [February
2010], some cases in the region also occurred."

Hantaviruses are present in 3 specific areas in the country. One is
the Patagonia region, in cities such as El Bolson, where the Andes
[virus] species is present. The Oran [hantavirus] variety [species]
is located around the Salta [province] locality of Oran, which also
affects Jujuy province. "In our area, comprised of northern Buenos
Aires and Santa Fe [provinces] there is Lechiguana virus, transmitted
by 2 species of mice that are not exactly the domestic kind, rather
are wild and known as _ Oligoryzomys flavescens_, [yellow pygmy rice
rat] and _Akodon azarae_ [Azara's grass mouse]. However, Crudo
explained that under certain circumstances these species can come
into dwellings, for which extreme preventive measures must be taken,
[such as] removing vegetation 30 m [approx 100 ft] around houses, not
leaving food within reach of rodents, taking care when giving food to
pets (it has not been shown that dogs and cats transmit hantaviruses).

One of the main problems that uninhabited dwellings present is when
they are reopened after a long time. They must first be well
ventilated and then the floors sprayed with water and bleach;
especially recommended is not to sweep but to flush with water in
order to avoid breathing rodent excreta, which contains the virus.

[As indicated in ProMED-mail archive no. 20060822.2370, hantaviruses
in South America are maintained in sigmodontine rodents. Several
hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina:
Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat
host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), related Andes-like viruses
Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown), Lechiguana (in
central Argentina in _O. flavescens_), Oran (in northwestern
Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_), and Bermejo (western Argentina in
_O. flavescens_) virus. Other hantaviruses are present in various
South American countries and in Panama (see Mod. CP comments in
ProMED-mail archive number 20060220.0553).

The CDC has an excellent Power Point presentation on hantaviruses available at
