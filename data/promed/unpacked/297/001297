SWITZERLAND: concerns over harmful nitrofuran found in food
-----------------------------------------------------------
Traces of the antibiotic nitrofuran, which is thought to cause cancer, have
been found in a number of samples of imported poultry and shrimp, according
to the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health.
Forty-three of 121 tested samples of poultry and shrimp imported from Asia
and South America were found to contain levels of nitrofuran above the safe
limit.
Switzerland imposed a safety limit on levels of nitrofuran on 14 August
2002, after traces of the antibiotic were found in poultry imported form
China, reported Swiss News Digest.

GERMANY: Nitrofen scandal causes organic meat sales to dip
----------------------------------------------------------
The Nitrofen scandal has caused a fall in consumer demand for organic foods
in Germany, with the organic meat sector being hit particularly badly. A
new report by industry consultants Organic Monitor shows that sales of
organic meat products are projected to drop by 24 per cent to 482.7 Euros
(US$472.6m) in 2002.
The German market for organic meat products remains the largest in Europe.
However, consumer confidence has weakened since May 2002 when news broke
that tainted organic wheat was fed to poultry at organic farms. This led to
a sharp reduction in organic meat sales with consumer demand for organic
poultry collapsing during the peak of the crisis. Organic Monitor projects
that organic poultry revenues will fall by a half in 2002.
The supermarkets have experienced the sharpest sales decrease with many
retailers withdrawing organic meat products altogether since the scandal.
The loss in consumer confidence has not been as great in the specialist
retailers with many reporting that sales were slowly returning to
pre-scandal levels.
