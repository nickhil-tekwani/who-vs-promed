[1] Georgia: llama, human exposure

Health officials say 4 people in northwest Georgia have been exposed to rabies by a pet llama.

Officials say a veterinarian was called to a house in Morganton on 28 Dec 2012 because a llama was showing signs of aggression, biting at itself and at others and spitting at one of its caretakers. The llama was euthanized and sent to a lab.

Officials say the caretaker the llama spat on is receiving treatment [Presumably, this is post exposure prophylaxis against rabies. - Mod.TG]. Authorities say one person who came into contact with the animal experienced very little exposure and will not need treatment. Officials are waiting to hear from the other 2 people who were exposed to the virus.

[2] Massachusetts: bobcat, human exposure

The bobcat that attacked a Massachusetts man and his nephew had rabies. The Telegram & Gazette (http://bit.ly/11f0LY7) reports that state lab results on the dead animal were announced at Tuesday [8 Jan 2013] night's select board meeting in Brookfield.

Wildlife officials suspected that the bobcat that attacked the man [in his garage] on Sunday [6 Jan 2013] was rabid because of its unusually aggressive behavior. After pouncing on him, sinking its teeth into his face and its claws in his back and holding him in what he described as a bear hug, the animal went outside and bit the 15-year-old boy. The man shot and killed the bobcat.

He, his nephew, and his wife, who was not bitten but got the animal's blood on her, have already started rabies treatments.

The unidentified Gloucester Township family of 2 adults and 2 children found a stray kitten Tuesday [1 Jan 2013] night and tried to nurse it back to health, the officials said in a statement. But the kitten died Wednesday [2 Jan 2013] night, and a township animal control officer who picked it up arranged to have it tested for rabies the next morning.

Test results came back positive on Friday [4 Jan 2013], and officials told the family members they would have to receive rabies prophylaxis shots because of their exposure to the animal.

Two dogs in the house thought to be current with their rabies vaccines will receive prophylaxis treatment as well, officials said. [Generally, animals that are current on their rabies vaccine are revaccinated. - Mod.TG]

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the treatment for humans for exposure to rabies consists of a regimen of one dose of immune globulin and 4 doses of rabies vaccine over 14 days. The vaccines are relatively painless and are given in the arm, like a flu or tetanus vaccine, the CDC said.

"Although rabies is a serious illness, it can be prevented by early treatment," said Freeholder Carmen Rodriguez, liaison to the Camden County Health Department. "If you have been bitten or scratched by an unfamiliar animal, it is important that you seek immediate medical attention."

Rodriguez said residents should report stray animals and not take them in because they could be infected with the disease.

A Lee County official is urging residents of an Auburn community to steer clear of any stray animals and to make sure their pets' vaccinations are up to date after a stray kitten captured there tested positive for rabies.

Lee County Rabies Officer Buddy Bruce said 2 women were bitten and scratched while in the process of trying to capture the kitten in the Town Creek Park area. A 3rd woman who got food for the kitten was also exposed, Bruce said.

After catching the stray kitten, the 2 women took it to the Lee County Humane Society. They said they reported being bitten, at which point the animal was ordered euthanized and tested for rabies. The results came back positive on Wednesday [12 Dec 2012], Bruce said.

Rabies is a contagious, viral and fatal disease transmitted through saliva that attacks the nervous system of the infected animal. While the 1st 2 women have been contacted and will begin treatment, the 3rd victim has yet to be notified of her exposure.

Wednesday's [12 Dec 2012] rabies case marks the 4th in Lee County this year [2012], Bruce said. Last month [November 2012], a Chow-mix dog that was abandoned at an Opelika veterinary clinic tested positive for rabies after biting at least one worker.

The city's Health Department has issued an alert after a confirmed case of rabies in a cat from the area of Weymouth Road and Delsea Drive. On Thursday [6 Dec 2012], a woman brought a sick cat to a local veterinarian's office, where it bit a vet assistant, according to the department. State officials confirmed on Friday [7 Dec 2012] that the cat had rabies, requiring the cat owner and vet staffer to get treatments.

The rabid animal was living in a colony of feral cats fed by the woman, and health officials said they are concerned other felines were exposed to rabies. Vineland's animal control officer ordered the woman to have all the cats licensed, which requires proof of a rabies vaccination.

The cats, estimated to number about 20 kittens and adults, will have to be quarantined for 6 months, according to the health department. The cat owner told officials she would confine the cats to her house.

Residents of the area should keep an eye on their pets and be sure their rabies vaccinations are up-to-date. People also should avoid contact with unfamiliar cats, the health department said.

[When people are exposed to a rabid animal by a bite or scratch or saliva in a wound or mucus membranes, they should have post exposure prophylaxis against rabies. Rabies is a deadly disease, and the numbers of people who have survived it are very, very small, and those that do may not completely return to normal. Prevention is key.

One of the best barriers against rabies is to keep your pets, including horses, llamas, and other livestock, such as calves for show, vaccinated. If you have contact with a domestic animal, it should be vaccinated. Vaccination is cheap life insurance.

Each state can set its own rabies regulations regarding how long to quarantine an animal or other aspects concerning re-vaccination of vaccinated but exposed animals.

It is unusual that, as the last article mentions, a colony of feral cats is being allowed to be quarantined in the woman's home. A colony of feral cats implies that these cats may not be entirely well socialized, and, therefore, may have been exposed to the virus. Furthermore, this article tells us nothing of the ability of this woman to protect herself while feral animals are in her home.
