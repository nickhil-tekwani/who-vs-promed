Pasteurella pneumonia, Big Horn sheep
=====================================

[This report was derived from conversations with Dr Briggs Hall,
Washington State Dept of Fisheries & Wildlife, Olympia, WA,
hallpbh@dfw.wa.gov [being installed] & (360) 902-2515, and Dr Bill
Foreyt, Dept Microbiology & Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine,
WSU, Pullman, WA, wforeyt@vetmed.wsu.edu & (509) 335-6066. Dr David
Hunter was unavailable [(208) 327-7070]. Any errors are mine. MH-J]

The "outbreak" started with a dead Big Horn Sheep being reported on
22nd November, 1995, and later recovered from the bottom of a cliff
from where it was believed to have "fallen off". It was sent to
Washington State University (WSU) for necropsy, where it was found to
have had a Pasturella haemolytica pneumonia.

This was rapidly followed up by a helicopter survey of Big Horn sheep
in the same area and some 22 were noted to be dead and a significant
number sick. Some sick sheep and a feral domestic goat in the same area
were collected and submitted to WSU for confirmation of Ps.haemolytica.
Organisms recovered from the goat's lungs were found to be genetically
identical with Ps.haemolytica in one of the affected sheep.

At this time there were some 70 sheep in the area, many of which were
ill. Some ten miles away were a total of 150 unaffected sheep in
various bands. This area of affected sheep is very close to Idaho and
Oregon and thus they were perceived to present a disease risk to the
surrounding bands; rutting rams are itinerant in their search for ewes,
and sick and dead rams were recovered away from affected ewes and lambs.

The three states coordinate their surveillance activities. It was decided
to cull the "sick" group. However, Dr David Hunter (veterinarian with the
Idaho Fish & Wildlife Dept) had a research project on Big Horn Sheep and
was able to persuade the Foundation for Rocky Mountain Big Horn Sheep to
contribute $25,000 and to obtain helicoper flying time to net and capture
all 72 sheep. On 1st December these sheep were captured without losses,
treated, and trucked to Caldwell in Idaho. None died in transit. The
objective was to treat and return them ASAP to their grazing area.

Everything went well for 16 days and then deaths restarted, preventing
their return. To date, 53 have died of Ps.multocida pneumonia ("feed lot
disease") believed to be as a result of the stress of penning and close
proximity. They also developed clinicical coccidiosis; coccidia are a
normal member of their gut flora. More deaths are expected. Ps.multocida
is a normal inhabitant of the sheeps' lungs. The situation was apparently
exacerbated soon after the deaths restarted by a severe inversion with
temperatures down to 20'F with 100%RH.

While the outbreak of stress related disease has been a lesson, the
other bands appear to have not developed pneumonia as was feared and
continue in normal health.
