9 cases of cutaneous anthrax in Imilchil
----------------------------------------
A medical team in Imilchil (Midelt province [Meknes-Tafilalet region, Morocco]) diagnosed 9 cases of cutaneous anthrax contracted through close contact with cattle affected with the same pathology, said the Ministry of Health on Thursday [27 Aug 2015], adding that "the epidemiological situation is not worrying."

All these cases were taken care of and put under antibiotic treatment, the Ministry said in a statement, noting that the local health and veterinary services have taken steps to contain the epidemic. "This epidemiological situation is not alarming given that cutaneous anthrax is a bacterial disease which can easily be treated [with antibiotics]," said the Department of Health, advising that the Ministry, in coordination with other concerned services, is closely monitoring the situation and will inform the public of its further development.

[Medical services rushed to the places of the epidemic to proceed with the clinical diagnosis of a malignant pustule in 9 patients while veterinary services have posed a presumptive diagnosis of the disease in cattle after determining their epidemiological links with the patients. Investigations conducted on-site also revealed that the cases were individuals who were handling infected carcasses without necessarily consuming their meat.

The event, rare in this region of Morocco, has aroused concern such as the Ministry of Health had to broadcast a statement on the radio to reassure the population.

According to statistics from the National Office for Safety of Food Products [ONSSA], anthrax is sporadically reported in cattle and small ruminants in some areas of the country: an average of 5 foci (35 cases) were reported annually in ruminants during the period 2003-2012 and an average of 292 000 animals (cattle, sheep and goats) have been vaccinated each year between 2005 and 2012 in areas where anthrax is known to occur http://www.onssa.gov.ma/fr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=443&Itemid=470.

Information would be appreciated on ongoing investigations designed to determine the origin of the outbreak and its extent in humans and livestock, as well as information on the emergency vaccination program that will eventually be conducted in the receptive livestock population at risk. - Mod.AB
