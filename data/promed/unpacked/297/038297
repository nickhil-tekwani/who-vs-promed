TUBERCULOSIS IN DEER - ARGENTINA (PATAGONIA) (02)

Since I don't have any particular experience with TB in deer I can not
really comment on the common TB macro findings in this species. The nodules
in the thorax, however, have been described in a variety of species.
But I can definitely assure you that a negative Ziehl-Neelsen stained smear
does not mean the specimen was negative for TB. The vast majority of our
cattle and buffalo specimens are ZN negative although we isolate M. bovis
from them.
