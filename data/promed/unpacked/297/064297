Young infants are particularly at risk of severe illness from whooping cough. Seven babies under the age of 2 months have died this year [2022] in the Western Cape after contracting whooping cough, as health authorities note a marked increase in cases nationally.

Whooping cough (pertussis) is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection caused by a bacteria called _Bordetella pertussis_. Infants are particularly at risk of severe disease as they are too young to be immunised -- the 1st pertussis immunisation dose is usually administered at 6 weeks [of age].

"Through our surveillance system, the Western Cape department of health has picked up a marked increase in pertussis cases," the department said. "Since January [2022], cases have been increasing throughout the country (408), particularly in the Western Cape where we have had 230 cases, most of them since September [2022]. These are laboratory-confirmed cases and probably represent only a small fraction of the true cases in the community.

The NICD is encouraging parents and guardians with children under the age of 5 to ensure they are up-to-date with vaccination and to seek medical advice. People who are not immune to the bacterium through vaccination or previous infection can get pertussis at any age. Infants and children not vaccinated or partially vaccinated are at higher risk of infection as well as those with severe disease or a weakened immune system.

The National Institute for Communicable Diseases noted a steady increase in the number of cases reported since May [2022] and a sharp increase from July [2022].
