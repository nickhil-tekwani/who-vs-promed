Progress of the West Nile virus outbreak
----------------------------------------
I was disappointed with both the attitude and the content in the last West
Nile posting. The number of positive dead birds has doubled in the last
week or two. Mosquito pool positives occurred for the first time in the
last week or two. Positives are rising rapidly despite what would be
considered aggressive larvicidal measures, necessitating the ground
sprayings. Sentinel chickens appear to either be worthless or not
positioned properly. Reported sightings of dead birds have numbered in the
thousands in those areas effected last year, much less (often under 100) in
uninvolved counties in New York state. These numbers, which are most
definitely not small, may be the most significant of all. All states and
counties that had positives last year have now had positives (bird or
mosquito) this year, which was not the case two weeks ago. The situation is
building rapidly, not slowly. Perhaps of even more concern is that endemic
viruses (EEE, SLE) being tested for concurrently are not showing this early
(for mosquito-borne diseases) activity, suggesting it is not related solely
to mosquito numbers.
I agree the posts could get tiresome, particularly if they continue to
quote joggers from Central Park or physicians who "fear" the most
over-diagnosed disease in the Western hemisphere more than an encephalitis
virus introduced into virgin territory. [Indeed, I have been informed by a
ProMED-mail colleague that both deer and Lyme disease-infected ticks have
been found in both Central Park NYC and Hyde Park, London. - Mod.CP. Such
material should be left on the pages of the New York Times.

Sentinel ducks
--------------
I understand the need to limit West Nile Virus coverage until there is
something new to cover, but one area I'd like to keep open for discussion
is the possibility of using sentinel ducks instead of chickens. As was
reported from the Bronx Zoo(?), ducks seroconvert more readily and can hold
more of the virus without dying, hence these birds are seemingly better
suited to this function. In addition, ducks habitats include the kinds of
ponds in which mosquitoes breed. Ducks are more sedentary, and hence
would be easier targets for mosquitoes. Ducks can be easily captured for
examination with a handful of grain and a simple shepherd's crook, and
ducks do not require confinement. They will pretty much hang out where you
put them if there is water and the occasional handful of mash. It may even
be possible to band and monitor ducks that already reside in the suspected
areas.

Potential of _Culex restuans_ for transmission of West Nile virus
---------------------------------------------------------------
The detection of West Nile (WN) virus activity in crows earlier this
summer, before _Culex pipiens_ should have been active in large numbers,
raised the question of the potential for _Culex restuans_ to transmit WN
virus by bite. The recent detection of WN virus in _Cx. restuans_
mosquitoes from Connecticut by Dr. Anderson further raises this question.
As part of our evaluation of potential vectors of WN virus we tested both
_Cx. restuans_ and _Cx. pipiens_. Although our data for _Cx. restuans_ is
preliminary, in the laboratory it appears very similar to _Cx. pipiens_ in
its ability to transmit WN virus (i.e., it is a moderately efficient
vector). HOWEVER, the ability to transmit a virus in the laboratory is just
one factor in determining its vectorial capacity. Of greater importance are
host-feeding preference, population density, and survival relative to the
extrinsic incubation period.
I read with interest a ProMED-mail report yesterday that stated that "The
bird virus [West Nile virus that killed seven New Yorkers last year has
now spread all over the Americas..." To the best of my knowledge, there has
not been any indication that this virus has spread this year beyond the New
York, New Jersey, Connecticut area. Similarly, there is no evidence that
the virus came into the US in a bird from Israel. Likewise, there is
considerable evidence that the virus responsible for the current outbreak
is distinct from the one used in the 1950's studies at the Sloan-Kettering
Institute in New York.
