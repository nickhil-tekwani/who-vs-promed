Sagar taluk [Shimoga district] is reeling under a fresh outbreak of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, as 3 persons hailing from here have died because of this tick-borne viral infection in just 3 days. On [Sun 3 Mar 2019], [SP], 58, a resident of Nandodi from Aralagod gram panchayat [GP] in Sagar taluk, died at a private hospital in Manipal. With this, the KFD death toll in the district since December [2018] has touched 12. According to sources in the Department of Health and Family Welfare, 6 persons suffering from symptoms of KFD in Aralagod GP limits have been admitted in various private hospitals since [Sat 2 Mar 2019]. 2 of them are said to be in serious condition.

Of the recent 3 victims, [P], who died on [Sat 2 Mar 2019], and [S] had been administered primary as well as a booster dose of vaccine against KFD. An officer serving with the department told The Hindu on the condition of anonymity that the deaths of vaccinated persons has created apprehension about the potency of the vaccine. The issue will be brought to the notice of the authorities at the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals, Bengaluru, where the vaccine is produced, the officer said. So far, more than 90 000 persons from affected areas spread over Sagar, Tirthahalli, Hosanagar, Sorab, Shikaripur, and Bhadravati taluks have been administered primary and booster dose of the vaccine. The booster dose will offer around 65 percent immunity against the disease. The immunity level in the vaccinated person will be enhance to 83 percent after a third round of vaccination, usually administered nine months after the booster dose.

Following the fresh outbreak, vigilance has been stepped up in Aralagod and surrounding areas. Staff from the Forest and Health and Family Welfare departments are combing forests to find dead monkeys. Dimethyl phthalate (DMP), a tick-repellent oil, is also being provided for the residents in Aralagod through Accredited Social Health Activists.

[According to the news report in [1] above, new cases have been reported from the Sagar areas of Shimoga district in Karnataka state, bringing the death toll to 12 since December 2018.

The disease typically occurs during the dry season from November through May and is linked to increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Various risk factors for KFDV infections include exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings with herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters at increased risk of contracting the disease.

Use of personal protective measures against tick bites and vaccination of high risk groups remains the key interventions to prevent KFD. The news report also brings in to question the efficacy of the available KFD vaccine as at least 2 of the fatal cases had a history of prior vaccination - Mod.UBA
