Ciprofloxacin resistance may be tied to increased gonorrhea incidence, according to a report published in the April [2014] issue of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Emerging Infectious Diseases [1].

Harrell W. Chesson, Ph.D., from the CDC in Atlanta, and colleagues analyzed ciprofloxacin resistance data and gonorrhea incidence data to examine the possible effect of antimicrobial drug resistance on gonorrhea incidence at the population level. The authors utilized the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project [GISP] as well as city-level gonorrhea incidence rates from surveillance data for 17 cities from 1991 to 2006.

The researchers found that there was a strong positive association between ciprofloxacin resistance and gonorrhea incidence rates at the city level during the study period. This association was consistent with mathematical model predictions in which resistance to treatment can increase gonorrhea incidence rates through increased duration of infection.

"These findings highlight the possibility of future increases in gonorrhea incidence caused by emerging cephalosporin resistance," the authors write.

[_Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ has successively become resistant to penicillin, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin) after each was introduced for treatment of gonorrhea. Ciprofloxacin-resistant gonococcal strains became increasingly prevalent in the US during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Because of widespread resistance, the CDC recommended that ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones no longer be used for treatment of gonorrhea in 2007, which resulted in the availability of only the cephalosporins ceftriaxone and cefixime that met CDC's efficacy standards. More recently, as a result of declining susceptibility to cefixime, the CDC recommended dual therapy with intramuscular ceftriaxone combined with either oral azithromycin or doxycycline as the only recommended 1st-line treatment option for uncomplicated urogenital, anorectal, and pharyngeal gonococcal disease (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm).

Combination therapy using 2 antimicrobials with different mechanisms of action is being recommended to improve treatment efficacy and potentially delay emergence and spread of resistance to ceftriaxone because of experience with other microbes that have developed antimicrobial resistance rapidly.

The use of a single dose of azithromycin as the 2nd antimicrobial is preferred to that of doxycycline orally twice daily for 7 days because of the convenience and compliance advantages of single-dose therapy and the substantially higher prevalence of gonococcal resistance to tetracycline than to azithromycin, particularly in strains with elevated cefixime minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm).

During 1975-1997, the national gonorrhea rate declined 74 percent after implementation of the national gonorrhea control program in the mid-1970s. After the decline halted for several years, gonorrhea rates decreased further to 98.1 cases per 100 000 population in 2009. This was the lowest rate since recording of gonorrhea rates began. Since 2009, the rate has increased slightly each year, to 100.2 in 2010, 103.3 in 2011, and to 107.5 cases per 100 000 population in 2012, with a total of 334 826 cases reported in the United States in 2012 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats12/gonorrhea.htm).

The study referred to in the news release above found that although gonorrhea incidence rates were much lower overall in higher ciprofloxacin-resistance US cities, gonorrhea incidence rates generally increased in the higher resistance cities and decreased in the lower resistance cities during 2000-2006 (http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2004.131288). Although an association cannot establish causality, the investigators postulate treatment failures or delays in clearance of gonococcal infections caused by ciprofloxacin resistance might have increased the duration of infectivity and thereby facilitated transmission to partners. Another possible explanation might be mutational changes in the organism that conferred resistance or co-occurred with resistance determinants might have provided a fitness benefit that supported transmission (http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2004.131288). - Mod.ML]
