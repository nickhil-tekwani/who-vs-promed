A 2nd interior Alaska wolf has tested positive for rabies, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game announced on Thursday [2 May 2013]. A trapper captured the wolf on 15 Mar 2013 near Chandalar Lake near the foothills of the Brooks range about 185 miles [about 296 km] north of Fairbanks, the same general location as a rabid wolf shot last month [April 2013]. The trapper killed the wolf, skinned it, and fed raw meat from the carcass to his dog team, said spokeswoman Cathie Harms. The 5 dogs are in quarantine in Fairbanks.

The dogs had been vaccinated for rabies but will be given booster shots, the department said.

Rabies is regularly detected in Arctic foxes along Alaska's west and north coasts but had not been found south of the Brooks Range since statehood in 1959, the department said.

"We're still trying to get a clearer picture of the current situation, especially in wolves in the Chandalar Lake area," Dr Kimberlee Beckmen, a department veterinarian, said in the announcement. "We'd really like to hear from the people who have seen wolves or other wildlife acting abnormally in that area. Abnormal behavior can also be caused by diseases other than rabies, such as distemper, so a test of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis of the disease."

Both rabid wolves exhibited abnormal behavior when they were killed. Wolves normally are shy, but a trapper who shot the wolf last month [April 2013] said the animal had closely approached him.

The trapper, a man who lives near Palmer, took the animal home with him and cut himself while skinning it. Worried that the animal may have been infected, he sent the head in for testing and discarded the rest of the carcass in a wooded area.

When the department confirmed rabies, which can be spread to other animals that eat nerve tissue such as brains or spinal cords, the carcass was retrieved. The carcass had been scavenged, but the spinal cord had not been disturbed, officials said.

The wolf caught in a leg trap on 15 Mar 2013 was alive when the trapper approached but appeared dull and unaware, the department said. The trapper killed the animal, skinned it, and fed the raw meat to his dogs. Beckman said they should not have been fed the carcass.

"It's very dangerous to feed raw carcasses of wildlife, especially carnivores, to pets," Beckmen said. "Pets can not only become infected, they can then transmit diseases and parasites to their owners, rabies, tularemia and echinococcus being the most serious."

Rabies had not been diagnosed in the region in 54 years of statehood, but archived territorial reports document cases of rabies in foxes and dogs in interior Alaska, the department said. Beckmen said she's looking for more samples from the heads of wolves, wolverines, foxes, or coyotes killed near the Chandalar Lakes or Fortymile River areas.

Rabies has been detected over the winter along the north and west coasts, and more cases are expected in the arctic fox and red fox populations. Village dogs, the department said, are vulnerable to infection from foxes. Alaska health officials warn trappers and hunters to wear gloves when skinning animals, wash wounds with soap and water, wash knives after cutting off heads, and avoid cutting into brains or spinal cords.

[Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by infection with tiny tapeworms of the genus _Echinocococcus_. Echinococcosis is classified as either cystic echinococcosis or alveolar echinococcosis.

Cystic echinocccosis (CE), also known as hydatid disease, is caused by infection with the larval stage of _Echinococcus granulosus_, a tapeworm about 2-7 millimeters long found in dogs (definitive host) and sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs (intermediate hosts). Although most infections in humans are asymptomatic, CE causes harmful, slowly enlarging cysts in the liver, lungs, and other organs that often grow unnoticed and neglected for years.

Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) disease is caused by infection with the larval stage of _Echinococcus multilocularis_, a tapeworm about 1-4 millimeters long found in foxes, coyotes, and dogs (definitive hosts). Small rodents are intermediate hosts for _E. multilocularis_. Although cases of AE in animals in endemic areas are relatively common, human cases are rare. AE poses a much greater health threat to people than CE, causing parasitic tumors that can form in the liver, lungs, brain, and other organs. If left untreated, AE can be fatal.

Feeding a sick animal/canine to other canines is unwise, regardless of the disease. The question becomes, would you eat the animal if you didn't know what disease it had? Rabies is almost always fatal.

With 2 wolves being affected in a short time, one has to wonder whether the animals were related, or whether the disease is spreading between packs or territories in some other fashion.
