A 12-year-old boy has died in an anthrax outbreak in remote far northern Russia while dozens have been hospitalised on suspicion of infection, the region's [Yamal-Nenets] governor said [Mon 1 Aug 2016].

The [Yamal-Nenets] region, some 2000 kilometres (1250 miles) northeast of Moscow, has been under quarantine for a week after the deadly bacterium infected at least 9 nomadic reindeer herders and their animals. "I've been told of the death of a boy in our hospital. I have no words to express my feelings," governor Dmitry Kobylkin said.

It was the 1st outbreak of anthrax since 1941 in the sparsely populated region, which authorities blamed on a heat wave that melted permafrost and exposed an infected reindeer corpse. "The infection showed its cunning. Returning after 75 years, it took away a child's life," said Kobylkin. A total of 72 people, 41 of them children, have been hospitalised on suspicion of infection in the main city of Salekhard.

So far 9 have tested positive for anthrax, including the boy who died, the regional authorities said [Mon 1 Aug 2016].

More than 2300 reindeer have been killed in the outbreak in the region where more than 250 000 of the animals roam, the authorities said. The authorities said they were carrying out vaccinations of people and reindeer and giving those who visited the quarantine area antibacterial medicines. The infection was identified on [25 Jul 2016] after numerous deaths among reindeer, the sanitary medicine service for the region said [Mon 1 Aug 2016].

Russia's chief sanitary doctor Anna Popova visited the region last week, saying the site of the infection had been "isolated" and the region had enough vaccines and antibiotics. Popova said that there had been no cases of anthrax in the region among people or animals since 1941 and it had been considered formally free of the infection since 1968.

The regional authorities linked the outbreak to unusually hot weather, with more than a month of temperatures up to 35 deg C (95 deg Fahrenheit) that melted the permafrost and activated the deadly spores. "The anthrax spores lay in wait in the permafrost for more than a century," said the agriculture watchdog agency. Anthrax does not spread directly from one infected human or animal to another, but is spread through spores. Humans can contract anthrax from handling diseased animals or eating infected meat. The potentially lethal bacterium exists naturally in the soil [if contaminated by a previously infected dead animal] and commonly infects livestock which ingest its spores while grazing.

A 12-year-old boy evacuated from an anthrax epidemic zone in Russia has died in hospital while 8 other people have been diagnosed with the disease. The infection has resurfaced in western Siberia 75 years after the previous outbreak.

The child died in hospital in the city of Salekhard, the capital of the [Yamal-Nenets] Autonomous Area, where quarantine over the anthrax outbreak was declared last week. The boy was among several dozen indigenous people evacuated from the contaminated area. "We are 90 percent sure that he died from anthrax. He had the intestinal form of the disease, which is harder to diagnose," the office of Yamal Governor Dmitry Kobylkin told TASS [news agency].

The governor said he had no words to express his grief over the boy's death. "From day one we've been walking the extra mile and doing everything possible to save every life. But the infection has proven to be insidious," he said. "It returned after 75 years and claimed a child's life."

Another 8 people treated in Salekhard were confirmed to have anthrax, the authorities said earlier on [Mon 1 Aug 2016]. 3 of them are children, the statement said.

A total of 72 people, including 41 children, were taken to hospital after being evacuated from the remote area where the infection spread. Most of them tested negative for the disease. Yamal residents are collecting donations for the evacuees, who had to leave most of their possessions behind. Considering their nomadic lifestyle, many of them are now left with nothing except the clothes they are wearing.

....

Biological warfare troops and civilian emergencies specialists were deployed to the epidemic area to dispose of dead animals and eradicate pests such as rats, which can spread anthrax. [Rats! Not in my book. - Mod.MHJ] A mass vaccination of the population was conducted over the last week. Livestock vaccination is currently underway with a total of 41 000 animals expected to be given anthrax vaccine doses. The large area of the potential infection zone is hampering efforts, with veterinarians having to cover big distances to reach every reindeer herd.

[They say that they have confirmed anthrax in 8 hospitalised cases. That this boy died with enteric symptoms of anthrax is logical if they were eating the meat from a contaminated carcass. If the medics are inexperienced with treating clinical anthrax -- it has been a while since the previous outbreak -- they would have depended just on antibiotic treatment.

As was learnt from the multiple heroin related cases in the UK, one must actively drain off the toxin containing fluid, in this case in the abdomen. Antibiotics rapidly kill this pathogen but do nothing to neutralise the toxins they have produced. They must be drained from the thoracic cavity in pneumonic anthrax, abdominal cavity with enteric anthrax, and from the dead wound with injection anthrax. - Mod.MHJ
