Of the 4 monkeys found dead in the Ceilandia Rural Nucleus last week [beginning 7 Sep 2015], 3 were diagnosed with yellow fever [virus infections]. This information is from the Secretariat of Health of the Federal District (SES-DF). The confirmation came after the collection and testing of samples from the carcasses of the animals.

This past Thursday (10 [Sep 2015]), a report was forwarded for [results of testing of] a sample from a 5th dead monkey [when? confirmed or diagnosed as YF? - Mod.RNA]. The animal had been found in the Zoo of the DF [Federal District], and was also diagnosed with the disease.

According to the SES-DF, the Directorate of Environmental Surveillance (DIVAL) and the Brasilia Zoo are taking steps to prevent the disease. Among the measures are the search for [additional] dead monkeys, captures of vector mosquitoes that transmit the disease [vector control measures? Which are? - Mod.RNA], and the search for YF-unvaccinated people who work in the Zoo or reside in areas near where the monkeys were found. Also, according to the officials, blood from all the primates in the Zoo will be tested for control and prevention of the disease.

From January - September 2015, 3 confirmed human YF cases were recorded by the Health Network of the DF, with transmission in Goias state (municipalities of Alto Paraso, Sao Miguel do Araguaia and Alexania).

The Federal District has not had YF cases since 2010. In May [2015] the 2nd YF death in the capital was recorded. At that time, the National Agency for Health Surveillance (ANVISA) came to the conclusion that the man did not contract the disease in the Capital.

[The surveillance of zoonoses is among the main pillars of YF surveillance. When they occur, epizootics must be considered a potential sentinel event (suggestive of virus circulation), which eventually precede the occurrence of human cases of the disease in a given locality, including in disturbed environments. For this reason, actions are complex and involve investigation of primate deaths, identification of virus circulation (through serosurveys, for example), active search for human cases (syndromic surveys could be a strategy), control of vector [mosquito] infestations, and vaccination.

Some questions arise concerning the epizootic in the Federal District:
- Observation of the location of the Federal District or Brasilia Zoo (see (https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/Funda%C3%A7%C3%A3o+Jardim+Zool%C3%B3gico+de+Bras%C3%ADlia/@-15.8469422,-47.9393856,2950m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x99fba815a7ac0ef0) verifies that it is little (or not at all) sylvatic [forested].

- Given that, in fact, YF was confirmed in the dead monkey in the Zoo, and having mentioned "blood tests for all the primates in the Zoo,' as a measure to be taken, then is there an evaluation of the vaccination status of the Zoo workers and those who reside nearby? In consideration of the public that visits the Zoo, possibly a locality much frequented, what are the recommendations and information [to be issued]? Will the Zoo remain open for visitation? Will there be a recommendation that visitation be just for those with proof of vaccination? As for those who have just visited the Zoo and who could be in the incubation period, is there an alert or monitoring of them? - Mod.RNA ([n Portuguese, trans. Mod.TY]

Intensified monitoring of the entire areas where the dead monkeys were found is critical in order to determine the localities where the outbreak occurred and if it is expanding. It is also important to know the vaccination status of the human population in the general area, as Mod.RNA points out. If there are considerable populations of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito vectors in the area, there is risk of spill-over of YF virus from sylvan transmission involving monkeys, to the urban, human-to-human transmission cycle -- unless most of the people have been vaccinated.

[3 critical pieces of information are missing from this report:

- species of monkey(s) found dead -- most likely _Alouatta_, howler monkeys.

- distance from remnant forest in Ceilandia to the Federal Zoo; see map with Ceilandia at far left (25km in a direct line -- Google Earth ruler):

- whether the Zoo monkey was newly acquired within the likely incubation period (4-5 days) from outside the Federal District.
