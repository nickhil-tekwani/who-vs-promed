[This is the 4th year in a row that Rift Valley Fever has occurred in South Africa. Based on the past couple of years, we can expect somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 outbreaks across several provinces and the disease will last until May or June. Since South Africa has a no vaccination policy, the disease will likely have to run its course. Vaccination would indeed be difficult but for a discuss of the calculus surrounding control of RVF in South Africa see ProMED-mail Rift Valley fever, animal - South Africa (02): control strategy 20100606.1886.
