[From a previous ProMED posting...Vieira said the number of cases of BSE
could reach approximately 130 this ...calendar year. In the first 10 months
of 1999, 114 BSE cases were expected.
...Vieira told Reuters in an interview last month Portugal had so far
reported a total of 298 cases of mad cow disease, one of the highest
incidences in the EU after Britain.
...Portugal is not a major beef exporter. Before the ban, Portugal exported
between 1000 and 3000 tons per year on average, much of it to Spain.
...The country imports 40 000 to 50 000 tons of beef per year.
Does anyone know how this translates in terms of the likelihood that any
given animal will contract BSE? The figures above indicate a high incidence
rate in a small population, and unless the Portuguese consume less beef per
capita than elsewhere then the risks posed to those eating locally produced
meat would be of the same order of magnitude as, say, in Britain.
