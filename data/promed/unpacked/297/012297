FDA ADVISORY MEETING
Regarding the numerous press releases on the FDA advisory meeting regarding
tallow, tallow derivatives and gelatin. It should be made clear that the
committee was asked specific questions by FDA regarding the possible
relaxation of voluntary guidelines as related to use of these products from
BSE risk or unknown risk countries as determined by USDA. Currently all of
Europe is in this category.
While representatives from US industry presented info on tallow and its
derivatives, the FDA was only concerned with imported materials used in FDA
regulated products; pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, medical devices, etc.
Currently FDA guidelines are that NO imported tallow, tallow derivatives and
gelatin sourced from materials from BSE-risk countries are to be used in FDA
regulated products. The committee recommended to FDA the following points:
1) NO change to the existing FDA guidelines regarding tallow; 6-5 vote.
2) Recommended to allow use of tallow derivatives in FDA regulated products
from BSE-risk countries; 6:5 vote.
I sat in on most of the gelatin session, but not the final vote. Still not
clear to me from press releases if gelatin from European materials was
given an OK or not. [Incidentally, the advisory group was only addressing
gelatin for oral and topical administration. My gut feeling from sitting in
on most of the meeting and from wading through the many misleading press
releases afterwards is that the committee recommended no change (still
banned) and said they would reassess once the European Gelatin Manufactures
completed their ongoing research on inactivation. But really don't know for
sure.
