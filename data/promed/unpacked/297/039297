Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 109
---------------------------------
Weekly update
-------------
As of 12 Jul 2010, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas
territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases
of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including more than 18 337 deaths.
The WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through
frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member
States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.

Situation update
----------------
Worldwide, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low. The most
active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are
in parts of South Asia, West Africa, and Central America. In the
temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, pandemic and seasonal
influenza activity has remained low during the 1st half of the
southern hemisphere winter, except in South Africa, where increased
detections of primarily seasonal influenza viruses (type B and H3N2)
were reported during late June and early July 2010. Seasonal
influenza H3N2 viruses continue to circulate at varying levels across
parts of the Americas, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Increased seasonal
influenza activity continues to be observed in several countries of
Central America.

To date, most countries of the temperate zone of the southern
hemisphere, with the exception of South Africa, have reported low
overall levels of respiratory disease activity and low to sporadic
levels of pandemic and seasonal influenza virus circulation during
the 1st half of the southern hemisphere winter season. Pandemic
influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically or at low
levels in most of these countries.

As reported last week, South Africa began observing a sharp increase
in the proportion of sentinel respiratory samples testing positive
for influenza virus (primarily seasonal influenza B and H3N2) during
late June 2010, reaching a peak of ~50 percent detection rate during
the 1st week of July 2010, and falling to ~40 percent during the 2nd
week of July 2010. In Chile (as of late June 2010) and Argentina (as
of early July 2010), the most recent available data show that
influenza activity remains sporadic in Argentina and low in Chile (~5
percent respiratory samples tested positive for influenza, 84 percent
of which were pandemic virus with small numbers of seasonal influenza
H3N2 and type B detected as well). In both Chile and Argentina, RSV
[respirattory syncytial virus] has been the predominant circulating
respiratory virus since mid-April 2010.

In Australia, as of the last week of June 2010, overall rates of ILI
[Influenza-like illness] remained low and below levels observed
during the same period in past 3 winter seasons. Although a small
cluster of pandemic influenza cases, including a few hospitalized
cases, were recently detected in the Northern Territory of Australia,
pandemic and seasonal influenza virus detections remain otherwise
sporadic, albeit slightly increased during late June and early July
2010. Similarly, in New Zealand, rates of ILI have remained low and
below the seasonal baseline, with only sporadic detections of
pandemic and seasonal H3N2 viruses through the 1st week of July 2010.
In both Australia and New Zealand, current levels of ILI are similar
to those observed during the same period in 2008, when the influenza
season was noted to have arrived and peaked late in winter.

In Asia, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low to sporadic,
except in parts of southern and western India, Malaysia, and
Singapore. As reported last week, in India, transmission of pandemic
influenza virus remains active but stable in the southern state of
Kerala. The extent of illness in the community is currently being
assessed and monitored by the Government of India. Similar numbers of
new cases, including small numbers of fatal cases, have been reported
on a weekly basis since transmission 1st increased during mid-June
2010. Recent, small increases in pandemic influenza virus circulation
have also been observed since mid-June 2010 in other southern and
western states of India, particularly in the western state of Maharashtra.

In Singapore, levels of ARI [acute respiratory infection] increased
during the 1st 2 weeks of July 2010; however, the intensity of
pandemic influenza virus transmission has declined during June and
July 2010 after peaking in May 2010. The proportion of patients with
ILI testing positive for pandemic influenza virus in Singapore
remained stable (14-16 percent) during 1st 2 weeks of July 2010. In
addition, substantial co-circulation of seasonal influenza H3N2
viruses (with pandemic H1N1 virus) was detected in Singapore
throughout May and June 2010. In Malaysia, numbers of new cases of
pandemic influenza continued to decline; overall pandemic influenza
activity fell substantially in June and early July 2010 after peaking
during mid-April to mid-May 2010.

Low levels of seasonal influenza type B viruses (and to much lesser
extent pandemic influenza virus) continue to circulate across
northern and southern China as levels of ILI remain stable and near
seasonal levels seen in the same period in recent years. Low levels
of pandemic and seasonal influenza (H3N2 and type B) viruses also
continued to circulate in Hong Kong SAR (China), Chinese Taipei, and
parts of Thailand.

In the tropical regions of the Americas, overall pandemic and
seasonal influenza activity remained low, except in parts of Central
and South America, where there has been recent active co-circulation
of pandemic and seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses. The majority of
recent active transmission of pandemic influenza virus has been
reported in Colombia, Costa Rica, and to a lesser extent in Cuba.

In Colombia, although low level circulation of pandemic influenza
viruses has persisted throughout the 1st half of 2010, a 2nd period
of active transmission began in mid-May 2010, peaked in June 2010,
has now largely subsided during the 2nd of week of July 2010.
Similarly, in Costa Rica, low level circulation of pandemic virus has
persisted throughout 2010, however, there has been a recent
resurgence in active transmission (though less intense than the
initial 2009 wave) of pandemic influenza virus during June 2010.

As reported previously, in Panama, a sharp increase in the
circulation influenza A viruses (particularly H3N2, but also small
numbers of pandemic H1N1) was reported over the month of June 2010; a
high intensity of respiratory diseases and a moderate impact on
health care services continued to be reported during the 2nd week of
July 2010. In Nicaragua, recent active transmission of seasonal
influenza H3N2 viruses, which began during late May 2010 and peaked
during mid June 2010, appears to have largely subsided during recent
weeks. Many countries in the region continue to report ongoing
co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, most notably RSV.

In sub-Saharan Africa, the current situation is largely unchanged
since the last update. Pandemic and seasonal influenza activity
continues to be observed in several countries. Ghana, in West Africa,
continued to have a sustained resurgence in circulation of pandemic
influenza virus during June 2010, more than several months after the
1st period of pandemic activity peaked (early April 2010). Seasonal
influenza type B viruses continue to circulate in parts of central
and southern Africa, particularly in Cameroon, where an increase in
influenza type B virus circulation was observed during June 2010.
Small numbers of seasonal H3N2 viruses continue to be detected across
Africa, particularly in eastern and southern Africa; the most recent
detections have been reported in Kenya and South Africa.

Overall, in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere (North
America and Europe), pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses have
been detected only sporadically or at very low levels during the past month.

Ministry of health websites in the last 2 weeks. The percent of
specimens tested positive for influenza includes all specimens tested
positive for seasonal or pandemic influenza. The pie charts show the
distribution of virus subtypes among all specimens that were tested

[Worldwide, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low with
Increased seasonal influenza activity being observed in several
countries in Central America. Respiratory syncytial virus continues
to feature as the predominant respiratory virus circulating in
several South American countries. The statistics do not reveal the
age of patients so it is unclear whether these infections are
confined to infants or occurring throughout the general community. - Mod.CP]
