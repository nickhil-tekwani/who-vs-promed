US soldiers get food poisoning in Afghanistan
---------------------------------------------
Turkey stuffing from a Thanksgiving meal may have caused more than 100
soldiers to fall ill with food poisoning at a United States base in
Afghanistan, the US military said Sat 30 Nov 2002. Seventy-nine US
soldiers, 25 Romanians, and some soldiers from other countries suffered
nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting beginning Thursday night, 28 Nov 2002, at
the base near the south eastern city of Kandahar, said Master Sgt Kelly
Tyler, a spokeswoman at Bagram Air Base, the headquarters of the US-led
military operation in Afghanistan.
The source of the illness was under investigation, though a medical
official at Bagram said turkey stuffing from the Thanksgiving Day holiday
meal was suspected. No soldiers were admitted to hospital, and most were
ill for no more than 24 hours. "There is no reason to suspect any malicious
intent," Tyler said.
Sanitation officials were inspecting the kitchen facilities where the meal
was prepared. At Kandahar, where about 4000 US and coalition troops are
based, American and Romanian military cooks prepare the meals. About 400
Romanian troops are based at Kandahar. At Bagram, the largest US base in
Afghanistan, private contractors cook the food.

[The apparent short incubation period and self limiting nature of the
illness suggests that this outbreak may have been caused by a preformed
toxin such as occurs in clostridial or staphylococcal food poisoning.
Clostridial food poisoning tends to occur 8--16 hours after ingestion and
manifests with diarrhea and abdominal pain. Staphylococcal food poisoning
has a shorter incubation period (1--6 hours) and may cause both vomiting
and diarrhea. Less commonly, _Bacillus cereus_ can produce illnesses
similar to both. Viral gastroenteritis, such as caused by Norwalk-like
virus, may also produce a similar illness. These illnesses tend to last
24--48 hours and can be spread secondarily from person to person. - Mod.LL]
