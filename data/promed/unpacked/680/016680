[FMDV O/EA-3 is known to be endemic in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, and Sudan. This virus has been circulating in Egypt at least since 2012. According to media reports, the disease was introduced into the Gaza Strip in January 2017, from Egypt, by illegally imported livestock through tunnels between Sinai and the Gaza Strip (see 20170316.4903671). The cases in fattening cattle were later officially reported to the OIE. One outbreak was reported in February 2017 in a single dairy cattle operation in adjacent southwest Israel.

The initial genotyping of the virus strains in the Gaza Strip and southwest Israel, as FMDV "O EA-3" was carried out by the Kimron Veterinary Institute at Beit-Dagan, Israel; this has later been confirmed by the WRLFMD (Pirbright), where the strains from the West Bank (Yatta) were found to be of the same East African/Egyptian genotype. The results obtained at Pirbright, addressing samples collected in Egypt during 2016 and 2017 in several governorates, are available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/sites/world/files/WRLMEG-2018-00004-EGY-GTR-O-O_001.pdf.

In May 2017, and again in November 2017, several outbreaks, caused by the same virus, were reported in the West Bank (Palestinian Autonomous Territories) in cattle, sheep and goats; one cattle herd was infected in Ayn-al-Sahla, Israel, adjacent to the northern demarcation line with the Palestinian territory (20170608.5090630). This was, as far as we currently know, the last outbreak caused by this strain in Israel.

The disease reportedly recurred in the central and northern parts of the West Bank in June and July 2018, but the causative agent remained untyped until late January 2019, when samples were submitted to WRLFMD, leading to its being serotyped O and genotyped EA-3, as reported above. During the same period, and later in 2018, FMD caused 2 extensive FMD events in northern parts of Israel, caused by strains of FMDV serotype O, topotype ME-SA, lineage PanAsia-2. This still continuing event has involved also wildlife, mainly wild boar and gazelles.

Thus, it may be concluded that, at least until recently, 2 different topotypes of FMDV-O have been circulating simultaneously in the territory encompassing Israel and the Palestinian authority. One, "O EA-3," originating from Egypt, is mainly circulating in the West Bank; its southern route of introduction is regarded exceptional. The other one, ME-SA/PanAsia-2, is found in northern and northeastern parts of Israel, most likely introduced from Syria/Lebanon and, less likely, northwest Jordan. A route familiar for decades. - Mod.AS
