The [Nunavut] territory is seeing its worst tuberculosis [TB]
outbreak in more than a decade, with 87 cases diagnosed so far this
year [2010]. From 1 Jan to 30 Sep 2010, 87 TB cases were diagnosed in
Nunavut, with 92 per cent of them [80 cases] in the Baffin region,
said Elaine Randell, communicable disease consultant with Nunavut's
Department of Health and Social Services. She added 40 of those cases
were in Iqaluit, 27 in Cape Dorset, and the rest in other
communities. Randell also said 15 to 24-year-olds were hit the hardest.

The outbreak peaked in May [2010]. Only 3 TB cases were diagnosed in
the territory in September. "There seems to be a downward trend,
although with TB, it's probably too early to tell but we're hoping
that this is the beginning of a downward trend," she said. "It would
appear that Iqaluit and Cape Dorset both have their own strains. The
outbreaks don't seem to be related."

This year's [2010] surge in cases already surpasses the previous
record set in 2008, when 58 people were diagnosed with TB, an
infectious and potentially deadly disease that often attacks the
lungs. "Nunavut has all the elements for a perfect storm when it
comes to TB," she said. "You have a high rate of infection among the
Inuit, which makes all the communities sort of at risk for outbreaks.
You also have the social determinants for health -- the poverty,
[lack of] access to healthy foods, crowded housing conditions, those
sorts of things." Those factors make the territory "ripe for this
type of outbreak," she said.

She added they have traced anyone who might have been in contact with
an infected person, sought other cases, and added staff to the
busiest areas. Randell said they are also revising the TB manual for
health care workers and developing a communications strategy. She
said they have even offered taxi vouchers as incentives for people to
come for treatment. "For the most part, most of the clients have been
very co-operative in helping us," she said. In Cape Dorset, mayor
Cary Merritt, as the general manager of the local co-op, has provided
food vouchers to the co-op's restaurant as an incentive for people to
follow their treatment. "It's helping making sure people come in to
get their treatments on time," he said.

"We're not so worried because we have a really good nurse in place
right now. She's been very proactive with making sure people come in
and get their treatment. I believe she is really doing a good job
bringing down the cases now and with the level of treatment, she's
ensuring it's happening. I think we will see a drastic reduction now."

[Nunavut, the largest federal territory of Canada, is the size of
Western Europe; it comprises a major portion of Northern Canada, and
has an estimated population in 2010 of about 33 000, mostly Inuit
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunavut>). The territorial capital
Iqaluit, which had a population in 2006 of 6184, is on Baffin Island,
which had a population of 11 000 in 2007. Cape Dorset is a town
located on Dorset Island at the southern tip of Baffin Island with a
population in 2006 of 1236.

The TB incidence rate for the first 9 months of 2010 is thus 727 per
100 000 in the Baffin region with 80 cases, 647 per 100 000 in
Iqaluit with 40 cases, and 2184 per 100 000 in Cape Dorset with 27
cases, whereas the annual incidence rate for Canada as a whole has
been reported to be less than 5 per 100 000
(<http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/tbpc-latb/itir-eng.php>).

Aboriginal peoples in Canada comprise the Inuit, First Nations, and
Metis (indigenous First People of Canada who trace their descent to
mixed European and First Nations parentage)
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_peoples_in_Canada>). The
2006 census counted a total Canadian Aboriginal population of 1 172
790 (3.75 percent of the population), which includes 698 025 First
Nations (2.23 percent), 389 785 Metis (1.25 percent), and 50 480
Inuit (0.16 percent) (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Canada>).

Since the 1st contact with Europeans, the Canadian Aboriginals have
had a disproportionately high burden of TB disease. For example, high
incidence rates for TB have been reported among Aboriginals, mainly
First Nations, in Northern Manitoba: specifically 48.4 per 100 000
overall, with rates as high as 496.3 per 100 000 in select
communities (<http://www.skylarkmedicalclinic.com/TubercuosisinManitoba.htm>).

In 2002, the Public Health Agency of Canada
(<http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/tbcbap-tbpac/special_report-eng.php>)
reported that from 1991-1999, of 17 590 new active and relapsed TB
cases, 3013 (17 percent) occurred among Canadian-born Aboriginals
(which constitute only 3.75 percent of the population). Of the
remaining cases, 4201 (24 percent) occurred in Canadian-born
non-Aboriginals and 10 281 (58 percent) occurred in foreign-born
individuals. Aboriginals with TB were younger (median 27 years) than
foreign-born (median 39 years) and non-Aboriginals (median 59 years).
In this report, drug resistant strains of TB had not yet emerged as a
significant problem in this population. Less than 2 percent of
reported cases were resistant to one or more drugs. The extent of HIV
co-infection could not be estimated using data from this surveillance
system. (HIV status was known for only 2 percent of reported
Aboriginal cases.) In the 1990's, Aboriginal people were said to have
an overall TB rate almost 4 times higher than the Canada-wide rate.

More recently, the situation has apparently worsened. In a news
release in March 2010, the Inuit were reported to be "the most at
risk of tuberculosis infection with a rate that is 186 times higher
than the non-aboriginal average. This is double what it was just 4
years ago"
(<http://www.suite101.com/content/tb-epidemic-among-canadas-native-people-a211908#ixzz11jIy6OW1>).
The high rates for TB in the Canadian Aboriginal population have been
attributed to limited access to healthcare in remote regions,
substandard housing, with whole families living in a single room,
widespread poverty, and malnutrition
(<http://www.suite101.com/content/tb-epidemic-among-canadas-native-people-a211908#ixzz11jIy6OW1>).

The TB control plan described in the news release above seems
inadequate for the situation. For example, the treatment plan in
Nunavut relies on the patients self-administering medication. Because
of the frequency of non-adherence to TB treatment regimens in all
populations, directly observed therapy (DOTS) is the internationally
recommended strategy for TB case management. DOTS requires an
independent observer watching patients swallow each dose of their
anti-TB therapy. The independent observer is not necessarily a
healthcare worker; the person could be, for example, a tribal elder
or similar senior person within that community. Because drug
resistance and HIV co-infection may require modification of the TB
treatment regimens (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5211.pdf>), HIV
status and drug resistance should be determined in each case, if not
done already, in the current outbreak in Nunavut.

A program to prevent latent from becoming active disease should
accompany early detection of cases of active tuberculosis and its
prompt and complete treatment. Most cases of progression from latent
TB to active tuberculosis occur within 2 to 12 months of initial
infection. Children and adolescents are especially at high risk for
progression to tuberculosis disease (with potential for disseminated
disease). Most children with latent TB have been recently infected
(especially those younger than age 5 years), usually from exposure to
a person with active TB in their immediate environment, usually the
household. Children exposed to active TB must be evaluated and
treated for latent TB. TB control requires government commitment of
funds and personnel more than a single nurse in the field for such a
large and remote region, even though she may be "a really good nurse".
