Anyone with 4-legged loved ones may want to be sure their flea and tick medications are up to date, because area veterinarians say cases are increasing.

Dr Scott Moore, a veterinarian at Fairmont Veterinary Hospital, said his clinic sees 1 to 2 cases per week, not only through the summer but year round.

"Over the last 3 years, it has gone up dramatically in this area," Moore said. "In the state of West Virginia last year [2016], it was about 1 in 16 dogs tested positive for Lyme disease. That's a pretty high number. As far as for us, I think last year [2016] we had 90 to 95 cases in our office."

Veterinarians predict the rise can be attributed, at least partially, to a milder winter, as it must be below 40 deg F [4.5 deg C] for Lyme disease to become inactive.

"It was a pretty mild winter, so we had ticks in January and February, and they increase now in the spring, but they're always out there," said Dr Gary McCutcheon, a veterinarian at All Pets Animal Clinic.

"They don't go away like a lot of bugs do," McCutcheon said.

He said Lyme disease isn't the only disease that ticks can transmit. "Lyme disease gets all the press, but there are also things like Rocky Mountain spotted fever and those types of things," he said. "There are certain regions of the country where they're more prevalent than others. Lyme disease is spreading because as people move, they might take ticks with them. It used to be just in the Southeast, but now it's pretty much across most of the country."

Moore said there has been a trend over the past 10 years that ticks carrying Lyme disease have been becoming more prevalent in northern states.

"So we actually expected this to happen," he said. "Up in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, area, the rate of Lyme disease is a lot higher, as far as dogs tested. We're still on the edge of it."

Moore said his facility has also had cats test positive recently, although it's still unknown if the disease is a significant issue for cats.

"In dogs, it causes severe lameness, and it can be to the point that those animals can't move," he said. "Their joints get infected and inflamed, and those animals have a lot of pain."

In a worst-case scenario, Moore said Lyme disease can lead to a non-treatable form of kidney failure in canines.

"I have spoken with one veterinarian in the last 5 years who has been able to successfully get a kidney failure patient out of that situation," he said. "They caught that patient at an extraordinarily early stage. Once they become symptomatic for kidney disease from Lyme disease, for most of those patients, it's fatal."

Most canine patients, however, do not progress to that point.

"The really exciting thing is the majority of cases that we diagnose are diagnosed on a screening test, so they're asymptomatic," Moore said. "The asymptomatic patients have actually been very effectively treated with antibiotics. It's a month's course of antibiotics, and when we follow up their testing, we can show that they demonstrate significant improvement."

Diseases associated with tick bites can sometimes be hard to diagnose, McCutcheon said.

"Just like a human, they (dogs) can get bitten by a tick and not even know it," he said. "They have signs, but it's not a real common thing you think of. I think they're becoming more prevalent, and they're testing for it more. When you test more, you're going to find more."

Of course, Lyme disease is completely preventable, thanks to many preventive methods available at veterinary clinics.

"There are basically 2 really good ways to prevent it, and I think everybody should do both," Moore said. "One is with a very good flea and tick product. If you're not sure if what you're using covers ticks, you should check with your veterinarian."

Medications provide one-month and 3-month coverage for pets.

"In dogs and cats both, Frontline has been around a long time, and many people use it," McCutcheon said. "We also like the Seresto collar, which is an 8-month collar, with one for dogs and one for cats. It sort of acts as a repellent, too, and does a great job. They stay effective even if they get wet."

Moore said vaccines are also available.

"There's still not a vaccine for humans, but there is a very good vaccine for dogs," he said. "I would recommend an annual vaccination for Lyme disease and monthly or full-coverage."

Lyme disease, even in humans, is a relatively new disease -- it was first discovered about 30 years ago -- and until recently it was thought that once a patient developed the disease, it would carry it forever.

"Now, they think if you catch it early, there is a possibility of complete treatment success," Moore said. "That's an improvement over where we thought we were."

Treatments have improved greatly in that time as well, McCutcheon said. "It used to be we had to use sprays and powders and react to a problem," he said. "Now, we have wonderful products to prevent. It's a change of mindset where we can prevent things, and, if you can prevent things, that's great."

[Lyme borreliosis is a bacterial, tick-transmitted disease of animals (dogs, horses, probably cats) and people. In people one of the common lesions is a target shaped red lesion, sometimes called a 'bull's eye' lesion in reference to hitting the center of a target.

"The history of Lyme disease in Connecticut began in 1975 when a cluster of children and adults residing in the Lyme, Connecticut area experienced uncommon arthritic symptoms (1976 circular letter; http://tinyurl.com/mt4j3ku). By 1977, the 1st 51 cases of Lyme arthritis were described, and the _Ixodes scapularis_ (black-legged) tick was linked to the transmission of the disease. During 1982, _Borrelia burgdorferi_, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, was discovered and the 1st brochure addressing Lyme disease was developed by the Arthritis Foundation. Serology testing became widely available in Connecticut during 1984. In 1987, Lyme disease became a reportable disease. All physicians were required to report any and all cases of the disease. By 1988, the news of Lyme disease spread and national media attention began. The first federal funding for Lyme disease surveillance, education, and research became available in 1991. The first Lyme disease vaccine became available in 1997. To help determine the efficacy of the vaccine, Lyme disease was made laboratory reportable in 1998. However, the manufacturer withdrew the vaccine from the market in 2001. In 2002, the vaccine efficacy study ended, and Lyme disease was removed from the list of laboratory reportable findings; however, it remained a physician reportable disease." (http://www.ct.gov/dph/cwp/view.asp?a=3138&q=388506)

In the US, the incidence of Lyme disease is highly concentrated in northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central states, where the incidence rates varied from 14.4 to 70.5/100 000 in 2014, in contrast to the southeastern states, where the incidence rates were less than 1/100 000 in 2014 (http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/tables.html). A map of the US showing the distribution of Lyme disease cases can be found at (https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/maps.html). This article states our mobile society has been responsible for moving the vectors around and all areas are now quite likely to see this disease at any given time.

There are "19 different genospecies that fall within the _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex. Within this complex, the most important spirochete species are _B burgdorferi_ sensu stricto (North America, Europe), _B. afzelii_ (Europe, Asia), _B. bavariensis_, and _B. garinii_ (Europe, Asia), all of which are pathogenic for people. Only _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto has been shown so far to be pathogenic for domestic animals under experimental conditions. Tick vectors of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato are hard-shelled _Ixodes_ ticks. In the USA, these are primarily _I. scapularis_ in the northeast and Midwest and _I. pacificus_ on the Pacific coast. _I. ricinus_ and _I. persulcatus_ are the primary vectors in Europe and Asia. _B. miyamotoi_ is another member of the genus _Borrelia_. Although this spirochete is transmitted by ixodid ticks and may cause infections in mammals characterized by clinical signs such as fever, headache, fatigue, and muscle aches, the bacterium is a relapsing, fever-causing organism." (https://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/lyme-borreliosis/overview-of-lyme-borreliosis)

While this article mentions joint infection/inflammation, lameness, and renal problems, animals may also present with cardiac abnormalities. Most often dogs are seen with lethargy and fever, intermittent to recurrent lameness; anorexia; and sometimes lymphadenopathy with or without swollen, painful joints as the most common clinical signs. Clinical signs are generally non specific and can be a diagnostic challenge as owners may not know their animals have had tick bites, and may not know if they themselves have had tick bites. A variety of blood or serum tests are available to help diagnose this disease.

Early diagnosis is the key to successful treatment and prevention of fatal consequences, such as kidney failure or cardiac failure. Antibiotics are generally successful when the disease is caught early.

There are vaccines available for dogs, but not for human beings. There are also a number of tick and flea repellents, either as oral or topical applications for both the dog and the cat. Keeping ticks off of your pet can help protect you. However, ticks can often ride into the home undetected on shoes or pants. Regardless of where you live or travel, tick prevention for your pets a good idea. - Mod.TG
