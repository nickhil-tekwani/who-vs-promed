Quarantine was declared in Bellavista prison because of a varicella outbreak. The authorities are currently assessing the inmates and measures are taken, aiming to avoid additional cases.

In the last few hours, 460 inmates from ward 16 in Bellavista prison were placed into quarantine after a varicella outbreak had been detected, which led to placing 7 inmates under isolation conditions.

Mr. Jorge Carmona, a human rights attorney, declared that this measure had upset the inmates' relatives, since nearly 350 persons were not able to enter the facility for the Sunday visits that were originally scheduled for children and women.

The discomfort arose because the quarantine was established last [Sat 21 Jul 2018] evening, and the outbreak has been taking place for the past few days. The inmates' relatives come from many different places outside Medellin, and even from different communities. This implies they had to waste money for planning a visit to the Bellavista prison, and this could have been prevented had they been warned on time of the visit cancellation", explained Mr. Carmona.

He also emphasized that the poor hygiene conditions could be the cause for the outbreak. The authorities are currently assessing the inmates and measures are taken, aiming to avoid additional cases.

[Chickenpox (Varicella) is a very contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It causes a blister-like rash, itching, tiredness, and fever. The rash appears 1st on the stomach, back and face and can spread over the entire body causing between 250 and 500 itchy blisters. Chickenpox can be serious, especially in babies, adults, and people with weakened immune systems. The best way to prevent chickenpox is to get the chickenpox vaccine.

The virus spreads mainly by touching or breathing in the virus particles that come from chickenpox blisters, and possibly through tiny droplets from infected people that get into the air after they breathe or talk, for example. (CDC)

Prisons with their closely housed inmates, provide the perfect environment to facilitate spread of the virus. Because an infected individual can spread the disease from 1 to 2 days before they get the rash until all their chickenpox blisters have formed scabs, surveillance and possibly quarantine must be conducted to prevent further spread. - Mod.LK
