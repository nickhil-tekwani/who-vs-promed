The foot and mouth disease [FMD] outbreak is unlikely to have spread
outside Surrey, the government has announced.
Meanwhile, the BBC has learned that initial tests at a farm outside the
existing 10km (6.2 mi) surveillance zone are negative. [This relates to the
farm near Dorking, mentioned in ProMED-mail 20070810.2598; good news, still
pending upon final results and official confirmation. - Mod.AS]
According to DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs), 2
farms near Guilford have tested positive for the disease, while animals
culled at a 3rd inside the zone did not have FMD. Prime minister Gordon
Brown has said the UK is "open for business" following the outbreak.
DEFRA said Hunts Hill Farm inside the surveillance zone, where 362 cows,
sheep, pigs, and goats were destroyed as a precautionary measure, did not
have the disease.
Chief veterinary officer Debby Reynolds briefed reporters on an interim
report into the outbreak. She said: "It sets out that the most likely
scenario is that the infection will be restricted to the Surrey area. But
it does set out alternatives." The report also found the most likely source
of the outbreak was the nearby Pirbright lab site, used by vaccine
manufacturer Merial and the state-run Institute for Animal Health. Ms
Reynolds added: "It concludes that the risk of spread of infection out of
Surrey through undisclosed infection in sheep during the risk period is
very low. And this report -- and it's an interim, initial report -- sets
out the most likely scenario that whilst there is a risk of further
outbreaks in the same area, it is unlikely that infection from the original
release of virus will occur. However, further cases could occur through
secondary spread." [For the interim epidemiological report, see items 2 and
3 below. - Mod.AS] She also said a programme of vaccination would not be
carried out but the situation would be reviewed daily.
Prime minister Mr Brown said everything was being done to get the UK back
to normal outside the restricted zones. Restrictions on taking animals to
abattoirs have been lifted but many movements of livestock -- such as
sending animals to market -- are still banned. He said farmers would be
compensated for clean-up costs on top of normal compensation, and payments
would start going out "in the next few days. "We have restricted the
disease to a limited area of this country. The risk of it spreading out of
these areas is low if not negligible," he said.
Mike Giffin, chairman of the Surrey branch of the National Farmers' Union,
said FMD was "under control" at the moment.

FMD update: publication of interim epidemiology report and vaccination
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In accordance with contingency planning arrangements vaccination is at the
forefront of disease control policy in FMD outbreaks. Arrangements for
possible vaccination were triggered immediately disease was confirmed on
Fri 3 Aug 2007. The Forward Vaccination Centre was in place by 6 Aug 2007
outside of the Surveillance Zone with teams in place ready to vaccinate
should the decision be taken to do so.
Any decision to vaccinate is based on a veterinary assessment of risk and
follows the FMD vaccination decision tree in the contingency plan.
Vaccination is used as a disease control measure if it is demonstrated that
steps additional to slaughter policy may be required to eradicate the disease.
In line with this decision tree and the emerging conclusions of
epidemiology investigations it has been decided not to vaccinate at this
time. However, this approach will be kept under constant review as the
disease situation develops and the Forward Vaccination Centre will be kept
in place.
As part of the evidence base for this decision Defra has today [10 Aug
2007] published an interim epidemiology report into the outbreak of FMD in
Surrey.
The report sets out initial findings of the National Emergency Epidemiology
Group who have been investigating the outbreak. It concludes that it is
very likely that the source of infection is the Pirbright site where Merial
Animal Health Ltd and the Institute for Animal Health are located.
The report goes on to identify the possible mechanisms for spread of the
virus from the Pirbright site.
It concludes that the risk of spread of infection out of Surrey through
movements of undisclosed infection in sheep during the risk period is very
low. It sets out the most likely scenario that while there is a risk of
further cases in the same area, it is unlikely that infection from the
original release of the virus will occur, however, further cases could
arise from secondary spread.
Chief veterinary officer, Debby Reynolds said: "The decision not to
vaccinate at this stage, but to retain our full readiness to do so,
demonstrates that our contingency planning arrangements are working. The
epidemiology report indicates that infection may be contained to the Surrey
area. But, these are our emerging findings, this is a developing situation
and new information may come to light at any stage which changes our
understanding of the outbreak. It is therefore crucial that all animal
keepers continue with the most stringent biosecurity measures, remain
vigilant and contact their own veterinarian or local Animal Health Office
if they have any concerns."

Summary epidemiology report. Situation as at 10:00 Thu 9 Aug 2007, day 6
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Executive summary
-----------------
1. Two confirmed cases and one highly probable case of foot and mouth
disease [FMD] have been confirmed in Surrey since 9pm on Fri 3 Aug 2007.
The shape of the Protection and Surveillance Zones on 8 Aug 2007 are shown
on the map [at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/footandmouth/pdf/declaration-pz-sz-rz-070809.pdf>].
2. The strain of virus has been identified as type O1 BFS, which is the
strain recovered from the 1967 FMD epidemic in Great Britain. This strain
is used by both of the enterprises on the nearby Pirbright site. Current
evidence suggests that this site is the most likely source of infection for
the 1st IP (infected premises).
3. The mechanism of spread from the Pirbright site is under investigation;
possibilities include
- windborne spread, as winds were in a suitable direction at times during
the risk period
- via effluent released from the laboratory, possibly aided by local flooding
- deliberate or accidental fomite transmission from one of the laboratory
containment areas
4. At this stage analysis of the clinical picture on the IPs does not give
particular weight to any one of these possible mechanisms.
5. The main concerns are
5.1. Other holdings in the area may have been infected at the same time or
during the same risk period, as the identified case and have not yet been
detected. Spread of disease may have occurred from these, either locally or
further.
5.2. Live virus production for vaccine production has stopped so there is
no further risk of release from this source, however livestock in the
Protection Zone may still be at risk from the original release. This could
lead to further cases in the area.
Forward look
------------
Most likely scenario:
There is a possibility that there will be further cases in the same area.
If the virus in the original release is now fully dispersed, and diluted
beyond infectivity, it is unlikely there will be further exposure from the
release itself beyond 6 Aug 2007, when vaccine manufacture was suspended.
Further cases may arise from secondary spread from identified IPs or the
SOS; if an incubation period of 12 days is assumed these would develop
clinical signs by 20 Aug 2007.
Alternative scenario:
The virus released from the Pirbright site has not fully dispersed and
there is still virus available in the environment that could infect
susceptible livestock. At present this is believed unlikely as intensive
surveillance has found few cases in the area at risk, and the weather and
dilution/dispersal as virus moves into the environment mitigate against its
survival.
Worst case scenario:
Infection may have reached other holdings in the vicinity of the Pirbright
site during the risk period, which has not been detected, and infected
animals have been moved to other holdings. There is no evidence to support
this hypothesis at present. However the risk of non-detection is highest in
sheep, and review of movements of sheep out of Surrey (described above)
suggests that there is a very low likelihood of this.

*In view of previous lack of clarity regarding the FMD situation at the
Elstead farm (around which a separate protection zone was established), we
hereby copy the Descriptive Epidemiology of FMD 2007/0001 (IP 1):
"This (IP 1) was a small, family run, beef finishing enterprise with 4
associated land-parcels, 3 of which had susceptible stock. The affected
animals were in a field approximately 4.5 km (2.8 mi) southwest of the
Pirbright site, IP 1A, Normandy. There were 38 cattle at grass and clinical
signs were present in all of these animals. FMD was confirmed by laboratory
tests. The oldest lesion was 9 days; 30 of the animals had 6-8 day lesions.
"The main farm premises, IP 1B, Elstead, which was reported with a single
inconclusive laboratory test result in one of the 4 cattle there, has been
retested and found to be negative. The 3rd premises (IP 1c) had one RT-PCR
positive in the 22 cattle, but there was no evidence of clinical disease".
An official follow-up report to the OIE is anticipated. - Mod.AS
There have been accounts in the UK that in spite of the nationwide stop
order animals were being moved, especially in the Midlands, and that
farmers were getting very anxious, and politically rowdy, because of the
delays and costs of getting livestock to slaughter. So the current
relaxation takes account of reality and that the disease affected area
seems to be very restricted to the immediate SSW of Pirbright IAH & Merial.
