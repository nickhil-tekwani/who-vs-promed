The city of Fort St John [British Columbia] is warning the community about black knot. The fungus attacks explicitly plum and cherry trees. It can be identified by hard, black, uneven swellings on branches which release a lot of spores just before leaves appear in spring. Experts can't agree on the effectiveness of fungicides on black knot disease, but most warn against relying solely on them.

[Black knot disease caused by the fungus _Apiosporina morbosa_ has been reported to affect more than 20 species of genus _Prunus_, including cultivated plum, cherry, apricot, peach, as well as their wild relatives. It has so far only been reported from North America where it is indigenous and widespread. The European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO) has included the pathogen in their A1 quarantine list as a risk for that region. Symptoms develop over several years; they include greenish-brown swellings which develop into black tumours (knots) on woody parts of the host; affected branches may die off; tree vigour and fruit production may be reduced.

The fungus overwinters in the knots. Spores are produced in humid conditions in spring and spread by wind or rain splash. Incidence in infected orchards (i.e. monocultures) can be high, but is usually low in woodlands in populations with mixed tree species. Disease management usually relies on pathogen exclusion, regular monitoring of orchards and phytosanitation (pruning affected limbs during the host dormancy season, removal or burning of infected tissue, disinfection of pruning tools).
