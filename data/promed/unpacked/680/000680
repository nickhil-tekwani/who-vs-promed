Russian woman faces jail over anthrax-infected meat
---------------------------------------------------
Prosecutors in Russia's Urals have brought criminal charges against a
woman who knowingly sold meat from a sick horse, infecting the buyers
with anthrax, a spokesman said on Friday [21 Nov 2008].

In August of this year, 11 residents of a village in the Yanaulsky
District of the Republic of Bashkiria were hospitalized and diagnosed
with anthrax after eating meat from an infected horse.

"Knowing that the horse was sick, she sold around 200 kilograms of
its meat," the Russian consumer rights regulator has said in a statement.

An investigation into how the horse became infected has been
launched. The woman faces up to 2 years in prison.

[Unfortunately Russia is not enthuisiastic about reporting anthrax
outbreaks to OIE. At the same time they investigate all human cases
and because this can result in fines and imprisonment the rural
population is not always completely frank. Thus their claims of human
cutaneous cases following hoeing cabbages. The quality of veterinary
services in rural areas is less than adequate and so we continually
get reports out of Russia of folk butchering animals affected with
anthrax, be they cattle or horses. At the same time livestock deaths
not involving humans seem to be under the surveillance radar and the
problem continues unabated.

Unfortunately, there are multiple places in this republic named Ural,
Andreevka and Yamandy, as well as Yanaul. - Mod.MHJ]
