After an animal died in Gunkiri town of Guroymak district and anthrax disease was detected in Degirmen village, the town and village were quarantined.

Veterinary teams operating in the district started vaccination studies at 6 points. Upon the death of a citizen's animal in Gunkiri town and the detection of diseased animals in Degirmen village, the sample taken by the teams of the District Provincial Directorate of Agriculture and Forestry was sent to the Elazig Veterinary Research Control Center Laboratory and the test was positive, and Gunkiri town and Degirmen village were quarantined.

In order to prevent the spread of the anthrax disease, it was decided to keep the village and town in quarantine for 15 days.

[To find Bitlis province on the western side of Lake Van in eastern Turkey, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitlis_Province.

Anthrax is enzootic in eastern Turkey and a constant problem, and the previous multiple outbreaks in 2018 were serious, with very significant numbers of livestock deaths. So far this outbreak in 2021 appears to involve livestock in Gunkin and Degirmen. How many has yet to be revealed. We hope their veterinary vaccination response is up to the challenge. That there were animal cases suggests that the cattle in these 2 sites had not been vaccinated this spring [2021]. Unfortunate, but a loud public lesson.

We previously posted an economic assessment of Turkish livestock production and health: see Anthrax - Turkey (08): economic background 20180925.6051600. It is worth reading in full, but a key component is this: "Ankara Chamber of Physicians President Vedat Bulut said the domestic meat market had been abandoned in favour of imports, and said the problems of meat producers were consciously ignored. 'The companies that import animals into Turkey don't pay any taxes, which is hugely profitable for them. Domestic production is taxed, but foreign production isn't. The idea was to keep the meat cheap for consumers, but in fact, the big corporations are getting richer while tens of thousands of farmers and ranchers are going under,' he said. 'One reason for the anthrax outbreak is that if domestic production is sacrificed to imports, we have to pull preventative medicine technicians and other public health officers from the field. There are veterinarians, animal technicians, and food and agricultural engineers all waiting for work, but the Ministry of Agriculture isn't hiring anyone. This means that production has no checks on it at all,' he said."

Anthrax is patently a serious human and livestock problem in this country, which is economically and politically stressed. Niche modelling shows that some 75% of the country is at serious risk. Put another way, if a livestock national control and surveillance programme were to be initiated, some 80% of the cattle would have to be vaccinated annually for at least 10 years before targeted area vaccination could be used to tidy up.
