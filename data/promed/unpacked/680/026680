The Federal Ministry of Health has revealed that the Darfur states are on the list of Sudanese states most stricken by schistosomiasis (bilharzia).

In particular the population of South Darfur is suffering from the disease. Bilharzia there has risen by 70 percent, which brings it to an equal level with the state of North Kordofan. "The mortality rates due to schistosomiasis are very high," an official of the Health Ministry reported to the press on Tuesday [6 May 2014]. There are no localities in Sudan free of bilharzia.

Schistosomiasis is a type of infection caused by parasites that live in fresh water, such as rivers or lakes, in subtropical and tropical regions worldwide. Symptoms can develop a few weeks after someone is infected, and include flu-like symptoms, such as a fever and muscle aches, skin rash, and coughing.

More serious symptoms can develop months, and possibly years, after infection, and include cystitis, blood in the urine, bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain or cramps, vomiting blood, and paralysis of the legs. Doctors refer to this as chronic schistosomiasis.

[Schistosomiasis is endemic in Sudan. A recent survey from Southern Kordofan State (Abou-Zeid AH et al. Schistosomiasis infection among primary school students in a war zone, Southern Kordofan State, Sudan: a cross-sectional study. BMC Public Health. 2013 Jul 11;13:643) found a prevalence of 27 percent in school children. Another survey from the River Nile State (Elmadhoun WM et al. Situation analysis of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthes in River Nile State, Sudan. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 2013 Mar;107(3):195-9) found that the prevalence of _Schistosoma haematobium_ in schoolchildren in the River Nile State was 1.7 percent with variation between localities (range = 0.58-3.5 percent). No _S. mansoni_ infection was detected, and the prevalence rate for intestinal helminthes was 0.1 percent. - Mod.EP
