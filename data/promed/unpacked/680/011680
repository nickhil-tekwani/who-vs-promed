A suspected outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Japan and South
Korea prompted some Asian governments on Tuesday to begin restricting meat
imports from those countries. Japan and Taiwan announced they had suspended
beef and pork imports from South Korea, which on Sunday discovered 2 head
of cattle in Kyonggi province near Seoul were infected with a vesicular
disease.
Japan's Agriculture Ministry said it is awaiting the outcome of a South
Korean government investigation to specify the type of vesicular disease,
and an import ban will be imposed if the outbreak is found to be FMD.
Taiwan's Council of Agriculture also said an import ban on South Korean
cloven-hoofed animals, their meat and dairy products would be imposed if
the outbreak proved to be FMD.
South Korea's state-run National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service
said its probe to identify the disease would take up to a week.
Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious, fatal illness affecting
cattle, hogs and other cloven-hoofed animals, although it cannot be
transmitted to humans.
"A ban could be a serious blow to South Korea's livestock industry, because
Japan is the biggest export market for South Korean pork," said a pork
trader at a major Japanese trade house.
Japan, too, is nervous about the spread of FMD after rushing to contain a
suspected outbreak of the disease on a cattle farm on the southernmost main
island of Kyushu at the weekend. The Japanese Agriculture Ministry said one
of 10 head of cattle at a farm in Miyazaki prefecture was suspected to be
infected with FMD. The ministry ordered the farm to kill all its cattle and
has begun inspecting other farms in the area for evidence of the disease.
Miyazaki prefecture, along with neighbouring Kumamoto and Kagoshima
prefectures, has imposed restrictions on the transport of cattle as a
precautionary measure, the ministry said.
If confirmed, it would be the first outbreak of the disease in Japan since
1908, a ministry official said.
