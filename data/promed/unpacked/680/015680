Monsoon has arrived, spreading infectious diseases like dengue and Japanese encephalitis. But, this time, the people of the state [of Andhra Pradesh] have to be a little more cautious since there is likelihood of mystery fevers gripping the state, say experts.

Both rural and urban areas are prone to these fevers, as can be deduced from the rising number of such cases in the recent past. With the symptoms of these fevers being similar to infectious diseases such as dengue and Japanese encephalitis, the doctors are facing a major challenge to zero in on a correct diagnosis. Unfortunately, in some cases these fevers also lead to multiple organ failure.

Last month [May 2013], several cases were reported in Chittoor district and other parts of Rayalaseema region. On the advice of the professors of virology of Sri Venkateswara [SV] University, tests were conducted on patients for scrub typhus (mite-borne) infection. Around 80 cases of scrub typhus were suspected in the district when tests were carried out in Tirupati.

In the same month [May 2013], there were reports of an increasing number of cases of scrub typhus in Tamil Nadu [state], and even deaths were reported in Chennai due to that viral infection. [Scrub typhus is caused by a rickettsia-like bacterium, _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, not a virus.] In September last year [2012], there were reports of scrub typhus cases in Hyderabad [in Andhra Pradesh state] also.

SV University virology professor DVR Sai Gopal has launched an awareness campaign [for scrub typhus] recently through pamphlets and radio programmes explaining this disease in Tirupati and other parts of Chittoor district.

"A person can get scrub typhus if he is bitten by a chigger (mite) that is infected with the bacteria. On being bitten by the mite, the bacteria are transmitted from the host to the victim," he explained.

The disease manifests 1-3 weeks after the bite of an infected chigger. Initial symptoms include moderate fever, severe headache, shaking chills, cough, conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, abdominal pain and nausea.

An eschar is formed like a cigarette burn on the part of the skin bitten by the mite. During the 2nd and 3rd week, if untreated, additional symptoms can include splenomegaly (enlargement of spleen), pneumonitis (lung infection), myocarditis (inflammation of heart muscle), encephalitis (infection of brain), meningitis (infection of the covering of brain), increased pulse rate, loss of consciousness and delirium.

The diagnosis of scrub typhus is based on the patient's exposure history, the clinical features and the results of serological tests like Weil-Felix text, ELISA [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay], western blot, immunoperoxidase, immunofluorescence and PCR [polymerase chain reaction].

"Early detection and necessary treatment can cure the patient by killing the bacteria. However, it will take time to become completely healthy again as the damaged tissue needs to recover," Sai Gopal said.

The mites can be present anywhere, even in air conditioned rooms, as the moisture levels in those rooms are high where mites can thrive. They could be present in carpets and on lawns outside.

"Since there is no vaccine to protect against scrub typhus, it is advisable for the people to adhere to hygiene. Avoid walking barefoot, do not sit or lie on bare ground or grass, and ensure the environs are clean and free of rubbish and dust," he said.

[_Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is the cause of scrub typhus, is transmitted by the bite of a chigger. Chiggers are the 6-legged juvenile form (larvae) of an 8-legged mite. The 6-legged parasitic larvae feed on skin cells of their animal hosts. After feeding, the larva drops to the ground, becomes a nymph, and then matures into an adult. In the post-larval stage, they are not parasitic and feed on plant materials. The mites live in the forests and grasslands and are also found in low vegetation of lawns, golf courses, and parks (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trombiculidae#Distribution). Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm). Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach on an area where the chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Patients with severe scrub typhus can develop multiorgan failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with hemorrhage. Establishing the diagnosis and initiating prompt antimicrobial drug therapy are important, because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 per cent (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/2/pdfs/v12-n2.pdf). Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline, and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation.

The Weil-Felix test, an agglutination test for the diagnosis of rickettsial disease, is based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. This test has poor sensitivity and specificity, but continues to be used in resource-poor regions (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf).

Rayalaseema is a geographic region in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayalaseema). It includes the southern district of Chittoor, which has a population of 4 170 468 according to a 2011 census of India (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittoor_district). For a map of Rayalaseema showing the district of Chittoor, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rayalaseema.png. A map of India showing the central location of the state of Andhra Pradesh is accessible at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm. Tirupati is a major pilgrimage and cultural city in the Chittoor district of India. It is the largest city in the Rayalaseema region (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirupati_(city)). - Mod.ML
