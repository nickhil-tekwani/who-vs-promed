Dear Colleague,

All of us who work with infectious diseases know that emerging diseases and pandemics cause catastrophic morbidity, mortality, and economic hardship, and may occur at any time. HIV has affected the lives of hundreds of millions of people worldwide. SARS cost an estimated UDS 30 billion from provision of health care in affected areas and in losses from disruption of commerce. Transboundary animal and plant diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and wheat rust pose serious risks to global agriculture and food security. H5N1 avian influenza has become endemic in parts of Asia, and H1N1 influenza emerged from the Americas to become a global pandemic in 2009. A novel coronavirus (MERS) has emerged in the Middle East. Knowing what disease will strike next, when it will emerge, where the outbreak will occur, and where it will spread would be enormously valuable in preparing for and possibly preventing outbreaks.

I recently represented ProMED at a workshop, "Predicting the Next Pandemic," hosted by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to explore the many initiatives to develop such predictive capability. Clearly, the evolution of information and communication technologies and the growing wealth of data sources is giving the infectious disease community a unique opportunity to encourage new approaches and methodologies to anticipate disease, estimate the potential for pandemic, and forecast how an outbreak will progress and what actions will mitigate its harm.

Whether aiming to predict seasonal or recurring disease threats or trying to predict where and how zoonoses will emerge in people, all of these approaches derive their predictive capacity from historical data and employ a constant stream of current information. ProMED is a primary source for both: for 2 decades, ProMED has provided detailed, comprehensive news and evidence-based information that help clinicians, scientists, and public health specialists understand what is happening around the globe. ProMED archives offer scientists and researchers 20 years of data on which to construct and test models.

As health professionals, we know that the best protections against the spread of illness are knowledge and the exchange of ideas. That's why, multiple times each day, ProMED brings the global infectious disease community accurate, relevant, and timely emerging infectious disease reporting without censorship or bias. That's why every day our expert editors, moderators, and reporters place the news into meaningful context with insightful commentary. Day after day, ProMED informs you about these diseases and helps you understand how they might affect you, your colleagues, your patients, your business, and your plans. But to maintain this level of coverage, ProMED-mail needs your support today. Please donate at http://www.isid.org/donate/netathon2013F.shtml.

The initiatives discussed at the White House meeting raise difficult and important questions: What are the drivers of emerging diseases? How do we monitor them to inform our predictions of spillover events? Can we predict when people will get sick before they need the healthcare system? Is it possible to anticipate the trajectory of an infectious agent that has already established human to human transmission to ensure adequate responses to pandemic threats? What are the new strategies for monitoring disease that will provide information that is as useful as possible? The data ProMED makes freely available every day will be the foundation on which the answers are built.

But for ProMED to remain an active force in the effort to develop predictive capability -- and to continue to provide validated, credible data every day -- we need your help. Please give generously to keep ProMED unfettered and free. Donate at http://www.isid.org/donate/netathon2013F.shtml. Your support now will help ensure that ProMED continues to meet the information needs of those who study infectious diseases, treat infected patients, protect the public health, and plan responses to future disease outbreaks. Thank you, and

Best wishes,
