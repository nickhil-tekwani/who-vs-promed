Creating an online atlas of Salmonella serotypes in Europe
----------------------------------------------------------
Salmonellosis is a frequently occurring disease in Europe. Through
their national surveillance systems, the European Union (EU) Member
States collect a substantial amount of information on cases of
salmonellosis, which may be used to gain new insights into the
epidemiological characteristics of the many different _Salmonella_
serotypes. One simple approach to this is by visualizing the spatial
distribution of the cases on maps. Geographic information systems
(GIS) are computer tools that help to map and analyse the spatial
distribution of cases. This may help to identify associations that
are not otherwise easily noticed.

In the project described here, we used GIS to depict the spatial
distribution of the most important _Salmonella_ serotypes in Europe.

Methods
-------
Data used in the project were national surveillance data of
laboratory-confirmed salmonellosis. The source of data was Enter-net
(<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/inter/enter-net_menu.htm>), the EU
dedicated surveillance network for the enteric infections
_Salmonella_ and verocytotoxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (VTEC)
O157, which has been collecting case-based data from participating
countries since 1994. These data are interesting in a GIS context
because they include a geographical variable indicating, within each
country, the region of residence of the patient or the region where
the diagnosis was made. In October 2007, the coordination of
Enter-net was transferred to the European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control (ECDC).

The project was put forward at the annual Enter-net workshop in 2005.
Subsequently, the data were cleaned and geo-coded in cooperation with
the Enter-net representatives of the countries that were interested
in taking part in the project. In addition to the Enter-net data,
several countries supplied data directly to the project. These were
Greece, Poland, Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany (the latter via
the <SurvStat@RKI system>). In total there were 1.6 million cases in
the dataset used.

The geographical information in the data was recoded according to the
Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics classification (NUTS,
<http://ec.europa.eu/comm/eurostat/ramon/nuts/home_regions_en.html>),
which is the official EU geographical division system. This system is
based on the existing geographical administrative divisions used in
the EU Member States. The maps were made using Arc-GIS software
[ESRI] and a website
(<http://www.epigis.dk>) was set up.

Results
-------
As a result of this project, maps were created showing the annual
incidence (number of cases per 100 000 inhabitants) of
laboratory-confirmed cases of the 10 most common _Salmonella
enterica_ serotypes (Enteritidis, Typhimurium, Virchow, Hadar,
Infantis, Newport, Derby, Agona, Saintpaul and Heidelberg) listed in
the Enter-net database. The maps cover all countries in Europe for
which data were available and which agreed to participate in the
project. In all, 30 countries were represented with data for at least
1 year within the period 1994-2006.

A total of 3 different annual series of maps were made. The 1st
simply show the annual incidence per country (Figure 1 [the figures
can be seen at the original URL - Mod.LL]). The 2nd series illustrate
the incidence at the district (sub-country) level (Figure 2). This
geographic level differs between countries; for example, in case of
Germany the states (Lander) are represented, in France they are
departments and in Denmark counties. The 3rd series show the serotype
data per district, giving percentage (rather than an incidence rate)
relative to the total number of annual reported _Salmonella_ cases
per district (Figure 3).

All maps are available at the _Salmonella_ Atlas website
(<http://www.epigis.dk>), where more information about the project
may also be found.

Discussion
----------
The maps we have created give an overview of the geographical
distribution of the cases of salmonellosis and allow for comparisons
between countries, thus making it easier to use the otherwise complex
data of the Enter-net Salmonella database. Furthermore, the maps are
presented in an easily accessible format on the Internet.

While the maps highlight areas with high or low incidences of a given
serotype, it is important to bear in mind that significant variations
between countries may be partly related to the large differences
between surveillance systems in European countries. As a result, it
is often not possible to compare incidence rates of salmonellosis
between countries directly, and in some instances it is even not
possible to make comparisons between various districts of a single
country. Therefore some background knowledge about the surveillance
systems in place in Europe is needed when interpreting the maps. For
this reason, a note is added to each map, stating that the maps
should be interpreted with caution due to the existing differences in
surveillance and reporting.

Furthermore, we attempted to adjust for the overall differences of
the _Salmonella_ surveillance systems in each region by making a
series of maps that show the number of cases of a given serotype in
relation to the total number of diagnosed _Salmonella_ cases. These
maps provide a picture of how important a given serotype is in the
different countries and districts.

Although GIS can be a very powerful tool in descriptive epidemiology,
geographical location data are often not routinely collected as part
of disease surveillance. Few European disease datasets exist that
(like the _Salmonella_ dataset) are both fairly large and contain
information about where within a country the incident took place. We
think it is useful to ask for location variables when collecting data
at regional, national or international institutions. Such location
data should refer to well-defined geographical areas; for example, in
case of the EU follow the NUTS system of classification.

We hope that these maps will be useful for epidemiologists when
making trend analyses and investigating outbreaks. In their current
form the maps may not be sufficiently flexible to fulfil all these
goals, but we are continuing to develop this project and plan in the
near future to construct a dynamic web-based mapping-tool that will
allow users to set a number of parameters and be presented with a map
drawn from an underlying database. In this way, it will be possible
to create maps which present much more data, including depictions of
the full list of serotypes, different age groups, phage types and
other information such as whether or not the infections were travel-related.
