Morarano village, 40 km east of Moramanga, has been hit by the
plague; 3 persons of the same family have died in recent days and
4 people died one by one of plague in Ambohidray station, a rural
commune of Morarano in the district of Moramanga, according to the
declaration of death made to basic health center (CSB) Level II,
Morarano.

A 20-year-old was the 1st victim on 6 Oct 2008. He caught the disease
while keeping his parents' cattle in the field at Ampasimbe, a village
which is located 15 km from the town. Field rats, common in this
region, are the reservoir of the disease. In ignorance of the cause
of the death, he was buried in the family vault.

The alert was triggered by learning of the death of the father 2 days
later. The mother also soon died. The test strip to confirm that it was
the plague was positive. She presented symptoms of pneumonic plague
-- cough with bloody sputum -- said Dr Mamitiana Raveloarijaona,
medical director of the CSB Morarano.

People panicked when another young man of 16 years died on 15 Oct
2008. He lived in the Ampandrana district near Ambohidray station.
Two more fever patients are still under treatment. Approximately 400
people have received basic treatment with sulfadoxine because they
are in contact with the outbreak of plague, said the chief doctor of
Morarano.

Plague follows an epidemiological cycle in Madagascar. According to
Dr. Rolland Robinson, director of emergencies and the fight against
diseases (DULM), we are in the year of its return, which happens
every 5 years. In such a context, the population must be sensitized
to clean the environment. "We must trap the rats alive and kill them
by throwing them into fire or water to kill their fleas along with
them," he suggests [if they are killed in the trap, their fleas
disperse. - Mod.JW]. In any case, Madagascar is home to several
plague foci; Moramanga, in the region of Alaotra Mangoro, is one of
them.

[It is likely that primary pneumonic plague occurred in the parents
of the family. Primary pneumonic plague (one percent of natural
plague presentations) arises as a result of inhalation of plague
bacilli in infectious aerosols, such as would be produced when there
are secondary pneumonic complications in bubonic/septicemic plague.

Primary plague pneumonia has a short incubation period of 1-3 days,
after which there is sudden onset of flu-like symptoms including
fever, chills, headache, generalized body pains, weakness and chest
discomfort. A cough develops with sputum production, which may be
bloody, and increasing chest pain and difficulty in breathing. As the
disease progresses, hypoxia (low oxygen concentration in the blood)
and hemoptysis (coughing up blood) are prominent. The disease is
invariably fatal unless antimicrobial therapy commences within 24
hours of exposure.

Patients with primary pneumonic plague generate large quantities of
infectious aerosols that pose a significant risk to close contacts.
CDC guidelines identify contacts within 2 meters as being at greatest
risk and do not consider the organism likely to be carried through
air ducts or vents. Persons who have been in contact with pneumonic
plague patients or handling potentially infectious body fluids or
tissues without appropriate protection should receive preventive
antimicrobial therapy. The preferred antimicrobial agents for
prophylaxis are tetracyclines, quinolones, or chloramphenicol.

Moramanga is in the Alaotra-Mangoro region of the eastern Toamasina
province of Madagascar. The province can be seen on a map of the
island nation at:

A test using dipsticks for the rapid diagnosis of plague, developed
and evaluated at the Institut Pasteur in Madagascar and Paris, makes
it possible to detect this disease in 15 minutes at a patient's
bedside. This research was published in the 18 Jan 2003 edition of
"The Lancet":
