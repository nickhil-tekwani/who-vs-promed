Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: equine infectious anemia was confirmed on 3 Oct 2012 in a 10-year-old gelding based on positive results obtained on the AGID (Coggin's test).

An epidemiological inquiry is currently under way.

Control measures
Measures applied: control of arthropods; stamping out; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; dipping/spraying; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA), Weybridge (regional reference laboratory)

A horse in Cornwall has been put down after tests confirmed it had the rare and highly contagious disease, swamp fever [equine infectious anemia (EIA)].

The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the animal tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA). 20 other horses at the same stable yard have been quarantined and are being tested for the disease.

It is the 1st recorded case of swamp fever in the UK this year [2012].

EIA is a viral disease that attacks a horse's immune system and is transmitted through the exchange of blood by biting insects, such as flies and midges. In can result in death and cause pregnant mares to abort.

Infection trail
---------------
Only a few cases have been recorded in the UK over the past 30 years -- with the last cases in the South West 2 years ago.

Defra said it could not say where the horse was stabled, but said restrictions had been placed on the yard as investigations were carried out to establish how the horse contracted EIA.

A spokeswoman said the affected horse was brought over from Belgium 5 years ago and vets are now tracing its travel movements within the UK.

Defra said EIA posed no danger to humans and there was no evidence that this outbreak presented a risk to the local community.

Chief Veterinary Officer Nigel Gibbens said: "All the necessary precautions to prevent disease spread, including movement restrictions on the sick horse and others at the same stables, were put in place as soon as we became aware of the animal's illness.

"We have also begun a thorough investigation to ascertain whether any other horses may have been exposed to infection.

"Equine infectious anemia is a serious disease but it can be contained by finding infected horses and removing them so that they do not infect others."

[Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a persistent viral infection of equids. The causative agent, EIA virus (EIAV), is a lentivirus in the family _Retroviridae_, subfamily _Orthoretrovirinae_. Other members of the lentivirus genus include: bovine immunodeficiency virus; caprine arthritis encephalitis virus; feline immunodeficiency virus; human immunodeficiency virus 1; human immunodeficiency virus 2; and maedi/visna virus. EIA can be diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs, pathological lesions, serology, and molecular methods. Infected horses remain viremic carriers for life and, with very rare exceptions, yield a positive serological test result. Antibody response usually persists and antibody-positive animals, older than 6-8 months, are identified as virus carriers (below 6-8 months of age, serological reactions can be due to maternal antibodies; status can be confirmed by molecular techniques). Infected equids are potential virus reservoirs. Biting flies are mechanical vectors for the virus in nature.

The disease is not zoonotic; no vaccine is available.
