Japanese health officials recorded 128 additional syphilis cases the week ending 23 Oct 2021, pushing the case total for the year [2021] so far over 6000, with 2 months left to go. According to the Japan National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo, 6031 total syphilis cases have been reported to date. Of this total, 1891, or 31% of the cases, were reported in Tokyo.

In 2017, Japan saw 5534 syphilis cases, the 1st time that happened in more than 4 decades. This was followed by 2 consecutive years with more than 6000 cases -- prior to 2018, the last time Japan saw more than 6000 syphilis cases was 48 years ago. Syphilis was a major issue in Japan until shortly after the end of World War II, but the total reported cases declined to several hundred annually until 2011, when a rebound began.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that can cause long-term complications if not treated correctly. Symptoms of syphilis in adults include a painless sore that will go away without treatment followed by a non-itchy body rash. If left untreated, syphilis can lead to damage through the body including neurological and cardiovascular complications. Syphilis also increases the risk of HIV infection and, for women, can cause problems during pregnancy and for the newborn.

[Although not stated, the number of cases of syphilis each year reported above are total cases, which include cases of primary and secondary syphilis (the most contagious forms of syphilis), latent ("asymptomatic") syphilis, tertiary ("late symptomatic") syphilis, and congenital syphilis (see the National Institute of Infectious Diseases [NIID] Infectious Agents Surveillance Report below, table at https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/images/iasr/2020/1/479tt01.gif), with 4575 total cases in 2016, 5826 in 2017, and 7007 in 2018. In 2019, there were 6577 total cases; in 2020, 6923 cases. From the NIID table, in recent years, about 70% of the total cases each year in Japan are cases of primary and secondary syphilis.

The incidence of primary and secondary syphilis that initially involved mainly men who have sex with men has more recently also involved women in their 20s and 30s (see the NIID Infectious Agents Surveillance Report below). The increase in the incidence of syphilis in women of childbearing age has been associated with a rising incidence of congenital syphilis in Japan.

Syphilis, Japan

"...Although changes in surveillance should be noted, the number of notified syphilis cases has declined significantly since 1948 (Fig. 1) [https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/images/iasr/2020/1/479tef01.gif]. The number of notifications had been on a decreasing trend as a whole, although minor epidemics that peaked in 1967, 1972, 1987, 1999, and 2008 were observed. However, the number increased after 2010 and has increased rapidly until 2018. The total number of notified syphilis cases in 2015-2018 was 20 098, which consisted of 13 641 males (68%) and 6457 females (32%) (as of 2 Oct 2019). Among them, 14 017 [69.7%] were early symptomatic syphilis (6924 primary and 7093 secondary), 459 were late symptomatic syphilis, 5568 were asymptomatic syphilis, and 54 were congenital syphilis (Table) [https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/images/iasr/2020/1/479tt01.gif]. Since 2015, 9-17 cases of congenital syphilis have been reported annually, and the number has been increasing in recent years. The incidence rate per 100 000 population was 2.1 in 2015 and 5.5 in 2018. The average annual incidence rate by prefecture was the highest in Tokyo, followed by Osaka and Okayama (see pp. 6 & 8 of this issue).

"In both men and women, early symptomatic syphilis, which reflects the trend of patients in the early stage of _Treponema pallidum_ infection, accounted for the majority (Fig. 2) [https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/images/iasr/2020/1/479tf02.gif]. Regarding the reported age distribution of early symptomatic syphilis, it peaked in the 20s for females, whereas males had a broad peak in their 20s to 40s (Fig. 2) and increased in the same age group after 2015 (Fig. 3) [https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/images/iasr/2020/1/479tf03.gif]. A total of 555 patients (male: 188, female: 367) younger than 20 years were reported between 2015 and 2018. Regarding the routes of infection, for males, infections by heterosexual contact have been higher than infections by homosexual contact since 2015 and surpassed infections by homosexual contact, which had increased slightly until 2018 (Fig. 4). For females, the majority of infections were caused by heterosexual contact and the increase was also due to this infection (Fig. 4) [https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/images/iasr/2020/1/479tf04.gif].

"Effective 1 Jan 2019, the following were added to the survey on infectious disease outbreaks: pregnancy, HIV infection, history of syphilis infection, history of working in and using the sex industry, and presence of oral or pharyngeal lesions. Based on preliminary data, the number of notifications of pregnant syphilis cases was more than 200 per year (see p. 9 of this issue)." - Mod.ML
