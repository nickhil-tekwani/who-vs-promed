HEMOLYTIC UREMIC SYNDROME - AUSTRALIA (SOUTH AUSTRALIA)(02)

It has not yet been established that the 3 cases are "genetically
matched," they are similar. We are running further tests to determine
how closely they are related.
The case with hemolytic uremic syndrome was not one of the confirmed
_E. coli_ O157 cases. Since this posting, Shiga toxin gene testing on
feces from this case has been completed and is negative, although it
is over a week since this case recovered from diarrheal illness.
Increased testing for STEC has been instituted in clinical
laboratories since these cases were detected, and of almost 200
specimens tested, there have been no further positive results.
Interviews of all 4 cases have not revealed a common source of infection.
Additionally, the Garibaldi outbreak mentioned in the posting was _E.
coli_ O111, not O157.
