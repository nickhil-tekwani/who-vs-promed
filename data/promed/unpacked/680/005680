Zimbabwe's Agriculture Ministry on Tuesday [12 Jan 2010] reported a
fresh outbreak of anthrax in some parts of the country.

Veterinary Services director Stewart Hargreaves told ZimOnline that
his department has recorded fresh reports of an outbreak [sic] of the
deadly livestock disease. "There has been an outbreak over the past 2
weeks. The outbreak has been recorded in Chegutu, Karoi, Kadoma and
Chinhoyi," said Hargreaves. "The situation is under control; there is
no need to panic because anthrax is a common disease. It's in the soil."

While Zimbabwe experiences periodic outbreaks of anthrax, especially
during the rainy season, veterinary experts say the high incidence of
outbreaks in recent years is partly fuelled by lawlessness and chaos
in the farming sector where hardline supporters of President Robert
Mugabe have continued invading farms.

"The disease is made worse by the constant movement of livestock on
farms because of continuing invasions," the Commercial Farmers Union
said in a statement last week. The union represents the country's few
remaining white commercial farmers.

The anthrax outbreak comes at a time Zimbabwe's government is battling
to rebuild the national herd that was severely depleted by droughts
and a chaotic land reform exercise that began a decade ago.

For Kadoma, see Chegutu link and continue out on highway A5.
For Chinhoyi, northwest of Harare, go to:

These outbreaks (plural) are further out from Harare than those in
previous reports. This expanding series of outbreaks are patently a
severe problem for the veterinary authorities. Where there is
lawlessness in the countryside, it is impossible to deploy veterinary
assistants to get stock collected up and vaccinated. - Mod.MHJ]
