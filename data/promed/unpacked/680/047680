The Argentinean Minister of Health, after recognizing the increasing number of pertussis cases, urged the citizens to take preventive measures, particularly all pregnant women from 20 weeks gestation, who must have their vaccines administered, and he also indicated that every child must have his/her vaccination schedule completed. During 2011, the Laboratory Surveillance System (SIVILA, according to its Spanish initials) reported 1594 confirmed (pertussis) cases and 70 deaths in children less than one year old, and 91 percent of the total reported deaths occurred in children less than 4 years of age.

In 2011, notified cases were above the expected figures, and this situation was also observed in other countries in this region, such as the USA, Cuba, Chile, and Uruguay. These countries, together with Argentina, had pertussis outbreaks during 2011.

For the current year, 2012, data recorded in SIVILA up to the 16th epidemiological week (16-22 Apr 2012) indicates that there had been 2207 cases notified as compatible with pertussis, and 568 of them were reported to be positive for _Bordetella pertussis_.

Dr. Carla Vizotti, Head of the National Control Program for Immuno-Preventable Diseases, declared that "this data indicates a number of suspected cases, confirming that we are still in the midst of an outbreak as it occurred in 2011." The specialist pointed out that "pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a very contagious acute respiratory infection, and it is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in children." She added: "It is necessary to have boosters in vaccination, and we need to have a good vaccine coverage in order to stop the microorganism from circulating."

The Argentinean Ministry of Health, alongside scientific societies who participate in the National Commission for Immunizations (CONIN, according to its Spanish initials), recommended in 2012 that a supplementary strategy -- purchasing and delivering vaccines to every province in the country -- should be developed, with the objective of immunizing 750 000 pregnant women during 2012. "With this measure, we will protect infants from the time they are born until the time they acquire immunity through vaccination," said Dr. Vizzotti.

With this reemergence of disease associated with _Bordetella pertussis_, reports from the WHO pointed out that there are 50 million pertussis cases per year all over the world, and the death rate is 350 000 persons per year.

[As in Argentina, recommendations on the use of acellular pertussis vaccines in the USA have continued to expand in efforts to cocoon susceptible neonates to prevent the substantial morbidity and mortality in infants who have not been yet adequately immunized, like the ones described in this report. The use of the vaccine in pregnant women to provide passive immunity is a further expansion of these recommendations. It is likely, given the limited number of contacts small infants have, that the reservoir of the infant is a family member.

The increasing susceptibility in older children and adults to pertussis, usually manifesting as chronic cough without the typical "whoop," after appropriate primary immunization continues to be increasingly reported. Waning immunity is generally thought to be the cause of the problem, but it is increasingly clear that _Bordetella pertussis_ clones are being selected by the acellular vaccine, against which we are no longer as well protected with the current vaccines. - Mod.LL
