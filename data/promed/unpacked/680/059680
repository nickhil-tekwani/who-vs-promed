Soybean cyst nematodes [SCN] are almost invisible without
magnification, says George W. Bird -- but if left unchecked, they can
destroy soybean farms. The SCN is a small roundworm that attacks the
roots of soybeans, said Bird, a professor and nematologist with the
Department of Entomology at Michigan State University Extension in
East Lansing.
SCN, discovered in Japan in 1934, arrived in North Carolina in 1954.
It traveled the Mississippi River to soybean country, where it
flourished. The worm appeared in Michigan in Gratiot County in 1987.
SCN has now reached 39 counties in the state, which comprise more
than half of the state's soybean crop, Bird said. Once present in the
soil, SCN can never be eliminated. However, farmers can manage them.
Losses can range from 5 bushels an acre to the entire crop.
Each nematode can contain about 250 eggs. When they drop off, they
can remain viable in the soil for up to 12 years in the absence of a
host. Growers can mistake plant damage for nutrient deficiencies,
drought stress, herbicide injury, or other plant diseases.
The 1st symptoms of nematode injury in the field are circular or oval
areas of stunted, yellowed plants that vary in size, often showing a
sharp dividing line between stunted and healthy plants, Bird said.
Scientists have tried to naturally develop SCN-resistant seeds. Bird
spoke about nematodes and resistant seeds to about 30 growers and
seed company representatives at the farms of Greg Mahoney in St.
Charles Township and Jon E. Oakes in Albee Township. Mark Seamon, MSU
Extension agriculture agent for Saginaw County, helped coordinate the
event.
In the Oakes plot, plants from resistant seeds fared much better than
those from nonresistant seeds. Nematode-resistant varieties generally
have 1 of 3 sources of resistance -- Peking, PI 88788 or PI 437654.
Historically, most varieties are derived from PI 88788.
In the Albee Township trials, 25 of 45 varieties were PI 88788, a
"plant introduction" number the national United States Department of
Agriculture designated to the variety. However, many seed companies
used the PI 88788 resistance series -- a breeding line -- in a host
of varieties, so no 2 were the same. The lowest counts were Pioneer's
91M80, Dyna Gro's 3221, Asgrow's AG2405, Lathum Seeds' E2611 and
Midwest seeds' GR2831 -- all of which were free of SCN.
The most important factors in fighting infestation are good rotation
and increasing soil organic matter, Bird said. Manure, if available,
pays off well.

[_Heterodera glycines_, the soybean cyst nematode [SCN] is a major
limiting factor in Michigan soybean production. First detected in
Michigan in 1987, it is known to exist in almost all of Michigan's
major soybean-producing counties. SCN infestations can result in poor
stands, stunted plants, yellow foliage and low soybean yields. Losses
can range from 5 percent to 90 percent of the yield potential.
Michigan soybean growers need to have a well-developed strategy to
avoid SCN problems or to minimize impacts if SCN is already present.
It is a problem for soybean producers as well as a regulatory concern
for growers wishing to export seed or plant material to other states
or countries, many of which will not accept seed or plant material
unless it is certified SCN-free. It is important that growers using
land that has been previously planted to soybeans have their fields
sampled routinely if they wish to export seed or plant material.
SCN has 3 major life stages: egg, juvenile, and adult. Juvenile
stages feed on roots as they continue to develop into either adult
males or females. Affected plants express above-ground symptoms such
as plant stunting and yellowing. SCN females can be observed on the
root systems of soybeans around 45 days after planting. They are
small white spheres about the size of the head of a pin and are found
attached to the roots of the host plant. As the females mature, they
turn brown and become a protective cyst for their eggs that can
remain viable in the soil for many years. Each cyst may contain up to
several hundred eggs that will eventually hatch when a suitable host
is present. SCN hosts are mainly legumes such as soybeans, dry beans,
and snap beans but it has also been known to survive on some winter
annual weed species.
Monitoring for SCN is an essential part of nematode management. All
fields in Michigan should be routinely sampled for nematodes,
preferably every fall before soybeans are planted. Early detection is
critical to avoid drastic yield losses and high population densities
of SCN. Sampling for SCN and other plant-parasitic nematodes is
described in Michigan State University [MSU] AG Facts Bulletin
E-2199, Detecting and Avoiding Nematode Problems. Samples consisting
of roots, soil or both can be submitted to Diagnostic Services at MSU
for nematode analyses.
Lateral movement of SCN is slow, about an inch a year on its own.
However, SCN can be transported over long distances in soil
associated with crop transplants (e.g., tomato, strawberry,
ornamentals), on machinery, animals, and with seed. Movement of soil
should be minimized. Fields without SCN should always be worked and
harvested before infested fields. To minimize the spread of SCN,
equipment should always be washed free of soil after working in
SCN-infested fields.
Reduction of SCN is the strategy used for minimizing risks in
SCN-fields. Once a field is infested with SCN it is virtually
impossible to eradicate it. If SCN is present in a field, the
objective in most situations is to reduce the population density.
This can be achieved by growing non-host crops, maintaining good weed
management, and incorporating SCN-resistant soybean varieties into
cropping schemes. Currently, there are a very limited number of
nematicides registered for control of SCN, and the economics of
nematicide use for control of SCN in Michigan have not been justified.
Recommendations for SCN management will vary depending on population
densities and the production needs of the grower. When samples are
submitted to Diagnostic Services at MSU, a nematode diagnostician
will provide recommendations to growers to assist them in
implementing appropriate SCN management strategies. Apparently no SCN
has been detected in the Upper Peninsula region of the state as of
May 2004.
