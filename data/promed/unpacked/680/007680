CANINE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY - NORWAY (02)
==============================================

From: Oz <Oz@upthorpe.demon.co.uk>
The suggestion that a Norwegian dog has a TE from imported UK dogfood is
probably one of the more unlikely explanations. The UK, known as a country
of doglovers has a vastly higher population of dogs than Norway and had
definitely fed it's dogs food contaminated with BSE from the very beginning
of the outbreak. I don't think anyone would dispute this.
Yet astonishingly, so far as I am aware, not a single suspected case of a
TSE in UK dogs has ever been observed. This is in marked contrast to cats
where it was picked up very quickly.
So BSE as a cause seems unlikely.
However I would be interested to know if the equivalent of the Elk TSE
[chronic wasting disease in Elk, also occuring in Mule Deer.-Mod pc] occurs
in the Norwegian equivalent species. This is interesting as it is the only
natural case of a herbivore TSE that I know of. I also wonder if there is
any known connection between mink TSE and mink fed on elk.
I would remind readers that the natural source of the infection that caused
BSE is still unknown. It wasn't scrapie and no natural TSE of domestic
cattle has ever been recorded.
