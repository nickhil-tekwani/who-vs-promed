Meat recalled after hospital deaths
-----------------------------------
A massive recall of small goods has been ordered in South Australia, as the
government struggles to find the source of an outbreak of [infection with]
listeria bacteria that killed 2 hospital patients. Health minister John
Hill yesterday, 12 Dec 2005, released a list of pre-cooked meat products
made by Conroy's Smallgoods -- including ham, mettwurst, and salami --
after testing found listeria on cutting equipment at the company's suburban
Adelaide plant.
Conroy's is a 50 year old South Australian producer of about 120 meat
products. It is a family owned and operated company that employs more than
100 people and sells more than AUD 10 million [around USD 7.5 million] in
products each year. Mr. Hill said testing at Conroy's had found listeria
bacteria on the plant's saw, conveyor, slicer block, floor drains and
cryovac machine, and in the slicer room.
Listeriosis is a serious infection caught from food contaminated with
_Listeria monocytogenes_, a bacterium widely found in nature and sometimes
in raw foods.
Mr Hill said recalled products included ready-to-eat champagne ham,
mettwurst, pastrami, and sandwich ham. The ban did not extend to products
that needed to be cooked, such as bacon, bacon bones, and ham steaks. The
products were regularly supplied to the Royal Adelaide Hospital, where one
of the victims died, and were available from retail outlets and
wholesalers. He said there was no direct link yet made between Conroy's
meats and the outbreak, which may be established by the results of further
testing this week [3rd week December 2005].
Conroy's managing director Pat Conroy confirmed the company's meat products
were supplied to hospitals, including Royal Adelaide, but said his company
was not a direct supplier. He said the recall of its meat products was a
"serious matter" and the company would cooperate with Health Department
officials as testing continued this week [3rd week December 2005].
The 2 patients who died were already sick in hospital with low immune
systems, but listeria was later detected in the kitchens at the hospitals
where they had been treated, the Royal Adelaide Hospital and Gawler
Hospital, north of Adelaide. 2 other patients who had listeriosis were
prescribed antibiotics and are recovering.
The Health Department yesterday [12 Dec 2005] reissued a warning to those
at a high risk of listeriosis, including pregnant women and those with low
immune systems. They should not consume ready to eat cold meats, cold
cooked chicken, pate, or raw and chilled ready to eat seafoods.

[Nosocomial listeriosis has been described before in similar circumstances,
related to food service in health care facilities, but is quite uncommon. -
