A total of 7 people have needed hospital treatment as part of a _Salmonella_ outbreak in France linked to dry pork sausages. In total, 31 cases of salmonellosis have been detected by the National Reference Center for _Salmonella_ at Institut Pasteur. Illness because of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Bovismorbificans has mostly affected young people with at least 17 children sick.

Strains were isolated from patients between [22 Sep 2020 and 14 Nov 2020]. The onset of symptoms ranged from [22 Sep 2020 to 10 Nov 2020]. Patients live in 7 different parts of the country while the Grand-Est region has the most cases with 16. 14 men and 17 women have been confirmed sick, ranging in age from 1 to 69 years old. 7 patients were hospitalized but no deaths reported.

Investigation findings
----------------------
Almost all patients had eaten dried pork sausage of one brand bought in several locations of the same supermarket chain, according to the [French National Public Health Agency]. The link between illness and eating dry cold meats manufactured by France Salaisons was previously made by the Directorate General for Food (DGAL), Directorate General for Health, and [French National Public Health Agency]. The company is based in the Rhone region of France.

Potentially contaminated product has also been recalled in Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, and Slovenia. In France, a withdrawal and recall of several batches of dry sausage of the Saint Azay brand sold at E Leclerc stores has taken place. France Salaisons also withdrew and recalled certain lots and dates of rosette de Lyon 15 slices of the Saint Alby brand and rosette pre-sliced in 15 slices of the Le Flutiau make. Monterrat used rosette manufactured by France Salaisons on some club rosette sandwiches, prompting a recall.
