Poisonous caterpillar outbreak in Germany closes schools
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of poisonous caterpillars in Germany has led to school and
kindergarten closures, municipal authorities said.
Contact with the stiff-haired spines (i.e. urticating hairs) of oak
processionary caterpillars, which have multiplied by the thousands in
recent days in trees in the central state of Hesse, can lead to skin rashes
and asthma attacks, a spokesman for the town of Dreieich said.
On Tuesday [14 Jun 2005], a local day care center was shuttered, and a
school in the town of Roedermark Ober Roden closed for 2 days in June
[2005], as a result of the outbreak.
Exterminators dressed from head-to-toe in protective gear have set to work
destroying and removing the cocoons from school yards in the area. Because
the caterpillars prefer sunlight to shade, they tend to multiply in parks
and playgrounds as opposed to the forest.
Authorities said an unusually warm and dry 2003 had initially drawn the
insects to Germany from their preferred habitats in regions farther south.

[The oak processionary caterpillars are the larvae of a moth, _Thaumetopoea
processionea_, a species that is widely distributed in central and southern
Europe and occasionally found in more northern countries, such as The
Netherlands, Sweden and the UK. As is to be expected from its name, the
caterpillar feeds on oak leaves and, occasionally, on leaves of walnut
trees. Older caterpillars, that is 3rd to 6th larval instars, are covered
with numerous (estimated at 63 000 per fully grown larva!) pointed
poisonous hairs (setae) that contain an urticating toxin (thaumetopoein).
Their purpose is defensive, to protect against predators. Similar hairs are
found in the caudal tuft of adult moths, but it is the larvae that cause
most problems. When people come into contact with air-borne hairs, they can
cause pruritus, dermatitis, conjunctivitis and occasionally respiratory
distress, including asthma. A papular rash is a common symptom (useful
references are Maier, H. et al. (2003) British Journal of Dermatology 149:
990-997 and Diaz, J.H. (2005) American Journal of Tropical Medicine and
Hygiene, 72: 347-357).
In 1995, 165 soldiers and civilians from the U.S. military base in
Heidelberg sought treatment for acute dermatitis resulting from exposure to
hairs of oak processionary caterpillars (Hesler, L.S. et al. (1999)
Military Medicine, 164: 767-770).
There are many other moth species that cause various forms of dermatitis in
various countries, from the Americas to Asia. (Incidentally, in southeast
Asia, there are moths (_Calyptra_ species) whose proboscis is modified for
piercing the skin of mammals and sucking up blood). - Mod.MS]
