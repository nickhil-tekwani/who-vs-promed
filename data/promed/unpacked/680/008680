["Scrapie is a neurodegenerative disease of sheep and goats. So-called 'atypical' scrapie is clinically, pathologically, biochemically, and epidemiologically unrelated to 'classical' scrapie, is likely to be non-contagious and a spontaneous degenerative condition of older sheep and rarely of goats." (https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.07.11_SCRAPIE.pdf)

The last known case of scrapie in Iceland was reported to the OIE on 28 Jan 2019; it involved a sheep flock of 375 head in Alftagerdi, Skagafjordur, Northland West. The entire flock was culled ("killed and disposed of") and the event declared resolved on 1 Feb 2019. See event summary and updated map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=29341.

Regulation pertaining to the eradication of scrapie and compensation for culling in Iceland is available at https://www.mast.is/static/files/library/Regluger√∞ir/651_2001ReglugerdUtryminguariduveikiogbaeturEN1505.pdf.

Abstract
--------
Introduction
"Since 1978 Iceland has actively screened healthy slaughtered (HS) sheep for scrapie, however, in 2004 the screening method changed from histopathological staining to a rapid ELISA test. With this new method scrapie cases in HS were identified for the first time, as before index scrapie cases had only been detected in sheep with clinical symptoms (CS). Use of this sensitive method also led to the detection of the first atypical scrapie case (Nor98) in Iceland in 2004."

Materials and Methods
"During 2004-2018 there were 50,515 HS samples tested with ELISA, along with 558 samples from fallen stock and clinical suspects. In this overview, the cases detected during this time, will be analysed further, such as origin, age, PrP genotype and number of additional cases from each farm detected after culling of the scrapie flock."

Results
"In the years 2004-2018 there were 29 scrapie cases identified, where one case refers to a single affected farm. Two thirds of the classical scrapie cases originate from CS sheep, while Nor98 is generally identified in HS samples rather than CS. The genotype most associated with susceptibility to classical scrapie is frequent in the classical scrapie cases, however a neutral genotype is found in many of those cases as well. After culling, where a scrapie flock (or a portion of it) was tested, additional positive samples of classical scrapie were frequently detected, but only once has an additional Nor98 case been found in a culled flock."

Conclusion
"The comparison of classical and atypical scrapie in Iceland shows that they have many different qualities in relation to origin, symptoms, genotype, and flock infectivity."
