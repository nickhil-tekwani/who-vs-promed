The following is in response to the moderator's question concerning the
Pennsylvania "connection" with the pseudorabies infected premises in New
Jersey and will, hopefully, provide a more accurate picture of the current
situation in Pennsylvania.
The last known new case of pseudorabies in Pennsylvania was diagnosed in
September 1997. The last known pseudorabies infected herd was released from
quarantine in March 1999. Extensive testing in the high risk areas of
Lancaster and surrounding counties was conducted during the past year with
negative results. At this time, there are no known infected herds/pigs and
none under quarantine in Pennsylvania.
One can only speculate, at this point, on the length of time that the New
Jersey farm has been infected. If infected feeder pigs were the source of
infection, any one of several feeder pig purchases during the past year
could have been the source. All purchases were reportedly through a
Lancaster County livestock market. This market has consistently operated in
compliance with State regulations, met USDA requirements for "approved
feeder pig market" status and had a policy of only selling feeder pigs that
originated from monitored/tested herds. Unfortunately, monitored herd
status does not guarantee that a herd has not become infected since the
last annual herd test.
The Pennsylvania herds of origin for feeder pigs consigned to the infected
New Jersey farm during the past year have been identified and their test
history evaluated. As part of the ongoing investigation, those herds that
have not tested recently will be tested.

[I appreciate Dr. DeBok's response which clarifies the matter. Is there a
similar connection in why the animals were sent to Indiana for
incineration? - Mod.TG
