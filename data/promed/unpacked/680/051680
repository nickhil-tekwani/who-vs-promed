Scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey [USGS] and its partners have shown how brucellosis, a disease which has significant economic implications for the cattle industry and wildlife health, has been transmitted back and forth between cattle, bison and elk in the greater Yellowstone [National Park, Wyoming] area.

The research focused on wildlife-livestock transmission pathways of a disease called brucellosis, which often causes a termination of pregnancy in animals. The disease was unintentionally introduced to elk and bison in the greater Yellowstone area on at least 5 separate occasions over the past century, but, more recently, is transmitting from elk to cattle and undermining livestock control efforts.

"This study provides the most definitive evidence to date that brucellosis is now self-sustaining in Montana elk and has spread at an increased rate in elk populations outside of the feeding grounds," said Pauline Kamath, USGS ecologist and lead author of the study.

Federal scientists developed and analyzed a genomic dataset of _Brucella abortus_, the bacteria that causes brucellosis, which spanned 30 years and included samples from cattle, bison and elk. Four out of the 5 strains are now primarily associated with elk and originated from the Wyoming feeding grounds, where state and federal land managers provide feed for elk in the winter.

Two of these elk-associated strains have spread at about 4 to 8 kilometers [about 2.5 to 5 miles] per year. Scientists conclude that elk are the most likely source of current brucellosis outbreaks in livestock.

The 5th genetically-distinct strain originated and was mainly found in bison of Yellowstone National Park. This strain appeared to be spreading less rapidly.

Previously, it was not known whether elk could sustain the disease in the absence of bison or supplemental feeding grounds. This study shows that elk, in some areas distant from the feeding grounds, have strains that are unrelated to bison, suggesting that management of bison and feeding grounds may not affect brucellosis dynamics in these other elk populations, where the disease has been spreading.

"Any attempt to control the rate of spread in wildlife must be evaluated at the ecosystem scale and include an effective strategy to address infection in elk across the greater Yellowstone area. Focus on bison alone, as was suggested in the past, will not meet the disease eradication objective and conserve wildlife," said the National Park Service's Rick Wallen, lead wildlife biologist for the bison program in Yellowstone National Park and co-author on the study.

Brucellosis is a disease found in livestock and humans worldwide. Infected animals often experience a termination of pregnancy and further transmission occurs through direct contact with the fetuses and tissues.

In North America, the greater Yellowstone area is the last remaining reservoir of _Brucella abortus_. Over 20 cattle and farmed bison herds have been infected in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana since 2002, and the presence of the disease within livestock results in additional testing requirements and trade restrictions.

The study is a collaborative effort between the USGS, Northern Arizona University, University of Montana, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Idaho Department of Fish and Game, Wyoming Game and Fish Department, Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks, the National Park Service and the University of New Hampshire.

Bovine brucellosis (caused by _Brucella abortus_) has caused devastating losses to farmers in the United States over the last century. In 2002, collaborative efforts of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal, the livestock industries and state animal health authorities achieved brucellosis-free status in 48 states with no known infection. The greater Yellowstone area is the only known focus of the disease, and this formidable study reveals that elk are playing a crucial role in sustaining _Brucella abortus_ in this ecosystem.

Surveillance in elk taking advantage of samples collected by hunters has been conducted. Additional approaches in elk are warranted, now that its role appears to be more important than previously anticipated.

[Actually this type of study should have been done quite some time ago. Granted DNA studies may have prevented it, but it does shed light on the interconnected relationship of this disease and these species.

The disease may eventually evolve into a species-specific strain, but economics and politics may not allow that to happen. However, in the event that it did, it may actually be easier to control or eradicate. - Mod.TG]
