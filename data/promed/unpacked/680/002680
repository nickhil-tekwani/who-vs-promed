According to the Macedonian Press Agency (MPA, Greece) a woman was infected
by anthrax after coming in contact with anthrax powder mailed from the USA.
The only symptom that is mentioned in the MPA report is fever. The report
does not clarify the type of anthrax (cutaneous, inhalational, or
intestinal). The source of the MPA report is a Bulgarian newspaper.
More (cutaneous) anthrax cases have been reported in the Bulgarian press
(again according to MPA). However these cases were identified as cutaneous,
and they are of zoonotic origin.

[Livestock anthrax does occur in Bulgaria and human cutaneous cases arise
therefrom. We have searched high & low but so far without success for
confirmation of this Bulgarian report of a human infection following
contact with a letter from America. Until confirmed, it should be viewed
with caution. - Mod.MHJ]
