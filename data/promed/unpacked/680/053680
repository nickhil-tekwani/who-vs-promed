Rice: food for half the world.
Rice is the staple food for half the people of the world and is grown on
about 146 million hectares. It is especially important in Asia where 97
percent of the world's rice is grown. The world's annual production is 535
million tons of unmilled, rough rice, where 91 percent of the total was
produced by Asian farmers, with two countries, the People's Republic of
China(including Taiwan) and India, producing 55 percent of the total crop.
Rice is the most important food crop in Asia, where 60 percent of the
world's population is dependent on it as a staple food. Rice is the
primary source of human energy in the humid and semihumid tropics.
Asian farmers till about 89 percent of the world's harvested rice area,
accounting for 91 percent of global rice production. In Bangladesh,
Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, rice provides
56 to 80 percent of the total calories consumed.
In most of Africa and Latin America, rice is less important. On average,
rice contributes 10 percent or less of total calorie intake, although in
Guinea, Guyana, Surinam, Liberia, Madagascar, and Sierra Leone, 31 to 48
percent of the calories eaten come from rice.

Rice and poverty.
Rice production and consumption are often associated with low income and
poverty. Most of the major rice-producing countries are developing
countries categorized by the World Bank as "low income economies." In most
of the rice world, rice is not only the staple food, but also a major
economic activity and hence the source of employment and income for the
rural population. Rice is one of the cheapest sources of food energy and
protein. By 2025, more than 5 billion of the world's anticipated 10billion
people will depend on rice as their principal food. Recent projections
indicate that the world will need about 880 million tons of rice in 2025.
92 percent more rice than was consumed in 1992. In South Asia where
poverty is extensive, the food need for rice is expected to double over the
next 40 years. Production needs will be even higher, in order to provide
stocks and seeds, and for other non-food uses.

Rice trade and the international market.
In most of Asia, rice is grown on small, one-to-three-hectare farms. A
typical Asian farmer plants rice primarily to meet the family's basic
needs. In Brazil, 70 percent of the rice land cultivated is in commercial
farms of more than 50 hectares.
Less than 5 percent of the world's rice production is traded
internationally. For example, Basmati, the high-quality, scented rice
produced in Pakistan and Northwest India, commands an international market
price four times higher than the domestic price of the coarse, local rice
which low-income people eat. In1993, the major rice exporters were
Thailand (31 percent of the world market), the United States (16 percent),
Vietnam (11percent), China (9 percent), Pakistan (6 percent), and India
(5percent).
Considering that the world market for rice is thin and volatile, most
countries cannot depend on imports to meet the food needs of their people.
Self-sufficiency in rice production in order to maintain stable prices, is
an important political objective in most rice-dependent countries. For
example, if China wanted to meet just 10 percent of its domestic
consumption through imports, the demand for rice in the world market would
increase by more than 80 percent, which would dramatically affect
international prices. In addition, few developing countries have adequate
foreign exchange for major international purchases.
The climatic changes from year to year result in a variation in the price
of rice brought by farmers to market. This situation makes domestic prices
highly unstable. Price controls through maintenance of large stocks can
benefit urban consumers, but often keep farm prices below a profitable level.
Without continuing growth in productivity, it will be difficult for most
rice-dependent countries to meet the increasing demands of their people for
affordable food.

The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI).
IRRI is an autonomous, nonprofit international agricultural research center
established by the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations in 1960 to increase
food production from rice-based farming systems. Today, it is funded by
the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), an
informal association of 40 public and private sector donors that supports a
network of 16 international agricultural research centers.
IRRI shares a common goal with many organizations worldwide: To improve the
well being of present and future generations of rice farmers and consumers,
particularly those with low incomes. The Institute's objectives are to
generate and disseminate rice-related knowledge and technology of short-and
long-term environmental, social, and economic benefit and to help enhance
national rice research systems.
The Institute works through interdisciplinary research and close
collaboration with national agricultural research systems and advanced
laboratories to increase rice production efficiency and sustainability in
all rice growing environments, in an environmentally safe manner.
For more facts about rice, consult the 1997 IRRI Rice Almanac. This book
describes the origin, dissemination, and genetic diversity of rice, its
significance as human food; how and where it is grown, with profiles of
most of the world's major rice-producing countries; and IRRl's role in rice
research.
