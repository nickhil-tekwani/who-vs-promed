_Campylobacter_ bacteria cause acute gastroenteritis, typically 2-5 days after exposure to contaminated food or water. Illness is usually self-limited; however, more severe presentations can occur, as can post-infectious sequelae such as reactive arthritis and Guillain-Barre syndrome (1).

On 13 Feb 2013, Alaska State Public Health Laboratory (ASPHL) notified the Alaska Section of Epidemiology (SOE) of a cluster of 4 _C. coli_ isolates with an indistinguishable pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern that was new to Alaska. All 4 isolates were grown from stool specimens collected in late January 2013 from ill Kenai Peninsula residents.

Patient interviews and other investigative work indicated that all 4 of the ill persons with PFGE-matching _C. coli_ strains reported consuming raw (unpasteurized) milk within a few days of their illness onset. These initial interviews also led to additional case finding, primarily by way of ill persons reporting others they knew who were also ill with similar symptoms. While some of the persons who were initially identified during this investigation were reluctant to say where their raw milk came from, 4 individuals reported that it came from Farm A, a cow-share farm on the Kenai Peninsula.

A confirmed case was defined as a laboratory-confirmed, PFGE-matched, _C. coli_ infection diagnosed from 1 Jan 2013 onward. A clinical case was defined as an acute GI illness with self-reported diarrhea lasting 2 or more days in a person with exposure to Farm A raw milk within 10 days of illness onset. A secondary case was defined as an acute GI illness lasting 2 or more days in a person with close contact to a confirmed or clinical case within 10 days of illness onset.

On 14 Feb 2013, SOE notified the Office of the State Veterinarian (OSV) of the outbreak, and a joint press release and health advisory were issued on 25 Feb 2013 (2). OSV immediately notified Farm A of the outbreak and requested a list of all active shareholders. Despite notification of the outbreak, Farm A continued to distribute raw milk to shareholders living in the Kenai Peninsula and in Anchorage.

During the week of 18 Feb 2013, 2 additional confirmed cases were reported -- 1 of which was in a school-aged child who was hospitalized for 4 days with fevers, abdominal pain, rash, and acute reactive arthritis involving the wrists, ankles, knees, and hips. On 22 Feb 2013, an updated health advisory describing new developments in the outbreak was issued (3). On 22 Feb 2013, Farm A provided SOE with an incomplete shareholder list, which lacked contact information for the majority of shareholders. Calls were made to notify persons on the list about the outbreak and to identify additional cases.

In total, 31 cases were identified during the investigation (Figure [for figure, see source URL above - Mod.LL]). Ill persons ranged in age from 7 months to 72 years (median: 10 years). 3 children and an adult developed reactive arthritis lasting a minimum of 6 weeks. 2 persons were hospitalized. All ill persons were Kenai Peninsula residents who either personally consumed Farm A raw milk within 10 days of illness onset (n=29) or met the secondary case definition (n=2).

On 22 Feb 2013, OSV and SOE toured Farm A and collected cow feces, milk, and other environmental samples. Steps where the milk could be contaminated (from collection to bottling) were reviewed with the farmer, and the inherent risk of bacterial contamination of unpasteurized milk was discussed. The outbreak strain of _C. coli_ was not isolated from the samples collected at the farm that day; however, 3 different strains of _C. jejuni_ were isolated from cow manure, and Listeria monocytogenes grew from a raw milk sample.

Discussion
----------
This large outbreak of _C. coli_ infection on the Kenai Peninsula was caused by consumption of Farm A raw milk. While this outbreak appears to be over, additional campylobacteriosis cases could still be identified at any time as _Campylobacter_ species were identified from Farm A manure during the environmental investigation. Furthermore, this is the 2nd outbreak of campylobacteriosis associated with consumption of raw milk distributed by an Alaskan cow-share operation in the past 2 years (4). These outbreaks are an unfortunate reminder of the inherent risks associated with raw milk consumption, and underscore the importance of pasteurization.

It is not surprising that the _C. coli_ outbreak strain was not isolated from the environmental samples, as _Campylobacter_ bacteria are difficult to isolate from the environment, they are shed intermittently in cow manure, and the farm visit occurred weeks after the outbreak peaked. Incidentally, _L. monocytogenes_, a bacteria that can cause life-threatening meningitis, was isolated from Farm A milk; no listeriosis cases were reported during the outbreak.

Finally, 4 (13 percent) ill persons developed reactive arthritis, a painful form of inflammatory arthritis that sometimes occurs in reaction to a bacterial infection and can persist for up to 12 months. These cases underscore the fact that human campylobacteriosis can lead to prolonged adverse health consequences.

Recommendations
---------------
1. Health care providers should educate families about the risks of consuming raw dairy products. Informational materials are available at http://www.realrawmilkfacts.com/.
2. Providers should obtain stool cultures in patients with acute GI illness and history of raw dairy consumption.
3. Providers should promptly report cases of campylobacteriosis infections to SOE by calling (907) 269-8000.
4. Cow/goat-share operators should maintain current and legible shareholder/distribution records and share these records promptly with health officials if an outbreak is suspected to be linked to their farm.

[This report summarized the recent outbreak of campylobacteriosis associated with farm-share unpasteurized milk on the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska. It is unfortunate that the farm was not more forthcoming regarding those who were potentially exposed to this significant pathogen, which is by far the most common etiology of infections directly linked to the ingestion of unpasteurized milk in the USA. _Campylobacter coli_ is less frequent than _C. jejuni_ but causes similar disease.

Despite many reports of a variety of human infections directly linked to unpasteurized milk or other dairy products, the practice continues. Indeed, a number of state legislatures in 2013 have or had been pursuing legalizing (or have already done so) the practice of selling unpasteurized milk, something that has never been suggested by the FDA, CDC, or any state health department:
