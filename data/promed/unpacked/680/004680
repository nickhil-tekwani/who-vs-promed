Whirling disease hits Currant Creek; Strawberry Reservoir next?
---------------------------------------------------------------
There hasn't been a lot of news going around Utah, or the country for
that matter, about whirling disease in recent years. It seems the
disease has been accepted as a part of fishery management.

Utah hasn't been significantly impacted, largely because there is
little natural trout reproduction and planted fish are usually at
least 8 inches long.

Kokanee salmon at Flaming Gorge were discovered with the whirling
disease parasite last fall [2010] and now there is another water.
Chris Wilson, director of the Utah Division of Wildlife Resource's
(DWR) Logan Fisheries Experiment Station, confirmed evidence of the
disease has been found in trout in Currant Creek. The fact whirling is
in the popular fishery below Currant Creek Reservoir is bad, but how
it got there and where it could go may be even worse.

Currant Creek Reservoir is connected via pipeline to Strawberry
Reservoir, one of the state's most important trout and salmon
fisheries.

"Obviously, there are concerns about the cutthroat trout and kokanee
salmon in Strawberry," Wilson said. "We rely heavily on natural
reproduction at Strawberry and if the parasite gets in there the fish
would be exposed at a young and vulnerable age. At that stage the
deformities could be worse and it could be fatal."

This is not the 1st time Strawberry has been threatened by the fish
malady. Whirling disease was found in the West Fork of the Duchesne
River back in 2007. That wouldn't usually be a concern, but there is a
Central Utah Water Project Pipe on the West Fork that hauls water over
a ridge to Currant Creek. The West Fork was treated with chemicals to
kill the fish above the pipeline and a barrier was put in to prevent
fish from getting above the diversion.

Two things have happened since then. Fish tested positive for
whirling above the barrier this spring [2011] and infected fish have
been discovered in Currant Creek below the reservoir. A 22 Jun 2011
report shows that 37 of the 57 trout (browns and rainbows) collected
last fall [2010] turned up with the disease.

"It could be that it has already come down through the diversion and
into Currant Creek Reservoir and then gone down to the creek," Wilson
said. "Or it could have come from fish swimming up the Duchesne and
into Currant Creek."

If it is the latter, the invasion of the parasite to Strawberry could
be prevented for a few more years, but if it is already in the
reservoir it could also already be in Strawberry. Fish samples
collected last fall at Strawberry came back negative for whirling
disease, as have all fish tested at the reservoir.

To prepare for the eventual, and pretty much expected, arrival of
whirling disease at Strawberry, biologists have been stocking the
Hofer-Harrison strain of rainbow trout. The fish has a built-in
resistance to whirling disease.

"About half of our annual planting of 500 000 rainbows are
Hofer-Harrisons," said Strawberry Project Leader Alan Ward. "We are
making an effort to get even more of them planted in coming years."

A larger concern is the cutthroat trout in Strawberry. State
biologists have turned to the aggressive Bear Lake strain of the
Bonneville cutthroat to help control Utah chub populations in the
reservoir. It has been working, and thanks to a protective regulation
that allows the cutthroat to grow to a larger size, the chub are under
control. Also important is the fact that they are reproducing
naturally in the Strawberry system. That's important because if enough
fish are produced with natural recruitment, less fish have to be
planted from state hatcheries, allowing fish to go to other waters.

[Whirling disease affects fish in the trout and salmon (salmonid)
family. By damaging cartilage, whirling disease can kill young fish
directly, or cause infected fish to swim in an uncontrolled whirling
motion. This can make it impossible for them to escape predators or to
effectively seek food.

Whirling disease is caused by a microscopic parasite called
_Myxobolus cerebralis_. The parasite was introduced to the United
States from Europe in the 1950s and has spread to many streams across
the country. The whirling disease parasite has been found in wild fish
and fish hatcheries in 25 states.

Once established in a stream, the parasite cannot be eradicated, nor
can its worm host, without significantly damaging the ecosystem.
Whirling disease has no known human health effects. Currently there is
no known treatment for affected fish. However, practice management in
hatcheries can reduce the risk.

The disease does not affect humans, only fish in the trout and salmon
family. The infective stage of the parasite can penetrate human skin
and tissues but it does not survive at a human's natural body
temperature. Therefore the disease is harmless to humans and even if
an infected fish is consumed, it will not affect humans.

The disease can be quite devastating to fish and is a concern for all
when it is found in a body of water. Anglers can help by disinfecting
boats, boots, lines, live-wells, and other equipment prior to arrival
at a new/different body of water.
