No less than 36 new cases of people with brucellosis have been registered in the province of Tizi Ouzou in the last 48 hours. These new cases are in addition to the 31 cases recorded at the beginning of June [2018]. The same observation must be made concerning the 2 balance sheets.

Almost all cases of brucellosis recorded are concentrated in the Ouaguenoun Circle, a locality located 15 km northeast of the provincial capital. Indeed, out of the 36 cases lamented during the last 48 hours, 29 concern subjects living in this circle. As a result, firm instructions have been given to the people of this region especially, but also to the entire population of the province to avoid categorically eating cow's milk, butter or whey.

A health and population director at the provincial level said yesterday [7 Jul 2018] that brucellosis is a serious disease that can lead to the death of someone who has it, if there is no treatment in urgent medical care. The 1st symptoms of this disease are fever and night sweats. Brucellosis, added the same person in charge of the DSP of Tizi Ouzou, can be contracted by consuming un-boiled cow's milk but also by the simple fact of being in contact with a suffering animal. It is urgent that the breeders use the veterinarians of the region to check whether their cows are free of this disease, which can endanger the health, even the lives, of dozens of citizens if a lack of vigilance is found.

The 36 people with this disease have all been urgently transported to the Nedir Mohamed University Hospital Center in Tizi Ouzou. Given the seriousness of this disease and the ease and speed with which it can spread, the governor of Tizi Ouzou, Mohamed Bouderbali, has just signed an order formally prohibiting the sale of cow's milk and its derivatives. This was said by an official at the level of the provincial director of agricultural services (DSA). This measure is taken in parallel with the investigation carried out by the departments concerned to detect the origin of this disease that has lasted for more than a month.

At the beginning of last June [2018], 31 other cases of brucellosis had been reported in the same province, with a high prevalence in the Ouaguenoun region. Other communes had also been affected by this disease in June 2018, in particular: Ait Boumahdi, near Ouacifs, Draa El Mizan, Tizi Rached, Ililten, and Ait Oumalou. The services concerned had been able to identify the same origin that led the people to be affected by brucellosis.

Indeed, all reported drinking raw cow's milk. For the moment, and to the extent that some citizens are forced to consume cow's milk, for one reason or another, it would be imperative to boil it before consuming it. As for the breeders, they are called upon to protect themselves by taking care of the monitoring of their livestock by a veterinarian.

Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium of the genus _Brucella_, common to certain animals and to humans. Brucellosis is one of the notifiable occupational diseases (Mpdo) in Algeria and in many countries around the world. Anyone affected should be systematically reported to the provincial health directorate. The latter must then, in an emergency, dispatch a team on the ground to circumscribe as soon as possible, detect the disease, and discover the affected animals and their immediate surroundings.

[This infection, a bacterial zoonosis, is classified among the category B biowarfare agents. Natural transmission to humans occurs after occupational exposure or through ingestion of contaminated food products. Although brucellosis has become a rare entity in the United States and many industrialized nations because of animal vaccination programs, this condition remains a significant health problem in many developing countries.

Each species of _Brucella_ has a specific animal reservoir in which chronic disease is present. The bacilli tend to localize in the reproductive organs of the animals, causing sterility and abortions, and are shed in large numbers in the animal's urine, milk, and placental fluid. This localization allows for efficient spread to farmers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers, and consumers.

Among the 4 species known to cause disease in humans, _Brucella melitensis_ (from goats, sheep, or camels) may be the most virulent, producing the most severe and acute cases of brucellosis with disabling complications. A prolonged course of illness, which may be associated with suppurative destructive lesions, is associated with _B. suis_ (from feral or commercially raised pigs) infection. _B. abortus_ (from cattle, buffalo, and camels) is associated with mild-to-moderate sporadic disease that is rarely associated with complications.

In the Maghreb and the Middle East, human brucellosis is usually contracted through consumption of raw goat/ewe's milk or local artisanal cheese made from raw milk, and _Brucella melitensis_ is responsible for the great majority of the reported cases, with a marked predominance of its biovar 3, as in other Mediterranean countries.
