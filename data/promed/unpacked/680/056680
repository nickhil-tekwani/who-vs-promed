Health officials said on [Thu 16 Jun 2011] that 8 children have been
admitted to hospital in northern France after eating beef burgers
infected with a strain of _E. coli_, fanning fears of a wider
outbreak.

The officials said the bacterium was not related to the lethal strain
of _E. coli_ that has killed 39 people and made 3000 ill, most of them
in northern Germany. "We are now certain that this is not the same
strain as the one discovered in Germany," a health official from the
Nord-Pas-de-Calais region said on i-Tele television.

Privately owned German discount chain Lidl has withdrawn boxes of
frozen beef patties, which regional health authorities said were
behind the French infections. The boxes were sold under the brand
"Steaks Country" and had expiry dates of 10 through 12 May 2011,
officials said.

On Wed 15 Jun 2011, 5 children, aged between 20 months and 8 years
and from different towns in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region, were taken
to a hospital in the city of Lille after suffering bouts of bloody
diarrhea. One was quickly released, but 4 were still being treated at
the hospital. 3 are being treated with hemodialysis, a method of
removing waste products from the blood in the case of kidney failure.

On Thu 16 Jun 2011, 3 children were admitted to hospital, the health
official said. One of the victims' condition was life-threatening, a
medical source told Reuters.

Health Minister Xavier Bertrand said a search was under way to
determine the origin of the outbreak and stricter controls would be
enforced at production sites. "I hope we can launch a search program
very quickly, we are working on that already with French researchers
in order to identify (the origin) and deal with health problems soon,"
he said on RTL radio.

A spokesman for Lidl said that beef used in the suspect boxes had
been bought from French supplier SEB-CERF, based in the northeastern
town of Saint-Dizier, which produces some 400 tons per week of frozen
beef, according to its website. "The products were made in France, but
depending on the expiry date and our suppliers' opportunities, the
beef can come from Germany, Italy, France, the Netherlands, or even
other places," spokesman Jerome Gresland at Lidl told Reuters. "We buy
the beef through this supplier with a stamp that says it comes from
the European Union."

A box of suspected beef patties found at the home of an infected
child was labeled as containing beef that came from Germany, the
supplier's chief executive told Reuters. But, he added, that container
was not enough to determine the origin of the infection with any
certainty because many other boxes of suspected product contained beef
produced in other locations around Europe.

"There are about 10 tonnes worth of withdrawn product ... Some of it
contains beef from Belgium, Italy, there is probably even some from
France," said Guy Lamorlette, adding that he expected the result of
analyses on the beef within 48 hours. French health authorities
ordered Lidl to withdraw "Steaks Country" boxes with a range of expiry
dates after finding a box with a 10 May 2011 expiry date at the home
of one of the infected children. The firm withdrew the entire line of
frozen beef patties.

[This outbreak, linked to ground beef, is reminiscent of the
classical Jack-in-the-Box fast food restaurant outbreak in the USA
that put this group of E. coli_, mostly represented by serotype
O157:H7, "on the map." Unlike contamination of produce that is eaten
uncooked, ground beef can be adequately cooked. Together with good
kitchen hygiene, cooking will basically eliminate the hazard. The
serotype of organism is not specifically given. - Mod.LL]
