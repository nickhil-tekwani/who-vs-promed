The detection of cases of skin infections after getting tattoos is not frequent and caused concern when it began to manifest last year [2018]. As a first step, the inks that could cause the disease were removed. While studies are being carried out, the authorities assure that "it is not serious".

The director of Epidemiology of the province of Santa Fe, Julio Befani, confirmed that there are 67 people affected by an atypical mycobacterium called _Mycobacterium abscessus_. "Patients consulted different services, and laboratories tests were undergone at the Center of Medical Outpatient Specialties of Rosario (Cemar) and the Malbrán Institute," he said in statements to the program "Zysman 830" of La Ocho.

"After that, visits were made to the tattooists, and the inks that could be the cause of this pathology were removed, in that first instance we were not sure of what the origin of the infection would be," added the provincial health officer.

Befani recommended those affected to report the cases and undergo relevant studies. "The people who consented to a biopsy - some did not authorize it - have to go back to the Carrasco Hospital," warned Befani, who added that "it is not a frequent disease, it is located on the skin, and it is not a systemic infection; in fact some have shrunk spontaneously."

However, he assured that "there have not been serious cases among those analyzed so far in the first days of January [2019], during the 7 days after undergoing the tattoo" and stressed that infections "do not occur only in Santa Fe, but also in other provinces."

One of those affected described the reaction he had on his skin. "In mid-September last year [2018], I got a tattoo in a place here in Rosario and I got pimples like an allergy," said the young man, adding: "At the time they contacted me to tell me that there were several cases and that Cemar would call me to do a biopsy, if I agreed. In April this year [2019], I was called to have a biopsy and I still do not have the result," he added that "apparently the problem could be in a brand of an ink manufactured in Villa Constitución". "It [the infection] is invasive, annoying, an itch with the appearance of pimples with a lot of pus, which sprouts more when it is hot, in summer I had a lot of trouble and now with the cold it went away," said the boy, who is still waiting for the results of the studies done at Cemar.

[Rosario, with an estimated population of almost 1.3 milion in 2012 in Greater Rosario, is the largest city in the central Argentina province of Santa Fe and the third most populous city in the country, located 300 km (186 mi) northwest of Buenos Aires (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario,_Santa_Fe). A map showing the location of Rosaria can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rosario,+Santa+Fe+Province,+Argentina.

_Mycobacterium abscessus_ is a non-tunberculous mycobacterium (NTM), i.e., an acid-fast bacilli that are part of a grouping separate from the _M. tuberculosis_ complex (http://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/mycobacterium.html). NTM differ among themselves on the basis of in vitro growth rate, colonial pigmentation, and rapid molecular diagnostics. Non-pigmented, rapidly growing NTM species (RGM) include the _M. fortuitum_ complex and the _M. chelonae-abscessus_ group. RGM produce mature growth on agar plates within 7 days of incubation. More slowly growing NTM include _M. marinum_ and _M. gordonae_, _M. kansasii_ and the _M. avium/intracellulare_ complex, which includes _M. chimaera_. _M. abscessus_ was formerly classified as _M. chelonae_ subspecies _abscessus_. The _M. abscessus_ subset now includes _M. abscessus_ sensu stricto, _M. massiliense_, and _M. bolletii_.

NTM are environmental mycobacteria, found in water and soil, which can form biofilms on the inner surfaces of water distribution systems. Water from these systems can contaminate medications and medical instruments. Outbreaks of infections due to RGM are generally related to subcutaneous injection of substances contaminated with the bacterium or through invasive medical procedures employing contaminated equipment or implanted devices. Infection can also occur after accidental injury where the wound is contaminated by soil. In immunocompromised patients, RGM also cause disseminated infection.

Nontuberculous mycobacterial outbreaks associated with tattooing have been reported previously (https://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/dermatology/news/in-the-journals/%7Bd23b4f09-17bd-4c3a-ab40-67a1e69bac27%7D/tattoo-ink-causes-outbreak-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4631242/, and https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6133a3.htm). Unopened containers of tattoo ink that were contaminated during the manufacturing process or dilution of tattoo ink with non-sterile water during tattooing have been implicated in various outbreaks.

Tattoo-associated NTM infections can range from mild inflammation (e.g., rash, papules, or nodules) to severe abscesses requiring extensive and multiple surgical debridements. NTM infections can be difficult to treat and can require a minimum of 4 months of treatment with a combination of 2 or more antibiotics, usually a macrolide such as clarithromycin or azithromycin plus parenteral antibiotics such as amikacin and cefoxitin. - Mod.ML
