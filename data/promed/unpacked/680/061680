Abstract
Since 2006, more and more cases of the infectious H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV) in pet dogs have been reported in southern China. However, little is known about the prevalence situation of H3N2 CIV infections in farmed dogs in China. This is the 1st systematic epidemiological surveillance of CIV in different dog populations in Southern China.

Two virus strains -- A/Canine/Guangdong/1/2011(H3N2) and A/canine/Guangdong/5/2011(H3N2) -- were isolated from canine nasal swabs collected at one dog farm in Guangzhou and the other farm in Shenzhen. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of 8 gene segments of these viruses revealed that they were most similar to the newly isolated canine H3N2 viruses in dogs and cats from Korea and China, which originated from an avian strain. This indicates that H3N2 CIV may be a common pathogen for pet and farmed dog populations in southern China at present.

Serological surveillance has shown that the infection rates of this avian-origin canine influenza in farmed dogs and in pet dogs were 12.22 and 5.3 percent, respectively, as determined by ELISA. The data also suggested that transmission occurred, most probably by close contact, between H3N2 CIV infected dogs in different dog populations in recent years.

As H3N2 outbreaks among dogs continue in Guangdong Province (located very close to Hong Kong), [in densely populated areas with frequent animal trade], there is a continued risk for pet H3N2 CIV infections and for mutations or genetic reassortment leading to new virus strains with increased transmissibility among dogs. Further in-depth study is required, as H3N2 CIV has been established in different dog populations and poses a potential threat to public health.

[The text of the full paper concluded with the following segment: "...although no direct transmission of H3N2 CIV from dogs to humans has been reported, it is possible that the CIV may generate a new pandemic outbreak, which poses a great threat to our human life. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring dogs in pet hospitals and on dog farms; furthermore, the development of a canine H3N2 vaccine is extremely urgent."

The initial genome announcement of the H3N2 canine strain from Guangdong was published in September 2012.
