Hundreds of goats dying in NT
-----------------------------
Hundreds of feral and domestic goats have been dying from disease on
breeding blocks near Katherine in the Northern Territory. The harsh weather
conditions and the recent transport of more goats to the region are
believed to be causing the common diseases.

Vet officer Sue Fitzpatrick says the goats were having trouble urinating
and showing signs of depression. "The problems with goats hasn't changed in
the past years, it's just that we're seeing an increase in the number of
goats," she said.

"The most common problem is worms, secondly melioidosis is an ongoing
problem particularly in the Top End, iron wood toxicity and there's also
problems associated with transport of goats up to the region and with
kidding as well."

[Melioidosis, also called Whitmore's disease, is an infectious disease
caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia pseudomallei_. Melioidosis is
clinically and pathologically similar to glanders disease, but the ecology
and epidemiology of melioidosis are different from glanders. Melioidosis is
predominately a disease of tropical climates, especially in South East
Asia, where it is endemic. The bacteria causing melioidosis are found in
contaminated water and soil and are spread to humans and animals through
direct contact with the contaminated source. Glanders is contracted by
humans from infected domestic animals.

Besides humans, many animal species are susceptible to melioidosis. These
include sheep, goats, horses, swine, cattle, dogs, and cats. Transmission
occurs by direct contact with contaminated soil and surface waters. In
South East Asia, the organism has been repeatedly isolated from agriculture
fields, with infection occurring primarily during the rainy season. Humans
and animals are believed to acquire the infection by inhalation of dust,
ingestion of contaminated water, and contact with contaminated soil
especially through skin abrasions, and for military troops, by
contamination of war wounds. Person-to-person transmission can occur. There
is one report of transmission to a sister with diabetes who was the
caretaker for her brother who had chronic melioidosis. Two cases of sexual
transmission have been reported. Transmission in both cases was preceded by
a clinical history of chronic prostatitis in the source patient.

The distribution of melioidosis is predominantly tropical and subtropical
with "hyperendemicity" in the top end of the Northern Territory of
Australia and north east Thailand. The true boundaries of its endemicity
are ambiguous due to movement of the organism and its ability to travel to
and exist in temperate regions (south west Australia and France), where it
may cause sporadic disease and outbreaks. _B. pseudomallei_ has been
introduced to new environments with the export of animals, and shipments of
contaminated soil and water could potentially produce the same results.

Melioidosis has been diagnosed in sheep, goats, pigs, cattle, horses, deer,
camels, an alpaca, dogs, cats, dolphins, wallabies, a tree kangaroo, koala,
primates, birds, tropical fish, reptiles, and humans. Laboratory animals
affected by melioidosis include hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits, mice, and
rats. Host susceptibility and disease manifestations vary between species.
The introduction of naive livestock to endemic regions may predispose them
to disease, as seen with sheep, goats, pigs, and camelids. Other species
(such as dogs and cats) may succumb to infection due to immunocompromising
conditions.

Infection is thought to be opportunistic and primarily a result of
transmission from the environment rather than from animal to animal. The
most common routes of infection are via percutaneous inoculation,
contamination of wounds, ingestion of soil or contaminated carcasses, or
inhalation. Transplacental infection resulting in abortion has been
reported in goats. Sexual transmission and other means of host-to-host
transmission are possible but not documented. Laboratory-acquired infection
and iatrogenic infection via contaminated antiseptics, injections, or other
hospital or surgical equipment have been reported.

Signs can vary widely within a species, depending on the site of infection,
and range from acute to chronic. Subclinical infection is common. Infection
may be associated with single or multiple suppurative or caseous
nodules/abscesses, which can be located in any organ tissue with variable
effects. Disease most likely due to percutaneous inoculation often develops
at distant sites without evidence of active infection at the inoculation
site. The organs most commonly affected include the lungs, spleen, liver,
and associated lymph nodes. Goats often develop mastitis, and aortic
aneurysms are common findings. The respiratory system is involved
preferentially in sheep. CNS disease has been seen in cattle, horses,
sheep, and goats. Pigs often have asymptomatic lesions on the spleen that
are incidental findings at slaughter. Lameness due to septic arthritis and
osteomyelitis can occur. Fatalities often occur in association with acute
fulminating infections or when vital organs are affected.

None of this, however, explains the observed signs of "...having trouble
urinating and showing signs of depression." Dehydration from shipping may
cause depression, as can fever or a number of diseases. The article does
not tell us if these animals were vaccinated or against which diseases.

Mastitis in goats is a common manifestation, and _B. pseudomallei_ has been
isolated from milk, resulting in the requirement for pasteurization of
commercial goats' milk in the tropics. Infected animal carcasses are
condemned at the abattoir.
