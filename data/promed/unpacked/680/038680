An Oconee County woman is under a physician's care after being exposed to rabies in the Seneca area by a cat that tested positive for the disease, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control announced Friday [3 Jan 2014].

Health officials recommend that people avoid wild animals acting tame and tame animals acting wild to reduce their risk of being exposed to the disease.

Officials said state law requires pet owners to have their pets regularly vaccinated against the disease. They said this is the 5th cat from South Carolina with rabies this year [2013], and 2 dogs in the state have also been exposed.

Officials said there were 137 confirmed cases of animal rabies during 2012 in South Carolina and 123 confirmed cases in animals statewide in 2013. This animal was the 3rd to test positive in 2013 from Oconee County.

Environmental Health officials announced Tuesday [31 Dec 2013] that on Christmas Eve [24 Dec 2013] a stray cat bit and scratched 2 persons who live in the 5700 block of Old Federal Road South, Chatsworth.

One of the persons bitten took the cat to Murray County Animal Control where Jason Osgatharp, environmental health county manager, made the determination to have the cat tested because it exhibited abnormal behavior.

The cat was submitted to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory and positive test results for rabies were received Tuesday [31 Dec 2013].

According to the persons bitten, the cat would show up at their home about once a month.

The rabid cat was black with a white chin, weighed about 10 pounds [4.5 kg], and appeared otherwise healthy. Those living in or near the 5700 block of Old Federal Road South should report any bites or scratches from stray cats which occurred within the past month, especially if the stray fits this description. Call the Murray County Environmental Health Office. The persons who were bitten will start post-rabies exposure treatment today [31 Dec 2013] or tomorrow [1 Jan 2014].

Five other cats at the residence, all of which are unvaccinated, will be euthanized.

Rabies is deadly. Report all bites and have them treated appropriately at a medical facility. While post exposure prophylaxis is possible in people, there is a only a short amount of time from the bite until the treatment must be administered to be effective. Sadly, people still die from this disease, in the USA. Neither of the 2 reports above mentions anything about a rabies drive in the community, or more public service announcements (PSA's) to recommend vaccination of all companion animals. Yes, companion animals include horses and show animals as well. - Mod.TG]
