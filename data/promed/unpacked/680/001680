Outbreak of _E. coli_ infections
--------------------------------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are investigating a multistate outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _ E. coli_ (STEC) O157:H7, also called enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) infections. This investigation includes illnesses recently reported by the Maryland Department of Health and Wisconsin Department of Health Services.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _E. coli_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people were closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.

As of 18 Nov 2019, a total of 17 people infected with the outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 have been reported from 8 states.

Arizona / 1
California / 2
Colorado / 1

Maryland / 2

Total 17

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 24 Sep 2019 to 8 Nov 2019. Ill people range in age from 3 to 72 years, with a median age of 16. 56 percent of ill people are female. Of 17 ill people with information available, 7 hospitalizations have been reported, including 2 people who developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type of kidney failure. No deaths have been reported.

The Maryland Department of Health identified _E. coli_ O157 in an unopened package of Ready Pac Foods Bistro (R) Chicken Caesar Salad collected from a sick person's home in Maryland. The salad had a "Best By" date of 31 Oct 2019. WGS is currently underway in Maryland for this sample to determine if it is closely related genetically to the _E. coli_ found in people in this outbreak.

State and local public health officials are interviewing ill people to determine what they ate and other exposures in the week before their illness started. Ill people in Maryland reported eating Ready Pac Foods Bistro (R) Chicken Caesar Salad. In initial interviews, ill people in other states have not reported eating this particular salad.

FDA is tracing back the supply of the romaine lettuce in the salad and has identified possible farms in Salinas, California. Preliminary information indicates that romaine lettuce used in the product that tested positive was harvested in mid-October 2019 and is no longer within current expiration dates.

The investigation is ongoing to determine the source of contamination and if additional products are linked to illness. CDC will provide more information as it becomes available.

[ProMED has recently posted regarding clusters of O157 infections in both Wisconsin and Maryland. Not all the cases in those states are noted here and this may well be because they occurred after 8 Nov 2019 or that some of the cases are unrelated. It is clear, however, that some of the Wisconsin cases and some of the Maryland cases are related. ProMED awaits more information regarding the scope, distribution, and vehicle for transmission of this outbreak. - Mod.LL
