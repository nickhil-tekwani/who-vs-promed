USDA Won't Allow Independent Mad Cow Disease Tests
------------------------------------------------
The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) will not allow American
beef companies to independently test their cattle for mad cow
disease, an agency official said on Fri 9 Apr 2004.

The USDA said it rejected a request by Creekstone Farms
Premium Beef to allow 100 percent testing for the brain-wasting
disease, a step the privately owned company deemed necessary
to resume trade with Japan.

"The use of the test as proposed by Creekstone would have
implied a consumer safety aspect that is not scientifically
warranted," said USDA Undersecretary Bill Hawks in a statement.
"The test is now licensed for animal health surveillance purposes."

Creekstone offered to pay for its own testing to appease Japan,
which shut its borders to U.S. beef after the discovery of the 1st
and only U.S. case of mad cow disease in Dec 2004.

Company officials were not immediately available for comment.

Japan usually accounts for 40 percent of U.S. beef exports, buying
more than USD 1 billion a year in beef, veal and variety meats. As
a step to restoring trade, Japan wants the United States to test all
slaughtered cattle for mad cow disease.

The USDA repeated its stance that such testing was not
scientifically justified. U.S. Vice President Richard Cheney was
expected to raise the issue when he visits Japan next week. "We
are continuing our discussions with all of our trading partners so
that trade can resume based on international scientific standards,"
Hawks said.
