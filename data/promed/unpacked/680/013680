Central African Republic: Hepatitis E Outbreak in Capital
--------------------------------------------------
Health officials in the Central African Republic have reported an outbreak
of hepatitis E virus infection in 3 neighbourhoods of the capital city,
Bangui, state-owned Radio Centrafrique reported on Thu 17 Jun 2004. It
stated that a joint team of the Ministry of Health and Medecins sans
Frontieres detected cases of the disease in the neigbourhoods of Gobongo,
Kokoro-Boeing and Nguito.
"The cases of hepatitis E are few, our team detected about 10 cases," Dr
Abel Namssenmo, the director of preventive medicine and fight against
disease at the Ministry of Health and Population, told IRIN on Fri 18 Jun
2004. He added that the joint medical team was monitoring the outbreak. In
a communique read over the radio, the ministry urged the public to use only
safe drinking water and to disinfect wells. In Bangui, hawkers sell water
in plastic sachets; a practice that health authorities have warned is unsafe.
Symptoms of the disease are yellowish eyes, tiredness and stomachaches. The
World Health Organization (WHO) says hepatitis E is a waterborne disease
transmitted from person to person via the fecal-oral route. Contaminated
water or food supplies have been implicated in major outbreaks, it stated.
People who have never contracted hepatitis are at risk of infection, WHO
stated, and the disease finds fertile ground in areas of poor sanitation.
Hepatitis E virus infection is a mild to moderate disease in severity with
a mortality rate of 0.4-4.0 percent, WHO stated, "except in pregnancy,
where the mortality rate is progressively higher in each succeeding
trimester and may reach 20 percent".

[Hepatitis E virus (HEV), previously considered to be a calicivirus-like
agent, is now ranked as a separate unassigned virus genus. Although similar
in structure and genome organisation to caliciviruses, HEV exhibits weak
phylogenetic links with rubella virus, alphaviruses, and plant furoviruses.
In humans, HEV is associated with outbreaks and sporadic cases of
enterically transmitted acute hepatitis. It has an incubation period of 2-7
weeks and appears to be spread mainly in water. Large water-borne epidemics
have occurred in India, and morbidity and mortality are greatest in
pregnant women. HEV is considered to be endemic in tropical and
sub-tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Central America. However,
antibody prevalence suggests that the virus is distributed more widely in
less pathogenic forms.
An outbreak of hepatitis E virus infection occurred in Bangui in July 2002
(see reference below), and as in the present outbreak was thought to be
associated with fecal contamination of drinking water. It is unclear
whether the outbreak described above is due to poor sanitation or is
indicative of the appearance of a strain of enhanced virulence. A virus
closely related to some human isolates of HEV has been isolated from swine.
Swine HEV in addition to its close genomic resemblance to human HEV can be
transmitted to non-human primates experimentally, and may play a role in
the epidemiology of hepatitis E. - Mod.CP]
