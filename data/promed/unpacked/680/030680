Scientists warned that aggressive strains of potato blight
[_Phytophthora infestans_ could trigger a potentially catastrophic
potato famine in Russia. [This is the same blight that was involved in
the Irish potato famine. - Mod.JW
Researchers want an international effort to provide Russian
potato-growers with fungicides and seed varieties that are resistant
to virulent late blight [strains, which last year destroyed more than
15% of the country's total crop.
Kandukuri Raman, a plant scientist at Cornell University in Ithaca,
New York, and head of the Cornell-Eastern Europe-Mexico (CEEM) project
on control of potato late blight, was quoted as saying, "The situation
is worrying, and it could quickly worsen."
[Because of the state of the country's economy Raman fears that
Russia will not be able to control the disease without outside
support. He points out that Russia has no strong potato-breeding
programme aimed at developing varieties resistant to late blight.
Spores of _P. infestans_ constantly reproduce and take on
characteristics that enable them to survive and spread.

[Scientists working on the CEEM project say that late blight of potato
(caused by _Phytophthora infestans_) is the greatest single problem
for potato producers worldwide. The center of origin of the pathogen
is thought to be the Toluca Valley in Mexico. New strains of the
fungus evolve continually, thus frustrating efforts leading to
development of resistant cultivars and, consequently, maintaining the
dependency on chemical fungicides for disease management. A
comprehensive collection of late blight websites is available at the
CEEM web site:
<http://www.cals.cornell.edu/dept/plantbreed/CEEM/>
Scientists from CEEM and the Mlochow Research Center in Poland are
leading an effort to save the valuable potato collection at the N.I.
Vavilov All-Russian Research Institute of Plant Industry in Pushkin
and St. Petersburg, Russia. The Vavilov collection of potatoes in
Russia is considered one of the world's greatest potato gene
resources. The collection contains more than 190 Russian cultivars,
about 2600 accessions (types) of potatoes grown in the Andes Mountains
(Andigena) and about 2500 types of potatoes derived from 70 wild
species that may be resistant to late blight, blackleg, wart, and
other potato pathogens. The collection also contains many hybrids of
wild potato species. For further information, go to the following web
