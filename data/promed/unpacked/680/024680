Thousands of dead starfish found on beach
-----------------------------------------
Thousands of starfish have been found washed up dead on a beach in Kent. A
carpet of the dead creatures covered hundreds of yards of the beach at
Pegwell Bay near Sandwich. Tony Flashman, from Kingsdown near Deal, who
took a photograph [visible on the website] said: "The dead starfish
stretched as far as you could see in both directions."

Fishermen and bird watchers were among the 1st to stumble on the bizarre
sight, and it was quickly picked up by specialist websites. The Environment
Agency is investigating the incident but said it was not connected with the
recent storms, pollution or climate change.

Spokesman Ian Humphries said it was not uncommon for starfish to be washed
up on the shore and it was likely they had entered shallow waters in search
of mussels to feed on. "As they get hungry they get more desperate... they
take risks and come into shallow water where they're more vulnerable." he said.

There was speculation on some of the websites that the starfish, which
congregate in vast numbers, may have fallen victim to trawlers dredging the
sea bottom. The Environment Agency said it was likely the starfish corpses
would provide a feast for scavenging gulls.

[The photograph is an incredible showing of a huge number of starfish for
quite a distance. It is interesting that no one is testing the water or the
starfish to find out if there is a disease or toxin killing the starfish.
These may be sentinels to early environmental changes. I wonder if it is
because the knowledge of starfish is not as robust as for other animals? -
