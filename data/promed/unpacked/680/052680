The 73-year-old man with rabies encephalitis succumbed to the illness
after an 8 week ICU stay. After the diagnosis was confirmed on 1 Mar
2007 by nuchal biopsy DFA, he was treated with the Wisconsin
protocol. He had slow development of a neutralizing antibody response
in blood and CSF. After withdrawal of all sedation, he continued to
meet clinical criteria for brain death, although cerebral perfusion
was maintained by nuclear imaging. Supportive care was continued as
the reported unvaccinated survivor had a similar clinical picture for
a time after development of an antibody response. However, after
progressive worsening of his neuro-imaging and a complete lack of
neurologic recovery over weeks, care was withdrawn, and he died on 26
Apr 2007. Many dedicated clinicians and laboratorians contributed to
this man's care.
Postmortem results on the pathology of the progressive neurologic
inflammation are pending. This man had received rabies vaccination
after he had established encephalitic disease, presented with
advanced disease, and was of older age. It is unclear, but these
factors may have further altered his neurologic course adversely.
Success of the Wisconsin protocol is yet to be replicated.
The bat bite occurred in August 2006, and the patient developed
prodromal symptoms (pain at the bite site) in January 2007. Variant
typing of the virus responsible for this infection has been
completed, and it is typical of those known to circulate in silver
haired bats in the US and Canada (this information via personal
communication, Dr. Susan Nadin-Davis, Canadian Food Inspection
Agency). This variant has been implicated in a significant number of
indigenously-acquired human rabies cases in the US in recent years
and was the strain responsible for the Quebec case in 2000.
