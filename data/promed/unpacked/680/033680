By Monday, public health investigators expect to be trapping mice in search
of clues as to how a 25-year-old LaVista man may have been exposed to [Sin
Nombre virus]. The patient, who remained in critical condition [on a
ventilator] Friday at Clarkson Hospital, is believed to have hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome [HPS}. It is the first case of HPS in the [Omaha]
metropolitan area.
Three places where [the patient] has spent most of his time have been
checked and no evidence of rodent activity was found, public health
officials said.
Kramer [Wayne Kramer?] said he expects three or four sites to emerge as
priority locations for trapping rodents. "We will probably do some trapping
outside the metro area," he said. Blood from trapped mice will be sent to
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for testing. It
could take at least a week or two
before results would be known, he said.

Dr. Elizabeth Lien, an infectious disease specialist, said a laboratory
test done by specialists in New Mexico was positive for [Sin Nombre virus],
but the course of his illness does not totally fit the typical pattern of
the disease, she said.
No other cases [illnesses caused by hantaviruses] have been reported in
Nebraska this year.
