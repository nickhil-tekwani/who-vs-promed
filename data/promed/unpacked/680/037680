Ebola threatens Africa's lowland gorillas
------------------------------------------
Ebola fever, which has killed 114 of the 128 people who have caught
it in the latest outbreak, threatens one of the last strongholds of the
endangered lowland gorilla, the Zoological Society of London said
yesterday.

The disease is estimated to have killed between 600 and 800
western lowland gorillas, almost 2/3 of the population in the Lossi
sanctuary, south of Odzala national park in the Congo Republic. It
has also killed an unknown number of chimpanzees -- see:

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature says
thousands of great apes might have died in recent years. The
disease was confirmed in north-west Congo in December [2002]
when 6 gorillas from a family that had been followed by researchers
for 6 years were found dead.

There remains a danger that the virus, which has been in Congo
and Gabon sporadically for 5 or 6 years, will infect the Odzala
population of 20 000 gorillas. It could cross again into neighbouring
Gabon, another hotspot for gorillas and chimpanzees, said Jonathan
Baillie, manager of a Zoological Society of London project in Gabon.
There are estimated to be about 80 000 western lowland gorillas in
Gabon and the Congo. They represent 80 percent of the world's
gorilla population.

Mr Baillie, a Canadian-born zoologist, said: "Ebola now combines
with hunting for bushmeat and logging as a risk to the great apes."

Ebola is passed on by contact with infected bodily fluids and is
believed to be spread through the consumption of the flesh of
primates, whether monkeys, chimpanzees, or gorillas, shot as
bushmeat.

Gabon recently declared 10 per cent of the country as national park
in an attempt to make eco-tourism a substitute for declining oil
revenues. Logging is fast becoming another one.

The Zoological Society of London is involved with a conservation
project that is already paying for itself out of tourist revenue and is
working to get gorillas used to the presence of visitors, a 5-year
process. Mr Baillie said: "The idea is that when local people see that
tourists have flown across the world to get there they may think there
is something in the rainforest worth protecting."
