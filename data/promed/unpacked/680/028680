Human:
During week 40, 12 new West Nile virus (WNV) clinical cases [Ontario
(11), and Prince Edward Island (1) / travel related] were reported in
Canada. As of 8 Oct 2005, 221 WNV clinical cases and 12 asymptomatic
infections have been reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada
(PHAC). Of the 221 clinical cases, 48 (22 percent) were reported as
West Nile Neurological Syndrome, 162 (73 percent) were reported as
West Nile Non-Neurological Syndrome, and 11 (5 percent) were
Unclassified/Unspecified. To date, there have been 11 deaths
[Saskatchewan (2), Manitoba (1), Ontario (7) and Quebec (1)] reported
in patients with WNV infection.
Bird:
During week 40, 8 dead birds were tested, and one (12 percent) was
reported positive for WNV (see bird table). A total of 3943 dead
birds have been tested since 2 May 2005, of which 447 (11 percent)
were positive for WNV. Of the 447 positive birds, 331 (74 percent)
were identified as American Crows and 115 (26 percent) were Blue Jays.
Domestic Animal:
As of week 40, 20 horses positive for WNV were reported in Ontario
(4), Manitoba (4), Saskatchewan (10) and Alberta (2).
Mosquito:
As of week 40, 695 mosquito pools positive for WNV were reported in
Alberta (1), Saskatchewan (110), Manitoba (193), Ontario (291) and
Quebec (100). National West Nile virus surveillance data and maps can
be found on the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) web site at:

* Cases with neurologic manifestations (such as WN meningitis, WN
encephalitis, WN myelitis)

*** Illnesses for which insufficient clinical information was provided
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET
by state and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly
West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the
list of nationally notifiable diseases, and therefore it is optional
whether or not state health departments report these cases to CDC
[further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and
West Nile fever are available at the URL above].
"Other Clinical" includes persons with clinical manifestations other
than WN fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute
flaccid paralysis. Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient
clinical information was not provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC - These numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases occurring between 1 Jan 2005 through
12 Oct 2005 that have been reported to ArboNet by state and local
health departments. ArboNet is the national, electronic surveillance
system established by CDC to assist states in tracking West Nile
virus and other mosquito-borne viruses. Information regarding 2005
virus/disease activity is posted when such cases are reported to CDC.
Of the 2148 cases, 858 (40 percent) were reported as West Nile
meningitis or encephalitis (neuroinvasive disease), 1151 (54 percent)
were reported as West Nile fever (milder disease), and 139 (6
percent) were clinically unspecified at this time. Please refer to
state health department web sites for further details regarding state
case totals.
Note: The high proportion of neuroinvasive disease cases among
reported cases of West Nile virus disease reflects surveillance
reporting bias. Serious cases are more likely to be reported than
mild cases. Also, the surveillance system is not designed to detect
asymptomatic infections. Data from population-based surveys indicate
that among all people who become infected with West Nile virus
(including people with asymptomatic infections), less than one
percent will develop severe neuroinvasive disease. See: Mostashari F,
Bunning ML, Kitsutani PT, et al. Epidemic West Nile Encephalitis, New
York, 1999: Results of a household-based seroepidemiological survey.
