Five additional people have contracted Legionnaires' disease in Hamilton and another person has died, following a cluster of cases first detected a year ago in the Mercer County town (https://www.nj.com/mercer/2020/09/health-department-investigating-cluster-of-legionnaires-disease-in-nj-that-has-left-2-dead.html).

The total number of cases stretching back to August 2020 is now 9, with 3 deaths, and they remain under investigation by the state Department of Health, the town and state reported Tuesday [21 Sep 2021] in a joint statement.

Hamilton first reported 4 cases of Legionnaires last August [2020], 2 of which were fatal (https://www.nj.com/mercer/2020/09/health-department-investigating-cluster-of-legionnaires-disease-in-nj-that-has-left-2-dead.html). Since then, officials said Wednesday [22 Sep 2021], they identified 5 more cases, one from November 2020 and 4 from May to August 2021. One person died last month [August 2021], described only as an elderly township resident.

"The water is safe to drink, but there are basic precautions that residents can take to help protect themselves -- such as regularly flushing water at their taps and maintaining their hot water tank," state epidemiologist Dr. Tina Tan said in a statement issued by Hamilton. [People can also get Legionnaires' disease by aspiration of drinking water containing _Legionella_ (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/about/causes-transmission.html). - Mod.ML]

Tan noted that home air conditioning units do not use water as a cooling agent and do not aerosolize water, thus are not a risk for growing _Legionella_, the bacteria that cause the disease, which is spread through the inhalation of infected water droplets (https://www.nj.gov/health/cd/topics/legion.shtml).

Legionnaires' disease is a pneumonia that is treatable with antibiotics, and health officials stressed that anyone with symptoms seek medical attention. The main symptoms -- cough, shortness of breath, fever, muscle aches, and headaches -- are similar to those of COVID-19. And while many people exposed to _Legionella_ do not get sick, people who are 50 years or older, especially those who smoke cigarettes, or with other medical conditions or weakened immune systems, are at greater risk for the disease.

Hamilton gets a portion of its drinking water (https://hamiltonnj.com/water) from Trenton Water Works (TWW; https://www.trentonnj.org/154/Water-Sewer), the city-based public utility that also provides water to parts of Lawrence, Ewing and Hopewell Valley towns. Hamilton is also served by Aqua, a private water company (https://www.aquaamerica.com/our-states/new-jersey.aspx). But officials said the Legionnaires' [disease] issue appears to be based in Hamilton.

"While water samples collected at [Trenton Water Works' treatment plant and central pumping station] have consistently shown no presence of _Legionella_, water samples collected from homes and businesses in Hamilton Township served by TWW, have identified the presence of _Legionella_," the statement says. "There is concern that _Legionella_ may be present in other buildings and homes in the area," the statement says. No other towns served by Trenton Water Works have publicly reported Legionnaires' [disease] cases.

Mark A. Lavenberg, Trenton's water and sewer director, said in the statement: "We continue to work with our partners at the New Jersey Department of Health and Hamilton Township to empower residents in Hamilton and in our service area on how to protect themselves and their families from Legionnaires' disease." Lavenberg said Trenton Water Works is launching a public awareness campaign on 1 Oct 2021 to educate their customers about Legionnaires' [disease], which he characterized as a "critical public health issue."

Officials say Hamilton homeowners and businesses are urged to consider precautions to protect themselves from Legionnaires' [disease], a list which can be found here (https://www.hamiltonnj.com/news/?FeedID=3806) and said healthcare providers treating Hamilton residents should maintain a higher "high index of suspicion" for Legionnaires' disease when evaluating symptoms.

"I want to thank [state health officials] for their involvement in studying the frustrating frequency of Legionnaires' disease cases in Hamilton over the past decade and working with TWW and our Division of Health to keep the residents of Hamilton safe," Hamilton Mayor Jeff Martin said. "Clean and safe drinking water is a human right -- one that we will continue to fight to make sure all residents can comfortably know they have access to."

[ProMED thanks Dr. Mahmoud Orabi for this submission.

The above news article reports a cluster of 9 cases of Legionnaires' disease, with 3 deaths, in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, since August 2020. A cluster refers to multiple cases in space and time that are possibly linked. An outbreak of Legionnaires' disease would imply that a common source is suspected (https://legionnaires.ecdc.europa.eu/?pid=205). Genotyping the clinical isolates will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. The news report above fails to say if genotyping of any clinical isolates has been done.

The news report above says that water samples collected from homes and businesses in Hamilton Township served by Trenton Water Works have identified the presence of _Legionella_, but water samples from Trenton Water Works' (TWW) treatment plant and central pumping station have consistently not shown the presence of _Legionella_, suggesting contamination is occurring closer to the homes and businesses. We are not told the species or genotypes of strains isolated from the water samples. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. More information, if available, would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Humans acquire Legionnaires' disease by inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. Possible person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease has also been described (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds.

Possible sources include aerosols generated from a _Legionella_-contaminated plumbing system by showerheads, sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, and hot tubs/spas. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C [77-104 F] in plumbing systems support the highest concentrations of the organism.

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/).

_Legionella pneumophila_, the usual _Legionella_ species causing legionellosis in the USA, has been shown to persist for long periods in the biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems is usually done by culture, which would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Hamilton Township, with a total population of 88 464 residents in 2010, is a residential community, located immediately east of the city of Trenton, the US state of New Jersey's capital and county seat, in Mercer County (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Township,_Mercer_County,_New_Jersey).
