CHRONIC DISEASE OF INFECTIOUS ETIOLOGY
********************************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html>
[Prof. Hal Nash became interested in the possible links between
infection & chronic disease, partly through reading ProMED-mail.
We commissioned him to provide a summary of the current state of
knowledge, which will be posted in several parts, all with titles
beginning:
"Chronic disease"

Chronic Diseases With Possible Infectious Etiologies
---------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
---------------
In 1979, curved bacterial cells (vibrios) were isolated from stomach
biopsies from patients with gastric ulcers. Researchers J. Robin
Warren and Barry J. Marshall succeeded in inoculating themselves with
_Helicobacter pylori_ and consequently developed transient gastritis.
They then hypothesized that many if not most cases of gastric ulcers
were the result of an infectious etiology rather than of organic
etiology. Such an hypothesis rocked the medical as well as the
microbiological communities. The method of "doing science" put
Warren and Marshall's hypothesis to the test. In the ensuing two
decades, their hypothesis has been supported.
This discovery was a landmark case for the search for infectious
etiologies for chronic diseases, although such an idea has existed
for many years. Such a search has been waiting for particular
developments in molecular biology. From the late 70s to the present,
dramatic advances in the study, isolation, and function of molecular
entities have occurred. In the space of less than a generation, the
tools necessary to engineer molecules, splice, excise, and change
those molecules have become commonplace. This is the moment that the
search for infectious etiologies has been waiting for. An excellent
article by David A. Relman, "Detection and Identification of
Previously Unrecognized Microbial Pathogens," contains an excellent,
general treatise of the subject of molecular biology and its
application to microbial identification. The article can be found at
http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol4no3/relman.htm.
Chronic diseases are by definition, as well as by nature, much more
subtle than acute diseases. The obvious is not present. Rather, the
subtleties require the exquisite abilities of molecular biology to
detect incredibly small evidences of microbial activity, or the
remnants of such activity. Prior to this generation, the tools for
such detection simply did not exist or were not available to a large
extent. Borrowing from the language of nuclear physics, we have
reached a critical mass for the study of chronic diseases with
suspected infectious etiologies.
What follows are brief synopses of several chronic diseases whose
causes are suspected to be microbial in origin. It would be foolish
to assume that this is an exhaustive compilation. Rather, I have
started with recent postings on ProMED-mail and other sources for
information on emerging diseases. I wish to thank everyone who
responded to my requests for information on the various diseases
addressed here. I believe it is noteworthy that everyone to whom I
wrote responded with useful information. And in light of that, it is
unmistakeable evidence of the service provided by SatelLife and
ProMED-mail.
