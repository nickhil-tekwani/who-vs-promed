Viral Meningitis Claims First Life
----------------------------------
AUCKLAND: The current outbreak of viral meningitis in New Zealand has
claimed its first life. Ministry of Health public health advisor, Douglas
Lush, stated that a newborn baby had died, but he would not say where the
infant lived. So far this year 47 cases of viral meningitis, [attributed
to Echovirus type 33 infection, have been reported in Northland, Auckland,
Waikato, Wellington and the Hutt Valley. Doctor Lush emphasized that viral
meningitis is totally different from meningicoccal [bacterial meningitis,
which has been common in South Auckland. He stated that the viral form
[known as aseptic menningitis can be just as dangerous, especially for
young babies, and it can also cause miscarriages. The increasing number of
cases is causing concern and people should see a doctor if they develop the
symptoms of meningitis, which include fever, headaches, rashes, vomiting
and diarrhea.

[Echovirus type 33 has not been associated with aseptic meningitis in New
Zealand previously. It is one of many viruses associated with aseptic
meningitis and the extent of this outbreak may reflect a general lack of
immunity to this virus in the population. -Mod.CP
