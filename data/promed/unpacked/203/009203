Public Health England (PHE) can confirm that a 2nd individual has been diagnosed with monkeypox in England.

There is no UK link to the patient diagnosed last week in Cornwall who is currently receiving care at the Royal Free in London. This 2nd patient had travelled to Nigeria where they are believed to have acquired the infection. The 2nd case 1st presented at Blackpool Victoria Hospital and following a positive test result was transferred to Royal Liverpool University Hospital, an expert respiratory infectious disease centre, where they are receiving appropriate care.

Dr Nick Phin, Deputy Director, National Infection Service at PHE:

We know that in September 2017, Nigeria experienced a large sustained outbreak of monkeypox, and, since then, sporadic cases have continued to be reported. It is likely that monkeypox continues to circulate in Nigeria and could, therefore, affect travellers who are returning from this part of the world.

However, it is very unusual to see 2 cases in such a relatively short space of time. We are working hard to contact individuals, including healthcare workers, that might have come into contact with the individual to provide information and health advice.

Dr Mike Beadsworth, Clinical Director of the Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit, said, "We are treating a patient who has tested positive for monkeypox. The patient is being cared for on our specialist infectious and tropical diseases unit by highly trained staff who are experienced in dealing with a variety of infectious diseases. All necessary precautions are being taken by specialist staff, and there is currently no risk to other staff, patients or visitors. We ask that people continue to use our services as normal and that people only come to our emergency department if their condition is serious and/or an emergency."

A 2nd case of monkeypox has been identified in the UK, just days after the 1st was discovered.

The patient tested positive at Blackpool Victoria Hospital and had recently travelled to Nigeria where they are believed to have contracted it, Public Health England said. They have been transferred to Liverpool University Hospital for treatment.

The 1st UK case was diagnosed in Cornwall, in a patient who had also spent time in Nigeria.

The rare viral infection does not spread easily between humans, and most people recover within a few weeks.

PHE said there was no UK link between the [2] patients.

What is monkeypox?
- Monkeypox is usually a mild self-limiting illness, and most people recover within a few weeks; however, severe illness can occur in some.
- It is a rare disease caused by monkeypox virus, and has been reported mainly in central and west African countries.
- It can spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person; however, there is a very low risk of transmission to the general population.
- Initial symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.
- A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. [Source: Public Health England]

[It is interesting that the UK had its 1st ever monkeypox case diagnosed 3 days ago and now has a 2nd case. No indication is given about where in Nigeria these 2 cases might have acquired their infections. There are several possibilities. Nigeria has had many monkeypox cases in 2017-2018 in several states. The most recent cases were in June 2018 in Plateau state. These cases in Nigeria were caused by the West African clade of the monkeypox virus, presumably the same clade of the virus as infects the 2 UK cases.

Non-human primates are not a monkeypox virus reservoir. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent, and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_).
