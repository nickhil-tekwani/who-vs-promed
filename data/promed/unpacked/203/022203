The State Department of Health warned residents on Wednesday [6 Mar 2019] about a new confirmed case of measles in Ocean County, [New Jersey]. Health officials said the resident could have possibly exposed others to the highly contagious disease late last month [February 2019] in Lakewood at 2 Orthodox synagogues. [See URL for details of locations of possible exposure. - Mod.LK]

Between October 2018 and January 2019, state and local health officials dealt with an outbreak of measles, with 30 confirmed cases in Ocean County residents. There were also 3 cases in one Passaic County household, directly tied to the "outbreak community," state officials said.

That outbreak was considered over on 16 Jan [2019], after 2 incubation periods (a total of 42 days) had passed from the last day the last known case was infectious, health officials said.

In a follow-up on the measles outbreak in Brooklyn and Queens, city health officials report a dozen new cases, bringing the total to 133 since October [2019]. Most of these cases have involved members of the Orthodox Jewish community. The neighborhood of Williamsburg has seen 11 new cases in the past week, while one travel-related case was reported in Brighton Beach.

The majority of individuals diagnosed with measles have been children, more than 90% of whom were unvaccinated. Several patients acquired measles while traveling abroad to the UK, Israel, and Ukraine. To date, over 5700 exposures have occurred in the city related to this outbreak, primarily in healthcare facilities, including in emergency departments, inpatient facilities, urgent care centers, and numerous outpatient clinic settings.

Health officials say there are large outbreaks of measles occurring globally, including in Israel, Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa. Providers should ensure that adults and children aged greater than 12 months who are traveling outside the USA have documented immunity to measles.

https://www.foxnews.com/health/two-people-contract-measles-after-passenger-exposes-travelers-to-virus-on-international-flight-to-california-officials-say


At least 2 people on an international flight to California contracted measles after a passenger with the virus exposed them to it, officials said this week [week of Mon 4 Mar 2019]. A Santa Cruz County resident exposed several people to measles last month [February 2019] after boarding an international flight while sick with the virus, the San Francisco Department of Public Health reported this week.

Rachael Kagan, a department spokeswoman, told the Sacramento Bee that the flight departed from somewhere in Asia. According to the report, 2 other passengers became sick after the flight landed in San Francisco.

Officials said they believe the risk to the public is very low; no one else reported contracting measles from the flight, which was more than 3 weeks ago. The illness usually develops within 21 days of the initial exposure. "Making sure you have all your immunizations is especially important for travelers, because measles is circulating in many countries outside the USA," the health department said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] said that the majority of measles cases occur when an unvaccinated person travels to a country where the virus is especially common and brings it back into the USA. In 2018, 82 people brought measles to the USA from other countries, the greatest number of imported cases since the measles was virtually eliminated from the USA in 2000, CDC reported. There have been 6 reported outbreaks this year [in the USA] with a total of 206 cases as of [28 Feb 2019].

[The 2 other people who "became sick after the flight landed in San Francisco" would not have contracted measles from the infected individual on the flight, as that is too short an incubation period. Perhaps what was meant was some days after the flight landed in San Francisco. Or perhaps these are 2 people who became sick, in addition to the individual on the flight who infected 2 more people, after being infected in the country to which they traveled. A full course of the MMR vaccine will protect individuals from contracting measles, mumps, and rubella in countries where the virus is endemic, or on flights, or wherever an infectious person is present. - Mod.LK]

Another case of measles has been confirmed in the Metro Vancouver area, but it's not clear where it happened. The region's 17th case is connected to the current outbreak in Vancouver, which is linked to 3 francophone schools within the city, Fraser Health said on Wednesday [6 Mar 2019].

The health authority said a measles patient was immediately isolated on Wednesday [6 Mar 2019] before becoming contagious, and said the public was not exposed any further. Officials would not confirm the identity of the patient, nor where the case was located.

The new case came after Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) confirmed 2 others on 27 Feb 2019; they, too, were linked to the French-language schools. Both of those patients received follow-up care and had come into contact with people who had contracted the virus.

The number of measles cases continues to rise in Ukraine, albeit at a slightly lower level in the past 2 weeks, according to the Center for Public Health of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine. During the 9th week of 2019, 2524 people -- 1230 adults and 1312 children -- became ill with measles. An additional fatality was reported in a 25 day old infant, the 10th measles death of the year [2019].

Through 1 Mar [2019], Ukraine health officials reported 26 544 cases. The highest rates of morbidity are in Lviv, Vinnytsia, Rivne, Khmelnytsky, and Kyiv. Poor immunization coverage has contributed to the measles outbreak in Ukraine. In 2018, the measles vaccination rate for newborn babies was only 54%, which is among the lowest in the world.

In order to stop the spread of measles, a special operation is under way in the Lviv region to increase the level of immunization of children. In January and February [2019], tens of thousands of schoolchildren have been vaccinated. Other regions of Ukraine will also be covered. Similar events are already taking place in Vinnytsia region, health officials note.

This week [week of Mon 4 Mar 2019], a total of 81 cases of measles have been reported (laboratory confirmed or with an epidemiological link). A total of 45 cases of measles have been reported from Skopje (of whom 73.3% were incompletely vaccinated, unvaccinated, or with unknown vaccine status) while the other 36 are from 9 other cities in Macedonia.

From Gevgelija, 7 cases were reported, 6 of them unvaccinated. From Kumanovo, 8 cases were reported, 7 unvaccinated. From Tetovo, 7 new cases were reported, 6 of which were not vaccinated, with incomplete vaccine status. From Struga, 5 cases were reported, of which 3 were incompletely vaccinated with unknown vaccine status. Three new cases have been reported from [each of] Debar and Veles; [of these,] 5 persons have been incomplete vaccinated or with unknown vaccine status. Also, one new case from [each of] Kriva Palanka (not vaccinated), Kicevo (unknown vaccine status), and Kocani (completely vaccinated) [were reported].

A total of 493 cases of measles have been registered in Macedonia since the beginning of the epidemic in Skopje since December 2018, of which 410 have been linked to the epidemic in Skopje.

According to the place of permanent living, measles cases were registered in 17 towns in Macedonia, of which 366 cases were from Skopje, 39 from Tetovo, 25 from Kumanovo, 16 from Gevgelija, 9 from Debar, 7 from Struga, 6 from Gostivar, 6 from Veles, 5 from Kichevo, and 4 from Kocani, and the other 7 cities are sporadic cases.

The largest number of cases are from the age group 0-4 years: 220, or 44.6% of the total. A high percentage of patients is also registered in elderly groups. Persons older than 30 years account for 36.9% (n = 182) and persons from 20-29 years for 10.3% (n = 51).

Out of a total of 122 cases of children aged 1-4 years, 105 (86%) were unvaccinated, and out of 233 cases in people over 20 years of age, 70.8% (n = 165) were unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or had unknown vaccine status.

From the total number of registered 493 cases of measles, the highest number and percentage -- 278 (56.4%) -- are laboratory confirmed; 117 (23.7%) are epidemiologically related, while 98 cases (19.9%) are measles [presumably this means clinically diagnosed but not laboratory confirmed. - Mod.SH].

Since the onset of the epidemic, in Skopje, total of 9958 children under 14 years of age have been vaccinated as part of the response to the outbreak with a 1st or 2nd dose. In the rest of the republic, since the epidemic began, a total of 5193 children up to 14 years have been vaccinated with a 1st or 2nd dose. The total number of those aged 14 years [and under] who have received MRP vaccine since the start of the epidemic in the Republic of Macedonia is 15 151.

The numbers are down compared with those of the same period last year [2018], but not enough to boast about: measles has affected 288 people in France in the 1st 2 months of 2019, announced Public Health France on Wednesday [6 Mar 2019], stating that "90% of cases occurred in subjects not or poorly vaccinated". Last year [2018], 745 cases were recorded between 1 Jan and 3 Mar 2018.

In its weekly bulletin, the agency said that 81 of the 288 infected patients had to be hospitalized, including 4 in intensive care. The most important focus of the disease is in the Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes region, in Val Thorens ski resort, with 50 cases (36 suspected and 14 confirmed), mostly seasonal workers. Reunion, meanwhile, recorded 33 cases since the beginning of the year [2019], "with resumption of indigenous transmission following imported cases" of neighboring islands (Madagascar, Comoros, Mayotte, and Mauritius), according to Public Health France.

In 2018, France had recorded 2800 cases of measles, including 3 deaths. Decreasing in 2012 and 2016, the disease has been on the increase since the end of 2017, following a drop in vaccination coverage.

A 2nd case of measles infection was reported in Armenia on Wednesday [6 Mar 2019], the country's Ministry of Health press office reported. A person infected with this disease arrived on 20 Feb [2019] in Armenia through the territory of Georgia. Clinical symptoms became visible on 25 and 26 Feb [2019], which was initially explained as drug intolerance, but later, on 6 Mar [2019], a laboratory test diagnosed measles disease.

According to the Ministry of Health, the 1st measles infection was reportedly found in Armenia by a Ukrainian citizen who arrived in Yerevan by plane from Kiev on 24 Feb [2019].

The 2 infected people had contact with many people, particularly those in the airport lobby and at the hospital.

The Department of Health-Centre for Health Development (DoH-CHD) in Bicol has raised the red flag on the region as 10 deaths from measles and dengue were reported in the 1st quarter of the year [2019].

Ernie Vera, DoH-Bicol regional director, said measles and dengue cases were rising as parents remain hesitant to have their children vaccinated after the Dengvaxia controversy. He said that poor coverage of vaccination across the region, specifically in the province of Albay, was a cause for alarm.

The DoH-CHD, through the Philippine Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response, has recorded 493 measles cases in the region as of 4 Mar [2019]. Of this number, 148 cases were in Albay, 122 in Camarines Sur, 106 in Sorsogon, 86 in Masbate, 23 in Camarines Norte, and 7 in Catanduanes.

At least 6 afflicted children have died: 3 in Masbate and one each in Albay, Camarines Sur, and Sorsogon.

The health official said that, while the increasing trend could not yet be considered as an outbreak, they had classified Bicol under those in the red flag situation, meaning an alarming condition.

The Canterbury District Health Board is buying in fresh supplies of the measles vaccine as the outbreak continues to grow. The number of measles cases in Canterbury isn't expected to slow anytime soon. There are now 20 confirmed cases in the region.

The DHB says 18 000 doses of the vaccine are due to arrive this week [week of Mon 11 Mar 2019], and it'll be ordering more. It's reminding people that measles is highly infectious, and anyone who's not immunised and comes within 2 m [6.6 ft] of someone who's infectious stands a 90% chance of getting it.

One in 10 people who get measles will need hospital treatment, and up to 30% will develop complications.

A measles outbreak on the South Island of New Zealand is causing serious concern, with 22 confirmed cases and emergency supplies of vaccine being rushed from around the country. Amid the worst outbreak "in years", health officials have warned cases will spread in the coming days and weeks, as around a fifth of people living in the affected Canterbury region have not had their full suite of vaccinations, or any at all. "It can now be assumed that measles is circulating widely in our community," the Canterbury District Health Board said in a statement.

Parents say they are living in fear of their children contracting the illness, as New Zealand's 3rd-largest city, Christchurch, and surrounding regions run out of vaccines.

Measles cases are rising globally, including in wealthy nations such as the USA and Germany, where some parents shun the vaccines mostly for philosophical or religious reasons, or concerns, debunked by medical science, that the vaccines against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) could cause autism.

A number of measles outbreaks have occurred in New Zealand in the last few years, but the current Canterbury outbreak is significant and spreading quickly. Health experts are concerned that the Canterbury outbreak is the tip of the iceberg in New Zealand, and further outbreaks in different parts of the country are expected as the year [2019] progresses.

The 1st case of measles was recorded in Canterbury in February [2019]. An extra 3000 doses of the vaccine are slated to arrive in the region on Sunday [10 Mar 2019], followed by a further 18 000 mid-week. In total, 100 000 are expected to arrive in the coming weeks.

New Zealand's ministry of health said in a statement that, since 2012, all cases of measles in New Zealand came from travellers bringing the disease from overseas.

https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/severe-measles-outbreak-threatens-thousands-south-sudan


More than 75 000 measles vaccines have been airlifted to South Sudan's Gogrial West County in response to an outbreak declared by the State Ministry of Health. There are 98 suspected measles cases, with one death reported. Medair, an international humanitarian organisation, has mobilized an emergency response team to vaccinate children under 5 years of age in an area where the population is estimated at over 400 000 people. The campaign is expected to be conducted from 7-17 Mar 2019.

Responding to this measles outbreak is made even more urgent by high levels of global acute malnutrition (GAM) among children in Gogrial West County. "This is an area where the population is incredibly vulnerable," said Jennifer Turner, health manager with Medair's emergency response team. "Children who are malnourished are more at risk of being infected with measles, and the complications are often more severe. The food insecurity in this region is rated at a "crisis" level."

To reach so many children with vaccinations over a short period of time, Medair will train and deploy more than 800 people from the affected communities who will work steadily for 10 days. Teams of 8 will head out each day carrying a supply of vaccines, which must be kept cold despite daytime temperatures of 40 deg C [104 deg F]. During shipping, storage, and distribution, the ice packs will be frozen using generator power and, where available, solar-powered vaccine fridges. All vaccines and supplies must be transported by air from Juba.

Medair South Sudan's emergency response team is always available to respond to healthcare emergencies. In 2018, the team completed 23 emergency interventions in health, nutrition, water, and sanitation, and the distribution of critical items.

[13] Madagascar

[F] is aged 2 but weighs no more than a 4 month old, the terrible result of her battle with measles, which is cutting a deadly swathe through Madagascar. Widespread malnutrition and low rates of immunisation on the Indian Ocean island have ramped up the killing power of the highly infectious virus. In the last 6 months, nearly 1000 children have been killed by a resurgent disease that vaccination once appeared to have tamed.

Between last September [2018] and February [2019], there were more than 79 000 cases of measles in Madagascar, 926 of which were fatal, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The Anivorano-nord clinic has had 510 patients suffering from "kitrotro" and "kisaosy", the local names for measles. Roughly 100 patients were hospitalised, but only 4 lost their lives, according to official statistics. In Madagascar, where 47% of children under 5 are malnourished, the disease has proved particularly dangerous. "It's often said that malnutrition makes a bed for measles," said Vincent Sodjinou, a WHO representative. "The most serious cases are often reported in malnourished children."

The paediatric ward at Antsiranana's military hospital, north of Anivorano, has been overwhelmed. "Normally we only treat one measles case here every 2 months," said head of medicine Ravohavy Setriny Mahatsangy. "We've had 444 just since December [2018]. The people prefer traditional healers who often advise them to refuse any hospitalisation," said Dr Said Borohany, a health ministry official. "And most villages are hours away from basic medical centres."

The other viable solution, vaccinations, has been complicated by the lack of funds available for such a programme. Until now the nation's vaccination programme has administered only a single dose, when WHO recommends 2. The UN agency estimates that 5.6 million doses would be needed to contain the epidemic. But Madagascar is USD 1.6 million (EUR 1.42 million) short of the USD 11.2 million [EUR 9.96 million] needed to fund such an operation.

Newly elected president, Andry Rajoelina, has promised to vaccinate all children aged between 6 months and 9 years.

Vancouver's measles outbreak -- like most Canadian measles outbreaks -- was started by a traveller bringing the virus from overseas. With just 17 confirmed cases as of Friday [8 Mar 2019], this outbreak is relatively small. Other countries aren't so lucky.

According to WHO, around 110 000 people worldwide died from the vaccine-preventable disease in 2017. WHO also named vaccine hesitancy one of the top 10 global health threats in 2019. The Public Health Agency of Canada recommends making sure your vaccinations are up-to-date before travel. Here are some of the places currently facing measles outbreaks around the world, though many more countries are reporting cases too.

- Madagascar. Almost 1000 people have died from measles since October [2018]. Most of them were children. Madagascar is one of the world's poorest countries. Parents there are desperate to vaccinate their children, many trudging for miles to get to clinics for shots. But there are not enough vaccines, the health ministry says, and many people are too poor to afford them. Measles is endemic on the island, but the last vaccination drive was in 2004. Nearly 2/3 of children have not been vaccinated, according to WHO, and coverage needs to be around 95% to prevent the virus from spreading in communities. The vaccine also needs to be kept cold, and much of the island does not have electricity.

- Philippines. One case of measles in Vancouver involved a traveller returning from the Philippines. According to a report this week from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, measles cases in 2018 were up 547% from the year before [2017]. Just this year [2019], 261 people, mostly children, have died. That's more than in all of 2018, the report notes. According to an article in the Journal of Global Health, many people in the Philippines don't trust vaccines after a vaccine scandal in 2014 involving the dengue fever vaccine Dengvaxia. Some people with no history of dengue were at higher risk of developing a more severe form of the disease if they caught it after being vaccinated. Although that vaccine is no longer sold in the Philippines, many parents there are now reluctant to vaccinate their children against other diseases.

- Ukraine. In 2018, there were 30 338 more measles cases in Ukraine than in 2017, according to a recent report by UNICEF. In the first 2 months of 2019, another 24 042 people were infected, said the report. Thirty people have died from the disease since 2017. UNICEF blames low vaccination rates in the country due to negative attitudes toward vaccination in some regions as well as previous shortages in vaccine supply. Some other eastern European countries, notably Serbia and Romania, have also seen big increases in the number of measles cases in recent years. In Romania, 59 people have died from measles since 2016, according to UNICEF.

- Venezuela and Brazil. Venezuela's ongoing political crisis has affected the health of its population, including weakening immunization programs, according to an upcoming report in the April 2019 edition of the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. The latest reports from the Venezuela Ministry of Health estimate that only about half of the population has received 2 doses of the measles vaccine. According to the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), there were 283 measles cases reported in January and February 2019, with 40 confirmed cases. In 2018, 74 Venezuelans died from measles. The resurgence of infectious diseases in Venezuela is a public health threat to the region, according to the Emerging Infectious Diseases report. Brazil also frequently sees measles outbreaks: 10 000 cases over roughly the last year have resulted in 12 deaths, according to PAHO. Many, though not all, cases come from Venezuelans.

- Italy and France. Italy currently has more measles cases than anywhere else in western Europe -- 165 cases in January [2019] -- according to a recent report from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Italy's current co-ruling Five Star Movement has questioned the safety of some vaccines and rejected calls to make them mandatory. France had 124 measles cases in January [2019]. It also had the most cases in the European Union in 2018 at 2913. Thirty-five people died from measles in EU/EEA countries in 2018.

- Japan. Japan recorded about 170 measles cases in the first 2 months of 2019, according to media reports. This is the highest over that period in 10 years. A report in the New York Times said that many of the cases were among people connected to Kyusei Shinkyo, a group that promotes alternative healing. The group has since posted a statement on its website apologizing for the outbreak.

Abstract
Background: The hypothesized link between the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism continues to cause concern and challenge vaccine uptake.
Objective: To evaluate whether the MMR vaccine increases the risk for autism in children, subgroups of children, or time periods after vaccination.
Participants: 657 461 children born in Denmark from 1999 through 31 Dec 2010, with follow-up from one year of age and through 31 Aug 2013.
Results: During 5 025 754 person-years of follow-up, 6517 children were diagnosed with autism (incidence 129.7 per 100 000 person-years). Comparing MMR-vaccinated with MMR-unvaccinated children yielded a fully adjusted autism hazard ratio of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.02). Similarly, no increased risk for autism after MMR vaccination was consistently observed in subgroups of children defined according to sibling history of autism, autism risk factors (based on a disease risk score) or other childhood vaccinations, or during specified time periods after vaccination.

[One can only hope that this latest analysis in a string of very large and well-conceived cohort studies will put to rest the concern that the MMR vaccine is associated with autism. Both the study itself and the editorial are highly recommended reading. - Mod.LK
