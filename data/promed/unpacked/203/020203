The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have published their Community
Zoonoses Report for 2007, which analyses the occurrence of infectious
diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans. The report
shows that although figures varied considerably between Member
States, _Campylobacter_ infections still topped the list of zoonotic
diseases in the European Union and that the number of cases due to
_Salmonella_ infections in humans fell for the 4th year in a row.
Cases of listeriosis remained at the same level.

In 2007, infections from _Campylobacter_ were again the most
frequently reported zoonotic disease in humans across the European
Union, with 200 507 cases compared to 175 561 in the previous year,
an increase of 14.2 percent. Regarding _Salmonella_, although the
number of cases showed a decrease for a 4th successive year, 151 995
people were affected by the bacterium in 2007 compared to 164 011 in
2006. The number of _Listeria_ infections in humans in 2007 remained
at the same level as in 2006, with 1554 confirmed cases; _Listeria_
also showed the highest mortality rate, especially among vulnerable groups.

"The 2007 Zoonoses Report shows that many bacteria are still being
transmitted from animals to our food. It is good to see that
_Salmonella_ is on the decline, likely due to the control measures
taken along the food chain. _Campylobacter_ and _Listeria_ in food
are still of concern and need to be addressed," EFSA's Director of
Scientific Cooperation, Hubert Deluyker said.

ECDC's Head of Surveillance, Andrea Ammon, added: "Although tackling
_Salmonella_ and _Campylobacter_ infections remains a top priority,
we are particularly concerned by the high proportion of deaths
amongst older people as a result of infection with _Listeria_. We
have also noted a high proportion of new born babies among the cases
of listeriosis. ECDC is working closely with EFSA in a joint effort
to find out more about the transmission of _Listeria_ infections and
what prevention measures can be taken to reduce the number of cases
and deaths."

In foodstuffs, _Campylobacter_, which generally causes diarrhoea,
cramps and fever in humans, was mostly found in raw poultry meat,
with an average of 26 percent of samples showing contamination. In
live animals, _Campylobacter_ was found in poultry, pigs and cattle.

Poultry and pig meat were reported as the foods most frequently
associated with _Salmonella_, and on average 5.5 percent of all fresh
poultry meat samples within the European Union was found to be
contaminated (_Campylobacter_ and _Salmonella_ are more recurrent
than the infections they cause, as they are easily killed by
conventional cooking measures). Eggs and egg products were also found
to be contaminated, while the bacterium was only rarely detected in
raw dairy products, vegetables and fruits. In animal populations,
_Salmonella_ was most frequently detected in poultry flocks. In 2007,
the Commission launched a new control programme against _Salmonella_
in breeding poultry flocks, and at the end of that year, 15 Member
States had already met the legal target of one percent, which is set
for the end of 2009. (In accordance with Regulation (EC) No
2160/2003, these control programmes aim at reaching the _Salmonella_
reduction target set by Regulation (EC) No 1003/2005 and cover the
following serovars: _S._ Enteritidis, _S._ Typhimurium, _S._
Infantis, _S._ Virchow and _S._ Hadar).

_Listeria_, although less frequent in humans compared to
_Campylobacter_ and _Salmonella_, showed a high mortality rate of 20
percent, particularly amongst vulnerable groups such as the elderly.
Listeriosis is also very dangerous to pregnant women, as it can cause
fetal infections, miscarriages and stillbirths. Results showed some
cases of _Listeria_ above the legal safety limit in ready-to-eat
foods, most often in smoked fish and other fishery products, followed
by meat products and cheese.

The importance of a zoonosis as a human infection does not depend
only on its incidence in the population, but also on its severity, as
some may cause serious illnesses or have higher mortality rates
despite relatively low numbers of cases. This is the case, for
instance, of verotoxigenic _Escherichia coli_ (VTEC), which accounted
for a total of 2905 human infections in the European Union. Among
animals and foodstuffs, VTEC was most often reported in cattle and
bovine meat and very rarely in vegetables. Also, the number of
yersiniosis cases in humans in 2007 was 8792, with the bacterium
being found mostly in pigs and pig meat. The 2 parasitic zoonoses
trichinellosis and echinococcosis were reported in 779 and 834 human
infections respectively within the European Union. The report also
provided data on other zoonotic diseases, such as brucellosis, bovine
tuberculosis and rabies.
