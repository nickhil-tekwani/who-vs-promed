1st report of _Xylella fastidiosa_ in Italy
-------------------------------------------
EPPO was alerted about the possible presence of _Xylella fastidiosa_ (EPPO A1 List) on olive trees (_Olea europaea_) in southern Italy. Shortly after, the NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of Italy provided information about the involvement of _X. fastidiosa_ in the [olive] disease that is currently observed.

An extensive leaf scorch and dieback of olive trees is spreading rapidly in the Puglia region. To identify the possible causal agent, surveys were carried out. Symptomatic olive trees (many of them were a century old) revealed the presence of extensive brown discolouration of the vascular system. Fungal species of genus _Phaeoacremonium_ and genus _Phaeomoniella_ were found.

Samples from olive trees were subjected to molecular analysis specific for _X. fastidiosa_ which gave positive results. The analysis was extended to almond (_Prunus dulcis_) and oleander (_Nerium oleander_) plants which were growing in the vicinity of affected olive trees and showing symptoms of leaf scorch. The results were also positive. Further serological tests confirmed the presence of _X. fastidiosa_.

The NPPO stressed that the definitive identification of the bacterium still awaits its isolation in pure culture in order to perform pathogenicity tests. In addition, further investigations are on-going to identify the bacterial strain, to evaluate its pathogenicity and identify the putative local insect vector(s).

Surveys are being carried out in Puglia to delimit the extent of the infected area. It is prohibited to move propagation material of any susceptible host species from the infected area. For the control of the [olive] disease, which does not seem to be exclusively due to _X. fastidiosa_, the adoption of further phytosanitary measures is currently being evaluated.

[_Xylella fastidiosa_ (Xf) clogs the xylem in infected plants causing wilting, necrosis, and often death of the host. It has been reported from a number of crop hosts causing very serious diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine, leaf scorch of almond, phony disease of peach, leaf scald of plum, variegated chlorosis of citrus, lucerne dwarf, as well as leaf scorch of coffee, elm, oak, plane, mulberry, maple, oleander, and other woody ornamentals. In olive, it causes branch dieback and leaf scorch. Latent infections of a number of wild species have also been reported, and these can serve as pathogen reservoirs. While all strains of _Xylella_ have been classified into a single species, there are different pathotypes, most of which have not been characterised and compared with each other yet. The pathotype affecting oleander and almond, but not grapevine, has been reported to also affect olives. Several subspecies have been proposed.

_X. fastidiosa_ is spread by xylem-feeding insect vectors including several species of sharpshooters (including _Carneocephala_, _Draeculacephala_, _Graphocephala_, and _Homalodisca_ species). It can also be spread by grafting and with infected plant material, but is not seedborne. Moist conditions favour the vectors and therefore Xf associated diseases. Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of potential reservoir hosts and vector insects and may include use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as vector control.

The pathogen has been reported mainly from the Americas, but was recently confirmed for the 1st time in Asia, on grapevine in Taiwan (ProMED-mail post 20130806.1866205). It has also been suspected in other locations in Asia, and its occurrence in Oceania is currently unknown. Both the bacterium and its main vectors are of serious quarantine concern in Europe, Africa, and Australasia. If Xf can be conclusively confirmed in Italy by the ongoing infectivity tests mentioned above, it appears likely that this would be the 1st report of the pathogen in Europe.
