Not to play "The Professor of the Bleeding Obvious," but could the increase in STDs be related to a possible/probable increase in sex workers plying their trade to the workers at the North Dakota oil-production sites?

[ProMED-mail thanks Celeste Whitlow for her comment. She is, of course, absolutely correct.

North Dakota has been undergoing an oil boom since 2006 from the Bakken Shale formation, which occupies about 200 000 square miles (520 000 square km) of the subsurface rock in the Williston Basin (http://www.thebakkenshale.com), underlying parts of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Although oil was 1st discovered within the Bakken in 1950s, only with hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as fracking, a process of injecting fluid deep into underground rock formations to force the oil out, and horizontal drilling technologies, did oil production soar. Most new Bakken drilling and production has been in North Dakota, and in 2012, North Dakota produced more than 10 percent of all US crude oil production and was the 2nd largest oil-producing state in the US, behind only Texas in volume of oil produced (http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_crd_crpdn_adc_mbbl_a.htm). For a map of the Bakken Formation, see http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703795004575087623756596514.

As a result, oil-field workers have flooded the oil-producing western part of North Dakota (http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703795004575087623756596514). The number of actively-drilling rigs in North Dakota were said to be about 200 in 2011. With each rig estimated to require 120 full-time workers, a total of about 25 000 jobs were created, plus an extra 10 000 jobs for workers who lay pipes to producing wells and produce processing plants (http://www.npr.org/2011/12/02/142695152/oil-boom-puts-strain-on-north-dakota-towns).

With thousands of workers, drawn from across the country to North Dakota, the population of some counties has almost doubled (http://www.npr.org/2011/12/02/142695152/oil-boom-puts-strain-on-north-dakota-towns). The oil boom has brought with it increases in organized drug trafficking, gun crimes, sexual assault and prostitution rings, "exacerbated by a housing shortage that is spurring the construction of sprawling 'man camps' that can accommodate hundreds of out-of-state oil workers" (http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/04/23/as-bakken-oil-booms-police-prepare-for-change/ and http://www.npr.org/2014/02/01/265698046/booming-oil-fields-may-be-giving-sex-trafficking-a-boost). A photo of a "man camp" is available at http://www.mintpressnews.com/prostitution-rises-in-the-new-wild-west-north-dakotas-oil-country/176240/. Prostitution and strip clubs have appeared around these "man camps" (http://www.npr.org/2014/02/01/265698046/booming-oil-fields-may-be-giving-sex-trafficking-a-boost). However, it is estimated that a large proportion of women in the sex trade were "trafficked" at a very young age and are victims themselves (http://www.mintpressnews.com/prostitution-rises-in-the-new-wild-west-north-dakotas-oil-country/176240/).

Law enforcement agencies are said to be having problems filling posts, where applicants would rather take jobs in the oil industry that pay 2 to 3 times as much (http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/04/23/as-bakken-oil-booms-police-prepare-for-change/). The surging population is also taxing the previously rural region's healthcare system, where personnel shortages are similarly occurring due to high housing prices and high competitive wages in the oil industry (https://www.stanford.edu/group/ruralwest/cgi-bin/drupal/content/bakken-boom-fractures-north-dakota-health-care and http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/07/pf/America_boomtown_healthcare/). - Mod.ML
