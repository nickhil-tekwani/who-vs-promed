Health officials in Malaysia are investigating a malaria cluster in Kuala Lipis, Pahang state. On [Thu 11 Jul 2019], 4 confirmed cases of malaria were reported to Kuala Lipis District Health Office (PKD) from Betau Health Clinic. All cases involve Orang Asli children aged 4-10 from 2 villages, 2 cases [each] from Kampung Pagar and Kampung Serdang. All cases have been taken to the Kuala Lipis Hospital ward and given treatment.

Kuala Lipis has not reported a malaria case for the past 8 years; the last case was reported in 2011.

The Pahang State Health Department has activated the epidemic room on [12 Jul 2019] and control activities and case detection (active case detection) conducted by Kuala Lipis PKD Team in Kampung Pagar and Kampung Serdang. A total of 393 blood slides have been taken from residents in both villages for microscopic testing. [Based on] initial examination of the slides, PKD found 11 more malaria infections in Kampung Serdang.

From [11-15 Jul 2019], there have been 15 cases reported from these 2 villages. All cases have been diagnosed with _Plasmodium vivax_, hospitalized for treatment and are in a stable condition.

PKD has also carried out malaria control activities by conducting indoor residual spraying and distribution of mosquito nets in the affected locality. At this point, the PKD team is in the process of tracking cases and vector control activities.

Residents in the locality have been given health education to take preventive measures by wearing clothing that covers the limbs and using repellents to prevent mosquito bites. In addition, residents are advised to sleep in the mosquito nets and avoid activities that take place in or near the forest area at night.

The Ministry of Health is monitoring the occurrence of this malaria case cluster, and the collaboration of the public is very much needed to ensure that the incidence of malaria can be controlled.

[Along with China and the Republic of Korea, Malaysia is one of the 3 countries of the WHO Western Pacific Region, and it's also among 21 countries in total across the globe identified by WHO in 2016 as having the potential to eliminate malaria by 2020. The selection was based on an analysis that looked at the likelihood of elimination across key criteria. Reaching malaria-free status is a critically important public health and sustainable development goal. It is also a core objective of the WHO Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030, which calls for the elimination of malaria in at least 10 countries by the year 2020.

It is also worth noting that the dominant local human malaria species in Malaysia is _Plasmodium vivax_ (69%) with 33 areas (foci) with active malaria transmission; the populations at greater risk are labourers, including foreign workers, in agriculture, farming, and forestry sectors in East Malaysia. There are 8666 people at risk of malaria in these areas.

As "an important aspect of the disease in the country is the presence of _P. knowlesi_ malaria, a parasite normally found in monkeys, and now accounting for the majority of local cases", the 3 main activities to keep Malaysia on the course of malaria elimination by 2020 are as follows:
- increase surveillance of _P. knowlesi_ zoonotic infections and strengthen elimination efforts;
- intensify surveillance activities to address the threat of malaria importation and better target foreign and migrant workers engaged in activities such as agriculture, forestry, and mining; and
- continue to invest in its national malaria strategy to ensure the financing of programmes targeting elimination and prevention of reintroduction.

The resurgence of _P. vivax_ among this specific group of people (aged 4-10 years old) is worrisome, and further investigation will elucidate the specific contextual situation to support the national effort to eliminate malaria by 2020. - Mod.ST]

[_Plasmodium vivax_ are seen in 2 isoforms, one with a long incubation time of up to 8 months (White NJ. The rise and fall of long-latency _Plasmodium vivax_. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 2019 Apr 1; 113(4): 163-168. doi: 10.1093/trstmh/trz002. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30809676).

Outbreaks like this one is common in areas where there is a transmission potential due to the presence of anopheles mosquitoes, and a limited local transmission is started from an introduced case, usually an asymptomatic carrier from an endemic area. It is important to know which isoform is found in this outbreak to understand the transmission dynamics and when it was introduced. Thus, genotyping should be performed. - Mod.EP
