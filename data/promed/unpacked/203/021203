Mumbai is reeling from many cases of waterborne diseases like
jaundice, diarrhea, and gastroenteritis; now cholera has also been
added to that list. Two children have tested positive at the Sion
hospital on Fri 1 Jul 2011.

"The samples of the 2 children have shown the presence of the cholera
organism. One is from Antop Hill and the other from Bhiwandi. They are
presently being treated, and both are recuperating," confirmed a
senior doctor from the Sion hospital. Their reports have been sent to
Kasturba hospital. The patients were hospitalized with complaints of
vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. Doctors treating them said
that they exhibited classic symptoms of cholera, like sunken eyes,
stomach ache, and severe dehydration.

Five people, including 2 foreigners, were admitted in Ropar Civil
Hospital on Saturday [2 Jul 2011] in what is turning out to be a
diarrhea outbreak in the city. In all, 46 cases of diarrhea have been
reported from the city in the past week.

A research scholar on the Indian economy from Argentina and an
American man were on the way to Manali from Chandigarh when they
stopped to have food at a dhaba in Ropar on Friday night, 1 Jul 2011.
Soon after dinner, they started feeling nauseous, followed by
vomiting. When their condition did not improve even after a visit to a
local RMP doctor, they were brought to the civil hospital. The
American was being kept in an emergency ward suffering from
dehydration following diarrhea.

Two residents of Ropar were also admitted to the emergency ward on
Sat 2 Jul 2011. According to reports, over 46 patients were found
affected by diarrhea and other gastrointestinal ailments during the
last 7 days. The outbreak has reportedly been triggered by poor
quality water supplied to the residents. A local resident, said:
"People here are deprived of fresh drinking water despite being
located on the banks of the Satluj river."

Ropar district health officer Dr Balbir Singh said: "We have already
instructed MC authorities in Ropar to take preventive measures and
have also set up 2 committees under deputy commissioner and civil
surgeon, Ropar to combat the epidemic." However, there were no reports
of any awareness campaign or preventive measures like providing
chlorine tablets or ORS solution to residents in affected areas,
sources said.

Six people have died of cholera, while 56 have been hospitalized with
diarrhea in the tribal hamlets of Kerala's hilly Wayanad district, a
legislator said on Wed 29 Jun 2011.

Intervening in the debate, state Health Minister Adoor Prakash said:
"We have started supplying clean drinking water to these hamlets. And
where vehicles cannot reach, we are supplying water in bottles. A
medical team has already started conducting check-ups," said Prakash.

Chief minister Oommen Chandy said that everything that needs to be
done for the welfare of people will be done. "Out of the 83 houses in
the affected hamlets, only 31 homes have latrines. During the rainy
season, the wells get contaminated. We have issued orders to the
district authorities to see that latrines are built in all the homes,"
said Chandy.

Four people died, while 8 others were hospitalised in Kano and Takai
(65 km north of Kano metropolis) due to the outbreak of
gastroenteritis at the weekend. Meanwhile, health authorities in the
state have embarked on sanitization of open wells and other sources of
drinking water in the area. The officials who went round the town and
other surrounding hamlets offered curative attention to the victims to
forestall the spread of the disease.

The primary healthcare coordinator of the council, Malam Mansur
Abdulkadir, told reporters that the outbreak of the disease did not,
however, reach a "crisis stage", adding that the situation was under
control.

Mr Jacob Wongdem, the permanent secretary in the Plateau State
Ministry of Health, has announced the outbreak of cholera in some
parts of the state. Wongdem, who earlier denied the outbreak of the
disease, said in Jos on Thu 30 Jun 2011 that it had killed 10 people.

He added that 370 people had also been infected by the disease,
reported in Jos South, Jos North, Mangu, Shendam, Barkin Ladi and
Pankshin local government areas.

"It is a bad situation, but the ministry is already doing everything
to control and stem the ailment," the permanent secretary said. He
attributed the outbreak to poor sanitary conditions and the
consumption of contaminated fruits and unwashed vegetables.

Four new cases of cholera were reported in Kinshasa on Mon 27 Jun
2011. This figure given by WHO brings the number of cholera cases to 7
in the Congolese capital. The outskirts are the most affected by the
disease.

The Public Health Ministry recommends the population to observe
strict individual and collective hygiene measures.

The director of the fight against the disease at the Ministry of
Health, Dr Benoit Kebela Ilunga, advised people to wash their hands
carefully after coming back from the bathroom, before eating, and
before preparing food. He also forbids them to drink water sold in
plastic bags. He explained that in some areas of Kinshasa where there
is no public restroom, people defecate in plastic bags that they throw
into the street. Dr Benoit Kebela condemns this practice. He asks
people who live in neighborhoods without access to water provided by
Regideso to boil water before drinking.
