Bovine TB found in Colorado
-------------------------------
A Colorado rodeo bull has undergone a necropsy to determine whether
it carried bovine tuberculosis (TB) as part of an investigation that
has so far found 2 animals testing positive for the disease. Tests
are expected to be completed next week [20-24 Aug 2007].
Infected cattle must be found in 2 or more separate herds before the
USDA can yank a state's TB Accredited Free State status, said Terry
Fankhauser, executive vice president of the Colorado Cattlemen's
Association.
Colorado Agriculture Department spokeswoman Christi Lightcap said the
bull now being tested was found in a separate herd from others that
tested positive.
The state's cattle industry could lose its tuberculosis-free
accreditation if the bull now being tested has the disease. The
animal has been in at least a dozen states. "Other states are keeping
a close eye on this," said Lightcap. The accreditation is necessary
to allow cattle producers to ship livestock freely without costly
testing.
"What it amounts to is, we would, as a state, have to institute a
higher level of testing to move animals from state to state and
there is an economic impact to that," Fankhauser said.
Infected cattle are destroyed and their herds quarantined, said Terry
Stokes, CEO of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. When mad
cow disease was detected in some American cattle in 2004, Asian
countries restricted beef imports, hurting the U.S. beef industry.
Finding bovine tuberculosis in a herd is unlikely to result in
similar restrictions, Stokes said. "It is very isolated so it doesn't
have a universal effect on trade but it can have a regional or local
impact on trade."
Bovine tuberculosis is a serious disease caused by bacteria that
attack the respiratory system. There are 3 types of TB:
- human,
- avian,
- and bovine. It is the most infectious of the 3, capable of
infecting humans and most mammals. It is spread primarily by
respiratory aerosols being exhaled or coughed out by infected animals.
It can also spread through ingestion of infected meat and
unpasteurized, but infected, milk, said Robert Callan, associate
professor in the department of clinical sciences at Colorado State
University.
Since the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspects beef for the
disease before it is sold, and milk is routinely pasteurized, it is
unlikely that it would spread to humans, said Fankhauser. The disease
cannot be spread by beef that is cooked properly, he added.
"Getting the bull tested is a key step in protecting Colorado's
livestock," said Colorado State Veterinarian Dr. John Maulsby in a
news release. "This disease investigation has far-reaching effects,
and this is a necessary action in order for animal health officials
to effectively deal with it."
The investigation by the Colorado Department of Agriculture and the
U.S. Department of Agriculture began in January when a Douglas County
bull was sold by its Colorado owner to a meat-packing plant in San
Angelo, Texas.
During routine inspection of the carcass, lesions were discovered in
the lungs of the bull. Throughout the investigation, approximately
2000 Colorado animals have been tested.
"Colorado has been a 'TB Accredited Free State' since 1975," said
Maulsby. "State and federal officials continue to work to protect
that status."

[It is unlikely that a carcass with a lesion suspicious of TB would
have been passed by a Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS, part of
USDA) inspector. It is more likely the carcass was condemned and did
not enter the food chain.
Colorado will be doing many tracebacks to find what other herds this
animal may have come into contact with. These other herds may contain
other infected animals. If this bull has been in several states, then
those states will watch this very closely.
TB can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals. No
other TB organism has as great a host range as bovine TB, which can
infect all warm-blooded vertebrates. The causative agent of TB in
animals is _Mycobacterium bovis_. It can be transmitted by close
contact such as nose-to-nose contact or through nasal/oral
secretions. - Mod.TG]
