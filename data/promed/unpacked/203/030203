The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) has reported that Oklahoma has confirmed 3 additional cases of West Nile virus (WNV) in horses. "The Oklahoma Department of Agriculture has confirmed 3 more WNV positive horses bringing the total up to 12 for 2016," the EDCC report said.

The new cases include:

- a 6 year old quarter horse gelding from Atoka County, which was vaccinated a couple weeks prior to showing clinical signs;

- a 7 year old pony mare located in Atoka County, which was also vaccinated a couple weeks before developing clinical signs; and

- an 8 year old quarter horse gelding located in Sequoyah County with an unknown vaccination history.

West Nile is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flu-like signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculations; hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 per cent.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

A puzzler that 2/3 horses should come down with West Nile though vaccinated. The interval between vaccination, "a couple of weeks", can be any time you like between 10 days and 4 weeks. Logically they were already infected at vaccination or soon thereafter and before the vaccination could supply any protection. But it is always wise to recheck your vaccine when this happens and how it had been stored. - Mod.MHJ
