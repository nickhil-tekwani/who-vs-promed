The University of Maryland has confirmed that 3 more UMD [University of Maryland] students tested positive for adenovirus over the Thanksgiving break [22-25 Nov 2018].

University health officials had previously been aware of 6 confirmed tests, one of which resulted in the death of a student from an adenovirus-related illness.

The school has said that student well-being is a top priority, they acknowledge that mold can make people more susceptible to viral infections, but they said there is no consistent connection to the outbreak of adenovirus.

[The total number of confirmed adenovirus cases is now 9. The report does not mention the adenovirus serotype involved, or any epidemiological link/risk factors common to the cases. The mention of 'mold' as a possible risk factor would require further investigation. - Mod.UBA
