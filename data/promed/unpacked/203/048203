Knee operations postponed: investigators suspect bacteria
-------------------------
As hospitals and clinics across Minnesota postponed hundreds of knee
operations on Monday, health investigators said they were almost certain
that the deaths of 3 patients last week were caused by a rare species of
bacterium called _Clostridium sordellii_, which usually is found in animals
and soil.
The mystery is how the deadly germ could have infected 3 otherwise healthy
men, including a 23 year old, after routine knee surgery at 2 hospitals in
Alexandria and St Cloud. The highly unusual cluster of deaths prompted the
State Department of Health to make an unprecedented call Sunday for a
week-long moratorium on all elective knee surgery in Minnesota.
If this were a milder infection, we might not have taken such drastic
measures, said Dr Harry Hull, the state epidemiologist, whose team is
investigating the deaths with the United States Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. But here we had people doing fine after surgery, no reason
to think they'd have any problems at all, and then they were just crashing
and dying, Hull said.
So far, the bacterium has been found in one of the victims, the 23 year
old, and officially the cause of death remains unknown for all 3. But Hull
said that similarities in how the men died along with the bacterium's
ability to kill quickly, made it very likely that the infection led to
their deaths. _C sordellii_ produces a toxin when it invades the body, and
infection is fatal in about 50 per cent of cases. Officials have put out a
national alert to watch for other cases of the infection.
State health investigators descended on St Cloud Hospital on Monday for the
second week in a row, combing through medical records and searching for
clues and other possible victims. So far, no similar cases have turned up,
a Health Department spokesman said.
No firm link between the 3 deaths has been established. Two of the patients
-- [a 23 [year old student in Willmar and [a 78 [year old man, of
Litchfield -- had knee surgery at St Cloud Hospital on 11 Nov. [The former
had cartilage surgery, while [the latter had an artificial knee implanted.
A 60 year old man, who has not been identified, had a knee replacement at
Douglas County Hospital in Alexandria, about 70 miles away, 2 days later.
The men seemed to be recovering, then suddenly became critically ill, with
severe abdominal pain and sharp drops in blood pressure. All died within
days of the surgery.
Analysis of supplies, drugs, surgical tools and packings used by the 3
surgeons identified nothing in common, said Richard Danila, an assistant
state epidemiologist.
Another puzzle is that the infection hasn't been reported in other
patients, said William Flaig, administrator at Douglas County Hospital.
Operations were performed on patients the day before, the same day, and the
day after, [using the same rooms, the same surgeons and sometimes the same
procedures, he said.
It's extremely rare for anyone to die from knee surgery. A recent Mayo
Clinic study found that fewer than 2 in 1000 people die after knee
replacements. So 3 deaths in rapid succession quickly grabbed the attention
of state and national health officials.

Unexplained deaths following knee surgery -- Minnesota, Nov 2001
-----------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are assisting The
Minnesota Department of Health (MDOH) in the investigation of the deaths of
3 previously healthy people who died unexpectedly following uncomplicated
knee surgery.
All 3 patients became ill between one and 4 days after surgery. Symptoms
included severe abdominal pain and a sudden decline in blood pressure
followed by a fulminant course with death within 24 hours of symptom onset.
The clinical course was consistent with septic or cardiogenic shock. After
5 days of incubation, a blood culture taken from one of the patients
yielded _Clostridium sordellii_. The source of infection in the one patient
and the cause of death in all patients remain unknown.
In response to these deaths, MDOH is recommending that all elective knee
surgery in Minnesota be suspended pending findings of the investigation. To
identify possible cases in other areas, CDC is seeking reports of patients
who have had orthopedic surgery since 1 Oct 2001, involving the knee or
other large joint, and within 7 days following surgery who have had
hypotension and other clinical findings of cardiogenic or septic shock or
abdominal pain of no other identified cause and who have required intensive
care or have died. Clinicians should report such patients to their state
health department or CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion,
telephone 800-893-0485.

[_Clostridium sordellii_is an anaerobic Gram positive spore-forming
bacillus found in soil. It rarely causes human disease. A review of the
literature has revealed mostly case reports and the occasional small
"series" of case reports. Clinical presentations have included abscess with
sepsis, septic arthritis, and postpartum fatal toxic shock syndrome.
Identification of clostridium sepsis in one of the patients is intriguing
as a possible outcome of a contamination of common product/instrument used
in knee surgery or other orthopedic surgical procedures. As stated in the
MMWR article, the isolation of _C. sordellii_ from one patient so far just
confirms the probable cause of death of that one patient. Publishing a
national alert in the MMWR increases the likelihood of uncovering
additional cases if there is a problem with _C. sordellii_ contamination of
products/instruments used for orthopedic surgical procedures. Further
information is awaited. - Mod.MPP
