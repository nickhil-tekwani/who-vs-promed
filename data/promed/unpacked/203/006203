Blight threatens cardamom crop
------------------------------
Large cardamom yields are falling dramatically across the northeast Himalayas, where a fungal infection threatens one of the world's most expensive spices. Sikkim accounts for almost 90 per cent of India's large cardamom production, making India one of the world's largest producers and exporters of the spice.

But all of this is now at stake. Surveys show that within the last decade, the cultivation area of this crop dropped by half. When large cardamom production was first hit in the late 1990s, people thought it was some mysterious disease. It was only in 2011 that a group of scientists from the Indian Cardamom Research Institute discovered a fungus -- known as _Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_ -- is responsible for causing leaf blight.

Once attacked by the fungus, usually during the onset of the monsoon -- the cardamom leaves develop grey and brown patches that dry out giving a burnt appearance. The seeds of the infected plants do not mature properly and remain white or light brown rather than turning black. This blight has had a severe economic impact on farmers who depend on the cash crop. The crop is losing out to the fungus in Darjeeling [West Bengal, India], Nepal, and Bhutan as well.

Since it is a soil-borne fungus, spores stay in the soil for 10-12 years, making it difficult to get rid of. Agro-scientists are struggling to find a solution. Chemical pesticides only contained the disease for a short period: "We are now researching bio pesticides," says Tilak Gajmer, Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

Experts say climate change could be a factor behind the uncontrollable spread of the disease. Large cardamom needs a lot of moisture, but winters have become longer, drier, and warmer. Poor management of plantations is also another major factor, according to Gajmer. "We are now advising farmers to leave plantations fallow for at least 7 years to clean up the infected soil," he adds. Many farmers have shifted plantations to new areas where the soil is relatively healthy, until another solution is found.

[Large, or black, cardamom (_Amomum subulatum_; _Zingiberaceae_) is native to the Eastern Himalayas growing in cool, moist forest areas. It is a clustering plant with flower buds appearing from the base of the rhizome. Black cardamom is an important commercial crop in parts of India's Darjeeling hills, Bhutan, and Nepal. Typically, cultivation occurs in woodland areas with overhead shade and access to regular irrigation.

There is also another type of cardamom (_Elettaria cardamomum_; _Zingiberaceae_) called small, lesser, true, Malabar or green cardamom, which is an Indian native growing in tropical areas. Both black and green cardamom are highly prized spices.

_Glomerella cingulata_ (previously _Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_) is the main pathogen associated with anthracnose and blight diseases in many crops. Symptoms often include rapidly expanding brown/black leaf lesions, necrosis, defoliation, tuber rots, and dieback of entire plants. Disease development is usually favoured by humid conditions. Economic losses are due to reduced yield and severe reduction of product quality before and after harvest.

The fungus is spread mainly by infected plant material (including seeds and tubers) mechanical means (including human and insect activity) and splashing rain. It has a long saprophytic survival ability on crop residues. Disease management may include use of clean planting material, cultural techniques (including crop rotation or fallow periods between crops), phytosanitation and resistant varieties, if available. Fungicides may help to delay the onset of epidemics in some crops, but usually cannot prevent their development.

A leaf blight of black cardamom was first reported from India in the early 1980s, which was later described as anthracnose caused by _G. cingulata_. The pathogen was shown to be associated with an outbreak of cardamom leaf and sheath blight in 2006 in various districts of Sikkim and Darjeeling Hills (Saju et al, 2013, Journal of Spices and Aromatic Crops 22, 101-3) and has since become economically important for the region.
