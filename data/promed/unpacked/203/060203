>From 1 Jan 1999, 2409 cases and 361 deaths (15% CFR) of encephalitis have
been reported to the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD) of
the Department of Health Services (DHS).
Of these cases, 1149 (47% of the total cases) have been reported from
hospitals and other health institutions of the Mid-Western Regional Medical
Directorate (MWRMD), and 850 cases (35%) from the Far-Western Regional
Medical Directorate (FWRMD).
The Eastern Region Regional Medical Directorate (ERMD) has reported 254
cases (11% of the total cases), while the other two Regional Directorates
(Central and Western), have reported 88 and 68 cases respectively (4% & 3%).
Two districts, Bankey and Kailali districts, are reporting 73% of the total
cases and
70% of the total deaths. CFR [Case-Fatality Ratio in this districts stands
at 17% and 11%, respectively.
Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus has been confirmed in cases from five
districts and
three Regions of the Kingdom: Kailali District (Far-Western Region),
Bardia, Bankey and Dang Districts (Mid-Western Region) and Jhapa in the
Eastern Region.

Laboratory tests have been performed at two laboratories, using the
anti-JE-IgM
capture ELISA technique. One of the laboratories is located at the Vector
Borne
Disease, Research and Training Center (VBDRTC) in Hetauda, Makwanpur, and
the other is the U.S. Armed Forces Research Institute for Medical Sciences
(AFRIMS) laboratory located in Bangkok, Thailand.
Samples from 204 cases have been collected so far. Of these, 114 have been
unique samples (only one specimen collected) and 90 have been paired
samples (two specimens collected).
Of the samples tested so far, 137 (67%) have been positive for JE
[contained antibody to JE virus, while 20 (10%) have been negative; in 47
samples (23% of cases), JE infection could not be confirmed as a second
samples was not collected.
JE infection has been confirmed in cases from 5 districts: 55 from Bankey
district,
24 from Bardia, 13 from Dang, 8 from Kailali and 1 from Jhapa district. One
case was confirmed from a patient that came from India.
Comments
-------------
When analyzing this data, it is observed that the JE epidemic of this year
represents, so far, the second highest case-incidence of the disease since
it was detected in Nepal in 1978. This increase in the number of cases,
follows more or less the same "step ladder" pattern observed during the
last 21 years, in which "epidemic peaks" have been observed every 1-5 years.
As in previous years, in 1999 cases started to build up in the months of
April-May,
and reached their peak during the months of August and September. It is
expected that cases will start to decline by the end of September and the
beginning of October, to level off in the month of November. Same pattern
has been observed also in the past where 75% of the total cases of
encephalitis have been concentrated in the period ranging from June to
October, coinciding with the rainy season.
Analysis of age specific incidence, shows that 62% of the cases belong to
the age
group below 15 years. Same pattern has been observed along the previous
years.
Regarding sex, 54% of the patients are male and 46% female, for a
male/female ratio of 1.2:1, just below that observed during the last five
years (1.3:1).
CFR for 1999 stands at 15%, which is slightly higher than the CFR observed
in the
1997 & 1998, but still well below than that observed in previous years. No
conclusions can be made as not all data has been analyzed, and there is
still 2-3
weeks to go before the epidemic starts to level off.
Two districts (Bankey and Kailali) are reporting more than 70% of the cases
and
deaths of encephalitis. In the past 2 years, these districts have been
responsible for 65% and 42% of the total cases of encephalitis reported to
the EDCD.
The anti-JE-IgM capture ELISA technique has been utilized as the laboratory
standard procedure for the serological testing of JE in Nepal. Before
September 1999, samples for laboratory diagnosis of JE needed to be sent
abroad(India or Thailand). From 1 Sep 1999, the VBDRTC laboratory has been
upgraded to perform this test.
Laboratory results this year have confirmed that JE transmission is
occurring in both, the east and western regions of Nepal, and so far is
confined to districts located in the terai ecological region.
Of the 137 samples which were positive for JE, 73% were positive in the
first sample (acute phase specimen). In 27% of the positive JE cases, the
first sample turned out to be negative, and the infection was confirmed
only after a second sample was collected and tested.
Not having any information on when the samples were collected in respect of
the
clinical course of the illness (onset of fever), it is very difficult to
state whether, when using the anti-JE-IgM capture ELISA technique, only
one sample will be
enough to confirm the diagnosis of JE or not [see below. It may be more
accurate to say that a first specimen should be collected immediately after
the patient is admitted to the hospital (usually patients admitted to
hospitals are already having some degree of neurological involvement, thus
anti-JE-IgM levels should be already present). Nevertheless, efforts
should be made to collect a second specimen at the time of discharge or death.

[No, one sample will not be enough to make a confirmed diagnosis. In some
few people, IgM antibody may persist for many months or years (particularly
when there has been central nervous system involvement). Thus a pair of
samples always is necessary to have the possibility of making a confirmed
diagnosis. A single serum sample with IgM antibody is adequate for making
a presumptive diagnosis. I find it unusual that people infected with JE
virus do not have IgM antibody on the day of onset and thereafter for a
while, but it might happen once in a while. The incubation period for JE
is at about 5 days, sufficient time for people to mount an IgM antibody
response. Efforts should always be made to collect a second (usually
called "convalescent-phase" but the patient is not always convalescing)
sample. - Mod.CHC
