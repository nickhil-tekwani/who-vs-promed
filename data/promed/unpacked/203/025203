A Los Angeles, California boarding facility remains closed to ingress and egress after an attending veterinarian confirmed equine influenza in 2 ponies. 25 additional equines are suspected as positive, and 120 were exposed.

The affected animals, an 18-year-old Welsh pony mare and a 16-year-old Welsh pony gelding, were both under-vaccinated. The mare began experiencing signs, which included fever and cough, on 10 Dec 2020 and was confirmed positive on 16 Dec 2020. The gelding began showing signs on 11 Dec 2020 and was confirmed the same day. His signs consisted of cough, fever, and nasal discharge. Both affected animals are recovering.

Equine influenza is a highly contagious respiratory disease that infects horses, ponies, and other equids, such as donkeys, mules, and zebras. The virus that causes it is spread via saliva and respiratory secretions from infected horses. Horses are commonly exposed via horse-to-horse contact; aerosol transmission from coughing and sneezing; and contact with humans' contaminated hands, shoes, or clothes or contaminated tack, buckets, or other equipment.

Clinical signs of equine influenza infection can include a high fever (up to 106 F [41 C]); a dry, hacking cough; depression; weakness; anorexia; serous (watery) nasal discharge; and slightly enlarged lymph nodes. Consider monitoring your horse's health at shows by taking his temperature daily, which can help you pick up on signs of infection early and take appropriate measures to reduce disease spread.

Vaccination is an important and inexpensive way to protect your horse. US Equestrian requires proof that horses have had an equine influenza vaccination within the 6 months prior to attending organization-sanctioned competitions or events. Your veterinarian can help you determine what other vaccines your horse might benefit from.

In addition to vaccinating, following strict biosecurity protocols can help reduce your horse's chance of infection and disease. Such measures include quarantining new equine arrivals at barns, disinfecting buckets and equipment, and preventing nose-to-nose contact between horses.

[Caution should be exercised around equine influenza, which is caused by two subtypes of influenza A viruses. We do not want to be the reason it transfers to other horses via indirect transmission. Likewise, this disease can take a long time for the horse to recover to a pre-disease state. Be patient with your animal, and support the healing process. It is a serious disease.

"Indirect transmission can occur and can be an important means of spread. This includes transmission of the virus on clothing, equipment, brushes, shared water buckets, hands, etc.

Respiratory transmission (most common):
- Inhalation of infective droplets from coughing and snorting horses (may be able to spread as far as 50 yards by this route)
- Respiratory shedding typically lasts for 7-10 days post infection in naive animals; much shorter shedding periods occur in partially immune horses (previously vaccinated horses).

Clinical signs:
- Fever, up to 106 F (41.1 C), depression, anorexia, muscle pain/weakness.
- Dry, harsh cough (sometimes paroxysmal) usually precedes fever. The dry, harsh cough is a frequent clinical sign in equine influenza, while it is less common with EHV infection. Cough can last up to 6 weeks after other clinical signs have abated. It can take up to 6 months to regain previous athletic abilities.
- Nasal discharge is initially serous but rarely may become mucopurulent with secondary bacterial infections.
- Secondary bacterial infections are very common in influenza-affected horses.
- Slightly enlarged retropharyngeal lymph nodes.
- May be more severe in donkeys and mules.

Rare clinical signs can include distal limb edema and cardiomyopathy. Clinical signs are usually present 3-5 days after exposure (that is, 3-5-day incubation period). Clinical signs are more common and more severe in younger horses (ages 1-5 years old). Older horses usually have milder disease.

Incubation period:
Frequently as short as 24 hours and may be up to 3 days."
