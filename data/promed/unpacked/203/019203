More Cattle in Mozambique Hit by FMD
------------------------------------
The country's veterinary authorities have reported 2 new outbreaks of
foot and mouth disease (FMD), affecting cattle.

The World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE] received follow-up
report number 3 yesterday, 28 Dec 2010. The outbreaks have occurred
in 2 villages (Munhuana and Mangandlane) in Maputo.

The report states that the outbreak in Mangandlane is an extension of
the initial outbreak due to illegal cattle movement and exchanges of
labourers between both communities.

A total of 4010 animals were found susceptible to the disease, out of
which 179 tested positive.

The 3 main sources for the outbreak have been identified as:
- Illegal movement of animals;
- Contact with infected animal(s) at grazing/watering sites;
- Fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc.)

The event was caused by SAT 2 serotype according to the results from
Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (OVI) and Botswana Vaccine Institute (BVI).
