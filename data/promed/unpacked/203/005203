Belarus: 30 hospitalized after eating meat from rabid cow
------------------------------------------------
About 30 people have been taken to hospital in Hantsavichy, Brest Region,
after eating meat from a rabid cow, Belapan news agency reported on 19
Oct 2000.
This was the first case of its kind in the Region. The farm where the
infected animal was slaughtered is under quarantine and all the
livestock, including domestic animals, are being vaccinated. Altogether
this year in Brest Region there have been over 30 cases of rabies
discovered in foxes, cows, cats and dogs, the highest number for 20
years. The reason is not only the cyclical nature of the disease but an
increasing number of foxes and wolves together with a virtual halt to
hunting.

Rabies - Belarus (Grodno Region)
---------------------------------
Valeriy Pogol'ko, the head of the special pathogen branch of the Grodno
Region Center of Hygiene and Epidemiology, said the [number of cases of
rabies in animals has been sharply increased in Grodno Region. At the
present time there are reasons to say a "common joint focus" of the animal
rabies has been formed in the Grodno area. The main carriers of
dangerous virus are foxes. 32 rabies foci have been registered in the
region. Shchuchin, Dyatlovo, Vronov, and Ostrovets districts are the
most unfavorable in this regard. From the lab investigation of 120 animals,
there were 64 confirmed rabies cases, among them 45 foxes.
V. Podol'ko also noted [that during the last 2 weeks 56 people have been
admitted
to medical [facilities for help regarding animal bites. This situation needs
adequate measures and activities to prevent the disease from spreading
among animals. First of all, a fox catch and immunization of the
domestic animals [would be indicated.
