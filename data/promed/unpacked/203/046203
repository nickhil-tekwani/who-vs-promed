The total number of deaths in the state due to Japanese encephalitis (JE) and AES [acute encephalitis syndrome], which is a cluster of diseases, involving the brain, has now gone up to 4 this year [2022]. Of the 4 encephalitis deaths in Bihar this year, 3 were known cases of AES and one of JE. One death each has been reported in Sitamarhi, Vaishali, Patna and Muzaffarpur districts, said state health officials.

A 3-year old female child, SK, died of acute AES at the Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital (SKMCH) in Bihar's Muzaffarpur district, around 72 km [approx. 45 mi] north of Patna, on [Tue 31 May 2022], evening hospital officials said on [Wed 1 Jun 2022]. SKMCH superintendent, Dr. Babu Saheb Jha confirmed that the child died of AES on [Tue 31 May 2022].

SK, who was brought to the SKMCH on [Tue 31 May 2022] from Muzaffarpur's Kanti block, a distance of around 16 km [approx. 10 mi], died the same day. This is the first child death so far this year [2022] due to AES the same day as being admitted to a medical college hospital. This points to a delay in getting the patient to the SKMCH, a tertiary care centre that has 100 beds in the paediatric intensive care unit.

"SK, developed convulsion at 5am on [Tue 31 May 2022], despite having had dinner the previous day. DP, her father, who is my brother, took her to the Kanti health facility around 8am. She was subsequently referred to the SKMCH, but she died there later in the evening," said SD, the victim's paternal aunt.

The state health department issued a 3-point advisory, called "Chamki ko Dhamki" [local term for AES], in April 2020, advising people to compulsorily feed children at night, check for convulsion or loss of consciousness in the morning and to rush such patients to the nearest health centre.

The state government has also tied up at least 2 vehicles per panchayat [village council] under the chief minister's rural transportation scheme and allows reimbursement of fares of Indian rupee between 400 and 1,000 [USD 5 and 13] to transport AES children to the nearest health facility by any mode of transport, even if it was a private vehicle.

Up until [Tue 31 May 2022], the SKMCH has reported 45 admissions of children suffering from AES, of which 41 have been cured and discharged, 3 died and one left against medical advice.

Bihar, until [Tue 30 May 2022], reported 56 cases of AES/JE across its 12 AES-endemic districts of which 28 were from Muzaffarpur, 7 from East Champaran, 5 from Sitamarhi, 4 from Saran, 3 from Vaishali, 2 each from Patna and West Champaran and one each from Araria, Jehanabad, Khagaria, Samastipur and Jamui.

[This is the season when encephalitis cases in children in northwestern India, including Bihar state, are reported. Some are diagnosed as Japanese encephalitis and many others such as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) without specifying the etiology of the disease. On 24 Apr 2022, Dr. T. Jacob John, Former (retired) Professor of Clinical Virology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India, offered this useful comment about AES (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (04): comment 20220425.8702831). "The term acute encephalitis syndrome ([AES) was coined by the WHO in 2008 and since then it has become very popular. The government of India has endorsed it on the official website.

"WHO has been promoting syndromic diagnoses for a variety of conditions, but this one, AES, has led to death due to misdiagnosis in many children. Such a diagnostic term covers acute encephalitis (mostly viral such as JE, herpes simplex, West Nile), acute encephalopathy (mostly biochemical and non-infectious, such as hypoglycemic encephalopathy, heat hyperpyrexia, Reye syndrome), pyogenic meningitis (pneumococcal or _H. influenzae_ b, occasionally _N. meningitides_), cerebral complications of systemic diseases (scrub typhus, leptospirosis, chikungunya), TB meningitis, viral meningitis, cerebral malaria, brain abscess, etc., is not only unscientific but also unethical as it condones lack of further investigations, even a lumbar puncture.

"When clusters of cases are reported, the disease is taken as JE without protocol-based investigations. Acute encephalopathy and scrub typhus also may occur in clusters.

"I had repeatedly condemned this shortcut diagnostic term, which I declare is not a diagnostic term at all. Each child with brain fever (translation of 'chamki buckar') deserves an etiology-specific diagnosis, and the term AES is better avoided in clinical practice.

"There are 2 useful references:
- John TJ, Verghese VP, Arunkumar G, et al. The syndrome of acute encephalitis in children in India: Need for new thinking. Indian J Med Res 2017; 146(2): 158-161. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5761025/, and
- Sarkar A, Datta D, Datta SK, and John TJ. Acute encephalopathy in children in Muzaffarpur, India: a review of aetiopathogenesis. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 2020; 114(9): 704-711; https://academic.oup.com/trstmh/article-abstract/114/9/704/5854775."

Dr. John makes a very strong case for the need to make specific diagnoses.

Health officials frequently state that preventive measures will be taken. For Japanese encephalitis, vaccination campaigns are undertaken that are effective in preventing infection by this virus. However, until the specific agents and conditions responsible for AES that Dr. John lists above are accurately diagnosed, prevention of this condition will not be possible. - Mod.TY
