A team of lawmakers which reached Nepalgunj on Saturday [7 Aug 2010] to
inspect various areas of Banke district affected by cholera started work on
Sunday [8 Aug 2010]. Earlier today, 8 Aug 2010, the house team met the
chief of the District Public Health (DPH) office and inquired about the
latest developments to bring the outbreak under control.

The Constituent Assembly [CA] secretariat on Saturday [7 Aug 2010] decided
to send some lawmakers under the coordination of CA member Sandhya Dev to
Banke following reports of gross negligence to control the disease. The DPH
office had confirmed the occurrence of cholera in some of the patients
undergoing treatment at various hospitals in the district on 3 Aug 2010.

At least 6 people have died and over 500 others have been affected in the
district due to the outbreak that spread in the district in the past 2 weeks.

[3] Cholera, locally acquired - China (Hong Kong)
Date: Sat 7 Aug 2010

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today
(7 Aug 2010) investigating a confirmed case of cholera and reminds people
to observe good personal, food, and environmental hygiene, whether in Hong
Kong or travelling abroad. The case involved a 66 year old woman who was a
food collateral of a cholera case (index case) confirmed on 5 Aug 2010. She
developed diarrhea on 2 Aug 2010.

Her symptoms subsided after one day without seeking medical attention. Her
stool specimen collected by CHP during the investigation of the index case
on 5 Aug 2010 grew _Vibrio cholerae_ today [7 Aug 2010]. CHP's
investigation revealed that the woman shared meals with the index case on 5
Aug 2010 in 4 food premises during the incubation period.

Both of them are now being treated in isolation at Princess Margaret
Hospital, and are in a stable condition. The woman did not have history of
recent travel. She lives in Sham Shiu Po and her home contacts have no
symptoms of cholera. Investigation continues and contacts of the patients
are under medical surveillance. This is the 5th case of cholera reported in
2010. There were 7 cholera cases in 2008, 3 cholera cases in 2007, 1 in
2006, and 5 in 2005.

[4] Cholera - Papua New Guinea

The cholera outbreak in Papua New Guinea remains a problem, a year after it
began. The head of the Cholera Taskforce in the National Capital District,
Dr Tim Pyakalyia, says people continue to be admitted to hospital with
suspected cholera, with 8 more in Port Moresby this week [week of 2 Aug 2010].

He says about 1200 people in the capital are still [probably meant to say
have been - Mod.LL] affected by the disease and an upgrade of the water
system is still essential.

"Biggest problem in the city is a lack of proper water and sanitation. And
public facilities like public toilets in the markets where we don't have
proper running water and the functioning toilets. So this is the major
challenge that the city is facing." Dr Tim Pyakalia says at the same time
the health sector is focusing on training staff to better deal with the
cholera issue.

The disease first surfaced in August 2090 in Morobe Province and has since
spread to Lae, Madang, East Sepik, and the capital, Port Moresby.

Agbulos said 17 of the 30 confirmed cases of cholera in sitio Tindalo,
barangay Vitali, remain at the Vitali Community Hospital. 1 fatality, a 3
year old child, was reported. He said patients complained of severe stomach
ache, vomiting, and loose bowel movements. The contaminated water from the
deep well, which is the only source of water in the area, was confirmed as
the root cause of the infection.

A cholera-like epidemic is widely spreading in Bhingar and the adjoining
camp areas in Ahmednagar and about 500 people have fallen sick with it,

special cell has been opened there. 30 patients are from Bhingar.

[8] Diarrhea - Viet Nam (22): (southern provinces) cholera suspected

<http://english.vovnews.vn/Home/Acute-diarrhoea-spreads-across-southern-provinces/20107/117836.vov>


An acute diarrhea epidemic is spreading far and wide in southern provinces,
including Cau Mau, An Giang, Ben Tre, and Can Tho City, according to the
Department of Preventive Health and the Environment [Ministry of Health].

Nguyen Van Binh, vice director of the department, says that about 70 per
cent of the contracted cases show minor symptoms or none of the symptoms of
the disease. He said it is difficult to control the number of newly
infected cases, as most of them are not hospitalized for clinical
examinations. Binh also warns that _Vibrio cholerae_ bacterium can be
detected in ice water, canals, and even dog meat.

The acute diarrhea epidemic has shown signs of waning in the northern
region with no new cases reported over the past weeks.

[9] Diarrhea - Cambodia (Prey Veng) cholera suspected
Date: Mon 26 Jul 2010

<http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2010072640760/National-news/prey-veng-prisoners-stricken-by-sickness.html>


An outbreak of acute watery diarrhea cases in Prey Veng provincial prison
has stricken 63 inmates, 5 of whom are in serious condition, the country's
top prison official said yesterday [25 Jul 2010].

One inmate died of the illness late last week [week of 19 Jul 2010] after
being taken to hospital, but Heng Hak, director of the Interior Ministry's
General Department of Prisons, said yesterday [25 Jul 2010] that many of
the sick prisoners were recovering.

"In Prey Veng prison, only one prisoner has died because of diarrhea, while
the number of inmates with diarrhea has increased to 63," Heng Hak said.
"Only 5 patients are in serious condition, while the others are only
slightly ill because they received medical treatment on time." He added
that he was concerned the inmates might be sick with cholera.

Nou Sophal, technical director of the Prey Veng Health Department, said
yesterday [25 Jul 2010] that he did not know whether tests were being run
for cholera.

A report released by the rights group Licadho last week [week of 19 Jul
2010] warned that Cambodia's prisons could be the most overcrowded in the
world in fewer than 10 years unless steps are taken to reduce inmate
totals. Overcrowding exacerbates poor hygiene and contributes to the spread
of illnesses such as diarrhea.

The outbreak in Prey Veng marks at least the 3rd time since May [2010] that
prison officials have sought intervention from health officials to address
a diarrhea outbreak.

In May [2010], Pursat provincial prison saw 54 inmates fall ill, Phun
Chhin, a prison researcher for Licadho, said yesterday [25 Jul 2010]. He
added, though, that the situation in the facility had since improved. "It
is better for the present time. Recently, the prisoners haven't encountered
[diarrhoea] again after they improved their sanitation and started drinking
boiled water," he said.

Earlier this month [July 2010], officials at Preah Sihanouk provincial
prison sent 5 inmates to hospital after 10 came down with severe vomiting
and diarrhea, an outbreak that was also attributed to poor sanitation.
