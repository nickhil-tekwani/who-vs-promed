[1] Children: severe disease

Pediatric researchers are investigating whether COVID-19 is becoming more severe for children now that variants are causing localized flareups, even as US cases overall decline.

By early April [2021], the rate of COVID-19 cases in young kids and early teens began surpassing that of those 65 and older, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The latest CDC data suggest the trend is continuing. At the same time, hospitalizations for children with COVID-19 aren't falling as much as for those 18 and up. That has researchers concerned that variants may be affecting youths in new ways, including a rare inflammatory disease that has been linked to COVID-19 infection.

"The big concern is that we've left a whole population of children unprotected," said Adrienne Randolph, a critical-care doctor at Boston Children's Hospital who is leading the CDC-funded research.

Cases of the rare disease, called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, totaled more than 2000 in February [2021] and surpassed 3000 by 1 Apr [2021], according to the CDC, which will soon update its tally. Vaccine manufacturers' clinical trials have mostly focused on adults, and now almost 72% of those 65 and older are fully inoculated, according to the CDC. Meanwhile, young children don't yet have access to shots, and companies are still studying the effects on them. Pfizer Inc.'s vaccine has been available for teens 16 and older and won authorization Monday [10 May 2021] for ages 12-15 years [see ProMED post 20210511.8356523].

The vaccines have been found to work well in adults against the current virus mutations, including the B.1.1.7 variant identified in the UK. Still, pockets of unvaccinated people are giving the variant room to spread, which may be especially worrisome for children. That variant, which is more contagious than the original virus, became the most dominant strain in the USA in early April [2021] and now makes up almost 60% of cases, according to the CDC.

In Colorado, which has one of the country's highest infection rates, Sam Dominguez, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Children's Hospital Colorado, started to see an increase in cases of the rare inflammatory disease at the end of April [2021].

MIS-C typically appears about one month after a COVID-19 infection. It can be deadly, but it's also rare. It can inflame different parts of the body, including the heart, lungs, brain, and gastrointestinal system, according to the CDC. Symptoms vary from abdominal pain to diarrhea or bloodshot eyes. Most cases occurred in children between 1 and 14, with a median age of 9, according to the CDC.

Like the rest of the country, Colorado saw a surge in COVID-19 cases between November [2020] and February [2021]. Cases started ticking up again last month [April 2021]. B.1.1.7 is the dominant variant.

"We're watching it very carefully," Dominguez said. "I think that's a really important question: Does B.1.1.7 cause more MIS-C?"

Newer variants are emerging as well. A Colorado public health official said Thursday [6 May 2021] that a strain called B.1.617.2, first found in India, has been identified in Mesa County, according to the Denver Post. "Mortality, thankfully, is low, but that doesn't mean there's not morbidity," Randolph said. "Some have to go to rehab, some go home on oxygen."

Randolph had been studying MIS-C and severe COVID-19 as part of an earlier study backed by USD 2.1 million from the CDC. The work was renewed 4 May [2021] and will look at whether the virus is taking a bigger toll on children, Randolph said.

She plans to go back through data over the past few months as she and her team collect new reports -- some 50 pages long -- from a nationwide network of pediatric health centers. If they find worrisome patterns, they'll "report findings as soon as we can," she said.

Randolph has found that children with severe COVID-19 tend to have underlying conditions that make them susceptible, just like adults. But pediatric MIS-C patients tend to be healthy and without COVID-19 symptoms. The study will also examine vaccine effectiveness in children.

"The question is, what is B.1.1.7 going to do in the many states that are out there with lower vaccination rates? And we just don't know that," said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, who also advised President Joseph Biden on COVID-19 during his transition.

Children may be more vulnerable in states with low vaccination rates. Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Wyoming, and Idaho are the 5 worst-performing when measured by percent of population with at least one shot, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. Most aren't seeing a rise in cases currently. That could change.

"Last summer [2020], we saw a huge surge in cases in these Southern states, likely tied to people going into air conditioning in the hot summer months," said Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and researcher at Brown University in Rhode Island. "If vaccination rates do not increase, it is likely there will be recurrent surges."

The risk for kids will likely come from afterschool programs and seeing their friends, rather than classroom activities themselves, she said. "When kids go back to school, they also go back to socializing, the extracurricular activities," Ranney said. "In those situations, they're often not masked, not in well-ventilated spaces."

[Vaccination of 12- to 15-year-old children should provide some protection against MIS-C, which mostly affects children between 1 and 14, with a median age of 9 years. But those children under the age of 12 are still high risk.

"Of all the COVID-19 cases (in France), 58% are infected with the variant B.1.1.7. But in the 0-9 age group, the variant's spread is at 68%."

"Dr. A Somer (Istanbul University Medical Department) noted that there wasn't a definitive explanation as to why children younger than 9 were affected more from COVID-19 and said that it could be explained by their weaker immune system. 'It could also be that they fail to keep social distancing or in wearing masks, because children in this age-group are far more social beings'" (excerpted from https://www.dailysabah.com/life/science/british-covid-19-variant-more-infectious-in-children-data-shows). - Mod.LK]

[2] Taiwan, Singapore: new restrictions
Date: Tue 11 May 2021
Source: MSN/Bloomberg News [abridged, edited]
https://bit.ly/3hjduGj


Taiwan announced limits on crowds, following Singapore's move to restrict foreign workers, in a wave of new restrictions in Asian countries trying to stamp out small outbreaks after months of keeping COVID-19 contained.

The new curbs prompted fears that economic growth could stall out, leading to stock selloffs in both countries this week. Low vaccination rates in both countries are contributing to concerns that their populations could be vulnerable if faster-spreading variants take hold.

In Taiwan, indoor gatherings will be limited to fewer than 100 people and outdoor events capped at 500 for the next 4 weeks, Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control said in a statement Tuesday [11 May 2021]. It's the 1st time the island has tightened anti-COVID measures since it began easing curbs mid-last year [2020] and comes after the government reported 7 new cases in the community and 4 in travelers from overseas.

Singapore -- the city-state that is ranked the best place to be in the coronavirus era by Bloomberg's COVID Resilience Ranking -- has also been tightening up restrictions amid a sudden recurrence of local infections, limiting social gatherings and upping border curbs. The co-chair of Singapore's virus task force, Lawrence Wong, said Tuesday [11 May 2021] that companies looking to bring in foreign workers from higher-risk nations could face delays of more than 6 months because of the greater vigilance. The country has also begun mass testing all hospital staff in an attempt to fence off infections, after a cluster of cases emerged at a medical center.

The 2 places are among the handful in the world that have virtually eliminated COVID domestically, among them Australia, New Zealand, and China -- where cases of the new coronavirus first emerged more than a year ago. The return to tighter curbs risks disrupting what has been months of largely normal social activity in Taiwan and Singapore should the outbreaks persist.

Taiwan has been so successful at keeping COVID-19 in check that it's struggling to persuade its population to get vaccinated, with less than 1% inoculated thus far. Singapore has done better, at 19%, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. Higher rates would let both countries confidently open up to international travelers.

While having a zero-tolerance approach to infections has meant very few deaths in these places, they're now lagging countries like the USA and Israel on vaccination, which could put them at a disadvantage as parts of the world start to open up to international travel.

After an initial outbreak of cases very early in the pandemic, Taiwan has managed to basically keep the virus out, even going more than 8 months without a single domestic infection between April and December [2020]. The island has had just over 1200 cases and 12 deaths in total since COVID-19 first emerged.

Taiwan's success has meant it never imposed stringent restrictions internally, like lockdowns. Businesses, government offices and schools have remained open throughout much of the pandemic, although municipal authorities canceled their usual large-scale Lunar New Year holiday celebrations in February [2021] as a precaution.

In recent weeks, health authorities in Taiwan have been battling a steady rise in infections centered around a hotel used to quarantine pilots for local carrier China Airlines returning from overseas. Investors showed their concern by selling Taiwanese shares, with the benchmark Taiex index falling almost 3.8% Tuesday [11 May 2021], the biggest decline among Asian markets. The Taiwan dollar weakened by the most since 26 Mar [2021].

Elsewhere in Asia, cases are also coming back, with India now the epicenter of the global crisis, recording more than 329 000 new cases Tuesday [11 May 2021]. Malaysia is tightening curbs on people's movements across the country after daily cases exceeded 3000 this month [May 2021] for the 1st time since February [2021].

The detection of the one case with [the COVID-19 variant first reported in India] has added to the risk, and Malaysia is struggling with the pace of vaccinations. Less than 3% of the population had completed their vaccination series as of 9 May [2021], data compiled by Bloomberg show. That tally trails Indonesia and Singapore and puts Malaysia at risk of falling short of its vaccination target for the year [2021].

[It is of concern that 6 of the cases in Taiwan had no clear source of infection, especially when less than 1% of the population is immunized. The rise in cases centered around a hotel used to quarantine pilots is particularly troublesome. This is a situation where rapid tests could be very effective. - Mod.LK]

[3] Asia
Date: Tue 11 May 2021

India's tragic COVID surge is showing no letup, as daily cases stay above the 300 000 mark with more grim examples of people's desperation, including scores of bodies turning up in some of the country's rivers. Increases elsewhere in Asia are also raising concerns, even in Taiwan, which has been widely praised for keeping cases and deaths at extremely low levels.

After 4 days of daily cases above 400 000, India's daily totals have dropped slightly, but the virus is now spreading to more rural areas amid continued grim reports from the pandemic's worst surge. Global health officials have said they believe India's officials figures are a vast undercount of its disease burden.

Overburdened crematories and high-priced services are driving some poorer people to dispose of their loved one's bodies in rivers, including the sacred Ganges, medical workers told The New York Times. (https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/05/11/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-cases#bodies-wash-up-on-the-banks-of-indias-holiest-river-as-the-virus-spreads-nationwide).

Meanwhile, India's doctors are urging people not to cover their bodies with cow dung, a practice that some believe will boost immunity to the virus or help with illness recovery, according to Reuters. Doctors warned that there is no scientific evidence of effectiveness and that the practice could pose other disease risks (https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indian-doctors-warn-against-cow-dung-covid-cure-2021-05-11/). The practice is tied to the Hindu belief that cows -- thought to be sacred -- are symbols of life and that cow dung and urine has therapeutic and antiseptic properties.

In Japan, also battling a recent surge linked to more transmissible variants, the public is voicing discontent with the government's handling of the pandemic and whether the postponed Summer Olympics [2020] should proceed this summer [2021] in Tokyo, according to Reuters. An upcoming visit from the head of the International Olympics Committee, Thomas Bach, has been postponed due to a state of emergency extension in Tokyo.

In Osaka Prefecture, a growing number of people are dying from COVID at home, given the limited number of critical care beds, an expert from Osaka City University told Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japanese-prefecture-says-deaths-home-surge-amid-4th-covid-19-wave-2021-05-11/).

Also, Taiwan raised its alert level and re-imposed distancing and mask rules after 2 new local clusters were found, according to the South China Morning Post. Officials also limited visits at hospitals and nursing homes for the next 4 weeks (https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3133091/taiwan-back-coronavirus-alert-local-clusters-grow).

More global headlines
- Though Africa's overall cases and deaths have decreased for the 3rd week in a row, 11 countries are reporting increased cases, with South Africa and Uganda reporting the biggest rises, the WHO's African regional office said yesterday [10 May 2021] in its weekly outbreaks and health emergencies report. "The overwhelming increase in cases and deaths in India, and increases in other regions of the world, are clear signs that the pandemic is not yet over in African countries," the group said.

- An official from France's health ministry said the country will donate more than 5% of its COVID vaccine supply to the WHO-led COVAX program.

- Australia's Victoria state reported its 1st case in about 2 months, in a man who had recently traveled internationally and went through the quarantine process in South Australia state. He returned to Victoria on 4 May [2021], and his symptoms began on May 8 [2021]. He tested positive for COVID-19 2 days later, and health officials are investigating how he was infected.

- The global pandemic total today passed 159 million and is now at 159 172 466 cases, along with 3 308 698 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).

[4] Vaccine: Sinovac
Date: Wed 12 May 2021
Source: Bloomberg News [edited]
https://www.bloombergquint.com/coronavirus-outbreak/china-s-sinovac-shot-found-highly-effective-in-real-world-study


Sinovac Biotech Ltd.'s vaccine is wiping out COVID-19 among health workers in Indonesia, an encouraging sign for the dozens of developing countries reliant on the controversial Chinese shot, which performed far worse than western vaccines in clinical trials.

Indonesia tracked 128 290 health workers in capital city Jakarta from January to March [2021] and found that the vaccine protected 98% of them from death and 96% from hospitalization as soon as 7 days after the 2nd dose, Pandji Dhewantara, a Health Ministry official who oversaw the study, said in a Wednesday [12 May 2021] press conference. Dhewantara also said that 94% of the workers had been protected against symptomatic infection, an extraordinary result that goes beyond what was measured in the shot's numerous clinical trials. Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin earlier revealed a smaller version of the study involving 25 374 people in a Tuesday [11 May 2021] interview with Bloomberg that had the same effectiveness data for hospitalization and infection. Protection against death was 100% in the smaller group.

"We see a very, very drastic drop" in hospitalizations and deaths among medical workers, Sadikin said. It's not known what strain of the coronavirus Sinovac's shot worked against in Indonesia, but the country has not flagged any major outbreaks driven by variants of concern.

The data adds to signs out of Brazil that the Sinovac shot is more effective than it proved in the testing phase, which was beset by divergent efficacy rates and questions over data transparency. Results from its biggest Phase III trial in Brazil put the shot known as CoronaVac's efficacy at just above 50%, the lowest among all 1st-generation COVID vaccines.

In a separate interview with Bloomberg Tuesday [11 May 2021], Sinovac's chief executive officer Yin Weidong defended the disparity in clinical data around the shot and said there was growing evidence CoronaVac is performing better when applied in the real world.

[This is welcome news, adding another effective vaccine to the fight against SARS-CoV-2. The following piece from the New York Times, 7 May 2021, explains how Sinovac is produced. The online article has very informative, easily understandable graphics for those who are not familiar with the procedure. It is a killed (inactivated) vaccine.

"The private Chinese company Sinovac developed a coronavirus vaccine called CoronaVac. The vaccine is approved for use in China and authorized for emergency use in more than a dozen other countries. In a trial in Brazil, researchers found it had an efficacy against infections with or without symptoms of 50.65%. In a trial in Turkey, researchers found it had an efficacy of 91.25% against COVID-19 infections with symptoms.

"CoronaVac works by teaching the immune system to make antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The antibodies attach to viral proteins, such as the so-called spike proteins that stud its surface.

"To create CoronaVac, the Sinovac researchers started by obtaining samples of the coronavirus from patients in China, Britain, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland. One sample from China eventually served as the basis for the vaccine.

"The researchers grew large stocks of the coronavirus in monkey kidney cells. Then they doused the viruses with a chemical called beta-propiolactone. The compound disabled the coronaviruses by bonding to their genes. The inactivated coronaviruses could no longer replicate. But their proteins, including spike, remained intact.

"The researchers then drew off the inactivated viruses and mixed them with a tiny amount of an aluminum-based compound called an adjuvant. Adjuvants stimulate the immune system to boost its response to a vaccine.

"Inactivated viruses have been used for over a century. Jonas Salk used them to create his polio vaccine in the 1950s, and they're the bases for vaccines against other diseases including rabies and hepatitis A.

"Because the coronaviruses in CoronaVac are dead, they can be injected into the arm without causing COVID-19. Once inside the body, some of the inactivated viruses are swallowed up by a type of immune cell called an antigen-presenting cell.

"The antigen-presenting cell tears the coronavirus apart and displays some of its fragments on its surface. A so-called helper T cell may detect the fragment. If the fragment fits into one of its surface proteins, the T cell becomes activated and can help recruit other immune cells to respond to the vaccine.

"Another type of immune cell, called a B cell, may also encounter the inactivated coronavirus. B cells have surface proteins in a huge variety of shapes, and a few might have the right shape to latch onto the coronavirus. When a B cell locks on, it can pull part or all of the virus inside and present coronavirus fragments on its surface.

"A helper T cell activated against the coronavirus can latch onto the same fragment. When that happens, the B cell gets activated too. It proliferates and pours out antibodies that have the same shape as their surface proteins.

"Once vaccinated with CoronaVac, the immune system can respond to an infection of live coronaviruses. B cells produce antibodies that stick to the invaders. Antibodies that target the spike protein can prevent the virus from entering cells. Other kinds of antibodies may block the virus by other means.

While CoronaVac can offer some protection against COVID-19, no one can yet say how long that protection lasts. It's possible that the level of antibodies drops over the course of months. But the immune system also contains special cells called memory B cells that might retain information about the coronavirus for years or even decades" (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/sinovac-covid-19-vaccine.html). - Mod.LK]

[5] WHO Weekly epidemiological update (11 May 2021)
Date: Tue 11 May 2021
Source: WHO Emergency situational update [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---11-may-2021


Data as received by WHO from national authorities, as of 10 a.m. CET 9 May 2021

Overview
Global overview: The number of new COVID-19 cases and deaths globally slightly decreased this week, with over 5.5 million cases and over 90 000 deaths. Case and death incidences, however, remain at the highest levels since the beginning of the pandemic. New weekly cases decreased in the regions of Europe and Eastern Mediterranean, while the South-East Asia Region continued an upward trajectory for 9 weeks and reported a further 6% increase last week.

Special focus: In this edition, special focus updates are provided on 4 SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern [B.1.1.7 (VOC202012/01); B.1.351 (501Y.V2); P.1; B.1.617] and 6 variants of interest, including the geographic distribution, and phenotypic impacts on transmissibility, vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.

WHO, in collaboration with national authorities, institutions and researchers, routinely assesses if variants of SARS-CoV-2 result in changes in transmissibility, clinical presentation, and severity, or if they result in changes in public health and social measures (PHSM) implementation by national health authorities. Systems have been established to detect "signals" of potential variants of concern (VOCs) or variants of interest (VOIs) and assess these based on the risk posed to global public health (see also working definitions). National authorities may choose to designate other variants of local interest/concern. Detailed information on currently circulating VOCs and VOIs is available in previously published editions of the Weekly Epidemiological Update. Here we provide information on a newly designated VOC within lineage B.1.617, and provide an update on the geographical distribution, and emerging evidence surrounding phenotypic characteristics of all designated VOIs and VOCs.

Newly designated VOC within lineage B.1.617
--------------------------------------
In consultation with the WHO SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution Working Group, WHO has determined that viruses within the lineage B.1.617 have been characterized as a VOC. B.1.617 contains 3 sub-lineages (Table 2), which differ by few but potentially relevant mutations in the spike protein as well as prevalence of detection globally. As of 11 May [2021], over 4500 sequences have been uploaded to GISAID and assigned to B.1.617 from 44 countries in all 6 WHO regions, and WHO has received reports of detections from 5 additional countries (Figure 3). Though there may be important differences among the 3 sublineages, currently available evidence is too limited for VOI/VOC characterization by sublineage. Future delineation of sublineages as VOIs/VOCs may be possible as our understanding by sublineage and relative importance of their epidemiology increases. At the present time, WHO has designated B.1.617 as a VOC based on early evidence of phenotypic impacts compared to other circulating virus variants, namely:

- B.1.617 sublineages appear to have higher rates of transmission, including observed rapid increases in prevalence in multiple countries (moderate evidence available for B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2), and

- Preliminary evidence suggests potential reduced effectiveness of Bamlanivimab, a monoclonal antibody used for COVID-19 treatment, and potentially slightly reduced susceptibility to neutralisation antibodies (limited evidence available for B.1.617.1).

Viruses in the B.1.617 lineage were first reported in India in October 2020. The resurgence in COVID-19 cases and deaths in India has raised questions on the potential role of B.1.617 and other variants (e.g., B.1.1.7) in circulation. A recent risk assessment of the situation in India conducted by WHO found that resurgence and acceleration of COVID-19 transmission in India had several potential contributing factors, including increase in the proportion of cases of SARS-CoV-2 variants with potentially increased transmissibility; several religious and political mass gathering events that increased social mixing; and under use of and reduced adherence to public health and social measures (PHSM). The exact contributions of these each of these factors on increased transmission in India are not well understood.

Approximately 0.1% of positive samples in India have been sequenced and uploaded to GISAID to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants. The prevalence of several VOCs including B.1.1.7 and B.1.617 sublineages increased concurrent to the surge in COVID-19 cases reported in India. While B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.1 variants have begun to wane in recent weeks, a marked increase in the proportion of viruses sequenced as B.1.617.2 has been observed over the same period. Since the identification of these variants through late April 2021, B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 accounted for 21% and 7% of sequenced samples from India, respectively.

Preliminary analyses conducted by WHO using sequences submitted to GISAID suggests that B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 have a substantially higher growth rate than other circulating variants in India, suggesting potential increased transmissibility compared. Too few sequences of B.1.617.3 have been detected to date to assess its relative transmissibility.

Other studies suggest that the case numbers increased more rapidly during the most recent surge when variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.617 were circulating, compared to the 1st surge (June to October 2020). A structural analysis of B.1.617 receptor binding domain (RBD) mutations (L452R and E484Q, along with P681R in the furin cleavage site) suggest that mutations in these variants may result in increased ACE2 binding and rate of S1-S2 cleavage, resulting in better transmissibility, and possibly capacity to escape binding and neutralization by some monoclonal antibodies.

In a preliminary study on hamsters, infection with B.1.617.1 resulted in increased body weight loss, higher viral load in lungs, and pronounced lung lesions as compared to B.1 variants (D614G).

Potential impacts of B.1.617 lineage on effectiveness of vaccines or therapeutics, or reinfection risks, remain uncertain. Preliminary laboratory studies awaiting peer review suggest a limited reduction in neutralisation by antibodies; however, real-world impacts may be limited. One study found a 7-fold reduction in neutralization effectiveness against B.1.617.1 of antibodies generated by vaccination with Moderna - mRNA-1273 and Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty vaccines. A 2nd study also found a reduction in neutralization against virus carrying the E484Q mutation (contained in B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.3) for Pfizer BioNTech - Comirnaty vaccine, similar to that found with the E484K mutation. A 3rd study reviewing a limited sample of convalescent sera of COVID-19 cases (n=17) and sera from recipients of the Bharat - Covaxin vaccine (n=23) concluded that most neutralizing activity against B.1.617 was retained. A 4th study reported an approximately 3-fold decrease in neutralization activity by plasma from recipients of Pfizer BioNTech - Comirnaty vaccine (n=15) against B.1.617, and a limited 2-fold decrease by convalescent sera from cases with severe COVID-19 (n=15). The same study showed that B.1.617.1 (with additional spike mutations R21T, and Q218H) mediates increased entry into certain human and intestinal cell lines and was resistant to the monoclonal antibody Bamlanivimab; however, it was efficiently inhibited by Imdevimab and by a cocktail of Casirivimab and Imdevimab.

Outside of India, the United Kingdom has reported the largest number of cases sequenced as B.1.617 sub-lineages, and recently designated B.1.617.2 as a national variant of concern. This follows a recent steep increase in the number of cases sequenced as B.1.617 sublineages, and a national assessment that characterized B.1.617.2 as at least equivalent in terms of transmissibility as VOC B.1.1.7; however, they noted insufficient data to assess the potential for immune escape. As of 5 May [2021], the United Kingdom has reported 520 genomically confirmed B.1.617.2 cases (of which approximately 2/3 were domestically acquired), 261 confirmed B.1.617 cases (without further delineation), and 9 confirmed B.1.617.3 cases.

Further robust studies into the phenotypic impacts of these variants, including impacts on epidemiological characteristics (transmissibility, severity, re-infection risk, etc.) and impact on countermeasures, are urgently needed.

Other VOCs
-----------------
As surveillance activities to detect SARS-CoV-2 variants are strengthened at local and national levels, including by strategic genomic sequencing, the number of countries/areas/territories (hereafter countries) reporting VOCs and VOIs has continued to increase. Since our last update on 4 May [2021], VOC 202012/01 has been detected in 7 additional countries, variant 501Y.V2 in 5 additional countries, and variant P.1 in 4 additional countries. As of 11 May [2021], a total 149 countries have reported VOC 202012/01 (Figure 4), 102 countries variant 501Y.V2 (Figure 5), and 60 countries variant P.1 (Figure 6) - see also Annex 2. The information presented here should be interpreted with due consideration of surveillance limitations, including differences in sequencing capacities and prioritization of samples for sequencing between countries.

Vaccine performance against VOCs
-----------------------------------
Available evidence on vaccine performance against VOCs has been highlighted in previous editions of the Weekly Epidemiological Update, most recently 27 Apr [2021], and is summarised in Table 4.

Since the update on 27 Apr [2021], 2 studies from Israel and another from Qatar offer further evidence that Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty vaccine provides similar protection against B.1.1.7 disease as that reported in clinical trials. Both studies from Israel (one published and one preprint) used national surveillance data and found high vaccine effectiveness after the 2nd dose. The published study estimated a vaccine effectiveness of 98.1% (95% CI: 97.6-98.5), 98.0% (97.7-98.3), 97.7% (97.5-97.9), 96.5% (96.3-96.8), and 93.8% (93.3-94.2) against death, hospitalization, symptomatic disease, infection, and asymptomatic infection greater than or equal to 14 days post-2nd dose, respectively, in a setting where B.1.1.7 accounted for 95% of documented SARS-CoV-2 cases. The preprint from Israel reported similar findings.

In addition, the study from Qatar reports effectiveness of the vaccine to be 89.5% (95% CI: 85.9-92.3) against documented B.1.1.7 infection and 100% (95% CI: 81.7-100.0) against documented B.1.1.7 severe disease greater than or equal to 14 days post 2nd dose.3 The study also evaluated effectiveness of the Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty vaccine against B.1351-specific disease, finding somewhat reduced effectiveness of 75.0% (70.5-78.9%) against B.1.351 infection greater than or equal to 14 days post 2nd dose. However, effectiveness against B.1.351 severe disease greater than or equal to 14 days post 2nd dose was retained: 100% (73.7-100.0).

A study from the United States of America conducted during a period when B.1.1.7 was circulating found that the Janssen - Ad26.COV 2.5 vaccine was 76.7% (95%CI: 30.3-95.3) effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection, similar to clinical trial efficacy findings conducted in a non-B.1.1.7 setting. While this estimate is an average estimate across all circulating viruses during the study, B.1.1.7 was the most predominant variant in the region represented by the vast majority of participants (B.1.1.7 ranged from approximately 25-70% of sequenced viruses reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the study period in this region).

WHO recommendations
---------------------------
Virus evolution is an expected phenomenon, and the more SARS-CoV-2 circulates, the more opportunities it has to evolve. Reducing transmission through established and proven disease control methods such as those outlined in the COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, as well as avoiding introductions into animal populations, are crucial aspects of the global strategy to reduce the occurrence of mutations that have negative public health implications. PHSM remain critical to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Evidence from multiple countries with extensive transmission of VOCs has indicated that the PHSM, including infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in health facilities, has been effective in reducing COVID-19 case incidence, which has led to a reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among COVID-19 patients. National and local authorities are encouraged to continue strengthening existing PHSM, IPC, and disease control activities. Authorities are also encouraged to strengthen surveillance and sequencing capacities and apply a systematic approach to provide a representative indication of the extent of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants based on the local context, and to detect unusual events.

[In the past 24 hours, India (348 499), Brazil (71 018), the USA (34 807), and Argentina (25 976) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 13 652 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 9 May 2021 to late 10 May 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (9 countries) include India, Brazil, the USA, Argentina, France (19 791), Iran (18 133), Colombia (16 425), Turkey (14 497), and Sweden (13 812). A total of 52 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 25 of the 52 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 4 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 6.5%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 4.3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 21.6% decrease in daily reported cases and 3.6% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 700 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 160.32 million cumulative reported cases and over 3.33 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
