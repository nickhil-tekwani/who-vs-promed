Rumours have been received in National Malaria Program in Dominican Republic
on a suposed case of malaria in a Chilean pregnant tourist who have recently
visited Dominican Republic.
According to Malaria Program they have been unsuccesfully tried to contact
national authorities of Chile directly and through PAHO/WHO in order to
obtain clinical and epidemiological information on this possible case. These
are necessary for local epidemiological investigation and possible control
measures, and also to give to clinicians in charge of the case the necessary
information, based on Dominican experience, for clinical decitions.
Malaria program have asked us to use any way to contact Chilean professionals
related to this possible case (if these rumours are true).
This is a request for any person who is able to contact clinicians and
epidemiologists in charge of this probable case to give them these
information as soon as possible.
The agent of malaria in Dominican Republic is _Plasmodium falciparum_. Only
in imported cases have been found other species. Around 1,000 endemic cases
of malaria are reported every year countrywide in Dominican Republic.
Epidemiological pattern is basically of small clustered outbreacks linked to
migrant workers when and were new construction or crops claim huge number of
them. Usually in rural or demyrural areas. Not in resorts or tourist
complexes.
_P. falciparum_ in Dominican Republic is susceptible (non-resistant) to
cloroquine. Resistance have not been yet detected (except one case imported
from Africa). So, every case is treated with cloroquine and primaquine (not
primaquine in pregnant). According to national experience there is a smaller
risk in pregnant women using cloroquine than if not using it.
It is very urgent for Dominican authorities to have information on dates and
places visited (hotels and other places and communities). This information
is crucial because no cases have been reported in several years related to
tourist facilities. It is probable that other places out of the resorts were
visited and it is very important to identified and evaluate these places.

He will be very glad to exchange information and experiences with Chilean
doctors in charge of the case[, if there is such a case].
