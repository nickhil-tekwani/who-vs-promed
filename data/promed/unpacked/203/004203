[The 3 new fatal cases mentioned in the report above bring the total to 6 for Sindh province, mainly Karachi. The information from other provinces is not available. Surveillance initiatives aimed at early detection and management of suspected cases, along with vector mapping as well as travel and occupational exposure hazards must be incorporated in order to control this endemic public health problem, particularly in view of the upcoming Eid ul-Azha, which entails large movements of livestock across the country. - Mod.UBA
