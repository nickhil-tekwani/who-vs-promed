At least 165 people have died of meningitis and over 2000 were taken ill
with the contagious disease in north eastern India bordering Bangladesh and
Myanmar over the past one month, the local Indo-Asian News Service said on
Tuesday [10 Feb 2009].

The epidemic has taken place in the states of Meghalaya, Tripura, and
Mizoram, with Meghalaya reporting 140 death cases, said the report. The 3
north eastern states have borders with the Chittagong Hill Tracts of
Bangladesh, where meningococcal meningitis is spreading in an epidemic
form, the report quoted the National Institute of Communicable Diseases as
saying. Two doctors from New Delhi have been dispatched by the authorities
to the disease-stricken areas in Meghalaya to help doctors deal with the
disease on a through vaccinations and treatment on a round-the-clock basis,
said the report.

[The outbreak of meningococcal meningitis in the Indian state of Meghalaya
this year (2009) was recently reported by ProMED-mail (Meningitis,
meningococcal - India: (ML) 20090117.0206). At that time the outbreak was
said to have claimed 132 lives "according to the health department.
However, unconfirmed reports put the death toll much higher."

From the news report above, the number of deaths in Meghalaya has
increased slightly to 140, but the outbreak has now been reported to have
spread to neighboring Indian states of Tripura and Mizoram, and the
Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh, which borders Mizoram. The serogroup
of _Neisseria meningitidis_ is still not specified.

From Mod.ML's comments in the prior ProMED-mail post (Meningitis,
meningococcal - India: (ML) 20090117.0206): "In April 2008 a meningococcal
meningitis outbreak in Meghalaya] involved 300 cases with 30 deaths
(<http://www.shillongonline.com/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1446>).
In an undated article from the same website
(<http://www.theshillongtimes.com/shillong.html>), the state Health
Department was said to be "considering the option of mass vaccination to
control this disease, but added that it would involve huge financial
implications and manpower. In view of limited supply of vaccines in the
market, the government may provide vaccines only to the age group that has
been worst affected by meningococcal meningitis. 'So far, preventive
medicines [chemoprophylaxis] have been provided only to those families
having one of its members infected with the virus. To a certain extent,
preventive medicines have also been provided in a number of schools,'
sources said.""

Meghalaya, a mountainous Indian state, is located between the north eastern
border of Bangladesh and the Indian state of Assam. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail
interactive map of India that shows the states of Meghalaya, Tripura, and
Mizoram can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/en?v=22.9,79.6,5>. A
