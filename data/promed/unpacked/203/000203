Speaking at the launch of theileria vaccine pilot vaccination programme in Rusape's Makoni district [Manicaland province] on Tuesday [6 Dec 2022], [Agriculture deputy minister, Vangelis] Haritatos, said farmers should intensively dip their cattle to avoid the spread of tick-borne diseases.

"More than 65% of cattle deaths in Zimbabwe are due to tick-borne diseases (TBDs), including theileriosis ('January disease'). More than 500 000 cattle valued at more than USD 150 million died due to January Disease from 2018 to 2022," Haritatos said.

"So this pilot vaccination programme will Be spread to all theileriosis-affected provinces targeting at least 2 of the most affected districts per province and 2 dip tanks from each of the selected districts."

The disease, which has a fatality rate of up to 90%, is most common between December and March.

Haritatos said the country had produced 20 460 doses of theileria vaccines to curb the disease.

"This means that Zimbabwe now has the ability to locally produce 3 vaccines out of 4 major TBDs, which will save a considerable amount of foreign currency. What remains is to scale up the production levels to a commercial level," he said.

"While dipping remains the most cost-effective method of controlling ticks and tick-borne diseases, there are many other ways of supplementing the dipping programme such as the use of tick-borne disease vaccines, tick grease application, the use of TBD vaccines, acaricide resistance monitoring, dip wash strength monitoring, spatial tick distribution, dip tank rehabilitation, and construction of new dip-tanks and intensive dipping regime in January Disease hotspots."

[Theileriosis, caused by the _Theileria parva_ group is a WOAH reportable, protozoan cattle disease, endemic in 13 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In Zimbabwe the disease is known as January disease, occurring over the winter months, due to the tick's lifecycle. For WOAH's disease card Theileriosis, please go to https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/THEILERIOSIS.pdf.

ProMED has forwarded the report above to a theileria specialist, asking for a view on the high death statistics and the expectations from the vaccine use. We are grateful to Prof Eugene Pipano (Koret School of Veterinary Medicine, retired) for his kind response:

"The cattle population in Zimbabwe is estimated to be -- according to data available on the Internet -- between 4-5 million. This means that 2% to 2.5% of the cattle in Zimbabwe die every year from theileriosis. Considering the high mortality caused by this disease, an annual death of 100 000 heads of cattle does not seem impossible.

"The vaccination of cattle in Zimbabwe against _Theileria parva_ strains is traditionally based on the 'infection and treatment' method (ITM). The vaccine is manufactured from crushed _Rhipicephalus appendiculatus_ ticks that had been infected in the laboratory and carry virulent natural sporozoites. After calibrating, the stabilate is kept frozen. Following the injection with the thawed stabilate, the injected cattle receive treatment with tetracyclines during the incubation period of the disease, to minimize their post-vaccination clinical response. This is a laborious method which requires meticulous, close clinical follow-up during the post-vaccination period."

Given the above, it is expected that vaccination will help prevent the disease in a selected segment of the cattle population, such as dairy farms and animals of the most susceptible breeds. It does not seem that the vaccination of cattle will play a decisive role in controlling the disease nationwide. - Mod.AS
