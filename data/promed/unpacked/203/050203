A herd of mink is being slaughtered at a farm in North Jutland after several of the animals and one employee tested positive for coronavirus. Nicholas Kuhn Hove, the head of emergency preparedness at the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration said in a press statement that samples from the animals had been sent to be tested at Denmark's infectious diseases agency (SSI; Statens Serum Institut) over the weekend [13-14 Jun 2020], after some of the animals displayed symptoms.

At the same time, the farm was immediately quarantined. "When there was a suspicion of infection among the minks over the weekend, we placed immediate restrictions on the mink farm," he said. "No animals, and only a few employees, were able to go in and out."

According to Reuters, 11 000 animals at the farm will now be slaughtered under the precautionary principle. These are the 1st recorded cases of coronavirus infection at a Danish mink farm, although 2 mink farms in The Netherlands had animals test positive in April [2020].

In a press statement, the Danish mink breeders' association, said that they believed that the mink must have been infected by a human who had contracted the virus. "The infection was probably carried into the farm by the owner or an employee," they wrote. "Danish mink breeders are in close dialogue with the authorities and have been so since the 1st Dutch case in mid-April [2020].

According to TV2 Nord, a person associated with the farm has also tested positive. According to the Veterinary and Food Administration, animals do not play a significant role in the spread of coronavirus. "There is still no indication that pets play a role in the spread of COVID-19 to humans," a spokesperson told TV2.

[Denmark is regarded the world's top mink producer, said to produce 40 per cent of the world's pelts, with estimated fur and mink skins export of about EUR 0.5 billion [about USD 561 million] annually.

In the Netherlands, the number of SARS-CoV-2 infected (and culled) mink farms has increased to 15; the 2 last added outbreaks were reported to the House of Representatives in a letter from the Agriculture minister dated 15 Jun 2020; see https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/kamerstukken/2020/06/15/kamerbrief-stand-van-zaken-covid-19-en-nertsen (in Dutch).

In the Netherlands, 2 people were identified as infected from minks, leading to the severe veterinary measures applied, including culling and movement restrictions.

A government-supported study in the Netherlands includes tests in cats to establish or exclude their potential role in the epidemiology of the disease in and between mink farms. The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV) asked for research into (virus) transmission in cats by collaborating research groups within the Netherlands Centre for One Health (Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the University Utrecht, Wageningen University & Research, Erasmus MC and research centres in human health care). - Mod.AS
