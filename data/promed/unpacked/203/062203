Japanese Encephalitis "Warning," not "Alert," Issued by Korean NIH
------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in the press report posted as "Japanese encephalitis -
South Korea (Pusan): alert 20010514.0939" is misleading. No Japanese
encephalitis virus (JEV) was isolated from the JEV vector, _Culex
tritaeniorhynchus_, during this period.
The vector apparently [made up a larger proportion of the trapped
mosquitoes than normal. When populations of the JEV vector exceed 50% of
the total catch, the Korean National Institute of Health (NIH) issues a
Japanese encephalitis "warning." When virus isolations are made, the Korean
NIH issues a Japanese encephalitis "alert." There is apparently some
miscommunication in the translation of the text.

Presence of JEV Vector, Not JEV, Confirmed
------------------------------------------
We [reported identification of the mosquito species _Culex
tritaeniorhynchus_, which is the primary vector of Japanese encephalitis
virus (JEV) in South Korea. However, none of these mosquitos (15 in number)
was JEV-positive. We confirmed only the presence of the JEV vector among
mosquito collections, not the presence of the virus.
