Avian influenza A (H5N1) virus antibodies in pigs and residents of swine farms, southern China. By: Nan Cao and 11 others, published online 14 Nov 2013.

Abstract
----------
Background
Since 1997, the H5 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) circulating in China have become an international concern. Clade 2.3.2 of H5N1 avian influenza viruses are genetically distinct from the viruses isolated before 2007 and antigenically different from the [veterinary] vaccine strains widely used in China. Swine farms in rural China are thought to play an important role in the ecology of avian influenza viruses.

Objectives
A seroepidemiological study was undertaken among swine farm residents and pigs to understand the prevalence of antibodies against H5N1 avian influenza viruses in southern China.

Study design
During the period 24 Mar 2008 to 25 Dec 2012, serum samples were collected from 1606 swine farm residents on 40 swine farms in southern China. A total of 1980 pigs' serum samples were collected in the same swine farms where swine workers' serum samples were collected from March 2009 to March 2013. For a control group, 104 serum samples were collected from healthy city residents in Nanchang. All the serum samples were collected to perform hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and (neutralization) NT assays to investigate the prevalence of H5N1 avian influenza virus infections in southern China.

Results
16 human samples were positive by hemagglutination test assay, and 10 of these were also positive by neutralisation test assay against H5N1. No serum samples from human controls and pigs were positive for H5N1 avian influenza virus by hemagglutination assay.

Discussion
Our results demonstrate minimal transmission of H5N1 avian influenza viruses from birds to pigs in the swine farms studied in this investigation, and the risk of poultry-to-human and poultry-to-pig transmission for at least clades 2.3.2 [viruses] seemed very low. This study provides the 1st data regarding antibodies against H5N1 avian influenza viruses in humans and pigs on swine farms in China.

The findings of this study can serve as a baseline for additional serologic studies to assess transmission of H5N1 viruses between avian species, pigs and swine workers.

[Since the 1st confirmed human cases of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection were detected in 2003, there have been a total of 641 cases reported in 15 countries with 380 fatalities (as of 8 Oct 2013; see http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/EN_GIP_20131008CumulativeNumberH5N1cases.pdf). Of these cases, 45 (with 30 fatalities) occurred in China. By 2013, with increased awareness of the potential risk for the human population, the global total of human cases of H5N1 virus infection had dwindled to 31 (only 2 of which occurred in China).

Throughout this period, there have been no unambiguous records of human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 avian virus. But supportive seroprevalence data have been lacking. The investigation by Nan Cao and colleagues described above provides seroprevalence data that indicate that the risk of poultry-to-human and, additionally, poultry-to-pig transmission of at least the clades 2.3.2 avian H5N1 viruses has so far been very low in southern China.

Only the situation in Cambodia, with 20 (mostly children) of the 31 cases recorded so far in 2013, may show a different pattern. - Mod.CP
