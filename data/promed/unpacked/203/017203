3 more people have died from an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease
that investigators confirmed yesterday, 21 Oct 2005, originated in
the cooling tower of a Toronto nursing home.
Toronto health officials said droplets were distributed into the air
by the cooling system on the roof of the Seven Oaks Home for the Aged
in the city's east end and then sucked into the ventilation system's
air intake.
"The bacteria causing the disease were spread through a very
vulnerable population of elderly residents with tragic results," Dr.
David McKeown, Toronto's medical officer of health, told a news conference.
"From what we know at this point, there's no evidence that the
cooling tower was not properly maintained."
The latest 3 people to die were all elderly residents of the home
with a median age of 90 and pre-existing health conditions, officials said.
Health officials ordered the cooling tower shut down 6 Oct 2005 when
the disease was detected, and McKeown said there's been no risk to
the public since that time.
"This outbreak stands as one of the most significant events on record
involving Legionnaires' disease and we will be very diligent in
reviewing our work and identifying important lessons learned."
A separate, independent review of the outbreak is also being
conducted by Dr. David Walker, who also chaired an expert panel on
Toronto's deadly SARS outbreak 2 years ago. Walker will evaluate the
city's response to the latest outbreak and determine whether lessons
learned from the 2003 SARS outbreak were applied.
So far, 20 people -- all of whom were elderly with underlying health
conditions -- have died as a result of the outbreak, which began late
in September 2005. All told, there have been 127 cases of disease,
including 67 residents, 30 staff and 26 visitors.
Another 4 people who live or work in close proximity to Seven Oaks
Home for the Aged have also contracted the disease, likely infected
by droplets that escaped the building through the cooling tower.

[In total, this outbreak was substantial, not only in overall numbers
but also in the number of deaths. It is always prudent to locate
outdoor air intake vents appropriately far away from exhaust systems
or anything that generates potentially infectious droplets. - Mod.LL]
