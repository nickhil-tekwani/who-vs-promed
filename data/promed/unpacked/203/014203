A tense calm now hangs over the community of Granville in St. James
[Jamaica] and its environs where residents are expressing fear about
an outbreak of leptospirosis. Their fears were heightened on
Wednesday morning [23 Jan 2008] when a student of the Irwin High
School was hospitalized with symptoms of the disease, and later
succumbed to her ailment. Two other students have reportedly been
hospitalized with similar symptoms. However the Western Regional
Health Authority says there is still no confirmation that the
15-year-old student [who died] had the disease. It notes that the
results from tests carried out are still out.
In the meantime, the child's guardian who was obviously distraught
says she cannot understand why it took so long for the results to be
turned in so that [she] could begin getting treatment.
In recent weeks residents have been fearing outbreaks of
leptospirosis due to the influx of rodents caused from a garbage
pile-up in some communities.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett
[Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by one of the many pathogenic
serotypes of the spirochete _Leptospira_. It is transmitted to humans
by exposure of abraded skin or mucous membranes to water or wet soil
(such as after flooding due to heavy rainfall) that has been
contaminated by urine from asymptomatic chronically infected animals,
especially rodents.
Suspected leptospirosis was previously reported in Jamaica in 2007
(see ProMED-mail post 20071016.3383). As pointed out in the news
release above, inadequate disposal of trash and debris can provide a
suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings.
The current news release does not characterize the clinical
manifestations or the diagnostic tests that are pending. Because the
clinical manifestations of leptospirosis can overlap those of other
infectious diseases, laboratory confirmation is necessary. As pointed
out by Dr Jan Clement in the recent ProMED-mail post 20071018.3409,
the serious, potentially life-threatening complications of
leptospirosis that include renal failure, liver disease, and
pneumonia can mimic the clinical manifestations of Seoul hantavirus
(SEOV) infection, which is also transmitted by rats. A follow-up
report of the confirmed diagnosis in the cases of suspected
leptospirosis that is occurring in Jamaica is anticipated. - Mod.ML
