16 Apr 2015 W. Africa: Ebola researchers take new look at risk of sexual transmission
http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/world/africa/ebola-researchers-take-new-look-at-risk-of-sexual-transmission.html
[Medical investigators are focused on 2 women who died of Ebola in March 2015 -- 1 in Liberia and 1 in Sierra Leone. There were no known risk factors. However, their male partners had survived Ebola in 2014, suggesting that the virus could be active in semen longer than researchers had previously believed, and that it was transmissible through sexual activity. Recently American and Liberian scientists have found genomic evidence which may support sexual contact as the cause of the Liberian case]
[The confirmation of sexual transmission of Ebola in these cases may be resolved by genetic homogeneity between the viral genomes from the women and their respective partners. Sexual transmission of Ebola virus has been suggested by circumstantial evidence, but never with 100 percent certainty. Because the testes are protected from antibody, the virus could possibly replicate there beyond the viremic phase, and be transmitted without being neutralized by antibody. It is important to follow-up on these cases to determine the probability of sexual transmission so that there is better understanding of the risk factors for Ebola transmission. But most likely sexual transmission is a rare event that can be observed during large outbreaks. Thorough epidemiologic studies and genetic analyses should clarify this 1 way or the other, but because of the sensitivity of the topic, this will no doubt be difficult. - Mod.LK]
