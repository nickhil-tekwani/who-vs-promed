Infectious Laryngotracheitis (ILT) in Trinidad and Tobago
-----------------------------------------
The e-mail below is sent in response to your request for information
on the posting on avian flu in Trinidad and Tobago:
On 26 Feb 2004, a press release from the Trinidad and Tobago Ministry
of Agriculture, Land and Marine Resources informed that post mortem
examinations on birds from the Noonoo farm showed lesions suggestive
of Infectious Laryngotracheitis (ILT). There were no lesions
suggestive of Avian Influenza (Bird Flu). Samples were sent to the
Veterinary Laboratories Agency in England from where telephone
reports in mid-February eliminated Avian Influenza, and at a later
date, ILT was confirmed. This is the first time that the disease has
been found in Trinidad and Tobago, and there is now officially an
outbreak of ILT on the said farm. Specific conditions and procedures
are enforced, and a section of the legislation provided for a police
presence to ensure compliance has been invoked.
As of 2 Mar 2004, ILT appears to be confined to the one poultry farm
in Trinidad and Tobago. More detailed information on ILT can be
found in a CAREC Alert dated 27 Feb 2004 on the CAREC website:

[Dr Boisson's clear first-hand information is gratefully acknowledged.
ILT is an OIE list B disease which can be found in most commercial
poultry-raising countries but -- according to OIE's Handistatus data
-- is absent from a significant number of islands, such as Vanuato,
French Polynesia, Guernsey, Saint Kitts & Nevis, Seychelles, Saint
Vincent & the Grenadines, and others. It would be interesting to
search for its route of introduction into Trinidad & Tobago. - Mod.AS]
