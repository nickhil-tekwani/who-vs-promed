In Los Santos province last Tuesday [19 May 2009], 2 women died,
victims of a hantavirus [infection] said the National Epidemic
Department chief of the Ministry of Health, Gladys Guerrero. The
Health Regional director of Los Santos, Dulio Taylor said that a test
confirmed that both women had a hantavirus [infection], but samples
are going to be sent to the Gorgas Institute which 1st discovered the
virus, to find out the cause of death.

In the first 5 months of 2009 there have been 18 confirmed cases of
hantavirus [infection] in Los Santos province. Although the majority
cases of the cases come from the Azuero region, there has been one
case in Chepo. The Ministry of Health has carried out fumigation
programs to stop the propagation of rodents, but they continue to
proliferate especially in areas where there is accumulation of rubbish.

Rats are carriers of the hantavirus[es] and contaminate bottles and
other items with their urine.

[There were 2 deaths suspected to be caused by an unspecified
hantavirus infection in late December 2008 in this same region,
apparently followed by an additional 18 cases since the beginning of
this year (2009). The total number of deaths due to a hantavirus
infection is not given. Although this and the previous report (ProMED
archive number 20090103.0026) do not indicate which hantaviruses were
the etiological agents involved in these cases, they were most likely
Choclo virus. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number
20081027.3389, hantaviruses (and their rodent hosts) recognized in
Panama include Rio Segundo (_Reithrodontomys mexicanus_), Choclo
(_Oligoryzomys fulvescens (costaricensis)_), and Calabazo
(_Zygodontomys brevicauda (cherriei)_). Of these 3 viruses, only
Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.
