A recent report highlighted the apparent long-standing use of amoxicillin injection into orange trees 3 to 4 times a year to treat Citrus greening disease, caused by bacteria spread by psyllid insects. Amoxicillin -- reportedly used widely in northern and central orange orchards -- could lead to drug resistance or even fatal allergies in humans as well as contaminating the environment, especially water sources.

[A pharmacist] said his colleagues had identified the issue of antibiotic use in fruit and vegetable farming in the North.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Department of Medical Sciences have begun to investigate the jurisdictions involved. FDA has required respective provincial health offices to check on orange orchards for the distribution of amoxicillin to farmers.

[Greening is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruit. It is caused by fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacteria classified as _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus (CaLas; Asian greening; huanglongbing), africanus (including a subsp. capensis; African greening) or americanus (South American greening). The 3 pathogens can only be distinguished by molecular methods. For the report above, CaLas seems to be the most likely pathogen.

Symptoms include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves, as well as small, irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel and bad taste. Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient deficiencies. Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers and may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit. The diseases are restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of their psyllid vectors. The pathogens can also be spread by grafting and possibly by seed from infected plants or transovarially in the vectors. Both, pathogens and vectors, can be spread with plant material.

Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control in orchards, and biological control of vectors in non-crop reservoirs. Control using cultural methods, such as interplanting with non-host crops, is being trialled. In areas where a pathogen has not yet been detected, biological control of vectors has been used successfully to reduce insect numbers and, therefore, the risk of greening outbreaks (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20090601.2034).

Several phytoplasma species have been reported to cause similar symptoms in citrus and coinfections of phytoplasmas with CaLas have also been reported (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20180214.5629251). Further research is needed on symptomatology, epidemiology and host impact of both single and mixed infections of these pathogens.

Antibacterial leaf sprays and seed treatments containing antibiotics may be useful in agriculture, but are subject to strict regulations in most countries due to their associated risks of facilitating the emergence of antibiotic resistances in other crop, animal and human pathogens. Furthermore, residues of antibiotics may lead to rejection of exported produce by some countries.

Trunk injections are used to suppress symptoms of some bacterial, phytoplasma and even fungal tree diseases (see, for example, ProMED-mail posts 20180914.6028738, 20160404.4137142, 20080125.0313). They are costly and labour intensive, usually have to be commenced before symptoms become obvious, and they have to be repeated regularly. Furthermore, particularly in dicot species, it is difficult to achieve an even distribution of the injected compound over the whole of the tree. They do not provide a cure, but may be useful to keep individual, valuable trees alive by limiting the number of pathogens present in the plant's tissues. However, they are not generally considered suitable for large scale production systems like orchards, and therefore it seems surprising that the farmers in the report above have resorted to this method.
