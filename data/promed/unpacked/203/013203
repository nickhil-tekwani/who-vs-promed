HK researchers announce diagnostic test for SARS; confirm virus source
----------------------------------
HONG KONG (AFX) - University of Hong Kong reseachers announced that they
have developed a diagnostic test to rapidly identify victims of an atypical
pneumonia which has killed some 50 people around the world.
In a statement, the Department of Microbiology of the Faculty of Medicine
of the University of Hong Kong also said it has confirmed previous findings
that the global outbreak of atypical pneumonia was caused by the Coronavirus.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said earlier this
week that the virus causing the global outbreak of atypical pneumonia, or
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), was from the Coronavirus group.
In their statement, the University of Hong Kong researchers said they have
"confirmed that the recent outbreak of pneumonia is caused by the virus
known as Coronavirus.
"The discovery of the agent is an important international research
breakthrough," they said, adding that the disease should be referred to as
Coronavirus Pneumonia, or CVP.
They said the diagnostic test they have developed "will enable early and
reliable diagnosies of CVP and hence early treatment of the disease.
"The early phase diagnostic test helps infection control by identifying
which contacts have or have not acquired CVP and ensure discharged patients
will not infect the community," they added.
The diagnostic test will be available at hospitals here starting tomorrow,
the researchers told at a press conference.
Yuen Kwok-yung, head of microbiology at the faculty of medicine, said the
virus is mainly transmitted by contact.
"Your hands are the greatest enemy," Yuen said, adding that the virus can
only survive in the air for some three hours.
There have been more than 50 deaths and more than 1300 reported cases of
SARS worldwide with the majority of the fatalities occurring in China. The
disease has claimed 10 lives Hong Kong, 4 in Vietnam and 3 in Canada.

HONG KONG The government imposed quarantine measures Thursday to impede the
spread of an epidemic of deadly pneumonia as scientists announced a
breakthrough in testing patients for the mysterious virus. Hong Kong, the
transportation hub from which the disease apparently spread worldwide,
announced the immediate quarantine of more than 1000 residents suspected of
infection and shut down schools for 1 million students. ''Hong Kong faces
an epidemic that the world has never seen before,'' said Tung Chee-hwa, the
territory's chief executive. ''This is a very, very serious issue.''
Hong Kong has been battling a wildfire the rapid spread of the disease for
2 weeks. The quarantine announced Friday applies to 1080 people who had
close contact with those infected by the disease. Nearly 1000 other people
who had social contact with infected patients will undergo
surveillance. Penalties for breaking domestic quarantine include a fine of
5000 Hong Kong dollars (about USD 640) , obligatory confinement and 6
months in prison. The Hong Kong measures came a day after Singapore
undertook similar moves. Singapore, by contrast, cancelled all schools and
instituted draconian quarantine measures shortly after the first sign of
infection appeared.
''We are favor of any measure within the law that will contain a disease
outbreak,'' said Peter Cordingley, a spokesman for the World Health
Organization. ''We don't have any problem with Singapore's approach.''
The most secretive least forthcoming country, however, has been China,
which on Wednesday acknowledged the presence of the atypical pneumonia for
the first time, announcing the highest number of infected patients and
fatalities in the world. The Chinese authorities also said the situation
was ''basically under control,'' hoping to avert the panic that took place
several months ago over outbreak of pneumonia now thought to be linked to
the current crisis.
Popular worries were evident throughout Hong Kong on Thursday as a growing
proportion of the public put on face masks while walking in public areas.
Researchers at the University of Hong Kong announced successful DNA
sequencing of a virus that they say causes the disease. The finding, if
confirmed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, could
allow creation of a rapid diagnostic test and reduce death rates by
allowing doctors to identify affected patients sooner.
The illness, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, has killed at
least 53 people, mostly in Asia, and infected 1300 in more than a dozen
countries. The group of microbiologists from the University of Hong Kong
identified the virus as a new strain from the family of coronaviruses,
highly contagious viruses that are the second leading cause of colds in humans.
''The coronavirus is the primary cause of the disease,'' said Malik Peiris,
a professor of microbiology, adding that another virus, of the family that
causes mumps, may also be involved and increase the severity of the
disease. Peiris said the new strain had characteristics unlike any other he
had ever seen.
''This is unlike any other human or animal virus ever described before,''
he said, adding that humans may not necessarily develop immunity to such a
virus after recovering from an infection.
''If we find they behave like a cold, you can get the same cold again and
again,'' Peiris said, warning that transmission of such a virus occurs
through droplets and can take place in many common public areas.
''Railings, lift buttons and just about anything touched by a person with
an infection can pass on the virus,'' he said.
To avoid infection, he warned people to wash their hands frequently, avoid
touching the eyes, mouth or nose and wipe down with rubbing alcohol. ''The
virus is easily killed with rubbing alcohol,'' Peiris said. ''Wear a mask
if you want, but make sure not to touch your face with your hands when
adjusting it.''
Peiris said his findings supported the multiple drug treatment with
ribavirin and steroids currently administered to patients. The ribavirin
suppresses growth of the virus, while the steroids mitigate damage caused
by the body's own immune reaction.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Microbiologist Bernhard Fleischer, head of Hamburg's
Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNI), said his institute
had probably identified the virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS).
"I don't assume that there will be a worldwide epidemic which will spread
among the population," Fleischer told Reuters in an interview. "We are
lucky that this disease is not as contagious and does not spread as easily
as first assumed."
Scientists from the BNI, Germany's top tropical diseases institute, worked
on identifying the virus by analyzing tissue samples taken from a doctor
from Singapore who was being treated in Frankfurt after showing symptoms of
SARS. Fleischer said his institute had developed a test with which experts
could detect within one or two hours whether a patient had caught the virus.
A group of microbiologists from the University of Hong Kong said on
Thursday they had also identified a virus and believe it is a new strain
from the family of coronaviruses, the second-leading cause of colds in
humans. The finding is consistent with tests conducted by the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.
Coronaviruses, so named because they have a crown-like appearance when seen
under a microscope, are often responsible for upper respiratory infections
in premature infants.
Fleischer said he believed it is spread through droplets by sneezing and
coughing and therefore can only be caught through very close contact with
an infected person. "I expect it to abate in the next few weeks," he
added. Fleischer also said he believed the disease was not very contagious
before a patient started to show symptoms, such as high fever and shortness
of breath. Other viruses are highly contagious from the moment of infection.
Developing a serum against SARS could take years, Fleischer said, but he
added that a new vaccination may not be necessary as known medications
against viruses could help to combat it. "It first needs to be examined
whether known and existing medication can help," he said. The Hong Kong
research team said patients were responding well to a cocktail of
anti-viral drugs and steroids.
Fleischer said his institute and U.S. scientists had independently found
that the cause of SARS was probably a coronavirus. It had probably been
transmitted from animals to human beings, he said. However, other labs that
analyzed samples from patients had said they found what looked like a new
kind of paramyxovirus, which causes measles and respiratory disease in babies.

[Hong Kong is the third location with documented local transmission of SARS
to implement quarantine measures for known contacts of SARS cases
(Singapore and Ontario Canada have implemented similar quarantines). In
addition, Hong Kong and Singapore have closed schools in an attempt to
reduce situations of close contact that might enhance transmission.
The multiple press releases related to the identification of a coronavirus
continue to be promising, (especially if there has been genetic sequencing
of the virus), yet again caution needs to be exerted until further
confirmation that this agent is in fact the etiologic agent of
SARS. (Remembering that last week 3 independent laboratories identified a
paramyxovirus from specimens taken from SARS patients). It is also
premature to conclude that infection with this agent does not lead to the
production of protective antibodies as is suggested in one of the newswires
above. There are many questions that remain to be answered before
definitive conclusions can be drawn and more detailed specific
recommendations can be made. - Mod.MPP]
[Two of the laboratories that originally suggested that SARS was associated
with infection by an unspecified paramyxovirus have now come into line with
the CDC verdict that the etiologic agent has the characteristics of a
member of the genus _Coronavirus_ of the family _Coronaviridae_. A
consensus seems to be appearing. Until the full details of the scientific
evidence become available, however, the final verdict will remain in doubt
in view of the earlier contrary reports from Canada that the recently
characterized human metapneumovirus may be the etiologic agent. Some of the
information in these press reports, such as the statement that: "The new
strain had characteristics unlike any other he (Professor Peiris) had ever
seen", are not interpretable at this stage. - Mod.CP]
