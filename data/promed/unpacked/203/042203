UK Government: Outbreak of Spring Viraemia of Carp
-------------------------------------
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)
has confirmed an outbreak of Spring Viraemia of Carp (SVC), a
contagious viral disease of fish, in koi carp at a private residence in
Ipswich, Suffolk.
This outbreak has no implications for human health.
SVC is a notifiable disease under the Diseases of Fish Act 1937. It can
have a devastating effect on a number of fish species, and DEFRA has
made an Order prohibiting movements of fish to and from the affected
site.
DEFRA's fish health inspectors are also investigating the source of the
outbreak and tracing any fish which may have been in contact with the
fish at the infected site.
All those concerned with the import, keeping, farming or retailing of
carp and other susceptible fish should take strict precautions to prevent
the spread of SVC and follow the advice set out in DEFRA's advisory
booklet "Combating Fish Disease." Anyone noting deaths of carp or
any other species of fish susceptible to SVC should immediately
contact the Centre for Environment and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS),
Weymouth Laboratory.
1. The Diseases of Fish (Designated Areas) (England) Order 2001
which came into force on 14 June 2001 restricts the movement of any
live fish or live eggs of fish into or from the designated area without
the prior written consent of DEFRA. The designated area is as follows:
Hilton Road, Ipswich, Suffolk O.S. Ref. TM19304240
2. SVC is a contagious viral disease which affects common carp and its
ornamental varieties, as well as other species including goldfish, tench,
pike and Wels catfish. It often results in significant death rates. The
disease is widespread in continental Europe. In 1988 there was a major
outbreak in England and Wales with 40 sites affected. Prior to 1988
only 4 cases had been recorded in Great Britain. There were 2 isolated
cases in 1991, 22 in 1994, 14 in 1995, 3 cases in 1996, 7 cases in 1997, 4
cases in 1998 and 1 case in 1999.
3. The clinical signs of SVC can include darkening of the skin, swollen
eyes, abdominal swelling, pale gills, trailing fecal casts and protrusion
of the anus. Infected fish may be lethargic and show areas of bleeding
in the gills and skin.
