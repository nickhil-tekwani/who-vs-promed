[The following information has been received from Dr. Andrew Jeremijenko,
an Australian GP with an interest in the epidemiology of measles, who has
worked for 6 years in Indonesia. - Mod.CP]
The Jakarta Post reported, on Wed 3 Nov 2004, that a health official had
stated that 26 children under the age of 5 had died from a virulent measles
outbreak on the remote island of Alor, in East Nusa Tenggara, during the
past two weeks. "As small children lacked immunity, without treatment,
they could die after 3 days of exposure."
The Kupang Post reported, on Tue 2 Nov 2004, a "strange virus kills 26 Alor
children," and went on to say that 226 other people had been affected in
the villages. The diagnosis is not certain but is thought to be measles,
based on the description of the symptoms, including fever, cough, runny
nose, and a rash. However, the doctor stated that, if the children improve,
the symptoms are not similar to measles. "Namun setelah sembuh tidak ada
gejala pos morbiliti berupa bekas bintik-bintak hitam di kulit." I believe
this means that there are black lesions on the skin. Nusa Tenggara Timur
(NTT) is 90 percent Christian, and birds, pigs, and humans in these remote
islands often live in close proximity. Much of Indonesia is predominantly
Muslim, so pigs are not in close proximity with humans, so I believe it may
be beneficial to obtain further information about this outbreak.

[Dr. Jeremijenko comments that the severity of the illness is not unusual
for 3rd world measles. However, with the rapid deaths, and with some of the
symptoms mentioned, he would like to see this outbreak more thoroughly
investigated, and other possible diagnoses considered, such as (avian)
influenza or a hemorrhagic fever. Further information and clarification of
the diagnosis from informed sources in the region would be welcomed.

Indonesia: 26 children die in measles outbreak in Alor
-----------------------------------------------
26 children, all under 5 years old, have died from a virulent measles
outbreak on the remote island of Alor, in East Nusa Tenggara, during the
past 2 weeks, a health official says. More than 200 other children are sick
with the virus in the villages of East Mataru, Taman Mataru, and Kamafui,
with 4 in a critical condition, local health office head Paul S. Manumpil
told The Jakarta Post on Tuesday [2 Nov 2004]. He said late treatment was
the cause of the fatalities, which could have been prevented. "Most of them
were infected by the end of October 2004 but were not treated accordingly,"
Manumpil said.
Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by the
morbillivirus [i.e. _Measeles virus_, a member of the genus _Morbillivirus_
of the family _Paramyxoviridae_. - Mod.CP]. The disease is common among
children but also seen in older non-immune people. As small children lacked
immunity, without treatment they could die after 3 days of exposure,
Manumpil said.
To prevent the virus from spreading, medical workers had isolated the 3
villages. They were treating sick children with antibiotics, he said. State
Kalabahi Hospital director Yoseph Usen Uma said the children were unlikely
to have been vaccinated against the virus. "Had vaccination taken place
earlier, the impact of the outbreak would not have been that bad," he said.
In most children, measles vaccine is given [in the form of] the
mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) triple immunization. MMR is given twice during
childhood, at the age of 15 months and at 11 to 12 years old. Manumpil said
the virus was airborne and spread through the food and drink consumed by
the children. Alor Regent Ans Takalapeta has ordered medical workers in the
regency to give aid to the survivors. Symptoms of measles include fever, a
hacking cough, runny nose, and a red pimply rash over the body.
