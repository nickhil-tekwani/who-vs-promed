A rabid wolf attacked and bit 4 persons -- 2 men and 2 women -- during the
night of 1 Jan 2005, in the village Novokamenka (Velikooleksandrovsky
district, Kherson region). The mother of one of the men who was attacked
killed the animal. Remains of a dog, probably killed by the same wolf
earlier, were found in an adjacent street. Local residents stated that the
wolf had been seen during the same night in the vicinity of a cattle shed,
but no contacts could be established. The wolf's head was sent to the
regional Kherson veterinary bacteriological laboratory, where it tested
positive for rabies. The weight of the wolf was estimated to be 90 kg. The
remains of the dog and the body of the wolf have been burnt. All victims
were hospitalized in the central regional hospital of the
Velikoaleksandrovsky district, where postexposure rabies therapy is being
carried out.

[The above description has a certain deja-vu quality. One cannot avoid
recalling accounts of Louis Pasteur's attempts to treat and save Russian
peasants bitten by rabid wolves some 120 years ago. Fortunately, chances of
surviving such attacks have significantly improved since those pioneering
days. - Mod.AS]
