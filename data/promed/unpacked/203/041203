Egypt: new human H5N1 bird flu case detected
--------------------------------------------
Egypt has detected its first human case of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian
influenza virus since May [2006] in an Egyptian woman who raised ducks from
her home, a World Health Organization official said on Tuesday [10 Oct 2006].
Hassan el-Bushra, regional adviser for communicable diseases surveillance
at the World Health Organization, said the woman had tested positive for
the avian influenza virus in tests carried out by Egyptian health
authorities. The new infection brings the number of human cases in Egypt to
15, of whom 6 have died. All the previous infections were detected between
March and May 2006 after the virus first surfaced in Egyptian poultry in
February [2006].
The woman, 39 years old, of the Nile Delta province of Gharbiya, has been
in hospital since 4 Oct 2006 and has been treated with the drug Tamiflu
(oseltamivir), state news agency MENA said. The woman was on a respirator,
but her condition was stable, MENA said. Her family was being tested for
the virus.
Egypt has had the largest cluster [thatis, number of cases. - Mod.CP] of
human bird flu cases outside of Asia, and the fresh case came a month after
authorities found a cluster of new cases in birds following a 2 month lull
in detected poultry cases.
The initial bird flu outbreak caused panic in Egypt, where poultry is a
major source of protein and where poor families frequently breed chickens
domestically in cities and rural areas to supplement their diet and income.
MENA reported that the newly infected woman had raised a flock of 11 ducks
from her home north of the Egyptian capital. Two became sick and died, and
she then slaughtered the rest before she was hospitalized.
Most of the people infected with bird flu in Egypt became ill after coming
into contact with so-called "backyard" birds, officials say. Egypt has
culled 30 million birds since February 2006 to contain the virus. Chickens
on rooftops may be particularly susceptible to catching the virus from
infected migrant birds, which fly along the densely populated Nile valley
during migration, experts have suggested.
Bushra had earlier said that the fresh cases of bird flu in Egyptian
poultry showed that there was still a risk for human cases, but a large
outbreak was less likely to take hold or spread so long as Egypt continued
to vaccinate poultry. The vast majority of Egyptian commercial poultry
flocks have been vaccinated, while about 20 per cent of domestic birds had
received vaccines, officials say.
Two separate officials said the onset of warm weather, combined with
Egyptian government measures, may have helped keep the virus at bay during
the summer months. But an official from the Food and Agriculture
Organization has said that the onset of cooler weather could still cause a
flare-up of cases in poultry and has urged increased surveillance
accompanied by a fair compensation scheme.

Egypt: avian influenza situation - WHO update 9
-----------------------------------------------
As of Wed 11 Oct 2006, the Ministry of Health in Egypt has confirmed the
country's first case of human infection with the H5N1 virus since May of
this year [2006].
The patient is a 39 year old woman from the Gharbiya governorate in the
Nile Delta. She developed symptoms on 30 Sep 2006 and was admitted to
hospital on 4 Oct 2006. She subsequently developed pneumonia. She remains
in hospital in a stable condition.
Her recent history includes the home slaughter and defeathering of around a
dozen ducks, when signs of illness and deaths began to occur in the flock.
Egypt reported a recurrence of poultry outbreaks in backyard flocks in
September 2006. Previous human cases occurred from late March through May
2006. To date, the country has reported 15 cases, of which 6 were fatal.

Indonesian woman tested positive for bird flu virus infection
-------------------------------------------------------------
A 67 year old Indonesian woman being treated in hospital is positively
infected by avian influenza, a health official said on Wednesday [11 Oct
2006]. The woman had contact with fowl before she was admitted to hospital
on 7 Oct 2006 in the Hasan Sadikin hospital in Bandung, capital of West
Java province, said Joko Susilo, an official in charge at the anti-bird-flu
center here.
"The woman tested positive for avian influenza," Susilo told the Xinhua
News Agency. He said that the tests were carried out by the Health Ministry
Laboratory and NAMRU, the United States Naval Medical Research Unit based
in Jakarta. Indonesia has become one of the front lines in the fight
against the H5N1 virus.
So far, the country has recorded 52 deaths, surpassing Viet Nam, making
Indonesia the hardest hit country, according to the World Health
Organization. Altogether, 130 out the 146 human deaths caused by bird flu
have occurred in East Asia since 2003, according to the data from the World
Bank.
