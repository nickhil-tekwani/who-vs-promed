Epidemiological comments
31 Mar 2009: a National Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP) laboratory
reported seropositive results for avian influenza. The birds were
being tested as part of the NPIP Avian Influenza.

Clean Program (H5 and H7) for breeding facilities. No clinical signs,
other than a modest drop in egg production, were reported. There was
no increase in mortality.

1 Apr 2009: Enhanced surveillance at the broiler-breeding operation
was implemented, and additional laboratory samples were taken.

There were no clinical indications of disease at the time of
diagnostic testing.

2 Apr 2009: The National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL)
confirmed H7 RRT-PCR and hemagglutinin subtype as H7 positive.

Laboratory testing is continuing, but to date, no virus has been isolated.

Kentucky State animal health officials, in coordination with USDA
APHIS Veterinary Services, implemented the LPAI response plan in
accordance with the Kentucky Initial State Response and Containment
Plan for H5 and H7 LPAI.

Implementation included:
An enhanced surveillance zone of 10 km (6.2 miles) was implemented as
outlined in the plan. There are 4 farms, all breeder facilities and
all owned by the same company, within the 10-km radius of the
positive premises. Laboratory samples were collected and submitted
from all 4 farms. Surveillance of backyard poultry flocks is being
conduced within a 3-km (2-mile) radius of the premises.

4 Apr 2009: NVSL reported that sera tested by hemagglutination
inhibition test and neuraminidase inhibition test were seropositive
for H7N9

4 Apr 2009: As a precautionary measure, all birds in the 2 houses
were depopulated.

5 Apr 2009: All laboratory samples collected from the enhanced
surveillance on the 4 breeding facilities yielded negative laboratory
results for avian influenza.

Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: H5 and H7 avian
influenza in its low pathogenic form in poultry is a notifiable
disease as per Chapter 10.4. on avian influenza of the Terrestrial
Animal Health Code (2008).

Control measures:

Measures applied:
* Stamping out
* Quarantine
* Zoning
* Vaccination prohibited
* No treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied:
* Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)

[Note that not a single bird was sick; this "outbreak" was detected by
serological surveillance, and cost the company 20 000 broiler-breeders
culled.
