Last night [25 Apr 2014], the Minister of Health confirmed that chikungunya virus [CHKV] has expanded to other cities of the Dominican Republic other than the San Cristobal province, where [the outbreak] began, but not as outbreaks, rather as isolated cases. "We are seeing isolated areas with isolated infected people, but not as outbreaks. We have not had currently another outbreak like the one in San Cristobal," said Freddy Hidalgo.

He indicated that isolated chikungunya cases have appeared in Puerto Plata ad San Pedro, because these cities have people who have come from Nigua in San Crisobal [province]. "We expect that the virus can continue to move, but we continue working with the people in prevention tasks," he added. Freddy Hidalgo explained that to the extent that people move from one city to another, the virus can too, "but we are alert to contain new outbreaks." The official explained that when a person has become infected with the virus and goes from one place to another, there is risk that the person will be bitten by a mosquito that will then bite another person and infect them.

"The mosquito is present in different localities to which one might move, and because of this, we are working to avoid dissemination of the virus, that [in turn], moves with the [infected] people. We are not immune, nor is there a vaccine, so we are susceptible to being affected by the virus," he said.

He stressed to the public that water stored on the patios of their houses should be in containers previously treated with bleach. He also asked for general collaboration by the populace for the elimination of water catchments that could contain clean water from their patios.

[New cases are appearing in various parts of the Dominican Republic, especially on the south coast. The 25 Apr 2014 edition of Entorno Inteligente (http://www.entornointeligente.com/articulo/2421878/REPUBLICA-DOMINICANA-La-chikungunya-provoca-188-casos-por-dia-en-Nigua-25042014) quotes the Ministry of Public Health as stating that there are no outbreaks, just isolated cases, outside of the main focus of infection in Nigua, San Cristobal and Haina, where there is an average of 188 new cases per day. However, the 25 Apr 2014 edition of Sierra Vision (http://sierravision.com.do/alcanza-a-4-provincias-virus-de-chikungunya/) indicated that there are outbreaks of chikungunya virus infections in 4 provinces. The localities with the most cases are: San Pedro, Nigua, Haina and Boca Chica (which had 76 cases in the past 72 hours). The 25 Apr 2014 edition of Dominican Today (http://www.dominicantoday.com/dr/local/2014/4/25/51271/Public-Healths-cavalry-battles-chikungunya-fever-at-Boca-Chica) stated that the Public Health Ministry has deployed as of Friday [25 Apr 2014] its entire "cavalry" to fumigate Boca Chica, as the rising cases of chikungunya fever have panicked the resort town's population. Fumigation will have limited effect on transmission unless vector mosquito breeding sites are treated or eliminated. Barahona province has also had "dozens of suspected cases," according to a 26 Apr 2014 report in Al Momento (http://www.almomento.net/articulo/161688/BARAHONA-Casos-sospechosos-de-fiebre-Chikungunya), although the occurrence of suspected cases in Barahona is denied in another report (http://www.resumendesalud.com/do/index.php/categoria-infectologia/7893-en-algunas-localidades-no-se-han-registrado-casos-de-chikungunya). Ironically, there has been a cluster of cases in the Robert Reid Cabral Children's Hospital in Santo Domingo, where medical personnel, nurses and other public health workers have been affected. Apparently, _Aedes aegypti_ vector mosquitoes are breeding on the hospital grounds (http://www.alanterd.com/2014/04/salud-publica-se-rehusa-dar-total-casos.html and http://elnuevodiario.com.do/mobile/article.aspx?id=371961).

Less than 24 hours after St Vincent and the Grenadines confirmed an outbreak of the chikungunya virus, another Caribbean Community (CARICOM) country is reporting its 1st case of the mosquito-borne disease. Antigua and Barbuda health officials on Friday [25 Apr 2014] held a news conference to confirm that an individual in his mid 60s had become the island's 1st case.

Medical Officer of Health Dr Orita Zachariah told reporters that the case had been detected on 22 Apr [2014], and the victim, between the ages of 60 and 65, works in the capital, St John's.

The health authorities say they are also awaiting results of 4 other suspected cases from the Trinidad-based Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) [laboratories].

Dr Zachariah said that persons should remain home if they suspect they have the disease, while Chief health Inspector Lionel Michael said the Department of Health would increase vector control in a bid to prevent a spread of the disease.

On Thu 24 Apr 2014, the Ministry of Health in St Vincent and the Grenadines declared an outbreak of the virus after 3 cases were confirmed on the northern Grenadine island of Bequia.

[The 24 Apr 2014 edition of I-Witness News (http://www.iwnsvg.com/2014/04/24/update-health-minister-declares-outbreak-of-chikungunya-in-st-vincent/) indicated that cases of chikungunya on Bequia were 1st suspected last week, Mon 14 Apr 2014. Of the 4 samples sent to the Trinidad laboratory, 3 tested positive for chikungunya virus. An additional 14 samples are ready to send to the Trinidad Laboratory.

There are no new confirmed cases of chikungunya on the island; however, health officials suspect there may be at least 10 more. The Ministry of Health announced the 1st and only confirmed case of the disease earlier this month [April 2014].

Chief Epidemiologist Nahum Jn Baptiste told Saint Lucia News Online (SNO) in an interview that as of today, 23 Apr 2014, 10 suspected cases have surfaced -- one as recent as yesterday -- involving a foreigner, but none have been confirmed.

A 63-year-old fisherman, who was the 1st individual confirmed to have contracted the virus, has been treated and is fully recovered. He is now back on the job, Jn Baptiste said.

"So far, we have done the investigations. We have not yet confirmed any other case that has been transmitted from that imported case. We also have another suspected case of a foreigner, someone who started to present signs and symptoms yesterday [22 Apr 2014]," he said.

Jn Baptiste said the ministry continues to strengthen its surveillance system and will continue to send samples to the Caribbean Public Health Agency for testing every week.

Following the announcement of the 1st confirmed case of chikungunya [virus infection] a few weeks ago, the Ministry of Health said it had intensified mosquito-control efforts to lessen the impact of a chikungunya outbreak on the island. Officials say the impact of the disease all depends on whether suitable conditions exist for _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes to breed, since they transmit the disease [virus].

People suffering with the illness will mainly feel chronic pain in the joints, and although it will not require being admitted to a hospital, there will be prolonged pain or swelling in the joints.

"As long as we have an infected person and the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is around and they can bite this infected person whereupon they get infected themselves and then bite someone else, there is possibility for transmission. We of course are zooming in on our index case and looking at his surroundings and the persons in his household and places he frequents to ensure we have some focus intervention there as well," Chief Medical Officer Dr. Merlene Fredericks said.
