[2] WHO/PAHO: North and South America: epidemiological alert
Date: Wed 21 Nov 2018
Source: WHO/PAHO North and South America: Epidemiological Alert Dengue [edited]
https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/2018-Nov-21-phe-epi-alert-dengue.pdf


Following a period of low dengue transmission in the Region of the Americas, an increase in cases has been reported in some countries. With the start of high transmission season for dengue in the Southern Hemisphere, the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) recommends Member States implement preparedness and response actions in order to prevent transmission of dengue as well as deaths due to this disease.

Situation summary in the Americas
---------------------------------
In the Region of the Americas, between epidemiological week (EW) 1 and EW 44 of 2018, a total of 446 150 cases of dengue were reported (incidence of 45.9 cases per 100 000 population), including 240 deaths. Of the total cases, 171 123 were laboratory-confirmed and 2164 (0.49 percent) were classified as severe dengue.

As of EW 44 of 2018, 13 countries in the Americas reported an increase in cases nationally or in parts of the country (compared to the same period in 2017): Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Paraguay, and Venezuela. In Peru, though there was a decrease in the number of cases reported at the national level, an increase was observed (compared to 2017) in the departments of Loreto and Madre de Dios.

In 2018, the number of cases reported to date is similar to the total registered in 2017, and if this trend continues, it could exceed the total reported in that year (Figure 1).

Compared to previous years, the total number of cases reported by the end of 2017 (581 207) was less than that reported in 2016 (2 178 929) and the lowest in the past 10 years. However, the proportion of cases of severe dengue reported in 2017 was higher than the 2 previous years.

The 4 dengue virus serotypes (DENV 1, DENV 2, DENV 3, and DENV 4) are circulating simultaneously in some countries of the Region, which increases the risk of severe dengue, and therefore, could cause an additional burden on health services.

If timely interventions are not applied to control the vector, _Aedes aegypti_, an increase in cases could be expected in 2019; the magnitude of which will depend on the intensity and effectiveness of the control and prevention measures implemented.

[3] WHO: vaccine position paper
Date: Fri 7 Sep 2018

Dengue vaccine: WHO position paper - September 2018
---------------------------------------------------
The live attenuated dengue vaccine CYD-TDV has been shown in clinical trials to be efficacious and safe in persons who have had a dengue virus infection in the past (seropositive individuals), but carries an increased risk of severe dengue in those who experience their 1st natural dengue infection after vaccination (seronegative individuals). Countries should consider introduction of the dengue vaccine CYD-TDV only if the minimization of risk among seronegative individuals can be assured.

For countries considering vaccination as part of their dengue control programme, pre-vaccination screening is the recommended strategy. With this strategy, only persons with evidence of a past dengue infection would be vaccinated (based on an antibody test, or on a documented laboratory confirmed dengue infection in the past). If pre-vaccination screening is not feasible, vaccination without individual screening could be considered in areas with recent documentation of seroprevalence rates of at least 80% by age 9 years.

Screening tests would need to be highly specific to avoid vaccinating truly seronegative persons and to have high sensitivity to ensure that a high proportion of seropositive persons are vaccinated. Conventional serological testing for dengue virus IgG (e.g. dengue IgG ELISA) is available in most dengue endemic countries, and could be used to identify persons who have had a past dengue infection. However, such laboratory-based assays do not provide results at the point of care. Point- of-care tests, i.e. RDTs, would facilitate the implementation of the pre-vaccination screening strategy, but to date none have been validated or licensed specifically for the detection of past dengue infection. Use of currently available IgG-containing RDTs - despite their lower sensitivity for detection of past dengue infection compared with conventional dengue IgG ELISA - could be considered in high transmission settings until better RDTs for determining serostatus become available.

No screening test is likely to be 100% specific due to potential cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses. In settings with high dengue seroprevalence, a test with lower specificity might be acceptable as the proportion of seronegative individuals incorrectly vaccinated would be low. A pre- vaccination screening strategy may also be considered in low-to-moderate transmission settings. In settings with low seroprevalence a test with high specificity is needed. Given the limitations regarding specificity, some seronegative individuals may be vaccinated because of a false positive test result. Furthermore, as vaccine-induced protection against dengue in seropositive individuals is high but not complete, breakthrough disease will occur in some seropositive vaccinees. These limitations will need to be communicated to populations offered vaccination.

Decisions about implementing a pre-vaccination screening strategy with the currently available tests will require careful assessment at the country level, including consideration of the sensitivity and specificity of available tests and of local priorities, dengue epidemiology, country-specific dengue hospitalization rates, and affordability of both CYD-TDV and screening tests.

Decisions about implementing a seroprevalence criterion-based vaccination strategy without individual screening in areas with documented seroprevalence rates of at least 80% at age 9 years will require population serosurveys at high resolution, i.e. at district and sub-district level. Careful assessment is required with regard to the feasibility and cost of population seroprevalence studies. Communication needs to ensure appropriate and full disclosure of the risks of vaccination of persons with unknown serostatus.

Vaccination should be considered as part of an integrated dengue prevention and control strategy. There is an ongoing need to adhere to other disease preventive measures such as well-executed and sustained vector control. Individuals, whether vaccinated or not, should seek prompt medical care if dengue-like symptoms occur. Vaccinated patients should continue to be offered the best evidence-based clinical care for all patients with dengue.

[This position paper contains extensive background information that may be of interest to ProMED-mail readers and documents previous information circulating about the Dengvaxia vaccine. The position paper points out the dilemma of the need to determine if vaccinees have had previous dengue virus infections or not prior to administration of the vaccine. In practical terms, that would require point of care testing that is specific for dengue virus antibodies and not complicated by cross reactivity with antibodies to other flaviviruses. - Mod.TY]
