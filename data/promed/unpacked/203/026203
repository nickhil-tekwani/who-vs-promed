Foot-and-mouth disease breaks out in North Korea
------------------------------------------------
North Korea has reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations [FAO] an outbreak of the livestock foot-and-mouth
(FMD) disease on its soil, the Radio Free Asia said in a report on
Thursday [10 Feb 2011].

North Korea's agricultural ministry sent a letter to the UN
organization on Wednesday [9 Feb 2011], notifying it of the outbreak
of the contagious animal disease and asking for emergency support, the
media reported, citing a UN official.

The official did not mention the region of the outbreak nor the
number of livestock that showed FMD symptoms, it added. [Other
not-reported data are the animal species affected, the mode of
diagnosis, the vaccination status of the affected animals, and the
identity of the FMDV serotype involved. - Mod.AS]

The organization will send experts to North Korea "at an appropriate
time" to help the reclusive communist country contain the FMD disease,
it said.

North Korea confirms foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------
North Korea confirmed on Thursday [10 Feb 2011] that it has been hit
by an outbreak of FMD, saying thousands of animals had died. The
livestock disease broke out in the capital Pyongyang late last year
[2010] and has spread to 8 provinces since then, the state news agency
said.

It said the capital and North Hwanghae and Kangwon provinces had been
worst affected, with about 10 000 cows and pigs infected and thousands
of them dying. The report, quoted by the South's Yonhap News Agency,
said emergency quarantine orders have been issued across the country.

A Seoul official reported last month [January 2011] that the North
had apparently suffered an FMD outbreak but Thursday's [10 Feb 2011]
report was the 1st confirmation of the highly contagious animal
disease in the secretive communist state.

The North suffers persistent severe food shortages likely to be
worsened by livestock disease.

[As a member of the OIE, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPR Korea/North Korea) is obliged to report "within 24 hours" (an
"immediate notification") regarding the 1st occurrence or
re-occurrence of a listed disease and/or infection. It is further
obliged to submit a 6-monthly report on the absence or presence, and
evolution of all the diseases listed by the OIE and information of
epidemiological significance to other members, as well as an annual
report concerning any other information of significance to other
members.

According to OIE's website, no immediate notifications, or periodic
(6-monthly, annual) reports have been received from DPR Korea since
2007. As indicated in the country's most recent available annual
report (2007), FMD is notifiable in cattle, goats, sheep, and swine,
and routine vaccination is one of the control measures applied. During
2007, FMD was reportedly present, caused by FMDV serotype Asia 1. The
2007 report included the following data on DPR Korea's animal
population:
cattle 576 000;
swine 3 251 000;
goats 2 775 000;
sheep 165 000.
(2007 data for South Korea were 2 653 976, 9 605 831, 467 179, and
1308, respectively).

The absence of animal-health reporting from a country for 3
consecutive years is a matter of concern. FMD is one of the 7
transboundary animal diseases (TADs), defined by the FAO as "those
epidemic diseases which are highly contagious or transmissible and
have the potential for very rapid spread, irrespective of national
borders, causing serious socioeconomic and possibly public health
consequences". The other TADs on FAO's EMPRES (Emergency Prevention
Systems) list are African swine fever (ASF), avian influenza (AI),
contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), haemorrhagic septicaemia
(HS), Rift Valley fever (RVF), and rinderpest (RP). FAO's
EMPRES-Livestock programme plays a significant role in the fight
against persisting and/or spreading TADs at a global level. Early
dispatch of an expert mission to DPR Korea to help sort out the FMD
issue, as allegedly requested by the latter, is highly desirable.

Salient under EMPRES was the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme
(GREP). During 2011, FAO and OIE are planned to officially declare
rinderpest as eradicated from the globe. One of the prominent
components of a common FAO/OIE plan to secure rinderpest safety in a
rinderpest-free world, will be the continuous vigilance and periodic
reassurance that RP continues to be absent, as well as the immediate
notification and indeed investigation of any appearance of infectious
disease in domestic or wild bovines and porcines, which deserve
consideration within the differential diagnosis of rinderpest; FMD is
one of those diseases (see "Differential diagnosis" at
<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rinderpest.pdf>).

The handling of the DPR Korea FMD epizootic by FAO and OIE may serve
as a timely test-case for the ability of the international community
to attend to such events in a satisfactory manner during the shortly
expected post-rinderpest era.

The representative of 'Korea (Dem. People's Rep. of)' to the OIE is
Dr Ri Kyong Gun, director of the veterinary and anti-epizootic
Department, Ministry of Agriculture, Pyongyang. - Mod.AS
