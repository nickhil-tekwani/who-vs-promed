The Mozambican livestock authorities have yet to identify the source
of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD] that was diagnosed in
Nhamavila and Manjacaze in the southern province of Gaza in late
March 2008, according to a report on Mozambican Television (TVM).

After detecting the disease, the authorities decided to slaughter and
incinerate 45 head of cattle. These animals had been brought to Gaza
from the western province of Tete to be distributed to local
communities as part of the government's restocking programme.

The Mozambican authorities suspect that the outbreak may have started
in neighbouring Zimbabwe [see commentary].

In an effort to try and control the outbreak in Mozambique, livestock
authorities met in the district of Gondola, in Manica province, last
week.

A source close to the meeting told reporters that "Zimbabwe has been
heavily affected by FMD, but it has not yet been determined if the
outbreak started there or inside Mozambique."

As soon as the disease was detected in Mozambique, the authorities
decreed a ban on the movement of livestock from the areas where the
disease was diagnosed until the situation is fully under control.

Agriculture Minister Soares Nhaca urged all residents of the areas
where the disease was detected to act with responsibility and
strictly abide by the ban on the movement of animals.

He explained that the disease may spread by import or export of
animals, and the livestock authorities have launched an emergency
vaccination campaign to protect the animals not yet contaminated.

[The suspicion of FMD originating in Zimbabwe deserves a denial or
confirmation. Zimbabwe's endemic FMD situation and its possible role
as disease source in the region have been addressed in the past; see
postings 20060504.1283 and 20020509.4139.

According to OIE's WAHID interface, no reports from Zimbabwe are
available for the years 2006-2007; see at
