In the last fortnight, nearly 9000 cases have been reported in
Mumbai, the highest in 4 years.

Compared to other metros, Mumbai is clearly on the edge. While 8642
cases have been registered in Mumbai, Delhi has seen just 5 cases,
and Bangalore zero in the last 2 weeks.

Most cases have been reported from Central Mumbai, where over a 100
big construction projects are underway. A building in Lower Parel
which is surrounded by 3 projects has reported nearly 200 cases this
monsoon [2010].

"In this building, in every home, there are 4-5 people who have
malaria. Civic workers come for checks, but what do you expect when
there are 3 buildings being constructed around us," said a Lower
Parel resident.

Much of the blame, the health authorities say, is on the builders for
not following civic norms, which make it compulsory for them to carry
out anti-larvae treatment at construction sites.

"Since we do not want to put the lives of Mumbaikars at risk, we have
started carrying out these activities ourselves, and we will recover
the expenses from them," said Dr Girish Ambe, Executive Health
Officer, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.
